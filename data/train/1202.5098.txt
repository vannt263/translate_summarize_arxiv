    "erich leo lehmann was born in strasbourg on november  20 , 1917 .",
    "he was raised in frankfurt am main where his father was a prominent lawyer .",
    "immediately after hitler came to power in 1933 , the family left germany for switzerland , where erich finished high school and studied mathematics for two years at the university of zrich . in 1938",
    "he continued his studies at trinity college , cambridge and in january 1941 he arrived in berkeley as a graduate student at the university of california . in 1942",
    "he moved from pure mathematics to statistics . in 19441945",
    "he spent a year on guam as an operations analyst with the u.s .",
    "air force , together with his lifelong friend joseph hodges , jr .",
    "having returned to berkeley at the end of the war , erich received his ph.d . in 1946 and after that remained on the berkeley faculty throughout his career .",
    "he received many honors such as membership of both the national academy of sciences and the american academy of arts and sciences , as well as honorary doctorates at leiden and chicago .",
    "he passed away on september 12 , 2009 at the age of 91 .",
    "those who knew him well , remember him with affection .",
    "the purpose of this paper is not to present an authoritative account of erich lehmann s many achievements .",
    "that will doubtless be done at some later date .",
    "my aim is merely to describe , from a purely personal point of view , the qualities that impressed me most about erich lehmann as a scientist and a person , and that influenced my own life to a considerable extent",
    ".    luckily there exists an excellent book about erich s life and times written by himself [ @xcite ] .",
    "although this book is formally about his interactions with fellow scientists , it does present a reasonably complete picture of his thought and activities over the years . an earlier version of some of the material in this book may be found in an interview that appeared in _ statistical science _ [ @xcite ] . in @xcite",
    "erich provided an account of the history of his famous book _ testing statistical hypotheses_. another rich source of material is constance reid s biography of jerzy neyman [ @xcite ] .",
    "finally there are my own conversations and correspondence with erich that intermittently cover a period of roughly 45 years .",
    "i shall use these sources freely to discuss some of erich s activities and thoughts .",
    "erich s research was paramount to his person , so i shall begin by discussing two of his papers that i particularly like and that are typical of his research style .",
    "both papers start out with deceptively simple ideas that yield results that greatly improve our understanding of essentially complex matters . a more comprehensive view of erich s research output will be available in a volume of his selected papers that should appear shortly .",
    "lehmann ( @xcite ) is the first of these two papers .",
    "i discussed it for the volume of lehmann s selected papers , but i think the paper has a natural place here , too .",
    "it consists of two simple remarks , but of course these remarks were only found to be simple after they had been made !",
    "the setting is the power computation for two - sample rank tests .",
    "let @xmath0 be independent , with the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 having continuous distribution functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "we wish to test the hypothesis @xmath5 against the alternative that the @xmath6 s are stochastically larger than the @xmath7 s , that is , @xmath8 for all @xmath9 with strict inequality for at least one value of @xmath9 and hence on an interval .",
    "we rank the combined sample in increasing order , let @xmath10 denote the ranks of @xmath11 and define the rank test statistic @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an increasing function .",
    "the rank test rejects the hypothesis for large values of @xmath14 .",
    "the test is distribution - free in the sense that under the hypothesis the distribution of @xmath14 is independent of the common distribution @xmath3 of the observations .",
    "of course this is immediately obvious since under the hypothesis the elements of the combined sample of @xmath7 s and @xmath6 s are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) and therefore exchangeable , and hence every permutation of the ranks of the combined sample is equally probable .",
    "there is also a slightly different and perhaps less obvious argument for showing that the test is distribution - free .",
    "one simply notes that by subjecting all observations to the same increasing transformation , the common distribution @xmath3 of the combined data may be changed into any other distribution , but the ranks  and hence their distribution ",
    "remain unchanged .",
    "as we shall see , the advantage of the second argument is that it does not involve the exchangeability of the combined sample under the hypothesis and the explicit knowledge of the joint distribution of the ranks that follows from this .",
    "the problem with rank tests was the computation of the power , that is , the probability of rejection under an alternative .",
    "concentrating on shift alternatives @xmath15 for @xmath16 , it took the combined efforts of the statistics profession quite some time before this question found a satisfactory asymptotic answer as @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for fixed sample sizes",
    "the problem was considered hopeless in general .",
    "lehmann noticed that under the alternative , part of the invariance that had proved so useful under the hypothesis still survives .",
    "an increasing transformation of all of the observations still leaves the ranks unchanged .",
    "so if @xmath19 is a distribution function on @xmath20 and one considers the alternative @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 , then the increasing transformation @xmath3 of the random variables carries this into the alternative @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the uniform distribution on @xmath20 for the @xmath25 and @xmath19 the distribution function of the @xmath26 .",
    "hence for every @xmath3 , the distribution of @xmath14 under the alternative @xmath21 is the same as that under @xmath23 .",
    "the second , even simpler remark was that two years earlier wassily hoeffding had derived an expression for the distribution of the ranks in terms of the distribution of uniform order statistics [ hoeffding ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "this expression is particularly easy to compute explicitly for the case where @xmath27 for @xmath28 .",
    "so lehmann suggested considering the composite alternative @xmath29 for fixed @xmath28 and all continuous @xmath3 , for which the distribution of the ranks  and hence of @xmath14is independent of @xmath3 and equal to that for @xmath30 which is easy to compute for any sample size . as a result",
    "one can now compute the exact small sample power of the rank test for a curve of alternatives @xmath29 for varying @xmath3 and limiting results for @xmath31 are readily available . with the aid of hoeffding s formula for the distribution of the ranks under the alternative and the neyman ",
    "pearson lemma , one can find most powerful and locally most powerful tests for such alternatives .    of course this",
    "does not solve the problem of computing the power against shift alternatives because in that case the computation is still unpleasant and the resulting power will depend on @xmath3 as well as on the shift @xmath32 . in defense of his @xmath21 models for varying @xmath3",
    "as opposed to the usual shift models , lehmann points out that it seems that when distribution - free methods are appropriate `` _ _ one usually does not have very precise knowledge of the alternative .",
    "what is then required are alternatives representative of the principal types of deviation from the hypothesis , in terms of which one can study , at least in outline , the ability of various tests to detect such deviations__. '' some 60 years later many of us would agree with this sentiment .    during a meeting in berkeley on the occasion of erich s 80th birthday in 1997 ,",
    "i spoke about this paper and evoked the image of a large group of statisticians wearing themselves out by climbing the mountain of technicalities associated with the study of shift alternatives , while at the same time erich lehmann tiptoed quietly around the mountain to greet them when they got to the other side .",
    "what i did not realize at the time and only discovered when re - reading erich s interview in _ statistical science _",
    "[ @xcite ] was that erich himself also liked this paper particularly and considered it one of his favorites .",
    "after the meeting he wrote to me : `` _ _ it is rather a strange experience  at the same time embarrassing and ego - swelling  to find one s work the topic of several lectures .",
    "i hope it does not sound conceited if i say that your talk was the one that gave my work some ` personality'__. '' it seems safe to think that he liked the meeting as well as the interest in his 44-year - old paper .",
    "hodges and lehmann ( @xcite ) is the other paper i would like to discuss .",
    "again the paper advances a simple idea that could almost be called obvious , except for the fact that nobody had considered it in any generality before .",
    "earlier studies of this kind , such as @xcite or @xcite , are concerned with a single specific problem in a restricted setting . the general approach set forth in the hodges  lehmann paper led to a revival of asymptotic expansions of distribution functions that substantially strengthened large sample theory .",
    "also the paper has the unique distinction of having a title consisting of a single word !    to compare the quality of two statistical procedures @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the same problem , one may compare the sample sizes @xmath35 and @xmath36 needed to obtain the same performance from the two procedures . as a measure of performance one can think of the variance @xmath37 of an estimator or the power @xmath38 of a test of a null hypothesis against a given alternative for a given level of significance @xmath39 .",
    "if we restrict attention to tests rather than estimators , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the sample sizes needed to obtain a power @xmath40 against the given alternative for a significance level @xmath41 with procedure @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "the ratio @xmath42 may then be viewed as the efficiency of procedure @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 , that is , as a measure of how well procedure @xmath33 performs for this particular testing problem when compared to @xmath34 . in most cases of interest , however , the quantity @xmath42 is too difficult to compute , so one resorts to asymptotics .",
    "let @xmath43 be i.i.d .",
    "random variables with common density @xmath44 and consider the problem of testing the null hypothesis @xmath45 against the alternative @xmath46 for @xmath47 . for sample sizes @xmath48 we thus have a sequence of testing problems and under the usual regularity conditions the alternative hypothesis approaches the null hypothesis as @xmath18 in the sense of mutual contiguity .",
    "the level of significance @xmath41 is kept fixed and contiguity ensures that the power of any sequence of tests against this sequence of alternatives is bounded away from 0 and 1 as @xmath49 .",
    "suppose , as is often the case , that as @xmath49 the power for the @xmath50th testing problem against @xmath51 equals @xmath52 \\\\[-8pt ] \\pi_{n , b}(k(c , n ) ) & = & b_0(c ) + b_1(c)n^{-1/2 } + b_2(c)n^{-1}+ o(n^{-1 } ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for test procedures @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , smooth functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 and @xmath47 .",
    "if procedure @xmath33 is applied for sample size @xmath50 , then procedure @xmath34 should be applied with sample size @xmath55 in order to obtain the same power , so @xmath56 and hence @xmath57 typically , the functions @xmath53 and @xmath54 are smooth and this will allow us to find the _ asymptotic relative efficiency _ of procedure @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 for the sequence of alternatives @xmath51 @xmath58 as the solution @xmath59 of the equation @xmath60 if @xmath61 , then this indicates that for large samples procedure @xmath33 is preferable to procedure @xmath34 for testing against the alternative @xmath51 as procedure @xmath34 needs a sample of size @xmath62 whereas sample size @xmath50 suffices for procedure @xmath33 to achieve the same power .",
    "the problem becomes more interesting if the limiting powers @xmath63 and @xmath64 are equal and hence @xmath65 . in this case",
    "the asymptotic relative efficiency @xmath59 provides no guidance for the choice of one of the procedures , but so far we have only used the leading terms @xmath63 and @xmath64 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "hodges and lehmann suggested substituting the full expansions ( [ 1.1 ] ) in ( [ 1.2 ] ) and using the fact that @xmath66 to expand @xmath67 and use the smoothness of the functions @xmath54 to solve ( [ 1.2 ] ) and obtain an expansion for @xmath68 .",
    "they call @xmath69 the deficiency of procedure @xmath34 with respect to procedure @xmath33 and when @xmath65 one typically obtains an expansion of the form @xmath70 . the case where @xmath71 so that procedure @xmath34 needs only a bounded number of additional observations to compete with procedure @xmath33 is of course of particular interest",
    ". this occurs if @xmath72 .",
    "note that our informal discussion does not cover some of the more complex cases where the functions @xmath73 and/or @xmath74 may not be bounded and deficiencies of different orders of magnitude than @xmath75 or 1 may occur .    in their paper hodges and lehmann computed deficiencies for a number of pairs of parametric tests and estimators .",
    "the paper ends with a section ominously entitled `` further possibilities . ''",
    "the authors write : `` _ _ more interesting perhaps are a number of problems in which the deficiency concept appears to be useful , but where its application presents certain technical difficulties stemming from the fact that the computation of deficiency requires higher - order asymptotic terms than we encounter in the usual efficiency analysis__. '' of course this refers to the fact that power expansions like ( [ 1.1 ] ) are needed for deficiency calculations , whereas the leading terms @xmath63 and @xmath64 suffice for computing efficiencies .",
    "they continue by describing a few of these problems of which the first one is simply : `` _ _ what is the deficiency ( for contiguous normal shift alternatives ) of the normal scores test or of van der waerden s @xmath7-test with respect to the @xmath76-test ? _ _ '' after their earlier work on rank tests they clearly expected the rank tests to do well .",
    "when reading the paper , both peter bickel in berkeley and i in leiden understood that here was our homework assignment for the next few years . in the discussion of @xcite above , i mentioned the mountain of technicalities involved in computing the limiting power of rank tests for location alternatives , and now we were asked to find asymptotic expansions for these powers with remainder @xmath77 .",
    "all i knew about this subject was the chapter in @xcite on edgeworth expansions for sums of i.i.d .",
    "random variables and that did not seem quite sufficient .",
    "however , after months of hard labor it turned out that hodges and lehmann s optimistic view of rank tests was right .",
    "we found that for contiguous normal location alternatives , the deficiency of the normal scores test or van der waerden s test with respect to the @xmath76-test equals @xmath78 for the one - sample case and @xmath79 for the two - sample case . for large @xmath50 ,",
    "only @xmath80 additional observations are needed to make the best rank tests perform as well as the best parametric test ! also , the normal distribution is the slightly unpleasant exception referred to above .",
    "a more typical result is that for contiguous logistic location alternatives , the deficiency of wilcoxon s test with respect to the most powerful parametric test tends to a finite limit for the one- as well as the two - sample problem .",
    "even better news was that for contiguous normal location alternatives the deficiency of the permutation test based on sample means with respect to the @xmath76-test tends to zero as @xmath49 .",
    "explicit formulas for these deficiencies may be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when frank wilcoxon introduced his one- and two - sample rank tests in @xcite , the general feeling  and to some extent his own  was that these rank tests were quick - and - dirty methods that would suffer from a serious loss of power compared to classical parametric tests . since then research has consistently shown that this is not the case . through his own work and by pointing out the right problems to others",
    ", erich lehmann played a major role in this development .",
    "the latin text on the diploma of erich lehmann s honorary doctorate at leiden praises him for contributing substantially to the formulation of statistical science as a consistent mathematical theory , and for his work in areas such as nonparametric methods , estimation theory , robust methods and second - order asymptotics .",
    "the text then continues describing erich also as `` _ _ magister et amicus multorum _ _ , '' that is , teacher and friend of many , and adds that through the books he has written , he has taught and educated scholars all over the world .",
    "though all of this was written in somewhat stilted latin , it does give a succinct description of erich lehmann s accomplishments .",
    "two typical examples of his research in nonparametrics and second - order asymptotics were discussed in the previous section .",
    "let us now discuss erich s book _ testing statistical hypotheses _ and its role in the mathematization of statistics and the education of an entire generation of statisticians worldwide",
    ".    in @xcite erich tells how he came to berkeley in january 1941 to study pure mathematics , and after his first semester got a teaching assistantship with evans , chair of the mathematics department .",
    "after america s entry into the war , the university ran a training program for the army with erich as one of the instructors . in the summer of 1942",
    "evans advised him that it might be more useful for the war effort if he would switch from pure mathematics to statistics with jerzy neyman . in the fall of 1942 erich took neyman s first upper division course in statistics . at some time during the course neyman suddenly had to leave for three weeks and erich had to take over the lectures that were supposed to be his introduction to statistics as a student . to make things even scarier",
    ", there was no text for the course .",
    "after finishing the first semester of the statistics program , erich decided that he did not like statistics .",
    "he and other pure mathematics students thought statistics did not possess the beauty of number theory or other parts of pure mathematics .",
    "he felt that `` _ _ ad hoc methods based on questionable and quite arbitrary assumptions were used to solve messy problems__. '' he went to the newly appointed famous logician alfred tarski and asked if he could study algebra with him .",
    "like neyman , tarski was polish and intent to build up his own group in berkeley . that was where the similarity of the two ended and in berkeley they were called `` _ _ poles apart__. '' of course tarski was happy to have this new student , but before erich had a chance to tell neyman he was leaving , neyman offered him a promotion to lecturer at a much higher salary than his assistantship .",
    "erich decided he could not afford to turn down this offer .",
    "had the outcome been different , then this article would have been written by a different person for a different journal , with the word `` statistics '' replaced by `` algebra '' throughout .",
    "having decided to stay in the statistics program , erich started by attending neyman s basic graduate course in statistical theory and discovered that statistics was not so bad after all . in the 1930s jerzy neyman and egon pearson had succeeded in formulating a consistent mathematical model that made it possible to discuss the properties of statistical tests in mathematical terms .",
    "the course was largely based on this work and erich quickly saw that there was sensible mathematics going on . in 19441945",
    "there was a break in his graduate education when he served for a year as an operations analyst with the u.s .",
    "air force on guam to study bombing accuracy . in 1946",
    "he completed his ph.d .",
    "with neyman as advisor , and hsu and plya standing by during neyman s long absence .",
    "many of us had less impressive advisors !    after obtaining his ph.d .",
    ", erich s teaching activities started in earnest . in 1948 and 1949 neyman entrusted him with the basic graduate course on hypothesis testing .",
    "first graduate student colin blyth attended the course and took notes , and after careful reading by erich the notes were mimeographed and sold at cost , first by the statistical laboratory and later by the university bookstore . as it was the only systematic treatment of the neyman ",
    "pearson theory , the notes began to be used at other universities in the united states and abroad .",
    "of course the notes covered only the basics of the theory and the simplest applications , so there was soon an increasing demand to expand the material into a textbook .    at this point",
    "a serious conflict occurred .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite , neyman heard rumors that lehmann had not followed the script for the course closely enough in his class .",
    "indeed , erich had added some newer material , for example , on invariance . as a result , neyman would not let erich teach the course anymore , and it was only after neyman stepped down as chair of the then new statistics department in 1956 , that erich taught it again .",
    "of course this did not stop erich from working on the book and ten years after blyth s notes the first volume _ testing statistical hypotheses _ appeared in 1959 [ @xcite ] .",
    "i first saw the book when i started work on my thesis in amsterdam in january 1961 , and it made an overwhelming impression on me .",
    "of course i had been taught the basic ideas of hypothesis testing and the derivation of the distributions of various common test statistics , but it all seemed to consist of a lot of special cases without much in common .",
    "already when reading the first chapter on decision theory things started to fall into place .",
    "as a master student in mathematics i had taken a full year of measure theory with zaanen in leiden and another year of measure theoretic probability with van dantzig in amsterdam , so i could skip the probability background in chapter 2 .",
    "the remaining chapters provided a lucid account of the subject along the lines of neyman and pearson , in a logical order and written with the utmost care .",
    "a few years earlier i had taken a course of van dantzig where he discussed r.  a. fisher s attempt at providing a framework for statistical inference in his book _ statistical methods and scientific inference _",
    "[ @xcite ] .",
    "i am afraid i was unable to understand the content of this book in any mathematical sense , and neither was van dantzig who wrote a scathing review of the book [ @xcite ] . with this earlier experience in mind",
    "i was relieved to find professor lehmann s account of the neyman ",
    "pearson approach intelligible and entirely satisfactory , even though professor fisher has warned us that `` _ _ it is to be feared , therefore , that the principles of neyman and pearson s ` theory of testing hypotheses ' are liable to mislead those who follow them into much wasted effort and disappointment , and that its authors are not inclined to warn students of these dangers _ _ '' [ @xcite , page  88 ] .",
    "i am afraid i am one of those people whom professor fisher feared would be misled , but i will admit it does not bother me .",
    "i was certainly not the only one for whom _ testing statistical hypotheses _ was a revelation .",
    "the claim i made above that the book educated an entire generation of statisticians worldwide can not be far off the mark .",
    "unfortunately the sales number of the book is unknown , but in @xcite erich writes that the money he made was not nearly enough to imitate landau and build a mansion in gttingen from the proceeds of the book , but would certainly have been sufficient to buy a fancier car than the one erich was actually driving .",
    "unfortunately , total perfection does not exist and in @xcite erich writes : `` _ _ the biggest source of errors was the more than 200 problems .",
    "the difficulty often resulted from some fine points or special cases that i had overlooked and that naturally caused readers much trouble when they struggled with them .",
    "letters asking for clarification were not only painful reminders of my ineptitude but they could also take quite a bit of time and effort to answer at a time when i was no longer working in this area .",
    "i was saved from this bondage to my past errors when a heroic group of 15 dutch statisticians decided to work though the whole collection systematically and in 1984 with wiley s permission published the solutions as a 310-page book [ @xcite ] .",
    "one member of the group told me later that this was the most painful job he had ever undertaken .",
    "however , from then on i was able to answer queries about the problems with a simple reference__. '' i have to admit that i was not one of the 15 dutch heroes .",
    "the companion volume _",
    "theory of estimation _ appeared in 1983 .",
    "it also had its roots in colin blyth s mimeographed lecture notes dating back to 1950 , but the many developments since that time made even more rewriting and addition necessary . in erich s",
    "own words in the introduction , the two volumes together `` _ _ provide an introduction to classical statistics from a unified point of view__. '' what was still new in the 1950s was classical in the eighties ! since then both volumes have been revised and reprinted and there is now a third edition of _ testing statistical hypotheses _ with joseph romano as a co - author and double the number of pages , and a second edition of _ theory of point estimation _ , joint with george casella .",
    "both books continue to acquire new friends . in between erich also published _ elements of large sample theory _ , a more elementary  and easier to read  treatment of asymptotic theory than most comparable texts .",
    "his last book on fisher , neyman and the creation of classical statistics will hopefully appear in 2011 .",
    "when working on this book he wrote to me with his typical self - deprecating humor : `` _ _ i lead the kind of life appropriate to my age : taking pills , going to doctors , and sleeping during the day as well as at night .",
    "so as not to be completely idle , i putter away at a new book : fisher , neyman , and the creation of classical statistics .",
    "it is a story that i find not only scientifically interesting but also full of drama__. '' if i am allowed a single commercial , let me say that this will be the book that all of us should read .",
    "one last word about erich as `` teacher and friend of many . ''",
    "erich was always friendly to young people . a year after getting my ph.d .",
    ", i visited the united states for the first time and had a chance to attend the fifth berkeley symposium . when i entered the coffee room at the symposium , a gentleman sought me out , introduced himself as erich lehmann and started talking about my thesis .",
    "i could not believe my ears : the famous professor lehmann taking time to speak to me and actually having an idea what my thesis was about !",
    "this was typically erich : kind , considerate and generous with the younger generation , including of course his own students .",
    "this may explain that even in his nineties when his own generation had largely vanished , he had so many friends and admirers in the profession .",
    "they got together at the lehmann symposia , spoke about recent developments and generally enjoyed each other s company .",
    "this is probably the best recipe for staying young , which erich succeeded in doing until a remarkable age .",
    "i am told that in the end he was ready to go .",
    "we have known a great man that we will sorely miss .",
    "first of all , i should perhaps dispel a common misconception about erich lehmann that he actively encouraged himself .",
    "i am referring to his self - professed disinterest and inability in matters of an administrative or governing nature .",
    "many professors exhibit this behavior in hopes of being spared administrative jobs through assumed incompetence .",
    "however , even though he may not have liked it , erich knew very well how to run things and convince people .",
    "he was chair of the statistics department in berkeley and the faculty seems to agree that he was very effective : when he wanted something done , he was usually right and got it done . in his obituary for erich in _ bernoulli news _",
    ", peter bickel phrased this more elegantly by referring to erich s `` _ _ great astuteness about the world , what could be achieved , and how to do it__. ''    from 1953 through 1955 erich was editor of _ the annals of mathematical statistics_. in those days , the annals did not have a separate managing editor , so the editor s work did not stop with the final acceptance of papers to be published .",
    "he was also responsible for seeing the issues through the printing process .",
    "no wonder erich would have much preferred to continue as associate editor",
    ". however , neyman strongly encouraged him to accept the editorship , and was willing to reduce his teaching load and provide salary and space for an editorial assistant .",
    "he obviously felt that erich would do a good job , but he also thought that this would give his statistical laboratory  soon to turn into the department of statistics  some additional visibility .",
    "so erich accepted the editorship and apparently did very well , since after his three - year term he was asked to continue for another term .",
    "neyman agreed to continue the previous arrangement , erich accepted a second term , but some time later neyman turned around and said that he could no longer provide an editorial assistant .",
    "erich found this incredible and told ims president henry scheff about this , who suggested that ims could probably pay the assistant s salary .",
    "when erich told neyman about this suggestion , neyman replied that he would also need the room that the _ annals _ was using for its editorial office and would only have a windowless storeroom in the attic available for the _ annals_. neyman argued that he needed the money and the office space for the editorial assistant of the proceedings of the upcoming third berkeley syposium .",
    "erich realized that further discussion was useless and resigned as editor of the _ annals_. an acrimonious exchange of letters started between neyman and various ims council members , and in the end even david blackwell , the most reasonable person around , found neyman unwilling to listen .",
    "this is not the place to discuss the motives behind this quarrel , but only to point out that erich felt that this amounted to a definite break between neyman and himself that lasted for many years .",
    "he makes it clear , however , that neyman never took this personal problem out on his career but always tried to further it .",
    "the entire affair is recalled in detail in @xcite .",
    "a quarter of a century later erich writes that he thought `` _ _ the issue did nt warrant such an uproar and did what he could to calm the waters _ _ '' [ @xcite ] .",
    "all in all , it was a rather sad ending of an editorial job well done .",
    "let me relate a less - known instance of erich s effectiveness that ended on a much happier note . around 1960",
    "the only statistics meetings in europe were the biennial sessions of the international statistical institute ( isi ) that were held all over the world , and with some regularity in europe .",
    "however , these meetings were largely devoted to official statistics and a number of people felt that there should also be meetings of mathematical statisticians in europe .",
    "statistics was growing rapidly in europe , the united states was far away , and without regular international contacts people felt isolated .",
    "jim durbin felt strongly about this and so did henri theil , president of the econometric society , who wanted joint meetings in europe of statisticians and econometricians .",
    "theil asked isi to sponsor such european meetings , but isi declined .",
    "durbin approached ims . at the time erich was president - elect of ims and an informal meeting to discuss this matter",
    "was held in erich s home in berkeley .",
    "erich felt strongly that ims as the largest scientific society in mathematical statistics should be willing to take on an international role .",
    "he argued that one quarter of ims members lived outside the u.s .",
    "and that this proportion was rising . at its meeting in stanford in august 1960",
    "the ims council decided to initiate the holding of european regional meetings in addition to the annual meeting and the meetings of the american regions .",
    "a european regional committee was appointed and at the ims council meeting in seattle in june 1961 with erich as president , this committee recommended to hold such meetings in september 1962 in dublin and in july 1963 in copenhagen .",
    "council approved .",
    "thus the first european meeting at dublin took place two years after the idea first came to ims , which is a remarkable performance for which erich s support was indispensable .",
    "he recognized a great opportunity when he saw it and acted accordingly to convince his less internationally minded colleagues .",
    "the dublin meeting was truly memorable , with an excellent scientific program attended by 300 people , and a superb party hosted by the guinness brewery in memory of their former brewmaster w.  s. gosset , also known as student .",
    "the european meetings of statisticians continue to the present day and have played a major role in the development of statistics in europe .",
    "as henri theil retired from the project soon after the european regional committee was appointed , the main credit for what has been achieved should go to jim durbin and erich lehmann .",
    "over the years i spent many summers and two full semesters in berkeley and during these years i got to know erich lehmann pretty well .",
    "erich also visited the netherlands a number of times and in 1985 leiden university awarded an honorary doctorate to him .",
    "this happens only rarely and the last time a mathematical scientist became a doctor h.c .",
    "was a century earlier in 1885 when the laureate was thomas stieltjes , also a name well known to probabilists and statisticians .",
    "erich has given a humorous account of this event in the final chapter of @xcite .",
    "a few months before the award ceremony a delicate problem landed on my plate . when leiden university was founded in 1575 after the siege of leiden by the spanish",
    "was lifted , it adopted the motto praesidium libertatis ( bulwark of liberty ) . during world war",
    "ii , the dean of the law school lived up to this motto by protesting the firing of the jewish professors by the german occupation in a public address . faculty and students joined in this protest , the dean was arrested and the germans closed down the university .",
    "given this history , i was not surprised to receive a phone call from the rector who asked me whether i was absolutely sure that professor lehmann had no nazi taint in his past .",
    "i told him that the lehmann family left germany immediately after hitler came to power in 1933 when erich was 15 , and that erich spent a year in guam with the u.s .",
    "air force .",
    "the rector said this was all very well , but he could have been a member of the hitler jugend while still in germany .",
    "i replied that anyone who knew erich would find it very difficult to picture him in a hj uniform , but i also had to admit that the rector had a legitimate reason for wanting to avoid any risk of a possible scandal .",
    "of course i  found the whole thing rather embarrassing and i tried to ask in a roundabout way whether my friends in berkeley knew anything of relevance .",
    "of course what happened was that nobody seemed to know anything about this until somebody asked erich s wife julie who provided a perfect answer .",
    "the lehmann family was of jewish origin .",
    "erich s father had read hitler s _ mein kampf _ and , unlike many of his friends , took hitler seriously . moreover , as a prominent lawyer , he had won a major lawsuit against some important nazi .",
    "so when hitler came to power shortly after , he decided that the family should leave the country as quickly as possible , which they did .",
    "the rector was convinced but i still felt embarrassed .",
    "however , i  need not have worried .",
    "much later julie told me that both she and erich had liked the fact that somewhere in the world people still cared about these matters .",
    "the day after erich and julie arrived for a week of festivities surrounding the award ceremony , erich had a fever that took two days to control and allowed him to skip one of the nightly dinner parties offered by the rector , the dean , the department , etc . after returning to the u.s .",
    "he wrote to me : `` _ _ on the way back , i had one insight into the proceedings of last week .",
    "could the purpose of this series of 10-course dinners be to dispose of the newly baked ( doctor ) h.c.s before they can do any damage to the reputation of the acad .",
    "lugd . batav .",
    "( i.e. , leiden university ) ? _ _ ''    in a similarly fanciful but somewhat more serious vein he continued with :  _ bill , neither of us tends to take things too seriously but (  ) even at the risk of embarrassing you ( i must tell you ) of the extraordinary , liberating effect ( last week s ceremony ) had on me . _",
    "_ i grew up with great advantages and some serious disadvantages .",
    "the most important of the latter was the relationship with my father , a very outgoing , enormously successful lawyer who adored my equally outgoing , delightful and original younger brother (  ) but found little to admire in me , who was shy , reserved , and unadventurous .",
    "it is not that he mistreated me  on the contrary , he was always very nice to me  he just made it clear that i was a bit disappointing and that he had no expectations of my ever amounting to anything . over the years",
    "the weight of his disapproval has lightened some , but it has remained with me until last week when i had it out with him ( the poor man has been dead for 35 years ) .",
    "i challenged him : ` now admit that you were wrong . in my quiet boring way i did make it after all  getting the only mathematical dr h.c . from leiden in the 20th century is as big a success as any man can wish for his son  so there ! ' and he admitted it_.     in 1997 i spent two months in berkeley .",
    "i was sorry to hear that erich and julie would be in princeton at that time , but happy when they offered me the use of their apartment .",
    "for some reason they came back earlier than planned , so after being there for a month , i prepared to move out . however , they argued that since their apartment really consisted of two apartments joined together by removing a wall , i could still use the apartment on one side of the virtual wall for the remainder of my stay .",
    "of course i protested , but they refused to listen .",
    "so for one month we shared their double apartment .",
    "because erich used to get up at 5.30 a.m. to work on one of his books , he had finished the day s work by the time i got up .",
    "we had a cup of coffee and a chat and i went to the department . in the evening we had long discussions about everything under the sun",
    ". in @xcite erich writes : `` _ _ in the evenings , after dinner , we used to discuss the problems of the world over a glass of genever , a supply of which he had brought from the netherlands__. '' we may not have solved all of these problems but it was certainly fun .    in erich s",
    "last letter to me in early 2009 , there was another fanciful dream .",
    "he wrote :  _ last night you made an appearance in my dream .",
    "you introduced me to a colleague of yours who had a massive data set that she needed to analyze and you asked me to assist her in this enterprise .",
    "i reminded you that my facility with applied statistics parallels that attributed to my mother s intelligence by one of her teachers : _",
    "i wrote back that i was sorry to have disturbed his well - earned sleep and that i liked the evaluation of his mother s intelligence , though obviously false .",
    "since neither erich nor i are known for our applied work , it was perhaps just as well that it was all a dream ."
