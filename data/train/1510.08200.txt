    "<S> the energy of the des cloizeaux and pearson mode of the spinon excitations is somewhat larger than that calculated with the above exchange constant . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is mostly ascribed to the effective xy anisotropy arising from the large dzyaloshinsky@xmath4moriya interaction with an alternating @xmath5 vector . </S>",
    "<S> kcugaf@xmath1 in a magnetic field is represented by the quantum sine - gordon model , for which low - energy elementary excitations are composed of solitons , antisolitons and their bound states called breathers . unlike the theoretical prediction , it was found that the energy of a soliton is smaller than that of the first breather , although the energy of the first breather coincides with that observed in a previous esr measurement . </S>"
