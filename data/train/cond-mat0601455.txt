    "following the path integral methods devised by feynman  @xcite , kac showed  @xcite that the calculation of the pdf @xmath13 can essentially be reduced to a quantum mechanics problem , namely solving a single particle shrdinger equation in an external potential @xmath10 .",
    "this formalism is known in the literature as the celebrated feynman - kac formula .",
    "subsequently , this method has been widely used to calculate the pdf of @xmath8 with different choices of @xmath10 as demanded by specific applications .",
    "this has been reviewed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in particular ,",
    "two most popular applications correspond respectively to the choices , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the dirac s delta function and @xmath27 is the heaviside step function . in the former case , the corresponding functional @xmath28 has the following physical meaning : @xmath29 is just the time spent by the particle in the vicinity of the point @xmath30 in space , i.e. ,  in the region @xmath31 $ ] , out of the total observation time @xmath0 .",
    "note that , by definition , @xmath32 .",
    "the functional @xmath33 is known as the ` local time ' ( density ) in the literature . in the second case @xmath25 ,",
    "the functional @xmath34 measures the time spent by the particle on the positive side of the origin out of the total time @xmath0 and is known as the ` occupation ' time .",
    "the probability distribution of the occupation time was originally computed by lvy  @xcite , @xmath35 , and is known as the arcsine law of lvy . since then , the local and the occupation times for pure diffusion , have been studied extensively by mathematicians  @xcite .",
    "recently , the study of the occupation time has seen a revival in physics literature and has been used in understanding the dynamics out of equilibrium in coarsening systems  @xcite , ergodicity properties in anomalously diffusive processes  @xcite , in renewal processes  @xcite , in models related to spin glasses  @xcite , in simple models of blinking quantum dots  @xcite , and also in the context of persistence  @xcite .",
    "local and occupation times have been also studied in the context of stochastic ergodicity breaking  @xcite , first passage time  @xcite , diffusion controlled reactions activated by catalytic sites  @xcite and diffusion on graphs  @xcite . in polymer science , a long flexible polymer of length @xmath0",
    "is often modeled by a brownian path up to time @xmath0 . in this context , the local time at a position @xmath36 is proportional to the concentration of monomers at @xmath36 in a polymer of length @xmath0 .",
    "a natural and important question is how to generalize the feynman - kac formalism to calculate the statistical properties of the functionals of the type in eq .",
    "( [ definition of t ] ) when @xmath1 is not just a pure diffusion process , but it represents the position of a particle in an external random medium . while various properties of diffusion in random media have been widely studied in the past  @xcite , the study of statistical properties of functionals in random media is yet to receive its much deserved attention . in this paper",
    "we undertake this task .",
    "more precisely , we are interested in calculating the pdf @xmath13 of a functional @xmath8 as in eq .",
    "( [ definition of t ] ) where @xmath1 now evolves via the langevin equation @xmath37 where @xmath5 represents the thermal noise as in eq .",
    "( [ eq.1 ] ) and @xmath38 represents the external force , the derivative of the potential @xmath39 , felt by the particle .",
    "most generally , the external potential consists of two parts , @xmath40 , a deterministic part @xmath41 and a random part @xmath42 .",
    "the random part of the potential @xmath42 is ` quenched ' in the sense that it does not change during the time evolution of the particle , but fluctuates from one sample to another according to some prescribed probability distribution .",
    "consequently , the pdf @xmath13 will also fluctuate from one sample of the random potential to another and the goal is to compute the disorder averaged pdf @xmath43 where the @xmath44 denote the average over the distribution of the random potential .",
    "a popular model for the random potential is the celebrated sinai model  @xcite , where various disorder averaged physical quantities can be computed analytically  @xcite , and yet the results exhibit rich and nontrivial behaviors and also capture many of the qualitative behaviors of more complex realistic disordered systems .",
    "the sinai model assumes that @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents a brownian motion in space , i.e. ,  @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a gaussian white noise with mean @xmath49 and a correlator @xmath50 .",
    "the constant @xmath51 represents the strength of the random potential .    in this paper , we first present a generalization of the feynman - kac formalism to calculate the pdf @xmath13 in presence of an arbitrary external potential @xmath39 . to obtain explicit results using this formalism , we next assume that the random part of the potential is as in the sinai model , i.e. ,  our external potential is of the form @xmath52 , where @xmath46 is a brownian motion in space and @xmath41 is the non - random deterministic part of the potential .",
    "it turns out that the asymptotic behavior of the disorder averaged pdf @xmath43 , quite generically , has three different qualitative behavior depending on the curvature of the deterministic potential @xmath41 , i.e. ,  whether @xmath41 has a convex ( concave upward ) shape representing a stable potential ( i.e. ,  attractive force towards the origin ) , a concave ( concave downward ) shape representing unstable potential ( a repulsive force away from the origin ) or just flat indicating the absence of any external potential . to facilitate explicit calculation , we model the deterministic potential simply by , @xmath53 ,",
    "so that @xmath54 represents a stable potential , @xmath55 represents an unstable potential and @xmath56 represents a flat potential .",
    "this specific choice facilitates explicit calculation , but the results are qualitatively similar if one chooses another form of this potential .",
    "thus , in our model , we will consider the external potential as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the trajectory of a brownian motion in space ( see fig .",
    "[ potential ] ) .",
    "note that the case @xmath56 corresponds to the pure sinai model .",
    "figure  ( [ potential ] ) shows typical realization of potentials for @xmath56 , @xmath55 and @xmath54 . the corresponding force in eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) is simply given by @xmath59",
    "we will demonstrate how to calculate explicitly , using our generalized feynman - kac formalism , the disorder averaged pdf @xmath43 when the external potential is of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ u(x ) ] ) .",
    "despite the simplicity of the choice of the external potential , a variety of rich and interesting behavior can be obtained by tuning the parameter @xmath60 , as shown in this paper .",
    "we will present detailed results for the two functionals , namely for the local time and the occupation time corresponding to the choices @xmath61 and @xmath25 respectively in eq .",
    "( [ definition of t ] ) .",
    "also , to keep the discussion simple , we will present our final results for @xmath62 corresponding to the particle starting at the origin .",
    "however , our method is not limited only to this specific choice .",
    "some of these results were briefly announced in a previous letter  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in this paper we also introduce the notion of ` inverse functional ' , which is defined as follows . if @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ definition of t ] ) is non - negative , then for each path @xmath12 , @xmath8 is a non - decreasing function of @xmath0 , which we formally denote by @xmath63 .",
    "therefore for a given realization of path @xmath12 and given @xmath8 there is a unique value of @xmath0 ( see fig .",
    "[ t - t ] ) , which we formally write as the inverse of the functional @xmath64   @xmath65 this inverse time @xmath0 physically means the observation time that is required for any given path @xmath12 in order to produce a prescribed value of @xmath8 .",
    "of course , for the same value @xmath8 , for a different path @xmath12 , the value of @xmath0 will be different .",
    "thus , @xmath0 is a random variable for a fixed @xmath8 , which takes different values for different realizations of paths and we would like to compute its pdf , which we denote by @xmath66 and by definition @xmath67 .",
    "clearly , this pdf will also differ from sample to sample of the external potential in eq .",
    "( [ u(x ) ] ) and our goal is to obtain the disorder averaged distribution @xmath68 . in this paper , we present detailed results for @xmath69 again for the two choices of @xmath61 and @xmath25 corresponding to the local time and the occupation time respectively .",
    "the inverse local and occupation times are useful for experimentalists as they provide an estimate on the required measurement time . for example",
    ", in the context of polymers , the inverse local time is the typical length of a polymer required to obtain a certain monomer concentration .",

    "we consider the specific examples of local time and occupation time by setting @xmath61 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "we will use different notations for the pdfs in the two examples to avoid any misunderstanding . in the first example , where @xmath8 is the local time",

    "[ summary ] contains some concluding remarks .",
    "some of the details are relegated to the appendixes .",
    "the results are summarized in tables  [ table - flat ] , [ table - unstable ] , and [ table - stable ] .",
    "in this section we will show how to compute the pdfs @xmath70 and @xmath71 for arbitrary non - negative @xmath10 and arbitrary starting position @xmath72 , for each realization of random force @xmath84 , by using a backward fokker - planck equation approach . in the following discussion",

    "( [ def - q ] ) .",
