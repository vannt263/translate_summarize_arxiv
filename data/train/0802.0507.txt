    "luminous supersoft x - ray sources were discovered with the einstein observatory and were established as an important new class of x - ray binaries based on rosat observations of 18 sources in the milky way and the magellanic clouds ( kahabka & van den heuvel 1997 and reference therein ) .",
    "these sources have extremely soft spectra with equivalent blackbody temperatures of 15 - 80 ev and are highly luminous with bolometric luminosities of @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "they are thought to be white dwarfs that are steadily or cyclically burning hydrogen accreted onto the surface .",
    "remarkably , the accretion rates must be in a narrow range of @xmath4 , and the resultant luminosities are below @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 as observed .",
    "white dwarfs with steady nuclear burning are promising type ia supernova progenitors because , unlike explosive nova events , they can retain the accreted matter and their mass can increase until it approaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "more and more supersoft sources have been discovered in distant galaxies with the advent of the chandra and xmm - newton x - ray observatories .",
    "these distant supersoft sources , as compared to the canonical ones , are generally hotter , more luminous and often associated with spiral arms , suggesting that some are young and massive systems ( di stefano & kong 2004 ) . some have bolometric luminosities , as derived from blackbody models , far above the eddington luminosity ( @xmath5 erg s@xmath1 ) for white dwarfs , which we call ultraluminous supersoft sources ( ulsss ) , or uls as a more compact name .",
    "one prototype ulsss is m101-ulx1 , which showed supersoft spectra of @xmath6 ev , 0.3 - 7 kev luminosities of @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 and bolometric luminosities of @xmath8 erg s@xmath1 during its 2004 outburst ( kong et al .",
    "while the supersoft spectrum can be explained by a white dwarf burning accreted materials on its surface , the white dwarf can not explain the luminosities that are extremely super - eddington for white dwarfs of @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , an intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) of @xmath10 , as kong et al .",
    "suggested , can naturally explain both the high bolometric luminosities and the supersoft spectrum given the scaling relation @xmath11 between the black hole mass and the accretion disk inner edge temperature .",
    "intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath12-@xmath13 ) have played an important role in the hierarchical merging scenario of galaxy formation ( madau & rees 2001 ) . they have long been searched for in the cores of globular clusters , but iron - clad evidence is lacking ( for a review , see miller & colbert 2004 ) . recently , much interest has been directed toward ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) , which have been found to exist outside the nuclear regions with @xmath14-@xmath15 erg / sec in many nearby galaxies ( miller & colbert 2004 ) .",
    "such luminosities require imbhs of @xmath2 if ulxs radiate at @xmath16 eddington level as do many active galactic nuclei and galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "one type of evidence for imbhs comes from the x - ray spectroscopy that reveals a cool accretion disk component with the inner edge temperature of a few @xmath17 ev , which corresponds to an imbh of a few @xmath18 if the inner edge of the accretion disk corresponds to the last stable orbit ( miller et al . 2004 ) .",
    "however , in many cases the cool component is dominated by a hard power - law component",
    ". this hard component resembles those from the hot corona in stellar black hole x - ray binaries that will erode and envelope the inner part of the accretion disk , raising doubts against the imbh interpretation and suggestions that ulxs may be black holes of 20 - 100 @xmath19 in very high state ( done & kubota 2006 ; soria 2007 ) . indeed",
    ", ulxs can , from a theoretical perspective , be stellar mass black holes with beaming effects or radiating at super - eddington levels with the photon - bubble instability operating in a radiation pressure dominated magnetized accretion disk ( begelman 2002 ) .",
    "ultraluminous supersoft sources , with bolometric luminosities @xmath20 erg s@xmath1 and supersoft spectra of @xmath21 ev , are more promising imbh candidates ( kong et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) . as compared to ulxs , ulssss exhibit spectra that do not show a hard power - law component , making it ( more ) reasonable to link the temperature to the inner edge of the accretion disk , thereby strongly suggesting an imbh as the accretor .",
    "ulssss can be the ultraluminous version of the canonical supersoft sources as ulxs can be stellar black holes .",
    "however , given the nature and dimension of the surface nuclear burning for white dwarfs , it is unlikely to make apparent super - eddington emitters with beaming effects or the photon - bubble instability in magnetized accretion disks as proposed for stellar black holes in ulxs . of course",
    ", applying white dwarf atmosphere models to supersoft source spectra may reduce their bolometric luminosities by a factor of ten ( van teeseling et al . 1996 ) , hence alleviating the super - eddington problem for some ulssss , but it is unlikely to push the most luminous ones below the eddington limit .",
    "swartz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) observed the nearby spiral galaxy m81 with chandra acis , and discovered an intriguing ulsss in the bulge at r.a.=09:55:42.2 , decl.=69:03:36.5 , which we designate as m81-uls1 in this paper .",
    "liu ( 2007 ) studied the spectral properties of this ulsss with 17 chandra acis observations , and found its spectra persistently supersoft in six years despite dramatic flux changes .",
    "the spectrum from the longest observation can be well fitted in 0.3 - 2 kev by an absorbed blackbody model for a nuclear burning white dwarf , with @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xmath24 , @xmath25 ev , @xmath26 erg s@xmath1 , and @xmath27 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the spectrum can be equally well fitted by a multicolor disk model , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 @xmath24 , @xmath30 ev and @xmath31 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the inner disk radius derived from the model normalization is @xmath32 km , which corresponds to an imbh of @xmath33 , assuming @xmath34 corresponds to the last stable orbit .",
    "thus , the x - ray spectra are suggestive of m81-uls1 being either a white dwarf or an imbh .",
    "observations in other wavelengths can shed light on the nature of this class of x - ray sources .",
    "we have embarked on an effort to study such sources in nearby galaxies with hst observations . in this letter",
    "we report the optical studies of m81-uls1 with hst archive data .",
    " 2 describes the hst archive data sets utilized , the optical identification and photometric measurements of uls1 .",
    "the photometric measurements of uls1 are interpreted in light of the white dwarf model and the imbh model in  3 .",
    "we discuss our results and their implications in  4 .",
    "the distance of m81 is taken to be 3.63 mpc ( @xmath35 mag ; freedman et al .",
    "1994 ) in this work .",
    "hst has observed the sky region around uls1 several times ( table 1 ) .",
    "these include an observation on 1996 - 01 - 01 in filters wfpc2/f547 m ( 3@xmath3630s ) and wfpc2/f656n ( 3@xmath36600s ) , an observation on 2003 - 09 - 18 in filters acs / wfc f658n ( 700s ) and acs / wfc f814w ( 120s ) , an observation on 2004 - 09 - 14 in acs / wfc f814w ( 1650s ) , and an observation on 2006 - 03 - 27 in filters acs / wfc f435w ( 465s ) and acs / wfc f606w ( 470s ) .",
    "all data sets were downloaded from mast and calibrated on - the - fly with the best calibration files as of november 7 , 2007 .    to identify the x - ray sources on the hst images , we register both the hst images and the chandra images onto the 2mass reference frame .",
    "this was achieved by identifying 11 2mass sources on the acs / wfc f814w image taken in 2004 , and two 2mass sources on the combined chandra image .",
    "after both were registered onto the 2mass reference frame , the x - ray image was overlayed onto the acs / wfc f814w image .",
    "six x - ray sources were coincident with optical objects within error circles of @xmath37 , including uls1 that is identified with a point - like object .",
    "this object appeared in all hst observations ( figure 1 ) , and is located in the smooth bulge of m81 with the closet object of equal brightness in f814w @xmath38 away .",
    "the photometry for this point - like object was calculated with an aperture of @xmath37 on wfpc2/pc1 and acs / wfc images .",
    "the count rates and the corresponding magnitudes in the vegamag photometric system are listed in table 1 for the counterpart in the seven observations .",
    "we calculate the magnitudes for two @xmath39 filters with synphot assuming an @xmath39 emission line atop the continuum of the bruzual stellar spectrum bz_55 ; this spectrum , with an intrinsic color @xmath40 as similar to observed , is normalized to give the observed f547 m magnitude .",
    "the observations require an @xmath39 emission line luminosity of @xmath41 erg s@xmath1 during the 1996 wfpc2/f656n observation , and @xmath42 erg s@xmath1 during the 2003 wfc / f658n observation .",
    "the optical counterpart of uls1 , placed at the distance of m81 , has an absolute magnitude of @xmath43 mag , a color of @xmath40 as for k - m stars , and @xmath44 as for late b stars .",
    "the red color and absolute magnitudes in f547 m and f814w might be obtained from a massive old globular cluster of @xmath45 k - m dwarfs .",
    "however , the same globular cluster can not explain the late b - like blue color of @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , the variabilities in the @xmath39 and f814w bands suggest that the counterpart is a single object . for single objects , such a brightness and red color in f547 m and f814w are not seen in dwarf / giant / supergiant stars as tabulated in _",
    "allen s astrophysical quantities _ ( cox 2000 ) , but can be seen in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars that are burning hydrogen / helium in shells and shine as a blackbody .",
    "we note , however , the object is considerably bluer than agb stars with the same f814w luminosities , and there must be a bluer component in addition to the agb star to account for the observed colors and magnitudes simultaneously . to quantify the agb star properties in term of the core mass ( @xmath47 ) , we adopt the luminosity core - mass relation @xmath48 ( paczynski 1970 ) , the core - mass radius relation @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ; rappaport et al .",
    "1995 ) and stefan - boltzman s law @xmath51 .",
    "a natural explanation for the blue component is that it originates from the accretion disk .",
    "if the accretor is a white dwarf , the accretion disk is illuminated by the soft x - ray emission from the white dwarf surface . given the high x - ray luminosity",
    ", such a disk shall flare up geometrically , intercept a large fraction of the x - ray emission and re - emit in lower energies ( popham & di stefano 1996 ) .",
    "the emergent spectrum will take a form of @xmath52 in the optical ( fkr 2002 ) .",
    "we calculate the f547 m , f435w , 606w , and f814w ( 2004 ) magnitudes with synphot for an agb star plus a powerlaw of @xmath52 , for different core masses and relative contributions from the two components , and compute the quantity @xmath53 as a sum of the squared differences between the observed and model magnitudes . by minimizing @xmath54 , we found at @xmath55 the best combination of the @xmath52 powerlaw component and an agb star , which has @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this model , as plotted in figure 2 , can not explain the observations because it does not give enough blue light in f435w . the blackbody spectral fit to the x - ray data ( liu 2007 ) is overplotted for comparison ; clearly , a white dwarf itself would be too dim in the optical to explain the observations .    if the accretor is an imbh and thus the high x - ray luminosity is less than a few percents of the eddington luminosity , the accretion disc will be a standard geometrically - thin optically - thick one ( shafee et al .",
    "the spectrum of such a thermal disk is conventionally described by a multi - color disc ( mcd ) model ( mitsuda et al . 1984 ) . the power - law component with @xmath59 for",
    "the mcd spectrum may extend down to the optical if the outer disk radius is large .",
    "for uls1 , this means @xmath60 , which is reasonably small ( @xmath61 ) as compared to the giant star size or the roche lobe size of the black hole . with similar procedures as in the white dwarf model ,",
    "the four observed magnitudes determine a best combination , at @xmath62 , of the @xmath63 powerlaw component and an agb star , which has @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the model , plotted in figure 3 with the mcd model fit ( liu 2007 ) overplotted for comparison , can explain all four observed magnitudes . remarkably , the required @xmath63 power - law component in the optical is consistent to within 30% with the mcd fit to the x - ray spectrum .    the properties of the companion agb star may differ considering the uncertainties in the theory and the observations .",
    "in particular , the analytical form for the core - mass radius relation for agb stars , adopted for the convenience of calculations , tends to overestimate the radius ( rappaport et al .",
    "1995 ) . to test how this affects our results , we re - calculate the models by setting @xmath67 , i.e. , reducing the radius by 33% . under this simplistic modification",
    ", we find an agb star with @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 for the white dwarf model , and an agb star with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the imbh model .",
    "the white dwarf model has a @xmath74 and can not explain all the observations because it does not give enough blue light .",
    "the imbh model can fit all the observations simultaneously , but to a less satisfactory level ( @xmath75 ) as compared to the model with @xmath76 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the newly computed agb star is hotter and more compact .",
    "it has a less massive core ( @xmath77 ) , which is consistent with the final core masses of agb stars with heavy stellar wind ( weidemann 2000 ) .",
    "if the agb star is at its final stage , its core mass indicates an initial mass greater than @xmath78 and a lifetime shorter than 0.1 gyrs ( vassiliadis & wood 1993 ) .",
    "ultraluminous supersoft sources ( ulssss ) , as x - ray spectroscopy suggests , are possibly the long - sought intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) , or massive white dwarfs that are progenitors of type ia supernovae .",
    "we note that the accretion disk behaves quite differently in presence of an imbh accretor or a white dwarf accretor for the same x - ray luminosities , and observations in optical and infrared are capable to pick up the differences . in this letter , we report the optical studies with hst archive observations of m81-uls1 , a ulsss in the m81 bulge .",
    "to summarize , the spectral energy distribution of m81-uls1 in the optical reveals a blue component in addition to the companion of an agb star .",
    "the blue component is consistent with a @xmath59 power - law as expected from the geometrically - thin accretion disk around an imbh accretor , but inconsistent with a @xmath79 pow - law as expected from the x - ray irradiated flared acrretion disk around a white dwarf accretor .",
    "this is strong observational evidence that m81-uls1 is an imbh instead of a white dwarf .",
    "the hst archive observations , however , were taken at different times spanning six years .",
    "this may affect our conclusion because the differences between different bands could result ( partly ) from the intrinsic variabilities of the accretion disk and the agb companion .",
    "the accretion disk may have changed as suggested by the x - ray variability over the years , while agb stars are known to be long period variables with amplitudes of up to @xmath80 .",
    "the marginally significant change in the f814w magnitudes from two observations separated by one year may have reflected such variabilities .",
    "simultaneous observations in multiple bands are thus required to make clear whether and how much the spectral energy distribution in this work was contaminated by the variabilities .",
    "while such simultaneous observations may change the details of the agb companion and the accretion disk , they probably will not change the main conclusion that the blue component comes from a @xmath81 powerlaw instead of a @xmath79 power .",
    "this is because the distinguishing power of the optical data mainly comes from the blue color between f435w and f606w ( or f547 m ) as illustrated in figures 2 and 3 , yet f435w and f606w were already observed simultaneously .",
    "the conclusion would be invalidated if the optical counterpart were an interloper close to m81-uls1 by projection .",
    "such projection , however , is unlikely because the probability of finding such an agb star in a @xmath37 error circle by chance is quite small ( @xmath82 ) , as calculated from the the error circle size and the fact that no stars of equal brightness were found within @xmath83 . also , the prominent @xmath39 emission is suggestive of the photoionization of surrounding materials by the soft x - ray emission from uls1 , and the @xmath39 variation between two observations is somehow expected due to the long term x - ray variability of uls1 ( liu 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , a companion of an agb star with a supergiant size , if overflowing or underfilling its roche lobe , implies a period of 30 years or longer , which is consistent with the failure to detect any period from the six year chandra observations ( liu 2007 ) .",
