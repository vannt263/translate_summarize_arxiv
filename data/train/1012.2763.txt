    "a _ generalised triangle group _ is a group @xmath0 with a presentation of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 are integers and @xmath5 is a word of the form @xmath6 , ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath10 is called the _",

    "a conjecture of rosenberger @xcite asserts that a tits alternative holds for generalised triangle groups :    [ rc ] let @xmath0 be a generalised triangle group .",

    "this conjecture has been verified in a large number of special cases .",
    "( see for example the survey in @xcite . )",
    "in particular it is now known :    * when @xmath12 @xcite ; * when @xmath13 @xcite ; * when @xmath14 @xcite ; * when @xmath15 @xcite ; * for @xmath16 @xcite ; * for @xmath17 and @xmath10 odd @xcite .    in the present note",
    "we describe a proof of the rosenberger conjecture for the case @xmath18 .",
    "using essentially the same argument , we also prove the conjecture in the case where @xmath19 and @xmath10 is even  with the exception of @xmath20 groups that our methods are unable to handle .",
    "the proofs rely to some extent on computations using the computer algebra package gap @xcite .",
    "the strategy of proof , however , is straightforward .",
    "firstly , a theoretical analysis shows that , if @xmath0 is a generalised triangle group @xmath0 of type @xmath21 that does not contain a non - abelian free subgroup , then the corresponding _ trace polynomial _ must have a very restricted form .",
    "in particular this analysis provides a bound @xmath22 for the length parameter @xmath10 of such a group .",
    "secondly , a computer search finds all words of length up to @xmath23 whose trace polynomial has this restricted form .",
    "there turn out to be precisely @xmath24 such words ( up to a standard equivalence relation ) , of which @xmath25 have length @xmath15 : the conjecture is already known for the @xmath25 groups corresponding to these short words . finally , it is observed that , in the remaining @xmath26 cases , a small cancellation condition applies to @xmath0 ( regarded as a quotient of @xmath27 ) .",
    "we complete the proof by showing that the small cancellation condition implies the existence of a non - abelian free subgroup .",
    "the small cancellation arguments applied to do this yield somewhat more general results which may be of independent interest , so we present these in a more general form in  [ sc ] below .",
    "the theoretical analysis of the case @xmath19 , @xmath10 even , is identical , subject to two provisos .",
    "firstly , an equivalence class of words in the @xmath21 case can correspond to either one or two equivalence classes of words of even length in the @xmath28 case .",
    "( here _ equivalence _ refers to some standard moves on words @xmath29 that do not change the trace polynomial or the isomorphism type of the resulting group . see  [ equiv ] for details . ) secondly , these words are twice as long as their @xmath21 counterparts .",
    "the latter difference means that fewer of them are already dealt with by existing results .",
    "section [ sc ] below contains the small - cancellation results mentioned above .",
    "sections [ equiv ] and [ tp ] contain respectively a discussion of the equivalence relation on words , and some elementary results on their trace polynomials .",
    "the proof of the main result on generalised triangle groups of type @xmath21 is in section [ s332 ] , and in section [ s232 ] we discuss the variations needed to attack generalised triangle groups of type @xmath28 with even length parameter .",
    "section [ comp ] contains some remarks about the computational aspects of the work , including a description of the search algorithm .",
    "logs of gap sessions performing some of the calculations are contained in an appendix .",
    "tables at the end of the paper list all words ( up to equivalence ) whose trace polynomials do not immediately imply the existence of free subgroups in the corresponding group .",
    "an ancillary file attached to this preprint contains the gap code listings used in the search algorithm .    * acknowledgement *    i am grateful to gerald williams for helpful discussions on some of the work presented in this paper .",
    "in this section we prove two results on one - relator products of groups where the relator satisfies a certain small cancellation condition . we will apply these specifically to generalised triangle groups of types @xmath21 and @xmath28 respectively , but as the results seem of independent interest , we prove them in the widest generality available .",

    "( here and throughout this section , _ length _ means length in the free product sense . )",
    "a word @xmath32 is called a _ piece _ if there are words @xmath33 with @xmath34 , such that each of @xmath35 , @xmath36 is cyclically reduced as written , and each is equal to a cyclic conjugate of @xmath37 or of @xmath38 .",

    "specifically , groups 1a , 1b , 2 , 3 , 4a and 6 are known to be finite of the given orders @xcite , while group 4b was shown to contain non - abelian free subgroups in @xcite ( by observing that its unique subgroup of index @xmath2 is the group 4 in table 1 ) .",
    "the remaining two groups can be dealt with by calculations using gap @xcite in group 5 , the normal closure of @xmath292 has index @xmath293 and is free abelian of rank @xmath20 , while in group 8 the normal closure of @xmath294 has a non - abelian free homomorphic image of rank @xmath168 .",
    "( logs of gap sessions performing these calculations are shown in the appendix . )",
    "the main computational aspect of this work is the search for words with appropriate trace polynomials . by lemma [ 332to232 ]",

    "it is convenient to store the word @xmath29 in the form of the list @xmath314 $ ] of positive integers .",
    "the gap @xcite command ` orderedpartitions ' produces all such lists .    at this point",
    "we encounter a software problem : the output of ` orderedpartitions(40,20 ) ' , for example , should be a list of more than @xmath315 lists , which would exceed gap s upper bound for list lengths .",
    "so the command ` orderedpartitions(40,20 ) ' will lead to an error .",
    "however , we can overcome this problem as follows .",
    "it turns out from the formulae in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 9 ) that , just as the second coefficient @xmath316 of @xmath177 determines the length of the list corresponding to @xmath29 , the third coefficient @xmath317 determines the number of elements in that list which are equal to @xmath58 . to see this , note that @xmath318 from @xmath10 and @xmath316 we can calculate @xmath319 , and hence determine how many of the @xmath320 are equal to @xmath134 .",
    "this in turn enables us to calculate @xmath321 .",
    "hence , if we also know @xmath317 , we can calculate @xmath322 . on the other hand , the expression @xmath308 enables us to count the number of @xmath298 for which @xmath323 : this happens precisely at the beginning and the end of each syllable @xmath324 or @xmath325 for which @xmath326 ( resp . , @xmath327 ) .",
    "reconciling this with our previous calculation of @xmath322 tells us how many entries in @xmath328 are equal to @xmath58 .",
    "we omit the details , but when @xmath329 with @xmath223 as in theorem [ tpoly2 ] , the calculation shows that the resulting list @xmath328 has    * length @xmath330 with @xmath331 entries equal to @xmath58 , if @xmath332 ; * length @xmath330 with @xmath333 entries equal to @xmath58 , if @xmath334 and @xmath335 ; * length @xmath336 with @xmath337 entries equal to @xmath58 , if @xmath338 and @xmath339 ; * length @xmath336 with @xmath331 entries equal to @xmath58 , if @xmath340 .",
    "now an ordered partition @xmath42 of @xmath341 into @xmath342 positive integers , of which precisely @xmath343 are equal to @xmath58 , can be completely described by two simpler partitions .",
    "the first is the partition of @xmath344 into @xmath345 parts , obtained by subtracting @xmath58 from each element of @xmath42 and then removing the zeroes .",
    "the second is a partition of @xmath342 into @xmath346 positive integers , which encodes which entries of @xmath42 are equal to @xmath58 .",
    "this gives us an algorithm implementable in gap for conducting the search .",
    "use ` orderedpartitions ' to create two lists of lists . for each pair in list1 @xmath347 list 2 , create a list that corresponds to a word . calculate its trace polynomial : if this matches the form in corollary [ tpoly2 ] then add it to the output .    in practice",
    "we refine this algorithm in a number of ways .    1 .",
    "we wish our output to contain only one word from each equivalence class .",
    "ideally , we could select only one word from each equivalence class before calculating the trace polynomial , but this is not very efficient to do .",
    "a good compromise is to apply a fast - but - crude filter before the event ( which will occassionally let through two or more equivalent words while ensuring that at least one word from each class gets through ) , and then to apply a less efficient but rigorous filter to the ( much smaller ) output data .",
    "2 .   before calculating trace polynomials",
    ", we apply a further filter to check that @xmath0 admits the appropriate essential permutation representations ( onto @xmath233 , @xmath348 , @xmath235 ) .",
    "this reduces the number of matrix calculations that are required .",
    "we replace the trace polynomial calculation by an amended version , that enables us to find the value of @xmath177 for integer values of @xmath178 using only matrices with integer entries ( which is more efficient than doing matrix calculations over a polynomial ring ) . to test for correctness of the trace polynomial",
