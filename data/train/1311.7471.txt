    "in the process of the planetesimal formation , motion and growth of dust aggregates in the protoplanetary disks are key issues .",
    "the significant problem in the process of the planetesimal formation is the radial drift of meter - sized dust ( @xcite ) . to resolve this problem , gravitational instabilities ( gi ) in a thin dust layer",
    "are considered as one of the solutions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gi is expected to produce km - sized aggregates in short dynamical time scale when the density of the dust layer exceeds the critical density that is given by @xmath0 } \\right)^{-3 } \\ , [ \\mathrm{g } \\ , \\mathrm{cm}^{-3 } ] \\mathrm { , } \\label{eq:01}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the heliocentric distance ( @xcite ) .",
    "the thin dust layer is supposed to form from dust aggregates settling toward the midplane ( @xcite , 1986 ) . however , vertical gradient of dust abundance is indicated to induce the vertical shear of the azimuthal velocity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the shear is expected to induce the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "khi is expected to induce shear - driven turbulence that prevents dust aggregates from settling for gi ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "previous studies indicate that gi tends to be occur when dust abundance is high ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , with taking account of dust growth , hasegawa & tsuribe ( 2013 , hereafter ht13 ) indicated that khi tended to occur before gi even in the case with large dust abundance . in ht13 , in order to investigate dust densities in the midplane at the onset of khi , we used the richardson number ( @xcite ) and a criterion that the minimum value of the richardson number distribution @xmath2 is the critical value @xmath3 .",
    "however , @xmath3 is derived only for the case with the incompressible , inviscid and laminar fluid .",
    "there are many previous studies of the richardson criterion and the critical richardson number ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "they show that the critical richardson number depends on the assumed density profile , and it is suggested that dust abundance and dust sedimentation are important for understanding khi .",
    "other than the critical richardson number , @xcite and @xcite calculated the growth rate of khi by solving the linear perturbation equation .",
    "however , dust densities used in @xcite were limited to be smaller than the critical density for gi .",
    "@xcite investigated only the case with a particular dust density distribution .    in this paper , the growth rate of khi",
    "is calculated using the linear stability analysis with the dust density distribution that is consistent with their sedimentation in the protoplanetary disk . in  2 , the models of gas and dust components in the protoplanetary disk in this paper and equations for the linear stability analysis are described . in  3 , we show results for the growth rate and the critical richardson number , and we discuss the validity of a criterion @xmath4 used in ht13 . in  4 , we summarize our results .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig:01 ] , it is seen that the dust density in the case with @xmath68 approximates the dust density in the case with @xmath67 .",
    "since it is technically difficult to calculate the case with exactly @xmath67 especially in the case with the large dust abundance parameter @xmath10 , we use the dust density for @xmath68 instead of that for @xmath67 except for case b with @xmath11 and b with @xmath65 .",
    "for the two cases b with @xmath11 and b with @xmath65 , we use the dust density for @xmath69 instead of that for @xmath67 .",
    "( 74mm,74mm)figure1.eps    figure [ fig:02 ] shows dust densities at the midplane as functions of dust abundance . a label a - j refers the case a ( with single - sized dust ) with @xmath70 ,",
    "a label a-@xmath71 refers the case a with @xmath68 , a label b - j refers the case b ( with multi - sized dust ) with @xmath70 , and a label b-@xmath71 refers the case b with @xmath69 ( case b-1 ) or @xmath68 ( other cases ) . from figure [ fig:02 ]",

    "especially , the dust density at the midplane @xmath59 in the case b-@xmath71 with @xmath73 remarkably coincides with that in the case b - j , and the dotted and solid lines look like overlapping .",
    "( 74mm,74mm)figure2.eps    in figure [ fig:02 ] , it is seen that dust abundance parameters required to achieve @xmath74 for the case with @xmath70 are @xmath75 in the case a - j and @xmath76 in the case b - j . on the other hand , in the case with @xmath72",
    ", it is seen that dust abundance parameters required for @xmath74 are @xmath77 in the case a-@xmath71 and @xmath78 in the case b-@xmath71 . for above results ,",
    "values of dust abundance parameters @xmath10 are larger than values in ht13 that are @xmath79 in the case a - j and @xmath80 in the case b - j .",
    "this is because the initial dust density distribution in this paper is different from the gaussian profile used in ht13 . from equation ( [ eq:07 ] ) , the richardson number distribution depends strongly on the dust density profile , so dust abundance required for gi varies with the initial dust density distribution even with the same @xmath2 .    from figure",
    "[ fig:02 ] , dust abundance parameters required to achieve @xmath74 in the case with multi - sized dust is much smaller than these in the case with single - sized dust .",
    "this tendency is similar to the result in ht13 .",
    "it is suggested that this tendency is independent on the initial distribution of the dust density .    in summary , it is found that , for both cases with single - sized dust and with multi - sized dust , the dust abundance parameters significantly coincide between the cases with @xmath72 and with @xmath70 .",

    ", we calculate the spatial profile of a richardson number as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "then we obtain a minimum value of the richardson number in this profile as the critical richardson number .",
    "figure [ fig:03 ] shows the minimum values of richardson numbers in the case with @xmath69 ( cases b-1 and b-2 ) or @xmath68 ( other cases ) as functions of dust abundance . for the case a ( with single - sized dust ) , the critical richardson number tends to decrease with increasing dust abundance . on the other hand , for the case b ( with multi - sized dust )",
    ", the critical richardson number tends to increase with dust abundance in the case with @xmath73 and to approach 0.25 in the case with @xmath81 .",
    "this result is different from that in the case a. from these results , in the case with the dust size distribution it is suggested that the critical richardson number might be approximated by 0.25 and that @xmath70 condition is applicable , at least in the case with @xmath82 .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the growth rate of the kelvin - helmholtz instability using the dust density distribution that is consistent with dust sedimentation in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "we assumed the thin dust layer and the uniform gas density .",
    "dust aggregates were assumed to be small , so the mixture of gas and dust aggregates was treated as one component fluid . we considered the dust size distribution without the dust growth .",
    "we have solved the linear perturbation equation to calculate the growth rate , and we have examined the dust abundance required for the gravitational instability of the dust layer .    our study shows the following results : ( 1 ) for the dust abundance required for the gravitational instability , in the both cases without and with the dust size distribution , the dust abundance for the case with @xmath72 is about the same as that derived by the condition @xmath70 .",
    "thus , it is seen that dust abundance parameters that ht13 calculated using a criterion @xmath4 are reasonable at least with errors of a factor of 2 .",
    "( 2 ) the critical richardson number is affected by the dust size distribution . in the case without the dust size distribution , the critical richardson number tends to decrease with increasing dust abundance . on the other hand , in the case with the dust size distribution",
    ", the critical richardson number tends to increase and approach 0.25 with increasing dust abundance in the case with @xmath82 .",
    "thus , it is indicated that @xmath70 condition is applicable in the case with the dust size distribution in the case with @xmath82 .    in this paper , we neglect the streaming instability ( si ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the growth rate of si decreases with decreasing the stopping time of the dust aggregate .",
    "it is shown that dust aggregates are highly porous ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "porous dust aggregates have small stopping times ; thus khi might occur before si .",
    "this problem will be addressed in subsequent papers .",
    "the coriolis and tidal forces are not included in the linear perturbation equation ( [ eq:14 ] ) . @xcite performed the linear stability analysis including these forces and found that the tidal force plays an important role in the stabilization .",
