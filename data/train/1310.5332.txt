    "the pierre auger observatory is situated in the argentinian province mendoza , close to the city of malarge .",
    "it consists of a 3000 km@xmath1 surface detector array and a set of 24(+3 ) fluorescence telescopes .",
    "the surface detector stations are water cherenkov tanks each equipped with 3 photomultipliers measuring light induced by electromagnetic particles and muons .",
    "six fluorescence telescopes occupy one fluorescence detector building . in total four of these buildings",
    "are located on the array border on small hills and thus overlook the interior of the array measuring the longitudinal profile of electromagnetic shower @xcite . already in the year 2008",
    "the observatory was fully completed with successful operation of all four fluorescence detector buildings and by fulfilling the original aim of 1600 deployed and working surface detector stations . during the next years",
    "several observatory enhancements were built such as 3 high elevation atmospheric telescopes ( heat ) and amiga infill both used to to lower the energy threshold below 10@xmath0  ev .",
    "the pierre auger collaboration reports many results in the field of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) . the energy spectrum with the observation of the rapid flux suppression above 5@xmath210@xmath3 ev @xcite , various studies of expected anisotropy of ultra - high energy events ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) or the estimates of the upper limits on the cosmic - ray photon and the diffuse neutrino fluxes @xcite are among the most important scientific outcomes of this project . in this contribution",
    "we rather focus on the results that are related to particle physics .",
    "namely , we concentrate on the estimation of the proton - air cross - section , the connection between the analysis of chemical composition of cosmic rays ( cr ) and the hadronic interaction models .",
    "we focus also on the muon deficit in current hadronic interaction models .",
    "the number of particles in an extensive air shower ( eas ) as a function of the atmospheric slant depth ( the amount of atmosphere traversed from its upper edge in g / cm@xmath1 ) is called the shower longitudinal profile .",
    "most of the eas energy is released via the electromagnetic sub - shower .",
    "therefore , as in the electromagnetic calorimeter the shower size increases until the average energy of the e@xmath5 in the eas is about the critical energy .",
    "the slant depth at which the longitudinal profile of a shower reaches its maximum is denoted as x@xmath6 and it is one of the primary observables measured by the fluorescence detector .",
    "measurements of x@xmath6 can be used both to get insight into the composition of primary cosmic ray particles ( showers induced by light particles penetrate deeper in the atmosphere than the showers originating from heavier nuclei ) and also to measure the proton - air cross - section .",
    "the differences in x@xmath6 between showers of the same primary energy and same primary particle type are due to fluctuations in hadronic interactions . for purely proton primaries",
    ", the x@xmath6 distribution is a convolution of the fluctuations in the shower development from the point of the first interaction to the shower maximum ( dependent on the hadronic interactions ) and the exponential distribution of the depth of the first interaction . for this reason the fitted slope @xmath7 of the tail of the x@xmath6 distribution is ( inversely ) proportional to the inelastic cross - section of proton - air ( see fig .  [ crossair ] - left ) .",
    "the data were selected in the energy range 10@xmath0 @xmath8 10@xmath9 ev where the proton component is expected to dominate cr chemical composition . to avoid",
    "biases in the measured x@xmath6 distribution fiducial volume cuts based on the shower geometry were applied .",
    "the largest source of systematic uncertainties is the lack of knowledge of the helium component .",
    "uncertainties due to model assumptions were also addressed .",
    "for details see  @xcite .",

    "quantitative estimates of the mass composition of cosmic rays deduced from measured mass sensitive observables can be obtained only when distributions of these quantities are compared to predictions of hadronic interaction models for different primary particle types .",
    "hadronic interaction models , when used to describe uhecr showers , naturally rely on uncertain extrapolations to an order of magnitude larger centre - of - mass energies than are the energies currently achievable at accelerators .",
    "even now when hadronic interaction models are extensively tested and tuned at the lhc it is not obvious at which point the models reliability would be such that they can be universally used to unambiguously interpret uhecr shower data in terms of cr composition .",
    "for this reason the statements concerning the mass composition of cosmic rays have large uncertainties .",
    "the behavior of the x@xmath6 distributions ( e.g. their main characteristics @xmath19 and @xmath20(x@xmath6 ) ) strongly suggests that at energy @xmath21 10@xmath22 ev the mean mass of cr components starts to increase  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ xmax ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is valid whatever model of hadronic interactions is compared to data of the pierre auger observatory . in other words",
    "the only alternative explanation other than a sudden change of chemical composition deduced from the behavior of x@xmath6 is that the hadronic interactions change at that energy and that the important parameters inside the hadronic interaction models ( such as the cross - section ) must behave very differently than expected .",
    "( left ) and @xmath20(x@xmath6 ) ( right ) as a function of energy  @xcite .",
    "measurements are from the hybrid data set . data ( points ) are shown with the predictions for protons and iron nuclei as primary particles for several hadronic interaction models . , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    the problems of the measurement of uhecr chemical composition and studies of hadronic interaction models are thus coupled subjects which shall be addressed at the same time .",
    "the cross - study of both problems using the first two moments of the x@xmath6 distribution ( @xmath23 and @xmath20(x@xmath6 ) ) is presented in @xcite .",
    "the situation gets even more complicated when other observables related to chemical composition are included .",
    "namely , it was shown  @xcite that current models of hadronic interactions predict fewer muons at ground than what is actually observed at the pierre auger observatory .",
    "figure  [ muons ] shows an estimation of the relative number of muons in data normalized to predictions of qgsjetii-03 ( fig .",
    "[ muons ] left ) and qgsjetii-04 ( fig .",
    "[ muons ] right ) for proton primary particles at 10@xmath3  ev . the data are compared to predictions of two post - lhc interaction models qgsjetii-04 and epos - lhc for proton and iron nuclei as primary particles .",
    "the figures summarize the results of independent studies , one done for inclined showers , with zenith angles larger than 62@xmath24  @xcite , and another for showers with zenith smaller than 60@xmath24  @xcite and using two different methods based on the time - structure of the surface detector signals to estimate the muon content of the shower .",
    "the mentioned independent methods together with the analysis of hybrid events  @xcite consistently indicate that the hadronic interaction models predict smaller size of the muon component than what is observed in the data unless pure iron composition is assumed",
    ". such a heavy composition would be in contradiction with the x@xmath6 data when interpreted using the same models .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that shower models do not correctly describe the muonic ground signal .",
