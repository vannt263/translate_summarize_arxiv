    "recently , babar collaboration observed a resonance with the quantum numbers @xmath2 near the threshold in process @xmath3 via initial - state radiation @xcite .",
    "breit - wigner mass is @xmath4 and width is narrow @xmath5 .",
    "the resonance may be interpreted as an @xmath6 analogue of @xmath7 , or as an @xmath8 state that decays predominantly to @xmath9 . in this article , we take the point of view that the state @xmath0 ( thereafter we take the notation @xmath0 ) be a tetraquark state with the quantum numbers @xmath2 , and calculate its mass and decay constant in the framework of the qcd sum rules approach @xcite . in the qcd sum rules , operator product expansion is used to expand the time - ordered currents into a series of quark and gluon condensates which parameterize long distance properties of the qcd vacuum . based on current - hadron duality , we can obtain copious information about the hadronic parameters at phenomenological side .    whether or not there exists a tetraquark configuration @xmath8 which can result in baryonium state is of great importance itself , because it provides a new opportunity for a deeper understanding of low energy qcd .",
    "we explore this possibility , later experimental data can confirm or reject this assumption . interactions of one - gluon exchange and direct instantons lead to significant attractions between the quarks in @xmath10 channel , @xmath7 can be taken as consist of scalar diquark ( @xmath11 ) pairs in relative @xmath12-wave @xcite .",
    "however , two @xmath13 quarks can not cluster together to form a scalar diquark , if @xmath0 is the cousin of @xmath7 , why they have so different substructures ?",
    "existence of the tetraquark states has not been confirmed with experimental data yet , however , there are evidences for those exotic states .",
    "numerous candidates with the same quantum numbers @xmath14 below @xmath15 can not be accommodated in one @xmath16 nonet , some are supposed to be glueballs , molecules and multiquark states @xcite .",
    "there maybe different dynamics that dominate @xmath17 mesons below and above @xmath18 , which results in two scalar nonets below @xmath19 .",
    "attractive interactions of one - gluon exchange favor formation of diquarks in color antitriplet @xmath20 , flavor antitriplet @xmath21 and spin singlet @xmath22 .",
    "strong attractions between the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath25-wave may result in a nonet manifested below @xmath18 , while the conventional @xmath26 @xmath27 nonet would have masses about @xmath28 . furthermore , there are enough candidates for @xmath26 @xmath27 nonet mesons , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "if we take scalar diquarks @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 as basic constituents , the mass formula of @xmath17 nonet mesons below @xmath18 can be naturally explained . comparing with the traditional @xmath37 nonet mesons , the mass spectrum is inverted .",
    "the lightest state is the non - strange isosinglet ( @xmath38 ) , the heaviest are the degenerate isosinglet and isovectors with hidden @xmath39 pairs , while the four strange states lie in between @xcite .",
    "the mass spectrum of the scalar nonet mesons as tetraquark states below @xmath18 has been studied with the qcd sum rules approach @xcite , for more literature on the tetraquark states consist of diquark pairs with the qcd sum rules approach , one can consult e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "the article is arranged as follows : we derive the qcd sum rules for the mass and decay constant of @xmath0 in section 2 ; in section 3 , numerical results and discussions ; section 4 is reserved for conclusion .",
    "in the following , we write down the two - point correlation function @xmath40 in the qcd sum rules approach , @xmath41 where @xmath42 s are gell - mann matrixes for color @xmath43 group , @xmath44 and @xmath45 stand for the polarization vector and decay constant of @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "we take color octet operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 as basic constituents in constructing the vector current @xmath48 .",
    "originally , color octet operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 were used to construct the interpolating currents for the scalar mesons @xmath53 and @xmath54 as tetraquark states @xcite .",
    "there are other two vector current operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 with the same quantum numbers @xmath2 as @xmath0 , @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 are color indexes , @xmath63 is charge conjunction matrix , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are lorentz indexes .",
    "if we take color singlet operators @xmath66 and @xmath67 as basic constituents , and choose the current operator @xmath55 , which can interpolate a tetraquark state , whether compact state or loose deuteron - like @xmath68 bound state , it is difficult to separate the contributions of bound state from scattering @xmath68 state . in this article , we take @xmath0 as a baryonium state and choose the current @xmath1 , although @xmath55 has non - vanishing coupling with @xmath0 . in the diquark - antidiquark model @xcite , @xmath7 is taken as consist of scalar diquark ( @xmath69 ) pairs in relative @xmath12-wave .",
    "one can take @xmath0 as the cousin of @xmath7 , decays @xmath70 and @xmath71 occur with the same mechanism , however , @xmath0 can not be constructed from scalar @xmath72 diquark pairs , because two @xmath13 quarks can not cluster together to form a scalar diquark due to fermi statistics , we have to resort to the constituents , a tensor diquark and a vector diquark in relative @xmath25-wave , to construct the interpolating current , if one insist on that the multiquark current operators should be constructed from diquark pairs @xcite .",
    "it is odd that the cousins have very different substructures , @xmath7 may have structure @xmath73",
    ".    the correlation function @xmath74 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath75 due to lorentz covariance .",
    "the invariant functions @xmath76 and @xmath77 stand for the contributions from the vector and scalar mesons , respectively . in this article , we choose the tensor structure @xmath78 to study the mass of the vector meson .    according to basic assumption of current - hadron duality in the qcd sum rules approach @xcite",
    ", we insert a complete series of intermediate states satisfying unitarity principle with the same quantum numbers as the current operator @xmath1 into the correlation function in eq.(1 ) to obtain the hadronic representation . after isolating the pole term of the lowest state @xmath0",
    ", we obtain the following result : @xmath79 the intermediate states are saturated by the states @xmath80 with the same quantum numbers as @xmath0 , high resonances ( if there are some ) @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 @xmath84 appear consequentially before continuum states ( which can be described by the contributions from asymptotic quarks and gluons ) set on . if we choose standard criterion that the dominating contribution comes from the pole terms , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath84 should be concluded in besides @xmath0 .",
    "it is difficult to analyze those terms qualitatively or quantitatively without experimental data .",
    "we approximate the hadronic spectral density @xmath85 with the corresponding one @xmath86 from perturbative qcd above the threshold @xmath87 .",
    "we will revisit this subject in next section .    in the following",
    ", we briefly outline operator product expansion for the correlation function @xmath88 in perturbative qcd theory .",
    "the calculations are performed at large space - like momentum region @xmath89 , which corresponds to small distance @xmath90 required by validity of operator product expansion approach .",
    "we write down the `` full '' propagator @xmath91 of a massive light quark in the presence of the vacuum condensates firstly @xcite , @xmath92 where @xmath93 , then contract the quark fields in the correlation function @xmath74 with wick theorem , and obtain the result : @xmath94tr\\left [    s_{nm'}(x )   s_{n'm}(-x)\\right ] \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left .",

    "we carry out operator product expansion to the vacuum condensates adding up to dimension-11 . in calculation",
    ", we take assumption of vacuum saturation for high dimension vacuum condensates , they are always factorized to lower condensates with vacuum saturation in the qcd sum rules , factorization works well in large @xmath97 limit . in this article , we take into account the contributions from the quark condensate @xmath98 , mixed condensate @xmath99 , gluon condensates @xmath100 , and neglect the contributions from other high dimension condensates ( for example , @xmath101 ) , which are suppressed by large denominators and would not play significant roles .",
    "once analytical results are obtained , then we can take current - hadron duality below the threshold @xmath87 and perform borel transformation with respect to variable @xmath102 , finally we obtain the following sum rule :    @xmath103    @xmath104    differentiate the above sum rule with respect to variable @xmath105 , then eliminate the quantity @xmath45 , we obtain the qcd sum rule for the mass : @xmath106    it is easy to integrate over the variable @xmath107 , we prefer this formulation for simplicity . from eq.(13 ) , we can obtain the mass @xmath108 , then take @xmath108 as input parameter , we obtain the decay constant @xmath45 from eq.(11 ) with the same values of the vacuum condensates .",
    "the input parameters are taken to be the standard values @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xcite . for the multiquark states ,",

    "the contribution from @xmath115 in eq.(11 ) is less than @xmath116 , and uncertainty is neglected here .",
    "the main contribution in eq.(11 ) comes from the perturbative term , ( a piece of ) standard criterion of the qcd sum rules can be satisfied ; which is in contrast to the ordinary sum rules with the interpolating currents constructed from the multiquark configurations , where the contribution comes from the perturbative term is very small @xcite , the main contributions come from the terms with the quark condensates @xmath117 and @xmath118 , sometimes the mixed condensates @xmath119 and @xmath120 also play important roles @xcite .",
    "the values of the vacuum condensates have been updated with experimental data for @xmath121 decays , the qcd sum rules for the baryon masses and analysis of the charmonium spectrum @xcite .",
    "as the main contribution comes from the perturbative term , uncertainties of the vacuum condensates can only result in very small uncertainty for numerical values of the mass @xmath108 and decay constant @xmath45 , the standard values and updated values of the vacuum condensates can only lead to results of minor difference , we choose the standard values of the vacuum condensates in the calculation .    neglecting the contributions from the vacuum condensates and taking the parameters @xmath122 , @xmath123",
    ", we can obtain the value @xmath124 .",
    "it is indeed the main contribution comes from the perturbative term .",

    "the hadronic spectral densities are experimentally well known , separation between the ground state and excited states is large enough , the `` single - pole + continuum states '' model works well in representing the phenomenological spectral densities . the continuum states can be approximated by the contributions from the asymptotic quarks and gluons , and the single - pole dominance condition can be well satisfied , @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 stand for the contributions from the perturbative and non - perturbative part of the spectral density , respectively . from criterion in eq.(14 ) , we can obtain the maximal value of the borel parameter @xmath132 , exceed this value , single - pole dominance will be spoiled . on the other hand , the borel parameter must be chosen large enough to warrant convergence of operator product expansion and the contributions from the high dimension vacuum condensates , which are known poorly , are of minor importance , the minimal value of the borel parameter @xmath133 can be determined .    for the conventional mesons and baryons ,",
    "the borel window @xmath134 is rather large and reliable qcd sum rules can be obtained .",
    "however , for the multiquark states i.e. tetraquark states , pentaquark states , hexaquark states , etc , the spectral densities @xmath135 with @xmath62 is larger than the ones for the conventional hadrons , integral @xmath136 converges more slowly @xcite . if one do not want to release the criterion in eq.(14 ) , we have to either postpone the threshold parameter @xmath87 to very large value or choose very small value for the borel parameter @xmath132 . with large value for the threshold parameter @xmath87 , for example , @xmath137",
    ", here @xmath138 stands for the ground state , the contributions from high resonance states and continuum states are included in , we can not use single - pole ( or ground state ) approximation for the spectral densities ; on the other hand , with very small value for the borel parameter @xmath132 , operator product expansion is broken down , and the borel window @xmath134 shrinks to zero or negative values .",
    "we should resort to `` multi - pole @xmath139 continuum states '' to approximate the phenomenological spectral densities .",
    "onset of the continuum states is not abrupt , the ground state , the first excited state , the second excited state , etc , the continuum states appear sequentially ; the excited states may be loose bound states and have large widths .",
    "the threshold parameter @xmath87 is postponed to large value , at that energy scale , the spectral densities can be well approximated by the contributions from the asymptotic quarks and gluons , and of minor importance for the sum rules@xcite .    from figs.1 - 2 , we can see that the main contribution comes from the perturbative term , the hadronic spectral density above and below the threshold can be successfully approximated by the perturbative term . if we take typical values for the parameters @xmath122 and @xmath140 , the contributions from continuum states are dominating , @xmath141 it is not an indication that non - existence of the tetraquark states due to lack experimental information about physics above the threshold @xmath87 .",
    "one may refuse the value extracted from continuum dominating qcd sum rules as quantitatively reliable if one insists on that contribution from the pole term should be larger than ( or about ) @xmath142 in conventional qcd sum rules .    in this article , we can not find the conventional borel window ( or the borel window is too small to make robust prediction ) and threshold parameter for the sum rule in eq.(11 ) ; and release standard criterion and prefer more phenomenological analysis .",
