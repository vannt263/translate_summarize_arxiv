    "the sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) is one of the few astronomical spectral regions that has not been fully explored so far . in part , this is because ground - based sub - mm observations are difficult due to the low transparency of the atmosphere . in consequence",
    ", only a small number of bright sources have been observed in a few atmospheric windows ( 350 , 450 , and 850 ) .",
    "the spire fourier transform spectrometer (;",
    "@xcite ) onboard the _ herschel _  space observatory @xcite fills most of this gap covering the spectral range between 450 and 1440ghz ( 210 and 670 ) and provides an important benchmark for high - redshift studies with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "besides the continuum arising from cold dust , in the sub - mm range there are several molecular and atomic spectral lines that probe the different phases of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the  spectral range",
    "the most prominent spectral feature is the co ladder from @xmath0 to 13 .",
    "co is a good tracer of the molecular gas since it is one of the most abundant molecules in the ism .",
    "in particular , these mid-@xmath1 co lines originate in warm molecular gas ( their upper - level energies range from 55 to 500k above the ground state ) that can be excited by ultraviolet ( uv ) photons in photon - dominated regions ( pdrs ; e.g. , @xcite ) , x - rays in x - ray dominated regions ( xdrs ; e.g. , @xcite ) or by shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis of the co spectral line energy distribution ( sled ) , including low- and mid-@xmath1 co transitions , is crucial for understanding the conditions in the cold and warm molecular gas and the dominant heating mechanism in galaxies @xcite .",

    "we processed the raw data with the _ herschel _  interactive pipeline environment software ( hipe ) version 9 @xcite .",
    "we used the standard reduction scripts @xcite .",
    "these scripts process the raw  timelines and produce a flux calibrated spectrum for each bolometer .",
    "briefly , first the bolometer timelines are corrected for instrumental effects and cosmic ray hits , and the interferograms are created .",
    "the baselines are removed and the phase of the interferograms corrected before a fourier transform is applied to obtain the spectra .",
    "these spectra are dominated by the telescope ( and instrument ) thermal emission that must be removed to obtain the source spectrum .",
    "the uncertainty in the telescope emission model used by hipe is 12jy in the continuum level ( spire observer s manual ) , which is comparable to the fluxes of our galaxies .",
    "therefore , the residual telescope emission has to be subtracted before applying the point source correction to the spectra .",
    "the optical angular sizes of our galaxies are several arcmin , but the nuclear far - ir emission appears compact at the angular resolution of spire ( only ugc  05101 and ngc  7130 are almost point - like at the  angular resolution , see figure [ fig : ftsfootprint ] ) . moreover , far - ir emission is detected only in the central bolometer of the  arrays ( fwhm@xmath2718  and 3040  for the ssw and slw arrays , respectively ) .",
    "thus , we estimated the residual telescope emission averaging the spectra of the off - axis bolometers .",
    "for some galaxies , some of the off - axis detectors contain extended galactic emission ( weak continuum and  emission ) .",
    "we excluded those detectors before averaging .",
    "next we applied the point source correctiontaken from the hipe version 9 calibration product ` beamparam_hr_unapod_nominal_20050222 ` .",
    "it provides the point source correction and the beam size as a function of frequency with a 0.3ghz sampling . ]",
    "to the central bolometer spectra to obtain the flux calibrated spectra of the galactic nuclei . to correct for the large beam size variations in the slw spectra we calculated the source - beam coupling factor , @xmath32 .",
    "we define @xmath32 as the ratio between the flux measured with a beam of size @xmath33 and that measured with a 30  beam ( the minimum slw beam size ) .",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , we convolved the 250  spire maps using gaussian profiles to obtain the coupling factor as a function of the beam size , @xmath34 . then with the slw beam size dependence on the frequency@xmath35 , @xmath36",
    ", we obtained @xmath37 and we divided the slw spectra by this function .",
    "the values of @xmath37 for these galaxies vary between 1.0 and 1.4 . by applying this correction",
    "we assume that the spatial distributions of the emission lines in the  spectra are comparable to that of the cold dust traced by the 250  emission .    finally , we scaled the ssw and slw spectra to match the spire photometry ( see section [ ss : photometry ] ) . for the ssw we scaled the spectra to match the 250  ( 1200ghz ) flux measured in a 18  diameter aperture .",
    "similarly , we scaled the slw spectra to match the flux measured in the 350  ( 856ghz ) image in a 30  diameter aperture .",
    "we used the 350  spire image because for most of our sources the continuum at 500  ( 600ghz ) is below the detection limit of the fts data .",
    "point source aperture corrections are applied to the spire photometry ( see section [ ss : photometry ] ) .",
    "the scale factors vary between 0.85 and 1.30 for the ssw spectra and between 0.95 and 1.20 for the slw spectra . for ngc1056 , ngc4051 , ngc4151 , ic  3639 , and ngc7172 the 350  continuum is not detected in the fts spectra . thus for these galaxies",
    "the uncertainty in the absolute flux of the emission lines in the slw range is about 20%  larger .",
    "the final flux calibrated spectra of the galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "we measured the line intensities by fitting a sinc profile to the emission lines . to obtain the local continuum we used a linear fit in a @xmath2710ghz range around the line position .",
    "when two lines were close in frequency ( e.g. , at 807ghz and ) the two lines were fitted simultaneously . in the  spectra of our galaxies we find co lines from @xmath0 to @xmath38 , the , , and  atomic lines , and some water lines .",
    "the hf @xmath10 rotational transition at 1232ghz is detected in two sources and in one source we detect three oh@xmath11 transitions .",

    "consequently , the hf @xmath10 emission in ngc  7130 appears to be related to the agn activity .",
    "we detected ortho- and para - water ( o- and p - h@xmath7o ) transitions in four of our galaxies : two lines in ugc  05101 , one in ngc  3227 , four in ngc  7130 , and one in ngc  7582 ( see table [ tab : lines ] ) .",

    "ir pumping is an efficient mechanism to excite water molecules .",
    "in particular the absorption of far - ir photons at 75.4  leads o - water molecules to the 3@xmath47 energy level @xcite . in ugc  05101 and ngc  7582 ,",

    "we also used a radiative transfer model to interpret the [ ] emission .",
    "the contribution from the warm molecular gas to the [ ] emission seems to be small in these galaxies .",

    "<S> we found that the warm molecular gas traced by the mid-@xmath1 co transitions has similar physical conditions ( @xmath210@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 and @xmath6300800k ) in most of our galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we found that this warm gas is likely producing the mid - ir rotational h@xmath7 emission . </S>",
    "<S> we could not determine the specific heating mechanism of the warm gas , however it is possibly related to the star - formation activity in these galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> our modeling of the [ ] emission suggests that it is produced in cold ( @xmath8k ) and dense ( @xmath9@xmath5 ) molecular gas . </S>",
    "<S> transitions of other molecules are often detected in our  spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the hf @xmath10 transition at 1232ghz is detected in absorption in ugc  05101 and in emission in ngc  7130 . in the latter , near - infrared pumping , chemical pumping , or collisional excitation with electrons </S>",
    "<S> are plausible excitation mechanisms likely related to the agn of this galaxy . in some galaxies few h@xmath7o emission lines </S>",
