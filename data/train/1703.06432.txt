    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) emit radiation over the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum where the x - rays are emitted from the innermost region of the accretion flow .",
    "the x - ray spectra of seyfert  1 galaxies have the following main components : a power - law like primary emission with a high energy cut - off , ` soft x - ray excess ' emission below @xmath3  kev , reflected emission consisting of a fe - k line near 6  kev and a compton hump in the @xmath5  kev energy range .",
    "it is widely accepted that multiple inverse compton scattering of lower energy seed photons is the driving mechanism for the production of the primary x - ray emission ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the seed photons originate from the accretion disc with peak emission at optical / ultraviolet ( uv ) wavebands @xcite . however , the location and geometry of the scattering region is still a matter of debate .",
    "it has been suggested that the scattering region can be a hot corona above the cold disc @xcite , a base of the relativistic jet @xcite or an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; @xcite ) .",
    "the radial extension of the corona is also unresolved : it could be either physically compact @xcite or extended @xcite .",
    "in addition to the primary x - ray continuum , many seyfert  1 galaxies show an excess emission below @xmath3  kev , the origin of which is still controversial .",
    "presently , there are two models that can describe the soft x - ray excess emission  thermal comptonization of the optical / uv seed photons in an optically thick , warm corona @xcite and smeared reflection from a partially ionized accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the reflection features ( fe k@xmath6 line and compton hump ) arise due to the photoelectric absorption followed by the fluorescence line emission below 10  kev and compton scattering dominating above 10  kev in a dense and relatively cold medium like accretion disc or torus . however , the complexity of the broadband agn spectra sometimes results in mean spectral model degeneracy @xcite and to overcome that problem we need to study variability properties of different spectral components .    the x - ray emission from type  1 agn is known to be strongly variable on a wide range of time - scales @xcite .",
    "however , the exact nature of x - ray variability is not clearly understood till date .",
    "the x - ray variability may arise due to the variations in the accretion rate ( e.g. @xcite ) and/or intrinsic luminosity of the x - ray emitting hot corona @xcite . some of the observed variability can also be explained in terms of variations in the source height @xcite or spectral shape @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising techniques that can probe the variable behaviour of spectral components is the root mean square ( rms ) spectrum since it connects the energy spectrum with the variability and has been proven to be very successful in explaining the variability of spectral components in agn ( e.g. mcg6 - 30 - 15 : @xcite , 1h  0707495 : @xcite , rx  j1633.3 + 4719 : @xcite , pg  1211 + 143 : @xcite ) .    in this work",

    "the joint spectral fitting of all four observations ( 2014a , 2014b , 2014c and 2014d ) revealed significant variability in the soft excess , primary power - law flux and photon - index , although there was no noticeable variation in the electron temperature ( @xmath96  kev ) of the optically thick , warm corona .",
    "the fractional variability amplitude in the soft band ( 0.3@xmath22  kev ) is higher than the hard band ( 2@xmath210  kev ) which is indicative of the presence of multiple spectral components varying differently , while for the second observation ( 2014b ) , the variability in these two bands is found to be similar which suggests single component variability during 2014b observation .",
    "ark  120 exhibits more variability when brighter which is consistent with the linear rms - flux relation observed in accreting objects over a wide range in black hole mass .",
    "however , the variability in 2014d was much lesser than other three observations and hence causes slight deviation from the linear relation ( see fig .",
    "[ rms_flux ] ) . 6 .",
    "the soft ( 0.3@xmath21  kev ) and hard ( 1@xmath210  kev ) band count rates are found to be correlated with each other for 2014a , 2014b and 2014c observations . however , for 2014d observation we found moderate anti - correlation between these two bands ( see fig .  [ flux_flux ] ) . 7 .   the fractional rms variability decreases with energy for 2014a and 2014c .",
    "however , the x - ray variability spectra for 2014b and 2014d are found to be inverted - crescent and crescent shaped , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ rms ] ) .",
    "the modelling of the x - ray ( 0.3@xmath210  kev ) variability spectra confirms the presence of variable soft excess and illuminating continuum except for 2014b where only primary continuum is variable ( see table  [ table6 ] ) .",
    "the hardness ratio analysis shows softer - when - brighter behaviour for ark  120 during 2014 observations .",
    "however , we found dual nature of the hardness@xmath2intensity diagram ( hid ) during 2014b observation where the source evolves from harder - when - brighter to softer - when - brighter behaviour at the mean count rate of @xmath67  cts  s@xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ hr_flux ] )",
    ". we will discuss about the 2014b observation in the subsequent paper in detail .",
    "the energy - dependent x - ray variability of ark  120 showed strong modulation during 2014 march as observed in fig .",
    "our spectral and timing analysis of the 2014 _ xmm - newton _ observations of ark  120 suggest that the observed moderate variability is predominantly due to the primary continuum which is variable both in flux and spectral shape .",
    "the variations in the normalization and spectral index of the coronal emission are correlated with each other by @xmath97  per  cent .",
    "the softening of the source with increasing @xmath65  kev x - ray flux is consistent with the radio - quiet agn ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this type of variability is generally attributed to the thermal comptonization where increase in the seed photon flux cools down the corona , resulting in steeper power - law emission .",
    "we also found harder - when - brighter behaviour of ark  120 in the beginning ( first 46  ks ) of the 2014b observation during which the source was in the lowest flux state among all four observations .",
    "such behaviour is generally observed in blazars ( e.g. @xcite ) or in agn with low accretion rate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we computed the unabsorbed flux in the energy range @xmath98  kev using the convolution model cflux in xspec for both the 2014 mean spectrum and the spectrum extracted from the first 46  ks of the 2014b observation .",
    "the estimated relative mass accretion rate of ark  120 during that particular period of time was indeed minimum with @xmath99 while the eddington rate obtained from the combined time - averaged spectrum was @xmath100 .",
    "the soft excess emission from the source is well described by an intrinsic disc comptonization model which requires a warm corona with the electron temperature of @xmath101  kev and the optical depth of @xmath102 .",
    "the x - ray rms variability spectral modelling implies that the observed soft excess variability in the @xmath94  kev band is driven by the luminosity variation of the warm corona .",
    "however , we found no evidence for the soft excess variability in the case of 2014b observation which will be discussed in the subsequent paper .",
    "the soft excess shows correlated flux variability pattern to both the intrinsic power - law and the dereddened optical / uv ( in particular uvw1 ) emissions over the entire @xmath4  days period ( figure  [ flux_obs ] ) .",
    "the nature of the hard band variability in ark  120 is complex ( see fig .",
    "[ rms ] ) and can be explained in terms of the interplay between the primary continuum and reflected emission . in figure",
    "[ pl_xil ] , we have shown the variation of the more ionized reflected flux as a function of the intrinsic continuum flux during the course of the 2014 observation .",
    "the approximately linear correlation between the primary continuum and reflected flux implies that the variation in the ionized reflected emission is driven by the changes in the illuminating flux and variability is intrinsic to the x - ray source .",
    "therefore the complex x - ray variability in ark  120 can be attributed to the x - ray emitting corona with variable intrinsic luminosity . for 2014a and 2014c observations , the fractional rms variability decreases with energy which is most likely due to increasing relative strength of the ionized , constant reflection component .",
    "such small - amplitude , energy dependent hard x - ray variability in ark  120 is consistent with a few other seyfert galaxies ( e.g. ic  4329a : @xcite and ngc  4151 : @xcite ) . in the case of 2014d observation ,",
    "the ionized reflection is not strong enough to smooth out the intrinsic coronal variability and therefore the fractional variability increases with energy in the hard band above @xmath3  kev .",
    "however , the 2014b observation showed complex rms variability pattern which will be discussed in our forthcoming paper .",
    "the uv variability in ark  120 is lower ( a factor of @xmath103 ) compared to the x - ray variability which is expected since the intrinsic uv emissions originate from the outer disc and/or broad - line region ( blr ) @xcite . for ark  120 , @xcite found that the x - rays led uv by @xmath104  days .",
    "the lack of correlation between the uv and x - ray emissions at zero lag ( see fig .",
    "[ xray_w2 ] ) is supported by the existence of a time - delay between these two bands as reported by @xcite .",
    "we found that the uv emission from ark  120 is anti - correlated with the hardness ratio ( see fig .",
    "[ hr_w2 ] ) which implies that the uv seed photons from the outer disc / blr get compton up - scattered in the hot corona and as the seed photon supply to the corona increases , the corona cools down and hence the observed x - ray spectrum becomes steeper .",
    "our results suggest that the observed energy dependent variability of ark  120 is apparently caused by variations in the spectral shape and intrinsic luminosity of the primary x - ray emitting hot corona and the luminosity of the soft excess emitting warm corona .",
