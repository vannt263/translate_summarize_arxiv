    "recent studies have shown that some galaxies which appear morphologically to be spheroids have , nonetheless , substantial ongoing star formation .",

    "we outline the survey and data reduction in section [ sec : obs ]  and present the catalog in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the properies of fuv - detected sources at other wavelengths , the inferred star formation rates , and the implications of the detection of elliptical galaxies . throughout , we assume a @xmath9-dominated flat universe , with @xmath10  km s@xmath11   mpc@xmath11 , @xmath12 .",

    "fuv imaging of the hdf - n was obtained in two hst general observer programs ( no . 7410 with stis and no .",
    "9478 with acs / sbc ) .",
    "the acs survey is composed of fourteen 2-orbit pointings covering 3.77 square arcminutes .",
    "each pointing consisted of 16@xmath16640 seconds exposures with dithers of @xmath1710 pixels .",
    "the field of view of the acs / sbc detector is 34.6@xmath18 .",
    "the images were obtained with the long pass quartz filter ( f150lp ) with an effective wavelength of 1614@xmath19 and @xmath20   .",
    "the stis survey covered 1.02 square arcminutes in six pointings for a combined exposure time of 124,330 seconds .",
    "the field of view of the stis detector is 25@xmath21 .",
    "the images were obtained through the crystal quartz filter ( f25qtz ) with a central wavelength of 1595   and @xmath22   .",
    "both the stis and acs / sbc filters are long - pass filters with a short wavelength cutoff at @xmath23   .",
    "the stis and acs / sbc detectors are both multi - anode microchannel arrays ( mamas ) and have similar spectral response curves which fall off slowly from 1500 to 1800  .",
    "therefore , the combined filter+detector system response curves of the stis and acs / sbc fuv configurations is similar , with the only significant difference being that the acs / sbc throughput is non - zero at 1850   @xmath24   2000   ( figure [ fig : filter_curve ] ) .",
    "data for both surveys were reduced following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "full details of the stis data reduction are given in that paper , and acs - specific reductions are discussed here .",
    "the mama detector has no read noise and is insensitive to cosmic rays .",
    "the primary source of noise is dark current , which has two components .",
    "when the temperature of the mama is below 20c , the dark current is fairly uniform with an average count rate of @xmath25 counts s@xmath11 pixel@xmath11 .",
    "however , as the sbc is being used , the mama warms up and produces an additional temperature - dependent dark `` glow '' near the center of the detector .",
    "therefore , we subtract the dark current in two stages",
    ". first we subtract the primary calibration dark which was made from darks collected at t@xmath2620c .",
    "we then make a residual dark by summing up all of the initial dark subtracted frames and fitting a two dimensional , fifth - order spline curve .",
    "the isophotal segmentation maps from the hdf - north wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) v+i images ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) were used to mask areas contaminated by known objects using the _ blot _ capability of the drizzle package in iraf .",
    "we then subtracted the residual dark after scaling to the average of a region near the peak of the dark `` glow '' .",
    "we find that @xmath27 of the secondary dark remains after this second subtraction .",
    "the dark rate of the secondary `` glow '' near the center of the chip is typically larger than that of the initial ( i.e. , at @xmath28 ) dark rate and is a function of the temperature of the mama tube .",
    "the mama tube gets warmer as the sbc is used , and we find that the count rate increases linearly with time with the rate near the center of the chip increasing by @xmath29 counts@xmath11 s@xmath11 pixel@xmath11 hour@xmath11 ( see figure [ fig : dark_rate ] ) .",
    "equivalently , this amounts to increasing the dark rate by an amount equal to the `` cold '' dark rate every 20 minutes . some of our scheduled visits were longer than 6 hours with entire pointings done at the end of the visit .",
    "therefore the dark rate for these pointings was a factor of 10 - 20 times larger than in those taken at the beginning of a visit , resulting in a decrease in sensitivity of @xmath301 - 2 magnitudes in the `` glow '' regions .",
    "therefore , large sbc programs in the future would greatly benefit from segmenting their observations into multiple visits .",
    "standard calibration files were used for flat fielding , geometric distortion correction and photometric calibration .",
    "individual reduced images were registered and summed using the drizzle package in iraf .",
    "both acs and stis data were drizzled to the pixel scale of the hdf - n wfpc2 data products ( 0.03985@xmath31 pixel@xmath11 ) , and matched to the wfpc2 pixel positions .",
    "shifts between the 16 dithered positions of each pointing were assumed to be exactly as commanded .",
    "this assumption is reasonable , given the small - offset accuracy of hst ( 3 - 5 mas ) .",
    "the registration of the 14 pointings was done by matching the fuv sources to the @xmath32 wfpc2 image and computing shifts , rotation , and scaling with the geomap routine in iraf .",
    "for all 14 pointings , the rms fit was @xmath33 .",
    "as discussed by @xcite  and @xcite , the dark current is the principle source of noise in mama imaging .",
    "the individual frames were weighted by the square of the exposure time , divided by the total dark ( initial + secondary ) . as the dark count scales with exposure time , these weight maps scale linearly with the ratio of exposure time to dark rate . therefore , the final weight maps are the square of the signal - to - noise ratio for objects fainter than the background .",
    "photometry was performed by summing the pixel values within the source areas defined by the 3.25@xmath34 isophotes ( where @xmath34 is the rms background noise ) in the v+i wfpc2 segmentation map produced by sextractor @xcite .",
    "the v+i image was used because it is the most sensitive image , and therefore the 3.25@xmath34 isophotes are contiguous ( i.e. individual galaxies are not broken into several isophotes ) and encompass the large majority of the galactic light for all but the faintest galaxies . to validate this method we extracted fluxes in the @xmath32 image with 3.25@xmath34 and 0.65@xmath34 v+i isophotes .",
    "the fluxes derived with the smaller 3.25@xmath34  isophotes missed 1015%  of the flux within the larger 0.65@xmath34  isophote , but were significantly less noisy .",
    "we therefore use the smaller isophotes for detection and the ratio of the two fluxes ( in the f450w image ) as an aperture correction .",
    "again , we verified that these `` aperture corrected '' uv fluxes agreed well with the fluxes derived in the larger aperture , but with smaller errors .",
    "for the few objects with aperture corrections larger than 40% , the larger apertures were used .",
    "figure [ fig : fuv - mosaic ] shows the fully reduced , registered fuv mosaic .",
    "we detect 128 sources above a signal - to - noise ratio , snr@xmath35 .",
    "we add an additional 7 sources by hand because their uv flux is more compact and the larger v+i segmentation map causes large errors in the flux estimates .",
    "the fuv properties of the 135 sources are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the detection limits vary significantly between pointings due to large variations in dark `` glow '' . in those regions least affected by the dark `` glow '' ,",
    "the 3.5@xmath34 limiting magnitudes are @xmath36 in the stis survey and @xmath37 in the acs survey for a 1@xmath31 diameter aperture",
    ".    published spectroscopic redshifts are available for 60 of the 135 fuv detected sources @xcite .",
    "one spectrum shows the object to be a star . for the remaining objects ,",
    "photometric redshifts have been estimated based on wfpc2 @xmath38 , nicmos @xmath39 , and ground - based @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "there were 12 objects that did not have nicmos identifications because they were either too faint or were incorrectly associated with other galaxies / stars .",
    "two objects have published photometric redshifts at @xmath41 , which would place the fuv filter blueward of the 912@xmath19 break .",
    "one object has @xmath42 so can easily be at @xmath8 .",
    "the second source is at @xmath43 but appears to be coincident with a background object with different optical colors .",
    "figure [ fig : zhist ] show the distribution of redshifts .    in the following analyses ,",
    "we have removed 10 of the 135 sources for various reasons : the object lies on the edge of the uv image ( 4 sources ) , the object lies on the edge of the nicmos image ( 1 source ) , either the nicmos or wfpc2 apertures encompass more than one source and therefore have compromised photometric redshifts ( 3 sources ) , or the object is a star ( 1 ) .",
    "we also exclude an elliptical at @xmath44 from analysis involving fuv to optical colors , because the fuv light is centered on a very small region compared to the very large aperture containing the light in the f300w and other filters ; this difference , combined with the low redshift will result in the f300w being dominated by light from older stars at the red end of the filter .",
    "these objects and their fluxes are included in [ tbl-1 ] with footnotes denoting the object specific problem .",
    "we measure galaxy number - magnitudes for the acs sources and compare them to the published stis counts ( figure [ fig : nc ] ) .",
    "dark current variation complicates the measurement of the counts .",
    "we use the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "first , we use the variance map to determine the area over which each galaxy would have been detected .",
    "the stis and acs counts are generally consistent .",
    "only one object was measured in common .    in the figure",
    ", we also compare the hst number counts to the fuv number counts measured by galex @xcite , xmm @xcite , and foca @xcite .",
    "these other counts reach measurement reached @xmath45 .",
    "we correct the xmm and foca counts from their central wavelength of 2000   to 1500   following xu et al .  by assuming a uv slope , @xmath46 .",
    "we do not include a color correction for the difference between the acs and galex filters , but we estimate that such a correction could be substantial for distant sources ( see figure [ fig : galex_color_corr ] ) .",
    "the difference for @xmath47  is the result of the bluer wavelength coverage of the galex filter , which is more strongly affected by the 912   limit ( see figure [ fig : filter_curve ] ) .",
    "the redshifting of the lyman limit combined with the redder transmission of the acs filter causes it to be sensitive to a larger volume than the galex filter , by a factor of @xmath48% . for @xmath49  sources ,",
    "the color correction is reversed for sources with strong  emission lines falling in the galex filter but below the blue end of the f150lp filter .",
    "about half of the acs sources lie at @xmath47",
    ". the color correction would be less extreme for the stis filter , which had a red - end cutoff between that of galex and acs .",
    "the hst counts are higher ( by a factor of @xmath50 ) than both the galex counts and the model which fits them . at @xmath45 ,",
    "the descrepancy is only marginally significant as the acs counts lie within 1 - 2 @xmath34  of the the galex counts .",
    "the xmm and foca counts are also higher than galex at these magnitudes .",
    "the difference with the model is more significant , as it is repeated over a larger number of bins .",
    "the galex counts are fit by a model which assumes essentially pure luminosity evolution , @xmath51 , and a starburst sed that is flat between 1000 and 1200   @xcite .",
    "the hst counts are significantly higher than the model .",
    "some of this difference is the result of the filter difference discussed above , which causes a @xmath48% difference in the volume surveyed and potentially a half magnitude of color - correction .",
    "thus , there can not be much more than a factor of @xmath50  between the counts and the model .",
    "the most likely explanation for this difference is cosmic variance .",
    "the hst counts are dominated by the very small field of view of the hdf - n , as the stis counts include only a single pointing in the hdf - s and seven in the hdf - n .",
    "the northern sightline is known to have source overdensities at @xmath52  and @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "so , it may not be surprising that the hst counts are higher .",
    "@xcite  estimate that in a typical area the size of the hdf , the cosmic variance of highly clustered sources is a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "we also note that the higher hst counts could indicate that the pure luminosity evolution model is not sufficient at the faintest uv fluxes , and perhaps number density evolution is required as well .",
    "@xcite  report that the fuv number counts measured from the stis subset of the data are surprisingly flat compared to the predicted counts @xcite .",
    "we see no significant change in the slope with the addition of the acs data .",
    "finally , we also examined the hst data to determine whether the difference in spatial resolution between galex and hst could result in source confusion .",
    "there is no evidence of confusion in the hdf at the depth of the @xcite  counts , @xmath54 .",
    "however , at the depth of the galex ultradeep surveys , @xmath55 , some individual sources would be confused .",
    "the 34 sources brighter than 26 in the acs area would correspond to @xmath56  beams per source at the galex resolution .",
    "the detection of hdf - n sources in the fuv provides a sample of starbursts , and other star - forming galaxies , out to redshifts near unity .",
    "we can compare their fuv properties to the extensive data available in the field outside of the hst wavelength range .",
    "strong starbursts should also be mid - infrared ( mir ) bright galaxies .",
    "uv light absorbed by dust is re - radiated in the far - ir ; and heated dust grains themselves , both small grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , emit in the mid - ir .",

    "we find that the average fuv - irac1 color is 2.1 magnitudes .",
    "the hdf fuv image reaches @xmath59 while the irac channel 1 image reaches @xmath60   ( completeness limit due to confusion ) , so uv - luminous objects with typical colors will be more easily detected in the fuv .",
    "the mir luminosity of local galaxies in the iras bright galaxy sample @xcite  has been found to correlate strongly with their far - infrared luminosity which is dominated by large , cool dust grains @xcite .",
    "this correlation has been applied to develop a library of model templates of the mid- and far - infrared sed of galaxies .",
    "the library consists of template seds across a range of luminosities , which can be redshifted to predict the mir flux of a source with given luminosity at a redshift of interest . for each source in the fuv sample ,",
    "we select the template for which the library predicts the closest 24  flux density at the appropriate redshift to apply a bolometric correction ; we do not use the shorter wavelength irac measurements .",
    "the corrections based on the @xcite  and @xcite  template are used to derive an infrared luminosity ( @xmath61  ) .",
    "this technique of deriving the bolometric luminosity from the rest - frame mir luminosity is shown to be accurate to 40%  in the local universe @xcite .",

    "we use the f150lp - f300w color . at @xmath69 ,",

    "the relative distributions of fuv emitting types with redshifts can be seen in figure [ fig : fuv mb ] , which plots the absolute m@xmath88 magnitude as a function of redshift . from this diagram",
    ", there is a broad range of absolute magnitudes for the fuv sources at all redshifts .",
    "the median luminosity for uv - detected spheroids , spirals , and irregulars is @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , respectively , compared to median values of @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94  for all galaxies of the three types at @xmath2  in the hdf .",
    "interestingly , while the median values agree , the most luminous ellipticals in the hdf ( m@xmath95 ) are not generally detected in the fuv ( 3 out of 11 ) .",
    "the figure shows that less than half of peculiar / irregular at @xmath2   are detected in the fuv ; only 38% ( 18/47 ) have fuv detections .",
    "this is due in large part to their intrinsic faintness , rather than unusually red color .",
    "half of the irregulars have v - band magnitudes fainter than 27 , which makes them undetectable in some or all areas of the fuv image .",
    "the fuv - detected irregulars are somewhat bluer than the rest of the uv sample , with a median value of @xmath96  compared to a median color of 1.5 for the entire fuv catalog .",
    "these same objects are optically blue , with a median @xmath97  compared to 0.6 for the all @xmath2  sources in the hdf .",
    "we find evidence for star formation in @xmath98%  of spheroids at @xmath2 .",
    "these objects are typically less massive than @xmath99   ( see figure [ fig : massdisp ] ) and less luminous than @xmath100 .",
    "their sizes ( half light radii ) are similar to other spheroids in the hdf .",
    "we find a median sfr of 0.25 @xmath101  yr@xmath11 , after extinction correction ( see section [ sec : sfr ] ) .",
    "so far , we have only considered morphologically - selected spheroids .",
    "however , few of these objects have the sed of purely old stellar populations , even without including the fuv .",
    "@xcite   show that morphologically- and spectroscopically - identified spheroids in the hdf are not necessarily the same population .",
    "a morphological selection identifies sources which have seds similar to local spheroids and identifies additional sources that are bluer , less massive , and less luminous than those .",
    "only one of the objects in the @xcite  sample of spectroscopic ellipticals is detected in the fuv .",
    "their sample of morphologically selected ellipticals is not identical to that of @xcite , but the fraction of fuv detections is similar .",
    "the fuv detection , then , supports the @xcite  conclusion that some morphological spheroids have recent or ongoing star formation .",
    "this effect has also been seen in the `` blue - core '' ellipticals @xcite .",
    "these objects were initially identified by strong color gradients in the wfpc2 images , which show significant bluing towards the center .",
    "the presence of the blue cores suggested a population of young ( @xmath5gyr ) ellipticals which may have undergone recent merger activity or some type of residual star formation .",
    "ten of the 21 sources at @xmath2  in the menanteau et al .  sample are detected in the fuv . in figure",
    "[ fig : blue - core ] , we show that the sources with the bluest cores are the ones most likely to be detected in the fuv .",
    "the detection of fuv flux near the core of the sources confirms that these objects have small amounts of ongoing star formation .",
    "it is highly unlikely that the fuv flux detected in spheroids is the result of the `` uv upturn '' that arises from a minority population of hot horizontal branch stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , cluster ellipticals at @xmath102  and @xmath103  have been observed to show small amounts of uv emission @xcite . unlike the hdf spheroids , these objects have optical seds broadly consistent with old stellar populations .",
    "the uv emission in uv - upturn galaxies is a small fraction of the total luminosity .",
    "@xcite  find @xmath104  for uv - upturn galaxies , while the median color of the hdf spheroids is @xmath50  mag .",
    "and only one of them has a color greater than 3 .",
    "the differences in the stis and acs filters could account for acs objects being @xmath105   magnitudes brighter than their stis counterparts at @xmath106 , but the hdf spheroids are still significantly brighter in the uv . similarly",
    ", @xcite  estimate that the flux associated with the uv upturn would correspond to @xmath107  if it arose instead from star formation .",
    "the inferred sfr in hdf spheroids is a factor of several higher even without extinction correction , and significantly higher with the correction .",
    "however , we note that an old stellar contamination of the redder filters could result in an overestimate of the sfr .",
    "thus it is likely , though not certain , that most of the uv flux in hdf spheroids is the result of star formation and not the uv upturn .",
    "the more massive and luminous ellipticals in the hdf appear not to be forming stars at rates similar to the smaller and fainter ones that we detect in the fuv .",
    "this could be a direct indication that lower luminosity ellipticals in the field form later than the giant ellipticals .",
    "this is consistent with the widely varying ages measured for local ellipticals @xcite .",
    "such a distinction may be evidence of downsizing in the galaxy formation process , which may be directly related to the rate of merging which is seen to be high for lower luminosity and lower mass galaxies at @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "another way to investigate the star - formation nature of early type galaxies is by examining their location in the concentration - asymmetry diagram for galaxies at @xmath86 ( figure [ fig : cas ] ) .",
    "the most evolved spheroids which have had no star formation in the recent past , should contain a high concentration and a low asymmetry .",
    "these objects typically do not have fuv emission . on the other hand , morphologically - identifiable spheroids with high asymmetries , that indicate a recent evolution , are more likely than not to have fuv emission .",
    "this result supports the conclusion that the fuv emission is originating from star formation , which produces the structural asymmetries .",
    "furthermore , many of the fuv - detected spheroids have relatively low concentrations , consistent with their morphology tracing the regions of young stars as well as the underlying older population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inferred sfr in hdf spheroids is not high enough for them to be the progenitors of local giant ellipticals , but it may suggest that a significant fraction of the stars in lower luminosity and lower mass ellipticals form at @xmath86 . there is no evidence that the fuv detected spheroids are undergoing the last years of a final episode of star formation . instead , we might estimate a duty cycle of star formation episodes . the detection fraction ( @xmath98% )",
    "suggests that these objects could spend as much as half the time producing small amounts of stars . with a median sfr of 0.3",
    ", this duty cycle would allow as much as @xmath108  to form between @xmath66  and @xmath65 .",
    "the median stellar mass estimated by @xcite  for the spheroids is @xmath109  , so they could double or triple in size by present day .",
    "they would still remain much less massive than the spectroscopically - identified ellipticals , which typically have stellar masses greater than @xmath99  @xcite .",
    "we have obtained fuv imaging of the hubble deep field north using the solar blind channel ( sbc ) of the acs and fuv mama of the stis .",
    "we achieve @xmath110  sensitivities fainter than @xmath0 .",
    "we detect 134 galaxies and one star .",
    "we have compared our results to the multiwavelength data available for the field .",
    "we find the following :    \\1 .",
    "the enhanced dark current `` glow '' in the center of the sbc chip is a strong function of detector temperature , which rises sharply during observation visits longer than two orbits .",
    "future large sbc programs would benefit from breaking observations into multiple short visits .",
    "galaxy number - magnitude counts for the full survey generally agree with those previously published for a subset of the data , but are a factor of @xmath50  higher than a model fit to counts measured by galex at the brighter magnitudes .",
    "we attribute the difference to a combination of : a ) differences in the fuv filter transmission between the two observatories , and b ) cosmic variation resulting from the small field of view of the hdf - n .",
    "we see no evidence for source confusion at the level of the current galex counts , @xmath111 , but find that confusion may be an issue in the ultradeep galex survey at @xmath112 .",
    "we detect the optical counterparts ( as identified by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  to six of 13 _ chandra _  sources in the field .",
    "the fuv and x - ray properties of these sources are consistent with star formation rather than active galactic nuclei .",
    "eighteen fuv - detected galaxies are also detected in the goods mips 24  image of the field .",
    "the inferred ratio of infrared to ultraviolet luminosities , @xmath79 , generally follows the relationship with uv - slope , @xmath4 , measured for either starbursts @xcite  or normal galaxies @xcite . using the @xmath113  relation to correct for extinction",
    ", we infer star formation rates of a few tenths of a solar mass per year up to almost 10 , for the entire sample of fuv detected sources .",
    "the median sfr is 0.3  and 75%  of sources have sfr@xmath5  .",
    "rest - frame @xmath114-band morphologies are available in the literature for most of the fuv - detected sources .",
    "half of the fuv - detected sources have spiral morphologies .",
    "we detect only @xmath115%  of galaxies with irregular morphologies , which we attribute to their intrinsic faintness rather than unusually red color .",
    "we find evidence for star formation in @xmath98%  of the morphologically identified , moderate - mass spheroids at @xmath2 .",
    "these sources include the `` blue - core '' ellipticals with the strongest color gradients .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the morphologically - identified spheroids include sources with the sed of local ellipticals and other , bluer galaxies .",
    "the former group are generally not detected by our survey .",
    "thus the sed of the spheroids supports our identification of the fuv flux as arising from ongoing star formation .",
    "the large fraction of fuv - detected spheroids suggests they continue to build stellar mass after @xmath7 , which is supported by their morphological asymmetries .",
    "the small area of the hdf limits the results that can be drawn from the present survey .",
    "we have undertaken a complementary survey to obtain fuv imaging of the hubble ultra deep field @xcite , and results will be presented in a future paper .",
