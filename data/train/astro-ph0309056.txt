    "our observational knowledge of recurrent novae has recently made a significant advancement , particularly led by the most recent detections , and prompt announcements through vsnet , of three recurrent nova outbursts : u sco in 1999 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , ci aql in 2000 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and i m nor in 2002 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical models have been able to reproduce the observed features of the recurrent novae ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "even a prediction of supersoft x - ray phase and turnoff has been made @xcite .",
    "however , the most recent two recurrent novae , ci aql and i m nor , have a significant departure from the classical descriptions of recurrent novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in their classical nova - like light curves and spectra . @xcite even proposed that i m nor and ci aql comprise a new subclass of recurrent novae with massive ejecta and long recurrence times , which may be an indication that these objects are transitional objects between classical novae and recurrent novae . in any case , recurrent novae are now recognized to comprise a more heterogeneous population of novae than was previously thought .",
    "v4444 sgr ( nova sgr 1999 ) was discovered by m. yamamoto @xcite .",
    "the nova nature was confirmed by the presence of strong , broad emission lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the nova declined very rapidly , at a rate corresponding to @xmath1 3.5 d @xcite , which qualifies v4444 sgr to be a very fast nova according to the classification by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported , from spectropolarimetric observations , that the nova showed intrinsic polarization , whose properties were explained by scattering by surrounding small dust grains .",
    "@xcite further suggested that these dust grains may have produced by a previous explosion . @xcite",
    "performed near - infrared spectroscopy , and detected thermal emissions which can be attributed to dust .",
    "@xcite discussed , from the lack of a detectable dust - forming episode in the visual light curve , that the dust is likely to be preexisting . from these observations , @xcite suggested that v4444 sgr may be a recurrent nova .",
    "we recently noticed that v4444 sgr was detected as a transient - type variable star ( ogle ii bul - sc19-v1874 ) during the optical gravitational lensing experiment ii ( ogle ii ; @xcite ) bulge variable star database @xcite .",
    "since this observation covered the important stages of the outburst , we reexamined the outburst light curve using this archival data , and discuss the possibility of a recurrent nova in view of the recent knowledge of recurrent novae .",

    "the magnitudes were determined using the neighboring tycho stars .",

    "the ogle ii psf photometry yielded unsuccessful fitting results on 19 nights between hjd 2451295.682 ( 1999 april 26 ) and hjd 2451342.749 ( 1999 june 13 ) .",
    "this period corresponds to a period when the nova was brighter than @xmath3 = 13 , which must have caused a saturation on ogle ii images .",

    "the overall light curve constructed from the reports to vsnet is presented in figure [ fig : overall ] .",
    "ccd multicolor photometry is shown in figure [ fig : multi ] .",
    "the light curve seems to be composed of a rapidly fading initial stage and a stage of a more gradual decline .",

    "the raw fluxes are shown , which has a large zero - point offset ( approximately @xmath410000 , not corrected here ; the ogle ii unit 1000 approximately corresponds to @xmath0 = 17.2 ) .",
    "there is no indication of a brightening before the outburst .",
    "since the initial detection ( @xmath5 = 8.8 ) by yamamoto was made on hjd 2451294.235 , this observation severely constrains the rise time to be less than 3.3 d. these pre - outburst observations preclude the possibility of a steady rising for @xmath61000 d in v533 her and lv vul @xcite , or a month - long premaximum rise in v1500 cyg @xcite .",
    "we discuss the possibility of a recurrent nova in view of the recent knowledge of recurrent novae .",
    "the spectra of v4444 sgr taken during the outburst @xcite are indistinguishable from those of feii - class classical novae @xcite , and are unlike those of u sco ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such feii - class spectra have historically been recorded only in classical novae .",
    "the recent discoveries of feii - class recurrent novae ( ci aql and i m nor ) , however , makes this distinction less meaningful than in the past .",
    "the light curve bears some resemblance to those of recurrent novae .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : ogle ] , the @xmath0-band light curve shows an almost linear decline between jd 2451350 and jd 2451400 . ) .",
    "this is probably because of the contamination from emission lines and because of the difficulty in visually measuring the faint object @xmath7 14 .",
    "since the @xmath0-band is less affected by strong emission lines , the @xmath0-band light curve provides the best estimate of the continuum variation . ] this stage with a linear decline seems to corresponds to the _ plateau phase _ , which is characteristic to recurrent novae ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "during the plateau phase , continuum emission from the accretion disk significantly contributes to the overall light ( see @xcite ; see also @xcite for a theoretical estimate ) .",
    "the relative increase of the contribution from the continuum may explain the decrease of the @xmath8 color index during this period ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : multi ] ) .    the observed duration of the plateau phase ( @xmath6 50 d ) is longer than @xmath616 d of the u sco outburst in 1999 @xcite and @xmath620 d for the suggested recurrent nova v2487 oph @xcite , but is shorter than @xmath61.41.7 yr of the ci aql outburst in 2000 @xcite.160 d @xcite . ]",
    "after jd 2451400 , the nova started to fade more rapidly , which is consistent with the termination of the plateau phase , rather than a more continuous decrease in the decline rate in most of classical novae ( cf .",
    "the lack of reddening during the fading stage seems to preclude a possibility of a dust - forming episode [ see @xcite for representative color changes ] .",
    "the characteristics of the light curve of v4444 sgr thus resembles those of `` fast '' recurrent novae .",
    "if v4444 sgr indeed turns out to be a recurrent nova , v4444 sgr is expected to have intermediate properties between u sco and ci aql .",
    "( 88mm,60mm)fig6.eps      as shown in figure [ sec : id ] , the progenitor of v4444 sgr was about mag 19 .",
    "if we adopt the maximum @xmath9 of @xmath10 as in the recurrent nova u sco ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the preoutburst @xmath9 is estimated to be @xmath6 @xmath114.5 .",
    "this value is a typical prenova magnitude of a classical nova @xcite , but looks slightly faint for a recurrent nova , since recurrent nova outbursts would require a high accretion rate @xcite . if the maximum @xmath9 is @xmath12 @xcite assuming the relation in classical novae @xcite , the preoutburst magnitude of @xmath13 2 is , alternatively , slightly too bright for a classical nova @xcite .",
    "if v4444 sgr is indeed a recurrent nova , we may need an obscuration by the previously ejected materials , as has been proposed to explain the faint quiescence of u sco @xcite .",
    "considering the likely existence of dust before the outburst , this possibility is not surprisingly unlikely .",
    "it is also known that the recurrent nova i m nor has a faint quiescence @xcite , which can be attributed to the short - period and probably eclipsing nature of this system ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; this possibility would be tested by future observations .",
    "v4444 sgr ( nova sgr 1999 ) has been recently suggested to be a possible recurrent nova based on the detection of the preexisting dust , which may have been formed in a previous outburst .",
    "we examined this possibility using the available outburst observations .",
    "we have newly identified the nova in the ogle ii bulge variable star database .",
    "the ogle ii record covered both preoutburst and late decline phases of this nova .",
    "the outburst light curve showed a plateau phase , particularly in the ogle ii @xmath0-band light curve , which was followed by a more rapid decline .",
    "quasi - simultaneous optical multicolor photometry precludes the possibility of a dust - forming episode as the origin of this fading .",
    "the light curve thus resembled those of `` fast '' recurrent novae and candidates in the presence of the distinct plateau phase .",
    "the outburst spectrum and the preoutburst magnitude more resembled those of classical novae , but they do not exclude the possibility of a recurrent nova . if v4444 sgr is an indeed a recurrent nova , the relatively faint pre - outburst magnitude would require an obscuration by the preexisting dust prior to the 1999 outburst , or the object may be similar to the short - period , probably eclipsing recurrent nova , i m nor .",
