    "quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field manifest themself in a wide variety of fields of physics . for example",
    ", the lamb shift of atomic spectrum and anomalous magnetic moment of the electron were explained with the help of this idea .",
    "most directly , these fluctuations are manifested through the casimir effect . in the late 1940s hendrik casimir predicted @xcite that two macroscopic non - magnetic bodies with no net electric charge ( or charge moments )",
    "can experience an attractive force much stronger than gravity .",
    "the existence of this force is one of the direct macroscopic manifestations of quantum mechanics .",
    "hendrik casimir based his prediction on a simplified model involving two parallel perfectly conducting plates separated by vacuum .",
    "a unified theory of both the van der waals and casimir forces between plane parallel material plates , in thermal equilibrium and separated by a vacuum gap , was developed by lifshitz ( 1955 ) @xcite . to calculate the interaction force lifshitz used rytov s theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field @xcite . at present the interest of casimir forces",
    "is increasing because they dominate the interaction between nanostructures , and are offen responsible for the stiction between moving parts in small devices such as micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems , and can be considered as practical mechanisms for the actuation of such devices . due to this practical interest , and the fast progress in force detection techniques , experimental and theoretical investigations of casimir forces",
    "have experienced an extraordinary `` renaissance '' in the past few years ( see @xcite for a review and the references therein ) .    another manifestation of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field is the non - contact quantum friction between bodies in relative motion .",
    "friction is usually a very complicated process .",
    "the simplest case consists of two flat surfaces , separated by a vacuum gap , sliding relative to each other at @xmath4 k , where the friction is generated by the relative movement of quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "the thermal and quantum fluctuation of the current density in one body induces a current density in other body ; the interaction between these current densities is the origin of the casimir interaction .",
    "when two bodies are in relative motion , the induced current will lag slightly behind the fluctuating current inducing it , and this is the origin of the casimir friction . at present the casimir friction , with its limiting case - quantum friction ,",
    "are actively discussed as one of the possible mechanisms of noncontact friction between bodies in absence of direct mechanical contact between them @xcite .",
    "the casimir friction was studied in the configurations plate - plate @xcite , neutral particle - plate @xcite , and neutral particle - blackbody radiation @xcite . while the predictions of the theory for the casimir forces were verified in many experiments @xcite , the detection of the casimir friction is still challenging problem for experimentalists .",
    "however , the frictional drag between quantum wells @xcite and graphene sheets @xcite , and the current - voltage dependence of nonsuspended graphene on the surface of the polar dielectric sio@xmath5 @xcite , were accurately described using the theory of the casimir friction @xcite . at present the frictional drag experiments @xcite were performed for weak electric field when the induced drift motion of the free carriers is smaller than the threshold velocity for quantum friction .",
    "thus in these experiments the frictional drag is dominated by the contributions from thermal fluctuations .",
    "however , the measurements of the current- voltage dependence @xcite were performed for high electric field , where the drift velocity is above the threshold velocity , and where the frictional drag is dominated by quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "quantum friction is associated with creation of excitations of different kind . for transparent dielectrics such excitations",
    "are photons and quantum friction is associated with quantum vavilov - cherenkov radiation .",
    "thus there is a close connection between quantum friction and the quantum vavilov - cherenkov radiation  both of these phenomena are related to the anomalous doppler effect @xcite .",
    "quantum vavilov - cherenkov radiation was first described by frank @xcite and ginzburg and frank @xcite ( see also @xcite for review of these work ) . if an object has no internal degrees of freedom ( e.g. , a point charge ) , then the energy of the radiation is determined by the change of the kinetic energy of the object . however ,",
    "if an object has internal degrees of freedom ( say , an atom ) , then two types of radiation are possible . if the frequency of the radiation in the _ lab _ reference frame @xmath6 , then in the rest frame of an object , due to the doppler effect , the frequency of the radiation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 . in the normal doppler effect region , when @xmath10 , the radiated energy is determined by the decrease of the internal energy .",
    "for example , for an atom the state may changes from the excited state @xmath11 to the ground state @xmath12 .",
    "the region of the _ anomalous _ doppler effect corresponds to @xmath13 in which case an object becomes excited when it radiates .",
    "for example , an atom could experience the transition from the ground state @xmath12 to the excited state @xmath11 when it radiates .",
    "in such a case energy conservation requires that the energy of the radiation and of the excitation result from a decrease of the kinetic energy of the object .",
    "that is , the self - excitation of a system is accompanied by a slowing down of the motion of the object as a whole .",
    "for a neutral object the interaction of the object with the matter is determined by the fluctuating electromagnetic field due to the quantum fluctuations inside the object .    while a constant translational motion requires for the emission of the radiation at least two bodies in relative motion (",
    "otherwise it is not possible due to lorenz invariance ) , a single accelerated object can radiate and experience friction .",
    "quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are determined by virtual photons that are continuously created and annihilated in the vacuum . using a metal mirror in accelerated motion , with velocities near the light velocity",
    ", virtual photons can be converted into real photons , leading to radiation emitted by the mirror .",
    "this is the dynamic casimir effect @xcite ; which recently was observed in a superconducting waveguide @xcite .",
    "radiation can be also emitted by a rotating object @xcite .",
    "in fact this phenomenon is closely related to the prediction by zeldovich @xcite of an amplification of certain waves during scattering from a rotating body .",
    "rotational quantum friction is strongly enhanced close to a dielectric substrate @xcite    pendry was the first to studied quantum friction in detail @xcite in the non - relativistic and non - retarded limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite pendry applied a new formalism developed for quantum friction to estimate the emission of light occurring during relative sliding of two transparent dielectric plates . to take into account some relativistic effects the reflection amplitudes for the moving surface",
    "was taken as the reflection amplitudes in the rest reference frame for this surface .",
    "the relation between the frequency and the wave - vector , which determine the arguments of these reflection amplitudes were determined in the different reference frame by the lorenz transformation . in ref .",
    "@xcite we developed a fully relativistic theory of quantum friction from which follows that the theory by pendry @xcite is accurate only to order @xmath14 . using a toy model the link between quantum vavilov - cherenkov radiation and quantum friction",
    "was also discussed within framework of a non - relativistic theory in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present article",
    "we use a fully relativistic theory @xcite to study quantum vavilov - cherenkov and quantum friction during shearing of two transparent dielectric plates .",
    "numerical calculations are supplemented by an analytical study close to the threshold @xmath1 and light velocities .",
    "close to the threshold velocity @xmath15 our results agree with the results obtained by pendry . in the ultra relativistic case ( @xmath3 )",
    "there is a dramatic enhancement of the contributions to quantum friction related to radiation of both polarisations , and a new contribution occurs from polarization mixing .    .",

    "thus , body * 2 * can radiate photons while it is excited .",
    "resonance arises when a gain of energy resulting from excitation of body 2 with frequency @xmath36 will create excitation in the body * 1 * with frequency @xmath37 .",

    "are created what give rise to the change of the momentum of each body and friction which we denote as quantum friction due to the quantum origin of involved processes . for materials with losses",
    "also off - resonant processes are possible when an excitation is created in one body and resulting photon is absorbed by other body .",
    "the condition for such off - resonanant process in the non - relativistic case has the form @xmath41 eq.([condition0 ] ) was used by landau for obtaining the critical velocity of a superfluid flowing past a wall @xcite .    for two transparent identical media @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44",
