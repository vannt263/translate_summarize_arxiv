    "demand - side management helps utilities to regulate increasing energy demand by utilizing existing power grid infrastructure .",
    "recent efforts of demand - side management include load - shifting methods , load curtailing methods and energy conservation strategies @xcite . distributed energy resources such as energy storage devices and renewable energy resources provide vast opportunities for demand - side management by storing extra energy generated by renewable resources that can be dispatched to support peak energy demand",
    ".    in general , effectiveness of consumer - driven demand - side management methods depends on active participation of users .",
    "however , in the long run , users may change their participating behavior leading to unexpected outcomes such as lower peak energy reduction and economic benefits .",
    "therefore , designing successful demand - side management approaches have often been challenging with volatile user behavior @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate impacts of realistic energy user behavior , which is not completely rational , on a decentralized energy trading system proposed to regulate electricity demand of a residential community . in the energy trading system , users with photovoltaic ( pv ) energy generation can decide to participate across time to trade energy with a community energy storage ( ces ) device .",
    "first , we elaborate a non - cooperative stackelberg game to study the energy trading between the ces operator and participating users where the ces operator acts as the leader and the users are their followers .",
    "then we develop another non - cooperative game between users to explore their behavior in determining optimal energy trading starting times that minimize personal daily energy costs under two different user - behavioral models : expected utility theory and prospect theory .",
    "the contributions of this work are :    * with time - varying subsets of active participating users that depend on their decisions of participating - time , the energy trading system attains a unique stackelberg equilibrium across time where the ces operator maximizes revenue while users minimize energy costs .",
    "* benefits of the energy trading system are robust to users participating - time strategies that significantly deviate from complete rationality .",
    "game - theoretic demand - side management methods have been widely investigated in literature @xcite .",
    "these studies assume that users act rationally and ideally obeying the strategies predicted by game - theoretic systems .",
    "however , social studies have proved that the rationality assumption of game theory can be violated in real world when users face uncertainty in decision making @xcite .",
    "abundant research using prospect theory has shown how real life user behavior contravenes the conventional game theoretic rationality assumption @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a prospect theoretic study for a load - shifting approach showed that deviations of users decisions to participate from conventional game - theoretic decisions result in significantly different outcomes .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , we apply prospect theory to study users behavior of choosing to participate across time in a stackelberg game - theoretic energy trading system that does not intend to shift regular energy consumption of users . in this regard , we show that the outcomes of the energy trading system are indistinguishable under both prospect theory and expected utility theory , even though users decisions to choose to participate differ between the two models .",
    "the stackelberg game - theoretic energy trading system between a ces device and users in @xcite assumes users participate from the beginning of day and hence the number of users remain consistent over time . here",
    ", we extend the stackelberg energy trading system to study users decisions of selecting energy trading starting times incorporating prospect theory .",

    "we assume that pv power generation and demand forecasts of the following day are available to the users @xmath2 to decide their day - ahead energy trading strategies .",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the pv energy and the regular energy demand of user @xmath11 at time @xmath12 , respectively , then they sell / buy energy amount @xmath13 to / from the ces device at time @xmath14 such that , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the grid energy consumption of the user .",

    "<S> this paper investigates effects of realistic , non - ideal , decisions of energy users as to whether to participate in an energy trading system proposed for demand - side management of a residential community . </S>",
    "<S> the energy trading system adopts a non - cooperative stackelberg game between a community energy storage ( ces ) device and users with rooftop photovoltaic panels where the ces operator is the leader and the users are the followers . </S>",
    "<S> participating users determine their optimal energy trading starting time to minimize their personal daily energy costs while subjectively viewing their opponents actions . following a non - cooperative game , we study the subjective behavior of users when they decide on energy trading starting time using prospect theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that depending on the decisions of participating - time , the proposed energy trading system has a unique stackelberg equilibrium at which the ces operator maximizes their revenue while users minimize their personal energy costs attaining a nash equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results confirm that the benefits of the energy trading system are robust to decisions of participating - time that significantly deviate from complete rationality . </S>"
