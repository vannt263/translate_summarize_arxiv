    "several models of one - dimensional discrete schrdinger operators have been proved to exhibit purely singular continuous spectrum ; see for instance @xcite . in this brief paper",
    ", we consider a particular family of self - similar laplacians @xmath3 on the integer half - line @xmath1 , parametrized by @xmath4 . the parameter @xmath5 plays the role of the transition probability of a symmetrizable random walk . from the physical point of view",
    ", changing @xmath5 corresponds to changing the contrast ratio of the fractal media . from the mathematical point of view",
    ", these laplacians arise from the study of the unit interval endowed with a fractal measure , and was first addressed by the second author in @xcite in the context of spectral zeta functions ; see also the related work @xcite . in this context",
    ", the parameter @xmath5 determines the resistance and measure scaling of the fractal space .",
    "in particular , we obtain a simple one - parameter family of models for which the _ spectral dimension _ @xmath6 of @xmath3 ( see remark  [ re - ds ] ) varies continuously : @xmath7.\\ ] ] it will be explained that when @xmath8 , we recover the classical one - dimensional laplacian with @xmath9 .",
    "we can also take the direct product of any number of these fractal intervals to construct a fractal of a higher dimension .",
    "for instance , a fractal with topological dimension 4 and spectral dimension 2 can be obtained by taking the direct product of 4 one - dimensional intervals , each equipped with a fractal laplacian @xmath3 with @xmath10 , or equivalently , @xmath11 .",
    "the key question addressed in this paper concerns the spectral type of the fractal laplacian @xmath3 .",
    "related questions about wave propagation on this fractal , _ viz . _ the modes of convergence of discrete wave solutions to the fractal wave solution , were studied in @xcite . for recent physics results ,",
    "theoretical and experimental , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "in general , weakly self - similar fractal systems are related to quasicrystals .",
    "although we do not discuss this relation , the reader can find explanations in @xcite and references therein .",
    "our long - term motivation comes from the fact that many problems of fractal nature appear in quantum gravity ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , but the related mathematical physics ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) is not sufficiently developed to approach these problems , mainly because it is hard to tackle problems of fractal geometry and spectral analysis simultaneously . hence analyzing a straightforward fractal model , such as the one described in this paper , may be of special interest .",
    "our result is relatively simple because of the minimality of our model , but it relies upon spectral decimation ( or spectral similarity ) @xcite and its connection with the julia set of a rational function .",
    "parallel ideas have also appeared in the proofs of singularly continuous spectrum for fibonacci hamiltonians on @xmath12 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , as well as the relation between julia sets and jacobi matrices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of most recent articles on this topics , emphasizing the relation between self - similarity and singularly continuous spectrum , is @xcite . we hope that the methods outlined in this paper can be generalized to more complicated settings .",
    "a substantial part of this work was completed and presented at the workshop `` spectral properties of quasicrystals via analysis , dynamics , and geometric measure theory '' at the casa matemtica oaxaca ( cmo ) .",
    "we thank the banff international research station for mathematical innovation and discovery , and the organizers and participants for their support .",
    "we are especially grateful to d. damanik and a. gorodetski for many insightful remarks and suggestions .",
    "the @xmath0-model on @xmath1 is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath13 . for each @xmath14 ,",
    "let @xmath15 be the largest natural number @xmath16 such that @xmath17 divides @xmath18 .",
    "then for all functions @xmath19 on @xmath1 , we set @xmath20 observe that the laplacian @xmath3 generates a nearest neighbor `` @xmath0 random walk '' on @xmath1 as shown in figure [ figrw ] .",
    "random walk . here",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath13 . ]",
    "if @xmath21 , we recover the symmetric simple random walk on the half - line with reflection at the origin , and @xmath22 , the classical one - dimensional laplacian , is self - adjoint on @xmath23 . if @xmath2 , @xmath3 is not self - adjoint on @xmath23 .",
    "that said , we can identify the symmetrizing measure for @xmath3 using the theory of markov chains ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite*ch .",
    "one can readily verify that @xmath3 generates an irreducible markov chain on @xmath1 whose transition probabilities satisfy @xmath24 whenever @xmath25 , _",
    "i.e. , _ it is a birth - and - death chain . as a result",
    ", one can explicitly compute the invariant measure @xmath26 by iteratively solving the equation @xmath27 .",
    "this means that the reversibility condition @xmath28 holds for every @xmath29 , which implies that @xmath3 is symmetric with respect to @xmath26 . in our example",
    ", @xmath26 essentially coincides with a multiple of the discretization of the fractal measure described in @xcite ( @xmath26 is a @xmath30-finite but not finite measure on @xmath1 ) .",
    "moreover , we have the relation @xmath31 which is easy to verify by induction for all @xmath32 .",
    "this last property allows us to transfer our definitions and main results from @xmath23 to @xmath33 in what follows .",
    "our main result is    [ thm : scspec ] if @xmath2 , the laplacian @xmath3 , regarded as an operator on either @xmath23 or @xmath33 , has purely singularly continuous spectrum . the spectrum is the julia set of the polynomial @xmath34 in ( [ eq : specdecdeltap ] ) , which is a topological cantor set of lebesgue measure zero .",
    "it is well - known that the spectrum of @xmath35 , the classical one - dimensional laplacian on @xmath1 , is the interval @xmath36 $ ] , and is absolutely continuous .",
    "so in a sense , there is a `` phase transition '' in the spectral type of @xmath3 as @xmath5 varies through @xmath37 , going from a singular spectrum to an absolutely continuous spectrum and back to a singular spectrum .",
    "we note that , following now standard techniques for the so - called sturmian potentials ( see @xcite ) , one can hope to extend this result to two - sided models on @xmath38 .",
    "however , there is a technical difficulty in the fact that that the density of the symmetrizing measure @xmath39 on @xmath40 with respect to the counting measure is not bounded from above and below .",
    "the disconnectedness of the julia set @xmath41 implies that the laplacian spectrum has infinitely many ( large ) gaps , which is a salient feature of many symmetric finitely ramified fractals @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the summability of fourier series is better on these fractals than that on euclidean space @xcite .",
    "[ re - ds ] the classical notion of spectral dimension @xmath6 is introduced in @xcite for discrete laplacians on infinite graphs , and in @xcite for the corresponding continuous laplacians on compact dirichlet metric spaces .",
    "we note that not all authors agree with this notion of @xmath6 ; see @xcite for a detailed discussion .    in the context of our paper ,",
    "the spectral dimension @xmath6 is understood as follows .",
    "take the sequence of laplacians @xmath3 restricted to the segment @xmath42 \\cap \\mathbb{z}_+$ ] .",
    "one can estimate the lowest non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath3 by the inverse composition powers @xmath43 , which behave , up to a constant , as @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath34 is the spectral decimation function given in , and @xmath45 .",
    "the spectral dimension is then given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 stands for the rate of volume growth between successive fractal approximations . in our case @xmath48 , so we recover .",
    "this method of calculating the spectral dimension of a self - similar laplacian which admits spectral decimation is discussed in @xcite .    alternatively , according to the approach of kigami and lapidus @xcite , under certain assumptions that are satisfied in our case , the spectral dimension of a self - similar set with resistance scaling factors @xmath49 and measure scaling factors @xmath50 is defined as the unique number @xmath6 that satisfies @xmath51 for our fractal laplacian @xmath3 , the resistance scaling factors are @xmath52 and @xmath53 and measure weights are @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( for more details see @xcite ) . from these",
    "it is direct to verify that @xmath6 agrees with .",
    "a more recent work @xcite also discusses the probabilistic meaning of this spectral dimension in terms of heat kernel estimates , but it is not needed for the present paper .",
    "throughout the section , @xmath56 and @xmath57 stands for the resolvent set and the spectrum of an operator @xmath58 , respectively .",
    "we briefly review the necessary ingredients from spectral decimaion that will be used in the proof .",
