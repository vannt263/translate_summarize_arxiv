    "<S> although electrons and photons are intrinsically different , importing useful concepts in optics to electronics performing similar functions has been actively pursued over the last two decades . in particular , collimation of an electron beam is a long - standing goal . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ballistic propagation of an electron beam with virtual no spatial spreading or diffraction , without a waveguide or external magnetic field , can be achieved in graphene under an appropriate class of experimentally feasible one - dimensional external periodic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the novel chiral quasi - one - dimensional metallic state that the charge carriers are in originates from a collapse of the intrinsic helical nature of the charge carriers in graphene owing to the superlattice potential . beyond providing a new way to constructing chiral one - dimensional states in two dimensions </S>",
    "<S> , our findings should be useful in graphene - based electronic devices ( e.g. , for information processing ) utilizing some of the highly developed concepts in optics .    </S>",
    "<S> electronic analogues of many optical behaviors such as focusing  @xcite , collimation  @xcite , and interference  @xcite have been achieved in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , enabling the system as a basic platform to study fundamental problems in quantum mechanics  @xcite as well as quantum information processing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the close relationship between optics and electronics is been made possible due to the ballistic transport properties of a high - mobility 2deg created in semiconductor heterostructures  @xcite . among those electronics - optics analogues , </S>",
    "<S> the collimation or quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) motion of electrons and photons are particularly important not only to achieve electronic quantum devices  @xcite but also to realize ultracompact integrated light circuits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> usually , electrons originated from a point source may be controlled by electrostatics or geometrical constrictions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quasi-1d electronic states and focusing have been achieved in a 2deg with the help of external magnetic fields , e.g. , employing magnetic focusing  @xcite and quantum hall edge states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it would be difficult to integrate them into a single electronic device due to the external high magnetic field apparatus needed . in view of recent successful demonstrations of extreme anisotropic light propagation without diffraction , called supercollimation in photonic crystals  @xcite , an analogue of this effect in two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems </S>",
    "<S> may also be possible . in this work , we demonstrate that graphene  @xcite in an external periodic potentials , or a graphene superlattice , is particularly suitable to realize electron supercollimation in two dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> the isolation of graphene  @xcite , a single layer of carbon atoms in a honeycomb structure composed of two equivalent sublattices , offers a new dimension to study electronics - optics analogues . </S>",
    "<S> carriers in graphene exhibit ballistic transport on the submicron scale at room temperature  @xcite and with mobility up to @xmath0@xmath1v@xmath2s@xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> graphene electronic states have an internal quantum number , a pseudospin , that is not found in normal electronic systems and strongly influences the dynamics of the charge carriers . </S>",
    "<S> the pseudospin is of central importance to many of the novel physical properties of graphene  @xcite , and it also plays a significant role in the present work .        </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy quasiparticles in graphene whose wavevectors are close to the dirac point @xmath4 in the brillouin zone are described by a @xmath5 hamiltonian matrix @xmath6 , where @xmath7  m / s is the band velocity , @xmath8 is the wavevector measured from the @xmath4 point , and @xmath9 s are the pauli matrices . the energy eigenvalues are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the conical conduction ( valence ) band ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . the sublattice degree of freedom of the quasiparticles in graphene can conveniently be described with a pseudospin basis , or spinors , where the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 pseudospin states of @xmath14 represent @xmath15-electron orbital on the _ a _ and _ b _ sublattices of the structure of graphene , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this hamiltonian is very similar to the one used to model neutrinos as massless dirac fermions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding wavefunction is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the angle of the wavevector @xmath8 with respect to the @xmath18-axis . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : solh0 ] ) may be viewed as having the pseudospin vector being parallel and anti - parallel to the wavevector @xmath8 for electronic states in the upper ( @xmath19 ) and the lower ( @xmath20 ) band , respectively ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the spin plays a role in the dynamics of neutrinos , the present pseudospin is similarly important in the quasiparticle dynamics of graphene  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> now , let us consider a 1d external periodic potential @xmath21 applied to graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the potential is taken to vary much more slowly than the carbon - carbon distance so that inter - valley scattering can be neglected  @xcite . under this condition and for low - energy quasiparticle states </S>",
    "<S> whose wavevectors are close to the @xmath4 point , the hamiltonian reads @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath5 identity matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates and eigenenergies of the hamiltonian @xmath24 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : newh ] ) may be obtained numerically in the general case or analytically for small @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that , in a graphene superlattice with a slowly varying 1d periodic potential or a 2d periodic potential of rectangular symmetry , the group velocity of its low - energy charge carriers is renormalized anisotropically  @xcite . unlike bare graphene which has an isotropic ( zero mass ) relativistic energy dispersion ( figs .  1b , 1c and 1d ) , graphene under some specific superlattice potentials displays extremely anisotropic quasiparticle energy dispersion : the group velocity near the dirac point along the direction perpendicular to the periodicity of the potential vanishes while the one parallel to the periodicity direction is intact  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a kronig - penney type of potential with barrier height @xmath25 , lattice period @xmath26 , and barrier width @xmath27 , periodic along the @xmath18 direction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these potential parameters can be tuned so that the group velocity of the quasiparticles ( with wavevector close to the dirac point ) along the @xmath28 direction vanishes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we shall focus on a graphene superlattice under one of these conditions ( @xmath29  ev , @xmath30  nm , and @xmath31  nm ) @xcite . the parameters used here are experimentally feasible as shown in recent studies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , we will relax the special condition to confirm the robustness of the predicted supercollimation .    the quasiparticle energy dispersion of this superlattice ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e , 1f and 1 g ) shows that , not only the group velocity of quasiparticles at the dirac point along the @xmath28 direction vanishes , there is hardly any dispersion along the @xmath32 direction within a good fraction of the supercell brillouin zone ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1f and 1 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this portion of the energy dispersion in this superlattice thus is well described by the relation @xmath33 the deviation of the actual energy dispersion from that of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : e_kx ] ) is less than 5% for @xmath8 vector as large as 40% of the supercell brillouin zone considered ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 1f and 1 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is an equation for wedges . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for some specific superlattice potentials , graphene turns from a zero - gap semiconductor into a quasi-1d metal with a finite and constant density of states about the dirac point energy . </S>",
    "<S> we shall call this class of graphene superlattices as special graphene superlattices ( sgss ) .     and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , in graphene versus @xmath17 and @xmath36 which are the angles between the @xmath18 axis and wavevectors @xmath8 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , respectively . the overlap is shown in a gray scale ( 0 in black and 1 in white ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two states are in the same band ( @xmath39 ) in * a * and are in different bands ( @xmath40 ) in * b*. ( * c * ) and ( * d * ) same quantities as in * a * and * b * for the considered sgs ( @xmath29  ev , @xmath30  nm and @xmath41  5 nm ) . ]    along with the quasiparticle energy dispersion , the internal pseudospin symmetry of the electronic states in sgss also undergoes a dramatic alteration . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate numerically the overlap @xmath42 of two quasiparticle states @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> if there were no external periodic potential , this overlap would be simply @xmath45 as seen from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : solh0 ] ) ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a and 2b ) . the same overlap in the sgs ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c and 2d ) is however dramatically different from that in graphene , and can be well described by @xmath46 this behavior is robust for a wide range of the magnitudes of @xmath8 and @xmath37 , extending over a good fraction of the supercell brillouin zone with a high degree of accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenfunctions of an sgs , for states with small @xmath8 , can be deduced from this result , together with results on the numerically obtained wavefunctions , ( also from analytic calculation : see supporting information ) as having the form of @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a real function . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the spinor in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : solh ] ) is an eigenstate of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the direction of the pseudospin is quantized so that it is either parallel or anti - parallel to the @xmath18 direction , which is the direction of the periodicity of the superlattice potential ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1e ) , and not to the wavevector @xmath8 as is the case in pristine graphene ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the pseudospin in the sgs collapses into a backward ( ` left ' ) or a forward ( ` right ' ) state . the resulting quasi - one - dimensionality in the energy dispersion relation and in the pseudospin of quasiparticles in the sgs </S>",
    "<S> significantly changes the already unique properties of graphene .        </S>",
    "<S> the quasi - one - dimensionality and specific chiral nature of the sgs makes it a natural candidate for electron supercollimation . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed the case that , when a wavepacket of electron is injected into an sgs , the propagating packet exhibits essentially no spatial spreading , i.e. , electron beam supercollimation is realized ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the time - evolution of a gaussian wave packet ( with spatial extent along the @xmath18 and the @xmath28 direction given by @xmath50  nm and @xmath51  nm , respectively ) composed of states in the first band above the dirac point energy with a central wavevector @xmath52 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) . to provide a measure of the electron beam collimation , </S>",
    "<S> we compute the angle @xmath53 in which direction the beam intensity is maximum and the angular spread @xmath54 which gives half the maximum intensity when the angle is at @xmath55 . for a central wavevector </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 parallel to the @xmath18 direction with energy @xmath56  ev , the angular spread @xmath54 in pristine graphene is @xmath57 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) , whereas in the sgs , @xmath58 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) , about 200 times smaller than in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , in the sgs , the spread of the wave packet in the @xmath28 direction after proceeding 0.1  mm along the @xmath18 direction is only @xmath59  nm . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , supercollimation of currents of nanoscale width in the sgs can , in principle , be achieved and maintained as long as the ballistic transport occurs in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> even when the experimental situation deviates from the ideal conditions for sgss , supercollimation persists . </S>",
    "<S> hence the phenomenon is quite robust . </S>",
    "<S> first , for example , if we consider an imperfection in making a superlattice potential such that the periodicity is slightly larger or smaller ( @xmath60% ) , the calculated time - evolution of a gaussian wave packet shows the angular spread @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3c and 3d ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , when considering doped sgss or high energy electron injection such that @xmath63 is doubled , the angular spread is still very small ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3f ) . </S>",
    "<S> third , even when @xmath52 is off from the collimation direction ( @xmath64 ) by @xmath65 , the angular deviation is still negligible ( @xmath66 ) ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3h ) . in graphene , on the other hand , the propagation direction and spread of the wave packet </S>",
    "<S> sensitively depends on the magnitude and the direction of the central wavevector @xmath52 ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> 3e and 3 g ) . </S>",
    "<S> this robustness here is quite contrary to the case in optics where the efficiency of supercollimator , superprism or superlens  @xcite depends sensitively on the magnitude and the direction of the light wavevector and in general provides a very narrow effective bandwidth  @xcite . from our calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we expect that the predicted supercollimation be observable in sgss over a wide operation range .     special graphene superlattice interface and virtual imaging . </S>",
    "<S> ( * a * ) schematic diagram showing the incident , the reflected and the transmitted wave ( the band index is set to @xmath19 ) at a graphene @xmath67 sgs interface , with the relative amplitudes being 1 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thick arrows represent the wavevectors of the corresponding waves . </S>",
    "<S> the incidence and reflection angle is @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> ( * b * ) reflectance @xmath71 versus the incidence angle @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> ( * c * ) schematic diagram showing the propagation of electron waves in graphene @xmath67 sgs @xmath67 graphene geometry . </S>",
    "<S> thickness of each arrow is proportional to the actual intensity of the wave . </S>",
    "<S> a virtual image ( dashed disk ) is formed at a place far from the actual wave source ( solid disk ) . ]    </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we consider the tunneling properties of injected electrons into sgss from pristine graphene , which provides another measure of the efficiency of electronic devices based on sgss . when an electron is injected into an sgs with an incidence angle @xmath70 from the graphene side , the wavevector of incident electron is given by @xmath72 and those of the reflected and transmitted electrons by @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , we have made use of the continuity of the transverse component of the wavevector and conservation of energy , together with the novel dispersion relation given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : e_kx ] ) . using the continuity of the wavefunction in the system described by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : solh0 ] ) and ( [ eq : solh ] ) , we find that the reflectance @xmath71 is @xmath75 interestingly , the reflectance is independent of the specific form of the external periodic potential of the sgs . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( [ eq : r ] ) indicates that the transmittance is large for most incidence angles . </S>",
    "<S> for example , even at @xmath76 , the reflectance is less than 20  % ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4b ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the sgs is not only an excellent electron supercollimator but also a good transmitter in a graphene - sgs - graphene junction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing this property , an immediate application could be made to demonstrate an electronic analogue of virtual imaging in this configuration ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> given the recent rapid progress in graphene superlattices fabrication  @xcite , the manipulation of electrons in ways similar to that of photons in optics by using the supercollimation effect discussed here together with other optics analogues  @xcite is expected to soon be practicable . </S>",
    "<S> the sgss have the promise of playing a unique role in devices based on the synergetic importing of concepts and techniques well developed in optics to electronics </S>",
