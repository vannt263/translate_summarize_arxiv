    "mrk  1388 has an unusual seyfert nucleus that shows the characteristics of both type-1 and type-2 seyfert galaxies ( hereinafter sy1 and sy2 , respectively ) . permitted lines such as the hydrogen balmer emission lines of h and h are narrow ( @xmath7 and @xmath8  km  s@xmath6 , respectively ) with essentially the same widths as forbidden lines at the lower end of the line - width distribution for seyfert galaxies @xcite .",
    "the ratio of an oxygen - forbidden line and the balmer line , [ o]@xmath9/h  @xmath10 , is much more typical of sy2 ( [ o]@xmath9/h  @xmath11 for a sy2s criterion ) .",
    "the iron emission line of fe is very weak , as is typical for sy2s @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite observed a strong featureless continuum ( as for sy1 ) and strong iron - forbidden high - ionization emission lines such as ( [ fe]@xmath12 + [ fe]@xmath13)/[o]@xmath14 , which is higher than typical values for sy1s but lower than the most extreme examples .",
    "mrk  1388 was included by @xcite as a narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1 ) galaxy on the basis of the strong high - ionization emission lines of [ fe]@xmath15 , @xmath16 , and [ fe]@xmath13 , whereas @xcite noted that mrk  1388 may be most simply described as an unusually high - ionization sy2 galaxy . the current classification for nls1 galaxies @xcite requires ( 1 )  narrow permitted lines only slightly broader than forbidden lines , ( 2 )  @xmath17(h@xmath18  km  s@xmath6 , and ( 3 ) [ o]@xmath9/h  @xmath19 ; however , exceptions are allowed if strong [ fe ] and [ fe ] are also present , unlike what is seen in sy2 galaxies .",
    "thus , mrk  1388 lacks the broad - line property to be classified as an nls1 galaxy .",
    "the narrow component pa of the hydrogen paschen emission line is detected in the @xmath20-band in the near infrared ; however , no broad component appears in pa @xcite , which suggests a heavily obscured ( @xmath21  mag ) broad - line region  ( blr ) or a broad - line component intrinsically narrower than those of typical nls1 galaxies because of an intermediate - mass black hole ( @xmath22@xmath23 ) for active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity .",
    "radio observations are not affected by dust extinction toward the nucleus through our line of sight . based on observations by the very large array ( vla ) a - array configuration at 1.49 and 4.86  ghz @xcite , mrk  1388",
    "is an unresolved radio source of nonthermal emission with a power - law spectrum with an index @xmath24 ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the flux density at frequency @xmath27 ) .",
    "the standard infrared / radio ratio @xmath28 @xcite for mrk  1388 is significantly small , which suggests that agn dominates star - forming activity @xcite .",
    "no polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) feature , which also provide excellent diagnostics to distinguish starburst and agn energy sources , is detected for mrk  1388 @xcite ; this is consistent with the low infrared / radio ratio @xmath28 .",
    "the appreciable jet activity is powered by proportionate mass accretion with limits lesser than the order of the eddington luminosity , which is proportional to the black hole mass .",
    "thus , radio jet clues to the mass of the central black hole .",
    "the properties of the bulge component correlate with the mass of the central black hole @xcite , although they do not correlate with a pseudobulge or galaxy - disk component @xcite .",
    "mrk  1388 was described as `` very compact '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered this galaxy and described it as spherical , with diffuse edges , and apparently with a star - like nucleus .",
    "however , its morphology is actually slightly elongated , and thus is elliptical rather than spherical @xcite .",
    "the hubble type is `` e ? '' in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ; the @xmath29-mag / arcsec@xmath30 radius is only @xmath31  kilo - parsecs  ( kpc ) .",
    "mrk  1388 is an isolated galaxy with almost no asymmetry or distortion @xcite , suggestive of long since a last merging event .",
    "thus , the host of mrk  1388 may be a small and isolated elliptical galaxy .",
    "this peculiar galaxy may provide important clues for extreme - parameter regions connecting bulges and central black holes in the scenario of coevolution .",
    "the present paper discusses the mass of the central black hole in mrk  1388 based on very - high - angular - resolution radio and optical studies that used the very - long - baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) technique and the hubble space telescope  ( hst ) , respectively . in section  [ section : dataanddataanalysis ] , we describe our vlbi observation and data reduction and analysis of an hst image .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ section : result ] , and their implications are discussed in section  [ section : discussion ] . throughout this paper , we use lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath32cdm ) cosmology with @xmath33  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . the redshift is @xmath36  ( sloan digital sky survey data release  7 ) ; the luminosity distance is @xmath37  mpc , and the angular - size distance is @xmath38  mpc ; 1  milliarcsecond  ( mas ) corresponds to a projected linear scale of @xmath39  pc at the distance to mrk  1388 .",
    "we observed mrk  1388 on may  9 , 2005 in the @xmath40-band using ten antennas of the very long baseline array  ( vlba ) at the national radio astronomy observatory  ( nrao ) .",
    "the data were obtained with observation code bd106 , in which seven objects of nearby radio - quiet nls1 galaxies were also observed .",
    "the results of these observations were previously published @xcite .",
    "a left - circular polarization was received at a center frequency of @xmath41  ghz with a total bandwidth of @xmath42  mhz . because mrk  1388 is a faint radio source",
    ", we observed in phase - referencing mode , which allowed us to derive calibration parameters for instrumental and atmospheric effects from observations of the nearby strong compact radio source ( `` calibrator '' ) @xcite j1455 + 2131 separated by @xmath43 from the target .",
    "the period of the antenna nodding cycle was @xmath44  min , and the total on - source time was approximately @xmath45  min for the target .",
    "standard calibration procedures for vlba phase referencing were applied during data reduction using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ; @xcite ) software , developed by the nrao .",
    "the details of data reduction are the same as for @xcite .",
    "we set the phase - tracking center for mrk  1388 to the position determined using the vla a - array at @xmath44  ghz with an accuracy of approximately @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "an emission was initially found at a position offset by less than several tens of mas . after shifting the mapping center , we deconvolved the images using the task imagr ( clean ) , and we measured the astrometric positions of the emission using the task jmfit .",
    "subsequently , we self - calibrated in phase with a threshold signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath47 using the task calib . we smoothed and interpolated the solutions before applying to the data .",
    "the deconvolution and self - calibration algorithms were interactively applied several times .",
    "we used the difmap software @xcite to make the final image using the clean algorithm from the calibrated visibilities . to retrieve both compact and",
    "diffuse components to the extent possible , we used step - by - step uniform , natural , and ( @xmath48 ,  @xmath49)-tapered weighting functions for clean .",
    "the final vlba image is shown in figure  [ figure : vlba ] .",
    "image parameters are listed in table  [ table : vlba ] .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey ( ass ; @xmath54@xmath55  kev ) detected x - rays from mrk  1388 with an intrinsic luminosity @xmath56@xmath57  ergs  s@xmath6 and a photon index @xmath58 with an absorption column density @xmath59  @xmath60 , assuming @xmath61  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "we convert their result into the @xmath62-corrected 210  kev luminosity @xmath63  ergs  s@xmath6 .",
    "however , we must verify the poor statistics of the photon index @xmath64 ( i.e. , the absorption column density @xmath65 ) .",
    "the rosat ass faint source catalog @xcite provides the hardness ratios @xmath66 ( corresponding to @xmath67 at @xmath54@xmath68  kev ) and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 at @xmath71@xmath68  kev ) , which suggest a significant @xmath65 with a negligible thermal component .",
    "the negative detection of the broad component of pa @xcite indicates @xmath21  mag , which is equivalent to @xmath72  @xmath60 if we simply adopt the galactic ratio @xmath73  @xmath60  mag@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the rosat ass luminosity presented above must be an underestimate , and should give a lower limit for the intrinsic x - ray luminosity .",
    "on the other hand , the negative detection with the rxte xss of @xmath74  ergs  @xmath60  s@xmath6 at a hard x - ray regime of 320  kev @xcite suggests @xmath75@xmath76  ergs  s@xmath6 . by combining them , we obtain @xmath7710  @xmath78  ergs  s@xmath6 as the possible range of x - ray luminosity",
    ".    the absorption should be at most @xmath79  @xmath60 , unless the rosat band ( @xmath54@xmath55  kev ) is almost perfectly absorbed .",
    "thus , a plausible value is @xmath80  @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the ratio @xmath75@xmath81  kev@xmath82)$ ] @xcite also indicates that @xmath65 is not so large to be compton - thick for mrk  1388 as follows . using the intrinsic balmer decrement @xmath83 , the observed values @xmath84 and @xmath85  ergs  s@xmath6  @xmath60 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively @xcite , give @xmath88  mag for the region of narrow - line components . according to an observed [ o ] flux @xcite and an extinction correction at @xmath9",
    ", we obtain @xmath89@xmath81  kev@xmath82)]=1.4 $ ] , which is similar to typical values for sy1 ( @xmath90@xmath91 ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , given range @xmath80",
    "@xmath60 of moderate absorption column density , the range of x - ray luminosity @xmath75@xmath92  ergs  s@xmath6 inferred from the soft x - ray regime and the range @xmath75@xmath93  ergs  s@xmath6 inferred from the hard x - ray regime are not so unreliable .    according to the fundamental plane ,",
    "the @xmath91@xmath81  kev luminosity range and the 5-ghz luminosity @xmath94  ergs  s@xmath6 from our vlbi observation ( table  [ table : vlba ] ) impose a black hole mass of @xmath95 .",
    "this result includes the boundary between the intermediate - mass and the supermassive black hole near the lower end of the agn mass function @xcite .",
    "alternatively , based on our hst image analysis ( section  [ section : hstdata ] ) , we also estimate the black hole mass using the relationship between the black hole mass and the s@xmath0rsic index @xmath96 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the s@xmath0rsic index of the major component in mrk  1388 is @xmath97 .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath98 ^ 2 $ ] with a total absolute scatter of @xmath99  dex from @xmath100  galaxies ; this empirical relationship predicts a black hole mass @xmath101 for mrk  1388 , which is consistent with the value derived based on the fundamental plane discussed above .",
    "the third method we use is the improved version of the relationship between the black hole mass and the bulge luminosity @xcite ; namely , @xmath102 with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath103 , where the @xmath104-band luminosity in solar - luminosity units is @xmath105 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath104-band absolute magnitude @xmath106 for the major s@xmath0rsic component with @xmath97 is @xmath107  mag , which is derived based on the sdss @xmath108@xmath109 spectral index , @xmath110-correction , and galactic extinction . as a result",
    ", this @xmath111@xmath40 relationship suggests a black hole mass @xmath112 for mrk  1388 .",
    "this value is also consistent with those derived from the fundamental plane and the @xmath113@xmath96 relationship discussed above .",
    "thus , all three methods provide similar estimates for the black hole mass ; namely , @xmath1@xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "these values are in a preferential range for typical nls1 galaxies rather than for intermediate mass black holes .",
    "the detection of @xmath114@xmath115  km  s@xmath6 was expected from the empirical relationship between @xmath116 and @xmath75@xmath81  kev ) @xcite , where @xmath116 is the radius of blr , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 @xcite , where @xmath49 is the effective velocity of blr clouds and @xmath119 is the gravitational constant .",
    "however , no broad - line component has yet been detected in h , h , or pa ( section  [ section : introduction ] ) .",
    "thus , the hidden blr is a promising idea .",
    "the picture of a heavily absorbed nls1 nucleus can potentially explain the peculiarities previously observed ( i.e. , the negative detections of broad - line components in h , h , or pa even with a respectable x - ray luminosity from an agn and the strong high - ionization emission lines are observed ) , based on our radio observation and the analysis of galactic surface brightness , which are essentially not affected by dust extinction toward the nucleus .",
    "the previous discovery of a hidden nls1 galaxy in ngc  5506 is because of the detection of broad components ( pa , o@xmath1201.1287  @xmath121 m , etc . ) in the near - infrared regime @xcite . because of a weaker extinction constraint ( @xmath122 ) , the ngc  5506 nucleus may be less obscured than mrk  1388 .",
    "ngc  5506 also shows other properties similar to mrk  1388 : [ o]@xmath9/h  @xmath123 , which is in the range of sy2 galaxies , detection by vlbi with a high brightness temperature of @xmath124  k @xcite , and a moderate column density @xmath125  @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "these sources suggest that obscured nls1 galaxies might be hidden as a class in the range of the lowest - end of the agn mass function or intermediate mass black holes .",
    "a hard - x - ray imager with high sensitivity would discover numerous x - ray sources with rapid variations at the centers of pseudobulges .",
