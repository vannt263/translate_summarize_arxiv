    "all main - sequence stars born with masses below @xmath0 8 @xmath1 have or will go through the evolutionary phase called asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . the lower limit in initial mass",
    "is set by the age of the galactic disc , the upper limit is set by the mass where carbon can be ignited in the stellar core ( but see the presentation by siess on super - agb stars in this volume ) .",
    "the agb is the final phase where intermediate - mass stars have nuclear burning in the form of alternate hydrogen and helium shell burning , before they cross the herzsprung - russell diagram to become planetary nebulae and then white dwarfs .",
    "a summary of the interior structure and stellar evolution up to and on the agb , and including the post - agb phase , can be found in the recent textbook `` asymptotic giant branch stars ''",
    "( habing & olofsson 2004 ) .",
    "agb stars are luminous ( [ @xmath20.1  a few ] 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ) and cool , with effective temperatures in the range 3850 to @xmath22500 k ( for m0 to m10 giants , e.g. fluks et al .",
    "1994 ) . from this",
    "it follows that agb stars are big ( up to a few hundred @xmath5 ) , and combining this with the classical pulsation equation @xmath6 it follows that any fundamental mode radial pulsations that would occur would have periods between tens and hundreds of days .",
    "equally important , and typical for the agb , are the chemical peculiarities that occur during this evolutionary phase ( see chapter 2 in the aforementioned book ) .",
    "depending in a complex way on initial mass , metallicity , mass - loss , mixing and burning in the envelope [ hot bottom - burning ] , an agb star may go through several third dredge - up events whereby mainly carbon , nitrogen , oxygen and @xmath7-process elements are mixed ultimately into the stellar photosphere .",
    "depending on the c / o - ratio different molecules form in the cool atmospheres ( vo , tio , c@xmath8 , cn ) and a star can be classified as m - star ( c / o @xmath0 0.95 ) , s - star ( 0.95 @xmath0 c / o @xmath9 1.0 ) or c - star ( c / o @xmath10 1.0 ) .",
    "intermediate classes ( ms , sc ) also exist .",
    "the low effective temperatures already make agb stars redder than all their main - sequence progenitors .",
    "in addition , the formation of different molecules depending on chemical type makes that the infrared colours of m- and c - stars are different , as will be discussed later .",
    "furthermore , for spectral types later than @xmath2m4-m5 ( e.g. glass & schultheis 2002 ) the region close to the star has the right combination of temperature and density for dust grains to form .",
    "dust absorbs efficiently in the optical and radiates in the infra - red .",
    "this implies that agb stars surrounded by dust shells are even redder .    in the present review",
    "i will only discuss the most recent results .",
    "for earlier reviews covering agb stars in local group ( lg ) galaxies see , azzopardi ( 1999 ) , and groenewegen ( 1999 , 2002 , 2006a , b ) .",
    "as agb stars are cool and many lose mass , infra - red colours are a natural way to search for them .",
    "a disadvantage is that only candidates may be identified , although the @xmath11 colour is often used to discriminate m and c - stars ( see the discussion later ) .",
    "an advantage is that very red colours trace a different population of extreme mass loss and likely of higher initial mass , or stars at the very end of the agb .    as the 2mass @xmath12 survey ( cutri et al . 2003 ) was an all - sky survey that went reasonably deep ( @xmath13 ) , it had the potential of discovering agb stars in nearby lg galaxies .",
    "quite a few studies have appeared that used 2mass data : demers et al .",
    "( 2002 ) correlated spectroscopically confirmed c - stars in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) with 2mass and used this to propose 26 c - star candidates in the fornax dsph .",
    "cioni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) studied the spatial c / m ratio over the mcs ( also using denis data ) to infer the distribution in [ fe / h ] .",
    "tsalmantza et al .",
    "( 2006 ) used virtual observatory tools to identify luminous ( @xmath14 ) agb stars with @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the mcs , m31 and m33 .",
    "groenewegen ( 2006a ) selected 2mass sources in lg galaxies within 1 mpc ( but excluding mcs , m31 , m32 , m33 ) , and retaining objects with @xmath17 , appropriate @xmath18-range for agb stars , errors in @xmath19 and excluding known objects using the simbad database .    in the last couple of years",
    "more studies appeared that used ground - based ir instrumentation sometimes combined with an optical colour .",
    "cioni & habing ( 2005a ) studied a field in draco of 40  x30  in @xmath20 , and cioni & habing ( 2005b ) studied a field in ngc 6822 of 20  x20  in @xmath20 . at this conference",
    "she also presented preliminary results on m33 . in her papers",
    "she selects o - rich and c - rich agb stars from their infrared colours and then studies the spatially resolved c / m ratio .",
    "kang et al . ( 2006 ) studied a smaller field of 6.3  x 3.6  in @xmath21 in ngc 6822 . since this galaxy was observed using the narrow - band filter technique ( see later ) by letarte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) they could identify known carbon stars in various colour - colour diagrams . the m31 companions ngc 147 , 185 , 205 have been studied by davidge ( 2005 ) , kang et al .",

    "spitzer space telescope _ has a great discovery potential for luminous and especially mass - losing agb stars in lg galaxies .",
    "first results have been published from the s@xmath22mc survey of the smc ( bolatto et al .",

    "r.  gehrz , program i d 128 ) and mips ( p.i .",
    "e  skillman , program i d 20425 ) .",
    "first results on irac observations of wlm were presented by dale jackson et al . at this conference .",
    "as wlm has been surveyed using the narrow - band filter system ( battinelli & demers 2004 ) they could compare the number of detections .",
    "interestingly , they recovered 90% of the known c - stars in the irac colours , but this represented only of order 20% of the entire agb population . especially stars with @xmath23 { \\raisebox{-1.1mm}{$\\stackrel{>}{\\sim}$}}0.3 $ ]",
    "were lacking among the known c - stars ( and one would expect them to be c - stars at the low metallicity of wlm ) .    to aid in identifying agb stars in the non - standard irac and mips filters ,",
    "groenewegen ( 2006c ) has presented tracks for agb stars in various optical , near- and mid - infrared colours as a function of mass loss rate and for both o- and c - stars .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ groen - wlm ] .",
    "note that the fluxes and mass loss rates listed in that paper are for a particular luminosity and distance , and scaling relations need to be applied ( as explained in the paper ) to compute fluxes and mass loss rates for other values of luminosity and distance !",
    "variability is another main characteristic of agb stars .",
    "mira variables have peak - to - peak amplitudes of larger than 2.5 , 0.9 , and 0.4 mag in @xmath24 , respectively , and are therefore easy to find .",
    "the disadvantage is that pulsation amplitude and period are not sufficient to discriminate o - rich from c - rich objects , and that the observations are ( observing ) time demanding .",
    "an advantage is that miras follow a tight period - luminosity relation and hence ( relative ) distances can be derived .",
    "the bars of the smc and lmc have been surveyed with the ogle and macho surveys , and the resulting databases have been extensively data mined for red variables , since the pioneering work by wood ( 1999 ) . by selecting on pulsation amplitude different sequences are populated , as illustrated in figure  [ groen - pl - mc ] , with the largest amplitude mira variables belonging to sequence `` c '' . for a summary of the results of the micro lensing surveys on red variables in the mcs ,",

    "the @xmath25 colours and @xmath26 magnitudes suggest that the majority are lpvs .",

    "fliri et al .",
    "( 2006 ) present results from the wecapp micro lensing survey . a field of 16x 16  was monitored in @xmath26 and @xmath27 over 3 years with 200 - 400 epochs .",

    "single - epoch @xmath12 photometry was also carried out , and astrometry and 4-band photometry is presented for 1915 lpvs . using the period derived from the @xmath27-band monitoring and the single - epoch",
    "@xmath28-band they present a period - luminosity relation .",
    "naturally there is quite some scatter , but more than one would expect even from single - epoch data .",
    "some of the stars that are significantly brighter than the lmc @xmath29-relations shifted to the distance of m31 can be identified with supergiants ( as they seem associated with the ring of star formation in m31 ) , but there are also objects at periods longer than 600 days that are 2 mag fainter than the @xmath29-relation .",
    "this technique uses the specific spectral characteristic of late - type stars , where strong molecular tio bands develop in m - stars , and c@xmath8 and cn bands in c - stars .",

    "[ groen - lf1 ]    [ groen - lf2 ]    the fact that lg galaxies are increasingly surveyed in the infrared as well , allows one to compare the selection of m- and c - stars using infrared data with that using the narrow - band filter system .",

    "( 2006 ) has done this for ngc 6822 .",

    "these results indicate that a slightly more `` purer '' sample of infrared selected c - stars might have been obtained by selecting slightly redder objects .",
    "it is not clear if this means redder in @xmath40 than 1.36 or if the foreground extinction , which is substantial with @xmath41 = 0.8 , was slightly underestimated .",
    "it is not discussed in demers et al .",
    "( 2006 ) if increasing the lower limit for m - star selection would remove the bluer stars in @xmath38 .",
    "the current selection criterion implies an oxygen - rich sample that is roughly 10% contaminated by c - stars , and with 20% stars that are bluer than used to define m - stars in the narrow - band surveys .    a different view on the same topic is the following .",
    "letarte et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identify 904 c - stars and derive a c / m ratio of 1.0 @xmath42 0.2 in a 28  @xmath43 42  centred on ngc 6822 .",
    "cioni & habing ( 2005b ) observed a 20  @xmath43 20  area in @xmath20 . selecting stars above the trgb and using 1.36 as the division between c- and o - stars in @xmath11 , they find 1511 c - stars and a c / m ratio of 0.32 .",
    "kang et al . ( 2006 ) observed a 6.3  @xmath43 3.6  field .",
    "they use the criterion @xmath44 and @xmath45 to select 141 c - stars and derive a c / m ratio of 0.27 .",
    "their selection criterion is based on the nir colours of the known c - stars from letarte et al .",
    "the fact that kang et al .",
    "assume a redder limit for the selection of c - stars probably explains why they have relatively fewer c - stars compared to cioni & habing ; 141 @xmath43 ( 20 @xmath43 20 ) / ( 6.3 @xmath43 3.6 ) is about 2500 while cioni & habing have 1511 c - stars ( the density of c - stars is not uniform as well ) .",
    "as the c / m ratio is very similar , their selection based on @xmath11 and @xmath46 must also have led to fewer m - stars than in cioni & habing .    the large discrepancy in c / m ratio between the infrared works and the narrow - band work is likely due to a larger number of `` m - stars '' in the infrared works . as already mentioned earlier in discussing the results by demers et al .",
    ", even selecting m - stars as having @xmath47 results in more m - stars that found by the narrow - band surveys . * no * lower limit on the selection of m - stars in @xmath11 , as appears to be the case in kang et al . and cioni & habing ( the bluest stars included have @xmath48 ) ,",
    "will therefore lead to too many `` m - stars '' and hence to a lower c / m ratio .",
    "the narrow band surveys of the lg are fairly complete .",
    "notable exceptions are fornax dsph@xmath49 ( at 140 pc distance ) , lgs3 ( 620 pc ) , leo a@xmath49 ( 800 pc ) , sextans b@xmath49 ( 1320 pc ) , sextans a@xmath49 ( 1440 pc ) , ic 5152 ( 1700 pc ) , gr 8 ( 2200 pc ) . it might also be worthwhile to re - do ngc 55@xmath49 ( 2200 pc ) , ngc 300@xmath49 ( 2200 pc ) , ngc 2403@xmath49 ( 3600 pc ) , for which incomplete data from the 1980 s exist .",
    "a search for agb stars would certainly be successful as pne are known to exist in almost all of these galaxies ( those marked by a @xmath49 ) .",
    "crowding may be an issue from the central parts of the most distant galaxies ( see e.g. ddo 190 at 2.8 mpc ) , but is not an issue in e.g. ngc 3109 at 1.3 mpc .",
    "the largest telescopes which currently have the cn , tio narrow - band filter system installed are soar ( 4.1 m , 5.2  fov ) , cfht ( 3.6 m , 42@xmath50 x 28@xmath50 fov ) , wiyn ( 3.5 m , 9.6@xmath50 fov ) and the tng ( 3.5 m , 9.4@xmath50 fov ) .",

    "we may need to revise our understanding of mass loss at low metallicity if the presence of obscured agb stars is more widespread that we now believe .",
    "related to this , an increasing number of lg galaxies is being observed in the near - infrared .",
    "simple infrared criteria have been used to separate c- from m - stars but a comparison to the results obtained using the narrow - band filter system suggests that the infrared criteria need refinement as they lead to the selection of too many c , and way too many oxygen - rich stars that are earlier than spectral type m ( as defined by the narrow - band surveys ) .",
    "additional information that might be used in classification is variability .",
    "projects like super - macho , ogle - iii continue to observe the mc and galactic bulge region . some work on lg galaxies is being carried out using the sirius camera on the irsf in south - africa .",
