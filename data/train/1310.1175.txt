    "the rate of mass ejection ( @xmath362 ) can be estimated from this radius as follows . from the continuity equation for the distribution of ejecta around the wd , @xmath363 , where @xmath362 is a rate of mass ejection from the wd and constant in the radial distance ( @xmath364 ) , and @xmath365 is mass density , the number density of protons",
    "is written by @xmath366 the optical depth condition is written by @xmath367 here , @xmath368 for large ` abund ` of neon .",
    "therefore , @xmath362 is obtained to be @xmath369    on the other hand , the reaction rate of mass producing nuclear energy ( @xmath370 ) is related to the observed luminosity ( @xmath371 ) by @xmath372 , where @xmath373 and @xmath374 erg s@xmath5 ( table  [ table : maxi spectrum ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath375",
    "g s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the relation @xmath376 is obtained , which means that energy produced by the tnr at the bottom of accreted layer can escape as an x - ray photons efficiently with very small mass ejection , despite the super - eddington luminosity .",
    "thus , there must be some sort of mechanism to realize the super - eddington luminosity with a small mass ejection .",
    "we infer a convection just after the tnr @xcite for that mechanism , then we expect that future theoretical works of the tnr process , applied to the mass range near or over the chandrasekhar limit , will clarify this mechanism .",
    "we also suspect that photon bubbles in highly magnetized atmospheres @xcite may work to solve this problem . according to @xcite , to produce the @xmath8 eddington luminosity with small mass ejection",
    ", the magnetic pressure @xmath377 must be @xmath8 times larger than the gas pressure @xmath378 .",
    "on the other hand , the gas pressure at the bottom of an accreted gas layer at an ignition of a nova is expected to be @xmath379 dyne @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "then the magnetic field ( @xmath380 ) necessary for the @xmath8 eddington luminosity is @xmath381 g. interestingly , such highly magnetized wds with super - chandrasekhar masses ( @xmath382 ) are predicted theoretically @xcite .",
    "since the tnr process is expected to last for @xmath8  s at the bottom of the accreted mass layer on the surface of wds @xcite , the rate of mass ejection probably peaked between the scans at @xmath32  s and @xmath33  s. it means that maxi scans at @xmath27  s and @xmath32  s observed the photospheric expansion phase ( b @xmath140 c in fig .  1 of * ? ? ? * ) , while the maxi scan at @xmath33  s observed the shrinking phase ( c @xmath140 d in the same figure ) .",
    "the strong neon emission line at @xmath33  s suggests that there was an optically - thin thermal emission region surrounding the photosphere and filled with ejecta dredged - up from a massive o - ne wd .",
    "such ejecta may have been provided by the previous photospheric expansion .",
    "it must be noted that the existing models of the tnr do not predict this surrounding emission line region .",
    "this observation provides us new physical details .    in this scenario , the optical enhancement observed by _ swift _",
    "uvot is no longer the usual photospheric emission of nova ejecta . since the optical decay seems correlated with the decay of sss x - ray emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] , middle and bottom ) , it can be explained by the reprocessed emission from the x - ray irradiated circumstellar disk of the be star .",
    "it is justified by the fact that the size of the optical enhanced emission ( @xmath383  cm ; section  [ sec : follow - up ] ) is comparable to the disk scale height @xcite .",
    "monitor of all - sky x - ray image ( maxi ) discovered an extraordinarily luminous soft x - ray transient , maxi j0158@xmath0744 , near the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) on 2011 november 11 .",
    "this source is a binary system consisting of a white dwarf ( wd ) and a be star at the distance of the smc .",
    "maxi detected it in three scans at @xmath27  s , @xmath32  s and @xmath33  s after the trigger time .",
    "the x - ray luminosity peaked on the second scan at @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 ( @xmath133 kev ) , which is two orders of magnitude brighter than the eddington luminosity of a solar mass object .",
    "the spectrum of the third scan showed a he - like neon emission , suggesting that the emission contains an optically - thin thermal component and the wd is a massive o - ne wd . while the x - ray outburst could be considered as a kind of nova on the basis of the luminosity and the spectral evolutions , the huge peak luminosity and the rapid rise time ( @xmath384  s ) are difficult to explain by shock - induced emission , accepted for optically - thin thermal emission in nova explosions observed so far .",
    "instead , we propose the scenario that the x - ray outburst is the direct manifestation of the thermonuclear runaway process at the onset of the nova explosion , the so - called fireball phase .",
    "the super - eddington x - ray outburst and the subsequent very early super - soft source phase indicate a small ejecta mass , implying the underlying wd is unusually massive near the chandrasekhar limit , or possibly exceeding the limit .",
