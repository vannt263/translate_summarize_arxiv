    "quantum information processing offers great advantages both for quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the latter is implemented by unitary operations on a set of two - level systems known as qubits .",
    "these unitary operations are usually decomposed as quantum gate arrays .",
    "depending on what unitary operation is desired , different gate arrays are used @xcite . by contrast",
    ", a classical computer can be implemented as a fixed classical gate array_cpu _ ( central processing unit ) , into which is input a _",
    "program _ , and _",
    "data_. the program specifies the operations to be performed on the data .",

    "( circuit of gates ) is preferable because we could verify whether it has been prepared correctly or not before using the software , and we can discard or repair it with little cost if it is found to be faulty . in contrast , if hardware fails badly during the execution of a computation , for example some gates in the circuit are found be set wrong or failed , it might be necessary to build a whole new hardware .",
    "the possibility to build analogous _ qcpu _ ( quantum central processing unit ) was first studied by nielsen and chuang @xcite .",
    "the problem was originally formulated in term of a programmable array of quantum gates , which can be described as a fixed unitary operator @xmath0 , that acts on both the program and the data .",
    "the initial state , @xmath1 , of the _ program register _ stores information about the unitary operation u that is going to be performed on a _ data register _ initially prepared in a state @xmath2 .",
    "the total dynamics of the programmable quantum gate array is given by @xmath3 nielsen and chuang demonstrated that there does not exist deterministic universal quantum gate array which can be programmed to perform any unitary operation .",
    "recently vidal _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and kim _ et al . _",
    "@xcite respectively proposed schemes to store arbitrary one - qubit unitary operations in quantum states and to retrieve them with the probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the number of qubits used to encode the unitary operation on one qubit .",
    "_ presented a probabilistic quantum processor for qudits on a single qudit of dimension @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the above schemes are alike in storing unitary operations and retrieving them from program register precisely , but all of them are in a probabilistic fashion . thus for these schemes if @xmath6 gates are used in total computation the overall success probability is @xmath7 , which tends to fail exponentially with @xmath6 . and it is not clear how to implement universal quantum computations by a fixed hardware .    either model for classical computer or for quantum computer is to be realized by physical system finally .",
    "however real numbers require infinite information ( and therefore infinite energy ) for their representation . since there appears to be bounds on the energy of any physical system ( the universe included )",
    ", we can only approximate real numbers in computers @xcite .",
    "so any model of computer that is realized by physical system only needs to represent finite accurate things and to perform computation with finite accuracy , or in other words discrete model of computer is sufficient .",

    "thus any unitary operation on data register can be approximated by qcpu with the designed is .",
    "let us explain how the qcpu works .",
    "quantum states are dominated by quantum laws , such as non - clone principle and measuring collapse .",
    "it is impossible to reset information of a qubit in an unknown state@xcite .",
    "so it is not straightforward for the basic operations such as inputting instructions to program register .",
    "we will describe two working modes of the qcpu , which are illustrated in fig .",

    "the first working mode expands computation in the time sequence , and needs only one qcpu , and no measuring is needed during the computation . in this working mode we need to initialize program register to some known state , such as @xmath39 , and to design is(programs ) before implement the computation .",
    "steps of serial processing of qcpu are illustrated in table .",
    "[ processing ] .",
    "we use the notation @xmath40 to stand for program register or data register , if @xmath41 is in capital form , or to indicate the state of it , if @xmath41 is in capital form with subscript of number .",
    "[ processing ]    cccccccc step & @xmath42 & @xmath43 & @xmath44 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & ... +   + @xmath48 & @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath50 & @xmath51 & @xmath52 & @xmath53 & ... + @xmath11 & @xmath49 & @xmath49 & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & @xmath57 & ... +   + decoder & - & @xmath58 & - & @xmath59 & - & @xmath60 & ... + qcpu & - & - & @xmath61 & - & @xmath61 & - & ... +    to make it more clear on how the operations are encoded in is , here we give some examples of is : specifically we suppose that data register have 2 qubits , and @xmath62 , then program register have 6 qubits @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64    the angle @xmath65 of rotation is calculated as @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the second working mode expands computation in the space sequence , so many qcpus are needed according to the number of instructions used in is .",
    "the advantage of this working mode is that it can accept the instruction by teleportation that is unknown to user .    in both working modes non - unitary operations",
    "can be implemented by performing measurement right after operating qcpu .",
    "qcpu can implement superposed unitary operations by having the program register in superposition state , and implement entangled unitary operations by having the program register in entangled state .",
    "suppose @xmath69 is in state @xmath70 , then @xmath71 one simplest example is that the operation @xmath0 is the cnot gate .",
    "when the control - qubit is in superposition such as @xmath722}(\\vert 0 \\rangle + \\vert 1 \\rangle)$ ] , the unitary operations that implemented by the cnot gate are superposed : not operation and identity operation are performed in a superposed way on the controlled - qubit .",
    "this makes the qcpu very different from the classical cpu .    if we do not plan to utilize the benefits brought by the quantumness of the program register , than we may built hybrid qcpu which has the data register in qubits and the program register in classical bits",
    "this hybrid qcpu is also capable of implementing any quantum computation on n - qubit data register , but only need @xmath12 qubits and @xmath13 classical bits .",
    "now let us explain why arbitrary unitary operation on the data register can be approximated by qcpu .",
    "it was explained above that qcpu can implement cnots on the data register , and can approximate rotations on @xmath73 along x - axis and z - axis with accuracy @xmath74 . then based on the fact that any single qubit operation can be expressed as at most three rotations about two non - parallel axes , qcpu is capable of approximating arbitrary single qubit operation on @xmath75 . with the help of the swap gate which can be accomplished by three cnots ,",
    "qcpu can approximate any single qubit operation on any qubit of the data register .",
    "we have known that cnots and arbitrary single qubit operations together can complete universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "therefore qcpu proposed above can approximate arbitrary unitary operation on the data register .",
    "the error caused by approximate rotation rather than precision rotation is estimated below .",
    "angles denoted by eq.([angleor ] ) symmetrically distribute between [ @xmath76 , and are implemented by qcpu precisely .",
    "so the error that qcpu approximates an arbitrary angle is less than @xmath77 .",
    "all computation gives outputs at last .",
    "the approximation of the unitary transformations will lead to errors in the resultant output states .",
    "the errors of the outputs , which are from the errors of @xmath65 , are calculated below .",
    "rotation along @xmath78-axis can be expressed as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a pauli matrix , @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 the variation of the output state @xmath83 reads @xmath84 the variation of the probability @xmath85 of projecting @xmath86 onto a state @xmath87 reads @xmath88 so we have @xmath89 .    it is shown that when the output state @xmath90 are projected on the state @xmath87 , the error caused the approximate rotation is linear with the accuracy of @xmath65 .",
    "when there are @xmath6 such unitary transformations @xmath91 before the measurement , we have @xmath92 thus in order to approximate a computation that is implemented by @xmath6 approximate operations to an overall accuracy @xmath9 , each operation only needs to be accurate to @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the number of qubits , which is needed in the program register to approximate any computation on n - qubit data register to accuracy @xmath9 , is calculated below .",
    "we know that any @xmath94 unitary operation can be implemented by @xmath95 cnots and single qubit operations @xcite .",
    "each cnot or single qubit operation can be implement by at most @xmath96 instructions in qcpu .",
    "so the number of instructions needed to implement arbitrary operation on n qubits is @xmath97 .",
    "if the overall computation precision is @xmath9 then each instruction need to be accurate to @xmath98 . rotation implemented by single instruction in qcpu is accurate to about @xmath99 .",
    "so @xmath100 the number of qubits needed in program register is @xmath101 . it is linear with the number of data qubits and @xmath102 , therefore qcpu can be built efficiently to approximate universal quantum computation on any number of qubits to any given computation accuracy @xmath9 .",
    "_ qcpu _ enables one to realize quantum computations with different _ software _ rather than different _",
    "hardware_(circuit of gates ) .",
    "a quantum software is a sequence of particular programmed is that makes a qcpu to perform a specific task .",
    "the notation of _ quantum software _ was first used by preskill @xcite .",
    "he used it in a little different way .",
    "but the virtue of quantum software itself is alike . realizing quantum computation with software rather than hardware is preferable for a lot of reasons .",
    "if the is are in quantum states , qcpu in working mode two is capable of implementing quantum remote control introduced by huelga _",
    "_ in @xcite",
    ". one important virtue of quantum software will be to ensure that quantum computers function reliably .",
    "because quantum states are very fragile , the quantum - computing hardware needs to meet very demanding specifications .",
    "quantum computer can achieve acceptable reliability by applying principles of quantum - error correction @xcite .",
    "quantum - error correction schemes would be most conveniently implemented with quantum software .",
    "some time in the future the fault - tolerant quantum computer , which could possibly be dominated by quantum software , may achieve processing speeds far surpassing the classical computers .",
    "to summarize , we have presented an architecture of qcpu which operates on a @xmath12-qubit data register and is capable of completing any unitary operation with accuracy @xmath9 in a deterministic way .",
    "it contains @xmath103 three - qubit gates and @xmath104 four - qubit gates and needs @xmath103 qubits as its input .",
    "therefore it can be built efficiently .",
    "each gate only concerns at most four qubits , this may be appreciated in real implementations of the quantum computer .",
    "we have described two working modes of qcpu .",
    "qcpu have the ability to implement superposed and entangled unitary operations on the data register , which is shown by eq.([entangledo ] ) .",
    "this ability could help us to implement more efficient algorithm  the number of is needed to implemented a algorithm might be much smaller than the upper bounds @xmath97 .",
    "one noteworthy quality of our architecture is that it can approximate n - qubit universal quantum computation with only n qubit plus @xmath103 classical bits as its input .",
    "so with sufficiently sophisticated hardware qcpu could run on classical software but implement the quantum computation .",
    "qcpu made it possible to put the solution of the problem into software rather than hardware .",
    "this is an important step to the general quantum computer because it is impracticable to build a special hardware for each problem . in the hardware of quantum computer qubits",
    "must preserve coherence during operations .",
    "thus the scale(the number of qubits in quantum hardware ) and the the operating time of quantum computer have a lot of limitations .",
    "when the space complexity(scale ) or time complexity(time ) is beyond the capability of the hardware , programming technique in software may help us to make the balance of space complexity and time complexity .",
    "this possibly enlarges our computation ability under specifical hardware technique . then like the art of programming in classical computer",
    ", the art of programming in quantum computer will settle various kinds of problem with a fixed and general purpose hardware , and the art of programming in quantum computer will also improve the efficiency of algorithms by just refining the program(is ) .",
