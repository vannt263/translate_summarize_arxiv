    "slonczewski @xcite proposed a new method of switching the magnetization direction of a thin film by means of a spin - polarized current .",
    "the current is spin - polarized by passing through a thick layer of a ferromagnetic metal , whose magnetization is assumed to be pinned , subsequently passing through a nonmagnetic metallic spacer layer and then through a thin magnetic switching layer into a nonmagnetic lead .",
    "early related theoretical work is due to berger @xcite .",
    "switching of the magnetization is accompanied by a change in resistance ( cpp gmr ) and the effect has been observed experimentally by studying hysteresis loops in resistance versus current plots for pillar systems @xcite .",
    "jumps in the hysteresis curve occur between steady states of constant current and static magnetization , just as in the stoner - wohlfarth @xcite theory of field - switching jumps occur between equilibrium states .",
    "we have formulated a first - principle theory of current - induced switching based on this idea . as in the stoner - wohlfarth theory , we assume that the switching magnet remains single domain during the switching process .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper is to calculate hysteresis loops of resistance versus current from first principles for a much more general situation than has been considered previously . in previous treatments a uniaxial anisotropy field",
    "was introduced in the switching magnet with its direction parallel to the magnetization of the polarizing magnet @xcite , @xcite . in this case",
    ", there are only two steady states in which the magnetizations of the polarizing and switching magnets are either parallel or antiparallel .",
    "it is for this reason that the steady - state approach has not previously been further developed .",
    "however , in real experiments on pillar structures shape anisotropy due to variable shape of pillar cross sections means that the direction of the anisotropy field in the switching magnet is not simply related to the direction of the magnetization of the polarizing magnet .",
    "furthermore , in some experiments @xcite , @xcite an external field is also applied so that more general orientations of the magnetizations occur in the steady states .",
    "it is , therefore , essential to consider a completely general case when the uniaxial anisotropy field makes an arbitrary angle @xmath11 with the polarizing magnetization .",
    "we also include the easy plane anisotropy , which is always large in layered magnets , and investigate fully its consequences .    in a steady state",
    "there is a balance between the spin - current torque , acting on the switching magnet due to the spin - polarized current , and the torque due to anisotropy and external fields . in our general first - principle treatment , two components of the spin - current torque",
    "appear naturally , one with the torque vector @xmath0 in the plane containing the magnetizations of the two magnetic layers ( in - plane torque ) and another with the torque vector @xmath1 perpendicular to this plane ( out - of - plane torque ) .",
    "slonczewski @xcite considered only @xmath0 and it is generally believed @xcite that @xmath1 is negligible .",
    "we start the presentation of our results in sec.6 by deriving from the general keldysh formalism the results of slonczewski s original calculations @xcite , in which only @xmath0 appears .",
    "it will be seen that this result is not always valid but is just an artefact of slonczewski s simple model .",
    "in fact , we shall show that in some cases @xmath1 is dominant and that , even when small , @xmath1 is essential since its importance is strongly enhanced in the presence of easy - plane anisotropy .    to calculate hysteresis loops for this general scenario , we need to solve the following problems : ( i )",
    "calculate microscopically both the in - plane and out - of - plane components of the spin - current torque ; ( ii ) determine the steady states which form the continuous parts of the hysteresis curve ; ( iii ) investigate the stability of such states in order to determine critical currents at which the jumps , and hence switching , occur ; ( iv ) calculate the resistance of the layered structure along the steady - state paths .    within our unified theory ,",
    "all this can be done for a general layered system with a fully realistic band structure .",
    "a jump in the hysteresis curve occurs at a critical current when one steady state becomes unstable and the system seeks out another stable steady state .",
    "this is in analogy with the stoner - wohlfarth @xcite theory of field - switching where one deals with equilibrium states instead of the present nonequilibrium steady states . as in that theory",
    "we do not concern ourselves with the detailed dynamics of the switching .",
    "however , we identify in this paper certain cases in which one steady state becomes unstable above a critical current but there are no other stable steady states available . under these circumstances",
    "the magnetization of the switching layer remains perpetually in a time - dependent state .    in order to study nonequilibrium steady states we use the keldysh formalism @xcite , @xcite",
    ", @xcite described in sec .",
    "as pointed out above , the steady state arises from a balance between spin - current torque and anisotropy field torque .",
    "hence it is essential to include anisotropy and/or external fields in the hamiltonian of the system from the outset .",
    "it is also necessary to treat correctly the on - site electron - electron interaction which is responsible for the spontaneous magnetization of the polarizing and switching magnets .",
    "this is achieved by insisting that the local exchange field is in the direction of the local magnetization , which is the essential feature of self - consistent field approximations such as unrestricted hartree - fock ( hf ) and local spin density ( lsda ) .",
    "such a treatment respects the spin - rotational symmetry of the ferromagnet in the absence of external fields . beyond this",
    "we do not need to introduce a self - consistent treatment of the coulomb interaction explicitly , although bulk lsda calculations underlie the band parameters and exchange splittings used in our calculations . in our keldysh approach",
    "the direction of magnetization in each atomic plane of the switching magnet is determined self - consistently in the steady state by the requirement that the magnetization of a given atomic plane is parallel to the exchange field in that plane .",
    "the relationship between this approach and the more intuitive one of balancing torques is discussed in secs . 2 and 5 .",
    "the treatment described above enables us to determine all possible steady states of the system and the next step is to investigate their stability .",
    "we do this by introducing the spin - current torques , calculated microscopically as functions of magnetization direction , and anisotropy torques into a landau - lifshitz equation of motion for the magnetization including gilbert damping .",
    "we linearize the equation of motion about the steady - state solution to obtain the conditions for stability .",
    "finally , we construct hysteresis curves from continuous steady - state paths and jumps at points of instability .",
    "the layer structure we consider is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it consists of a    semi - infinite polarizing ferromagnet with magnetization @xmath12 , a nonmagnetic metallic spacer with n atomic planes , a switching magnet with m atomic planes , and a semi - infinite nonmagnetic lead of the same material as the spacer .",
    "each layer is described by a tight - binding model , in general multiorbital with s , p , and d orbitals whose one - electron parameters are fitted to first - principle bulk band structure , as discussed previously @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is , therefore , of the form    @xmath13    where the one - electron hopping term @xmath14 is given by    @xmath15    where @xmath16 creates an electron in a bloch state , with in - plane wave vector @xmath17 and spin @xmath18 , formed from a given atomic orbital @xmath19 in plane m. h@xmath20 is an on - site interaction between electrons in d orbitals which leads to an exchange splitting of the bands in the ferromagnets and is neglected in the spacer and lead .",
    "the magnetization of the polarizing magnet is assumed to be pinned in the ( z , x)-plane , making an angle @xmath11 with the z axis , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath21 contains effective fields in the switching magnet corresponding to uniaxial @xmath22 and easy - plane @xmath23 anisotropies .",
    "it is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the operator for the total spin angular momentum of plane @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xmath22 and @xmath23 are given by @xmath28    @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a unit vector in the direction of the thermal average of @xmath25 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 are unit vectors in the direction of the axes shown in fig.1 .",
    "@xmath34 , @xmath35 measure the strengths of the uniaxial and easy - plane anisotropies and have dimensions of frequency . these quantities may be converted to a field in tesla by multiplying them by @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that anisotropy fields are uniform throughout the switching magnet but it would be easy to generalize to include , for example , a surface anisotropy . the spin angular momentum operator @xmath25 is given by @xmath37 and the corresponding operator for spin angular momentum current between planes @xmath38 and @xmath26 is @xmath39 here , @xmath40 , where the components are pauli matrices and eq.(8 ) yields the charge current operator if @xmath41 is replaced by a unit matrix multiplied by the electronic charge @xmath42 , where e is the electronic charge ( negative ) .",
    "all currents flow in the y direction , perpendicular to the layers , and the components of the vector @xmath43 correspond to transport of x , y , and z components of spin .",
    "the rate of change of @xmath25 in the switching magnet is given by @xmath44+[{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ s$}}_{n},h_{anis } ] \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the spin operator commutes with the interaction hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath46=i\\hbar ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ j$}}_{n-1}-{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ j$}}_{n } ) \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath47=-i\\hbar ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ h$}}_{a}\\times { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ s$}}_{n } ) , \\label{eq11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in a steady state , the magnetization is time - independent so that @xmath48 .",
    "hence @xmath49 the left - hand side of eq.(12 ) corresponds to the rate of transfer of spin angular momentum to plane @xmath26 in the steady state .",
    "thus eq.(12 ) shows explicitly how , in the steady state , this spin - transfer torque is balanced by the torque due to anisotropy fields .",
    "the concept of spin - transfer torque was first introduced by slonczewski @xcite .",
    "in this section we show how to calculate the spin current @xmath50 and spin density @xmath51 in the non - equilibrium steady state and verify that they are related by eq.(12 ) . to produce a spin - polarized current in the system",
    "we apply a bias @xmath52 between the polarizing magnet and the lead . to use the keldysh formalism @xcite , @xcite , @xcite to calculate @xmath50 and @xmath51 we consider an initial state at time @xmath53 in which the hopping integral @xmath54 between planes @xmath38 and @xmath26 is switched off .",
    "then both sides of the system are in equilibrium but with different chemical potentials @xmath55 on the left and @xmath56 on the right , where @xmath57 .",
    "the interplane hopping is then turned on adiabatically and the system evolves to a steady state .",
    "the cleavage plane , across which the hopping is initially switched off , may be taken in either the spacer or switching layer or in the lead .",
    "fig.1 shows the situation when the cleavage plane is between atomic planes @xmath38 and @xmath26 in the switching magnet . in principle , the keldysh method is valid for arbitrary bias @xmath52 but here we restrict ourselves to small bias corresponding to linear response .",
    "this is reasonable since for larger bias electrons would be injected into the switching magnet far above the fermi level and many - body processes neglected here would be important . furthermore , in metallic systems the bias will never be large .",
    "following keldysh @xcite , @xcite , we define a two - time matrix @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and we suppress the @xmath17 label .",
    "the thermal average in eq.(13 ) is calculated for the steady state of the coupled system .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 has dimensions @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the number of orbitals on each atomic site , and is written so that the @xmath64 upper diagonal block contains matrix elements between @xmath65 spin orbitals and the @xmath64 lower diagonal block relates to @xmath66 spin .",
    "@xmath62 hopping matrices @xmath67 and @xmath68 are written similarly and in this case only the diagonal blocks are nonzero .",
    "if we denote @xmath67 by @xmath69 , then @xmath70 .",
    "we also generalize the definition of @xmath71 so that its components are now direct products of the @xmath72 pauli matrices @xmath73 and the @xmath64 unit matrix . the thermal average of the spin current operator , given by eq.(8 ) ,",
    "may now be expressed as @xmath74{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}}\\}. \\label{eq14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] introducing the fourier transform @xmath75 of @xmath76 , which is a function of @xmath77 , we have @xmath78{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}}\\}. \\label{eq15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , the charge current is given by eq.(15 ) with @xmath79 replaced by the unit matrix multiplied by @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , the total spin angular momentum on atomic planes on either side of the cleavage plane , in the non - equilibrium state , is given by @xmath80 @xmath81 following keldysh @xcite , @xcite , we now write @xmath82 where the suffices @xmath83 and @xmath84 are either @xmath85 or @xmath86 .",

    "note that in @xciteand @xcite the definitions of @xmath89 and @xmath90 are interchanged and that in the green function matrix defined by these authors @xmath91 and @xmath92 should be interchanged .",
    "charge and spin current , and spin density , are related by eqs.(15)-(17 ) to the quantities @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the latter are calculated for the coupled system by starting with decoupled left and right systems , each in equilibrium , and turning on the hopping between planes @xmath86 and @xmath85 as a perturbation .",

    "the final result for the spin angular momentum on plane @xmath26 to the right of the cleavage plane is @xmath96 where the two contributions to the spin angular momentum @xmath97 and @xmath98 are given by @xmath99 \\label{eq21}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath100 .",

    "defined by eq.(16 ) , we must interchange @xmath86 and @xmath85 , and @xmath69 and @xmath107 , everywhere in eq.(20)-(22 ) . in the linear - response case of small bias which we are considering , the fermi functions in eq.(22 ) are expanded to first order in @xmath52 .",
    "hence the energy integral is avoided , being equivalent to multiplying the integrand by @xmath108 and evaluating it at the common zero - bias chemical potential @xmath109 .",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the magnetization @xmath12 of the polarizing ferromagnet is assumed to be fixed in the @xmath110 plane and makes an angle @xmath111 with the @xmath112 axis , which is the direction of the uniaxial anisotropy field in the switching magnet .",
    "when a bias is applied , spin - polarized current flows through the switching magnet and exerts a torque on its magnetization .",

    "is defined as an angular frequency so that @xmath119 is the energy to reverse the spin on plane @xmath26 .",
    "more precisely , the spin - dependent part of the on - site energy on plane @xmath26 is given by @xmath120 .",

    "\\label{eq25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by considering the changes in @xmath126 , @xmath127 when the cleavage plane is moved one atomic plane to the right , it is straightforward to show that @xmath128 this equation holds for a steady state with arbitrary exchange fields @xmath115 which do not necessarily satisfy the self - consistency condition ( 23 ) .",
    "when the self - consistency condition ( 23 ) is satisfied , we recover the steady - state result @xmath129 which was derived earlier [ eq.(12 ) ] purely from considerations of the spin - rotational symmetry of the electron - electron interactions .",
    "this verifies the consistency of the keldysh formalism combined with the unrestricted hartree - fock approximation .",
    "it follows from eqs.(26 ) and ( 27 ) that all components of spin current are conserved within the spacer and lead , where @xmath130 , with or without self - consistency .",
    "furthermore , it follows from eq.(27 ) that in the self - consistent steady state the component of spin current in the direction of the anisotropy field @xmath131 is conserved throughout the system , as of course is the charge current .",
    "if eq.(27 ) is summed over all planes in the switching magnet , we obtain @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 are the spin currents in the spacer and lead , respectively , and @xmath135 is the total spin angular momentum of the switching magnet .",
    "this shows how the total spin transfer torque acting on the switching magnet is balanced by the torque exerted by the anisotropy field on the total moment .",
    "we have separated in eq.(20 ) the spin angular momentum @xmath51 into two parts @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath98 is proportional to the applied bias @xmath52 to the first order and for zero bias ( @xmath136 ) only @xmath97 remains .",
    "the spin transfer torque @xmath137 similarly splits into two parts ( eqs.(24),(25 ) ) in such a way that eq.(26 ) holds for each component separately : @xmath138 only the first part @xmath139 is nonzero at zero bias .",
    "it corresponds to spin currents which mediate exchange coupling , either between the two magnets across the spacer or between atomic planes in the switching magnet .",
    "consequently , at zero bias the spin current in the lead is zero .",
    "it is easy to verify that the expressions for interlayer exchange coupling derived here , using the keldysh formalism , agree precisely with those obtained earlier by other methods @xcite .",
    "the results of this section show the great advantage of the keldysh formalism , even within the linear response regime .",
    "spin currents at zero bias , corresponding to exchange coupling , transport spin and particle currents , and spin densities are all calculated in a unified way .",
    "relationships between these quantities , such as eq .",
    "( 29 ) , are then easily derived . in the standard linear response theory of kubo",
    "zero - bias quantities can not be calculated and different response functions would have to be introduced for calculating currents and spin density response at finite bias .",
    "in the general theory outlined in sec.3 the steady - state spin orientation of each atomic plane @xmath26 of the switching magnet must be determined self - consistently . in this section",
    "we first consider the simplest case of a single orbital on each site and when the switching magnet is a single atomic plane . in this case",
    "there is no interplane exchange coupling in the switching magnet to consider and we assume that the spacer is sufficiently thick for the zero - bias exchange coupling between the two ferromagnets to be negligible . for a given bias @xmath52 , the direction @xmath140 of the steady - state orientation of the switching magnet moment @xmath141 is determined self - consistently from eq.(23 ) with the cleavage plane immediately to the left of the switching plane so that @xmath142 .",
    "it is convenient to determine @xmath140 in two steps .",
    "the first step locates a universal path on a unit sphere , independent of @xmath52 , on which the self - consistent solutions for any given @xmath52 must lie . in the second step the bias @xmath52 required to stabilize the magnetization in a given direction @xmath140",
    "is determined as a function of @xmath143 , say . to establish this program ,",
    "we write eq.(23 ) as @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the exchange field of the switching layer in the direction @xmath140 . splitting @xmath141 into two parts as in eq.(20 ) , this becomes @xmath146 hence using eq.(29 ) we have @xmath147 the first two terms on the left correspond to exchange coupling torque which , as discussed above , is assumed to be negligible compared with the anisotropy torque .",
    "this is justified for thick spacers since the interlayer exchange coupling tends to zero as the spacer thickness tends to infinity .",
    "the last two terms on the left correspond to the spin transfer torque @xmath148 , which is proportional to bias @xmath52 , and the right - hand side of eq.(32 ) is @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is the torque exerted by the anisotropy field on the switching magnet .",
    "we shall see that , in contrast to the exchange coupling torque , @xmath148 remains finite as spacer thickness tends to infinity .",
    "hence @xmath151 and , in particular , @xmath152 the bias @xmath52 now cancels and this equation determines the universal path described above .",
    "eq.(33 ) determines the bias required to stabilize any particular point on this path of possible steady states .",
    "we conclude this section with one example in which , for simplicity , we retain only uniaxial anisotropy , this field being chosen in the z direction .",
    "we use a single - orbital tight - binding model whose lattice is taken to be simple cubic with layering in the ( 010 ) direction .",
    "the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath153 is taken to be the same throughout the system . the on - site energy in the spacer and lead is taken as @xmath154 , the zero of energy being at the common fermi level for zero bias . in this example",
    "the on - site energy @xmath154 is also taken for majority spin in the ferromagnets ( perfect matching in the majority - spin channel ) .",
    "the on - site energy for minority spin in the ferromagnets is taken as @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the exchange splitting .",
    "the matching of spacer and majority spin bands is similar to the situation in co / cu .",
    "we take @xmath157 in units of @xmath158 .",
    "furthermore , we take the uniaxial field parameter @xmath159 which corresponds to a field of @xmath160 . we also take a general value @xmath161 radians of the angle between the polarizing magnet moment and the direction of the uniaxial anisotropy axis of the switching magnet . to determine the torque @xmath148 which appears in eq.(34 ) for the universal path",
    ", we need to calculate the green functions @xmath162 which are required in eq.(25 ) .",
    "this is done by standard adlayering methods described previously @xcite .",
    "at this stage , the anisotropy field is included in the calculation of all the green functions .",
    "fig.2 shows the calculated universal path of @xmath163 versus @xmath164 for the    specified parameters .",
    "the bias @xmath52 required to yield a steady - state magnetization at a given point of this path is plotted as a function of @xmath164 in fig.3 , where we have assumed the band width @xmath165ev .",
    "positive bias corresponds to a drop in voltage between the polarizing magnet and the lead .",
    "the correspondence between the two curves in fig.2 and fig.3 is indicated by letters p and q. the discussion of stability of these steady states and the interpretation of fig.3 is postponed to section 7 .",
    "the method of calculating steady states used in this section becomes more complicated when the switching magnet contains several atomic planes since the moments @xmath51 of all planes must be determined self - consistently .",
    "this entails the inclusion of the exchange stiffness between atomic planes of the switching magnet which is contained in eq.(29 ) with @xmath166 . to address this problem ,",
    "we introduce in the next section the simplifications required to derive from first principles the convenient standard model used by previous authors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in the keldysh method used above it is essential to include the anisotropy field @xmath131 in the hamiltonian to obtain a non - trivial steady state . in the absence of @xmath131 it follows from eq.(27 )",
    "that in the steady state all components of spin current are conserved everywhere so that there are no spin - transfer torques .",
    "hence the only steady state is the trivial one in which the switching magnet is aligned parallel or antiparallel to the polarizing magnet .",
    "previous authors @xcite , @xcite did not consider a steady state but calculated spin - transfer torque as a one - electron problem with the exchange fields of the polarizing and switching magnets at a fixed assumed angle . in a second independent step , these authors @xcite , @xcite balance the spin - transfer torque against the torque due to anisotropy field in the context of a landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "this approach is what we call the standard model ( sm ) . in this section",
    "we show how to arrive at the sm by making some simplifying approximations in our self - consistent approach .",
    "we begin with the monolayer switching magnet of sec.4 . in eq.(33 )",
    "the spin - transfer torque @xmath148 is calculated in the presence of @xmath131 and the spin @xmath141 is the self - consistent moment . to obtain the sm we must neglect @xmath131 in the calculation of @xmath148 and replace @xmath141 by its nonself - consistent value in the direction of the assumed exchange field of the switching magnet .",
    "these approximations are both reasonable provided the exchange field is much stronger than the anisotropy field , which is satisfied for a ferromagnet such as co. this follows since the green functions which determine both @xmath148 and @xmath141 depend on the total field @xmath167 .",
    "thus in the sm the spin - transfer torque is calculated as a function of the angle between the magnetizations without solving the self - consistency problem .",
    "furthermore , equating it to the anisotropy torque as in eq.(33 ) is equivalent to calculating a steady state of the landau - lifshitz equation .",
    "the justification of the sm for a switching magnet with more than one atomic plane is more subtle .",
    "the self - consistency condition ( 23 ) must be satisfied for each plane in the switching magnet .",
    "it may be written [ c.f .",
    "eq.(30 ) for the monolayer ] @xmath168 and , using again @xmath169 and eq.(29 ) , we obtain @xmath170 the first two terms contain the interlayer exchange coupling , which is neglected as in the monolayer case , and interplane exchange coupling within the switching magnet . to clarify the argument , we write notionally this last contribution in terms of local exchange stiffness @xmath171 between atomic planes @xmath38 and @xmath26 . hence from eq.(36 ) @xmath172 on summing over all planes @xmath26 in the switching magnet the internal exchange coupling torques cancel and we have @xmath173 in the fully self - consistent solution of eq.(35 ) the exchange field @xmath115 is parallel to the local moment @xmath51 but the @xmath115 are not collinear . to proceed to the sm we must assume that all the @xmath115 used to calculate the spin - transfer torque on the left of eq.(38 ) are equal , to @xmath145 , say .",
    "furthermore , we assume , as in the case of the monolayer , that we can neglect @xmath131 in the calculation of the spin - transfer torque and that all @xmath51 are in the direction @xmath145 with magnitude equal to the ground state moment .",
    "in making the approximation @xmath174 we have failed to satisfy eqs.(37 ) individually as is required for full self - consistency .    to show that this is not serious for a ferromagnet such as co ,",
    "consider the following argument .",
    "if we use the uniform value of @xmath145 determined from eq.(38 ) , as described , to calculate the spin - transfer torque in eq.(37 ) and assume all @xmath51 are in the direction of @xmath145 , the last two terms of eq.(37 ) are zero and the equations are far from satisfied . however , since the exchange stiffness constants @xmath171 of a ferromagnet such as co are large one need only introduce small deviations of @xmath115 from the uniform @xmath145 , and consequently small deviations of @xmath51 from uniformity , to satisfy the self - consistent equations ( 37 ) .",
    "this is true because the spin - transfer and anisotropy torques are insensitive to these small deviations .",
    "the ability of the sm to simulate the fully self - consistent solution accurately has been verified numerically for a switching magnet with two atomic planes using the single - orbital model of sec.4 .",
    "in the calculation of the spin - transfer torque @xmath148 within the standard model the anisotropy field is neglected so that @xmath148 depends only on the angle @xmath175 between the magnetization @xmath12 of the polarizing magnet and the assumed exchange field @xmath145 of the switching magnet . as in fig.1 ,",

    "these spin components are referred to by previous authors @xcite , @xcite as spin accumulation. in the self - consistent steady - state treatment of sec.4 such deviations do not occur because the exchange field is always in the direction of the local moment .",
    "in our view , time - independent spin accumulation @xmath187 , @xmath188 in the ferromagnet is a non - physical concept which , however , we may define formally as the ratio of torques @xmath189 , @xmath190 , to the exchange field @xmath191 .",
    "it is remarkable that , as shown in sec.5 , the sm in which this concept arises provides a convenient and frequently accurate method for calculating spin - transfer torque .",
    "time - dependent spin accumulation in the ferromagnet in a non - steady state could be a valid concept .",
    "however , these time - dependent spins would produce time - dependent exchange fields which would excite the whole spin system .",

    "the spin transfer torque can be calculated either directly from eq.(39 ) or from eq.(40 ) .",
    "however , the latter would require calculating @xmath98 for each atomic plane of the switching magnet so that the direct method is obviously preferable .",
    "we begin with an exactly solvable one - band model which we can connect with previous work @xcite .",
    "this model is related to the one described at the end of sec.4 , where the switching magnet is a single atomic plane and there is perfect matching between the spacer band and the majority spin bands in both ferromagnets . to obtain analytical results in this first example",
    ", we also assume that the exchange splitting @xmath195 both in the polarizing and switching magnets .",
    "in fact , once the bottom of the minority - spin band is well above the fermi level , the results are rather insensitive to the magnitude of @xmath191 .",
    "such a system is sometimes referred to as a half - metallic ferromagnet and is the first case considered by slonczewski in his original paper @xcite . in the limit @xmath195",
    "the sm model is exact since the moment of the switching magnet can not deviate from the exchange field and the self - consistency condition ( 23 ) is automatically satisfied .",
    "we , therefore , calculate the spin - transfer torque in the absence of anisotropy field . clearly , owing to the infinite exchange splitting",

    "it turns out in this model that the y - spin current in the spacer , which is equal to the torque @xmath190 since the corresponding current in the lead is zero , vanishes .",
    "thus only slonczewski torque @xmath189 survives and is given by @xmath197 here , @xmath198 is the majority spin surface green function for the semi - infinite ferromagnet , or equivalently for the semi - infinite ferromagnet with an overlayer of the matching spacer .",
    "the green function @xmath199 is evaluated at energy @xmath200 , the common fermi level of the unbiased system .",

    ". it should be noted that the torque @xmath189 goes to zero for @xmath210 since the charge current for a halfmetallic magnet contains a factor @xmath211 .    the interesting result that @xmath212 for this model may be traced to an effective reflection symmetry of the system about a plane at the center of the spacer .",
    "although the present system appears asymmetric the infinite exchange splitting makes it equivalent to a symmetric system with semi - infinite switching magnet .",

    "it is clear that they both oscillate but tend to constant values as @xmath226 in our ballistic limit . in zero bias",
    "all spins of the system lie in the ( z , x ) plane and it is , therefore , not surprising that when charge current flows in nonzero bias there are finite z - spin and x - spin currents for arbitrary spacer thickness .",

    "the polarizing magnet is a semi - infinite slab of co , the spacer is 20 atomic planes of cu , the switching magnet contains @xmath219 atomic planes of co with @xmath219=1 and 2 , and the lead is semi - infinite cu .",

    "it can be seen that the out - of - plane torque @xmath190 becomes smaller than @xmath189 for thicker switching magnets .",

    "it is also interesting that beyond the monolayer thickness , the ratio of the two torques is positive with the exception of @xmath232 .",
    "in sec.4 we calculated the steady - state orientation of the magnetization of the switching magnet fully self - consistently as a function of bias @xmath52 ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "these results allow us to calculate the continuous portions of the hysteresis loops of resistance versus bias , but to determine where jumps occur we must investigate the stability of the steady states .",
    "this can not be done within the standard keldysh formalism since the dynamics of the system , including damping , lies outside its scope .",
    "we , therefore , map the microscopic problem onto a phenomenological time - dependent landau - lifshitz ( ll ) equation with gilbert damping .",
    "an approach based on ll equation has been used previously @xcite , @xcite but our treatment differs in several important ways .",
    "firstly , we use as an input microscopically determined torques @xmath189 , @xmath190 . in previous work",
    "only @xmath189 was considered and its magnitude was an adjustable parameter .",
    "secondly , the importance of the steady state concept in the context of the ll equation has not previously been fully recognized .",
    "finally , the consequences of easy plane anisotropy have hardly been explored ; we find that , in fact , it can lead to completely new switching scenarios when @xmath189 and @xmath190 have the opposite sign . even in the absence of easy plane anisotropy , @xmath189 and @xmath190 with the opposite sign",
    "may lead to qualitatively different types of switching .    in sec.6 the unit vector in the direction of the switching magnet moment @xmath233 was always taken in the @xmath112 direction but to discuss the ll equation we must consider @xmath233 in a general direction .",
    "the total spin - transfer torque @xmath234 may be written quite generally as the sum of the two components in the directions of the vectors @xmath235 and @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetization of the polarizing magnet .",

    "4 that the @xmath241 factor accounts for most of the angular dependence of @xmath189 , @xmath190 so that to a good approximation @xmath246 , @xmath245 are constants , proportional to bias .",
    "the ll equation takes the form @xmath255 with the reduced total torque @xmath256 given by @xmath257 where @xmath135 is the total spin angular momentum of the switching magnet and @xmath258 is the gilbert damping parameter .",
    "following sun @xcite , eq.(51 ) may be written more conveniently as @xmath259 we first consider steady - state solutions of this equation but shall return to the full time - dependent equation when discussing stability of these states . in the steady state eq(51 ) reduces to @xmath260 which is equivalent to eq.(33 ) .",
    "the magnetization unit vector @xmath243 of the polarizing magnet is given by @xmath261 and in the phenomenological treatment , based on the sm , the magnetization of the switching magnet is uniform in the direction @xmath262 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the procedure for finding steady states is exactly analogous to that described in sec.4 for the microscopic approach .",
    "thus the universal path on the unit sphere consisting of points ( @xmath263 ) which correspond to possible steady states , independent of bias , is again given by eq.(34 ) .",
    "for given @xmath11 the torque @xmath264 is now defined explicitly as a function of @xmath265 and @xmath163 by eqs.(47 ) , ( 48 ) , the bias factor in the constants @xmath245 , @xmath246 cancelling as before .",
    "similarly , using eq.(54 ) , we can plot @xmath265 against bias @xmath52 for the actual steady state in the given bias as in fig.3 .",
    "we now return to eq.(51 ) to discuss stability of the steady states .",
    "the torque @xmath256 is given by @xmath266 where the relative strength of the easy plane anisotropy @xmath267 , using the notation of eqs.(5 ) , ( 6 ) .",
    "the last two terms correspond to @xmath0 , with strength parameter @xmath268 , and @xmath1 , with strength parameter @xmath269 .",
    "clearly the reduced bias @xmath268 is proportional to the actual bias @xmath52 and inversely proportional to the number of atomic planes in the switching magnet . comparing eqs.(47 ) ,",
    "( 48 ) , and ( 55 ) we see that @xmath270",
    ". thus if the scalar torques @xmath6 , @xmath5 defined after eq.(50 ) have the same sign it follows that @xmath271 is positive .",

    "it is easily seen that in this case the inequality ( 59 ) is always satisfied and the system becomes unstable when the left - hand side of eq.(60 ) changes sign at @xmath307 , corresponding to sun s @xcite result in zero external field .",
    "this shows clearly that the criterion for magnetization switching derived by slonczewski @xcite and sun @xcite in their very special case is equivalent to the instability of a steady state in our approach .    in another special case when we have only out - of - plane torque @xmath1 , the switching criteria are clearly the same as in the stoner - wohlfarth field - switching theory since the torque @xmath1 is equivalent to one arising from an effective field of magnitude @xmath308 ( see eq.(55 ) ) .",

    "this follows from eq.(60 ) as long as the easy - plane anisotropy is strong enough for @xmath332 to be satisfied .",
    "this stabilizing effect of easy - plane anisotropy has the unwelcome consequence that the critical bias ( current ) for switching is strongly increased by such anisotropy .",
    "the corresponding hysteresis loop of resistance versus bias for @xmath333 radians is shown in fig .",
    "we have also transferred the key points from fig .",
    "11b . in fig .",
    "12b we show the hysteresis loop for @xmath334 radians , which is close to @xmath335 assumed in previous treatments @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is rather interesting that the critical bias for switching is @xmath4 0.2mv both for @xmath333 and @xmath334 radians . when this bias is converted to the current density using the calculated ballistic resistance of the junction , we find that the critical current for switching is @xmath10 , which is in very good agreement with experiment @xcite . however , there is a qualitative difference between the cases @xmath333 and @xmath334 radians . for @xmath333 radians ,",
    "switching is determined by the instability condition ( 59 ) which is independent of the damping parameter @xmath258 .",
    "this means that switching is of the stoner - wohlfarth type . on the other hand , for @xmath334 radians , we find that the instability is determined by eq.(60 ) , which means that switching is of the slonczewski - sun type .",
    "the last example we consider employs again a mapping of the fully realistic microscopic torques for co / cu(111 ) shown in fig .",
    "7a onto the macroscopic model . in this case",
    "the number of atomic planes in the switching magnet is @xmath230 .",
    "we use the same values of @xmath280 , @xmath258 , @xmath34 , and @xmath111 as in the previous example . the best fit to the microscopic torques in fig .",
    "7a gives @xmath336 .",
    "this example , besides being again a realistic one , introduces the feature of negative @xmath271 which we met in the single - orbital model with parameter set ( d ) ( see figs . 4 and 10b ) .",
    "the plot of reduced bias @xmath268 against @xmath164 is shown in fig . 13 with stable steady states indicated as before .",
    "the low - bias part of the curves is plotted in fig .",
    "13b on a larger scale .",
    "the fact that @xmath337 is comparable for figs .",
    "11 and 13 ( of the order of 1 ) but the sign is changed , leads to all the bias curves being essentially only reflected in the @xmath164 axis .",
    "however , the change of sign of @xmath271 is seen to have a dramatic effect on the stability of the steady states .",
    "the most striking effect is the creation of a bias - gap with no stable steady states for values of reduced bias @xmath338 between about 0.7 and 10 .",
    "for @xmath313 the bias - gap only exists in the presence of easy - plane anisotropy . in this connection",
    "we may compare fig.13 , with parameters @xmath313 , @xmath322 , @xmath339 , @xmath333 with fig.10b correponding to @xmath313 , @xmath294 , @xmath340 , @xmath333 .",
    "( the larger value of @xmath258 for fig.10b is not important ; it was used to push the point of instability a to larger bias and thus clarify the figure ) .",
    "clearly there is no bias - gap in fig .",
    "10b with @xmath294 .",
    "another effect of large @xmath280 is to push the point of instability g in fig .",
    "13b to much larger bias than the corresponding point in fig.10b , even with a smaller damping parameter @xmath258 . in fact , for the particular values of @xmath258 and @xmath280 used for fig . 13",
    ", g lies at a larger bias than e. the resultant hysteresis loop , shown in fig.14a , is thus executed in the same sense as that shown in fig.12a .",
    "however in fig . 14b , corresponding to @xmath341 instead of 2 , the sense is reversed .    in fig .",
    "12 as we change bias from b to c or from f to g we are achieving saturation by aligning the switching magnet parallel or antiparallel to the polarizing magnet . however , in fig .",
    "14 as we increase bias from f the steady state becomes unstable at the point g , for a critical bias , but there is no stable state for the system to jump to with further increase of bias ( see fig .",
    "to emphasize this point , the points g and c are starred in fig .",
    "thus for bias larger than this critical one the system can not home in on any stable state and the moment of the switching magnet remains perpetually in a time - dependent state . for much larger bias the system can home in onto the stable multiple loop states shown in fig .",
    "thus there is a range of bias where only the time - dependent state is possible .",
    "the bottom of the gap occurs at the bias point g in fig .",
    "if the bias is then reduced below this value the system will home in on a stable steady state and the hysteresis loop can be completed .",
    "we investigated the critical negative value of @xmath271 at which the bias gap appears .",
    "for the parameters used above , the gap is not present for @xmath342 but is already well established for @xmath343 .",
    "thus when in - plane and out - of - plane spin - transfer torques have opposite sign , and easy plane anisotropy is large , only a small out - of - plane torque is required to produce this unusual bias gap behavior .",
    "since out - of - plane torque corresponds to an effective field , we believe that this behavior is closely related to the time - dependent motion of the moment of the switching magnet which is observed in a sufficiently large applied magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this alternative mechanism for time - dependent motion of the switching magnet moment is under investigation .    even in the absence of easy plane anisotropy , but with large negative @xmath271 , we have found a critical bias above which only time - dependent solutions exist .",
    "however , for small negative @xmath271 ( @xmath344 ) normal solutions can occur ( no bias gap ) . for intermediate values of @xmath271 , as discussed for @xmath313 with reference to fig .",
    "10b , switching may or may not occur .",
    "furthermore , in the case of pure in - plane torque ( @xmath299 ) and no easy plane anisotropy we find straightforward switching of slonczewski - sun type for @xmath345 , while for @xmath346 a more complicated hysteresis loop is found .",
    "our principal result is that spin - transfer torques responsible for current - induced switching of magnetization can be calculated quantitatively for real systems such as co / cu / co junction in the ballistic regime using nonequilibrium keldysh formalism .",
    "in fact , we argue that the spin - transfer torque can be calculated selfconsistently from first principles only in a steady state ( switching magnet magnetization does not move ) , and this is precisely what the keldysh formalism is designed for . in the small - bias ( linear - response ) regime higher - order",
    "( many - body ) effects can be neglected and our results for the spin - transfer torque are , therefore , quite rigorous .",
    "keldysh formalism provides an explicit formula for the local spin current between any two atomic planes of the junction in terms of one - electron surface green functions for the cut junction .",
    "the surface green functions are readily available and we calculate them using a tight - binding hamiltonian with parameters determined from a fit to an _ ab initio _ band structure . with the exception of slonczewski s",
    "parabolic band calculation @xcite , our keldysh formulation is the only theory that yields the local spin current taking into into account rigorously contributions from all the parts of the junction . as the following argument demonstrates , previous theories @xcite , @xcite , which consider only scattering of spin - polarized electrons incident from the spacer on the spacer / switching magnet interface are incomplete . when the particle current flows from the polarizing magnet toward the switching magnet it is clear that a spin - transfer torque acts on the switching magnet . however , when the polarity of the applied bias is reversed , the current incident from the right lead on the switching magnet is unpolarized and , therefore , has no effect on it .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known experimentally @xcite that changing the polarity of the bias reverses the direction of the spin - transfer torque ( the magnitude remains the same ) .",
    "this can not be explained within a theory that treats only the spacer / switching magnet interface .",
    "the ingredient that is missing is strong reflection of electrons from the polarizing magnet which results in a spin polarization of the reflected electrons .",
    "clearly only such reflected spin current flowing in the direction opposite to that of the particle current can exert torque on the switching magnet .",
    "it follows that multiple reflections of electrons from the polarizing and switching magnet are an essential feature of the problem .",
    "they are treated rigorously to all orders in our theory .",
    "the fundamental experimental fact that the spin - transfer torque acting on the switching magnet is proportional to the applied bias is obtained naturally in our theory since the spin current anywhere in the junction , given by eq.(25 ) , is proportional to the difference between the fermi functions for the left and right halves of the cut junction , i.e. , proportional to the bias in the low - bias ( linear - response ) limit .",
    "these arguments indicate that selfconsistent treatment of the whole junction is crucial for correct understanding of current - induced switching of magnetization .",
    "the spin - transfer torque calculated from our keldysh formalism has two components , one with the torque vector @xmath0 in the plane containing the magnetizations of the two magnetic layers ( in - plane torque ) and another with the torque vector @xmath1 perpendicular to this plane ( out - of - plane torque ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the effective field - like component @xmath1 is always small .",
    "we find that this is not the case and our calculations show that , in general , both the in - plane and out - of - plane components tend to finite values independent of the spacer thickness in the limit of a thick spacer . however , it is true that @xmath1 is strictly zero in the limit of an infinite exchange splitting between the majority and minority - spin bands in both ferromagnets , and this is the case considered initially by slonczewski @xcite . in the realistic case of a finite exchange splitting , @xmath1 is nonzero and can be comparable with @xmath0 .",
    "the only other general case when @xmath1 can be small occurs for a junction with reflection symmetry about a plane at the center of the spacer . hence to observe an effect of @xmath1 one needs to break the reflection symmetry of the junction . for a junction with polarizing and switching magnets made of the same material ,",
    "this is achieved by making the switching magnet thinner than the polarizing magnet , and a strongest effect is found for a switching magnet only a few atomic planes thick .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are comparable for a co / cu / co(111 ) junction when the switching co layer is one or two atomic planes thick .",
    "nevertheless , for a good epitaxial junction ( ballistic limit ) , we find that @xmath2 is @xmath4 27% of @xmath3 even for a switching co magnet as thick as ten atomic planes .",
    "an alternative way to break the symmetry is to use a junction with polarizing and switching magnets made of different materials .",
    "another result we wish to highlight is that , depending on material parameters of the junction , the relative sign of @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be negative as well as positive .",
    "for example , @xmath7 for co / cu / co(111 ) with a switching co magnet of one atomic plane and @xmath8 for two atomic planes of co. the negative sign of the ratio @xmath9 has a profound effect on the stability of steady states and , hence , on the nature of current - induced switching .",
    "finally , to determine the critical currents for switching and to investigate the effect of @xmath1 , we have used the microscopically calculated spin - transfer torques as an input into the phenomenological landau - lifshitz equation with gilbert damping .",
    "our general philosophy is that all steady states can be calculated from first principles and loss of their stability , determined from the landau - lifshitz equation , corresponds to switching .",
    "this holds provided there is another stable steady state at the same current density the system can switch into .",
    "we showed that our criterion for instability of the steady state leads to the same critical current for switching as that obtained earlier by sun @xcite in the special case of @xmath298 and for the initial angle @xmath111 between the polarizing and switching magnet moments equal to @xmath347 or @xmath306 .",
    "however , we find that qualitatively different switching scenarios can occur when @xmath348 , @xmath349 , and in the presence of an easy - plane ( shape ) anisotropy",
    ". in particular , when the easy - plane anisotropy is strong , even a relatively small @xmath2 ( 5 - 10 % of @xmath6 ) has a strong effect on switching . in the absence of an applied magnetic field , we find that an ordinary hysteresis loop is the only possible switching scenario when @xmath8 . however , for @xmath7 , a normal hysterestic switching occurs only at relatively low current densities .",
    "when the current exceeds a critical value , there are no stable steady states and the system thus remains permanently in a time dependent state .",
    "this is analogous to the observed precession of the switching magnet magnetization caused by a dc current in the presence of an applied magnetic field @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the effective field - like term @xmath1 , which causes this behavior , is proportional to the dc current and , hence , complete loss of stability of the steady state occurs only when this term is large enough , i.e. , when the dc current is above a critical value .    our calculations for co / cu / co(111 )",
    "show that the critical current for switching in the hysteretic regime is @xmath10 both for co switching magnets of one and two atomic planes .",
    "this is in good agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "we recall that the critical current for switching is obtained using the spin transfer torques for a fully realistic co / cu / co(111 ) junction and assuming a uniaxial anisotropy of @xmath350 t and gilbert damping @xmath325 .",
    "this is in line with the values of the uniaxial anisotropy and gilbert damping quoted by sun @xcite .",
    "we conclude by stressing that all the specific results we have obtained are strictly valid for a perfect epitaxial junction , i.e. , in the ballistic limit",
    ". however , the keldysh formalism we have described is valid also in the diffusive limit .",
    "generalization to the diffusive limit is , in principle , straightforward .",
    "for example , one could introduce random impurities in the lateral supercell geometry , determine the one - electron surface green functions in this geometry and then perform configuration averaging of the spin current .",
