    "it has been known that the cosmological tests @xcite are a convenient method of studying cosmological gravitational fields .",
    "the most important of them are : magnitude - redshift relation ( hubble diagram ) , count of sources , angular size - redshift relation , etc .",
    "these tests allow one to find the hubble constant  @xmath1 and the deceleration parameter  @xmath2 .",
    "however recent estimates of these parameters , obtained from different tests in the framework of the standard friedmann model , are in rather poor mutual agreement without special additional assumptions ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ". the reasons for these difficulties can be both in unreliability of the observational data ( which is mainly connected with evolution and selection effects ) and in the restriction to the friedmann model based on the equations of general relativity ( gr ) . in this context",
    ", a consideration of cosmological consequences of theories generalizing gr deserves attention .",
    "one of such theories is the 5-dimensional projective unified field theory ( puft ) developed by e.  schmutzer  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the idea of a 5-dimensional unified field theory goes back to the works of kaluza and klein  @xcite .",
    "the pioneers of the projective approach to this theory were veblen and van dantzig  @xcite .",
    "later this approach was further developed by many authors ( the corresponding references and a review of other higher - dimensional unified theories see in  @xcite ) .    in puft gravitation",
    "is described by both space - time curvature and some hypothetical scalar field ( @xmath0-field ) . to characterize",
    "the scalar field predicted in puft as a new fundamental phenomenon in nature , e.  schmutzer introduced the notion `` scalarism '' ( adjective : `` scalaric '' ) by analogy with electromagnetism .",
    "the source of this `` scalaric '' field can be both the electromagnetic field and a new attribute of matter which schmutzer has called `` scalaric mass '' . it should be noted that the presence of the @xmath0-field can lead to essential additions to the general picture of the universe evolution  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider a theory of classical cosmological tests within the framework of puft .",
    "also , we shall investigate the observational parameters of a homogeneous and isotropic model on the basis of puft .",
    "it  is obvious that the presence of the @xmath0-field in the theory leads to an extension of the number of the observational cosmological parameters as compared to the standard friedmann model .",
    "this circumstance , from our point of view , will allow us to make consistent the observational data existing now .",
    "that is primarily the data of cosmological tests , the problem of dark matter , etc .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite and also  @xcite ) .",
    "all the results obtained will be compared with similar predictions of the standard friedmann cosmology .",
    "the version of puft investigated here is based on the postulated 5-dimensional einstein - like field equations . by projecting them into the 4-dimensional space - time one obtains the following 4-dimensional field equations (",
    "the cosmological term is omitted here )  @xcite : @xmath3 are the generalized gravitational field equations ; @xmath4 are the generalized electromagnetic field equations ; @xmath5 is the scalar field equation . here",
    "@xmath6 is the ricci tensor , @xmath7 is the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor , @xmath8 is the scalaric energy - momentum tensor , @xmath9  is the energy - momentum tensor of the nongeometrized matter ( substrate ) , @xmath10 and  @xmath11 are the electromagnetic induction and the field strength tensor , respectively , @xmath12  is the electric current density , @xmath13  is the scalaric substrate density , @xmath14 is einstein s gravitational constant ( @xmath15  is newton s gravitational constant ) .",
    "latin indices run from  1 to  4 ; the comma and semicolon denote partial and covariant derivatives , respectively ; the signature of the space - time metric is  @xmath16 .",
    "these field equations lead to the following generalized energy - momentum conservation law and continuity equation for electric current density : @xmath17 using ( [ 2.2 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) it is possible to show @xcite that in puft , as well as in gr , light rays propagate along null geodesics of space - time .",
    "however , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the energy - momentum tensor of the photon beam . thus the scalar @xmath0-field can lead either to absorption of light or to its amplification .    concluding this section",
    ", it should be mentioned that e.  schmutzer since  1995 has preferred new non - einstein - like 5-dimensional field equations which he applied to cosmology and cosmogony in a series of papers  @xcite . but",
    "this version of puft has slightly different 4-dimensional field equations as compared with the above - stated ones ( one can find a detailed analysis of the geometric axiomatics of puft in  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that both variants are physically acceptable and deserve a comprehensive study .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with the robertson - walker line element in the well - known form : @xmath20 - c^2 { \\mbox{d}}t^2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the scale factor and @xmath22 takes the values @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "for an electrically neutral continuum which is described by the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid the field equations ( [ 2.1 ] ) and ( [ 2.3 ] ) in the metric ( [ 3.1 ] ) lead to the following set of equations ( the dot denotes a time derivative , @xmath25  is the mass density , @xmath26  is the pressure ) : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 while the generalized energy conservation law ( [ 2.6 ] ) gives @xmath30 eqs.@xmath31([3.2f ] ) to  ( [ 3.5f ] ) determine the dynamics of the cosmological model if the equations of state , i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , are known .",
    "the friedmann model corresponds to the special case @xmath34 and @xmath35 of our model .",
    "unfortunately , the above set of differential equations leads  @xcite to an abel equation and till now was solved exactly only in some special cases  @xcite .",
    "now we examine light propagation in a robertson - walker space - time .",
    "consider light emitted from a point with the radial coordinate  @xmath36 at the time  @xmath37 .",
    "the light , propagating along a null - geodesic line , will be received at the point  @xmath38 and at the time  @xmath39 if @xmath40 then the redshift of the light source is given by the usual formula @xmath41 on the other hand , the absolute luminosity  @xmath42 of the source and its apparent bolometric luminosity  @xmath43 are connected by the relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the presence of the multiplier @xmath46 in the last expression is a consequence of eq.@xmath31([2.8 ] ) . using  ( [ 3.4 ] ) , it is possible to show that the flux density of radiation  @xmath47 ( i.e. the power per unit area and per unit frequency interval of a receiver ) is given by @xmath48 }      { ( 1 + z)r^{2}(t_0)\\ ; r^{2}_{1}}\\ ; e^{-3 \\delta \\sigma } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the intrinsic source power per unit solid angle and per unit frequency interval .    with ( [ 3.4 ] ) the luminosity distance  @xmath50 to the source",
    "is determined by the following expression : @xmath51 if  @xmath52 is the linear size and  @xmath53 is the metric angular diameter of the source , then the angular diameter distance  @xmath54 has the form  @xcite : @xmath55 from eqs.@xmath31([3.8 ] ) and ( [ 3.10 ] ) we get @xmath56 hence , taking into consideration the @xmath0-field effects can cause changes in the construction of an extragalactic distance scale .",
    "in deriving theoretical relations that describe the cosmological tests we refer to the small  @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) approximation . in this case we need not integrate rather complex cosmological equations of puft ( [ 3.2f])([3.5f ] ) .",
    "it is only sufficient to require a relevant regularity of the functions  @xmath21 and  @xmath59 .",
    "first we consider the @xmath0-field influence on the relation @xmath60 . to this end , let us examine sources with the same intrinsic luminosity @xmath42 .",
    "the quantities @xmath50 and @xmath61 of each source are bound to its unknown coordinates by the relations ( [ 3.2 ] ) , ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.8 ] ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath62 and @xmath36 are small ( @xmath39 corresponds to the present epoch ) , we can expand @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the series @xmath65,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath66,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the hubble constant and deceleration parameter , respectively , defined in the usual way : @xmath67 the dimensionless parameter @xmath68 , characterizing the scalar field , is given by @xmath69 taking into account eqs.@xmath31([3.2 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) , the expansions ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.2 ] ) allow one to present @xmath50 ( see ( [ 3.8 ] ) ) as a power series in @xmath61 : @xmath70.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this relation can be rewritten as a formula for the apparent luminosity : @xmath71.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , if the equations of puft are valid , then from ( [ 4.8 ] ) and ( [ 4.9 ] ) it follows that , in the case @xmath58 , in astronomical observations , some effective deceleration parameter @xmath72 is measured , and the real deceleration parameter @xmath2 can not be obtained from the hubble diagram .",
    "let us assume that the number of sources per unit physical volume with absolute luminosities within the bounds from @xmath73 up to @xmath74 at the time @xmath37 is @xmath75 .",
    "then the number of sources with radial coordinates from @xmath76 up to @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 from this relation , by taking account of ( [ 3.2 ] ) we obtain that the number of sources with redshifts smaller than @xmath57 and the apparent luminosity greater than @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 here @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are determined from eqs.@xmath31([3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) , respectively : @xmath84 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as in friedmann s cosmology @xcite , we shall assume that the spectrum of all sources has the form @xmath85 with @xmath86 . then , using  ( [ 3.6 ] ) , we find that the number of sources with redshifts smaller than  @xmath57 and with the flux density at frequency @xmath87 greater than  @xmath88 is @xmath89 here @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a solution of the equation @xmath92^{-1-\\alpha } =             \\frac { p(\\nu)\\ ; e^ { -3 [ \\sigma(t_0 ) - \\sigma(t_s ) ] } } { s(\\nu )                        r^2 ( t_0 ) } \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath93 is the space density of sources with the intrinsic power at frequency @xmath87 ranging from @xmath94 up to @xmath95 .    in order to select @xmath0-field effects , we shall restrict our consideration to the case where there is no evolution of the sources .",
    "this means that the sources are not born and do not disappear , and also their luminosity does not depend on time .",
    "then we have  @xcite : @xmath96^{3 } n ( t_0 , l      ) \\ ; , \\qquad { \\mbox{b)}\\quad } n ( t , p ; \\nu ) = \\left [ \\frac{r(t_0)}{r(t ) }       \\right]^{3 } n ( t_0 , p ; \\nu ) \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at low @xmath61 and large @xmath43 or @xmath97 we can use the expansions  ( [ 4.1 ] ) and  ( [ 4.2 ] ) . in this case , from eqs.@xmath31([4.12])([4.18 ] ) we find @xmath98,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath99,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath100.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that eq.@xmath31([4.20 ] ) coincides with a similar result of gr .",
    "thus at  @xmath58 the @xmath0-field does not affect the magnitude @xmath101 .",
    "it is obvious that this follows from  ( [ 4.13a ] ) .",
    "hence , in principle , the experimental values @xmath102 at low  @xmath61 could be used for determining the real deceleration parameter  @xmath2 . at the same time",
    ", measurements of @xmath103 or @xmath104 at large  @xmath43 or  @xmath97 do not give any information about  @xmath2 .",
    "but these measurements could be used to determine the parameter  @xmath105 .",
    "however , it should be noted that , as well as in the standard friedmann cosmology , eqs.@xmath31([4.20 ] ) , ( [ 4.21 ] ) and ( [ 4.22 ] ) are in conflict with observational data ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "for example  @xcite , the counts of radio sources testify that the function @xmath106 decreases with growing  @xmath97 ( at @xmath107 ) approximately as @xmath108 and definitely faster than @xmath109 , and only at low @xmath97 it begins to decrease slower than @xmath109 .",
    "notice that according to ( [ 4.22 ] ) the function @xmath110 will decrease as @xmath109 or faster provided that @xmath111 .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain such a complicated behaviour of the empirical function @xmath110 only by means of the @xmath0-field effects .",
    "consequently , it is necessary to take into account the evolution of the sources .",
    "but in this case the reliability of the results obtained depend on the reliability of evolutionary suppositions . under this circumstance",
    "the determination of cosmological parameters by means of the above test , including the parameter @xmath105 , becomes very complex .      at low redshifts eq.@xmath31([3.10 ] ) for @xmath54 , taking account of ( [ 4.1 ] ) and ( [ 4.2 ] ) , can be rewritten as @xmath112.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this outcome completely coincides with the similar result of standard cosmology .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-field does not influence the relation @xmath113 at @xmath58 .",
    "unfortunately , we can not determine @xmath2 from this relation , because at low redshifts observational errors are much greater than the differences in @xmath2 expected for different cosmological models @xcite .",
    "it is well to bear in mind that , generally speaking , at high redshifts the function @xmath113 will depend on the parameter @xmath105 , because the @xmath0-field is present implicitly in @xmath114 according to ( [ 3.10 ] ) . but @xmath21 and  @xmath115 , contained in ( [ 3.10 ] ) , depend on the @xmath0-field .",
    "it is evident that this remark is correct for the test @xmath102 at high redshifts too .      from eqs.@xmath31([3.4 ] ) and ( [ 3.10 ] ) it follows that the observed surface brightness of sources is given by @xmath116 where we assume that all these sources are identical , i.e. @xmath117 . thus the presence of the @xmath0-field can essentially change the simple surface brightness - redshift relation arising within the framework of  gr : @xmath118 in the work @xcite this equation was proposed to be used as a test for the redshift nature . obviously in the framework of puft eq.@xmath31([4.25 ] ) can be used as a test for the presence of cosmological @xmath0-field effects . from  ( [ 4.25 ] ) , taking account of  ( [ 4.1 ] ) and  ( [ 4.2 ] ) , we find @xmath119.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the parameters @xmath2 and  @xmath1 are absent in this expression .",
    "consequently , at low redshifts the surface brightness - redshift relation allows one to estimate the @xmath0-field effects in a pure form .    in the work @xcite , the relation @xmath120 for a family of giant elliptical galaxies with small  @xmath61 was investigated within the framework of the standard friedmann model . in this paper",
    "the observed curve for the dependence of  @xmath121 on @xmath122 is just a little more slanting than the straight line with a slope equal to  @xmath123 . according to  ( [ 4.27 ] ) , it means that the parameter @xmath124 if only we neglect the evolution effects .",
    "hence , the @xmath0-field has to decrease with time if we assume that  @xmath125 is a monotonic function .",
    "it should be noted that for a correct interpretation of observational data in the framework of puft , obtained , in particular , from the cosmological tests , it is necessary to establish primarily a relationship between the observational cosmological parameters of puft and the mass density and spatial curvature of the present universe . in order to solve this problem , we need the cosmological equations of puft ( [ 3.2f])([3.5f ] ) . from eqs.@xmath31([3.2f ] ) and  ( [ 3.3f ] ) with  ( [ 4.3 ] ) and  ( [ 4.4 ] ) one can find @xmath126 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath127 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the latter equation we obtain that the spatial curvature  @xmath128 is positive or negative depending on whether the mass density is larger or smaller than some critical parameter  @xmath129 : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the so - called critical density .",
    "thus in puft the type of the universe ( open , spatially flat or closed ) results from the comparison of  @xmath132 with  @xmath129 instead of the comparison  @xmath132 with  @xmath133 . notice that the parameter  @xmath129 takes negative values if @xmath134 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless density parameter by @xmath135 and the dimensionless critical parameter by @xmath136 this equality results in that @xmath137 is only valid if @xmath138 .",
    "notice that the universe is closed if @xmath139 and it is open if @xmath140 .",
    "let us now find out how the spatial curvature and the mass density @xmath132 or  @xmath141 are connected with the observational cosmological parameters of puft @xmath142 , @xmath143 and  @xmath105 . in the case of the dust model ( @xmath144 ) , from eqs.@xmath31([b31 ] ) , ( [ b32 ] ) and  ( [ b36 ] ) we find @xmath145 @xmath146 taking into account ( [ b39 ] ) , one can obtain the conditions determining the type of the universe : @xmath147 in the case of a radiation - dominated universe ( @xmath148 ) eqs.@xmath31([b39])([b312 ] ) have the form @xmath149",
    "@xmath150 @xmath151 thus in puft , unlike to the friedmann s cosmology , by measuring only the deceleration parameter  @xmath2 it is impossible to determine whether the universe is closed or open . for this purpose",
    "it is necessary to have the values of the two parameters , @xmath152 and  @xmath153 or @xmath154 and  @xmath68 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in puft a spatially flat universe can be realized for the whole range of values of the mass density  @xmath132 , @xmath155 because @xmath156 if @xmath157 .",
    "however , the condition  ( [ b318 ] ) is necessary but not sufficient for the 3-dimensional space to be flat . recall that in the friedmann model the universe is flat if and only if @xmath158 .",
    "taking into account this circumstance , it is useful to study in more detail the parameters of the theory .",
    "first of all , let us find physically admitted regions for the parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 . to this end",
    "we shall rewrite the natural inequality @xmath159 taking into account  ( [ b310 ] ) and  ( [ b314 ] ) : @xmath160 it is just the inequality which determines the admitted region of the parameter  @xmath152 depending on  @xmath153 ( this region is shaded in fig .  1 ) .",
    "note that  ( [ b43 ] ) is valid for both cases @xmath144 and @xmath161 .",
    "for  @xmath162 , using  ( [ b312 ] ) and  ( [ b43 ] ) , we obtain ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that if @xmath163 or @xmath164 , then a closed universe is only possible ( @xmath165 ) , and if @xmath166 , then an open universe is only possible ( @xmath167 ) , while for @xmath168 all three types of the universe are possible depending on the value of @xmath169 .     depending on @xmath170 .",
    "the parabola corresponding @xmath171 is given for the case of the dust model ( @xmath172).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=70.0% ] +    let us now take into consideration the available experimental data on the magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "these data , obtained in the framework of standard friedmann cosmology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , lead to the estimate @xmath173 . in the case of puft , taking into account eq.@xmath31([4.10 ] ) and the remarks about this equation , we can suppose that the estimate @xmath174 is sufficiently reliable . on this basis",
    "we shall determine the possible values of the parameters  @xmath152 and  @xmath153 .",
    "above all we note that the inequality  ( [ b43 ] ) is consistent with eq.@xmath31([4.10 ] ) if @xmath175 . from  ( [ b43 ] ) and  ( [ 4.10 ] )",
    "we find @xmath176 from ( [ b54 ] ) we learn that , at large @xmath177 , models with the parameter  @xmath152 tending to zero are possible .",
    "this circumstance can be used for coordination of experimental data of the different tests .",
    "it should be noted that in the framework of the friedmann s cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) the very low values for the deceleration parameter  @xmath152 , obtained from counts of sources , contradict the above - mentioned values of  @xmath152 which follow from the magnitude - redshift relation .",
    "we have considered the classical cosmological tests ( hubble diagram , count of sources , etc . ) for a  homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe in the framework of the 5-dimensional projective unified field theory .",
    "the results show that the presence of the scalar @xmath178-field predicted by puft can essentially affect the conclusions obtained from the cosmological tests .",

    "we can only measure some effective deceleration parameter  @xmath179 given by ( [ 4.10 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that all the expressions describing cosmological tests in the small  @xmath61 approximation do not depend on the choice of a specific model ( the spatial curvature sign , choice of the equation of state , etc . ) .",
    "the surface brightness - redshift relation can be used as a critical test for @xmath180-field effects , because the @xmath0-field can essentially change the simple dependence of the surface brightness on the redshift in the form @xmath181 which results from friedmann s cosmology .",
    "it seems reasonable to say that the available experimental data testify that the @xmath0-field decreases with time .",

    "moreover , the parameter  @xmath129 is smaller than the critical density and can even take negative values .",
    "it should be emphasized that we did not take into account a cosmological constant in the field equations .",
