    "the link between a certain type iip supernova ( sn  iip ) and its main - sequence progenitor is poorly known despite the widely accepted view that these supernovae arise from the initial mass range of @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the primary reasons for the uncertainty in this field are the small number of presupernova ( pre - sn ) mass determinations and the uncertain amount of matter lost through winds , presumably dominated by the red supergiant ( rsg ) wind .",
    "while the former is becoming well - studied , the latter uncertainty is related to our poor knowledge of the complicated physics of mass loss and the unsatisfactory situation with the empirical measurements of mass loss from rsgs . even for the most studied close massive rsg , betelgeuse ,",
    "the range of observational estimates is large : @xmath6 yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the situation for sne  iip has some promise because the dominant mass loss at the rsg stage may be observed by the detection of circumstellar ( cs ) interaction at x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "the type iip sn  1999em was detected in x - rays with _ chandra _",
    "@xcite , leading to the mass loss estimate @xmath7 yr@xmath2 ( assuming a wind velocity of 10 km s@xmath2 ) . a recent study of available x - ray and radio data for sne  iip produced a range of mass loss rates of pre - sn  iip @xmath8 yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the application of these rates to the full rsg stage ( @xmath9 yr ) suggests the loss of @xmath10 for pre - sne  iip .",
    "the wide range of estimates emphasizes the need for the individual determination of the wind density for each particular sn  iip under consideration .",
    "unfortunately , this is not always possible since x - ray and radio observations of sne  iip are often not available .    here ,",
    "we propose two new diagnostics for the wind density in sne  iip that could help .",
    "both rely on spectroscopic observations of h@xmath0 and hei 10830   at the photospheric epoch .",
    "the first one is based on the fact that the interaction of sn ejecta with the wind results in the emission of x - rays from both forward and reverse shocks .",
    "the x - rays cause ionization and excitation of sn ejecta that may be revealed , e.g. , through specific emission lines @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in sne  iip the wind density is low and emission lines caused by cs interaction are extremely weak and can not be detected .",
    "we find , however , that the excitation of h and he produced by x - rays in sn  iip ejecta turns out to be sufficient to be detected as high velocity ( hv ) absorption features in h@xmath0 and hei 10830   lines against the bright sn  iip photosphere .",
    "this is the core of our proposed diagnostic for the wind in sne  iip .",
    "the second proposed probe for cs interaction exploits the possibility that a cool dense shell ( cds ) might form at the sn / cs interface because of radiative cooling .",
    "the cds excited by x - rays could become visible as narrow hv absorption in h@xmath0 .",
    "the velocity of this absorption would provide a direct measure of the expansion velocity of the sn / cs interface , a valuable dynamical characteristic of the cs interaction .",
    "the identification of the expected hv lines in observed spectra is complicated by the presence of weak metal lines @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that hv lines of h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 have been observed in spectra of sne  iip , as previously discussed by @xcite for sn  1999em .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a description of the interaction model and cs interaction effects in the h@xmath0 and hei 10830   absorption lines formed in the unshocked ejecta during the photospheric epoch (   [ sec - mod ] ) .",
    "we then compare our cs interaction models with the available spectra of sne  iip in the h@xmath0 and hei 10830   lines and estimate the wind density for particular sne  iip (   [ sec - inter ] ) . in ",
    "[ sec - narrow ] we address the issue of the h@xmath0 absorption in the cool dense shell at the sn / cs interface of sne  iip .",
    "we discuss implications of our models in the last section .",
    "the model for ejecta - wind interaction effects in h@xmath0 and he  i 10830   lines formed in the sn ejecta consists of three major parts : ( i ) an interaction model that provides the dynamical evolution of the sn / wind interface and the x - ray emission from the reverse and forward shocks ; ( ii ) a model for the ionization and excitation of h and he in the unshocked sn ejecta irradiated by x - rays ; and ( iii ) the calculation of line profiles . we perform ( iii ) using either a standard sobolev approximation or the direct integration of the radiation transfer equation , depending on the validity of the sobolev approximation .",
    "the interaction of sn ejecta with cs wind leads to a canonical double - shock structure @xcite with the forward shock propagating in the cs gas and the reverse shock in the sn ejecta .",
    "we treat the cs interaction of ejecta in the thin shell approximation @xcite in which the double - shock layer is reduced to an infinitely thin shell .",
    "we assume that the freely expanding ( @xmath12 ) sn envelope has a sharp boundary at the velocity @xmath13 and begins to interact with a wind starting some moment ( @xmath14 day ) which corresponds roughly to the shock breakout phase .",
    "free expansion is expected to take several doubling times of the initial radius , or several days , to be set up , but the observations we are modeling are at later times",
    ". the maximum velocity @xmath13 is set by the escape of radiation from the shock wave at shock breakout .    for the density distribution @xmath15 in the sn  iip envelope we use an analytical expression , @xmath16 that closely approximates the combination of an inner plateau and outer power law tail found in hydrodynamic models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are determined by the kinetic energy @xmath19 , ejecta mass @xmath20 , and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 the power law index @xmath21 lies in the range @xmath24 and is henceforth set to be @xmath25 .",
    "we adopt the boundary velocity for a typical sn  iip of @xmath26 km s@xmath2 , which is consistent with models of shock breakout @xcite .",
    "also , the blue edge of the h@xmath11 emission in sn  1999gi on day 1 was observed to be at 15,000 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "hydrodynamical modeling predicts that at the shock breakout phase a thin dense shell forms at the outer boundary @xcite .",
    "the physics of the ` boundary shell ' formation is in the transition from the adiabatic to the radiative regime of shock wave propagation in the outermost layers of the exploding star .",
    "simple considerations of radiative diffusion @xcite give an estimate for the shell mass : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the progenitor star radius and @xmath29 is the velocity at shock breakout , before free expansion has been established . during the acceleration phase",
    "the boundary shell is subject to the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability @xcite and therefore could be corrugated or even fragmented .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the rt instability results in full fragmentation ; 2d or 3d hydrodynamic modeling of the phenomenon is lacking .",
    "we will treat the boundary shell in our model as an intact thin spherical shell which is already in place at the initial moment .",
    "the mass of the boundary shell is presumably equal to the mass of the outer envelope ( @xmath30 ) with an extrapolated power law @xmath31 .",
    "this provides a good estimate of the shell mass for sn  1999em , @xmath32 , in agreement with hydrodynamical modeling @xcite .",
    "the boundary shell is considered below as a seed for the cds that may , or may not , grow further due to radiative cooling at the reverse shock .    to calculate the x - ray emission from the reverse and forward shocks",
    "we assume that the postshock layers are uniform and their densities are 4 times larger than the corresponding preshock density .",
    "we allow the electron temperature to be partially equilibrated , assuming the following interpolation : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electron - ion temperature equilibration time @xcite and @xmath35 is the equilibrium shock temperature with @xmath36 .",
    "the lower limit @xmath37 is indicated by observational data on supernova remnants with shock velocities of @xmath38 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the reverse shock is equilibrated during the photospheric phase for a mass loss rate of @xmath39 yr@xmath2 with a wind velocity of @xmath40 km s@xmath2 , while the forward shock is not .",
    "since the reverse shock is equilibrated and dominates the x - ray luminosity , the uncertainty in @xmath41 does not affect our results .",

    "the wind is assumed to be steady with the density @xmath46 .",
    "since all the interaction effects for low wind velocities ( @xmath47 ) are determined by the wind density @xmath48 , we use hereafter the dimensionless wind density parameter @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the mass loss rate in units of @xmath3 yr@xmath2 and @xmath51 is the wind velocity in units of @xmath40 km s@xmath2 .    the interaction model for a sn  iip with the wind density @xmath52",

    "remarkably , the reverse shock is adiabatic in the self - similar models for the same parameters through this epoch .",

    "the spectrum of x - rays is described below using a standard approximation @xmath72 .",
    "we adopt @xmath73 for the forward shock , a reasonable approximation for temperature @xmath64 kev @xcite , while for the low temperature reverse shock we take @xmath74 .",

    "the energy balance includes the energy deposition due to the absorption of x - rays and the hydrogen photoionization from excited levels by photospheric radiation .",

    "[ f - modha]_a _ ) and the wind density @xmath100 seems to be the least that could be detected by hv absorption in h@xmath0 . for @xmath101 , the strength of the hv absorption increases with the wind density roughly as @xmath102 and for @xmath103 becomes saturated .",
    "the decrease of the velocity of the blue absorption edge is due to the deceleration caused by the dense wind .",

    "[ f - modha]_b _ ) shows that there is an optimal phase at about the middle of the plateau ( @xmath106 d ) when the cs interaction effect is most pronounced . at an early stage ( e.g. , on day 20 ) the cs interaction effect is not clearly seen because of the merging of hv absorption with the strong undisturbed absorption , while at a late stage ( e.g. , 80 d ) hv absorption becomes very faint .",

    "we examined the sensitivity of hv absorption to the power law index @xmath113 of the x - ray spectrum of the reverse shock .",
    "we found that a softer spectrum ( @xmath114 ) and harder spectrum ( @xmath115 ) produce slightly deeper hv absorption , so the preferred case @xmath74 corresponds approximately to a minimal effect of the cs interaction on h@xmath0 .",
    "we checked the sensitivity of hv absorption to the adopted sn bolometric luminosity as well .",
    "the hv absorption strength anticorrelates with the bolometric luminosity , but the dependence is weak .",
    "the mechanism for this dependence is the depopulation of excited levels by photoionization .",

    "the strength of hv absorption in hei 10830   increases between days 20 and 50 but gets weak on day 80 ( fig . [ f - modhe]_b _ ) , resembling the behavior of hv absorption in h@xmath0 .",

    "we now address the issue of the notch that emerged in h@xmath0 in both sn  1999em and sn  2004dj at about day @xmath143 .",

    "we first study the preferred explanation for the notch , h@xmath0 absorption in the cds , and consider the clearly observed case of sn  2004dj . in modeling the h@xmath0 absorption produced by the cds ,",
    "the principal parameters are the column density of the cool gas , and its excitation temperature and turbulent velocity .",
    "the undisturbed or weakly disturbed cds is characterized by a turbulent velocity of the order of the thermal velocity of the cool gas , @xmath144 km s@xmath2 . however , with this turbulent velocity the equivalent width of the hv absorption turns out to be too small .",
    "a possible solution is to increase the turbulent velocity , as expected by the action of the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability of the decelerating thin shell .",
    "a significant deceleration of the model cds of sn  2004dj , about 20% during the first 10 days ( see low energy case in fig . [ f - dyn ] ) , favors the development of the rt instability of the cds followed by mixing of the cool dense gas with hot forward shock gas @xcite .",
    "the mixed cool gas thus can acquire a significant velocity dispersion and turbulent velocities up to @xmath145 of the shell velocity .",
    "both components could contribute to the notch formation : absorption in the weakly disturbed cds and in the mixed cds material .",

    "the absolute value of the radial velocity of the hv absorption produced by the cds ( @xmath158 ) is slightly lower than the velocity of the cds , @xmath159 , owing to the sphericity effect . assuming uniform brightness of the photosphere ( lambert s law ) it is straightforward to show that the average absolute value of the radial velocity of the absorption is @xmath160\\ , , \\label{eq - hva}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the ratio of the photospheric to the cds velocity .",

    "the alternative mechanism is that the notch could form as a result of an enhancement of hydrogen excitation in the unshocked sn ejecta due to the scattering of ly@xmath0 photons emitted from the cds that in turn is irradiated by x - rays from the reverse shock .",

    "we inspected spectra of sn  1999em @xcite and found the signature of a notch in h@xmath11 at the right position ( @xmath180 km s@xmath2 ) between days 39 and 81 .",
    "in fact , @xcite already discussed the presence of the hv absorption in h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 in spectra of sn  1999em and concluded that these features can not be caused by metal line absorptions .",
    "we also find a notch in h@xmath11 in spectra of sn  2004dj obtained by @xcite .",
    "since the hv absorption components of h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 have not been previously mentioned for this supernova , we show parts of the sn  2004dj spectra @xcite retrieved from the sn archive suspect ( fig .",
    "[ f - obs04dj ] ) .",
    "the spectra show conspicuous notches at about @xmath181 km s@xmath2 both in h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 between days 67 and 102 . below we will model hv absorption in both lines in more detail .      here",
    "we present a model that can account for the strength and shape of the notch in h@xmath0 of sn  2004dj at the late photospheric epoch .",
    "preliminary modeling suggests that the simple two - component model of the cds ( narrow and broad ) introduced above is not able to describe the strength of the notch at late times ( @xmath182 d ) : the excitation produced by the x - ray absorption is insufficient .",
    "this suggests the presence of a more efficient excitation mechanism or an additional source of heat .",
    "another problem is the relative depth of notches in the h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 lines : they are comparable and shallow .",
    "this indicates that some veiling is present , possibly due to clumpiness .",
    "both reasons force us to modify the two - component model of the cds absorption .",
    "an important outcome of the rt mixing of the cds material in the forward shock is the growth of the area of the contact surface ( @xmath183 ) between cool and hot gas .",
    "the development of mixing may be thought as the progressive decrease of the minimum linear scale of fragments ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "this process is demonstrated in numerous experiments on the rt instability and in the case of sn / cs interaction is clearly seen in 2d and 3d hydrodynamical computations @xcite .",
    "a fragmentation cascade of a fixed amount of cool gas leads to the scaling @xmath185 , while for a stationary mixing process @xmath186 @xcite .",
    "the growth of @xmath183 and , accordingly , of the surface - to - volume ratio for the mixed cool gas , should lead to a greater role of thermal conduction in the heating of the cool gas at late times .",
    "we speculate that this is the missing factor that could resolve the excitation problem .    to describe the effect of thermal conduction , we introduce a third cds component : an additional broad cds component powered predominantly by thermal conduction .",
    "the mass fraction of the third component is @xmath187 , while the cumulative area of the contact surface for the third component , @xmath188 , can be large , with an area ratio @xmath189 .",
    "we assume that the third component is homogeneously heated by thermal conduction , which is a sensible approximation for a small thickness of sheets of cds gas , @xmath190 cm , comparable to the mean free pass length of hot electrons and protons in the cool dense gas .",
    "the heat flux is presumably a small fraction of the saturated flux @xmath191 ; we adopt @xmath192 to allow qualitatively for the possible suppression of thermal conduction by a magnetic field .",
    "the saturated flux is taken of the form @xmath193 @xcite .",
    "the forward shock is not equilibrated ( @xmath194 ) , so the ion ( proton ) conduction could be significant . in our case ,",
    "the ratio of proton - to - electron thermal flux is @xmath195 and this fact is taken into account . ionization and thermal balance are solved for the dense hydrogen cooled by ly@xmath0 and two - photon radiation .",
    "the rt mixing generally produces an inhomogeneous ( lumpy ) distribution of mixing regions .",
    "this is the result of the existence of a dominant angular scale of the rt instability , about @xmath196 @xcite and of the intermittence of the turbulent mixing .",
    "we describe the distribution of mixed regions as an ensemble of isolated lumps which occupy a fraction @xmath197 of the volume ; @xmath198 corresponds to a homogeneous mixture of cool and hot phases .",
    "the fraction @xmath199 should not be confused with the filling factor of the mixed cool dense gas , which is of the order of @xmath200 .",
    "observationally , the lumpiness of mixing zones could be manifested as a veiling effect , i.e. , a comparable moderate depth of absorption lines with different optical depth ( viz . ,",
    "h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 as in our case ) . to facilitate the treatment of the radiation transfer in the lumpy medium we use an occultation optical depth , @xmath201 , i.e. , the average number of lumps along the radius .",
    "this value is defined by @xmath199 and a ratio of the total thickness of the mixing layer ( forward post - shock layer @xmath202 ) to the mean intercepted length of the lump @xmath203 ( for a sphere , @xmath204radius ) : @xmath205 .",
    "generally , @xmath201 could be different for each of the three components .",
    "however , we assume the same value of @xmath201 for all three components .",
    "the effective optical depth in the line ( @xmath206 ) then can be expressed through the average optical depth of homogeneously distributed cds material @xmath207 and @xmath201 : @xmath208 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we thus consider a three component model of the cool dense gas which includes : ( i ) a narrow cds component with turbulent velocity @xmath209 km s@xmath2 , ( ii ) a broad cds component with @xmath210 km s@xmath2 , both powered by x - rays , and ( iii ) a broad cds component powered by the thermal conduction .",

    "the cds absorption in h@xmath0 is superimposed on the model line profile with the ejecta hv absorption . for the h@xmath11 line ,",
    "the cds hv absorption is superimposed on the background spectrum taken as a linear interpolation between the blue and red wings of hv absorption in the observed profile .",
    "the occultation optical depth @xmath216 ( table 2 ) is chosen to satisfy the ratio h@xmath0/h@xmath11 , while the area ratio @xmath217 is determined from the strength of the absorption .",

    "the ejecta hv absorption is somewhat stronger , which is responsible for the red - blue asymmetry in the model profile .",
    "however , this does not affect the intensity of the cds absorption feature .",
    "the comparison to the two - component model and the behavior of @xmath217 show that the role of thermal conduction increases with time , which is the expected result .",
    "interestingly , the result depends rather weakly on @xmath219 .",
    "this is related to the canceling of effects of the variation of @xmath219 in the thermal excitation of hydrogen and the column density of the third component .",
    "we performed modeling of the cds hv absorption adopting the lower boundary velocity , @xmath126 km s@xmath2 , and found that in this case deceleration of the cds is too slow , which leads to a larger velocity of the cds hv absorption on day 102 than is observed . the value @xmath57 km s@xmath2 is about the least that provides the required deceleration rate of the cds .",
    "although the parameter values used for the third component are reasonable , the modeling can not be considered as proof that thermal conduction actually dominates the excitation of the cds material at a late epoch ",
    "the model contains many assumptions .",
    "yet the need for an additional source of excitation of hydrogen responsible for the hv absorption is an established result .",
    "thermal conduction is a natural mechanism strongly suggested by the inevitable rt instability and mixing of the cds matter with hot gas from the forward shock . on the other hand",
    ", the additional excitation might at least partially be related to enhanced soft x - ray radiation from hot dense inhomogeneities produced by the rt mixing and heated by thermal conduction up to @xmath220  k.      the identification of the features produced by h@xmath0 and h@xmath11 absorption in the cds provides an efficient tool for the direct determination of the velocity of the sn / wind interface in sne  iip . with this value in hand we are able to obtain the wind parameter @xmath105 using the thin shell model of the deceleration .",
    "of course , the method assumes that the ejecta parameters @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath21 are known .    to facilitate the application of this method we use the self - similar solution .",

    "free - free absorption indicates that the wind density in sn  2004dj is twice as low as in sn  1999em @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat discrepant with the present results which indicate similar wind densities for these supernovae .",
    "the wind density of sn  1999em may be overestimated compared to sn  2004dj from radio data because of the uncertain maximum in the 8.47 ghz light curve or a possible contribution of synchrotron self - absorption in sn  1999em @xcite .",
    "the wind density around sn  1999em and sn  2004dj suggests that the amount of the pre - sn material lost at the rsg phase ( @xmath9 yr ) is moderate in these cases . assuming the wind velocity of a typical rsg , @xmath249 km s@xmath2",
    ", we find with @xmath52 that at the rsg stage the mass lost by the rsg wind is @xmath250 . with the ejecta mass of @xmath251 @xcite , @xmath252 enclosed in the neutron star , and @xmath253 lost by the main - sequence wind",
    ", the initial mass of sn  1999em progenitor turns out to be about @xmath254 .    the mass loss rate by massive stars is often estimated using the formula of @xcite in which @xmath255 is defined through the stellar luminosity ( @xmath256 ) , mass ( @xmath20 ) , and radius ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "for the rsg stage , this formula can be modified using the relation between the mass and luminosity @xmath257 obtained from evolution calculations of @xcite in the range @xmath258 for moderate / no rotation . with this relation ,",
    "the mass loss rate by @xcite becomes @xmath259 yr@xmath2 .",
    "since the luminosity at the rsg stage is determined by the mass of the he core which in turn is determined by the initial mass , we should use the initial mass to estimate @xmath255 .",
    "for sn  1999em with @xmath260 and @xmath261 @xcite this formula predicts a mass loss rate @xmath262 yr@xmath2 , i.e. , eight times larger than our value .",
    "a similar result is expected for sn  2004dj .",
    "the disparity between our estimate of the pre - sn mass loss rate and the popular scaling law requires an explanation .",
    "the disparity can not be attributed to a lower metallicity , because the metallicities of ngc 1637 ( host galaxy for sn  1999em ) and ngc 2403 ( host galaxy for sn  2004dj ) are approximately solar @xcite .",
    "the difference can be reduced by a factor of 1.5 if we adopt a higher velocity for the pre - sn wind , @xmath263 km s@xmath2 instead of 10 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the choice of @xmath264 km s@xmath2 is supported by the wind velocity of the massive rsg betelgeuse , @xmath265 km s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this , however , does not completely resolve the problem .",
    "we admit the possibility that the hydrodynamical model of the light curve @xcite might significantly overestimate the mass of ejecta for some unknown reason . in that case , to obtain the wind @xmath266 ( for @xmath263 km s@xmath2 ) the initial mass of the presupernova must be @xmath267 with an ejecta mass of @xmath268 instead of @xmath269 . with the sn energy",
    "reduced accordingly , the depth and position of the hv absorption remain the same ( fig . [ f - modha]_c _ ) .    to conclude , we have found three new probes of the wind density in sne  iip that rely on spectroscopic observations during the photospheric epoch 20 - 100 d of ( 1 ) the ejecta hv absorption in h@xmath0 ; ( 2 ) the ejecta hv absorption in hei 10830  ; and ( 3 ) the hv absorption ( notch ) produced by the cds .",
    "the third method is more practical than the other two because it does not require modeling of the absorption lines ; it uses velocity measurements and the self - similar model for the velocity fit . of course ,",
    "this method , as well as the other two , assumes that we know the ejecta parameters ( @xmath20 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "however , the application of all three methods may be used to constrain ejecta parameters as well .",
    "the first two methods are sensitive to winds with a density parameter @xmath270 . however in h@xmath0 cs interaction effects saturate for large density @xmath271 .",
    "therefore , only hei 10830   remains a useful diagnostic tool for a high density wind with @xmath103 .",
    "for the third method the range of accessible wind density is less certain , because a cds formed by the initial boundary shell could exist in principle even in the case of a low density wind , although the hydrogen excitation and shell density depend on the wind density .",
    "further understanding of the relation between the strength of deep hv absorption and the wind density requires 3d hydrodynamical modeling of the shock breakout phase in the presence of a wind and new spectroscopic observations in both h@xmath0 and hei 10830   lines .",

    "<S> we find that the interaction with a typical red supergiant wind should result in the enhanced excitation of the outer layers of unshocked ejecta and the emergence of corresponding hv absorption , i.e. a depression in the blue absorption wing of h@xmath0 and a pronounced absorption of hei 10830   at a radial velocity of about @xmath1 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we identify hv absorption in h@xmath0 and hei 10830   lines of sn  1999em and in h@xmath0 of sn  2004dj as being due to this effect . </S>",
    "<S> the derived mass loss rate is close to @xmath3 yr@xmath2 for both supernovae , assuming a wind velocity 10 km s@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that , in addition to the hv absorption formed in the unshocked ejecta , spectra of sn  2004dj and sn  1999em show a hv notch feature that is formed in the cool dense shell ( cds ) modified by the rayleigh - taylor instability . the cds results from both shock breakout and radiative cooling of gas that has passed through the reverse shock wave . </S>",
    "<S> the notch becomes dominant in the hv absorption during the late photospheric phase , @xmath4 d. the wind density deduced from the velocity of the cds is consistent with the wind density found from the hv absorption produced by unshocked ejecta . </S>"
