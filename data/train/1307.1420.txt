    "one of the main challenges of modern physics is to construct a theory for quantum gravity , and in particular a theory for quantum cosmology . indeed , general relativity breaks down in the very initial instants of the history of the universe , leading to a cosmological big bang singularity @xcite . in that regime ,",
    "quantum geometry effects are expected to be important and should be taken into account .",
    "loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) @xcite is a promising quantum approach for cosmological systems inspired by the ideas and methods of loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it has been applied mainly to  homogeneous and isotropic  friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models with successful results @xcite .",
    "remarkably , it predicts a quantum bounce mechanism that eludes the initial big bang singularity @xcite . to deal with more complicated systems , and to test the robustness of the results ,",
    "lqc has also been applied to anisotropic models @xcite , as well as to inhomogeneous ones .",
    "the best studied inhomogeneous system is the vacuum @xmath0 gowdy model with linear polarization .",
    "this is a midisuperspace with three - torus spatial topology that contains inhomogeneities ( corresponding to gravitational waves ) varying in a single direction @xcite .",
    "the quantization of this model has been carried out adopting a hybrid approach , which combines techniques of lqc when representing the homogeneous sector of the model with a fock quantization of the inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "more realistic analyses call for the introduction of matter . in this paper",
    ", we will consider the @xmath0 gowdy model minimally coupled to a massless scalar field with the same symmetries as the spacetime metric .",
    "this is probably the simplest inhomogeneous model which contains frw cosmologies as a subset of homogeneous solutions ( which otherwise are not present in the model : in vacuo , the only homogeneous and isotropic solution is flat space - time ) .",
    "actually , this gowdy model can be regarded as an frw background of three - torus spatial topology with anisotropies and ( gravitational and matter ) inhomogeneities propagating on it . though this scenario is not yet completely realistic , because the inhomogeneities vary along a single spatial direction , it provides a further step towards the quantum analysis of physical inhomogeneities in cosmology .",
    "owing to the isometries of the gowdy model , the system admits a family of solutions with local rotational symmetry ( lrs ) , in which the two scale factors of the directions of symmetry coincide . in order to simplify our analysis ,",
    "we will focus on this type of solutions .",
    "the hybrid quantization of this lrs - gowdy model was already described in ref .",
    "the aim of the present work is to introduce well justified approximations to the quantum constraint of that model , keeping under control the conditions for which the approximations are valid , and then pass to consider regimes of physical interest where one can construct approximate solutions . owing to the lqc techniques employed to represent the degrees of freedom of the homogeneous geometry , the hamiltonian constraint of the quantum model is a quite complicated operator .",
    "therefore , finding exact solutions to it is extremely difficult , if not impossible .",
    "the constraint contains mainly two types of terms which pose serious obstructions for its resolution .",
    "first , it includes a difference operator that couples the homogeneous and isotropic part of the background geometry with the anisotropies ( we will call this the anisotropy term ) .",
    "second , there appears an interaction term for the inhomogeneities ( which is also coupled to the homogeneous and isotropic background and to the anisotropies ) .",
    "the anisotropy term has an intricate action .",
    "our strategy will be to approximate it by another operator that , while retaining the discreteness and the main properties of the loop quantization , has a simpler action on the anisotropies , so that one can carry out its spectral analysis",
    ". our approximation will be valid for states in the sector of high energies of the homogeneous and isotropic part of the background geometry , and with a suitably smooth profile for the anisotropies .",
    "moreover , once this approximation is made , we will be able to find sets of states for which not only the contribution of this anisotropy term is negligible , but also the interaction term in the inhomogeneities can be disregarded . in this way , we will get a well justified approximation of the hamiltonian constraint by a solvable one . from the solutions of this latter constraint",
    ", we will be able to construct approximate solutions for the gowdy model .",
    "these approximate solutions retain the interaction between the homogeneous and isotropic frw background and the free energy of the inhomogeneities .",
    "therefore these solutions are suitable , e.g. , to conduct investigations about the robustness of the quantum bounce scenario of lqc when inhomogeneities are included , or about modifications in the evolution of the matter inhomogeneities when quantum geometry effects are taken into account .",
    "we leave for future work the analysis of those questions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hgm ] we summarize the main results of the hybrid quantization of the @xmath0 gowdy model with lrs and minimally coupled to a massless scalar field . in sec .",
    "[ sec : app ] we introduce the approximations that are needed to go from the quantum hamiltonian constraint of the gowdy model to a solvable one in which the anisotropy term and the interaction term are not present .",
    "this includes approximating the hamiltonian constraint of the bianchi i homogeneous model ( when no inhomogeneities are considered in the system ) by the constraint of a homogeneous and isotropic frw model corrected with some anisotropy contributions .",
    "the section contains some technical considerations about our approximations for the anisotropy term and the class of states for which they are valid .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : sol ] we construct approximate solutions for the gowdy model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : c ] we conclude and present the main results of this work .",
    "we consider the linearly polarized @xmath1 gowdy model with lrs and minimally coupled to a free massless scalar field @xmath2 with the same symmetries as the metric .",
    "the hybrid quantization of this model has already been carried out by the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite , by extending to the case with matter the hybrid quantization of the model in vacuo @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we summarize the main steps of this quantization .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for further details .",
    "we call @xmath3 the three orthogonal spatial coordinates for the gowdy spacetimes , each of them defined on the circle . because of the symmetries , matter and gravitational fields have spatial dependence only in e.g. @xmath4 , so that they can be expanded in fourier modes in this coordinate .",
    "our starting point is the reduced classical system that results after a partial gauge fixing .",
    "the resulting reduced phase space consists in a homogeneous sector which coincides with the phase space of the bianchi i model with lrs and minimally coupled to a homogeneous massless scalar @xmath5 ( the zero mode of the matter field @xmath2 in the introduced fourier expansion ) , and in an inhomogeneous sector formed by the non - zero modes of the linearly polarized gravitational wave and of the matter field , together with their canonically conjugate momenta .",
    "this reduced model is subject to two global constraints : a momentum constraint generating rigid rotations in @xmath4 and a hamiltonian constraint that generates time reparametrizations .",
    "our hybrid approach consists in adopting a fock quantization for both the gravitational and matter inhomogeneities , a standard schrdinger representation for the homogeneous massless scalar field @xmath5 , and a loop quantization within the improved dynamics scheme for the bianchi i variables @xcite .",
    "let us first focus on the representation of the bianchi i phase space .      in the loop approach the phase space of this model",
    "is described by the three non - vanishing components ( in a diagonal gauge ) of the corresponding @xmath6 ashtekar - barbero connection , @xmath7 , and by the three non - vanishing components of the densitized triad , @xmath8 . for the model with lrs under consideration",
    "we have to impose the restrictions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these variables have non - vanishing poisson brackets @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 denotes the immirzi parameter and @xmath14 the newton constant . in these variables",
    "the hamiltonian constraint of the lrs bianchi i model coupled to @xmath5 reads @xmath15 + \\frac{p_\\phi^2}{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 stands for the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath5 .    the improved dynamics scheme accounts for the existence of a minimum non - vanishing eigenvalue @xmath17 of the area operator in lqg .",
    "this scheme involves first the introduction of the following variables @xcite @xmath18 we note that @xmath19 is proportional to the physical volume of the bianchi i universe ( which has compact @xmath0 topology ) , with a sign that indicates the orientation of the triad , while @xmath20 can be used to measure the anisotropy . on the other hand , in the case of complete isotropy ,",
    "when all directions present an equivalent behavior and , in particular , @xmath21 equals @xmath22 , one can easily check from the above formulas that @xmath23 .",
    "this remark will be important to understand the physical interpretation of our approximations later on in this work .",
    "we also note that the variables do not form a canonical set ( not even a set closed under poisson brackets ) , since we get the following poisson algebra @xmath24 in the loop quantization of the model , one  polymerizes \" the connection , what means that its components @xmath25 and @xmath26 have no well - defined operator in the quantum theory .",
    "instead , one considers their holonomies along straight edges whose fiducial length is chosen according to the improved dynamics scheme .",
    "these holonomies can be described in terms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the geometry degrees of freedom of the model are represented as operators on a kinematical hilbert space that can be constructed as the completion of the linear span of the basis of eigenstates @xmath29 of the triad variables defined in eq . , where the labels @xmath30 .",
    "the completion is made with respect to the discrete inner product @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 act by multiplication on the elements of this basis : @xmath34 clearly , they have a discrete spectrum that runs over the whole real line , since all the considered eigenstates have unit norm with the introduced inner product .",
    "on the other hand , the holonomy operators cause the following shifts @xmath35 as one can deduce from the canonical commutation relations @xmath36=i\\hbar\\widehat{\\{e^{\\pm ib_{a}},v}\\}$ ] and @xmath37=i\\hbar\\widehat{\\{e^{\\pm ib_{a}},\\lambda_\\theta}\\}$ ] , where @xmath38 stands both for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .    as a result of the loop representation ,",

    "more specifically , we choose an ordering analog to that proposed in refs .",

    "moreover , states with vanishing @xmath19 and/or @xmath20 get totally decoupled .",
    "this allows us to remove the latter from the kinematical hilbert space and , furthermore , to restrict then all considerations e.g. to the subspace spanned by states @xmath48 with @xmath49 . for convenience , instead of working with @xmath20 from now on , we will work with its natural logarithm @xmath50 .    finally , adopting a standard schrdinger representation for the homogeneous massless scalar field , @xmath51 , the hamiltonian constraint of the lrs bianchi i model , given in eq .",

    "taking into account the action that @xmath55 has on a generic state @xmath56 , which can be easily worked out from the action of the operators defined in eqs . and , the geometric sector of the kinematical hilbert space ( with definite sign of @xmath19 and real @xmath57 )",
    "can be further superselected in separable subspaces . on the one hand ,",
    "as it happens to be the case in the frw model , @xmath55 preserves the subspace of states whose quantum number @xmath19 belongs to any of the semilattices of step four @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each of them characterized by the minimum value allowed for @xmath19 , namely , the label @xmath59 . on the other hand , concerning the anisotropy variable @xmath57 , and as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we get that the iterative action of the constraint operator relates any given state @xmath60 only with states whose quantum number @xmath57 is of the form @xmath61 , with @xmath62 belonging to the set @xmath63 this set is countable and dense in the real line @xcite .",
    "we will denote by @xmath64 the domain of definition of @xmath55 , with @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 the schwartz space of rapidly decreasing functions of @xmath5 . in turn , we denote the corresponding hilbert space as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are respectively the completion of @xmath71 and @xmath72 with respect to the discrete inner product , and @xmath73 .      for the totally deparametrized @xmath0 gowdy model , it has been shown that there exits a privileged fock representation for the gravitational and matter fields @xcite .",
    "this fock representation is the unique one ( up to unitary equivalence ) admitting a unitary implementation of the dynamics and whose corresponding vacuum is invariant under @xmath74 translations ( i.e. , rotations in @xmath4 ) , which is the gauge group of the reduced system .",
    "the fock quantization picked out in this way is characterized by a specific choice of configuration variables @xmath75 for the gravitational field and @xmath76 for the matter field , choice that in particular involves a time dependent rescaling of the minimally coupled matter scalar field in terms of the homogeneous variables of the bianchi i sector ( @xmath77 ) . besides",
    ", the selection of canonical momenta for @xmath75 and @xmath76 is also completely specified by the criteria of unitarity of the dynamics and symmetry invariance that determine the fock quantization .",
    "the two fields @xmath75 and @xmath76 have the same dynamical behavior and a similar description , since they contribute to the system in the very same way ( they have an identical equation of motion , namely , that of a free scalar field with time - dependent mass evolving in a 1 + 1 minkowski spacetime ) . the fock representation can be constructed by considering as creation and annihilation - like variables those that one would naturally introduce if @xmath75 and @xmath76 were massless free fields ( with canonical momenta coinciding with their times derivatives ) .    based on this uniqueness result , we adopt the commented field parametrization @xmath75 and @xmath76 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the gravitational and matter inhomogeneities ( i.e. , the non - zero modes ) of our model , and describe them in terms of the creation and annihilation - like variables mentioned above . by adhering to this fock quantization we will ensure that , in those regimes where the deparametrized description is valid , the corresponding quantum evolution of the fields is unitary and the gauge symmetry is respected .",
    "thus , we promote our variables to creation and annihilation operators @xmath78 , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "we call @xmath81 the associated fock space @xcite .",
    "these operators are densely defined in the space of @xmath82-particle states @xmath83 , with @xmath84 , and where @xmath85 is the occupation number in the mode @xmath86 of the field @xmath87 .    with this representation at hand",
    ", we can now promote the momentum constraint ( generating rotations in @xmath4 ) to an operator .",
    "it reads @xmath88 it only acts on the inhomogeneous sector , imposing a mild restriction on the allowed occupation numbers of the n - particle states @xmath89 ( the sum of the occupation numbers multiplied by their respective mode numbers must be zero )",
    ".      with both sectors of the model already represented , we can now promote the hamiltonian constraint of our gowdy model to a symmetric operator .",
    "the result is @xcite @xmath90 here @xmath91^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "the last two terms couple the homogeneous background with the inhomogeneities , and contain respectively the free contribution of the non - zero modes @xmath92 a self - interaction term for these inhomogeneities @xmath93 and a term coming from a regularization of the inverse of the volume @xcite : @xmath94 for large values of @xmath19 , the function @xmath95 approaches the unit , whereas it vanishes in the limit where @xmath19 tends to zero . in the construction of the free and self - interaction terms for the inhomogeneities , we have adopted normal ordering with respect to the vacuum of the selected representation ( namely , the one which would be natural in the massless case ) .",
    "our constraint operator is well defined in the hilbert space @xmath96 , with dense domain given by the subspace @xmath97 .",
    "we see that , if we ignore the inhomogeneities and the anisotropies , the hamiltonian constraint of the gowdy model reduces to that of the flat frw coupled to a homogeneous massless scalar field , @xmath54 .",
    "we will focus our attention on a regime where the effects of the anisotropies and the interactions between the inhomogeneities can be disregarded , so that then the gowdy model can be viewed , in the commented sense , as a flat frw background with gravitational and matter `` perturbations '' coupled between them only by the addition of their free - field energy contribution to the hamiltonian constraint [ as well as by the constraint of vanishing total field momentum ] .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian constraint @xmath98 is excessively complicated to find its solutions , @xmath99 ( here , the dagger denotes the adjoint ) . even assuming that @xmath98 is essentially self - adjoint",
    ", its intricate expression prevents us from determining the form of the ( generalized ) states in its kernel .",
    "this obstruction is due mainly to three facts .",
    "first , regarding the operators that affect the gravitational part of the homogeneous sector , we have that @xmath100 and @xmath45 do not commute , and hence can not be diagonalized simultaneously , complicating the resolution in the variable @xmath19 .",
    "besides , and more importantly , @xmath45 and @xmath101 , defined on @xmath102 , do not commute either .",
    "this extends the problems for solving the constraint , as far as the homogeneous sector is involved , to the whole of the geometry degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , while the operator @xmath103 acts diagonally on the @xmath82-particle states , the operator @xmath104 creates and annihilates a pair of particles in every mode , and therefore creates an infinite number of them ( nonetheless , let us emphasize that it is well defined in @xmath105 @xcite ) .",
    "these complications call for the introduction of approximations in order to solve the hamiltonian constraint , both for the gowdy model and for the particular case in which the inhomogeneities are unplugged .    for the regime of negligible effects of the anisotropies and of the inhomogeneities interactions that we are interested in , it is convenient to diagonalize the operator acting on the homogeneous and isotropic sector , and use a basis of its eigenstates for our discussion , namely , a basis of the operator @xmath106      as it is well known , the operator @xmath107 in @xmath67 is essentially self - adjoint , and has an absolutely continuous , doubly - degenerate , and positive spectrum .",
    "its delta - normalized ( generalized ) eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath108 are the plane waves @xmath109 , with wavefunction @xmath110 they provide a resolution of the identity in @xmath111 given by @xmath112 .    on the other hand , the operator @xmath45 has been analyzed in detail in the lqc literature ( see e.g. refs .",
    "it is essentially self - adjoint with domain in @xmath71 , and has an absolutely continuous , non - degenerate , and positive spectrum . in each of the superselection sectors corresponding to the semilattices @xmath113 ,",
    "its delta - normalized eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath114 , @xmath115 , are defined via the recurrence relations @xmath116 such that @xmath117 .",
    "note that the eigenfunction @xmath118 is then real , up to a constant phase , determined by @xmath119 .",
    "these generalized eigenstates provide a resolution of the identity in @xmath69 , given by @xmath120 .",
    "we have computed these eigenfunctions numerically .",
    "they have the following properties :    * @xmath118 is exponentially suppressed for @xmath121 ( see left graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : frwaut ] ) . * for @xmath122 ,",
    "these eigenfunctions converge to a linear combination of two eigenfunctions of the operator analog to @xmath45 in the wheeler - de witt ( wdw ) quantization @xcite .",
    "this wdw limit is given by the function @xmath123 with @xmath124 and @xmath125 a function of @xmath126 independent of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "this oscillating behavior can be seen very clearly in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frwaut ] .     for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the graph on the left shows the exponential suppression for small values of @xmath19 , whereas the graph on the right displays the oscillatory behavior at large @xmath19 .",
    "a logarithmic scale is used in the horizontal axis of both graphs.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=48.0% ]   for @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "we explain how to approximate these terms by much more manageable operators .",
    "the behavior of the eigenfunctions @xmath118 allows us to deal with the first complication that we have mentioned , concerning the fact that @xmath45 and @xmath100 do not commute .",
    "indeed , for @xmath131 much larger than the unit , let s say @xmath132 , we have @xmath133 this result was expected since @xmath134 for @xmath135 , and the eigenfunctions of the gravitational part of the frw constraint operator are exponentially negligible for @xmath136 . we have checked this approximation by comparing the matrix elements @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "this comparison has been performed :    \\i ) analytically , by approximating @xmath118 by its wdw limit @xmath139 for @xmath140 and by zero for @xmath141 , and estimating then the discrete sums in @xmath19 by means of integral expressions , making the replacement @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the largest of @xmath126 and @xmath144 ;    \\ii ) numerically , by computing the two considered types of matrix elements , namely , those of the operators @xmath145 and @xmath45 .",

    "this would happen for instance for @xmath153 .",
    "nonetheless , numerically , the difference between the matrix elements of the two operators remains finite even in this limit in which the cumulative sum is extended to infinite large values of @xmath19 .",
    "hence , for eigenstates @xmath154 with @xmath155 , the contributions of the @xmath100 operators in the interaction term of the hamiltonian constraint can be disregarded .",
    "the anisotropy term @xmath101 is more difficult to handle . to start with , it does not factorize in two operators acting on @xmath69 and @xmath70 separately , but acts on @xmath156 as a whole . on the other hand ,",
    "the action upon the anisotropy label @xmath157 is quite complicated , something that makes a spectral analysis of the operator unviable in practice . to overcome these problems",
    "we will approximate the operator @xmath101 by another operator @xmath158 such that : i ) it factorizes , namely @xmath159 is well defined in @xmath69 ( with domain of definition @xmath71 ) and @xmath160 is well defined in @xmath70 ( with domain of definition @xmath161 ) ; and ii ) @xmath160 produces a constant shift in the anisotropy label , so that its domain can be further restricted in the superselection sector just to states with support in a lattice of constant step .",

    "first , when taking the approximation , we have ignored the discrete nature of the geometry , extending the wavefunction @xmath164 to the real line , instead of treating it as a function of the anisotropy label defined in the superselection sector @xmath191 .",
    "now we will restore that discreteness to capture the essence of the loop quantization in the anisotropies . with this aim ,",
    "we approximate the first derivative @xmath192 by a discrete derivative at the scale @xmath165 @xmath193 note that @xmath194 must be a point in the set @xmath195 in order to preserve the original superselection sector .",
    "if , according to our previous discussion , we only consider non - negligible gravitational frw contributions in the sector @xmath173 , it suffices to adopt a scale @xmath196 .",
    "the shift @xmath194 must be small enough for the approximation to apply on sufficiently general anisotropy wavefunctions , allowing us to disregard contributions coming from higher - order difference terms ( i.e. , higher - order derivatives in the continuum ) .",
    "thus , the closest @xmath194 is to @xmath197 , the better is our approximation .",
    "later on , when constructing approximate solutions to the gowdy hamiltonian constraint , we will comment further on the choice of this parameter .",
    "the discrete derivative @xmath160 is well defined in @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is a lattice of constant step .",
    "the closure of @xmath200 in the discrete norm will be called @xmath201 .    the second aspect in which we can improve our approximation , at least for practical purposes , concerns the operator @xmath159 .",
    "recall that the contribution of the region @xmath136 is exponentially suppressed in the frw eigenfunctions .",
    "therefore , for @xmath155 , we can restrict all considerations to the sector @xmath135 . in this sector , one can approximate @xmath202 by @xmath203 and , consequently , functions of @xmath19 appearing in the definition can be approximated so that @xmath159 becomes @xmath204 \\sqrt{\\frac{|\\hat v|}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is completely analogous to the geometry operator @xmath46 , introduced in eq .",
    ", except for the replacement of the canonically conjugate variables @xmath205 by the new pair @xmath206 . in particular",
    ", this analogy shows immediately that @xmath207 , with the domain @xmath208 , is a well - defined operator in @xmath69 , and that it is essentially self - adjoint , with an absolutely continuous , non - degenerate spectrum that coincides with the real line .    to check our approximation ,",
    "we have computed numerically matrix elements of the type @xmath209 and @xmath210 for smooth wavefunctions @xmath164 , namely , gaussian profiles of the form @xmath211.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the comparison demonstrates that in fact the approximation @xmath212 is fairly good for this kind of wavefunctions , provided condition is satisfied . in fig .",
    "[ fig : toot ] we show the difference between these two types of matrix elements .",

    "furthermore , they do not depend on the chosen value of @xmath165 , but only on the studied profile , and more precisely on the value of the derivatives of order higher than one at the considered point @xmath229 ( mainly on the second derivative ) .",
    "one can check that these finite values decrease to zero when those derivatives are negligible , i.e. , when condition is satisfied . on the other hand , when increasing the value of @xmath19 at the truncation , the cumulative sums for the non - diagonal matrix elements of the difference of operators get an oscillatory behavior around a finite value , smaller than the one obtained for the corresponding diagonal matrix element .",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations is generically small and depends on the value of @xmath165 and the considered anisotropy profile , being negligible when so are @xmath230 ( for all @xmath231 ) compared with @xmath232 .    the discussed approximation for the anisotropy term , in particular , allows us to obtain a manageable form for the hamiltonian constraint of the bianchi i model , which can now be rewritten in the approximate form : @xmath233 this must be a good approximation for states in the `` high - energy '' sector of the frw - geometry  where the only relevant contributions correspond to @xmath132and whose anisotropy profile is smooth enough so as that the dominant contribution to its variation up to the scale @xmath165 is proportional to its increment at that scale .",
    "notice that , in each eigenspace of the operator @xmath160 , the eigenvalue equation of the approximate constraint obtained for bianchi i reduces to a difference equation in one dimension , coordinatized by @xmath234 . in this sense , solving that difference equation amounts to solving the constraint for the bianchi i model in our approximation .",
    "the approximate anisotropy term @xmath235 introduces a new complication in the resolution of our constraint , because @xmath207 does not have a diagonal action on the eigenstates of @xmath45 , and @xmath160 does not commute with @xmath236 .",
    "this is no fundamental obstruction in the absence of inhomogeneities , as we have commented above .",
    "however , when non - zero modes are present , we can not reduce the eigenvalue problem associated with the constraint to a manageable one - dimensional problem .",
    "nonetheless , let us recall that we are interested in regimes with small anisotropy effects .",
    "for this , we focus our discussion on physical states for which the expectation value of @xmath237 is small , and can be disregarded . on the other hand",
    ", we can adopt a similar strategy to deal with the interaction term of the constraint . since it comes multiplied by @xmath238",
    ", we can choose our profiles in @xmath57 in such a way that the expectation value of @xmath238 is also negligible , and can be ignored in comparison with the rest of contributions that arise in the constraint equation . besides we assume that , for our states , non - diagonal terms can be disregarded in @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "this must be the case for sufficiently peaked gaussian profiles ( in @xmath57 and the anisotropy momentum represented by @xmath160 ) , on which we will concentrate our attention from now on .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the reason why the anisotropy term in the hamiltonian constraint is small for this class of states is because they are peaked around a vanishing expectation value of @xmath237 , that is , they are peaked on the sector of small values of the momentum of the anisotropy variable @xmath57 .",
    "however , this does not imply by any means that those states are peaked around trajectories describing isotropic geometries . on the contrary",
    ", isotropic trajectories would be classically characterized by the relation @xmath239 , as we explained in subsec .",
    "[ sec : hgm1 ] .",
    "the states with gaussian profiles that we are considering are rather peaked around a constant value of @xmath57 , totally independent of the value of @xmath19 .",
    "even so , they provide an anisotropy contribution to the constraint that is negligible .",
    "moreover , as we have commented , we focus on the case where the constant peak value of @xmath57 is very large , so as to be able to disregard as well the term that goes with @xmath238 .    to seek for states with the desired properties , let us first carry out the spectral analysis of the operator @xmath237 .",
    "one can easily prove that @xmath237 is ( essentially ) self - adjoint .",
    "its spectrum is absolutely continuous , bounded , doubly - degenerate , and equal to the interval @xmath240 $ ] .",
    "given an eigenvalue @xmath241 , the corresponding eigenfunctions are @xmath242},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath243{\\frac{q_{\\varepsilon}^2}{16-s^{2}q_{\\varepsilon}^2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these eigenfunctions provide a resolution of the identity in @xmath244 , given by @xmath245    in the rest of our discussion , we will consider states whose anisotropy part is given by the gaussian - like profile : @xmath246{\\pi } } e^{-\\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{s}}{2q_{\\epsilon}^{2}}(\\lambda-\\bar{\\lambda})^{2}}|\\lambda\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last approximation is valid as long as @xmath247 .",
    "these states are peaked around the anisotropy value @xmath248 and around the momentum @xmath249 .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows indeed that , on the one hand , @xmath250 , as expected for gaussian - like profiles peaked around a vanishing anisotropy momentum . on the other hand , @xmath251 where @xmath82 can be any integer . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath252 , we have @xmath253 , and similarly for the dispersion : @xmath254    in conclusion , by considering states of the form given above , with a small value of the gaussian width @xmath255 and a sufficiently large value of the anisotropy peak @xmath256 , the expectation values ( with respect to the anisotropy dependence ) of both the anisotropy term and the interaction term in the hamiltonian constraint are negligible ( assuming a reasonable content of inhomogeneities ) .",
    "hence , we can approximate the constraint by the solvable one @xmath257",
    "let us now solve the constraint @xmath258 .",
    "we consider generalized states @xmath259 where @xmath260 the bra denoting a state in the corresponding dual space . we can write @xmath261 on these states the constraint @xmath262 reads @xmath263 where @xmath264 note that @xmath265 is always non - negative . solving for @xmath126 , the solutions of the constraint are states with profiles of the form @xmath266 where @xmath267 let us emphasize that the term inside the square root is non - negative , so that the solution for @xmath126 is well defined .",
    "it is now straightforward to construct approximate solutions to the hamiltonian constraint of the gowdy model . in order to do that ,",
    "let us first restrict the solutions @xmath268 so that their anisotropy dependence is given by the gaussian wavefunctions studied in the previous section : @xmath269 with [ see eq . ]",
    "@xmath270{\\pi } } e^{-\\frac{\\sigma^{2}_{s}}{2q_{\\epsilon}^{2}}(\\lambda-\\bar{\\lambda})^{2}},\\quad \\sigma^{2}_{s}\\ll \\frac{\\pi}{2},\\quad   \\bar\\lambda\\gg \\frac{q_{\\varepsilon}^2}{\\sigma^{2}_{s}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we also assume a sufficiently small content of inhomogeneities , in the sense that their interaction term can be ignored for the kind of anisotropy profiles under consideration .",
    "besides , since we want that all the introduced approximations are well justified , we need to restrict to considerably large values of @xmath126 in eq . , @xmath132 . taking into account the expression of @xmath271 and recalling that the contribution of @xmath272 is non - negative , we can guarantee that @xmath132 by restricting to scalar field momenta such that @xmath273 .",
    "once we have dealt with the hamiltonian constraint satisfactorily , we still have to impose the diffeomorphisms constraint .",
    "this last constraint restricts the numbers of particles so that @xmath274 states in the sector @xmath275 with the anisotropy profiles and a particle content that satisfies the above condition must be approximate solutions for the gowdy model ( provided that the particle interaction is not overwhelmingly large ) .",
    "we conclude by suggesting a convenient choice for the parameter @xmath194 . in principle",
    ", there is a big freedom in fixing this parameter .",
    "nonetheless , instead of doing an arbitrary choice , we are going to motivate the selection of a specific value for it employing physical arguments .",
    "the motivation comes from the fact that the homogeneous scalar field momentum is a constant of motion and provides a natural scale in the system ( in each of its generalized eigenspaces , where the approximation to the hamiltonian constraint can be carried out independently ) .",
    "we have already discussed that , if the gravitational frw contribution is only relevant in a sector @xmath173 , the optimal choice of @xmath194 would be the smallest element in @xmath195 larger than @xmath197 . as we have just seen",
    ", the momentum @xmath276 provides in fact a lower bound on @xmath126 , via eq . .",
    "hence , it seems natural to make the choice @xmath277 where @xmath278 is the point in the semilattice @xmath113 smaller but closest to the lower bound on @xmath279 , namely , @xmath280 note that , for large values of the homogeneous scalar field momentum , the parameter @xmath194 selected in this way is really small .",
    "we have studied approximation methods in the context of lqc in order to construct physical solutions of inhomogeneous and anisotropic systems . we have applied those methods to the hybrid quantization of the @xmath1 gowdy model with linear polarization and a minimally coupled massless scalar field , with the same symmetries as the spacetime metric .",
    "this model can be regarded as an frw background with anisotropies and ( matter and gravitational ) inhomogeneities propagating on it , inasmuch as the hamiltonian constraint of the system is given by the hamiltonian constraint of the frw model coupled to a homogeneous massless scalar , an anisotropy term ( which , together with the frw contribution , gives the hamiltonian constraint of the bianchi i model ) , and two inhomogeneous terms ( one gives the free energy of the inhomogeneities and the other is an interaction term ) .",
    "the last three terms are all coupled to the ( homogeneous and isotropic ) frw background .",
    "one of the main complications when trying to solve the gowdy hamiltonian constraint is the presence of the anisotropy term . on the one hand",
    ", it does not commute with the frw hamiltonian constraint . on the other hand ,",
    "its action on the anisotropy variable is quite complicated , in practice making unviable its spectral analysis .",
    "we have shown how to approximate this operator by a tensor product of two operators , one that only acts in the volume variable @xmath19 and another operator that only acts in the anisotropy label @xmath57 .",
    "the latter is a simple discrete derivative which retains the discrete effects coming from the loop quantization of the anisotropies , but with a simpler domain of definition and action than those of the original anisotropy operator . as a consequence ,",
    "the original anisotropy superselection sector splits in subspaces corresponding to states with support on equi - spaced lattices .",
    "the spectrum of the new discrete derivative operator in each of these subspaces can be characterized completely . with this characterization , and using our approximation for the anisotropy term , we obtain a hamiltonian constraint for the bianchi i model whose resolution reduces to a one - dimensional problem . in turn , we are also able to find states whose profiles in @xmath57 are sufficiently peaked , both in the anisotropy and in its momentum",
    " given by the introduced discrete derivative , as to allow us to disregard in the hamiltonian constraint not only this anisotropy term but also the contribution of the interaction term of the inhomogeneities . by considering such profiles in @xmath57 , we obtain approximate solutions to the gowdy model corresponding to states with a small quantum effect of the anisotropies and a reasonable content of inhomogeneities . the larger the momentum of the homogeneous massless scalar ( which is a constant of motion ) , the better these solutions must approximate those of the gowdy model .",
    "we leave for future research the analysis of the time evolution of the approximate solutions obtained in this work .",
    "this is not the first time that a model which behaves quantum mechanically as frw plus inhomogeneities is analyzed in the context of lqc .",
    "actually , the hybrid quantization employed here has also been applied in the quantization of frw models with cosmological perturbations @xcite .",
    "we hope that the approximation methods developed in this work can serve as well to find approximate solutions in even more realistic models , like those describing inflationary scenarios .",
