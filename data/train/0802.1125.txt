    "in band theory , it is usually taken for granted that the space inversion symmetry and the time reversal symmetry are fulfilled .",

    "the data were obtained using horizontally polarized light with a photon energy of 21.2 ev , 23 ev or 24 ev , depending on the measurement .",
    "the cophee spectrometer is equipped with two orthogonal mott polarimeters and can measure the three spatial components of the spin polarization vector for an arbitrary point in reciprocal space .",
    "the efficiency of mott polarimeters is about three orders of magnitude lower than the efficiency of common spin - integrated detectors .",
    "the acquired data typically contain around half a million counts on the intensity maxima for each scattering plane for which an accumulation time of around 5 minutes per data point is needed .",
    "the sherman function was determined to be @xmath58 .",
    "in this work we experimentally confirm that the bi / ag(111 ) and pb / ag(111 ) surface alloys exhibit a strongly enhanced rashba type spin - orbit splitting and that the spin polarization vectors can be extracted well by applying the spin analysis routines described above .",

    "<S> spin rotation is achieved by a field and momentum dependent spin splitting of bands in a two - dimensional electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> while actual devices are currently realized in semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , fundamental issues can be more easily studied in two - dimensional metallic systems involving heavy metal atoms , where spin splittings are much larger @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , a new class of material systems was identified where this effect is even further enhanced , among them the two surface alloys bi / ag(111)@xmath0 and pb / ag(111)@xmath0 @xcite , referred to as bi / ag(111 ) and pb / ag(111 ) henceforth . due to an additional reduction of the surface symmetry caused by the @xmath0 surface reconstruction and due to a slight corrugation of the surface @xcite , the size of the rashba type spin - orbit induced spin splitting is about one order of magnitude larger than what is observed for the au(111 ) surface state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + we have performed spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( sarpes ) on bi / ag(111 ) and pb / ag(111 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we present a novel two - step fitting routine for the determination of the three - dimensional spin polarization vector of individual bands , thus revealing the complete spin structure of rashba systems in momentum space . in order to illustrate our results and the power of sarpes in combination with an adequate model for the data analysis , </S>",
    "<S> this paper is arranged as follows : in the first section , the theoretical aspects of the vectorial spin analysis are outlined . in the second section some subsequently relevant physics of the studied systems </S>",
    "<S> is introduced , followed by an experimental section . in the last section , </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results are presented and discussed . </S>"
