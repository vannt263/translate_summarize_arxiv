    "topological insulators ( tis ) form a class of materials with unique properties , associated with a non - trivial topology of their quasiparticle band structure ( for a review , see refs .",
    "the key feature of two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis is the existence of special gapless edge and surface states , respectively , while the bulk states of those materials are gapped .",
    "the hallmark property of the surface states is their topological protection .",
    "mathematically , the nontrivial topological properties of time - reversal ( tr ) invariant tis are generally described @xcite by multiple copies of the @xmath0 invariants found by kane and mele @xcite .",
    "this implies that the energy band gap should close at the boundary between topological and trivial insulator ( e.g. , vacuum ) giving rise to the occurrence of the gapless interface states and the celebrated bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath0 topology in tis is as an important breakthrough because it showed that nontrivial topology can be embedded in the band structure and that the presence of an external magnetic field is not mandatory for the realization of topological phases .",
    "another distinctive feature of the 3d tis is a relativistic - like energy spectrum of the surface states , whose physical origin is related to a strong spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "indeed , the surface states on each of the surfaces are described by 2d massless dirac fermions in an irreducible 2@xmath12 representation , with a single dirac point in the reciprocal space . for comparison ,",
    "quasiparticles in graphene demonstrate similar properties , but have four inequivalent dirac cones due to a spin and valley degeneracy @xcite that makes certain aspects of their physics very different from those of the surface states in tis . in our study",
    "below , we will concentrate only on the case of the strong 3d tis whose surface states are protected by the topology of the bulk bands in combination with the tr symmetry .",
    "this leads to the locking of momenta and spin degrees of freedom and , consequently , to the formation of a helical dirac ( semi)metal state @xcite .",
    "such a state is characterized by the electron antilocalization and the absence of backscattering .",
    "the phenomenon of antilocalization has deep mathematical roots and is usually explained by an additional berry s phase @xmath2 that is acquired when an electron circles a dirac point . from the physical viewpoint ,",
    "when scattering on an impurity , an electron must change its spin in order to preserve its chirality .",
    "such a process is possible only in the case of magnetic impurities which break explicitly the tr symmetry .",
    "experimentally , a linear relativistic - like dispersion law of the surface states is observed in bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 , bi@xmath5se@xmath6 , bi@xmath5te@xmath6 , sb@xmath5te@xmath6 , bi@xmath5te@xmath5se , and other materials by using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy provide additional information about the topological nature of the surface states , such as the quasiparticles interference patterns around impurities and defects .",
    "the fourier analysis of these patterns has shown that the backscattering between @xmath7 and @xmath8 is highly suppressed in bi@xmath3sb@xmath4 @xcite and bi@xmath5te@xmath6 @xcite in accord with the tr symmetry protection .",
    "the existence of an odd number of dirac nodes leads to other exotic properties associated with surface states of tis , e.g. , an axion electromagnetic response @xcite , an unusual surface hall conductance @xcite , etc",
    ".    it is well known that electrons confined to two dimensions can form numerous interaction - induced phases . by using numerical calculations ,",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that it is energetically favorable for the 2d electron liquid in a weak magnetic field to form domains with empty and fully filled higher landau levels . depending on the number of landau levels filled , the corresponding charge density wave ( cdw ) phase is realized with a `` stripe '' or `` bubble '' pattern . by using the simplest model of the surface states in a magnetic field with strong local repulsion and",
    "a long - range coulomb interaction included perturbatively , it was suggested that a similar cdw phase with a `` stripe '' or `` bubble '' pattern can be also realized on the surface of 3d tis for supercritical values of a local repulsion constant @xcite . for subcritical local repulsion , the composite fermi liquid ( cfl ) @xcite phase",
    "is expected @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that composite fermions in conventional 2d electron gas at half - filing were recently suggested to be massless dirac ( quasi)particles @xcite similar to the surface quasiparticles of tis .",
    "this result was also checked numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that at the half - filling the particle - hole symmetry for composite fermions plays the same role as the tr symmetry for the 2d dirac fermions and , consequently , the backscattering off symmetry preserving impurities is also forbidden .",
    "the influence of an external electric field on the exciton condensation in thin films of tis was studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that the electron condensate effectively joins the surfaces of a thin film and leads to the formation of a pairing gap . however , this is important only in thin ( @xmath9 ) films of tis and can be ignored in sufficiently thick slabs @xcite .",
    "the exciton condensate exhibits unusual properties including a stable zero mode and a fractional charge @xmath10 carried by a singly quantized vortex in the exciton condensate @xcite .",
    "the dynamical gap generation in a simple model of tis was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    just like a magnetic field",
    ", an external electric field may play an important role in the dynamics of the surface states in a 3d ti slab . in this paper , we study the dynamical gap generation and the phase diagram of a ti slab placed in external magnetic and electric fields perpendicular to the slab surfaces .",
    "( note that the case of the parallel fields is rather trivial . while a parallel magnetic field does not affect the orbital motion , a parallel electric field produces a current on the surface . )",
    "we argue that a uniform phase with both dynamically generated dirac and haldane gaps is realized in sufficiently strong ( weak ) electric ( magnetic ) fields .",
    "although the explicit calculations performed in this paper use the model parameters suitable for bi@xmath5se@xmath6 , the main qualitative conclusions should be valid for all similar tis .",

    ". it is well known that there are two irreducible representations of the clifford - dirac algebra in ( 2 + 1)-dimensions , e.g. , see ref .",

    "@xcite and could play an essential role in some tis .",
    "for example , this may be the case in bi@xmath5te@xmath6 ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "1c in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , in which the band gap is about three times smaller than in bi@xmath5se@xmath6 and the trigonal potential @xmath195 is rather strong . in the case of bi@xmath5se@xmath6 , however , the hexagonal warping could be safely neglected , except for the case of rather high values of the chemical potential ( e.g. , see fig .  8 in ref .",

    "3b in ref .",
    "the model used in this study also ignores a schrodinger - like term @xmath196 , which describes an asymmetry between the electron and hole bands @xcite ( see also fig .  1 in ref .",

    "moreover , we might even suggest that , irrespective of the specific value of the coupling constants , the qualitative features established here should be rather universal .",

    "the cfl phase with the half - filled lll on each ti surface can not easily be deformed to screen out the external electric field from penetrating into the ti bulk .",

    "the cdw phase could perhaps survive when a relatively weak electric field is applied . in this case , the average charge densities on the ti surfaces , which are needed to screen the electric field out from the bulk , could be simply obtained by the formation of positive and negative stripes ( or bubbles ) of unequal size .",
    "( note that it is energetically favorable to have either completely filled or empty lll inside the stripes @xcite . ) as we showed in sec .",
    "[ sec : stripe ] , a simple estimate suggests that the charge imbalance obtained by the variation of the stripe widths can compensate only relatively weak electric fields .",
