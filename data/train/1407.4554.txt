    "in this this paper we deal with the classification of germs of curves and germs of holomorphic foliations in @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "theorems a and b ) .",
    "the problem of the classification of germs of analytic plane curves has been addressed by several authors since the xvii@xmath1 century with different methods ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in the first part of the present work , we study the problem of the analytic classification of germs of singular curves with many branches from the viewpoint of holomorphic foliations .",
    "this allows the use of geometrical techniques including the blow - up and holonomy which are related to the study of normal forms for quasi - homogeneous polynomials in two variables .",
    "next , we use the standard resolution of theses singularities in order to stratify them and thus identify the moduli space of each stratum . as a consequence",
    ", our method provides an effective way to identify if two quasi - homogeneous curves are equivalent .",
    "further , remark that the analytic type of a quasi - homogeneous curve is one of the invariants which determine the analytic type of a foliation having such a curve as separatrix set ( cf . theorem  b ) .",
    "therefore , the present classification completes the classification of such germs of complex analytic foliations .    on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of local classification of differential equations of the form @xmath2 in  two variables has been studied by various mathematicians  since the end of the nineteenth century  as c. a. briot , j. c. bouquet , h. dulac , h. poincar , i. bendixson , g. d. birkhoff , c. l. siegel , a. d. brjuno _",
    "et al_. in the middle 1970s r. thom restored the interest in this question with a series of talks at ihes .",
    "in fact , he conjectured that a germ of a foliation @xmath3 in @xmath0 with a finite number of separatrices , i.e. a finite number of analytic invariant curves through the origin , has its analytic type characterized by its holonomy with respect to the separatrix set ( cf .",

    "is proved that the conjecture has an affirmative answer if the linear part of the vector field defining the foliation is non - nilpotent . in @xcite",
    "it is proved that the conjecture is not true in general with the introduction of an analytic invariant called vanishing holonomy .",
    "further , in @xcite it is proved that any germ of a singular holomorphic foliation in @xmath0 has a nonempty separatrix set , which is denoted by @xmath4 . since this time",
    ", the problem of finding a complete set of analytic invariants determining the analytic type of a germ of a foliation in @xmath0 having a finite number of separatrices is known as thom s problem ( cf.@xcite , pp .",
    "60 , 98 ) . in @xcite",
    "the results of @xcite are generalized , classifying a zariski open subset of the nilpotent singularities in terms of the vanishing holonomy ( now called projective holonomy ) .",
    "other contributions have been given by many authors such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "in @xcite the problem of moduli space is studied from the deformation viewpoint . there",
    "it is proved that the moduli space of local unfoldings of quasi - homogeous foliations is determined by the conjugacy class of the projective holonomy and the analytic type of its separatrix set for a generic class of foliations called quasi - hyperbolic ( cf .",
    "@xcite , definition 1.1 , p. 255 ; theorem b , p. 256 ; and definition 6.8 , p. 273 ) .",
    "namely , a germ of a foliation @xmath3 is called _ quasi - hyperbolic generic _ provided that the following conditions are satisfyed : ( i ) its resolution @xmath5 has at least one non - solvable projective holonomy ; ( ii ) @xmath6 has no saddle - nodes and the ratio between the eigenvalues of each of its singular points is not a negative real number .",
    "after , in @xcite it is proved that any two quasi - hyperbolic generic quasi - homogeous foliations can be linked by such kind of unfoldings , classifying the quasi - hyperbolic generic quasi - homogeous foliations .    here , from a quite different viewpoint ,",
    "we show in the second part of this work an analogous result with less restrictive hypotheses on the foliation @xmath3 ( cf . theorem  b ) , using a geometric and much simpler proof .",
    "in fact , this geometrical approach leads also to the classification of curves .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that one of the main sources of inspiration for this work was the relationship between singular holonomies ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the analytic type of a foliation near their hopf components ( see definition below ) .",
    "furthermore , our approach can be used to understand the moduli space of more general germs of singular foliations , for instance , in the presence of saddle nodes .",
    "the plan of the article is as follows .",
    "first we determine normal forms for quasi - homogeneous algebraic curves obtaining some geometric properties for the resolution of the separatrix set . with this geometric features at hand , we determine the moduli space in terms of the moduli space of punctured riemann spheres . in the sequel ,",
    "we study the semilocal invariants of resolved foliation determining the analytic type of each hopf component of the foliation .",
    "then we introduce natural cocycles that measure the obstruction for two analytically componentwise equivalent foliations to be really analytically equivalent .",
    "finally we use the geometric description of the separatrix set in order to trivialize these cocycles and construct an explicit conjugation between two foliations with the same quasi - homogeneous curve and analytically conjugate projective holonomies .",
    "let @xmath7 be a singular curve and @xmath8 its standard resolution , i.e. the minimal resolution of @xmath7 whose _ strict transform _",
    "@xmath9  is transversal to the exceptional divisor @xmath10 . a germ of a holomorphic function @xmath11 is said to be _ quasi - homogeneous _ if there is a local system of coordinates in which @xmath12 can be represented by a quasi - homogeneous polynomial , i.e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
