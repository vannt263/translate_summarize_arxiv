    "this paper is fundamentally a survey , but we also present several basic facts that we have not found articulated elsewhere in the literature .",
    "many of these are generalizations of classical results that had previously only been formulated for specific @xmath24 and @xmath31 values .",
    "we hope that this survey will increase the circulation of basic information about fractional gaussian fields in the mathematical community .",
    "for example , the vocabulary and content of the following statements should arguably be well known to probabilists , but the authors were unaware of much of it until recently :    * in dimension @xmath32 , the gaussian field with logarithmic correlations has been used as an approximate model for the gravitational potential of the early universe ; its laplacian is a @xmath33 and has been used to model the perturbation from uniformity of the mass / energy density of the early universe . * in dimension @xmath34 , the so - called bi - laplacian field has logarithmic correlations , and its laplacian is white noise . * in any dimension , lvy brownian motion can be defined as a random continuous function whose restriction to any line has the law of a brownian motion ( modulo additive constant ) . in dimension @xmath35 , the laplacian of lvy brownian motion is the gaussian free field .",
    "we also hope that this text will be a useful reference for experts in the study of gaussian fields ; to this end , we provide a robust account of the regularity of fgf fields , the long and short range correlation formulae , conditional expectations given field values outside of fixed domains , the fourier transforms and spherical coordinate decompositions of the fgf , and various bounded - domain definitions of the fgf .",
    "the family of fractional gaussian fields includes several well - known gaussian fields such as brownian motion ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) , white noise ( @xmath38 ) , the gaussian free field ( @xmath37 ) , and the log - correlated gaussian field ( @xmath39 ) .",

    "note that @xmath62 is an affine function of @xmath31 and can be used instead of @xmath31 to parameterize the family of fgfs .",
    "we use the parameter @xmath31 in part to highlight the connection to the fractional laplacian and white noise . with our convention ,",
    "white noise is @xmath65 and the gaussian free field is @xmath66 .",
    "however , in many of our formulas and theorems @xmath62 will be the more natural parameter to use ; thus , we fix the relationship and reference both @xmath62 and @xmath31 throughout the paper .",

    "it is central to conformal field theory and liouville quantum gravity @xcite and has many connections to the schramm loewner evolution @xcite .",
    "the 2d gff is also known in the geostatistics literature as the _ de wijs process _ or the _ logarithmic variogram model _ , where it was introduced in the early 1950s to describe ore deposits @xcite .",
    "more recently , variations in crop yields have been modeled using the gff @xcite .    for all @xmath78 , the @xmath24-dimensional",
    "gff exhibits a certain markov property : for each fixed domain @xmath83 , if we are given the restriction a gff @xmath25 to @xmath84 , then the conditional law of @xmath25 restricted to @xmath85 is given by a conditionally deterministic function ( the harmonic extension of the field from @xmath86 to @xmath85 ) .",

    "namely , if we are given the restriction of @xmath25 to @xmath84 , then the conditional law of @xmath25 restricted to @xmath85 is given by a conditionally deterministic function ( the so - called * @xmath31-harmonic extension * of the field from @xmath84 to @xmath85 ) plus a random function ( the so - called * zero - boundary - condition @xmath6 on @xmath85 * ) .",
    "if @xmath88 , then the conditionally deterministic function depends on the restriction to @xmath86 of @xmath25 and its derivatives up to a certain order .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath89 is a local operator when @xmath90 .    as previously mentioned , another generalization of brownian motion is the fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .",
    "fractional brownian motion appears to have been first introduced by kolmogorov in 1940 @xcite , and the term `` fractional brownian motion '' was introduced by mandelbrot and van ness in 1968 @xcite . as motivation ,",
    "mandelbrot and van ness discuss various empirical studies of real world processes ( the price of wheat , water flowing through the nile , etc . ) that had been made by hurst , who found different scaling exponents in different settings .",
    "the definition of fractional brownian motion can be extended to describe a random function modulo additive constant on @xmath26 when @xmath91 .",
    "given @xmath17 we define the fbm ( also called the fractional brownian field ) on @xmath26 as a mean - zero gaussian process @xmath92 with covariance @xmath93 where @xmath62 is the hurst parameter of the field .",
    "we will prove in section [ sec : fbm ] that the multidimensional fractional brownian motion defined this way is equivalent to @xmath27 , where @xmath94 .    in the case",
    "@xmath95 , this multidimensional process was introduced by lvy in 1940 and is known as lvy brownian motion @xcite .",
    "general processes including multidimensional fractional brownian motion are discussed in yaglom in 1957 and by gangolli in 1967 @xcite .",
    "( gangolli gives general analytic arguments for positive definiteness of covariance kernels that apply in this case . )",
    "fractional brownian motion is studied in more detail in works of mandelbrot , as referenced in @xcite . more detailed and modern discussions of fractional brownian motion ( including topics such as excursion set theory , hausdorff dimension , hlder regularity , etc . )",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "the log - correlated gaussian field ( lgf ) is a random element @xmath25 of the space of tempered distributions modulo constants and has covariance given by @xmath76 = -\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^d}\\int_{{\\mathbb{r}}^d}\\log|x - y|\\phi_1(x)\\phi_2(y)\\,dx\\,dy,\\ ] ] in two dimensions , the lgf coincides with the gff ( up to a constant factor ) .",
    "we will see in section [ sec : whole - space ] that the @xmath24-dimensional lgf is a multiple of @xmath96 . in recent years",
    "the log - correlated gaussian field has enjoyed renewed interest because of its relationship to gaussian multiplicative chaos . for a survey article of gaussian multiplicative chaos see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lgf in @xmath97 plays an important role in early universe cosmology , where it approximately describes the gravitational potential function of the universe at a fixed time shortly after the big bang ; see @xcite for more discussion and references .",
    "another noteworthy subclass of the fractional gaussian fields is @xmath98 , which is known as the bi - laplacian gaussian field .",
    "the discrete counterpart of the bi - laplacian gaussian field is called the membrane model in physics literature ; for a mathematical point of view see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in dimension at least five",
    ", there is a natural discrete field associated with the uniform spanning forest on @xmath99 whose scaling limit is @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 processes are easiest to classify and explain when @xmath36 .",
    "we first consider @xmath100 ( so that @xmath101 ) , in which case the @xmath102 is a gaussian random function @xmath103 which we interpret as being defined modulo an additive constant .",

    ", it is clear that if an @xmath102 , for @xmath112 $ ] , is defined modulo additive constant in a translation invariant way , then the distributional derivatives @xmath109 , @xmath113 , etc .",

    "the following proposition , rephrased and proved as theorem  [ thm : restriction ] in section  [ sec : restriction ] , is one reason that the one - dimensional case is significant .    if @xmath117 , then the restriction of the @xmath24-dimensional fgf with hurst parameter @xmath62 ( i.e. , with @xmath118 ) to any fixed @xmath20-dimensional subspace ( with @xmath119 ) is a @xmath20-dimensional fgf with hurst parameter @xmath62 ( up to multiplicative constant ) .",
    "the gaussian free field @xmath66 can be approximated by the discrete gaussian free field , which only has nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "this discrete markov property gives rise to the domain markov property of the gaussian free field in the limit @xcite . in section [ sec : dfgf ] , we construct a discrete version of @xmath6 for @xmath120 by introducing a discrete fractional gradient to play the role of the discrete gradient in the definition of the discrete gff .",
    "the fractional gradient involves long range interactions , which may be viewed as the reason that the markov property fails for @xmath6 when @xmath31 is not an integer .",
    "the comparison between the short range @xmath27 ( when @xmath121 ) and the long range @xmath27 ( when @xmath122 ) may also be seen from the point of view of the corresponding potential theories . as an illustration , consider gff and @xmath6 for @xmath123 .",

    "the laplacian is a local differential operator , while @xmath126 for @xmath127 is a non - local pseudo - differential operator and @xmath128 depends on the values of @xmath129 for all @xmath130 .",
    "another way to see the distinction between the @xmath37 and @xmath131 cases is to recall that the green s function for the dirichlet laplacian is given by the density of the occupation measure of a brownian motion ( see @xcite , for example ) , which is continuous .",
