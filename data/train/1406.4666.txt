    "the spatial splitting of cooper pairs has been demonstrated experimentally from an analysis of the cps average currents , current noise and current cross - correlations@xcite . however , new tools appear to be necessary to investigate further the cps dynamics , and in particular its coherence , which has not been demonstrated experimentally so far@xcite .",
    "this coherence has two intimately related aspects : the coherence of cooper pair injection and the conservation of spin - entanglement .",
    "the first aspect is due to the fact that cooper pair injection into the cps is a coherent crossed andreev process , which produces a coherent coupling between the initial and final states of the cooper pair in the superconducting contact and the cps ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "photon emission in the cavity / nanoconductor resonant regime has received the most attention so far . in contrast , this work considers a cps and a cavity coupled non - resonantly , so that the cps simply causes a cavity frequency pull .",
    "when the cps is excited with a microwave voltage , the cavity frequency pull displays an anticrossing which can be attributed unambigously to coherent cooper pair injection , due to various specificities related to the transport geometry and the symmetries of the split singlet cooper pairs .",

    "<S> this work discusses theoretically the behavior of a microwave cavity and a cooper pair beam splitter ( cps ) coupled non - resonantly . </S>",
    "<S> the cavity frequency pull is modified when the cps is resonant with a microwave excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a direct way to probe the coherence of the cooper pair splitting process . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , the cavity frequency pull displays an anticrossing whose specificities can be attributed unambiguously to coherent cooper pair injection . </S>",
    "<S> this work illustrates that microwave cavities represent a powerful tool to investigate current transport in complex nanocircuits . </S>"
