    "qubit state preparation begins with optical pumping to the state using circularly ( @xmath22 ) polarized 397  light , containing two frequencies close to resonance with the @xmath57 and @xmath58 transitions .",
    "the fidelity of the optical pumping is limited by imperfect polarization , leaving population in ( predominantly ) ground level @xmath59 and @xmath60 states .",
    "we use a microwave technique to reduce this error : after clearing out the states with a pulse of single - frequency 397  @xmath61 light on the @xmath57 transition , we apply microwave @xmath24-pulses on the @xmath62 and @xmath63 transitions , followed by another 397  @xmath61 pulse to clear out .",
    "the sequence of microwave and clear - out pulses can be repeated as often as necessary . from the spam experiments described in the following section",
    ", we estimate that this sequence prepares the state with @xmath64 error",
    ". the robustness of this technique against polarization imperfections may be especially useful in microfabricated traps incorporating miniaturized integrated optics .",
    "in the paper we describe an experiment to determine the combined state preparation and measurement ( spam ) error , consisting of the following steps : ( 1 ) microwave - enhanced optical pumping to the state ; ( 2 ) three ( or four ) microwave @xmath24-pulses to transfer the ion to the ( or ) qubit state ; ( 3 ) four microwave @xmath24-pulses which transfer population from to @xmath65 and from to @xmath66 ; ( 4 ) `` shelving '' optical pumping pulses to transfer population from @xmath67 to the metastable 3@xmath68 level ; ( 5 ) time - resolved fluorescence detection to determine whether the ion is shelved . table i gives a breakdown of the measured spam error into contributions from each of these operations .",
    "the fluorescence detection error ( 5 ) was calculated by monte carlo simulations using the measured ion fluorescence and background signals , which in our previous experiments using showed agreement at the @xmath69 level  @xcite .",
    "tests with in this apparatus showed similar agreement .",
    "drift in experimental conditions ( _ e.g. _  the fluorescence signal ) increase this error , so the quoted value is a lower bound , but we estimate such effects are at or below the @xmath69 level .    the shelving error ( 4 ) was estimated from a rate equation simulation  @xcite . in this simulation",
    "@xcite we assumed that all laser detunings , intensities and polarizations were set to their intended values , with the exception of the 393  intensity .",
    "we calibrated the 393  intensity by measuring the rates at which population was pumped out of the and states by the 393  laser .",
    "we found that the pumping rate from was 15% greater than that expected from the pumping rate measured for .",
    "( this discrepancy could be explained by a broadening of the 393  transition , for example due to thermal motion of the ion , or by spectral impurities in the laser . )",
    "we used these measured rates in the shelving simulation , resulting in an estimated error somewhat higher than the minimum theoretically attainable .    to place a limit on the preparation error ( 1 )",
    ", we also measured the error in preparing and reading out this state .",
    "this experiment was equivalent to the qubit state measurement with the microwave pulses ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) removed .",
    "we measured an error of @xmath70 , which is consistent with the sum of the errors calculated for this state for the shelving transfer ( @xmath71 ) and the fluorescence detection ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this result suggests firstly that the shelving and fluorescence detection errors were not significantly greater than their simulated values ; and secondly that the error in preparing the state was comparable with or smaller than the measurement s uncertainty .",
    "( due to the large zeeman splittings introduced by the 146  magnetic field , all ground level states other than have a probability of @xmath73 of being shelved  @xcite ; we thus measure the population in the state , rather than the total population in the @xmath74 manifold , as would be the case at low magnetic fields . )",
    "we take @xmath75 as a conservative upper limit for the preparation error .",
    "we attribute the remainder of the measured spam error to the microwave @xmath24-pulses , apportioning it equally between the microwave preparation pulses ( 2 ) and the microwave readout pulses ( 3 ) .",
    "the average error of @xmath76 per pulse is consistent with numerical simulations taking into account off - resonant excitation of spectator transitions and the effect of magnetic field noise ( @xmath77 ) on the field - sensitive transitions  @xcite .",
    "we describe briefly the phase - agile microwave drive system used for the single - qubit randomized benchmarking experiments ; further details are given in  @xcite .",
    "the microwaves were generated by a frequency - octupled direct digital synthesizer ( dds ) running at 400 , referenced to a rubidium frequency standard .",
    "the dds was programmed with four different phases , so as to generate microwaves with four 90-separated phases to drive @xmath17 rotations about @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes ; the phase was switched during the dead time ( 14 ) between @xmath17-pulses .",
    "the dds and octupler were run continuously and at a constant power level to minimize effects of experimental duty cycle .",
    "a pair of high - isolation switches in series was used to produce nominally rectangular pulses , which were fed to one of the trap s axial electrodes via a circulator and filters as indicated in figure  1a in the paper .",
    "the nominal extinction of the switches was 60  each , and the microwave frequency was detuned by @xmath78 from the qubit transition which further reduced the effects of any leakage .",
    "the dds amplitude was set to produce a @xmath17-pulse duration of 12.1  and periodically calibrated using a sequence of 751 @xmath17-pulses . at the input to the trap ,",
    "the microwave power was approximately 0.1 .",
    "in this section we consider the three sources of error in the single - qubit randomized benchmarking experiment listed in table i : ( 1 ) microwave detuning from the qubit transition ; ( 2 ) incorrect microwave @xmath17-pulse area ; ( 3 ) off - resonant effects due to spectator transitions in the ground level .",
    "a more detailed error analysis for this experiment may be found in  @xcite , which considers the following additional sources of error : qubit dephasing , microwave phase and amplitude noise , pulse length jitter , microwave - ion coupling fluctuations , microwave and laser leakage , ion heating and effects of microwave duty cycle .",
    "these are all estimated to be insignificant compared with the errors considered here .",
    "our method is as follows .",
    "we simulate the error for a given sequence of gates by calculating a propagator describing each ( imperfect ) @xmath17-pulse and 14  inter - pulse dead time in the sequence .",
    "these are multiplied together to create a sequence propagator , from which the expected error for that sequence may be calculated . by averaging over the particular sequences used in the benchmarking experiment ,",
    "we calculate the expected average error per gate ( epg ) . for simplicity , we consider only the longest sequences used ( 2000 computational gates ) , as the final result is most sensitive to these runs . to verify the simulations , we performed additional randomized benchmarking experiments in which we introduced intentional microwave detuning and pulse area errors .",
    "figure  [ f : freqerr ] shows the simulated and measured epg as a function of the microwave detuning from the qubit transition .",
    "the measured results are in good agreement with the simulations .",
    "we performed simulations both with and without experimental dead time , demonstrating that the dead time makes the experiment significantly more sensitive to detuning error . due to the presence of off - resonant spectator transitions which couple to the qubit states",
    ", there is an a.c .",
    "zeeman shift of the qubit transition which we calculate to be @xmath79 at our rabi frequency of @xmath80 .",
    "for the experiments reported in the paper , the microwave detuning was @xmath78 ; the a.c .",
    "zeeman shift increases this to @xmath81 during the @xmath17-pulses . including this effect , the simulated epg is @xmath82 .    .",
    "including the effect of the a.c .",
    "zeeman shift makes negligible difference to the simulated epg on this scale . ]",
    "figure  [ f : amperr ] shows the simulated and measured epg as a function of rabi frequency for fixed pulse duration .",
    "again , we find good agreement between measurement and simulation . for the experiments reported in the paper , we periodically recalibrated the microwave amplitude during the randomized benchmarking experiments .",
    "based on the required changes to the dds amplitude at each recalibration , we estimate that the microwave rabi frequency drifted by @xmath83 between calibrations .",
    "we attribute this to slow drift due to thermal effects in the microwave system , which we model as a constant rabi frequency offset , giving an epg contribution of @xmath84 .    -pulse area error ( varied by changing the rabi frequency , while keeping the pulse duration fixed ) .",
    "we simulate both microwaves resonant with the qubit transition ( dashed curve ) and microwaves with the @xmath85  detuning used in the main experiment ( solid curve ) .",
    "these measurements were also taken with a @xmath85  detuning , used 2000-gate sequences , and have been corrected for spam error . ]    since the microwave field used to drive the qubit transition was not purely @xmath61 polarized , it also couples off - resonantly to other ground - level transitions .",
    "in addition to the a.c .",
    "zeeman shift of the qubit transition discussed above , this also leads to rabi flopping on these spectator transitions with a small amplitude @xmath86 for the zeeman splittings @xmath87 at 146 . to calculate the error due to off - resonant rabi - flopping",
    ", we simulated the randomized benchmarking experiment including the full 16-state ground level and the known microwave polarization ( measured in separate experiments ) .",
    "this simulation gives an error @xmath88 , confirming the rough estimate above .",
    "randomized benchmarking aims to determine the mean epg averaged over all possible pulse sequences . in practice , of course , only a finite number of randomly - chosen sequences can be tested : in the experiments reported in the paper , we used 32 sequences for each different sequence length . to confirm that this was a sufficient level of randomization to provide an accurate estimate of the mean epg , we performed our simulation of the experiment on 500 different sets of 32 random sequences , each consisting of 2000 computational gates .",
    "these simulations assumed the nominal conditions of the experiment ( neglecting off - resonant effects ) .",
    "a histogram of the simulated epgs is shown in figure  [ f : rbmsampling ] : the standard deviation of the results is a factor of two smaller than the uncertainty in our measured epg , implying that this level of randomization is sufficient .",
    "the particular set of sequences we used in our experiment lies about @xmath89 above the mean , suggesting that it has above - average sensitivity to known experimental imperfections .     and a constant rabi frequency error of @xmath90 .",
    "the black curve is the best fit normal distribution , with mean @xmath91 and standard deviation @xmath92 .",
    "the dashed line shows the simulated epg for the particular set of sequences used in our experiment . ]",
