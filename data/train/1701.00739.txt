    "the origin of magnetic fields in massive stars is still poorly known .",
    "many authors argued that magnetic fields could be fossil , or it may be generated by a strong binary interaction in stellar mergers , or during a mass transfer or common envelope evolution .",
    "the answers to questions related to the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in massive stars require therefore additional efforts in this field .",
    "as the most convenient characteristic of the stellar magnetic field we use the _ rms _ magnetic field @xmath1 where we sum over all measured values of mean longitudinal magnetic fields @xmath2 for a given star .",
    "here @xmath3 is the running number of the individual observation , @xmath4 is the total number of observations .",
    "@xcite showed that in the case of dipole field configuration the _ rms _ field value @xmath5 depends weakly on the rotational phase @xmath6 of observations , the rotation axis inclination angle @xmath7 , and the angle @xmath8 between the rotational axis and the axis of magnetic dipole .",
    "this conclusion holds for quadrupole and other field configurations . as a measure of reality of the measured field values we use the criterion  ( 4 ) presented by  @xcite",
    "this criterion is equivalent to the condition that the absolute value of the measured magnetic field @xmath9 is 3 or more times larger than the error of the measurements at least for one field measurement .",
    "the analysis of a differential magnetic field distribution @xmath10 ( the magnetic field function ) introduced by  @xcite is important for understanding the origin of stellar magnetic fields .",
    "the function @xmath10 is defined as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of stars in the interval @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the total number of stars with real measured _ rms _ field @xmath5 . at present , only for about one dozen of o - type stars the presence of a magnetic field is confirmed using high- and low - resolution spectropolarimetry . for remaining 10 stars",
    "the presence of a weak magnetic field is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the calculated by us function @xmath15 for all o stars with measured magnetic fields , including data by @xcite is given in fig .",
    "[ fig.mfdistrobastars ] ( left panel ) and can be fitted with a power law @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 for @xmath19 g . the magnetic field function @xmath15 for ba stars was also fitted with a power law by @xcite for @xmath20 .",
    "they obtained @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "it means that the average magnetic fields of o - type stars are @xmath23 times weaker than those for ba stars .    at @xmath24",
    "the magnetic field function greatly reduced relative to the power law .",
    "the relatively small number of stars with @xmath24 was interpreted by @xcite as an evidence of the _ magnetic desert _ in this field region as a result of the bifurcation between stable and unstable large scale magnetic field configurations .    to clarify this issue we calculated the magnetic field distribution function using all suitable data from the catalogue by  @xcite .",
    "we fit the magnetic field distribution by log ",
    "normal law instead of a power one .",
    "the result of our fit is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.mfdistrobastars ] ( right panel ) .",
    "we do not see the _ magnetic desert _ at least for ba stars .",
    "the number of measured magnetic fields for o stars is to small to check if the log  normal law is better than the power one for these stars .",
    "recently @xcite created the histogram of the distribution of the dipolar magnetic field strength for the magnetic massive stars using their new measurements and did not detected the _",
    "magnetic desert _ for intermediate - mass stars .",
    "they argued that the relatively weak fields might be more common than currently observed .",
    "the population synthesis model of the magnetic field evolution for o and ba stars @xcite showed that the present - day distribution of the magnetic fields of oba stars can be reproduced assuming that the initial magnetic field distribution at the zams obeys the log  normal law . for the sake of convenience",
    "the authors used the magnetic fluxes @xmath25 for stars with known values of @xmath26 instead of their magnetic fields .",
    "all obtained initial distributions of the magnetic fluxes at zams were also fitted with log  normal law .",
    "recently medvedev & kholtygin ( 2016 , this issue ) show that parameters of the initial magnetic flux distribution can be chosen the same both for o and ba stars .",
    "the mean logarithm of the initial magnetic fluxes at zams for all oba stars in the model without magnetic field dissipation ( model i ) is @xmath27 with the standard deviation @xmath28 , while for model ii with a dissipation time @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the star lifitime star on the  ms .",
    "the nature of the log  normal distribution of magnetic fluxes for ob and ba stars is enigmatic . to explain this we can use the main idea by  @xcite that mergers of protostars might play an important role in the formation of magnetic field of massive stars .",
    "developing this idea , we assume that the magnetic field is not formed in a final merging of the protostars , but in multiple merging events of protostars and planetesimals .",
    "suppose that there was @xmath14 cycles of merging before zams and after act @xmath7 of merging the magnetic flux of star @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the coefficient of the field amplification and @xmath35 is the stellar magnetic flux at the cycle @xmath36 .",
    "the amplification coefficients are supposed to be uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath37 $ ] , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are constant .",
    "the initial magnetic flux @xmath40 supposed to be identical for all stars . in fig .",
    "[ fig.nflux_zams ] we demonstrate the result of our modeling of the magnetic flux distribution at zams .",
    "we fixed a value @xmath41 and fitted the parameters @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath42 only .",
    "the obtained optimal parameters are @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45g@xmath46 for model i and @xmath43 , @xmath47 , @xmath48g@xmath46 for model ii . the total field amplification ratio @xmath49 and @xmath50 for models i and ii respectively .",
    "we show that the magnetic filed distribution for early ba - type stars can be described with the log  normal law .",
    "this means , in particular , the absence of a magnetic desert at least for early - type stars . from our considerations",
    "we can conclude that multiple dynamo action during merging of protostars and planetesimals can be responsible for the generation of magnetic fields before the ms .              , l. , castro , n. , morel , t. , langer , n. , briquet , m. , carroll , t.  a. , hubrig , s. , nieva , m.  f. , oskinova , l.  m. , przybilla , n. , schneider , f.  r.  n. , schller , m. , simn - daz , s. , ilyin , i. , de koter , a. , reisenegger , a. , & sana , h. 2015 , , 574 , a20 .",
