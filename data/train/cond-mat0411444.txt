    "the quest for a better understanding of the influence of the electron spin on the charge transport in nonmagnetic semiconductor nanostructures has considerably attracted interest during recent years.@xcite spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) is considered as a possibility to control and manipulate electron states via gate voltages.@xcite this has generated considerable research activity , both in theory and experiment , motivated by fundamental physics as well as applicational aspects .",
    "especially , soi induced by the rashba effect@xcite in semiconductor heterostructures as a consequence of the lack of structure inversion symmetry@xcite is important . in these two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems",
    "the rashba effect leads to spin precession of the propagating electrons .",
    "the possibility to manipulate the strength of the rashba effect by an external gate voltage has been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "@xcite this is the basis of the spin dependent field - effect - transistor ( spinfet ) earlier discussed theoretically by datta and das.@xcite numerous theoretical spintronic devices have been proposed using interference , @xcite resonant tunneling , @xcite ferromagnet - semiconductor hybrid structures , @xcite multiterminal geometries , @xcite and adiabatic pumping.@xcite magnetic field effects on the transport properties in 2d systems with soi have been investigated theoretically @xcite as well as experimentally @xcite .    in order to improve the efficiency of the spinfet the angular distribution of spin precessing electrons has to be restricted.@xcite thus",
    ", the interplay of soi and quantum confinement in quasi-1d systems@xcite and quantum hall edge channels@xcite has been studied .",
    "first experimental results on soi in quantum wires have been obtained.@xcite the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field has been suggested to relax the conditions for the external confining potential for quantum point contacts . in these systems a zeeman - like spin splitting at @xmath1 has been predicted from the results of numerical calculations when simultaneously soi and a magnetic field are present.@xcite the effect of an in - plane magnetic field on the electron transport in quasi-1d systems has also been calculated.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on the spectral and spin properties of a ballistic quantum wire with rashba spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the results are twofold .",
    "first , we show that transforming the one - electron model to a bosonic representation yields a systematic insight into the effect of the soi in quantum wires , by using similarities to atom - light interaction in quantum optics for high magnetic fields .",
    "second , we demonstrate that spectral and spin properties can be systematically understood from the symmetry properties . without magnetic field",
    "the system has a characteristic symmetry property  the invariance against a combined spin orbital - parity transformation  which is related to the presence of the soi .",
    "this leads to the well - known degeneracy of energies at @xmath1 .",
    "the eigenvalue of this symmetry transformation replaces the spin quantum number .",
    "a non - zero magnetic field breaks this symmetry and lifts the degeneracy .",
    "this magnetic field - induced energy splitting at @xmath1 can become much larger than the zeeman splitting .",
    "in addition , we show that modifications of the one - electron spectrum due to the presence of the soi are very sensitive to weak magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , we find characteristic hybridisation effects in the spin density .",
    "both results are completely general as they are related to the breaking of the combined spin - parity symmetry .",
    "this general argument explains the zeeman - like splitting observed in recent numerical results.@xcite",
    "we study a quasi-1d quantum wire with soi in a perpendicular magnetic field . the system is assumed to be generated in a 2d electron gas ( 2deg ) by means of a gate - voltage induced parabolic lateral confining potential .",
    "we assume that the soi is dominated by structural inversion asymmetry .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for inas based 2degs.@xcite therefore , the soi is modelled by the rashba hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath2_z,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the effective mass and land factor of the electron , and @xmath5 is the vector of the pauli matrices .",
    "the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath6-direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] ) , and the vector potential @xmath7 is in the landau gauge .",
    "three length scales characterise the relative strengths in the interplay of confinement , magnetic field @xmath8 , and soi , @xmath9 the length scale @xmath10 corresponds to the confinement potential @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the magnetic length with @xmath13 the cyclotron frequency and @xmath14 is the length scale associated with the soi . in a 2deg the latter is connected to a spin precession phase @xmath15 if the electron propagates a distance @xmath16 .    because of the translational invariance in the @xmath17-direction the eigenfunctions can be decomposed into a plain wave in the longitudinal direction and a spinor which depends only on the transversal coordinate @xmath18 , @xmath19 with this and by defining creation and annihilation operators of a shifted harmonic oscillator , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which describe the quasi-1d subbands in the case without soi , the transversal wavefunction component satisfies @xmath22 for @xmath23 fixed with the hamiltonian @xmath24 the abbreviations @xmath25 and the dimensionless zeeman splitting @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the bare mass of the electron ) .",
    "this representation of the hamiltonian corresponds to expressing the transverse wavefunction in terms of oscillator eigenstates such that @xmath28 gives the subband index of the electron which propagate with longitudinal momentum @xmath29 .",
    "the magnetic field leads to the lateral shift of the wavefunction and the renormalisation of the oscillator frequency @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the effective mass in the kinetic energy of the longitudinal propagation is changed . the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) describes how the soi couples the electron s orbital degree of freedom to its spin . due to the operators @xmath31 and @xmath21 the subbands corresponding to one spin branch are coupled to the same and nearest neighboring subbands of opposite spin , see fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]a .    formally , for @xmath23 fixed eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) can be regarded as a simple spin - boson system where the spin of the electron is coupled to a mono - energetic boson field which represents the transverse orbital subbands .",
    "this interpretation leads to an analogy to the atom - light interaction in quantum optics . there",
    ", the quantised bosonic radiation field is coupled to a pseudo - spin that approximates the two atomic levels between which electric dipol transitions occur . in our model ,",
    "the roles of atomic pseudo - spin and light field are played by the spin and the orbital transverse modes of the electron , respectively .",
    "indeed , in the limit of a strong magnetic field , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 eq .  ( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) converges against the exactly integrable jayne - cummings model ( jcm),@xcite @xmath34 this system is well known in quantum optics .",
    "it is one of the most simple models to couple a boson mode and a two - level system.@xcite in the case of the quantum wire with soi one can show that in the strong magnetic field limit the rotating - wave approximation,@xcite wich leads to the jcm , becomes exact .",
    "this is because for @xmath35 and @xmath36 the electrons are strongly localised near the center of the quantum wire and thus insensitive to the confining potential . in this limit",
    ", there is a crossover to the 2d electron system with soi in perpendicular magnetic field for which the formal identity to the jcm has been asserted previously.@xcite    in this context , it is important to note that the jcm is known to exhibit rabi oscillations in optical systems with atomic pseudo - spin and light field periodically exchanging excitations .",
    "recently , an experimentally feasible scheme for the production of coherent oscillations in a single few - electron quantum dot with soi has been proposed@xcite with the electron s spin and orbital angular momentum exchanging excitation energy .",
    "this highlights the general usefulness of mapping parabolically confined systems with soi onto a bosonic representation as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) .",
    "related results have been found in a 3d model in nuclear physics where the soi leads to a _ spin - orbit pendulum _",
    "without magnetic field it has been pointed out previously that one effect of soi in 2d is that no common axis of spin quantisation can be found , see e.g.  ref.@xcite . since the soi is proportional to the momentum it lifts spin degeneracy only for @xmath37 . from the degeneracy at @xmath0",
    "a new binary quantum number can be expected at @xmath38 .",
    "it can easily be shown that for any symmetric confinement potential @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] )  which includes the 2d case for @xmath40 or symmetric multi - terminal junctions@xcite  the hamiltonian is invariant under the unitary transformation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the inversion operator for the @xmath18-component , @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the observables @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 commute pairwise . without soi , @xmath47 and @xmath48",
    "are conserved separately . with soi",
    ", both operators are combined to form the new constant of motion @xmath46 which is called _",
    "spin parity_. when introducing a magnetic field with a non - zero perpendicular component the spin parity symmetry is broken and we expect the degeneracy at @xmath0 to be lifted . as a side remark , by using oscillator eigenstates and the representation of eigenstates of @xmath49 for the spinor , the hamiltonian @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) becomes real and symmetric .",
    "we point out that in this choice of basis the transformation @xmath51 is a representation of the time - reversal operation which for @xmath38 also commutes with @xmath44 .",
    "however , it does not commute with @xmath45 and no further quantum number can be derived from @xmath52.@xcite the effect of the symmetry @xmath46 on the transmission through symmetric four@xcite and three - terminal@xcite devices has been studied previously .",
    "we recall that the orbital effect of the magnetic field leads to a twofold symmetry breaking : the breaking of the spin parity @xmath46 lifts the @xmath0 degeneracy ( even without the zeeman effect ) and the breaking of time - reversal symmetry lifts the kramers degeneracy .",
    "for @xmath38 we can attribute the quantum numbers @xmath53 to an eigenstate where @xmath54 is the subband index corresponding to the quantisation of motion in @xmath18-direction and @xmath55 is the quantum number of spin parity . for @xmath56 , due to the breaking of spin parity , @xmath54 and @xmath57 merge into a new quantum number leading to the nonconstant energy splitting at @xmath0 which will be addressed in the next section when treating the spectral properties .",
    "for weak soi ( @xmath58 ) one finds in second order that the spin splitting at @xmath0 for the @xmath54th subband is @xmath59 where @xmath60 $ ] . the first term is the bare zeeman splitting and the soi - induced second contribution has the peculiar property of being proportional to the subband index .",
    "in addition , for weak magnetic field ( @xmath61 ) the splitting is proportional @xmath8 , @xmath62 this is expected because by breaking the spin parity symmetry at non - zero @xmath8 the formerly degenerate levels can be regarded as a coupled two - level system for which it is known that the splitting into hybridised energies is proportional to the coupling , i.e.  the magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "due to the complexity of the coupling between spin and subbands in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) , apart from some trivial limits , no analytic solution of the schrdinger equation can be expected .",
    "we find the eigenfunctions and energies of the hamiltonian by exact numerical diagonalisation .",
    "figures [ fig : exact]b  d show the spectra for different strengths of magnetic field and parameters typical for inas : @xmath63vm , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "we set @xmath66 which corresponds to a wire width @xmath67 nm .",
    "for the case without magnetic field it has been asserted previously that the interplay of soi and confinement leads to strong spectral changes like non - parabolicities and anticrossings when @xmath14 becomes comparable to @xmath10.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]b we find similar results in the limit of a weak magnetic field . however , as an effect of non - vanishing magnetic field we observe a splitting of the formerly spin degenerate energies at @xmath1 . for the zeeman effect",
    "it is expected that the corresponding spin splitting is constant .",
    "in contrast , in fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]b  d the splitting at @xmath1 depends on the subband .",
    "this additional splitting has been predicted in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetry ] in terms of a symmetry breaking effect when soi and perpendicular magnetic field are simultaneously present .",
    "figure [ fig : splitting2]a shows the eigenenergies @xmath68 for @xmath66 as a function of magnetic field in units of hybridised energies , @xmath69 .",
    "three different regimes can be distinguished .",
    "( i )  for small magnetic field ( @xmath70 ) the energy splitting evolves from the spin degenerate case ( triangles ) due to the breaking of spin parity . although the perturbative results eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) can not be applied to the case @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting2]a , the energy splitting at small magnetic field and the overall increasing separation for higher subbands are reminiscent of the linear dependences on @xmath54 and @xmath8 found in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) and ( [ eq : delta2 ] ) . ( ii )  for @xmath71 ,",
    "the energy splitting is comparable to the subband separation which indicates the merging of the quantum numbers of the subband and the spin parity into a new major quantum number . for higher subbands , the soi - induced splitting even leads to anticrossings with neighboring subbands .",
    "( iii )  finally , the convergence to the jcm implies that the splittings should saturate for large @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]d ) . the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting2]a show the energies of the spin - split landau levels , @xmath72 for @xmath73 , indicating that the soi - induced energy splitting is always larger than the bulk zeeman splitting . at @xmath74",
    "the soi - induced splitting exceeds the zeeman effect by a factor 5 .",
    "this is remarkable because of the large value of the @xmath4-factor in inas .    for our wire parameters the sweep in fig .  [ fig : splitting2]a corresponds to a magnetic field @xmath75 t . considering the significant spectral changes due to breaking of spin parity at @xmath76 ( @xmath77mt )",
    "we conclude that the soi - induced modifications in the wire subband structure are very sensitive to weak magnetic fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]b , c ) .",
    "this may have consequences for spinfet designs that rely on spin polarised injection from ferromagnetic leads because stray fields can be expected to alter the transmission probabilities of the interface region .",
    "the soi - induced enhancement of the spin splitting should be accessable via optical resonance or ballistic transport experiments . in a quasi-1d constriction",
    "the conductance is quantised in units of @xmath78 where @xmath54 is the number of transmitting channels.@xcite in the following , we neglect the influence of the geometrical shape of the constriction and that for small magnetic fields ( @xmath79 ) the minima of the lowest subbands are not located at @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]b ) . in this simplified model",
    "we expect the conductance @xmath80 to jump up one conductance quantum every time the fermi energy passes through the minimum of a subband .",
    "thus , in the case of spin degenerate subbands , @xmath80 increases in steps with heights @xmath81 ( triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting2]b ) .    in principle , by sweeping the magnetic field the different regimes discussed in fig .  [ fig : splitting2]a can be distinguished in the ballistic conductance .",
    "for high magnetic field , the spin degeneracy is broken due to the zeeman effect .",
    "this leads to a sequence of large steps ( landau level separation ) interrupted by small steps ( spin splitting ) ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting2]b ) . as a signature of the soi we expect increasing spin splitting for higher landau levels due to converging towards the jcm ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]d ) .",
    "decreasing the magnetic field enhances the effects of soi until at @xmath76 subband and spin splitting are comparable whereas the zeeman effect becomes negligible ( crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig : splitting2]b ) .",
    "not only the energy spectra of the quantum wire are strongly affected by the breaking the spin parity @xmath82 .",
    "the latter symmetry has also profound consequences for the spin density , @xmath83 to elucidate this in some detail we start with considering the case @xmath38 .      without magnetic field ,",
    "the spin parity is a constant of motion .",
    "the corresponding symmetry operation eq .",
    "( [ eq : spinparity ] ) leads to the symmetry property for the wavefunction , @xmath84 where @xmath57 denotes the quantum number of the spin parity .",
    "this symmetry requires the spin density components perpendicular to the confinement to be antisymmetric , @xmath85 , leading to vanishing spin expectation values , @xmath86 .",
    "we note that using the @xmath49-representation for spinors even leads to zero longitudinal spin _ density _",
    "@xmath87 because the real and symmetric hamiltonian @xmath50 implies _ real _ transverse wavefunctions independent of the spin parity .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to consider the @xmath18- and @xmath6-components of the spin , only .    for zero magnetic field ,",
    "it has been pointed out that for large @xmath23 the spin is approximately quantised in the confinement direction.@xcite this is due to the so - called _ longitudinal - soi approximation_@xcite which becomes valid when the term linear in @xmath23 in the soi [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : spin - boson ] ) ] exceeds the coupling to the neighboring subbands .",
    "the perpendicular magnetic field breaks spin parity and thereby leads to a hybridisation of formerly degenerate states for small @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , the breaking of the symmetry of the wavefunction eq .",
    "( [ eq : onsager ] ) leads to modifications of the spin density .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmaexp ] the expectation value of spin is shown as a function of the longitudinal momentum for the two lowest subbands .    for weak magnetic field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmaexp]a ) results similar to the zero magnetic field case@xcite are found . for large @xmath23 the spinor",
    "is effectively described by eigenstates of @xmath48 which concurs with the longitudinal - soi approximation . however , for @xmath88 the hybridisation of the wavefunction leads to a finite value of @xmath89 .",
    "this corresponds to the emergence of the energy splitting at @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : exact]b which can be regarded as an additional effective zeeman splitting that tilts the spin into the @xmath49-direction  even without a real zeeman effect .",

    "[ fig : sigmaexp ] depend only marginally on the strength of the zeeman effect .",
    "no qualitative difference is found for @xmath90 .",
    "in summary , the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field on a quasi-1d electron system with rashba effect is investigated .",
    "it is shown that the spectral and spin features of the system for small @xmath23 are governed by a compound spin orbital - parity symmetry of the wire . without magnetic field",
    "this _ spin parity _ is a characteristic property of symmetrically confined systems with rashba effect and leads to a new binary quantum number which replaces the quantum number of spin .",
    "this symmetry is also responsible for the well - known degeneracy for @xmath0 in systems with rashba effect .",
    "a non - zero magnetic field breaks the spin - parity symmetry and lifts the corresponding degeneracy , thus leading to a novel magnetic field induced energy splitting at @xmath0 which can become much larger than the zeeman splitting .",
    "moreover , we find that the breaking of the symmetry leads to hybridisation effects in the spin density .",
    "the one - electron spectrum is shown to be very sensitive to weak magnetic fields .",
    "spin - orbit interaction induced modifications of the subband structure are strongly changed when the magnetic length becomes comparable to the lateral confinement of the wire .",
