    "the nearest stars have received renewed scrutiny because of their importance to fundamental astrophysics ( _ e.g. _ , stellar atmospheres , the mass content of the galaxy ) and because of their potential for harboring planetary systems and life ( _ e.g. _ , the nasa origins and astrobiology initiatives ) .",
    "the smallest stars , the m dwarfs , account for at least 70% of all stars in the solar neighborhood and make up nearly half of the galaxy s total stellar mass ( henry _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; hereafter h97 ) .",
    "their slightly lesser cousins , the brown dwarfs , may lurk in comparable numbers . yet , many of the nearest red , brown , and white dwarfs remain unrecognized because of their low luminosities .",
    "h97 estimate that more than 30% of stellar systems within 10  pc of the sun are currently missing from compendia of nearby stars .    the number of `` missing '' stars within 25  pc of the sun is estimated to be twice the fraction missing within 10  pc .",
    "the nasa / nsf nstars project is a new effort to foster research on all stars within 25  pc , with special emphasis on the development of a comprehensive nstars database .",
    "all systems with trigonometric parallaxes greater than or equal to 0@xmath004000 from _ the yale catalog of stellar parallaxes _ ( ypc , van altena _",
    "et al . _ 1995 ) and _ the hipparcos catalogue _",
    "( hip , esa 1997 ) have been included in the database .",
    "the weighted means of the ypc and hip parallaxes have been determined , including the combination of all trigonometric parallax values for stellar systems in which widely separated components have had separate parallax measurements .",
    "table  1 lists the numbers of known and predicted stellar systems within 25  pc , and their distributions within equal regions of the sky , obtained from the nstars database as of 01 july 2001 .",
    "the predicted number of 1375 systems in each region is based on the assumptions that ( 1 ) the density of stellar systems within 5  pc ( 0.084 systems  pc@xmath1 ) extends to 25  pc , and ( 2 ) the distribution of the systems is isotropic .",
    "table  1 clearly shows that more stars are missing in the southern sky than in the northern sky  we predict that more than two - thirds of the systems are undiscovered in the south .",
    "furthermore , new systems within 5  pc are still being found ( h97 ) , so the total number predicted within 25  pc is a lower limit .    in a concerted effort to discover and characterize the nearest stars , the recons ( research consortium on nearby stars ) team has been conducting astrometric , photometric , spectroscopic , and multiplicity surveys of known and candidate stars within 10  pc ( for more information about recons , see h97 ) . in this paper ,",
    "the sixth in _ the solar neighborhood _ series , we present optical spectra of 34 known or suspected nearby southern red and white dwarfs , including 10 known members of the recons sample and 16 stars for which no spectral types have been previously published .",
    "we report spectral types for all the stars in our sample using a method that will define the spectral types used in the nstars database .",
    "we supplement the spectral data with vri photometry for five stars .",
    "our analysis has revealed two new stars that are probably closer than the 10  pc recons horizon , and four others that are probably closer than the 25  pc nstars horizon .",
    "the 34 stars for which we obtained optical spectra are grouped into four categories :    1 .   _",
    "12 stars that lie within , or close to , the 10  pc recons horizon for which no broadband spectra are published .",
    "_ these stars have well known distances , so they are good standards for calibrating spectroscopic parallaxes .",
    "2 .   _ 14 recently discovered stars having high proper motions . _",
    "because nearer stars appear to move faster than more distant ones , high proper motion is a good indicator of stars in the solar neighborhood . between 1989 and 1997 ,",
    "wroblewski and collaborators identified 2055 new stars lying south of @xmath2 declination with proper motions , @xmath3 @xmath4 0@xmath015  yr@xmath5 ( wroblewski & torres 1997 , and references therein ) . in february 1998 , we observed 12 of the 52 stars from this collection that have @xmath6@xmath050  yr@xmath5 . we also observed two high - proper - motion stars selected from the calan - eso survey of ruiz and collaborators ( ruiz _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) . between our observing run and the end of 2000 , wroblewski and",
    "collaborators identified an additional 293 new stars with @xmath6@xmath015  yr@xmath5 , only one of which has @xmath6@xmath050  yr@xmath5 ( wroblewski & costa 1999 ) .",
    "_ 4 stars whose hipparcos parallaxes have suspiciously high errors . _",
    "nine targets in eight systems were reported by the hipparcos mission to have parallaxes larger than 0@xmath0100 with errors larger than 0@xmath0020 ( _ i.e. _ , 1456% errors ",
    "enormous for hipparcos ) . in every case , the targets are near bright stars that corrupted the parallax measurements . in two cases , hip  114110 and hip  114176",
    ", there is no star at all . in february 1998 , we observed two of the remaining seven targets , hip  15689 and hip  20698 , as well as two of the neighboring bright stars .",
    "4 .   _ 4 stars for which available photometry implies a distance less than 25  pc . _",
    "these stars come from an extensive list of possible nearby stars maintained by the first author .",
    "a total of 34 targets were observed during nights of ut 08 and 09 february 1998 using the blanco 4 m telescope at cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "the r - c spectrograph with a loral 3k  @xmath7  1k ccd was used with grating # 181 at tilt 58.77@xmath8 , order blocking filter og-515 , and a gain setting of 4 ( @xmath9  adu@xmath5 ) .",
    "the wavelength coverage was 550010000   , with a resolution of 6   .",
    "this broad spectral range includes the tio absorption bands characteristic of red dwarfs , the h@xmath10 emission line used to measure activity , and the k  i , na  i , and ca  ii absorption features used to discriminate dwarfs from giants .",
    "bias frames and dome flats were taken at the beginning of each night .",
    "a hear arc lamp spectrum was recorded after each target spectrum to permit accurate dispersion correction throughout the night .",
    "observations were conducted through clouds for four hours on 08 february 1998 , and for eight hours through increasing clouds on 09 february 1998 .",
    "several of the program stars were observed on both nights , thereby allowing confirmation of the spectral types .",
    "photometric observations were carried out in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 bands for five stars at the ctio 0.9 m telescope during our noao surveys program , ctiopi ( ctio parallax investigation ) , on the nights of ut 27 november to 01 december 1999 .",
    "standards from landolt ( 1992 ) and bessell ( 1990 ) were observed for the purpose of deriving extinction coefficients and transformation equations for each night .",
    "reduction of the photometric data was done using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) .",
    "bias subtraction and flatfielding of the vri frames were accomplished using the ccdred package , and instrumental magnitudes were obtained using the apphot package .",
    "the photcal package was then used to perform fits to the extinction and transformation equations , and to transform the magnitudes to the standard cousins system .",
    "an aperture of 3  was used to extract counts for the program stars , and aperture corrections used to match the methodology of landolt ( 1992 ) .",
    "errors in the final photometry are estimated to be 0.03 mag .      the long - slit spectra were reduced and extracted using iraf .",
    "bias levels were removed by subtracting a median bias frame scaled to match the overscan signal of each image .",
    "the images were flattened by dividing by a normalized , median dome flat from which the spectral response of the illuminating quartz lamp had been removed .",
    "after the removal of night - sky emission lines , the target spectra were distortion - corrected and wavelength - calibrated using the consecutively recorded hear arc spectra .",
    "one dimensional spectra were extracted from summed apertures of 10 to 14 pixels width centered on the spectra .",
    "correction for atmospheric extinction was performed using the default iraf extinction tables for ctio , but telluric features ( which can be seen in the white dwarf spectra of figure 2 ) were not removed . finally , the extracted spectra were flux calibrated using a recorded spectrum of the spectrophotometric standard star gj  440 and the appropriate iraf flux table .",
    "we have developed a software program , called allstar , that matches a target spectrum to one from a database of 106 standard spectra of k and m dwarfs previously published by recons ( see table  2 ) . when expanded to include the complete range of spectral types",
    ", allstar will likely become the standard algorithm for assigning spectral types in the nstars database .    for each target and standard spectrum , allstar interpolates flux values at 1    intervals between 6500 and 9000   , regardless of the original spectral resolution .",
    "the spectra are normalized at 7500   , a wavelength which lies in a region that is relatively free of opacity sources in red dwarfs ( and most stars ) . to account for possible spurious normalization of the target spectrum caused by noisy data ,",
    "an array of 21 spectra is created by multiplying the normalized spectrum by integral percentages between 90% and 110% .",
    "these 21 spectra are subtracted from each of the standard spectra over the entire 65009000    range , and the rms deviation of each difference spectrum is then computed .",
    "pixels offset by more than 2@xmath14 from the rms deviation are set to zero .",
    "trial and error has shown that this threshold effectively rejects unwanted pixels associated with variable telluric absorption features or detector defects .",
    "if more than 20% of the difference spectrum is rejected , then the standard spectrum from which it was derived is removed from further consideration . after rejecting the deviant pixels , allstar sums the elements of each difference spectrum and sorts the sums for all matches in ascending order .",
    "these ordered sums provide a rating system in which the standard spectrum generating the smallest sum is the best match to the target spectrum .",
    "the technique embodied in allstar differs from that used in previous recons efforts ( kirkpatrick , henry , & mccarthy 1991 ) in four ways : ( 1 ) allstar interpolates fluxes every 1    rather than every 3   , ( 2 ) the target spectra are compared with the standard spectra over the entire 65009000    range , rather than over pre - assigned chunks of the spectra , ( 3 ) rejection of varying telluric features and detector defects is carried out in a rigorous , well - defined fashion , and ( 4 ) spectral typing is based on a single , best match to a standard spectrum rather than a relative ranking of all spectra from bluest to reddest . for 100 of our 106 standard stars , allstar returns the same spectral types previously reported by recons and listed in table  2 . for the remaining six , allstar produces spectral types within 0.5 subtype ( the published uncertainty ) of those previously reported .",
    "these 0.5 subtype discrepancies are attributable to subtle differences in the reduction techniques , and are not significant .",
    "therefore , we have not altered the previously published types .    in table  2 , `` j '' has been appended to some of the previously published spectral types to denote those stars whose spectra represent the combined light of multiple components .",
    "the `` j '' ( for joint ) designation was not previously used for gj  22  ac , gj  352  ab , gj  570  bc , g  203 - 047  ab , gj  791.2  ab , gj  829  ab , gj  896  ac , and gj  896  bd because , for many of these systems , close companions have been discovered since their spectral types were first published . we anticipate that other changes in spectral type will occur once spectra obtained at infrared wavelengths are combined with existing optical spectra .",
    "table  3 contains astrometric , photometric , and spectroscopic information for the 34 stars in our sample .",
    "the photometry is given on the johnson ( @xmath15 ) and cousins ( @xmath16 ) systems .",
    "the photometry from weis ( 1996 ) has been converted to the cousins system using the relations of bessell & weis ( 1987 ) .",
    "previously reported spectral types for many of the stars come from reid _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) and hawley",
    "_ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , who used narrower - band spectra ( @xmath177400   ) than ours to determine the spectral types of over 2000 known and candidate nearby stars .",
    "our observations differ from theirs in that ours cover more than three times the spectral range and result in somewhat more robust spectral types .",
    "also listed are distances to stars with trigonometric parallaxes from hipparcos ( denoted by h ) or from a weighted mean of ypc and hipparcos measurements ( denoted yh ) .    using the @xmath18spectral type relation of henry _ et al . _ ( 1994 ) for red dwarfs ( st is spectral type ) ,    m@xmath19 = 0.101 ( st)@xmath20 @xmath21 0.596 ( st ) @xmath21 8.96 ( 1 )    we have estimated distances ( last column of table  3 ) to stars for which we have obtained new spectra and that have @xmath11 photometry .",
    "comparison of the true and predicted distances for the stars with known trigonometric parallaxes shows that the errors on the distance estimates are substantial , which is typical of distances estimated spectroscopically .",
    "however , only for gj  190 and gj  433 do the trigonometric and spectroscopic distances differ by more than a factor of two .",
    "gj  433 is a known close binary system ( bernstein 1997 ; confirmed by c.  leinert , personal communication ) , and we are suspicious that gj  190 may also be a close binary system .    we find that eleven of the candidate nearby stars identified by wroblewski and torres ( wt stars ) are red dwarfs of types m0.0v to m5.5v .",
    "the twelfth wt star is a newly identified nearby white dwarf .",
    "the two calan - eso stars are also red dwarfs .",
    "as expected , the hipparcos stars with large parallax errors are giants and , therefore , not members of the solar neighborhood .",
    "the four stars in the photometrically selected sample yield the highest proportion of nearby stars ",
    "gj  1123 and gj  1128 are likely to be within 10  pc , while gj  1129 lies just beyond 10  pc .",
    "( we lack the accurate @xmath11 photometry required to estimate the distance to lhs  1957 . )",
    "many of the targets with estimated distances within 25  pc are being observed in our southern parallax program , ctiopi .",
    "those stars likely to be within the 10  pc recons horizon receive the highest priority .",
