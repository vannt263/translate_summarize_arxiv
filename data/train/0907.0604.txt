    "describing structural and elastic properties at the nanometer scale has recently raised the interest of many scientists .",

    "different groups have tried to measure the elastic properties , most often the young modulus , by mechanical deformation while decreasing the system size@xcite .",
    "another approach to probe the elastic properties uses acoustic vibration of nanoparticles ( np ) and is mainly based on light or neutron scattering .",
    "acoustic vibration modes frequencies of np measured by raman scattering or pump - probe experiments are fairly well reproduced by linear elastic theory calculations even for nps with sizes of a few nanometers@xcite .",
    "the present work is concerned with the validity of elasticity within the vibration properties computed for systems whose sizes are smaller than the ones currently and experimentally explored . to achieve this goal",
    ", we compare the vibration modes calculated by linear elasticity and atomistic semi - empirical potential calculations in the case of metallic np of diameter ranging from 1.4 to about 4  nm .",
    "the choice of metallic np is motivated by the interest they arouse among the physicists community due to their plasmon properties opening many promising applications@xcite .",
    "vibration properties of metallic nps have been the subject of many theoretical studies using the linear elasticity or atomistic simulation , and experiments .    since the nineteenth century",
    ", the linear elasticity has been used to calculate the vibrational modes of spherical particles@xcite : such calculations generally agree well with experimental measurements of np vibrations@xcite .",
    "different refinements of this model have been performed taking into account the anisotropy of the stiffness tensor , the non - spherical shapes of the nanoparticles and matrix effects@xcite .",
    "the improvements of the experimental energy resolution and of the synthesis of such nps have allowed to demonstrate subtle effects due to the anisotropy of the stiffness tensor@xcite and due to the shape of the nps@xcite .    on the other side , using atomistic simulations , raman and kara@xcite studied the vibrational density of state of metallic nps .",
    "they showed that there is an enhancement in the vibrational density of states at low frequencies and an overall shift of the high frequency band beyond the top of the bulk phonons when decreasing the np size .",
    "the effect of the capillary pressure induced by the surface of the nps has also been exhibited on the vibrational density of state using atomistic numerical approaches@xcite . besides the study of the vibrational density of states ,",
    "severals studies have focused on few given vibration eigenmodes of nps .",
    "focusing on raman active vibration modes , the elasticity theory showed a very good agreement with atomistic calculations in spherical germanium nanoparticle@xcite .",
    "recently , a breakdown of frequency - spectra scaling of respectively , silicon and zinc oxide nanoparticles have been evidenced using atomistic simulations and attributed to surface effects@xcite .    in this study",
    ", we would like to address three issues concerning the vibration properties of metallic nps comparing the linear elasticity predictions and atomistic calculations .",
    "first , we compare the vibration modes of metallic nps calculated using either the elasticity theory or an atomistic approach based on an embedded atom model ( eam ) .",
    "a similar study has been performed by cheng et al.@xcite in the case of germanium nps .",
    "however , their elastic calculations did not take into account the anisotropy of the stiffness tensor . in this study , we show that taking into account this anisotropy in the elastic calculations improves the agreement between both approaches and that linear elasticity reproduces very well the vibration modes of nps having a diameter of a few nanometers .",
    "second , it is well known , that the vibration properties of a np containing @xmath0 atoms can be described by @xmath1 normal vibration modes . therefore reducing the size of the np",
    "also reduces the number of normal vibration modes .",
    "elasticity , as for it , can not take into account this reduction because of its description using a continuum medium .",
    "some studies include this reduction in elasticity theory by artificially limiting the number of modes@xcite . in this study , we illustrate the reduction of the number of normal modes by showing the disappearance of certain modes while decreasing the nps size .",
    "third and finally , while elasticity predicts that the frequency of a given normal mode scales as the inverse of a characteristic length of the np , surface effects can alter this law@xcite .",
    "we analyze this scaling in the case of silver and gold spherical nps and exhibit a characteristic size under which the frequency scaling break down .",
    "the breakdown of this scaling law is related to the surface stress and surface relaxation effects .",
    "section  [ sect_method ] describes the numerical method used for the elastic calculations , the atomistic model and the procedure used for comparing the two models .",
    "section  [ sect_result ] addresses the three problems mentioned above .",
    "most of the results presented here concern silver nps , except for the last issue for which the case of gold np has been considered .",
    "the displacement fields @xmath2 associated to each vibration mode are calculated in the scope of the linear elasticity theory by solving the navier equation@xcite :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the mass density , @xmath5 the frequency , @xmath6 the @xmath7 component of the displacement fields @xmath2 and @xmath8 the fourth order stiffness tensor . this equation can be solved analytically for a spherical system in the particular case of an isotropic stiffness tensor@xcite . in the case of an anisotropic stiffness tensor",
    ", we turn to a numerical solver . using the scheme of visscher et al.@xcite",
    ", we develop the displacement field components on a polynomial basis . solving eq .   then reduces to matrix algebra .",
    "we use in this study polynomials of order up to 20 to ensure the convergence of the method . note that this parameter depends on the vibration mode of interest : high frequencies vibration modes commonly correspond to high spatial frequencies which require an extensive polynomial basis .",
    "severals experimental techniques enable the observation of acoustic vibration modes , the main ones being inelastic neutron scattering(ins)@xcite , raman scattering , time - resolved pump - probe experiments and far - infrared absorption . whereas the absence of selection rules in ins makes it sensitive to all vibrations , the three other cited experimental techniques only probe a few acoustic vibration modes . therefore , among the very numerous calculated vibration modes ,",
    "we are mainly interested in those observable by raman scattering experiments . selection rules for raman scattering and far - infrared absorption for an isotropic solid sphere have been given by duval@xcite .",
    "only the breathing ( spheroidal , @xmath9 ) and quadrupolar ( spheroidal , @xmath10 ) modes are raman active . note that time - resolved pump - probe experiments only detect the breathing modes of spherical np@xcite .",
    "the irreducible representations corresponding to all the vibration modes have been determined after the displacement fields have been calculated@xcite . for a sphere made of a material having a cubic elasticity ( such as silver or gold ) , the non - degenerate breathing mode transforms into an a@xmath11 vibration ( o@xmath12 point group ) .",
    "the quadrupolar mode splits into e@xmath13 and t@xmath14 vibrations@xcite and the corresponding frequency splitting is large making the usage of elastic anisotropy a key factor for materials such as gold or silver .",
    "we perform atomistic simulations using the eam potentials developed by clery and roseto@xcite .",

    "[ elastic ] in order to focus on the comparison of the models and eliminate possible differences arising from slightly different elastic tensors .",
    "spherical nps are designed with atoms initially placed on a perfect cubic close - packed crystal structure using the bulk cell parameters of the modeled material .",
    "our nps do not specifically reproduced nps with magic number@xcite .",
    "in addition , our construction procedure inevitably produces some steps and facets especially for very small np .",
    "the total energy is then relaxed using a conjugate gradient algorithm : this procedure ensures that all vibration eigenfrequencies are real .",
    "our model omits the possible existence of surface reconstructions and dangling bonds : these aspects could correctly be addressed using more sophisticated techniques ( for instance dft or tight binding ) . the dynamical matrix",
    "is then computed and diagonalized to obtain eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors .",
    "eigenvectors are normalized for the usual scalar product in the real space of dimension @xmath1 with @xmath0 the number of atoms in the np . in the following , we study spherical nps from 19 to 2072 atoms corresponding to diameter ranging from 1.6 nm to 4.3 nm for silver nps and from 10 to 2491 atoms corresponding to diameter ranging from 1.4 nm to 4.5 nm for gold nps .",
    "the validity of the eam potential for a 10 atoms np is arguable and we admit that an _ ab - initio _ density functional calculation would be more appropriated in this case .",
    "however , in the following we compare the vibration properties of nps on a large range of sizes . as a result",
    ", it does not seem judicious to use different atomistic models for different sizes since it would also result in a slight modification of the elastic stiffness tensor .",
    "as a matter of fact , though quantitative results for the smallest nps would need a more accurate modeling , we believe that results described below are semi - quantitative in the sense that they give a good sketch of the vibration properties of nps while reducing size .    in the following",
    ", we will refer to atomistic modes for vibration modes calculated in the framework of the atomistic eam calculations .",
    "while the linear elasticity theory assumes a continuous medium and thus provide a displacement field for each vibration mode , atomistic vibration modes are described by the data of each atom moves@xcite . for this reason , and because the precise symmetry of the nps shapes is not fixed when relaxing the energy , the symmetry analysis we did in the case of the elastic calculation becomes more troublesome in the case of atomistic modes .",
    "instead , we prefer to project elastic modes on atomistic ones as it has already been done in the case of semi - conductor nps@xcite .",
    "the scalar product of the @xmath18th elastic mode with the @xmath19th atomistic mode reads : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the atomic positions in the atomistic model and @xmath22 is the displacement of atoms @xmath23 located at position @xmath21 .",
    "note that atomistic modes are normalized for this scalar product .",
    "we also normalize elastic modes so that :    @xmath24    a more relevant quantity is the sum of such squared projections of elastic modes onto atomistic ones for all degenerate elastic modes having the same irreducible representation and eigenfrequency@xcite .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath25 is a set of such elastic modes , we define its projection on atomistic ones as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of modes in the set @xmath25 .",
    "the denominator in eq . ensures the normalisation condition ( similar to eq . ) for the projection of a set of elastic modes .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 does not depend on the choice of degenerate elastic displacements .",
    "as such it is suitable for the comparison with atomistic calculations and will be used in the following .",
    "when surface effects are negligible , i.e. the nps size is larger than a characteristic size which will be established below , the elasticity theory reproduces very well the atomistic calculations .",

    "this degeneracy is partially lifted . as a result , 2 of these `` quadrupolar '' vibrations",
    "have the same frequency ( e@xmath13 vibrations ) and the 3 others have a different frequency ( t@xmath14 vibrations ) .",
    "it should be noted that the main effect of elastic anisotropy is to split the frequencies into 2 groups but that the corresponding displacements are almost unaffected@xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] provides a simple way to check that taking into account anisotropy in the elastic calculations significantly improves the description .",
    "the quadrupolar modes from the isotropic elastic calculation have a significant projection onto atomistic modes over a much larger range than the corresponding anisotropic `` quadrupolar '' elastic modes .",
    "therefore the anisotropic description is clearly an improvement .",
    "the e@xmath13 vibrations have a significant projection over a narrow frequency range . for the t@xmath14 vibrations , the projections are significant over a larger frequency range , but",
    "this is probably due to the light mixing which occur in the elastic calculations between the t@xmath14 branches coming from the isotropic quadrupolar and torsional ( @xmath33 ) modes@xcite .",
    "this mixing is different within the atomistic approach which explains the appearance of an additional peak at higher frequency ( @xmath34 ) .    in the following",

    "contrarily to the fundamental breathing mode , the projection of the first overtone spreads over several atomistic modes for nps made of 249 atoms and less .",
    "it is still possible to assign a main corresponding atomistic mode for a 249 atoms np but no atomistic modes seem to describe the elastic mode for the 87 atoms np .",
    "instead , this mode projects onto several atomistic modes with a weak scalar product . for smaller nps",
    ", it mainly projects onto the same atomistic mode as the fundamental breathing mode .",
    "this behavior is a manifestation of the disappearance of higher frequency elastic vibration modes due to the decrease of the number of atoms in the nps . indeed , while approximately 70 elastic modes have a frequency smaller than that of the fundamental breathing mode , this number increases to approximately 500 for its first overtone .",

    "+ figure  [ fig4 ] shows that atomistic calculations agree well with the efl for the atomistic quadrupolar modes and the atomistic fundamental breathing mode . except for the smaller np with 19 atoms , for which the frequency differs slightly from the efl , all the other points follow the efl .",

    "[ fig4 ] shows that the atomistic frequency starts to differ significantly from the efl for less than about 250 atoms corresponding to a characteristic diameter of 2.2  nm .",

    "we can reasonably expect that modes with a small wavelength ( such as harmonics of isotropic modes ) are more affected than longer wavelength ones ( or fundamental mode ) by the presence of the surface .",
    "obviously this claim also depends on the relative volume affected by the surface relaxation compared to the unaffected volume in the np : frequencies of optical modes or border zone phonon modes in a semi - infinite medium are not affected by the presence of the surface . finally , for the 19 atoms np",

    "while the atomistic quadrupolar modes reproduce the efl fairly well , the atomistic fundamental breathing mode significantly shifts from the efl at a characteristic size of about 87 atoms corresponding to a diameter of about 1.6  nm : the frequency of the atomistic fundamental breathing mode differs by about @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) from the efl for 19 atoms np and by about @xmath49 ( @xmath42 ) for the 87 atoms np .",
    "as in the case of silver np , we attribute the breakdown of the efl to surface relaxations effects .",
    "note that our results suggest that surface effects seems to be more important in gold nps than in silver nps ( for which the atomistic fundamental breathing mode reproduce the efl fairly well except for the smallest studied np ) .",

    "our results suggest that the breakdown of elasticity occurs for bigger nps for high harmonics rather than for fundamentals modes .",
    "moreover , critical sizes depend on the material . such breakdown to our knowledge ,",
    "has never been evidence experimentally in any material because of the difficulty to synthesize nps of diameter of less than 2  nm with a narrow size distribution or to perform single particle measurements on such objects .",
    "our results suggest that the observation of the breakdown of the vibration frequency scaling in silver nps will be hazardous , since it would imply some experiments on silver np ( or cluster ) of about 20 atoms for the fundamental breathing and quadrupolar modes .",
    "this task though difficult , seems more reachable in the case of gold np since it would require measurements on nps with less than about 100 atoms . finally ,",
