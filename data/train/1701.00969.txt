    "in low transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) region , even though the factorization might not hold , the colour - glass - condensate model  @xcite associated with nrqcd  @xcite did a good job in the description of the @xmath0 production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",

    "the perspectives of the long - standing @xmath0 polarization puzzle still have not converged .",
    "three groups  @xcite achieved the calculation of the @xmath0 polarization at hadron colliders at qcd nlo ; however , with different ldmes , their results are complete different from one another .",

    "the @xmath0 pair production at b factories is another challenge that nrqcd is facing .",
    "belle  @xcite and babar  @xcite collaborations observed the process @xmath10charmonium , and found no evidence for the @xmath0 pair events , while the qcd leading order ( lo ) calculation based on the colour - siglet ( cs ) mechanism predicted a significant production rate  @xcite .",

    "these distributions exhibited no significant excess in the range of about 300 mev above the @xmath0 mass , which suggested that the cross section for the @xmath0 pair plus light hadron ( e.g. @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) associated production is also too small to observe . to accord with nrqcd",

    "the double @xmath0 can also be produced through such kind of processes , e^+e^-c|c(n_1)+c|c(n_2)+g , [ eqn : process2 ] where @xmath28 denotes a gluon .",
