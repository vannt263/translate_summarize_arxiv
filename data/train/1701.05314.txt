    "in a wide range of mathematical modelling of natural phenomena , the quantities that are described through the mathematical system have to satisfy some positivity properties to ensure physical reality .",
    "for instance , when considering the evolution of matter quantities , such as in biology ( or also physics @xcite , chemistry @xcite , ... ) , the positivity of the solutions of the underlying dynamical system is a crucial prerequisite to achieve the well - posedness of the problem and to guarantee its physical relevance .",
    "a significant proportion of dynamical systems that describe the evolution over time of matter quantities are non - linear , but it oftenly appears that the non - linear effects can be seen as perturbations of linear dynamics , leading to such a differential formulation : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the modeled matter quantity at time @xmath2 , that mathematically lies in a banach lattice .",
    "when imposing a non - negative initial condition @xmath3 , the question of positivity is then crucial to study . in the case of a finite dimensional operator @xmath4 , this question has been extensively studied ( see @xcite and references therein for general results ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge , we do nt know any general criterion of positivity in the case where @xmath4 is a differential operator , _",
    "i.e. _ when the first equality in rewrites as partial differential equations ( pdes ) , while such differential operators are extensively used in mathematical biology , or also in many other applied mathematical sciences .",
    "for instance , in the specific case of biology , let us mention the use of structured population dynamics models , where the operator is of transport type , or the use of diffusive processes , where models incorporate a laplacian operator ( see @xcite for a review of positivity results in reaction - diffusion systems ) .",
    "the goal of this article is to provide an useful criterion of well - posedness and positivity for the semilinear problem for wide ranges of linear differential operators @xmath4 and non - linear functions @xmath5 , and then to illustrate the feasibility of this criterion through three examples of models arising from mathematical biology : epidemiology , predation and oncology .",
    "this article is structured as follows : section [ sec : biol ] is dedicated to the introduction of three concrete biological models , described by semilinear pdes , for which the positivity of solutions must necessarilly be satisfied .",
    "then we tackle in section [ sec : criterion ] the formulation and the proof of the criterion of positivity and well - posedness .",
    "this criterion is based on the formulation of an abstract semilinear cauchy problem , studied using a semigroup approach .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : appl ] , we apply the criterion to the biological models of section [ sec : biol ] to prove the well - posedness and the positivity of their solution .",
    "in this section , we introduce three examples of semilinear evolutionary problems in mathematical biology for which the positivity and well - posedness have to be proved for biological purpose .",
    "the matter quantities that are modelled in those three examples , _",
    "i.e. _ populations , predator / prey or cell densities , evolve with respect to the time @xmath6 .",
    "the epidemiological and predator - prey models deal with transport process , with a non - constant velocity in the epidemiological case and a non - local boundary condition in the predator - prey case , while the model in oncology deals with diffusive pdes .",
    "+ one can note that through those specific examples , a large spectrum of biological models are involved : pde structured population models ( see @xcite and references therein ) and reaction - diffusion models .",
    "[ [ epidemiology ] ] epidemiology + + + + + + + + + + + +    the first example on which we focus deals with epidemiology . when modeling the transmission of disease between individuals , a common way is to split the population densities into two sub - classes that are the susceptible class ( @xmath7 ) and the infected class ( @xmath8 ) . from such",
    "a splitting results the classical epidemiological model of si type @xcite .",
    "furthermore , lots of diseases ( influenza , hiv , prion pathologies ... ) have a varying intensity during their evolution that may be important to take into account in the modeling process .",
    "this phenomena was recently described in @xcite , where the disease intensity was incorporated into the infected class , leading to the formulation of the following infection load - structured epidemiological model of transport type : @xmath9 where the infection load is @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the integral operator defined for some integrable fonction @xmath12 on @xmath13 by @xmath14 and the epidemiological parameters satisfy the following assumptions :    * @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; * @xmath17 is a non - negative function such that @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 is such that @xmath21 for almost every @xmath22 .    for a biological relevance ,",
    "it is clear that for each positive initial condition @xmath23 , the densities @xmath24 and @xmath25 in problem ( [ systcompletepidemio ] ) have to remain positive whenever they exist .",
    "[ [ predator - prey - interactions ] ] predator - prey interactions + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    when considering predator - prey interactions , the age of the prey is a key factor of selection for the predator .",
    "it is therefore natural to add a structuration of the prey densities according to their age . in doing so ,",
    "the classical lotka - volterra model , that was initially an ode model @xcite , turns into the following pde model , that is developed in @xcite : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the density of preys and predators , respectively .",
    "the assumptions on the parameters are the following :    * @xmath290,1[$ ] , @xmath30 are constant parameters that respectively denote the assimilation coefficient of ingested preys and the basic mortality rate of the predators ; * @xmath31 are age - dependent functions that represent , respectively , the basic mortality rate of the preys , the predation rate and the birth rate .    to ensure a certain realism , we want that the densities of preys @xmath27 and predators @xmath28 remain positive given a positive initial data @xmath32 .",
    "[ [ oncology ] ] oncology + + + + + + + +    the third application is a model that describes the growth of a brain tumour published in @xcite .",
    "the model aims at studying a treatment method of tumor cells through a problem of controllability .",
    "the tumor and normal cells are in competition for the resources and are subject to a drug treatment whose role is to decrease the cell densities . even if some normal cells are destroyed , the key point here is that the drug affects more the tumor ones .",
    "+ to make explicit the model , let us consider @xmath33 a bounded domain of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , with boundary @xmath36 of class @xmath37 and for a fixed @xmath38 , let @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the evolution problem is then written using the following three semilinear heat equations , where the variables @xmath41 are delibarately avoided for a better reading : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 denotes the external normalized normal to the boundary @xmath36 . here",
    "@xmath45 stands for the density of tumor cells , @xmath46 the density of normal tissue and @xmath47 the drug concentration at any vector position @xmath27 and time @xmath2 . in the latter problem ,",
    "the growth rates of cells are defined by the functions @xmath48 according to the following logistic shape : @xmath49 the assumptions on the parameters are the following :    * @xmath50 are the coefficients for the space diffusive effect ; * @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , resp .",
