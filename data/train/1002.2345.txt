    "idea of possibility to exploit electron spin in transport phenomena was ignited by the discovery of giant magneto - resistance ( gmr ) effect  @xcite in fe / cr magnetic multi - layers in @xmath1 s and it holds future promises of integrating memory and logic into a single device . since the discovery of gmr based magnetic field sensors ,",

    "spintronics ' presents a new paradigm in quantum computation with incredible speed up in computational time and much reduced complexity in quantum - computing algorithm , using the idea of quantum coherence and spin entanglement .",
    "the key idea of spintronic applications involves three basic steps that are injection of spin through interfaces , transmission of spin through matter , and finally detection of spin .",
    "having considerably larger spin diffusion length molecules and quantum confined nanostructures e.g. , quantum dots are ideal candidates to study spin dependent transmission .",
    "therefore , from technological as well as theoretical point of view study of spin transport in mesoscopic regime is of great importance today .    till date",
    "several experimental and theoretical works have been done to investigate spin transport phenomena at nanoscale level . in @xmath2 rohkinson _ et al .",

    "it is observed that the conductance of such mesoscopic systems depends on the spin state of electrons passing through the system and can be controlled by applying external magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the aim of our present work is to study spin dependent transmission through a magnetic quantum wire . the quantum wire , composed of an array of magnetic atoms ,",

    "spin dependent conductance is obtained , and the current - voltage characteristics are computed from the landauer - bttiker formalism  @xcite . here , we explore various features of spin dependent transport using different orientations of local magnetic moments in a magnetic quantum wire .",
    "it is interesting to note that , _ for a specific configuration of local magnetic moments as we will describe latter , spin flip transmission dominates significantly over pure spin transmission after the system size becomes larger than a critical value .",

    "we start by describing our model as shown in fig  [ wire ] . in this figure",
    "we illustrate schematically the @xmath5d nanostructure through which we are interested to explore several features of spin dependent transport phenomena . in the present work",

    "we consider two different configurations of the mqw depending on the orientation of the localized moments on each site as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ config1 ] and [ config2 ] . in configuration @xmath5",

    "a similar definition goes for the green s function matrix @xmath56 as well .",
    "our first goal is to determine @xmath57 ( green s function for the wire only ) which defines all physical quantities of interest .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ equ5 ] ) and using the block matrix form of @xmath48 and @xmath47 the form of @xmath57 can be expressed as , @xmath58 where , @xmath59 and @xmath60 represent the contact self - energies introduced to incorporate the effects of semi - infinite electrodes coupled to the system , and , they are expressed by the relations  @xcite , @xmath61 thus , the form of self - energies are independent of the nano - structure itself through which transmission is studied and they completely describe the influence of electrodes attached to the system .",

    "we investigate various features of spin dependent transport through a magnetic quantum wire ( mqw ) for two different geometrical configurations depending on the orientations of the localized magnetic moments associated with each atomic site . in the first configuration ,",
    "all the moments are aligned parallel to each other and initially they are chosen to be directed along @xmath21 direction , while in the second one the magnetic moments are oriented in a wave like pattern .",
    "all the results shown in the present work are obtained numerically .",
    "therefore , we start analyzing the results by mentioning all the parameters those are used for numerical calculation .",
    "our first assumption is that the two non - magnetic side - attached electrodes are made up of identical materials .",
    "the on - site energies in the wire ( @xmath33 ) as well as in the leads ( @xmath37 ) are set as @xmath12 .",
    "hopping strength between the sites in the two electrodes is chosen as @xmath86 , whereas in the qw it is set as @xmath87 .",
    "the equilibrium fermi energy @xmath85 is fixed at @xmath12 .",
    "our unit system is simplified by choosing @xmath88 .",
    "energy scale is fixed in unit of @xmath89 .    throughout the analysis we address the basic features of spin dependent transport for two distinct regimes of electrode - to - mqw coupling .",
    "these regimes are described as follows .",
    "0.2 cm weak - coupling limit 0.1 cm this limit is set by the criterion @xmath90 . in this case",
    ", we choose the values as @xmath91 .",
    "0.1 cm strong - coupling limit 0.1 cm this limit is described by the condition @xmath92 . in this regime",
    "we choose the values of hopping strengths as @xmath93 .",
    "first , we plot the conductance - energy characteristics for a magnetic quantum wire in which the moments are aligned along a preferred @xmath94 direction according to the configuration @xmath5 ( for instance see fig .",
    "[ config1 ] ) . as illustrative examples , in fig .",
    "[ cond1 ] we show the variation of conductances due to pure transmission of up and down spin electrons ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) and spin flip transmission ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) with respect to the injecting electron energy @xmath42 for a magnetic quantum wire considering @xmath99 .",
    "it is observed that @xmath95 and @xmath100 exhibit sharp resonant peaks at some discrete energy values in the weak - coupling limit ( green and blue curves    of figs .",
    "[ cond1](a ) and ( b ) ) , whereas the peaks acquire some broadening in the limit of strong - coupling ( pink and red curves of figs .",
    "[ cond1](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the broadening of conductance peaks with the enhancement in coupling strength is quantified by the imaginary parts @xmath101 and @xmath102 of the self - energy matrices @xmath103 and @xmath104 which are incorporated in the conductance expression via the coupling matrices  @xcite .",
    "all these resonant peaks are associated with the energy eigenvalues of the magnetic quantum wire .",
    "therefore , it is manifested that the conductance - energy spectrum reveals the feature of energy spectrum of the wire completely .",
    "one interesting feature to be noted here is that , variation of @xmath95 and @xmath100 with energy ( @xmath42 ) are exactly mirror symmetric about @xmath105 as we set @xmath106 . for any other non - zero value of @xmath33 ,",
    "up and down spin channels get splitted but the conductance spectra does not remain mirror symmetric anymore",
    ".    on the other hand , in this particular configuration the conductance by spin flipping becomes exactly zero for the entire energy region as seen from figs .",
    "[ cond1](c ) and ( d ) , where the curves for the weak- and strong - coupling limits overlap to each other .",
    "the reason of zero spin flipping is explained as follows .",
    "occurrence of spin flipping is governed by the term @xmath107 in the hamiltonian ( see eq .",
    "( [ equ2 ] ) ) , where @xmath108 stands for the pauli spin matrix having components @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 for the injecting electron and @xmath112 being the localized magnetic moments associated with each magnetic site in the quantum wire ( qw ) .",
    "spin flipping is mathematically expressed by the operation of raising ( @xmath113 ) and lowering ( @xmath114 ) operators . for the local    magnetic moments oriented along @xmath115 @xmath94 axis i.e. , for @xmath116 , @xmath107 ( @xmath117 ) becomes equal to @xmath118 .",
    "accordingly , the hamiltonian does not contain @xmath109 and @xmath110 and so as @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which provides zero flipping for up or down orientation of magnetic moments .      to reveal the effect of orientation of local magnetic moments on spin dependent transport , in fig .",
    "[ theta ] we plot the variation of conductances ( @xmath95 , @xmath100 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) with angle @xmath121 made by the magnetic moments with the preferred @xmath21 direction .",
    "it is evident from this figure that the conductances ( @xmath95 , @xmath100 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) exhibit @xmath122 periodicity as a function of @xmath121 with reflection symmetry at @xmath123 .",
    "rotation of magnetic moments through an angle @xmath122 maps themselves into their initial positions .",
    "so @xmath122 periodicity in the variation of conductances with @xmath121 is expected .",
    "reflection symmetry about @xmath124 is equivalent to having a symmetry point at @xmath125 , which means rotation of magnetic moments from up to down direction is independent of the sense of rotation .",
    "all the essential features of spin transport described earlier will be more transparent from our current - voltage characteristics .",
    "current through the mqw is computed by integrating over the transmission curve following landauer - bttiker formalism .",
    "transmission probability varies in an    exactly identical way to that of the conductance spectrum apart from a scale factor @xmath126 ( which is equal to @xmath5 in our chosen unit system ) according to eq .",
    "( [ equ15 ] ) .",
    "the current @xmath127 shows staircase like pattern ( fig .",
    "[ current1](a ) ) due to the presence of sharp , discrete resonant peaks in conductance - energy spectrum in the limit of weak - coupling . with the increase in applied bias voltage @xmath128 , the difference in chemical potentials of the two electrodes ( @xmath129 ) increases , allowing more number of energy levels to fall in that range , and accordingly , more energy channels are accessible to the injected electrons to pass through the magnetic quantum wire from source to drain .",
    "incorporation of a single discrete energy level i.e. , a discrete quantized conduction channel , between the range ( @xmath129 ) provides a jump in the @xmath130-@xmath128 characteristics .",
    "contribution to the current @xmath131 due to spin flipping is zero ( fig .",
    "[ current1](c ) ) as the spin flip transmission probability is zero for this configuration @xmath5 .    in the limit of strong wire - electrode coupling , due to the broadening of conductance peaks current",
    "@xmath127 shows nearly linear variation ( fig .",
    "[ current1](b ) ) as a function of applied bias voltage    @xmath128 and acquires much higher amplitude compared to the weak - coupling limit .",
    "enhancement in coupling strength does not change spin flip transmission probability , and hence , @xmath132 shows zero value for the entire range of the bias voltage @xmath128 ( fig .",
    "[ current1](d ) ) .",
    "current due to down spin shows the same kind of variation with applied bias voltage .",
    "so this has not been shown in the above figure .      following the above description of spin dependent transport",
    "now we concentrate on a magnetic quantum wire in which the moments are aligned in a wave like pattern as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ config2 ] .      as representative examples , in fig .",
    "[ cond2 ] we plot the variation of conductances due to pure spin transmission ( @xmath95 and @xmath100 ) and spin flip transmission ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) for a mqw considering @xmath99",
    ". variation of @xmath95 and @xmath100 exhibits sharp peaks at some discrete energy values in the weak - coupling limit ( blue and pink curves of figs .",
    "[ cond2](a ) and ( b ) ) , while in the limit of strong - coupling they achieve substantial broadening with larger amplitude    ( deep blue and deep red curves of figs .",
    "[ cond2](a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "this broadening effect is clearly understood from our previous discussion .",
    "but for this type of configuration i.e. , where the orientation of each magnetic moment is increased gradually with respect to @xmath21 axis along the length of the quantum wire , conductance amplitude due to pure spin transmission ( @xmath95 and @xmath100 ) in the limit of strong - coupling is sufficiently higher than that of the weak - coupling case .    for this typical configuration , non - zero conductance due to spin flip transmission is obtained as given in figs .",
    "[ cond2](c ) and ( d ) . here , the magnitude of spin flip conductances are comparable in both the two coupling limits . as in the previous case ,",
    "conductance - energy spectrum due to up and down spins are mirror symmetric to each other across the energy @xmath105 , both for pure spin transmission as well as spin flip transmission , since we set @xmath106 in this case also .      in fig .",
    "[ current2 ] we show the variations of spin dependent currents @xmath127 and @xmath132 as a function of applied bias voltage @xmath128 for a magnetic quantum wire considering the system size @xmath99 in both the two coupling limits .",
    "all the basic features of currents are same as we observe in the case of configuration @xmath5 e.g. , step - like behavior in the weak - coupling limit and almost linear variation with larger amplitude in the limit of strong - coupling .",
    "but the notable signatures for this configuration are non - zero current due to spin flipping @xmath132 , and comparable amplitude of @xmath127 and @xmath132 in the weak - coupling limit for this system size . here",
    "also the down spin current shows the same nature of variation with the applied bias voltage and correspondingly we do not plot it .      at the end , in fig .",
    "[ system1 ] we present the variations of @xmath133 and @xmath97 with system size @xmath6 in the limit of strong - coupling .",
    "the conductances are calculated at the typical energy @xmath134 . for such configuration",
    "@xmath97 increases gradually with system size @xmath6 , while @xmath95 decreases with the rise of @xmath6 . for this configuration , the magnetic moments are oriented sequentially from @xmath12 to @xmath135 and from earlier discussion it is evident    that spin flip does occur when the magnetic moments are oriented at an angle @xmath121 with respect to the preferred @xmath21 direction .",
    "hence , for the configuration @xmath22 , @xmath97 increases with system size due to large number of sequential spin flip scattering and after a critical system size marked by the violet circle in fig .",
    "[ system1 ] , spin flip transmission dominates significantly over pure spin transmission .",
    "the critical size decreases with increase in injecting electron energy which is not shown in fig .",
    "[ system1 ] . in case of down spin propagation",
    "similar features of system size dependence is observed and we do not show this .",
    "in a nutshell , in the present work we study spin dependent transport through a magnetic quantum wire ( mqw ) using single particle green s function technique . we have adopted a discrete lattice model in tight - binding framework to illustrate the system which is simply an array of identical magnetic atomic sites . in our theoretical study two different geometrical configurations of the mqw depending on the orientation of the magnetic moments associated with each magnetic site . in the first configuration ,",
    "all the moments are aligned at an equal angle with respect to the @xmath21 axis , while in the second one the moments are sequentially oriented from angle @xmath12 to @xmath135 relative to the @xmath21 direction .",
    "orientation of the magnetic moments can be changed by applying an external magnetic field .",
    "we investigated conductance - energy ( @xmath136-@xmath42 ) and current - voltage ( @xmath130-@xmath128 ) characteristics for both the two configurations mentioned above .",
    "non - zero spin flip conductances ( @xmath97 and @xmath97 ) are obtained for configuration @xmath22 , whereas it is zero for up or down orientation of localized moments as illustrated in configuration @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to these we observed the dependence of conductances on polar angle @xmath121 for configuration @xmath5 , showing @xmath122 periodicity . in the last figure , we have plotted the variations of @xmath95 and @xmath97 with the system size @xmath6 for typical electron energy @xmath134 in the limit of strong wire - electrode coupling , which is the most interesting part of our theoretical study .",
    "it clearly demonstrates that after a certain system size spin flip transmission dominates significantly over the pure spin transmission . for a sufficiently large system",
    ", spin inversion takes place most prominently which can be utilized for fabricating spin based nano devices .    in the present work we have calculated all these results by ignoring the effects of temperature , spin - orbit interaction , electron - electron correlation , electron - phonon interaction , disorder , etc .",
    "here , we set the temperature at @xmath12k , but the basic features will not change significantly even in non - zero finite ( low ) temperature region as long as thermal energy ( @xmath137 ) is less than the average energy spacing of the energy levels of the magnetic quantum wire .",
    "in this model it is also assumed that the two side - attached non - magnetic electrodes have negligible resistance .",
