    "most pulsars spin about an axis that remains fixed in space , relative to our line of sight",
    ". however , in some cases the spin axis will precess .",
    "the free precession of an isolated pulsar due to a body asymmetry with respect to its spin axis is one such case ; the general relativistic `` geodetic '' precession of the spin axis of a pulsar in a binary system about its orbital angular momentum vector is another @xcite .",
    "spin precession , whatever its cause , allows our line of sight to progress across the pulsar emission beam .",
    "as this occurs , the observed pulse profile will also evolve .",
    "the detection of such changes in pulse shape is consequently a hallmark of spin axis precession . whilst we are forever bound",
    "to receive beamed emission from a single latitude on a non - precessing pulsar , the presence of precession , and the resulting pulse shape changes , enable us to make inferences about the two - dimensional structure of the pulsar emission beam , and the likely geometry of the system .",
    "secular pulse shape changes in psr b1913 + 16 ascribed to geodetic precession were first reported by @xcite . as more data accumulated in the mid-1990s , and the signature of precession became clearer , it became possible to use the observed change in the separation of the two principal pulse components @xcite to pick the geometrical models that best fit the observational data .",
    "the pioneering work of @xcite assumed a simple circular region emitting a conical beam of radiation from the pulsar . using this model kramer performed a least - squares fit on the observed pulse component separation data to find the best - fitting parameters that described the geometry of the system .",
    "later investigations were performed by weisberg & taylor ( 2002 , 2005 ; hereafter wt02 , wt05 ) . in these papers",
    ", the authors decomposed the pulse profile into symmetric and anti - symmetric parts and considered not only the time evolution of the peaks of the symmetric pulse profile , but also the separations of the contours of lower intensity .",
    "the profiles they obtained show that the equal intensity contours in the center of the profile appear to be moving together more quickly than those at the edge , which may even be slowly moving apart .",
    "the authors were unable to account for this strange behavior with a circular beam model ; instead they generalized the shape of the emission beam to that of an ` hourglass ' by adding two more parameters to the beam model .",
    "the parameters describing this deformed shape , and those describing the geometry of the system , were then fitted to the data to find a best model .",
    "our purpose here is to further investigate the observational consequences of a precessing _ circular _ beam model .",
    "it is possible to envisage a number of different ways in which our line of sight could precess through the pulsar s emission beam , each leading to qualitatively different observations of the evolution of the pulse profile here on earth .",
    "we investigate the different ` families ' of profiles that can be generated by different geometries of the pulsar . using this analysis",
    "we take a new look at families that provide good candidates for the geometry of the geodetically precessing binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 , and use them to revisit the question of whether this simple model is adequate to fit the observed data , as contested by wt02 and wt05",
    ". we also comment on the applicability of this analysis for other precessing pulsars .",
    "in order to investigate the types of pulse profile variation that can be observed from a precessing pulsar , we need to make assumptions about the shape of the beam being emitted and the nature of the precession process . we will allow the emitting region to be two  dimensional - that is , we will consider an emitting _ area _ being projected outwards from the pulsar , rather than simply an emitting line .",
    "this will allow us to generate families of pulse profiles of the flux density observed on earth as a function of pulse longitude and precession phase .",
    "for simplicity and clarity we will only consider emission beams that are circularly symmetric .",
    "more general beam shapes could be considered , but this would unnecessarily complicate the present study which is designed to focus on the effects of different precession geometries and beam orientations on the pulse profile .",
    "furthermore , for the purpose of specificity , we will build our model around the assumption that the precession is induced by the presence of a binary companion , which causes the spin axis to precess about the orbital angular momentum vector .",
    "however , we emphasize that the families of pulse shape would be the same for any type of spin precession process , and it would be straightforward to recast this model for the case of an isolated pulsar s precession .",
    "the coordinate system we use to model the geometry of the binary pulsar system is shown in fig . .",
    "we keep the same notation as wt02 where convenient , but choose our coordinates so that the spin vector @xmath0 and orbital angular momentum vector @xmath1 of the pulsar are _",
    "stationary_. while this coordinate system , which rotates at the precession rate , may seem less natural than one in which the bulk of the universe is stationary ( up to cosmological expansion ) , it will prove useful for visualizing the effect of the precession . a right - handed cartesian coordinate system ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) is included in the figure .",

    "furthermore , equation ( ) can be used to establish whether a family of contours will produce hourglass shapes for its smallest or largest radii - that is , whether its pulse profile looks like fig . or fig . .",
    "to see this we first note that @xmath124 must lie within the range @xmath125 to @xmath126 , in order that the emitting region should cover less than the entire surface of the pulsar .",
    "the quantity @xmath127 then increases in magnitude as @xmath124 becomes larger ( for fixed @xmath59 ) , as appropriate for psr b1913 + 16 . ] .",
    "we first consider the conditions necessary to produce hourglass - shaped _ inner _ 2dpp contours ; i.e , those that are hourglasses as @xmath128 , so that @xmath129 . taking this limit of eq .",
    "we find that if @xmath59 lies in the range condition2 ( i+ ) < - ( i- ) .",
    "the first of these small - radius oval - contour conditions allows for the possibility of larger radii simultaneously producing hourglass - shaped contours , and is a necessary condition to generate a profile of the form shown in fig . .",
    "the second of the above bounds signifies situations in which all of the contours produce ovals .",
    "having presented a way of visualizing the effects of precession , and having investigated some of the pulse profiles that can be achieved from a simple circularly symmetric emitting region , we will now confront our ideas with observational data .",
    "this will allow us to consider the degree to which deviations from this simplest model are required in order to explain the observations of psr b1913 + 16 . by finding the best fitting parameters for this model , we will also have found plausible starting points about which more complicated , future studies can focus .",
    "all data for this study were collected at @xmath130 cm at arecibo observatory .",
    "@xcite present descriptions of the pulsar observing systems employed .",
    "the details of the process leading to a final  session - average \" profile for each of twenty - three two - week observing sessions from 1981 to 2003 are given in wt02 .",
    "those authors and wt05 analyzed the same data set studied here .",
    "the data exhibit the following general features .",
    "the double - peaked pulse profile exhibits a @xmath131yr decline in the ratio of leading to trailing peak intensity , as first discovered by @xcite . until the mid-1990s , no other changes were detected , indicating that the @xmath132middle of a hollow conical beam was precessing across the observer s line of sight .",
    "the intensity ratio change was ascribed to locally `` patchy '' structure in the conical beam precessing across the line of sight .",
    "@xcite was the first to discover a narrowing of the separation between the two principal pulse component peaks , indicating that the center of the beam was finally precessing away from the line of sight .",
    "all subsequent observations indicate that the profile narrowing continued , but with some interesting twists .",
    "the 2dpps of wt02 and wt05 show that whilst the profile peaks moved together and the saddle region between them filled in , the outermost intensity contours did not converge over time and may have even diverged .",
    "it is our intention to use the new understanding delineated in  4 to search for possible circular beam solutions that could account for these observations .",
    "the preliminary stages of this investigation follow the procedures of wt02 and wt05 .",
    "each session - average profile was split into even and odd parts , and subsequent analyses focused only on the even parts , under the assumption that the odd parts represented local , `` patchy '' structure not relevant to overall beam modelling .",
    "the pulsewidth @xmath93 was then determined for each of fourteen intensity levels in all of the 23 session - average even profiles .",
    "we then diverge from the procedures of wt02 and wt05 by fitting these data to our circularly symmetric model , rather than to their elongated beam model .",
    "we fix the sine of the orbital inclination , @xmath133 , at 0.734 [ from the timing measurements of @xcite ] , and fit for four parameters : the colatitude of the magnetic axis @xmath59 , the spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath20 ( see fig . ) , the precession epoch @xmath134 and the overall scale factor @xmath135 .",
    "[ see wt02 for further discussion of these parameters . ]",
    "@xcite fitted for quantities similar to these parameters with his single contour model , and data on the separation between the profile peaks only .",
    "while the fitting process alone can not distinguish between four degenerate solutions , the earlier work of these authors shows that one of the four is favored for other reasons . in what follows",
    ", we will focus only on this one , which in all cases has @xmath136 .",
    "let us first consider focusing the fit on the part of the two - dimensional pulse profile immediately before the pulsar beam precesses entirely out of view ( i.e. , at late precession phases ) . in this case , it can be seen immediately that geometries in which the precessing line of sight vector , @xmath14 , enters and exits the emission beam on the _ outside _ ( as in fig .",
    "b ) are not good candidates to explain the observations .",
    "conversely , the late - precession - phase 2dpp generated from the line of sight entering and exiting the emission beam from the _ inside _ , shown in fig .",
    "b , match the observations much better . with these 2dpps",
    "we have the inner contours converging while the outer     and @xmath137 .",
    "each equal - intensity contour results from emission from a circularly symmetric conical beam .",
    "the intensity rises from one inner dashed contour to the next outer one ; and then declines as one moves outwards among the solid contours .",
    "the vertical axis is calibrated in years , but can also be considered to be precessional phase since @xmath101 is linear in time .",
    "see text for additional details.,height=566 ]    end - result     and @xmath138 .",
    "each equal - intensity contour results from emission from a circularly symmetric conical beam .",
    "[ end - result ] and text for additional details.,height=566 ]    waist - result    ones remain approximately stationary , in keeping with the observations of psr1913 + 16 .",
    "there is also the possibility of achieving a period shortly before this in which _ all _ the contours remain @xmath132stationary , as was observed by @xcite .",
    "such a period of stationarity is achieved by making the outer contours only mildly hourglass shaped , so that they appear as almost `` pill '' shaped .",
    "we display our attempts to find a fit in this `` late precession phase '' scenario in fig . .",
    "we find an approximate match when @xmath139 and @xmath137 .",
    "however , as indicated by the systematic deviations of data from the model illustrated in the figure , and quantified by a large @xmath140 , the fit is not particularly good .",
    "in fact , this particular configuration does not appear as a stable solution of the fitting program .      a second place at which to attempt a fit is near the ` waist ' of the model 2dpp hourglass ( i.e. , near the middle phases of the precession cycle ) .",
    "in this case it is the profiles generated just _ before _ the midpoint of an _",
    "outer _ line of sight precession cycle ( see fig .",
    "b ) that best match the observed `` inner - in '' and `` outer - out '' contours ; whilst the _ inner _ entry / exit 2dpp ( fig .",
    "b ) display the incorrect behavior near these precession phases .",
    "unfortunately , the recently observed convergence of inner contours requires such strong hourglass shapes that it is difficult to produce the required period of stationarity with this class of fit .",
    "we display our attempt to find a match in this `` pre - waist '' scenario in fig . .",
    "we find an approximate fit with @xmath141 and @xmath138 . again",
    ", however , the fit is poor .",
    "clearly these two results are not convincing enough to offer a complete explanation of the observed pulse profile from psr1913 + 16 by themselves ; deviations from this minimal model , such as those considered by wt02 , should be considered in order to find a better fit . however",
    ", the results of this study do show us where in parameter space we can start future searches with more complicated beam shapes . by searching in the vicinity of our approximate fits",
    ", we expect that the observed pulse profiles may be explained with only minimal deviations from this maximally symmetric model .",
    "a number of other pulsars exhibit long - term pulse profile changes that may be precession - induced , and which could thus benefit from the analysis techniques developed here .",
    "the candidates can be divided into two classes : first , binary pulsars like b1913 + 16 that are expected to undergo geodetic precession due to relativistic spin - orbit coupling ; and second , isolated pulsars undergoing free precession caused by a body asymmetry .    among the binary pulsars , b1913 + 16 currently has the most detailed and longest duration pulse shape measurements .",
    "precession - induced pulse shape changes have also been detected in b1534 + 12 @xcite , j1141 - 6545 @xcite , j1906 + 0746 @xcite , and j0737 - 3039b @xcite .",
    "however , with the exception of the last pulsar , the trends have principally been roughly linear in time .",
    "the final listed object is a member of a complicated double pulsar system , where magnetospheric interactions between the two stars are operating along with orbital and spin axis precession .",
    "hence our model will yield no unique insights into these systems , at least until data are accumulated across a significant portion of the precession cycles .    among the isolated pulsars showing pulse shape changes",
    ", most sources again seem to reveal long - term quasi - linear trends rather than periodic behavior .",
    "[ see @xcite for a review . ]",
    "the most promising object is b1828 - 11 @xcite , which shows periodic pulse shape changes on timescales of @xmath142 days .",
    "however , its signature exhibits a double - narrowing , a feature that is difficult to reproduce with a model of the type considered here .",
    "this suggests that b1828 - 11 manifests significant deviations from the highly symmetric configurations we have been considering .",
    "we have investigated the possible pulse profiles that can be generated from a precessing pulsar which emits a simple circularly symmetric beam .",
    "we have found that a coordinate system fixed to the spin and orbital angular momentum vectors provides a useful means of visualizing the precession process and its observable consequences .",
    "we showed that a variety of different two - dimensional pulse profiles ( 2dpp ) can be generated from one or more _ circular _ beams , including profiles where the contours of constant intensity can appear as either ovals or hourglass shapes .",
    "furthermore , we showed that it is possible to create 2dpp which are a combination of ovals and hourglasses , with the hourglass behaviour occurring at either large or small pulse widths depending on the geometry of the system .",
    "this work has direct application to the determination of the geometry of binary systems undergoing spin precession , such as psr 1913 + 16 .",
    "best fit models have previously been constructed for this system .",
    "@xcite found a best fit circular model for a single intensity contour .",
    "this model , whilst accurately modelling the peak of the profile , does not appear to produce a family of contours which fits the observational data of wt02 and wt05 , while simultaneously maintaining the assumption of a circularly symmetric emitting region .",
    "subsequent studies by wt02 and wt05 show that by giving up circular symmetry ( specifically by positing an hourglass - shaped beam ) , it is possible to reproduce a family of contours that fits the observations well .    the results found here show that simple circularly symmetric emitting regions can generate pulse profiles which have the same qualitative form as the observational data of wt02 and wt05 - oval shaped inner contours and outer contours which come together at a later time , and are possibly even hourglass shaped .",
    "a more detailed investigation , however , has shown that this simple model is not sufficient to fit the observations completely .",
    "never the less , the approximate fits we have found suggest that only minimal deviations from a perfectly circular beam may be sufficient to explain the data .",
    "the requirement of deviations from circular symmetry should not come as a complete surprise , as we know the full pulse profile contains an asymmetric component , that can not be easily accounted for with a circular beam .",
    "we expect the inclusion of the anti - symmetric component in future analyses should give important information about the detailed shape of the beam .",
    "we have shown that it is not necessary to deform the emission beam to be the same shape as the observed pulse profile , in order to produce ( at least qualitatively ) the required shapes .",
    "furthermore , this investigation has shown the most likely places to start looking for fits with more complicated beam shapes , if only minimal deviations from the circular model are desired .",
    "we expect that there will be a great many ways in which to deform the beam shape so as to produce better fits to the data .",
    "for example , one may consider circular contours of constant intensity that are not centered on exactly the same point ; or , one may wish to deform each of the circles by squashing and stretching them in various ways .",
    "we expect that it will be a matter of some difficulty to show which deviations are really the most probable , but expect that it will be useful to be guided by ockham s razor , and consider the most minimal deviations to be the most likely",
    ".    of course , future observations will be of great use in determining the true parameters of psr 1913 + 16 : different models predict that the pulsar will precess in and out of our line of sight in different periods of time .",
    "( compare for example , the future behavior of the pulsar as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ end - result ] _ versus _ fig .",
    "[ waist - result ] . ) as we continue to build up a more complete picture of the two - dimensional pulse profile , it will be a considerably easier task to find the true geometry of the system .",
    "we have also surveyed the observations of possibly precession - induced pulse shape changes in other pulsars .",
    "most of these observations are not yet sufficiently detailed to benefit from our analysis technique . as more data are gathered in the future",
