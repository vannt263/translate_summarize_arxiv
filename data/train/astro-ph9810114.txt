    "many seyfert  1 galaxies are known to be variable in the continuum and in the broad emission line fluxes on time scales of weeks to years .",
    "they might be variable on even shorter time scales .",
    "the continuum and line intensity variations can give us information on the radius of the broad line region ( blr ) and their internal kinematics .",
    "we will present some results on line and continuum variations in the seyfert galaxies ngc  7603 and mrk  110 .",
    "these results will be compared to earlier variability campaigns of ngc  5548 ( agn watch : peterson et al . , 1991 ;",
    "kollatschny & dietrich 1996 ) and ngc  4593 ( lag campaign : robinson 1994 ; kollatschny & dietrich 1997 ) .",
    "we are interested to study the variations of as many broad emission lines per galaxy as possible to look for individual differences in their amplitudes and lags with respect to continuum variations and to look for internal profile changes .",
    "we obtained optical spectra of ngc  7603 over a long period from 1979 until 1996 with typical sampling intervals of one year .",
    "ngc  7603 is a bright seyfert  1 galaxy ( @xmath0 ) with broad line profiles ( fwhm(h@xmath1)=6500  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "most of our spectra covering the whole optical spectral range ( see figure  1 ) were taken at calar alto observatory and at mcdonald observatory .",
    "spectra of mrk  110 ( @xmath3=-20.6 ) have been taken at the same observatories from 1987 until 1995 at 24 epochs .",
    "the emission line profiles of mrk  110 are quite narrow ( fwhm(h@xmath1)=1800  km  s@xmath2 ) similar to the so called narrow line seyfert galaxies .",
    "ngc  5548 has been monitored in the optical by many observers with different telescopes from december 1988 until october 1989 during the first year of the agn watch ( peterson et al .",
    "1991 , kollatschny & dietrich 1996 ) .",
    "high quality h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 , hei , and heii spectra have been obtained at 30 to 70 epochs .",
    "h@xmath4 and h@xmath5 spectra of ngc  4593 were taken at la palma with the wh and in telescopes from january until june 1990 at 23 epochs as part of the lag campaign .",
    "some of our optical spectra of ngc  7603 , normalized to the narrow forbidden lines , are shown in figure  1 .",
    "they represent five different epochs at low , intermediate and high stages .",
    "our observed h@xmath1 light curve is plotted for the period 1979 until 1996 in figure  2 .",
    "strong variations in the emission line intensities and profiles are clearly to be seen .",
    "the broad feii multiplets at @xmath744004700    and @xmath750805400    show variations of the same order .",
    "our light curve of ngc  7603 was not sampled with high frequency .",
    "therefore , the cross correlation analysis ( ccf ) of the emission line intensities with the continuum light curve gives only a coarse estimate of the radius of the blr of the order of 50 light days .",
    "normalized spectra of mrk  110 are plotted in figure  3 .",
    "the h@xmath1 light curve over the period from 1987 until 1995 is given in figure  4 .",
    "the highly excited heii  @xmath84686 line in mrk  110 shows the largest amplitude in the light curve , the broadest line profile and the strongest profile changes .",
    "indication of strong variability in the heii line has already been mentioned by peterson ( 1988 ) .",
    "our ccf analysis reveals that the broad heii line originates close to the central ionizing source ( in only 6 light - days distance ) in comparison to the balmer lines ( 4070 light - days ) .",
    "detailed analyses of line profile variations in ngc  5548 and ngc  4593 have been published earlier by us ( kollatschny & dietrich 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "individual h@xmath9 difference profiles with respect to our minimum state of ngc  4593 are plotted in figure  5 .",
    "there are variations on time scales of days only .",
    "the red and blue wings vary differently .",
    "individual segments in the profiles appear and disappear on short time scales .",
    "the observational results of the blr are very complex .",
    "but one can make some general statements .",
    "the higher ionized line have broader line profiles , show larger variability amplitudes and origin closer to the central ionizing source in comparison to the lower ionized lines .",
    "however , the feii lines in ngc  7603 show strong variations , too .",
    "there are line profile variations on time scales of days .",
    "the emission line cores and wings vary differently .",
    "line asymmetries are different from line to line and from outburst to outburst .",
    "there is a trend that the line profiles become more symmetric with increasing line flux .",
    "the cross correlation functions of the light curves of individual line segments with the continuum light curves showed that in some cases the outer line wings respond faster .",
    "but the response is different from line to line during the same outburst .",
    "strong radial motions can be excluded to be dominant in the blr .",
    "the blr seems to be clumpy and to consist of a limited number of clouds or cloud complexes only .",
    "these clouds or the ionizing source might have a bidimensional structure .",

    "but we can not exclude that the nlr might be variable on the order of a few percent over a time scale of 20 years ."
