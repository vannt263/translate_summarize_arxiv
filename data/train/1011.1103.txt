    "let @xmath0 be a nearest neighbour path on the one - dimensional integer lattice @xmath1 , and define for each @xmath2 and @xmath3 , its local time @xmath4 on unoriented edges : @xmath5 throughout this paper the unoriented edge connecting the sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 will be denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we fix a real parameter @xmath8 and define @xmath9 for all @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we then also define @xmath12 , which is therefore a particular linear combination of the number of visits by @xmath13 before time @xmath14 to the edges near @xmath15 .",
    "we consider a special type of self - interacting random walk @xmath0 with long memory started from @xmath16 , whose law is described by the following `` dynamics '' : for all @xmath11 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is another fixed parameter of the problem and @xmath19 . in plain words , if @xmath20 is positive ( respectively , negative ) , then the walker will prefer to jump to the right ( resp .",
    ", to the left ) at its @xmath21-st jump .",
    "we are interested in the long time asymptotic behaviour of the walk .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 plays a crucial role . depending on its value",
    "the qualitative behaviour varies spectacularly .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath22 is less dramatic .",
    "the driving mechanism is a generalization of the rules governing the so - called `` true '' self - avoiding random walk ( or true self - repelling walk  we will refer to is as the tsrw ) in 1d .",
    "choosing @xmath23 we obtain the tsrw with edge repulsion ( the latter looks at each step at the number of times it has previously jumped along its two neighbouring edges , and favors the less - visited one ) while choosing @xmath24 corresponds to the tsrw with site repulsion .",
    "in these two cases non - degenerate scaling limits for @xmath25 are proved @xcite , @xcite , respectively conjectured @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "see the survey @xcite for more information about these two cases .",
    "it turns out that depending on the value of the parameter @xmath8 , a rather rich phase diagram emerges .",
    "we refer to @xcite for background and motivation . for @xmath8 in @xmath26 ,",
    "we expect a similar scaling behaviour as for the tsrw .",
    "it is intuitively clear that for @xmath8 close to @xmath27 the mechanism can be viewed as a minor perturbation of the tsrw case .",
    "the fact that the interval of parameters where this kind of asymptotic behaviour is expected is exactly @xmath28 follows from more detailed arguments relying on the fact that this is the range of parameters where the coefficients of the linear combination defining @xmath29 in correspond to a positive definite sequence . for details of this argument",
    "see @xcite , @xcite . for @xmath30 , when the walk is repelled by its past visits to its neighbouring edges and even more strongly by its second - neighbouring edges , a kind of slowing down phenomenon seems to occur , where the walk gets slowed down by self - built trapping environments .",
    "a more detailed discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper will concern the range of values where @xmath8 is positive . in this case , the walk is repelled by its local time on the edges adjacent to its current position , but attracted by its previous visits to its two next - to - neighbouring edges . as we shall see , when @xmath31 , the self - attractiveness can win and the walk can remain stuck forever on a finite interval of consecutive sites , while this fails to hold for @xmath32 .",
    "it is therefore natural to define the ( possibly infinite ) interval @xmath33 of points that are visited infinitely often by the walk .",
    "we will use a simple explicit sequence of values @xmath34 that decays to @xmath35 defined as follows : @xmath36 and for all @xmath37 , @xmath38 our main result is the following :    [ thm : main ] suppose that @xmath39 . then :    * if @xmath40 , then the probability that @xmath41 is positive . *",
    "if @xmath42 , then almost surely , @xmath43 .    note our convention of denoting discrete interval length : when @xmath44 , this means that the number of _ interior _ lattice sites of @xmath33 is @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 will be the number of lattice edges in the interval ( i.e. , the length of the interval ) and @xmath47 will be the number of sites in the closed interval , including the endpoints .",

    "this trapping phenomenon when @xmath54 is reminiscent of the asymptotic behaviour of the _ vertex reinforced random walk _ in 1d , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . however , the differences are also conspicuous .",
    "the reinforcement scheme is of a different type , and here , there is no clear monotone attractiveness in the self - interaction mechanism , rather a competition between self - attraction and self - repulsion , where the self - attraction wins . due to",
    "this , the size of the trapping range increases to infinity as the parameter value approaches the borderline between the confined and non - confined regimes , at @xmath55 .",
    "we will in fact also give a more precise description of the asymptotic behavior of the walk , or rather of its local times on edges , in the case where it is trapped . in the scenario that we will describe and happens with positive probability , the renormalized local time profile @xmath56 will become deterministic in the large - scale limit : we will describe for each @xmath8 in @xmath57 an explicit sequence @xmath58 ( that will follow the values of a @xmath59 curve along an arithmetic sequence ) so that when @xmath60 for some @xmath49 , one then necessary has ( up to a set of zero probability ) @xmath61",

    "we will study some properties of @xmath66 and see whether it is possible to couple @xmath13 and @xmath66 is such a way that ( with positive probability ) they coincide forever .    by abuse of notation",

    "when @xmath74 , we can interpret @xmath75 as a local stream felt by the walker ( due to its past ) at time @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath75 is positive , it will tend to jump to the right , whereas when @xmath75 is negative , it will tend to jump to the left .",
    "we say that when it jumps ( from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ) to the _ opposite direction _ than the one suggested by the sign of @xmath75 and when @xmath78 $ ] , it does an upstream jump of intensity @xmath79 .",
    "we will be interested in the relation between the maximal stream that the walker has `` successfully overcome '' before time @xmath14 and the maximal value of @xmath80 .",
    "the main ingredient of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is the following _ deterministic _ statement , that says that there is no way of building up a stream larger than @xmath81 somewhere in the interior of the interval without having earlier performed an upstream jump of intensity larger @xmath82 somewhere . its proof is given in section [ s : proof_of_propo_mds ] .",
    "[ prop : mds ] suppose that @xmath62 .",

    "we see in particular that when @xmath14 is very large , all @xmath45 values @xmath101 are very small compared to @xmath14 .",
    "we can keep in mind that these are simple linear combinations of the @xmath46 non - negative numbers @xmath102 that also satisfy @xmath103    this leads us naturally to study the set of possible solutions @xmath104 to the linear system of @xmath46 equations given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 , with the convention @xmath107 .",

    "+ unfortunately , it seems quite difficult to get an explicit expression for such a stationary distribution",
    ". it would be actually sufficient to prove the tightness of some well - chosen functional in order to prove the existence of the stationary measure , but we have not been able to find a simple way to approach this .",
    "* one very natural question that the previous approach would enable to tackle ( but that could possibly be studied by other means too ) is to show that for the cases where we have proved that @xmath324 with positive probability , then the probability that @xmath325 for some @xmath326 is zero . * a related question deals of course with the behavior of the walk when @xmath8 is equal to one of the critical values .",
    "it seems intuitively clear that when @xmath327 , then the walk will almost surely not be stuck on @xmath47 sites .",
    "this is because of the fact that the corresponding @xmath183 and @xmath184 are equal to zero , so that for infinitely many times @xmath14 , if @xmath13 would stick to @xmath66 forever , it would be at the edge of the interval and have a probability bounded from below to jump out of it .",
    "but our proof ( that controls only the first - order behavior of the local - time profile ) is not able to control this , nor to prove that @xmath328 is equal to @xmath329 with positive probability . *",
    "even though it is a trivial observation , we would like to notice that for generic @xmath8 s , it is the case that there exist many @xmath330 such that one can find many non - negative @xmath331 with @xmath332 , @xmath192 and @xmath333 .",
    "this happens in fact as soon as the distance between @xmath334 and @xmath335 is smaller than all distances between the @xmath336 s and @xmath335 for all @xmath337 ( so that for non - rational @xmath338 , there are infinitely many such @xmath339 s ) .",
    "+ note that if one wishes to find a stationary measure for the couple @xmath340 as described above , then one would need to exclude these larger values of @xmath339 , which is an indication that it could in fact be a rather complicated issue .",
    "* the arguments that we have developed in the present paper seem to be adaptable in order to derive analogous results in some cases where the self - interaction depends on the local time at more than the four edges neighbouring @xmath341 and @xmath342 from the left .",
    "for instance , one could replace the definition of @xmath343 by @xmath344 the needed condition for the arguments to go through is dealing with the roots of the corresponding polynomial i.e. with the behavior of the corresponding generalized fibonacci sequence .",
