    "observations of the infrared background provide important information on the emission of cosmic luminous sources throughout the history of the universe .",
    "it has been suggested ( santos , bromm & kamionkowski 2003 ; salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) that a large fraction of the measured near - infrared ( 1 - 10 @xmath6 m ) cosmic background ( nirb ) arises from redshifted ly@xmath8 line photons and nebular emission produced by the first very massive metal - free stars .",
    "this hypothesis , however , is very demanding in terms of the required conversion efficiency of baryons into stars ( madau & silk 2005 ) .",
    "a large nirb contribution from such stars has more recently been rejected by the paucity ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 candidate sources in hubble space telescope ultra - deep observations ( salvaterra & ferrara 2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a more modest contribution from very high redshift galaxies , whose clustering should leave a distinct signature on small - scale angular fluctuations of the background light ( magliocchetti , salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ; kashlinsky et al .",
    "2004 ; cooray et al . 2004 ) , is still possible .",
    "kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have recently found significant nirb fluctuations in deep exposure data obtained with spitzer / irac ( fazio et al .",
    "2004a , 2004b ) in four channels ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath6 m ) , after galactic stars and galaxies bright enough to be individually resolved by the instrument have been carefully subtracted . with the only exception of the 8 @xmath6 m channel",
    ", the shape and amplitude of the power spectrum can not be reproduced by either contributions from intervening dusty , galactic neutral hydrogen gas ( cirrus ) or from local interplanetary dust ( zodiacal light ) .",
    "ordinary galaxies ( @xmath11 ) produce fluctuations due to their clustering and shot - noise",
    ". the faint flux limits ( @xmath12 @xmath6jy ) of spitzer data allow to push their residual clustering contribution below the level of the excess signal at relatively large ( @xmath13  arcsec ) angular scales ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "the shot noise component , estimated directly from galaxy counts , fits the observed fluctuations at smaller angular scales , and rapidly fades away at larger angles .",
    "the residual large scale signal has been ascribed by kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as coming from very distant ( @xmath7 ) sources provided their total flux contribution is @xmath14 nw m@xmath4 sr@xmath5 .",
    "the aim of this letter is to show that this is indeed the case .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section 2 we will briefly describe the adopted model , while in section 3 we provide predictions for the nirb intensity and fluctuations and compare the latter ones with the results of kashlinsky et al .",
    "section 4 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "schneider et al . ( 2005 ) have presented a scenario for the formation of galaxies in a concordance @xmath15cdm cosmological modelcdm cosmological model with parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , which lies within the experimental errorbars of wmap experiment ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) ] which includes a self - consistent treatment of two key feedback processes : ( i ) _ radiative feedback _ , suppressing star formation in h@xmath22-cooling halos and the formation of low - mass galaxies due to the effects of uv background radiation approaching the reionization epoch , and ( ii ) _ chemical feedback _ , which controls the transition from metal - free stars ( popiii ) to ordinary stars ( popii ) through the progressive enrichment of star forming gas with heavy elements released by supernova explosions ( schneider et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 , 2005 ; bromm et al .",
    "chemical feedback propagates through the hierarchy of galaxy mergers from progenitors to their descendants so that , at each redshift , existing halos which are allowed to form stars are classified as popii ( popiii ) galaxies depending on whether the halo itself or any of its progenitors have ( have not ) already experienced an episode of star formation .    within this model",
    "we can compute the comoving specific emissivity , @xmath23 , which is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the formation rate of halos of total ( dark+baryonic ) mass @xmath26 with corresponding stellar mass @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the minimum mass of halos ( corresponding to a virial temperature of @xmath29  k , i.e. @xmath30 ) allowed to form stars at redshift @xmath31 ; @xmath32 is the maximum mass of halos which depends on the details of their merging history ( see schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) ; @xmath33 is the template specific luminosity for a stellar population of age @xmath34 ( time elapsed between redshift @xmath35 and @xmath31 ) . following the results of schneider et al .",
    "2005 , both popii and popiii stars are assumed to form according to a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) with an efficiency @xmath36 .",
    "the emission properties of popii stars are taken from the galaxev library ( masses in the range 0.1 - 100 @xmath37 , metallicity @xmath38 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ) and those of popiii stars are based on the synthesis model for metal - free stars of schaerer ( 1 - 100 @xmath37 , @xmath39 ; schaerer 2002 ) .",
    "a set of independent observational constraints can be accommodated within this model ( schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) : the number counts of dropout galaxies at @xmath40 ( @xmath41-dropouts ; bouwens et al .",
    "2005b ) and at @xmath10 ( @xmath42-dropouts ; bouwens et al .",
    "2005a ) , and the value of the optical depth for thomson scattering @xmath43 measured by the wmap satellite ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ) . indeed , the predicted surface density of @xmath41-dropouts at a limiting magnitude of @xmath44 is @xmath45 arcmin@xmath4 ( observed value @xmath46 arcmin@xmath4 ; bouwens et al .",
    "the model is also consistent with the three candidate dropouts at @xmath10 reported by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2005a ) .",
    "moreover , the large value of @xmath47 can be matched with standard values of the ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies ( @xmath48 ) and gas clumping factor @xmath49 , resulting in a reionization redshift of 13.2 ( schneider et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the model presented in section 2 ( referred to as model c in schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) allows to compute the nirb intensity @xmath50 from @xmath7 galaxies seen at frequency @xmath51 by an observer at redshift @xmath52 .",
    "this can be done in a fashion similar to salvaterra & ferrara ( 2003 ) as :    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the proper line element , @xmath56 is the effective optical depth at @xmath57 of the intergalactic medium between redshift @xmath58 and @xmath31 ( see section 2.2 of salvaterra & ferrara 2003 for a full description of the igm modelling ) , and @xmath59 is provided by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "our results are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the background intensity , @xmath3 nw m@xmath4 sr@xmath5 , is almost constant in the 0.8 - 8 @xmath6 m range .",
    "popii galaxies dominate the nirb in the entire wavelength range , while popiii galaxies contribute at most 40% of the total intensity ( at @xmath60 m ) , via their strong ly@xmath8 line emission .",
    "we have checked that the sources responsible for such emission are too faint to be resolved and identified at the spitzer magnitude limit in all four channels .",
    "the total contribution of all galaxies at @xmath7 is 1.55 , 1.45 , 1.07 and 0.74 nw m@xmath4 sr@xmath5 in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 irac bands , respectively , representing a substantial fraction ( @xmath61 10 - 20% ) of the total nirb intensity estimated from integration of spitzer galaxy number counts ( fazio et al . 2004b ) .",
    "the angular correlation function of intensity fluctuations @xmath62 due to inhomogeneities in the space distribution of unresolved sources ( i.e. with fluxes fainter than some threshold @xmath63 ) is defined as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 identify two positions on the sky separated by an angle @xmath67 .",
    "the above expression can be written as the sum of two terms , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the first one due to poisson noise ( i.e. fluctuations given by randomly distributed objects ) , and the second one owing to source clustering .",
    "it can be shown that the shot noise contribution originating from @xmath70 galaxies is negligible , so we only concentrate on fluctuations which stem from the clustering of these sources , i.e. we assume @xmath71 .",
    "the method adopted here is similar to that presented in magliocchetti et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , whereby angular fluctuations are obtained by means of the expression :    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the comoving coordinate , @xmath74 ( for a flat universe and in the small angle approximation ) , and @xmath23 is defined as in section 2 .",
    "the spatial two - point correlation function of a class of galaxies @xmath75 , @xmath76 , in general results from a complicated interplay between the clustering properties of the underlying dark matter and physical processes associated to the formation of such galaxies ( see e.g. magliocchetti & porciani 2003 ) . however , the sources we are considering in this work are small enough ( typical dark matter masses around @xmath77 for @xmath78 , values which rapidly decrease when moving to higher redshifts , see schneider et al .",
    "2005 for further details ) and set at high enough redshifts to ensure that ",
    "if present  their sub - halo behavior falls into angular scales which are too small to be detected .",
    "we can therefore safely assume a one - to - one correspondence between halos and galaxies and write : @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the mass - mass correlation function ( evaluated by following the peackock & dodds 1996 approach up to 100 mpc comoving ) and @xmath81 the bias associated to all dark matter halos massive enough to host a galaxy at redshift @xmath31 . this latter quantity",
    "was then obtained respectively for popii and popiii galaxies by integrating the function @xmath82 - representing the bias of individual haloes of mass @xmath26 - opportunely weighted by the number density of such sources @xmath83 as : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the sheth & tormen ( 1999 ) mass function of the dark matter halos , @xmath86 is the fraction of halos that at any mass and redshift host a popii ( popiii ) galaxy and @xmath28 , @xmath32 are the limiting mass values for such halos to host either a popii or a popiii source ( see section 2 ) .",
    "the above prescriptions then allow to estimate @xmath87 , i.e. the contribution from the clustering of unresolved @xmath7 ( popii and popiii ) galaxies to the background fluctuations at different wavelengths .",
    "an important feature to mention about the resulting @xmath87 is that  independent of the considered frequency and only due to the high redshift of the sources in exam ",
    "it features a sharp drop at around 300 arcsecond beyond which it rapidly approaches zero .",
    "this implies that signals on scales larger than the above value such as those detected by some experiments ( e.g. hauser & dwek 2001 ; matsumoto et al . 2005 ) have to rely on the presence of a more local population of unresolved sources .",
    "finally , we can move to the calculation of the power spectrum @xmath88 originating from the above fluctuations , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the zero - th order bessel function .    in order to confront our predictions with the kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2005 ) results , @xmath88 has been evaluated in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8 @xmath6 m irac bands .",
    "our findings are summarized in figure 2 , where the dotted lines represent the fluctuations originating from popii galaxies , the dashed lines those due to popiii sources and the dot - dashed curves indicate the shot noise contribution from galaxies fainter than the limiting magnitude as estimated by kashlinsky et al .",
    "it is clear from the plot that at the lowest frequencies the contribution of @xmath91 galaxies can provide an excellent fit to the observed fluctuations ; in particular it dominates over the shot - noise component at all angular scales greater than @xmath92 arcsec . at 5.8 @xmath6 m ,",
    "their importance is reduced but the presence of @xmath7 sources is still required to properly account for the amplitude of the signal at the largest probed scales .",
    "finally , high redshift galaxies and shot - noise alone can not reproduce the power spectrum at 8 @xmath6 m , where the cirrus probably becomes the dominant component ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "2005 ) .    as a last point",
    "it is worth mentioning that , as expected within the present scenario , the contribution of popiii galaxies is negligible in all irac bands ; the amplitude of their signal is in fact @xmath93 times lower than that of popii galaxies in the most favorable case ( 3.6 @xmath6 m ) , while the popiii - to - popii contribution ratio can go as low as @xmath94 at the highest frequency probed by irac .",
    "using a physically - motivated , observationally - tested model of the early universe ( schneider et al . 2005 ) , we compute the expected background radiation in the nir by sources forming when the universe was @xmath95 gyr old .",
    "we find that the background intensity , @xmath3 nw m@xmath4 sr@xmath5 , is almost constant in the 0.8 - 8 @xmath6 m range .",
    "popii galaxies dominate the nirb in the entire wavelength range , while popiii galaxies contribute at most 40% of the total intensity ( at @xmath60 m ) , via their strong ly@xmath8 line emission .",
    "finally , we found that the infrared fluctuation excess on angular scales @xmath96 arcsec detected by spitzer / irac ( kashlinsky et al . 2005 ) is accounted very precisely by the clustering signal of galaxies at @xmath7 predominantly hosting stars with masses and properties similar to the present ones .",
    "two additional points are worth noticing : ( i ) very massive stars ( @xmath97 ) do not need to be invoked to explain nirb fluctuations and reionization history ; ( ii ) because of their small contribution ( @xmath98 nw@xmath99 m@xmath100 sr@xmath5 ) to the observed power spectrum in all channels , extracting the signal of the ( very ) first popiii stars is extremely challenging .",
    "future instruments ( as the james webb space telescope ) will be able to directly identify these sources up to @xmath101 or above .",
    "finally , the intensity of the nirb provided by @xmath7 galaxies falls short of accounting for the excess measured by irts ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2005 ) and dirbe ( hauser & dwek 2001 ) experiments .",
    "the origin of this component remains very puzzling ( salvaterra & ferrara 2005 ) and might require either a revision of current model of zodiacal light subtraction or the existence of a large population of faint galaxies located at @xmath102 ( or both ) .",
    "important insights on these issues are expected from the upcoming ciber experiment ( bock et al .",
    "2005 ) , that will be able to simultaneously measure the total nirb intensity and fluctuation power spectrum in the poorly known wavelength range 0.8 - 2 @xmath6 m . such instrument , in addition , will allow a clear separation of the cosmological signal from local foregrounds ( i.e. zodiacal light ) .",
