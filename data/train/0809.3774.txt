    "at low temperature , disordered systems exhibit a large number of metastable states which are responsible for their slow relaxation dynamics and their irreversible , hysteretic response to an external field .",
    "in many cases this response is very well reproducible and independent of the rate at which the field is changed , provided it is low enough .",
    "this shows that these systems always explore the same set of metastable states when driven by the external field and that thermally activated processes are irrelevant on experimental time scales .",
    "classical examples of such behavior are magnetic materials .",
    "when the external magnetic field is slowly cycled from large negative to large positive values and back , the induced magnetization displays a ( saturation ) hysteresis loop with a characteristic shape that depends on the mechanisms for the formation and evolution of the magnetic domains@xcite .",
    "other field histories give rise to a complicated subloop structure that is also well reproducible .    by definition ,",
    "the future evolution of a hysteretic system depends on its past history , and the theory of rate - independent hysteresis generally focuses on a dynamical description in order to describe history - dependent effects such as return - point memory@xcite .",
    "however , the hysteresis loop may also be viewed as a special path among the metastable states and one may wonder whether it is possible to characterize this path without having to follow the dynamical evolution . surprisingly , a general answer to this question is not yet available . in the case of attractive ( ferromagnetic ) interactions , however , an important fact is known : if the dynamics obeys the so - called no - passing rule@xcite ( i.e. preserves some natural partial ordering of the microscopic configurations ) , there are no metastable states outside the saturation hysteresis loop@xcite . since , as a general rule , the number of metastable states scales exponentially with the system size , this result implies that the corresponding entropy density ( or complexity ) is not positive outside the loop .",
    "what still remains to be understood is the situation _ inside _ the loop .",
    "a convenient framework for studying this problem is the zero - temperature random field ising model ( rfim ) driven by an external field .",
    "this is a model for disordered ferromagnets which is relevant to a large class of materials where disorder induces random fields@xcite . with the standard glauber dynamics",
    "( which does satisfy the no - passing rule at @xmath0@xcite ) , the metastable states are the so - called single - spin - flip stable states , each state being characterized by its energy and magnetization .",
    "the quantity to be studied in relation to hysteresis is @xmath5 , the number of metastable states at the field @xmath4 with given magnetization per spin @xmath3 .",
    "one can then reformulate the above question as follows : in which region of the field - magnetization plane is the logarithm of @xmath5 an extensive quantity ?",
    "in particular , does the saturation hysteresis loop identifies with the boundary of this region ? to answer these questions , one must study the properties of a _ typical _ system and compute the _ quenched _",
    "complexity @xmath6 of the metastable states@xcite .",
    "this is a nontrivial analytical or numerical task in general , and there exists very few results on the typical number of metastable states in finite - connectivity disordered spin systems . for the gaussian rfim",
    ", the only analytical result so far has been obtained in one dimension@xcite ( or , equivalently , on a bethe lattice of connectivity @xmath7 ) , showing that the curve @xmath8 coincides with the hysteresis loop .",
    "numerical results on the bethe lattice of coordination @xmath9 and on the cubic lattice@xcite strongly suggest that this property always holds when the hysteresis loop is smooth in the thermodynamic limit ( which occurs when the disorder is large enough ) .",
    "this means that the typical number of metastable states is exponentially large everywhere inside the loop .",
    "the situation is more complicated when the loop has a jump at some critical value of the field , which corresponds to an out - of - equilibrium phase transition associated with the appearance of a macroscopic `` avalanche''@xcite .",
    "this happens at low disorder in three and higher dimensions@xcite or on a bethe lattice for @xmath10@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite that this jump reveals the existence of a gap in the magnetization of the typical metastable states in a _",
    "finite _ range of @xmath4 , gap which may also explain the reentrant hysteresis loops observed when changing the driving mechanism@xcite .",
    "this assumption is also supported by numerical computations@xcite , but again there is no analytical proof .",
    "the aim of the present work is to give further evidence to this scenario ( both above and below the critical disorder ) by computing analytically the quenched complexity of the gaussian rfim on a bethe lattice to order @xmath11 , and comparing with the exact expression of the hysteresis loop@xcite at the same order .",
    "this will also help us to clarify the approach to the mean - field fully - connected limit@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model and present the general formalism for calculating the quenched complexity .",
    "section iii is devoted to the mean - field limit which is recovered when @xmath12 .",
    "the calculation of the complexity at the order @xmath11 is presented in section iv and the numerical results are discussed in section v. we finish with a brief discussion and some perspectives in section vi .",
    "more details on the analytical calculations are given in the appendices .",
    "we start with the rfim hamiltonian @xmath13 describing a collection of @xmath14 ising spins ( @xmath15 ) placed on the vertices of a graph of connectivity @xmath1 and submitted to an external uniform field @xmath4 .",
    "a ferromagnetic interaction @xmath16 couples the spin @xmath17 to its @xmath1 neighbours @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a collection of random fields drawn identically and independently from a gaussian probability distribution @xmath20 with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath21 . in the zero - temperature system with metastable dynamics@xcite ,",
    "the field @xmath4 is adiabatically varied ( for instance from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and back ) and each spin is aligned with its local effective field @xmath24 so that @xmath25 in the thermodynamic limit , the resulting hysteresis loop @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the magnetization per spin ) is smooth for @xmath28 and discontinuous for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a critical value of the disorder at which avalanches of all sizes occur ( an avalanche corresponds to a jump in the magnetization curve @xmath26 ) .",
    "a complete analytical description of this behavior is available in the mean - field model@xcite which can be obtained for instance by placing the spins on a fully - connected lattice . in this limit",
    ", there is no hysteresis above @xmath31 and the number of metastable states is not exponentially large@xcite ( but it may be larger than @xmath32 , even along the so - called `` unstable '' branch for @xmath33 ) .    our goal in this paper is to compute the first non - zero term in the @xmath11 expansion of the complexity @xmath6 . although the corrections to the mean - field result are certainly different on the bethe lattice and on the hypercubic lattice , we only consider the former case since an analytical expression of the hysteresis curve is available for any @xmath1@xcite .",

    "the surprising result that the magnetization of the most probable metastable states goes oppositely with the applied field is in full agreement with the numerical results of ref.@xcite ( see figs . 16 and 17 in this reference ) .",
    "let us stress again that all the above results concern the behavior of the _ quenched _ complexity , associated with the typical number of metastable states .",
    "the annealed complexity is much more easily computed ( along the lines of ref.@xcite ) but much less informative .",
    "it indeed remains positive outside the saturation hysteresis loop for finite @xmath1 , as shown in ref.@xcite , which signals the presence of `` atypical '' metastable states in this region .",
    "the two complexities only coincide along the mean - field magnetization curve in the limit @xmath82 and are then equal to zero .",
    "the main result of this paper concerns the organization of the metastable states of the rfim in the field - magnetization plane and its relation with the saturation hysteresis loop .",
    "calculations have been performed on a bethe lattice of connectivity @xmath1 in the large-@xmath1 limit to order @xmath11 .",
    "although some pieces of the solution are still missing , the following conclusions can be made , that complete and confirm earlier computations :    \\1 ) when the hysteresis loop is smooth in the thermodynamic limit ( strong - disorder regime ) , the quenched complexity @xmath319 is positive everywhere inside the loop , i.e. the number of the metastable states with a given magnetization increases exponentially with the system size , and it vanishes exactly along the loop .",
    "this is also the behavior computed analytically in one dimension@xcite and observed numerically for @xmath9 and on the cubic lattice@xcite .",
    "it is therefore quite reasonable to conclude that this is a general result .",
    "it would be nice , of course , to have another , more direct derivation of this property .",
    "\\2 ) when the hysteresis loop is discontinuous ( low - disorder regime ) , the quenched complexity is positive in two sectors :    first , in the two regions ( before and after the jump in magnetization ) that can be reached by a field history starting from one of the saturated states .",
    "it appears that there is an exponentially large number of metastable states when @xmath4-states ( i.e. field - reachable states@xcite ) are present , even if most of these metastables states are not @xmath4-states .",
    "the complexity vanishes along the two branches of the loop that coincide with the envelope of the @xmath4-states . in these two regions , the typical magnetization of the metastable states ( i.e. the magnetization of the states whose number dominates the whole distribution ) increases with @xmath4 .",
    "second , in a strip of finite width ( of order @xmath11 in our calculations ) around the mean - field magnetization curve .",
    "this region in the middle of the loop is inaccessible to any field history starting from the saturated states .",
    "in addition , the complexity does not go continuously to zero on the borders of the strip , which moreover do not identify with the `` unstable '' branches computed from the fixed - point equations of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is in this strip that the number of metastable states is the largest and the typical magnetization decreases with @xmath4 .",
    "the above results are in agreement with the numerical study of ref.@xcite for @xmath9 and for the cubic lattice and they suggest that in the low - disorder regime the region of positive ( quenched ) complexity evolves with connectivity as depicted in fig .",
    "we recall that a few metastable states are already present along the intermediate part of the mean - field curve@xcite .",
    "although the precise behavior of the complexity in the vicinity of the `` knees '' is still unknown ( and is certainly different on the bethe and on euclidian lattices ) , it is now clear that the discontinuity in the hysteresis loop associated with a macroscopic avalanche is due to the existence of a gap in the magnetization of the metastable states for a range of applied field .",
    "consequently , by controlling the magnetization instead of the magnetic field@xcite , one should observe a reentrant loop , as indeed observed in some magnetic materials@xcite and other disordered systems@xcite .",
    "finally , one may wonder whether the most numerous , hence probable , states in the middle of the loop are accessible dynamically ; it is , however , dubious that this can be achieved by performing a deep quench from @xmath320 to @xmath0 at a fixed field@xcite .    to conclude , we have related the out - of - equilibrium disorder - induced transition in the rfim at zero temperature to the distribution of the metastable states in the field - magnetization plane ( thus replacing the dynamic problem by a purely static calculation ) .",
