    "the data sets from lecs ( 0.64.5 kev ) , mecs ( 2.510 kev ) and pds ( 13150 kev ) detectors were fitted simultaneously . to allow for differences in the absolute flux calibration of the individual detectors ,",

    "a column density @xmath35 = 8.46 @xmath16 10@xmath36 @xmath4 due to absorption by the galaxy ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) , was included in all models used in the following .    in fig .",
    "2 , we show the residuals obtained between 0.6 and 150 kev for a fit with a power - law model plus galactic absorption . the fit ( where @xmath5 @xmath27 0.4 ) clearly illustrates the complex spectral structure below 10 kev ( see also appendix a ) and the strong and sharp `` rise and fall '' of the spectrum above 10 kev .",
    "because of the presence of the very strong fe k@xmath8 line , we first attempted to fit the overall broad - band spectrum with a pure reflection model model in xspec which is an exponentially cutoff power - law spectrum reflected from a plane of neutral , optically thick , material ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",

    "such a model is however ruled out ( @xmath38 ) since it falls short of the data between 8 - 20 kev for any value of photon index , cutoff , inclination and ionization state of the reflecting material .",
    "this clearly indicates that the sharp rise and fall observed above @xmath2 10 kev can not be explained _ only _ by the presence of an unabsorbed reflection component but requires , instead , the presence of a direct , strongly absorbed power - law component as modeled in sect . 3.1 .    in appendix",
    "a , we show that a model consisting of a soft power - law continuum , an iron line plus a strongly absorbed hard power - law continuum ( as initially proposed by i94 ) gives an acceptable description of the data below 10 kev . in the broad - band spectrum , however , we find that such model is ruled out ( @xmath39 @xmath27 1.4 , table 1 ) since it falls short of the data by a factor of about 2 in the pds energy range .",
    "the continuum below the line ( from about 3 to 8 kev ) is extremely flat , thus a simple transmission model from cold matter ( even with @xmath1 @xmath27 710 @xmath16 10@xmath17 @xmath4 ) can not _ simultaneously _ fit the low and high energy bands .",

    "the case @xmath48=1 corresponds to a 2@xmath49 coverage as viewed from the x - ray source .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained from this baseline model are given in line 2 of table 1 .",
    "the unfolded spectrum and data - model ratios are given in fig .",
    "3 .    the cutoff energy ( @xmath37 ) of the primary power - law continuum was then allowed to vary to search for a high - energy cutoff in the data .",
    "the fit gives a lower limit of @xmath37 @xmath9 200 kev at 90% confidence ( see fig .",
    "however , given the 10% systematic uncertainty between the mecs and pds normalizations ( cusumano et al .",
    "1998 ) , we estimated an additional @xmath2 50 kev systematic error on this limit .",
    "it is stressed that it is difficult to obtain a very stringent limit on @xmath37 in this source because its intrinsic spectrum only emerges at e@xmath920 kev , where with the present data it is difficult to statistically sort out the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath1 , @xmath5 , and @xmath37 .",
    "however , looking at fig .",
    "3 , we underline the clear absence of any cutoff at high energies up to about 150 kev . in conclusion , if a cutoff does exist , it occurs at energies above @xmath2 150 kev .",
    "the adopted baseline model ( admittedly rather complex ) is , however , too simple to describe correctly the overall complexity of the spectrum of mkn 3 . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss point by point the several `` deviations '' from the baseline model that are required by the data . for completeness , more complex models ,",
    "alternative to the proposed baseline model , are presented in appendix b. statistically , they represent viable alternative descriptions of the broad - band spectra . however , they were discarded on the basis of physical arguments and lack of simplicity ( occam s razor ) .",
    "first of all , in constructing the baseline model the absorption model used only considers photo - electric absorption and neglects compton scattering which , however , becomes relevant for @xmath1 @xmath9 10@xmath3 @xmath4 ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1994 , yaqoob 1997 ) . to take this effect into account",
    ", we used @xmath50 in xspec which describes the x - ray transmission through a uniform , spherical distribution of matter , correctly taking into account compton scattering ( yaqoob 1997 ) .",
    "as expected , this model gives a column density of @xmath2 1.1 @xmath16 10@xmath3 @xmath4 , slightly lower ( though still consistent within the errors ) than @xmath2 1.3 @xmath16 10@xmath3 @xmath4 obtained with our baseline model . at equal column density , the model that includes",
    "compton scattering is more effective ( by @xmath2 2030 % between 6 and 30 kev ) in reducing the transmitted spectrum .",
    "the fit with @xmath50 is statistically slightly worse than the one obtained with our baseline model ( @xmath51 @xmath27 6 ) .",
    "a slightly steeper ( @xmath5 @xmath27 1.83 ) high - energy power - law is obtained which , however , does not significantly change the other best - fit parameters ( including the line parameters ) .",
    "the main consequences of this correction are thus in the calculations of the source luminosity that strongly depends on the @xmath1 and @xmath5 values used . with the @xmath50 model , the 0.1150 kev luminosity",
    "is reduced to about 2.3 @xmath16 10@xmath52 ergs s@xmath19 , compared to the value of 2.6@xmath16 10@xmath52 ergs s@xmath19 obtained with the baseline model .",
    "secondly , there are still residuals at energies between @xmath2 2 and 4 kev ( fig .",
    "3 ) , namely a broad absorption structure at @xmath2 3 kev and some excess emission at @xmath2 4 kev .",
    "such excess counts indicate that the low - energy spectrum is probably more complex than a single power - law continuum , in agreement with _",
    "asca _ results ( iwasawa 1995 ( i95 hereinafter ) , g98 ) . as suggested by these authors , thermal emission and/or absorption plus emission from a hot photo - ionized medium could be relevant in mkn 3 .",
    "unfortunately , compared to the _ asca _ results , the poorer statistics of the lecs+mecs spectrum below @xmath2 4 kev does not allow a detailed modeling of these features .",
    "alternatively , we note that such features could be due to fluorescence of elements lighter than iron expected from the reflection component ( and not included in our model ) as calculated by reynolds et al .",
    "for example , the feature at @xmath2 4 kev could possibly be identified as a calcium k@xmath53 fluorescence line emission ( 3.69 kev ) . in any case , the baseline best - fit parameters only weakly depend on the exact modeling of the soft component because variations by @xmath2 50% in the soft power - law slope affect @xmath1 , @xmath54 and a@xmath55 by less than 10% , i.e. less than the statistical errors reported in table 1 .",
    "thirdly , the power - law continuum of our baseline model represents only a phenomenological model .",
    "we thus tested a more physical and self - consistent model : the comptonization model ( @xmath56 in xspec ) calculated by hua & titarchuck ( 1995 ) , that also includes reflection from optically thick gas .",
    "this model basically replaces the underlying power - law continuum with an exponential cutoff of our baseline model by a thermal comptonization spectrum with reflection ( magdziarz & zdziarski , 1995 ) . the fundamental parameters of the model are the thermal gas optical depth ( @xmath57 ) and its temperature ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we find that the data can be reasonably well modeled ( @xmath59 = 0.99 ) by an intrinsic spectrum due to thermal comptonization with @xmath60 and @xmath61 kev ( at the 90% confidence level for two interesting parameters ) .",
    "fourthly , the baseline model requires a broad iron line whose modeling is addressed in detail in the following section .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the shape of the continuum below the line ( in the energy interval @xmath2 310 kev ) is parameterized by a single power - law model ( with @xmath5 = -0.5 ) , the line residuals ( fig .",
    "5 ) suggest a complex profile .",
    "it comprises a red - shifted wing down to about 5 kev , a narrow and strong component peaking at @xmath2 6.4 kev plus a clear wing on the high - energy side of the line which drops at @xmath2 7 kev .",
    "a continuum @xmath5 = -0.5 model is clearly unphysical and should rise doubts on the interpretation of the line profile obtained in this way .",
    "however , such multi - peaked structure may suggest a physical origin in an accretion disk ( for the red and blue wings ) plus a superposition of a narrow line at @xmath2 6.4 kev produced far from the black hole .",
    "such conditions have been found in other seyfert 2 galaxies often grouped under the name of narrow emission line galaxies ( weaver et al .",
    "1997 , weaver & reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "however , contrary to what found by these authors in the sources they analyzed , in sect .",
    "3.1 and 3.2 we have shown that mkn 3 certainly has a large absorption column which strongly affects the modeling of the underlying continuum between 310 kev .",
    "indeed if we parameterize the continuum as given by our baseline model , we obtain the residuals shown in fig .",
    "clearly , the red wing can be almost entirely explained by the combination of the reflection continuum and strong absorption .",
    "this illustrates the complexities of spectral modeling of emission lines when the underlying continuum is not well defined .",
    "the intrinsic power of broad band spectroscopy in sorting out these complexities and the advantage of using @xmath0 in this case are clearly evidenced .",
    "however , fig .",
    "6 shows that `` even '' with our baseline model , the line appears complex with a significant excess emission at energies between 6.47 kev .",
    "fitting the data with two narrow ( @xmath21 = 0 ev ) gaussian lines yields a significantly better fit ( @xmath51 = 6 , for one more free parameter ) .",
    "the fit gives e@xmath62= 6.43@xmath63 kev , i@xmath62 = 3.5@xmath64 @xmath16 10@xmath46 photons @xmath4 s@xmath19 ( observed ) for the neutral fluorescence iron line and e@xmath65 = 7.00@xmath66 kev , i@xmath65 = 1.3@xmath67 @xmath16 10@xmath46 photons @xmath4 s@xmath19 ( observed ) for the line at higher energies , respectively .",
    "these values are similar to the results previously found with _ asca _",
    "( i94 , g98 , netzer et al .",
    "the observed intensity of the neutral line corresponds to an equivalent width of @xmath27 645 @xmath24 180 ev with respect to the reflection component and @xmath27 650 @xmath24 182 ev with respect to the absorbed power - law continuum .",
    "the observed intensity of the line at higher energies corresponds to an equivalent width of @xmath27 235 @xmath24 160 ev , @xmath27 164 @xmath24 113 ev and @xmath27 6.2 @xmath24 4.3 kev with respect to the reflection component , the absorbed power - law continuum and the ( soft ) scattered continuum , respectively .    from fig .",
    "6 , there is also an indication of a weak red - wing of the 6.4 kev iron line that could be attributed to compton down - scattering in optically thick , cold matter as found in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 by iwasawa et al .",
    "theoretical models predict that this compton shoulder should contribute with an intensity about one tenth that of the line core ( matt et al .",
    "unfortunately , we can not reach any firm conclusion about this because the feature is not statistically significant in the data .",
    "the _ observed _ 210 kev flux ( calculated with our baseline model ) is 6.5 @xmath16 10@xmath68 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath19 which",
    "places mkn 3 in an intermediate state between its brighter state observed by @xmath6 in 1989 ( f@xmath69 @xmath2 610 @xmath16 10@xmath68 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath19 , depending on the adopted model : awaki & koyama 1993 , i95 , g98 ) and the fainter state measured by @xmath7 in 1993 ( f@xmath69 @xmath2 1.31.9 @xmath16 10@xmath68 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath19 , depending on the adopted model : i94 , g98 , turner et al .",
    "1997a ) .    given the spectral complexity of mkn 3 , it is not straightforward to compare the present @xmath0 results with previous x - ray observations because any residual feature ( in particular the iron line intensity and continuum flux ) is a strong function of the model adopted for the underlying continuum ( see appendix a ) and also depends inevitably on the instrumental sensitivity and resolution . in order to provide a fair comparison ,",
    "we thus re - analyzed the archival _ asca _ gis and _ ginga _ ( upper - layer ) data and compared it directly to the @xmath0 mecs data . to reduce as much as possible the model - dependency in this comparison",
    ", we fitted each dataset only between 310 kev using a single power - law model with @xmath5 fixed to -0.25 ( the average value obtained from the 3 instruments ) and free normalization . a direct comparison between the three unfolded spectra is shown in fig .",
    "inspection of the figure reveals that i ) the continuum above the line ( e @xmath70 6.5 kev ) decreased by about a factor of 4 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 and increased by about a factor 2 between @xmath7 and @xmath0 , ii ) the @xmath2 56 kev continuum and fe k@xmath8 line intensity varied significantly less , by a factor of about 2 between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and by less than 50% between @xmath7 and @xmath0 and iii ) the 35 kev continuum did not vary at all .",
    "the slow responses of the fe k@xmath8 line and 36 kev continuum to the flux variations clearly indicate that such variations can not be due to pure transmission but need dilution by a constant component . the argument , in turn",
    ", is giving support to the results of our spectral analysis ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) which require inclusion of a compton reflection component . as a matter of fact ,",
    "all observations are consistent with a variable direct component and associated ( variable ) transmitted fe k@xmath8 line plus a constant reflection component and associated ( constant ) reprocessed fe k@xmath8 line .",
    "the non - varying ( reprocessed ) fe k@xmath8 line indicates that it did not respond to continuum variations occured 7 years apart and places a rough lower limit of @xmath2 2 pc from the central source on the location of the fe k@xmath8 line emitter .",
    "it should also be noted that the implication that the direct component of mkn 3 varies with time is also supported by the observed increase ( by a factor of @xmath2 3 ) between the @xmath11 and @xmath0 high energy fluxes ( see sect . 3.1 ) .    in the soft ( e@xmath71 3 kev ) x - ray band ,",
    "the @xmath0 flux of @xmath2 7.6 @xmath16 10@xmath72 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath19 between 0.63 kev ( corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath2 6 @xmath16 10@xmath73 ergs s@xmath19 ) is comparable to previous measurements with the @xmath74 ipc ( kruper et al .",
    "1990 ) , @xmath75 ( marshall et al .",
    "1992 ) , @xmath76 pspc ( turner et al . 1993 ) and @xmath7 ( i95 ) . therefore ,",
    "as previously pointed out by i95 , the lack of variability of the soft x - rays suggests that they originate from an extended region and immediately rules out a partial covering of the x - ray continuum which predicts that both hard and soft x - rays should vary simultaneously .",
    "mkn 3 does not show evidence for starburst contamination ( pogge & de robertis 1993 ) and turner et al .",
    "( 1997b ) estimated a thermal emission in the 0.54.5 kev band lower than @xmath2 6 @xmath16 10@xmath77 ergs s@xmath19 on the basis of its far infra - red luminosity .",
    "therefore the most probable explanation for the lack of variations is that the soft x - rays are dominated by scattering of the intrinsic continuum ( see also g98 and netzer et al .",
    "the above results have shown that the broad - band spectrum of mkn 3 is best described by the sum of a soft power - law , an _ unabsorbed _ reflection component , an iron line and a strongly absorbed hard power - law component .",
    "the most remarkable result of the present analysis is that the hard ( e@xmath9 20 kev ) x - ray spectrum is steep with @xmath5 @xmath2 1.8 and that there is no evidence of a spectral break in the data for energies up to at least @xmath2 150 kev .",
    "the steep intrinsic spectrum is consistent with the canonical value found for seyfert 1 galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 , perola et al .",
    "the lack of a cutoff in our data is consistent with the large average value ( @xmath37 @xmath27 0.7@xmath78 mev ) found for a sample of 5 radio - quiet seyfert 1 galaxies detected both by @xmath11 and @xmath6 ( gondek et al .",

    ", in preparation ) and possibly ngc 4941 ( salvati et al .",
    "1997 ) . as pointed out by salvati et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , a better knowledge of the number of such heavily absorbed sources is extremely important because it has direct consequences on synthesis models of the x - ray background ( comastri et al .",
    "1995 , gilli et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the 36 kev band",
    ", the spectrum of mkn 3 requires a relevant contribution from reprocessed emission , namely an unabsorbed reflection component with associated iron emission line .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained ( r @xmath2 0.95 , e(fe k@xmath8 ) @xmath2 6.4 kev , and ew(fe k@xmath8 ) @xmath2 650 ev with respect to the reflection component ) are comparable to the theoretical values expected for a cold reflector covering a solid angle of @xmath2 2 @xmath49 at the source ( george & fabian 1991 , matt et al .",
    "the long - term variability study suggests a distance of the reprocessor @xmath9 7 light years ( sect . 3.5 ) , that could thus be identified with an obscuring torus .",

    "the reflection component ( observed directly ) resulting from reprocessing of the ( same ) direct component by the inner surface of the torus .",

    "its energy ( e @xmath2 7.0 kev ) and intensity ( ew @xmath2 235 @xmath24 160 ev ) are roughly consistent with fluorescence iron k@xmath12 emission from either the reflection component or the absorption component .",

    "( 1996 ) , very strong resonantly scattered h- and he - like lines ( with ew between 24 kev with respect to the scattered component , depending on the material optical depth and the line being strongest in the optically thin regime ) are expected if warm material is responsible for the scattering .",
    "given the large uncertainties in our measurement of its equivalent width , especially when calculated with respect to the soft scattered component ( sect .",
    "3.4 ) , such possibility can not be excluded .",
    "there could also be a contribution from both k@xmath12 fluorescence and resonant scattering .",
    "moreover , we can not exclude that both the weak red and blue wings of the fe k@xmath8 line ( fig .",
    "6 ) are produced by an additional reflection component ( with associated diskline ) from an accretion disk , as commonly observed in seyfert 1 galaxies ( nandra & pounds 1994 , perola et al .",
    "1999 ) and , possibly , in some narrow emission line galaxies ( weaver & reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "reflection from a highly inclined relativistic accretion disk would indeed produce extra emission at energies below and above the transmitted 6.4 kev fe k@xmath8 line .",
    "in the case of mkn 3 , the effects of strong absorption and poor statistics hamper , however , a detailed modeling of such additional component that will require the use of more sensitive instruments like @xmath79 or @xmath80 .",
    "the main results derived from the present @xmath0 observation of mkn 3 are the following :        - having argued that a second absorbed power - law ( i.e. a dual - absorber ) is unlikely in this source , the data between @xmath2 2 - 10 kev require an unabsorbed reflection component to make the flat spectrum underlying the iron line .    - from the data fit and the long - term x - ray history of the source , the ( neutral ) iron line intensity is consistent with being produced in an obscuring torus placed at a distance of @xmath9 2 pc from the source partly by transmission through its rim and partly by reflection over its inner surface .    - iron line emission is also detected at @xmath2 7.0 kev .",
    "it can be interpreted either as k@xmath8 emission associated to the neutral reflection component and/or to the absorption , either as h- and he - like fe emission associated to the ionized soft scattered component , or a combination of the two .",
    "it could also be produced by an additional reflection component from a highly inclined relativistic accretion disk .",
    "overall , these results fit well into unified models scenarios of seyfert galaxies and highlight the potentialities of using @xmath0 in broad - band x - ray spectroscopy studies of buried sources like seyfert 2 galaxies .",

    "1 ) , we restrict here the analysis to the data below 10 kev . in agreement with previous findings ( g98 and ref . therein ) , the spectrum of mkn 3 below 10 kev is very complex , with prominent soft excess emission below 3 kev and strong iron line emission above a flat underlying 310 kev continuum .",
    "this is clearly illustrated by the residuals shown in fig .",
    "8 obtained by simultaneously fitting the lecs and mecs data with a single power - law model , with an extremely flat best - fit photon index @xmath5 @xmath81 .",
    "the three basic descriptions for the continuum shown here ( table a.1 ) comprise * a ) * a double power - law model ; * b ) * a soft power - law plus a hard , absorbed , power - law model ; and * c ) * model b ) plus an _ unabsorbed _ pure reflection continuum model .",
    "a gaussian emission line is added in all fits .",
    "the resulting best - fit parameters are given in table a.1 .",
    "we find that model c gives the best description of the data at energies lower than @xmath82 kev , with a @xmath83 compared with model b for one additional free parameter , in agreement with turner et al .",
    "( 1997b ) . however , it is difficult to clearly prefer one model to the other .",
    "inclusion in model b of extra emission / absorption features in the soft and/or hard component ( rather plausible if the scattering gas and/or absorbing material is ionized ) could account for most of the remaining residuals of the fit ( i.e , the 35 kev bump , iron edge structure and excess emission above @xmath2 7 kev , as shown in fig .",
    "this ambiguity is similar to the one resulted from the _ asca _ data that led to different parameterizations and interpretation of the same data by different authors ( i94 , turner et al .",
    "1997b , g98 ) .",
    "however , we have shown in sect .",
    "3.2 how such an ambiguity can be solved thanks primarily to the _ bepposax _ detection of the high - energy ( @xmath84 kev ) emission .",
    "this is also illustrated in fig .",
    "10 which shows that an extrapolation of model b ) to higher energies falls short of the pds data , thus requiring a more complex model with larger absorption .",
    "because of the spectral complexity , we also find that any residual feature is a strong function of the adopted model for the underlying continuum .",
    "for example , from the ratios shown in figs .",
    "9a , 9b and 9c there is some evidence of a broad absorption structure between @xmath2 78 kev that , at first glance , could be ascribed to absorption by ionized material ( g98 ) .",
    "however , a comparison of the different figures shows that the feature is significant within model a and model b but is only marginal in model c. indeed , in our baseline model , such an edge is entirely accounted for ( @xmath85 0.5 if an extra absorption edge is added at energies between 78 kev ) by the combination of the deep fe k edge of the large absorption column density plus the broad fe k edge produced by the reflection component .",
    "moreover , as shown in table a.1 , the same data give differences of about a factor of two in the line width ( and thus line intensity ) depending on the adopted continuum model .",
    "even for equal width ( compare lines in pannels b and c of fig .",
    "9 ) , a different continuum modeling can result in a @xmath2 20% difference in the _ observed _ line intensity .",
    "in conclusion , the above results highlight the need of broad - band spectroscopy for such complex sources in order to reach confidence that the continuum emission and spectral features are properly modeled .",
    "more complex models have also been fitted to the @xmath0 broad - band spectrum , in particular : a _ neutral _ dual absorber model and a dual absorber model with a mixture of neutral and ionized matter .",
    "the basic idea is to explain the flat @xmath2 310 kev underlying continuum without using an _ unabsorbed _ reflection component ( as proposed in our baseline model , sect .",
    "3.2 ) but with the addition of a second absorbed power - law component .",
    "the former model has been extensively used in the literature to explain complex absorption and/or flat 210 kev spectra of several seyfert galaxies ( exo 055620 - 3820.2 , turner et al .",

    "the latter model has been first proposed by g98 for mkn 3 based primarily on the _ ginga _ detection of an ionized fe k edge at @xmath86 8 kev . the results obtained with these models",
    "are given in table b.1 .",
    "the ionized absorber model used here is the _ absori _ model in xspec ( done et al .",
    "1992 ) with a temperature fixed to 10@xmath87 k , as in g98 ( none of the following conclusions changed , though , for a temperature ranging between 10@xmath88k ) .",
    "we find that both models give acceptable fits of the broad band spectrum and are both statistically indistinguishable given our data alone .",
    "none of them , however , gives a statistically better fit than the baseline model ( sect .",
    "3.2 , table 1 ) considering the increase by 1 and 2 in the number of free parameters for the former and latter model , respectively .",
    "given the poor statistics of the data at low energies , we did not attempt to fit a more physical ( and more complex ) model for the ionized absorber that would take into account emission / reflection from the absorbing gas or the possible presence of dust .    moreover , the main problem with both these models is that , in order to interpret physically different absorbing columns along our line of sight , one is forced to assume either that i ) the source of x - rays is not a point source as seen from the two absorbers _ and _ the two different columns cover different areas of the source or that ii ) the lowest of the two column densities covers the whole source while the larger one only partially covers it .",
    "the former geometry appears rather unlikely given the small dimensions generally inferred to the x - ray emitting regions in agns from variability arguments ( e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "the latter geometry could be more physical and fits well into the framework of unified models since one could identify the highest column density ( @xmath89 in table b.1 ) with the blr clouds , partially covering the source , and the lowest column ( @xmath90 ) with absorbing matter , eventually ionized , associated with the torus ( or its rim ) or with some matter in the outer zone of the galaxy ( e.g. hayashi et al .",
    "1996 , vignali et al .",
    "1998 ) . however , our best - fit results give @xmath89 @xmath2 1.2 @xmath16 10@xmath3 @xmath4 and a covering fraction of 90% ( table b.1 , column 7 ) which are at least an order of magnitude larger than commonly believed for the blr ( respectively 10@xmath91 @xmath4 and 530% , netzer & laor 1993 , kwan & krolik 1981 ) .",
    "such complex models may , possibly , also find alternative interpretations in terms of different geometries involving complex scattering by matter at non - uniform density and/or with non - uniform coverage .",
    "it should also be noted that the main reason g98 proposed an ionized absorption model was the presence of an ionized fe k absorption edge in the @xmath6 data at @xmath2 78 kev .",
    "however our mecs 710 kev data , with unprecedent statistics , show that such edge could be entirely accounted for by the combination of the reflection component and the larger column density ( required by the pds data ) as given in our baseline model ( sect .",
