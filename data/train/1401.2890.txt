    "the case @xmath9 of ( [ bt ] ) goes back to coifman and el kohen ( see @xcite for the detailed discussion ) , who noticed that a fourier transform in the @xmath10 direction makes @xmath11 for @xmath9 equivalent to @xmath0 bounds for carleson s operator .",
    "estimate ( [ bt ] ) highlights a bi - parameter structure of the directional hilbert transform .",
    "the bi - parameter structure arises since the kernel is a tensor product between a hilbert kernel in direction v and a dirac delta distribution in the perpendicular direction .",
    "if one considers the linearized maximal operator @xmath12 for some function @xmath13 , then inequality ( [ bt ] ) can be rephrased as a bound for the linearized maximal operator under the assumption that @xmath14 is constant on every vertical line @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "such vector fields @xmath3 of the form @xmath17 for some measurable function @xmath18 are call one - variable vector fields in @xcite",
    ". + the purpose of the present paper is to relax this rigid assumption on @xmath14 , and prove an analogue of ( [ bt ] ) for vector fields which are constant along suitable families of lipschitz curves .",
    "to formulate such a result , we perturb ( [ bt ] ) by a bi - lipschitz horizontal distortion , that is @xmath19 with @xmath20 for every @xmath21 and every @xmath10 , such that the transformation ( [ bilip ] ) maps vertical lines to near vertical lipschitz curves : latexmath:[\\[\\label{liplines }     two conditions can be rephrased as 1/a_0_1ga_0 |_2g|b_0    under these assumptions , @xmath5 norms are distorted boundedly under the transformation ( [ bilip ] ) .",

    "hence the change of measure is not the main point of the following theorem , but rather the effect of the transformation on the linearizing function @xmath14 , which is now constant along the family of lipschitz curves which are the images of the lines @xmath15 under the map ( [ bilip ] ) .",

    "[ nnremark1.4 ] the structure theorem for lipschitz functions by azzam and schul in @xcite states exactly that any lipschitz function @xmath37 ( any lipschitz unit vector field @xmath38 in our case ) can be precomposed with a bi - lipschitz function @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is lipschitz in the first coordinate and constant in the second coordinate , when restricted to a `` large '' portion of the domain .    without the assumption that @xmath33 , the operator @xmath41 might be unbounded in @xmath5 for any @xmath42 .",
    "the counter - example is based on the besicovitch - kakeya set construction , which will be discussed at the end of the proof of the corollary .    to our knowledge , this is the first result in the context of the directional hilbert transform with a lipschitz assumption in the hypothesis .",

    "this adapted littlewood - paley theory is the main novelty of the present paper .",
    "it is in the spririt of prior work on the cauchy integral on lipschitz curves , for example @xcite , but it differs from this classical theme in that it is more of bi - parameter type as it is governed by a whole fibration into lipschitz curves .",
    "we crucially use jones beta numbers as a tool to control the adapted littlewood - paley theory . to our knowledge",
    "this is also the first use of jones beta numbers in the context of the directional hilbert transform .",
    "+ in this paper we focus on the case @xmath0 , since our goal here is to highlight the use of the adapted littlewood - paley theory and jones beta numbers in the technically most simple case .",
    "we expect to address the more general case @xmath5 with a range of @xmath43 as in the bateman - thiele theorem in forthcoming work .    while coifman and el kohen use the difficult bounds on carleson s operator as a black box , bateman and thiele have to unravel this black box following the work of lacey and li @xcite-@xcite and use time - frequency analysis to prove bounds for a suitable generalization of carleson s operator . luckily , in the present work we do not have to delve into time - frequency analysis as we can largely recycle the work of bateman and thiele for this aspect of the argument .",

    "we do not know of a soft argument to achieve this relaxation , as the norm bounds arising from our argument grow unlimited as @xmath29 approaches @xmath46 .",
    "this question suggests itself for further study .",
    "+ part of our motivation is a long history of studies of the linearized maximal operator ( [ linmax ] ) under various assumptions on the linearizing function @xmath14 .",
    "if one truncates @xmath47 as @xmath48 then it is reasonable to ask for pure regularity assumptions on @xmath14 to obtain boundedness of @xmath49 .",
    "it is known that lipschitz regularity of @xmath14 is critical , since a counterexample in @xcite based on a construction of the besicovitch - kakeya set shows that no bounds are possible for @xmath50 regularity with @xmath51 .",
    "however , it remains open whether lipschitz regularity suffices for bounds for @xmath49 . on the regularity scale ,",
    "the only known result is for real analytic vector fields @xmath3 by stein and street in @xcite .",
    "a prior partial result in this direction appears in @xcite .",
    "it is our hope that our result corners some of the difficulties of approaching lipschitz regularity in the classical problem .",
    "further substantial progress ( including the case @xmath45 ) is likely to use lipschitz regularity not only of the level curves of @xmath14 but also of @xmath14 itself across the level curves .",
    "for example , one possibility would be to cut the plane into different pieces by the theorem of azzam and schul stated in remark [ nnremark1.4 ] , and to analyze each piece separately by the main theorem in the present paper .",
    "we leave this for the future study .",
    "+ related to the directional hilbert transform and thus additional motivation for the present work is the directional maximal operator @xmath52 which arises for example in lebesgue type differentiation questions and has an even longer history of interest than the directional hilbert transform .",
    "hilbert transforms and maximal operators share many features , in particular they have the same scaling and thus share the same potential @xmath5 bounds .",
    "the maximal operator is in some ways easier as it is positive and does not have a singular kernel .",
    "for example , bounds for the maximal operator under the assumption of real analytic vector fields were proved much earlier by bourgain in @xcite .",
    "an instance of bounds satisfied by the maximal operator but not the hilbert transform arises when one restricts the range of the function @xmath14 instead of the regularity . for certain sets of directions characterized by bateman in @xcite",
    "there are bounds for the maximal operator ( for example for the set of lacunary directions ) , while karagulyan proves in @xcite that no such bounds are possible for the hilbert transform .",
    "on the other hand , the hilbert transform is easier in some other aspects , most notably it is a linear operator .",
    "for example , bounds for the bilinear hilbert transform mapping into @xmath53 were known ( lacey and thiele @xcite , @xcite ) before the corresponding maximal operator bounds ( lacey @xcite ) , due to the fact that orthogonality between different tiles is preserved under the hilbert transform but not the maximal operator",
    ". in particular we do not know at the moment whether the analogue of our main theorem holds for the directional maximal operator .",
    "this may be an interesting subject for further investigation .",
    "+ * outline of paper : * in section 2 we will prove corollary [ corollary1.2 ] by reducing it to the main theorem .",
    "the reduction will also be used later in the proof of the main theorem .    in section 3",
    "we will state the strategy of the proof for the main theorem . as it appears that our result is a lipschitz perturbation of the one by bateman and thiele , this turns out also to be the case for the proof :",
    "if we denote by @xmath54 a littlewood - paley operator in the @xmath10-variable , the main observation in bateman and thiele s proof is that @xmath4 commutes with @xmath54 . in our case , this is no longer true .",
    "however , we can make use of an adapted version of the littlewood - paley projection operator @xmath55 ( see definition [ definition1 ] ) to partially recover the orthogonality .",
    "we split the operator @xmath4 into a main term and a commutator term _",
    "k h_v p_k(f)=_k(h_v p_k(f)-_k h_v p_k(f)+_k h_v p_k(f ) ) .",
    "the boundedness of the main term @xmath56 is essentially due to lacey and li @xcite , with conditionality on certain maximal operator estimate . in section 4",
    "we modify bateman s argument in @xcite and @xcite to the case of vector fields constant on lipschitz curves and remove the conditionality on that maximal operator .",
