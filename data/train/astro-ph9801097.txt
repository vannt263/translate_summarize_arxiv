    "the * e*uropean * p*ulsar * n*etwork ( `` * epn * '' ) is an association of european astrophysical research institutes that co  operate in the subject of pulsar research .",
    "all institutes have up until now developed their own individual hardware and software facilities tailored to their own requirements and will , of course , continue to do so in future .",
    "contact and co  operation has always existed between the scientists of the member institutes and outside , but the lack of a common standard format for pulsar data has hampered previous collaborative research efforts .    in this paper , we describe a flexible format that we have developed for exchanging data between epn pulsar groups .",
    "the format has some generic similarities to the widely used fits format ( wells et al .",
    "1981 ) but has been designed to meet the specific needs of the epn .",
    "the format has proved so successful that we now advocate its use as a useful world  wide utility for pulsar data exchange . to aid implementation of the format , we have written a suite of freely available _ fortran77 _ sub",
    " routines which can be easily incorporated within existing software to read and write data in this format .",
    "astrophysical applications of such a format currently being pursued by epn groups include the establishment of a data bank of pulse profiles as well as simultaneous observations of pulsars by several european observatories .",
    "the underlying principles of the format result from a number of requirements .",
    "this was essentially a balance between the need for efficient data storage and providing sufficient information about the data for potential users .",
    "specifically , the following requirements had to be met :    * * operating system independence : * to make the data format as portable as possible between present and future operating systems , we have opted to use only ascii  data throughout .",
    "we have arrange these data so that words are aligned over 80-byte boundaries , this simplifies inspection and printing of the files . * * completeness : * the data should contain all information for the identification of the source and the observing circumstances useful for further analyses of the data by others . * * compactness : * descriptive information should not dominate the format .",
    "the measured values that form the bulk of a block of data are given as scaled four - character hexadecimal numbers , giving a dynamic range of up to 65536:1 .",
    "* * versatility : * the format should be suitable for continuously sampled multi - channel filterbank search data , synchronous integrated and single ",
    "pulse data as well as processed data . in addition , we have designed the format , so that it can be used for observations of pulsars outside the radio regime _ i.e. _ variable units for the observing frequency and bandwidth , as well as topocentric telescope coordinates which are time variable for satellite observatories .",
    "space is left for more descriptors , future adaptations and expansions . * * simplicity and ease of access : * we describe a data format consisting of a standardised fixed - length header with a variable length data structure attached to it .",
    "the header fully describes the structure of the data , which is not changed within one file but can vary between files . in this way , it is possible to calculate the length of a data block within each file after reading its header .",
    "the file can then be opened for random access with fixed block length , faster than a sequential read .    many of the above mentioned requirements were already met by a format in use at jodrell bank to which we made suitable modifications and extensions to make it more flexible .",
    "each epn file consists of one or more epn blocks .",
    "the basic structure of an epn block is shown in fig .",
    "1 . each file has a common fixed length _ header _ followed by a number of individual _ data streams _ of equal length .",
    "the header describes the data , containing information on the pulsar itself , the observing system used to make the observation as well as some free - form information about the processing history of the data .",
    "the onus is on the site ",
    "specific conversion process to ensure correct conversion to the standardised entries and reference to common catalogues ( e.g.  the taylor et al .  1993 catalogue of pulsar parameters ) .",
    "the full list of header variables is given in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the data streams themselves may be outputs of different polarisation channels , or individual channels ( bands ) of a filterbank or a combination thereof . in total , there may be @xmath0 data streams of i.e. different frequencies for each polarisation .",
    "each data stream starts with a small , fixed length sub - header in front of the actual data values .",
    "the number of data streams and their length may vary between different epn files , but is constant within each file .",
    "a character field and an ordinal number is provided for each stream for its identification .",

    "pulsars are , in general , very weak sources , typically requiring the addition of several thousand individual pulses with a large radio telescope equipped with sensitive receivers in order to attain a sufficiently large signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the brightest pulsars are , however , strong enough so that individual pulses can be observed .",
    "these pulses are known to exhibit great variety in morphology and polarimetric properties from one pulse to the next ( see for example lyne & smith 1990 ) .",
    "it is presently unclear whether the same features in the individual pulses are present at different observing frequencies .",
    "one of the current research topics being carried out by epn is a multi - frequency study of single pulses .",
    "the project requires the pulses observed at different telescopes to be time - aligned and thus the format described above has an ideal application in this project .",
    "after conversion of the data into this format , the time alignment of the pulses and subsequent statistical analyses is a relatively straight - forward procedure . as an example , a set of pulses from psr b0329 + 54 observed simultaneously at bologna ( 410 mhz ) , jodrell bank ( 1.404 ghz ) and effelsberg ( 4.850 ghz ) are shown in fig .",
    "2 . the pulses show a remarkable similarity at these three frequencies , although counter examples are also observed .",
    "full results of this study will be published shortly .",
    "( 0,2.7 ) ( -.2,6.5 )    ( -.2,5.0 )",
    "as well as being used for data interchange between epn members , the common format forms the basis of a pulse profile archive presently being maintained at the max - planck - institut fr radioastronomie in bonn .",
    "the idea of the archive is to build up a useful collection of pulse profiles which anybody with access to the _ internet _ can use .",
    "presently , around 2500 pulse profiles are stored in this format .",
    "the profiles themselves have usually already been , or about to be , published so that full credit for any subsequent use via the database can go to the contributing authors .",
    "the archive has the following url address : _ http://www.mpifr - bonn.mpg.de / pulsar / data/_. authors are encouraged to make their data available to this archive and should contact duncan lorimer ( email : _",
    "dunc@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de_ ) if they wish to do this .",
    "we thank the referee , dick manchester , for useful comments on an earlier version of the manuscript .",

    "to incorporate the capability to read and write data in this format within existing analysis software , a simple routine exists which can read and write data in this format . in addition , we have written some sample programs which can plot the data and display the header parameters .",
