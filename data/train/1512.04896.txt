    "the notion of diquark is as old as the quark model itself .",
    "gell - mann @xcite mentioned the possibility of diquarks in his original paper on quarks , just as the possibility of tetra and pentaquark . soon afterwards , ida and kobayashi @xcite and lichtenberg and tassie @xcite introduced effective degrees of freedom of diquarks in order to describe baryons as composed of a constituent diquark and quark .",
    "since its introduction , many articles have been written on this subject @xcite up to the most recent ones @xcite .",
    "but most important , different phenomenological indications for diquark correlations have been collected during the years , such as some regularities in hadron spectroscopy , the @xmath0 rule in weak nonleptonic decays @xcite , some regularities in parton distribution functions and in spin - dependent structure functions @xcite and in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 fragmentation functions .. finally , although the phenomenon of color superconductivity @xcite in quark dense matter can not be considered an argument in support of diquarks in the vacuum , it is nevertheless of interest since it stresses the important role of cooper pairs of color superconductivity , which are color antitriplet , flavor antisymmetric , scalar diquarks .",
    "the introduction of diquarks in hadronic physics has some similarities to that of correlated pairs in condensed matter physics ( superconductivity @xcite ) and in nuclear physics ( interacting boson model @xcite ) , where effective bosons emerge from pairs of electrons @xcite and nucleons @xcite , respectively .",
    "most important , any interaction that binds @xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons in the rainbow - ladder approximation of the dse will produce diquarks as can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , moreover there are some indication of diquark confinement @xcite .",
    "recently quark - diquark effective degrees of freedom have shown their usefulness also in the study of transversity problems and fragmentation functions ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , even in an oversimplified form , i.e. with the spatial part of the quark - diquark ground state wave function parametrized by means of a gaussian .",
    "even if the microscopic origin of that effective degree of freedom of diquark , it is not completely clear , nevertheless , as in nuclear physics , one may attempt to correlate the data in terms of a phenomenological model , and in many cases it has already shown it usefulness . in this article , we will review the interacting quark diquark model in its original formulation @xcite , since the point form relativistic reformulation it has been already discussed in another contribution of the same conference ( see ferretti and santopinto ) .",
    "we shall focus on its differences and extension to the strange spectra .",
    "we will point out some important consequences on the ratio of the electric and magnetic form factor of the proton , that is a zero at @xmath5 , while impossible with three quark model such as that of ref.ref .",
    "the new @xmath6 experiment planned at jlab will eventually shed light on the diquark structure of the nucleon . + finally by comparing the number of @xmath7 s states predicted by the relativistic interacting quark diquark model , that are only a subset of those predicted by three - quark models , we will try to suggest a next generation pentaquark analysis that evaluates the systematic error on the background due to the missing @xmath7 s states .",
    "the missing @xmath7 resonances can not change the structures seen in the dalitz plot but eventually only modify some parameters .",
    "the various aspects of the hadron structures have been investigated by many experimental and theoretical approaches in the last years .",
    "the observations of the hadron states with an exotic structure have attracted a lot interest . in particular , regarding the light flavor region , we can remind the exotic states found in the accelerator facilities such as the scalar mesons @xmath8 and @xmath9,or the @xmath10 which are expected to have an exotic structure as multiquarks , hadronic molecules , but also hybrid states and so forth @xcite , while regarding the exotic heavy hadrons , we can cite states such as the @xmath11 @xcite and @xmath12 @xcite which can not be explained by the simple quark model picture .",
    "in addition , there are the pentaquark states , seen by lhcb  @xcite , with quark content @xmath13 .    in parallel ,",
    "recently , theoretical approaches based on qcd have been strongly developed .",
    "the chiral effective field theory respecting the chiral symmetry provides the hadron - hadron scatterings at low energy with the nambu - goldstone bosons exchange .",
    "this is a powerful tool to investigate hadronic molecules as the meson - meson  @xcite , meson - baryon  @xcite , and baryon - baryon  @xcite states appearing near thresholds . on the other side",
    ", lattice qcd performs ab initio calculation for hadron spectroscopy , even if it is not easy to approach hadron states at the physical pion mass or with heavy flavor .",
    "nevertheless , the recent progress of the lattice simulations are really impressive and hadron structures and interactions have been discussed extensively in refs .",
    "+ finally , in the last part of this article , we will discuss briefly some new results obtained within the formalism of the unquenched quark model ( uqm ) : when lqcd or chiral effective models can not be applied , it can provide anyway predictions , making up with the three quark model defects . +",
    "the model will be discussed as an attempt to arrive to a systematic description and correlation of data in term of q - diquark effective degrees of freedom by formulating a quark- diquark model with explicit interactions , in particular with a direct and an exchange interaction .",
    "we will show the spectrum which emerges from this model . in respect to the prediction shown in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extended our calculation up to 2.4 gev , and so we have predicted more states .",
    "up to an energy of about @xmath14 , the diquark can be described as two correlated quarks with no internal spatial excitations @xcite .",
    "then , its color - spin - flavor wave function must be antisymmetric . moreover , as we consider only light baryons , made up of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 quarks , the internal group is restricted to su@xmath18(6 ) .",
    "if we denote spin by its value , flavor and color by the dimension of the representation , the quark has spin @xmath19 , flavor @xmath20 , and color @xmath21 .",
    "the diquark must transform as @xmath22 under su@xmath23(3 ) , hadrons being color singlets .",
    "then , one only has the symmetric su@xmath18(6 ) representation @xmath24(s ) , containing @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , i.e. the scalar and axial - vector diquarks , respectively .",
    "this is because we think of the diquark as two correlated quarks in an antisymmetric nonexcited state .",
    "we assume that the baryons are composed of a valence quark and a valence diquark ,    the relative configurations of two body can be described by the relative coordinate @xmath29 and its conjugate momenta @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian contains a direct and an exchange interaction .",
    "the direct interaction is coulomb plus linear interaction , while the exchange one is of the type spin - spin , isospin - isospin etc .",
    "a contact term has to be present to describe the splitting between the nucleon and the @xmath31 : @xmath32 for a purely coulomb - like interaction the problem is analytically solvable .",
    "the solution is trivial , with eigenvalues @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the reduced mass of the diquark - quark configuration and @xmath35 the principal quantum number .",

    "the unquenching of cqm were initially done by trnqvist and collaborators , who used an unitarized quark model @xcite , while van beveren and rupp used an t - matrix approach @xcite .",

    "it is via these hadronic loops that the bare states become `` dressed '' and the hadronic loop contributions totally dominate the dynamics of the process .",
    "a similar approach was developed by pennington in ref .",

    "@xcite , the constant pair - creation strength in the operator ( [ eqn : psi - a ] ) was substituted with an effective one , to suppress unphysical heavy quark pair - creation .",
    "the introduction of continuum effects in the cqm can thus be essential to study observables that only depend on @xmath116 sea pairs , like the strangeness content of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors @xcite or the flavor asymmetry of the nucleon sea @xcite it has been discussed in another contribution of the same conference ( see garca - tecocoatzi et al . ) .",

    "the inclusion of the continuum higher fock components has a dramatic effect on the spin content of the proton @xcite .",
    "whereas in the cqm the proton spin is carried entirely by the ( valence ) quarks , while in the unquenched calculation 67.6 % is carried by the quark and antiquark spins and the remaining 32.4 % by orbital angular momentum . the orbital angular momentum due to the relative motion of the baryon with respect to the meson accounts for 31.7 % of the proton spin , whereas the orbitally excited baryons and mesons in the intermediate state only contribute 0.7 % .",
    "finally we note , that the orbital angular momentum arises almost entirely from the relative motion of the nucleon and @xmath31 resonance with respect to the @xmath3-meson in the intermediate states .",

    "@xcite we were the first to predict analogous states ( as @xmath133 ) with strong continuum components in the bottomonium sector but in the @xmath135 sector , due to opening of threshold of @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we expect similar interesting effects near threshold also in the @xmath139 sector .",
