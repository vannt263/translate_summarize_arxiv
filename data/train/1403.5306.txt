    "intermediate mass black hole ( imbh ) binary systems represent a potential strong source of gravitational radiation accessible to ground - based interferometric detectors such as the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite and virgo  @xcite .",
    "although yet to be discovered , binary systems with total masses in the range @xmath8 could form in dense star clusters such as globular clusters  @xcite .",
    "the coalescence of a compact binary system generates a gravitational wave signal consisting of a low frequency inspiral phase when the compact objects are in orbit around each other , a merger phase marking the coalescence of the objects and the peak gravitational wave emission , and a high frequency ringdown phase after the objects have formed a single perturbed black hole  @xcite . for low mass systems ,",
    "most of the signal - to - noise ratio comes from the inspiral phase of the coalescence .",
    "several searches for gravitational waves from the inspiral of low mass compact objects have been performed by ligo and virgo  @xcite . however , since the merger frequency is inversely proportional to the mass of the system , it is shifted to lower frequencies for higher mass binaries .",
    "searches for gravitational waves from the inspiral , merger and ringdown of binary black holes with total masses @xmath9 have also been performed in ligo - virgo data  @xcite .    for an imbh binary ,",
    "typically only the merger and ringdown parts of the signal fall above the low frequency cutoff of @xmath10hz for the initial ligo and virgo detectors .",
    "thus it is sufficient to conduct a search solely for these particular phases of the gravitational wave signal  @xcite .",
    "a binary black hole merger is expected to result in a single perturbed black hole , and black hole perturbation theory and numerical simulations provide us with a well - understood ringdown signal model , a superposition of quasinormal modes that decay exponentially with time  @xcite",
    ". indeed , any perturbed black hole , not just that produced by a compact merger ( e.g. , a black hole formed as the result of the core collapse of a very massive star  @xcite ) , will emit ringdown gravitational waves described by its quasinormal modes .    since the gravitational waveform of perturbed black holes has a well - defined model , the method of matched filtering",
    "is used to search for ringdown signals .",
    "the first such search was carried out on data from the fourth ligo science run ( s4 ) which took place between february 22 and march 24 , 2005  @xcite .",
    "additionally , two burst searches with less - constrained waveform models looked for gravitational waves from mergers of imbhs in data collected by ligo and virgo between 2005 and 2010  @xcite .",
    "no events were observed in these searches . in this paper , we present the results of a matched filter ringdown search of data from ligo s fifth and sixth science runs and virgo s science runs 2 and 3 .",
    "we compare the resulting rate upper limits to the previous searches for gravitational waves from imbhs .",

    "section  [ sec : data ] provides a brief description of the detectors and their sensitivities during the data collection epochs .",
    "section [ sec : search ] describes the search , and results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "upper limits are presented in section [ sec : ul ] and discussed in section [ sec : summary ] .      observed black holes of known masses fall into two broad mass ranges .",
    "stellar mass black holes have masses @xmath11  @xmath12m@xmath13  @xcite although theoretical modeling of stellar evolution and population synthesis raises the possibility that significantly heavier stellar black holes could exist  @xcite .",
    "supermassive black holes have masses @xmath14  @xmath15m@xmath13  @xcite and are thought to be cosmological in origin , possibly formed through galactic mergers leading to their growth through coalescences and accretion  @xcite .",
    "the large gap between the mass ranges of stellar and supermassive black holes is predicted to be populated by an elusive class of objects known as intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs )  @xcite .",
    "observational evidence from ultra- or hyper - luminous x - ray sources and star cluster dynamics suggest a population of imbhs with masses in the range @xmath16m@xmath13 to @xmath17m@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "ultra - luminous x - ray sources with angle - averaged fluxes many times that of a stellar mass black hole accreting at the eddington limit @xmath18erg@xmath19s@xmath20 may be explained by black holes with masses larger than any known stellar mass black hole . the brightest known hyper - luminous x - ray source and",
    "the strongest imbh candidate is the point - like x - ray source hlx-1 .",
    "its maximum x - ray luminosity of @xmath21erg@xmath19s@xmath6 requires a black hole mass @xmath14  a  few @xmath22m@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "other hyper - luminous x - ray sources include m82 x-1  @xcite , cartwheel n10  @xcite , and cxo j122518.6  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the excess of dark mass at the centers of globular clusters could be explained by @xmath23m@xmath13 imbhs formed from repeated mergers between other compact objects and/or stars  @xcite .",
    "however , both hyper - luminous x - ray sources and central globular cluster masses can be explained via phenomena that do not include imbhs  @xcite .",
    "still , most observational evidence for globular cluster imbhs using radio emissions can place upper bounds of @xmath24m@xmath13  @xcite , and do not rule out lower mass systems that are above the expected maximum mass of a normal stellar mass black hole  @xcite .",
    "thus , the existence of imbhs currently remains speculative .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that imbh binaries could form in collisional runaway scenarios in young dense star clusters .",
    "initially , in young star clusters , imbhs could form via the runaway collapse of very massive stars  @xcite .",
    "after separate formation , two imbhs could settle to the core of the cluster through dynamical friction and form a common binary via dynamical interactions .",
    "the binary would tighten due to three - body encounters , finally merging quickly via gravitational radiation  @xcite .    from  @xcite , we know that the astrophysical rate of imbh binary coalescence in globular clusters ( gc ) should be no higher than @xmath25gc@xmath6gyr@xmath6 assuming that all globular clusters are sufficiently massive and have a sufficient binary fraction to form this type of binary once in their lifetime of @xmath26gyr  @xcite .",
    "also , globular clusters have a space density of roughly @xmath27gc@xmath19mpc@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "this allows us to convert the astrophysical upper limit to @xmath28mpc@xmath5yr@xmath6 .",
    "if we assume that only 10% of globular clusters meet these requirements , the rate would still be as high as one tenth this value  @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations also suggest the possibility of forming intermediate mass ratio inspirals ( imris ) ( e.g. , a coalescence of an imbh with a compact stellar mass companion ) in these same dense star clusters .",
    "this occurs through a combination of gravitational wave emission , binary exchange processes , and secular evolution of hierarchical triple systems  @xcite .",
    "ringdown searches in the advanced detector era could be important for detecting imris , particularly if the inspiraling companion is a black hole with @xmath29  @xmath30m@xmath13 or if the system is a compact object coalescing with a slowly - spinning imbh with @xmath29  @xmath31m@xmath13  @xcite .",
    "a black hole can be perturbed in a variety of ways , e.g. , by interaction with a companion , by accretion or infall of matter , or in its formation through asymmetric gravitational collapse .",
    "a perturbed kerr black hole will emit gravitational waves , relaxing to a stable configuration through radiation generated by a superposition of quasinormal modes of oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the emitted gravitational waves are exponentially decaying sinusoid signals characterized by a complex angular frequency @xmath32 from which we can derive both the real frequency @xmath33 and the quality factor @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the spheroidal harmonic indices and @xmath38 denotes the overtones of each mode",
    ". overtones with @xmath39 are generally negligible in amplitude compared with the fundamental @xmath40 mode .",
    "numerical simulations have demonstrated that the @xmath41 fundamental mode dominates the gravitational wave emission , particularly in the case of an equal mass compact object merger  @xcite .",
    "the ringdown search uses single - mode waveform templates . however , other modes can contribute significantly to the gravitational wave signal , particularly in cases where the binary s mass ratio @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "reference  @xcite reports that single - mode templates can result in a loss @xmath45 in detected events over a significant mass range and also result in large errors in the estimated values of parameters ( especially the quality factor ) .",
    "a multimode ringdown search would perform better both in efficiency and parameter estimation  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the single - mode ringdown search will still provide good sensitivity to comparable mass binary systems ( see average sensitive distances given in section  [ sec : eobul ] ) .",

    "<S> we report results from a search for gravitational waves produced by perturbed intermediate mass black holes ( imbh ) in data collected by ligo and virgo between 2005 and 2010 . </S>",
    "<S> the search was sensitive to astrophysical sources that produced damped sinusoid gravitational wave signals , also known as ringdowns , with frequency @xmath0 and decay timescale @xmath1 characteristic of those produced in mergers of imbh pairs . </S>",
    "<S> no significant gravitational wave candidate was detected . </S>",
    "<S> we report upper limits on the astrophysical coalescence rates of imbhs with total binary mass @xmath2 and component mass ratios of either 1:1 or 4:1 . for systems with total mass @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we report a 90%-confidence upper limit on the rate of binary imbh mergers with non - spinning and equal mass components of @xmath4mpc@xmath5yr@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we also report a rate upper limit for ringdown waveforms from perturbed imbhs , radiating 1% of their mass as gravitational waves in the fundamental , @xmath7 , oscillation mode , that is nearly three orders of magnitude more stringent than previous results . </S>"
