    "the x - ray imaging telescope art - p was one of the two main instruments on board the granat observatory , which was launched in 1989 .",
    "the telescope consists of four coaxial , completely independent modules ; each module includes a coded mask , a collimator and a position - sensitive detector ( energy band is @xmath13 - 100 kev ) with a geometric area of 625 @xmath2 .",
    "the detector equipped with the vessel , window , the analog and digital electronics units .",
    "the vessel is made of 4 mm thickness of the titan , which covers a 1.5 mm of the tin as a shield .",
    "the collimator has a dual role , it acts as a support structure for the thin window against the internal pressure of the detector and it limits the field of view . the collimator cell geometry is chosen to be square with 6@xmath36 mm .",
    "the material of the collimator is a copper with thickness of 200 @xmath4 m .",
    "the analysis of the archive data obtained with art - p in 1990 - 1992 has shown that more than 100 x - ray bursts and flares were detected during this period ( grebenev et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "most of them were identified as type i x - ray bursts from low - mass x - ray binaries , but also we found six unusual events .",
    "comparison of them with the phebus / granat instrument data , obtained in the 80 - 600 kev energy band ( terekhov et al . , 1996 ) , has allowed us to conclude that the telescope art - p detected solar flares passed through its side shield .",
    "time profiles of several of them were practically the same in a wide energy range ( 3 - 600 kev ) , whereas profiles of other flares in high and low energy bands differed considerably ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the solar flares observed by phebus instrument and art - p telescope on may 24 , 1990 was of our special interest .",
    "this event is associated with a limb flare ( n33 w78 ) , where gev protons were observed in interplanetary space and the largest increase due to solar neutrons was recorded at ground levels . the spectrum obtained with art - p during this flare",
    "is shown in fig.2 ( _ left panel _ ) . as is obvious from the figure that the powerful emission feature near 9 kev is present in the flare spectrum .",
    "this feature was interpreted as the k - fluorescence line produced by the copper .",
    "such point of view is supported by the _",
    "right panel _ of fig.2 , in which the counts distribution along one of the detector axis are shown .",
    "the 6mm - collimator structure is obvious from this figure .    the detailed analysis of other solar flares detected by the art - p telescope and the evaluating of possibility to detect solar flares or powerful gamma - ray bursts during the integral and srg missions now in progress ."
