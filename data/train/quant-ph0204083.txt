    "the ability to transfer a quantum state from one system to another will be a useful tool in the future of quantum information , both for quantum communication and for building large quantum computers from smaller components .",
    "various schemes have been proposed for transferring quantum states @xcite , some of which are based on teleportation and entanglement purification .",
    "others are more direct , having a quantum channel ( typically an optical fiber ) connecting the two systems , and classical control pulses applied to each system ensure that emission from the first system and absorption by the second are perfect .    over long distances",
    ", it appears that protocols based on teleportation and purification are necessarily more efficient than direct schemes @xcite , but over short distances ( e.g. for interconnects between quantum components ) , the more direct method , first proposed by cirac _",
    "et al_. @xcite , may be practical , and is probably easier to implement since it does not require quantum measurement . the scheme by cirac _ et al_.  @xcite implements quantum state transfer  from one atom located inside an optical cavity to another atom in a separate but connected cavity , mediated by raman transitions via an atomic state ( outside the computational basis ) as well as cavity and external photons , and is controlled by laser pulses incident on each atom . the transfer is therefore subject to amplitude and phase errors in the control pulses .",
    "the idea @xcite is also applicable to single - electron spin based systems in semiconductors , with additional uses such as spin measurement @xcite , and as a controllable source of decoherence for initial state preparation .",
    "the intermediate state required for spin - flip raman transitions between single electron spin states is a state known as a trion @xcite .",
    "this state is a bound state of two electrons and a single hole , and couples to the single electron spin states via @xmath0- and @xmath1-polarised light .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the optical excitation of an exciton which may form a bound state with the electron , very much akin to an h@xmath2 complex .",
    "trion states have been observed experimentally in gaas @xcite , and are relatively long lived , and so the scheme has the potential to be realised in semiconductor systems .    in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of the effect of two possible types of stochastic error in control pulses , and consider a method for reducing the sensitivity of the pulse to such errors .",
    "our results show that it is possible to design pulse shapes that reduce the sensitivity of the transfer process to certain sources of errors in the pulse .",
    "we give a short account of the applicability of this scheme to a semiconductor device .    in section [ sec : qst ] we briefly review the proposal for quantum state transfer  given by @xcite and give a new analytic form for a laser control pulse shape that implements quantum state transfer . in section [ sec : stochasticnoise ]",
    "we formulate a master equation for the transfer subject to stochastic errors in the control pulse , and use the master equation to compute the sensitivity of the transfer process to such errors . in section [ sec : optimise ] we present a procedure to optimise the pulse shape to reduce the sensitivity of the transfer to control pulse errors .",

    "figure [ fig : eta1 ] shows the noise sensitivity , @xmath126 , for each of the pulses in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulse1 ] . naturally , the value of @xmath144 gets closer to zero ( i.e. better ) as the number of optimisation points is increased , and it also gets better as the width of the pulse increases .",
    "it may be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : ampcorr ] which shows the noise sensitivity for the two analytic solutions discussed earlier and the optimisation process has clearly produced pulses that are significantly less sensitive to noise in the laser pulses than either of the analytic solutions discussed earlier in this paper .",
    "the best pulse shape computed in the optimisations performed here is that with @xmath161 , and has the limit @xmath162 as @xmath73 .",
    "it appears that the optimisation procedure selects solutions with lower amplitudes , and this occurs because the form of noise we have assumed in this set of examples is proportional to the amplitude of the control pulse , thus lowering the amplitude tends to lower the effect of the noise .",
    "figure [ fig : beta ] shows that the photon wave - packet transmitted between the cavities , which is proportional to @xmath163 , becomes broader .",
    "it may be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) and ( [ eq : redevol ] ) that @xmath164 , and the numerical solutions satisfy this to around one part in @xmath165 .",
    "figure [ fig : extrapolation ] plots the limiting value of @xmath166 versus @xmath158 , the time after which @xmath167 is zero , for the three - point ( light ) and six - point ( dark ) optimisations .",
    "the solid curves are fitted using a function of the form @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are fitting parameters . in both cases ,",
    "the surprisingly close fit has @xmath171 to better than one part in @xmath172 , suggesting that the ultimate limit to the optimisation process is an infinitely wide pulse with @xmath173 .",
    "this indicates that the effect of the noise can not be removed by allowing the pulse duration to become infinitely long .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : optimum ] above show that there is a clear possibility of selecting pulse shapes that are more or less sensitive to fluctuations therein .",
    "figures [ fig : ampcorr ] and [ fig : timecorr ] show that pulses which perform better with respect to one source of error may perform worse with respect to another , so in a realistic implementation of the optimisations presented here , detailed knowledge of the sources of stochastic error in the pulses would be required .",
    "the reduction in transfer error from an optimised pulse is moderate in the case of white amplitude noise considered here , reducing the error in the transfer by a factor of a little over two compared to the original pulse shape presented by cirac _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "though this is not a very large improvement , regardless of the shape chosen , pulse shaping will be needed to implement quantum state transfer , and so it is prudent to select the pulse with lowest noise sensitivity .",
    "the order of magnitude of transfer errors produced by the pulse are set by the magnitude of @xmath174 , which is essentially the relative variance of the pulse fluctuations , integrated over time . as mentioned earlier , for white amplitude noise , one candidate that could produce",
    "this is intrinsic amplitude fluctuations in the laser . for a cw laser , this can almost immediately be ruled out as a legitimate error source , since the relative rms amplitude lasers in e.g. a diode laser are of order @xmath175 @xcite , so the variance is @xmath176 , which is completely negligible .",
    "a more likely source of error may be due to either the pulse generator or the pulse shaper . whilst the original proposal for quantum state transfer  was based on atomic states",
    ", we have had in mind the application of this scheme to electron spin states confined to quantum dots , with the dots contained within a linear microcavity , in a similar scheme to that illustrated by benson _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and suggested by imamoglu",
    "_ et al_.  @xcite . for a cavity of length 1 @xmath177 m ,",
    "the free spectral range is around @xmath178 hz , and if we imagine one of the bragg mirrors has transmissivity of @xmath172 , then the cavity loss rate is around @xmath179 .",
    "this is an optimistic but not unreasonable estimate for the transmissivity , e.g. lidzey _ et al_.  @xcite report a microcavity @xmath180-factor of 125 ( based on a cavity linewidth of @xmath181 mev and a mode frequency of 2.88 ev ) for a @xmath182 cavity , which corresponds to a mirror transmissivity of @xmath183 @xcite , and good quality cavity linewidths may be as low as 0.5 mev @xcite , corresponding to @xmath184 . since @xmath185 sets the time scale of the control pulse ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : optimum ] ) , the typical width of the pulse is @xmath186 ps .",
    "weiner @xcite gives a relation for the shortest temporal feature that one may generate as @xmath187 where @xmath158 is the largest temporal window , and @xmath130 is a measure of the potential complexity of the pulse .",
    "typical values are quoted as @xmath188 ps , which is the same order of magnitude as @xmath185 , and @xmath189 , so @xmath190 s. thus , if we assert that fluctuations at time scales less than @xmath191 are uncontrolled , then an upper estimate on relative amplitude fluctuations might be @xmath192 , which means that uncontrolled relative amplitude fluctuations from the pulse shaper could be as large as @xmath193 , which is certainly not negligible .",
    "we note in passing that the time scale of 10 ps is roughly coincident with the characteristic time required for an electron in a travelling quantum dot generated by a surface acoustic wave ( saw ) ( velocity @xmath194 m s@xmath195 ) , to traverese a distance of 1 @xmath177 m , which is the typical dimension of a saw wavelength @xcite , as well as a typical minimum spot size for an optical cw laser at its focal point . therefore , if a microcavity were constructed at the end of the saw based quantum computer proposed in @xcite , then a cw laser focused at the center of the microcavity with a cross - sectional intensity profile shaped such that an electron passing through the microcavity experiences a time varying electric field which implements quantum state transfer  ( e.g eq .",
    "( [ eq : g1sol ] ) ) , then the quantum state transfer  scheme discussed in this paper could be used for both an interconnect between several saw quantum processors and for electron - spin measurement ( detection of a photon out of the cavity corresponds to a definite spin state of the electron ) .",
    "this paper has been fundamentally concerned with time dependent hamiltonians , which are , conceptually , generally applicable to schemes for implementation of quantum computation .",
    "we therefore suppose that in many quantum gates implemented with time dependent control pulses , there could be some advantage in shaping the control pulses to be minimally sensitive to errors , so the ideas discussed in this paper may well be generalisable to other quantum information applications .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of stochastic noise on a control pulse that implements quantum state transfer  between two atoms or quantum dots .",
    "we have found an alternate analytic solution for laser pulses that implement quantum state transfer , and using the two analytic solutions we have available , we found that although different control pulses are capable of implementing quantum state transfer , they may have different sensitivities to noise , depending both on their shape and the source of the noise .",
    "we then provided a method for calculating pulse shapes with lower noise sensitivities thereby optimising the pulse shape .",
    "this method was demonstrated to produce more optimal control pulses for the case of noise that is proportional to the control pulse amplitude with a white spectrum .",
    "a number of successively better pulse shapes were presented , and extrapolating the improvement in the noise sensitivity to its limit ( i.e. for infinitely wide pulses ) strongly suggests that the influence of this particular form of noise can not be cancelled completely .",
    "we would like to thank g.  milburn for a very helpful discussion , s.  barrett , a.moroz , a.  shields , r.  phillips , p.  littlewood and p.  haynes for fruitful conversations regarding implementation of the ideas presented .",
