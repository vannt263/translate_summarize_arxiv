    "although the final physical results do not depend on the particular choice , it is a matter of convenience to adopt the thermal values @xmath265 for @xmath55 , @xmath266 for @xmath233 , and @xmath267 for @xmath7 and have the correlator flow towards a thermal fixed point .",
    "the renormalized correlator ( [ otwet * ] ) then behaves very differently for large and small dimensions : in @xmath7 the transverse scale @xmath109 does not change ( as we chose @xmath268 ) and the initial correlator of width @xmath76 is replaced with a new correlator of width @xmath269 .",
    "this contrasts with the situation in @xmath55 where @xmath109 does rescale ( as we chose @xmath270 ) and the physical width of the correlator increases with @xmath169 to follow the mean thermal displacement amplitude @xmath271 .",
    "for @xmath233 the physical width grows only logarithmically .",
    "the flow ( [ otwet * ] ) indicates that the thermal fixed point is unstable as the amplitude of the disorder grows exponentially under the frg transformation .",
    "as the nonlinear terms in ( [ frgk ] ) become large beyond the scale @xmath272 we can not neglect them any longer and the flow crosses over to approach the disorder dominated fixed point ( the wandering exponent @xmath61 then has to be modified accordingly , @xmath273 for random bond disorder @xcite ) .",
    "the pinning length @xmath206 replaces the @xmath12 larkin length @xmath139 and can be found from a comparison of linear and quadratic terms in the flow equation ( [ frgk ] ) , @xmath274 making use of the result ( [ otwet * ] ) .",
    "it is easily verified that the crossover condition ( [ crosscond ] ) together with the explicit solution ( [ otwet * ] ) of the linearized flow equations then yields the results ( [ lct ] ) for the crossover length @xmath206 obtained above with the help of scaling arguments .",
    "note that for @xmath50 the linear term @xmath275 in ( [ frgk ] ) gains in importance as we integrate through the larkin regime , hence thermal rounding persists on all scales @xmath276 . on the contrary , for @xmath7",
    "the thermal rounding term is most important at small scales @xmath277 where it quickly replaces the width @xmath76 of the correlator by the mean thermal displacement amplitude @xmath278 ; upon further scaling the effective temperature decreases and at the larkin scale the thermal term is down by a factor of @xmath279 .",
    "this again reflects the different role the temperature plays for different internal dimensions of the elastic manifold .",
    "finally , let us see how the high temperature creep ( as characterized by the temperature dependent critical force density @xmath6 for @xmath50 ) appears directly from the dynamic frg treatment .",
    "the analysis parallels the treatment at low temperatures , however , we have to be more careful in distinguishing between the cases @xmath50 and @xmath7 .",
    "let us analyze the flow of the force correlator @xmath280 .",
    "following the full flow up to @xmath281 the force correlator assumes a shape with a height and width as given by ( [ otwet * ] ) . at @xmath281 the non - linear terms in the flow equation ( [ frgk ] ) have become important ; beyond @xmath281 the correlator quickly flows towards the disorder dominated fixed point function @xmath282 , the linear temperature term @xmath283 smoothing the flow in a region of size @xmath284 around the origin .",
    "assuming again that the fixed point function @xmath282 derives is rough shape from the correlator @xmath285 at crossover , we can use the result ( [ otwet * ] ) in combination with the flow equation ( [ static ] ) to find the characteristic features @xmath286 , @xmath143 , and @xmath287 of the fixed point function and the rounding parameters @xmath288 and @xmath284 of the cusp .    using ( [ otwet * ] ) and the crossover condition ( [ crosscond ] ) we find the height @xmath289 .",
    "the slope of the fixed point function at @xmath290 again follows from comparing terms in the flow equation , @xmath291 @xmath292 and we find the width @xmath293 @xmath294 , see also the result ( [ otwet * ] ) .",
    "the width @xmath136 of thermal rounding derives from @xmath295 and we find the result @xmath296 in @xmath50 , with @xmath297 and @xmath61 the random manifold exponent ; thus at @xmath281 the width of thermal rounding equals the width of the correlator , @xmath298 .",
    "the curvature @xmath299 is correspondingly small , @xmath300 , see fig .  2 ; comparing this result with eq .",
    "( [ curvature ] ) we conclude that the barriers ` saturate ' to follow the temperature , @xmath301 .",
    "this is quite different from @xmath7 : here , the thermal rounding affects only the narrow regime @xmath302 around the origin and the curvature is already large at @xmath281 , @xmath303 , where @xmath304 .",
    "thus , as anticipated above , the curvature of the correlator at @xmath281 is thermally reduced to the order of @xmath305 in @xmath50 while it is large in @xmath7 .",
    "hence for @xmath7 the situation at high temperatures @xmath306 is not different from that at low temperatures .",
    "next we integrate the flow for the velocity and force parameters @xmath93 and @xmath189 .",
    "we determine the creep scale @xmath307 twice , using the condition @xmath308 to relate the velocity @xmath8 and the scale @xmath307 and a second time from the onset of the disorder term in the force equation ( [ fld ] ) , providing a relation between @xmath3 and @xmath307 ; combining these results we obtain the desired velocity - force characteristics . in doing so , we have to be careful to use the above high temperature estimates for @xmath287 in eqs .",

    "the simple behavior of the creep barrier close to threshold appears surprising  considering the ` non - trivial ' threshold exponents due to a diverging nucleus obtained for elastic manifolds trapped in a washboard potential ( see ref .  ) one is tempted to expect a non - trivial exponent for the random case as well . however , from our analysis we conclude that there is no new diverging scale associated with creep near threshold .",
