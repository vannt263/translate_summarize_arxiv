    "in recent years , considerable work has been devoted to the study of the chandrasekhar - mass ( @xmath5 ) model of type  ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) .",
    "as shown by @xcite , prompt detonations of @xmath5 carbon / oxygen ( c+o ) white dwarfs ( wds ) in hydrostatic equilibrium mainly produce iron group elements ( iges ) .",
    "thus , they can not account for the significant amounts of intermediate - mass elements ( imes ; e.g.  silicon and sulphur ) responsible for the features which dominate the maximum light spectra . to obtain these",
    ", pre - expansion of the wd is necessary such that burning partially takes place under low - density conditions where imes can be synthesized .",
    "one way of achieving this is provided by models in which the flame ignites as a deflagration which releases sufficient energy to expand the star before a deflagration - to - detonation transition occurs ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative to this pre - expansion is the detonation of a sub - chandrasekhar mass ( sub-@xmath5 ) wd starting from a hydrostatic configuration . here , a variety of density profiles can be realized , determined by the wd mass .",
    "close to @xmath5 , the detonation produces primarily iges and few imes , while for less massive wds more imes and less iges will be synthesized .",
    "detonation of a sub-@xmath5 wd can not occur spontaneously but must be triggered by external compression .",
    "the most widely discussed mechanism for sub-@xmath5 explosions has been the _",
    "double detonation _ model . here",
    ", a c+o  wd accretes from a companion star and develops a helium - rich outer shell",
    ". this may occur for binaries with helium - rich donors or hydrogen - rich donors where the accreted hydrogen is burned to helium . if the helium - shell becomes sufficiently massive , it can become unstable and detonate .",
    "subsequent compression of the core by inward propagating shocks may produce a secondary carbon detonation which explodes the wd ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "detonations in helium - rich surface layers have also been discussed for the case of rapid dynamical mass transfer in binary systems containing a c+o  wd with a helium - rich wd companion @xcite . in that case instabilities in the accretion seed dense knots",
    "which , by impacting on the underlying wd surface , might trigger a detonation in the accreted helium leading to a potential secondary core detonation .",
    "it has also been speculated that sub-@xmath5 explosions may arise during violent accretion in mergers of c+o  wd binaries . here",
    ", the c+o accretion may lead to an edge - lit detonation or carbon flashes that trigger a core detonation ( see e.g.  @xcite but for a different result see @xcite ) .    most previous work on testing sub-@xmath5 models",
    "has focused on cases in which the core detonation is triggered by detonation in an overlying massive shell ( @xmath6 ) of helium ( e.g. @xcite ) . in those models burning in the helium shell synthesizes significant masses of @xmath1ni in the outer ejecta , leading to spectra and light curves in conflict with observations . as noted in those studies ,",
    "however , these conclusions are strongly dependent on the influence of the shell material .",
    "in particular , they may not be applicable if such a layer is absent ( or much less massive ) or if its post - burning composition lacks @xmath1ni .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that detonation of the helium - shell may be possible for a shell with mass as low as @xmath7 around a @xmath8 c+o core and that the burning produces only @xmath9 of @xmath1ni along with some lighter iges ( @xcite find that even lower atomic - number burning products can dominate in their helium detonations ) .",
    "even for the low shell masses of @xcite , @xcite find that a secondary core detonation is possible . to date , sub-@xmath5 explosions in the absence of a nickel - rich outer layer have not been studied in detail .",
    "@xcite investigated the explosion dynamics of sub-@xmath5 detonations and concluded that their characteristic properties were consistent with sne  ia but they did not perform realistic radiative transfer simulations .",
    "a full treatment of any class of sub-@xmath5 explosion model requires realistic hydrodynamical and nucleosynthesis simulations of the accretion phase , triggering mechanism and subsequent explosion . here , however , we present a simple numerical experiment that is relevant to any class of sub-@xmath5 explosion model . we consider pure detonations of sub-@xmath5 c+o  wds with different masses , neglecting the question of how this detonation is initiated .",
    "this allows us to investigate the idealized case of sub-@xmath5 detonation scenarios in which the observable display is dominated by material produced in the core explosion .",
    "our goal is to determine the extent to which the least ambiguous component of the system , namely the detonation of a sub-@xmath5 c+o  wd , could lead to explosions which are consistent with observations of sne  ia .",
    "to explore the properties of detonations of sub-@xmath5 wds , we set up five hydrostatic models with wd masses @xmath10 ranging from 0.81 to @xmath11 ( see table  [ tab : rt_out ] ) with centrally - ignited detonations .",
    "we performed the simulations in an axisymmetric setup of the full star but as the initial conditions were spherically symmetric and the symmetry is preserved during evolution , our models are one - dimensional .",
    "the simulations were performed with our sne  ia explosion code ( the initial sizes of the computational grid cells are given in table  [ tab : rt_out ] ; see @xcite for technical details ) .",
    "the detonations were represented with the level - set technique @xcite .",
    "this requires as inputs the detonation velocity and the energy release in the burning .",
    "the detonation velocities take into account pathological detonation speeds at high fuel densities @xcite whereas low - density detonations are assumed to be of chapman - jouguet type ( see @xcite for details ) . the energy released by nuclear burning ( @xmath12 ) and the asymptotic kinetic energy of the ejecta ( @xmath13 )",

    "we first computed nucleosynthesis for all five explosion simulations assuming an initial wd composition of uniformly mixed @xmath54c and @xmath55o with equal mass fractions ( `` pure - c+o '' , hereafter ) .",
    "although commonly adopted in type  ia explosion modelling , this composition is not strictly correct since the mass - fraction of @xmath55o is expected to be larger than @xmath54c in the inner regions ( e.g. @xcite ) . for @xmath5 delayed - detonation models , @xcite showed that the c / o - ratio affects the @xmath1ni - mass by @xmath63% and the velocity structure of the ejecta by up to a few @xmath64 .",

    "the structure of the models is very similar to that obtained by @xcite : small masses of stable iges are produced and the mass - shell in which large mass - fractions of imes are produced is fairly extended .",
    "significant ime mass - fractions are present up to almost the highest velocities in all models , consistent with the lower limits on the outer extent of si - rich material discussed by @xcite .",
    "moreover , a clear trend exists whereby the inner boundary of the ime - rich layers lies at higher velocities in the models where the @xmath1ni - mass is larger , the same trend as inferred from observations @xcite .",
    "the most important consequence of @xmath56ne in our c+o+ne model is a substantial increase in the mass of stable iges ( see table  [ tab : rt_out ] and third panel of figure  [ fig : abund ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "these extend over a wide range of mass - coordinate and come at the expense of less @xmath1ni in the inner regions and fewer imes in the outer zones .",
    "for each of the four detonation models that produce @xmath76  m@xmath0 of @xmath1ni , we performed radiative transfer simulations using our monte carlo code ( @xcite ) . for @xmath77  m@xmath0 , we ran simulations for both our pure - c+o and c+o+ne models .",

    "in figure  [ fig : lcs ] we show the ultraviolet - optical - infrared ( _ uvoir _ ) bolometric and the band - limited ( @xmath80 , @xmath2 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86-band ) light curves from our radiative transfer simulations .",
    "maximum light spectra are shown for the same calculations in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "observations of two sne  ia ( sn  2005cf and sn  2004eo ) are shown for comparison in both figures .",
    "the @xmath1ni - masses reported for these objects are significantly different but within the range covered by our models ( @xmath87 for sn  2004eo [ @xcite ] and @xmath88 for sn  2005cf [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "given the simplicity of the underlying explosion simulations , the light curve shapes and colours are in remarkably good agreement with observations .",
    "for @xmath89 , 1.06 and @xmath11 we obtain @xmath2-band rise times of 1820 days , close to observational estimates ( @xmath90 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the peak colours are also close to those observed but slightly redder in @xmath79 compared to @xmath5 models of similar brightness ( c.f .",
    "these results differ from previous studies for sub-@xmath5 models where relatively rapid rise times ( see e.g.   @xcite ) and _ blue _ colours ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) were found .",
    "both systematic differences arise due to significant amounts of @xmath1ni present in the outer layers of their models ( see discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our calculations illustrate that _ if _ core detonations can be triggered _ without _ producing large masses of iges in the outer layers then good agreement with observations can be obtained . a modest additional mass of imes or unburned fuel ( @xmath54c , @xmath55o or helium ) in the outer ejecta due to the triggering mechanism would have minor consequences for the spectra .",
    "our maximum light spectra are also in qualitatively good agreement with observations ( figure  [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "the models all show the characteristic si   @xmath3 feature .",
    "moreover , they reproduce the sense of the observed trend whereby the strength of the weaker si   feature at @xmath4 relative to @xmath3 is systematically smaller in brighter events @xcite . in agreement with observations ,",
    "the maximum light spectra show clear features associated with other imes , in particular ca and s. our fainter models also predict o   absorption ( @xmath91 ) as observed in some sne  ia ( including sn  2004eo ; see figure  [ fig : spec ] ) but this feature becomes weak for our brighter models , a trend also consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "as expected from figure  [ fig : abund ] , there is a tendency for higher velocities of ime features in brighter events .",
    "velocities for si   @xmath3 measured from our spectra are given in table  [ tab : rt_out ] and are generally compatible with those inferred from observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the si velocity for our pure - c+o @xmath65 model is slightly too high for both sn  2004eo and sn  2005cf .",
    "however , this discrepancy is small and on the scale of the differences between the models ( the observed line velocities are bracketed by those in our @xmath89 and @xmath92 maximum light spectra ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wl ] shows the @xmath2-band width - luminosity relationship obtained from our models compared with the properties of a sample of well - observed sne  ia @xcite .",
    "the models reproduce the correct systematic trend : brighter models have light curves which decline more slowly . compared to the observations the more massive models ( @xmath77 and @xmath11 ) have @xmath42 larger than observed for their brightness .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath42 is a particularly challenging quantity to model precisely and systematic uncertainties in the radiative transfer simulations can affect this quantity significantly .",
    "for example , applying different radiative transfer codes to the well - known w7 model @xcite , which is widely regarded as a good standard for normal sne  ia , yields @xmath42-values that differ by several tenths of a magnitude ( see e.g. figure 7 of @xcite ) . moreover , the values obtained are also too large compared to those of normal sne  ia ( e.g. yields @xmath93 ) .",
    "the predicted width - luminosity relation is also affected by details of the initial wd as illustrated by our c+o+ne test model .",
    "compared to the equivalent pure - c+o model , this model declines more slowly in b - band and is fainter .",
    "this effect is sufficient to move this model to the opposite side of the observed width - luminosity relation ( figure  [ fig : wl ] ) .",
    "thus there may be potential for better agreement with observations from more detailed studies .",
    "finally , we note that the near - infrared light curves obtained from the models have characteristic features which are in qualitative agreement with observations of sne  ia . for the brighter models ( @xmath89 , 1.06 , @xmath11 ) , the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 light curves show distinct secondary maxima while the faintest model @xmath94 has single peaks .",
    "this is consistent with observations  normal sne  ia show double - peaked near - infrared light curves while sub - luminous events have single maxima ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "also , the difference between the models in the @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86-bands at @xmath2-band maximum light is much smaller than in the optical bands , consistent with the observation that sne  ia are better standard candles at near - infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "the sub-@xmath5 model for sne  ia has much to commend it .",
    "first , it has already been suggested by empirical modelling of bolometric sne  ia light curves @xcite that differing ejecta masses may be required for different sne  ia , a property which the sub-@xmath5 model may explain .",
    "secondly , population synthesis studies predict large numbers of binary systems with accreting c+o  wds : @xcite estimate a galactic rate of @xmath95 for possible explosions of sub-@xmath5 c+o  wds accreting from helium - rich companions .",
    "this is much higher than their estimate of the galactic rate for single - degenerate @xmath5 explosions ( @xmath96 ) and comparable to their estimate of the wd - wd merger rate ( @xmath97 ) in systems that exceed @xmath5 . for comparison ,",
    "the observed galactic rate of sne  ia is @xmath98 ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , sub-@xmath5 models provide a simple physical parameter which could account for the range of observed brightnesses : the mass of the exploding c+o  wd .",
    "this parameter allows for a possible link between the typical brightness of a sn ia and the stellar population in which it resides .",
    "for example , if it can be shown that explosions in binary systems with larger @xmath68 are more often found among young stellar populations relative to their less massive @xmath68 counterparts , the observed correlation of sn ia brightness with host galaxy type ( e.g. , @xcite ) might be explained .",
    "here we have shown that detonations of sub-@xmath5  wds lead to explosions which give a reasonable match to several properties of sne  ia .",
    "specifically , wds with masses between @xmath99 and @xmath100 can reproduce a wide range of brightness with light curves that have rise times and peak colours in roughly the correct range .",
    "in addition , the models reproduce the characteristic spectral features present around maximum light and the observed trend for a higher velocity at the inner boundary of the ime - rich layer in brighter sne  ia @xcite .",
    "although our pure - c+o models yield light curves that fade too fast after maximum , the models predict a width - luminosity relation which behaves in the observed sense and we would argue that the combination of uncertainties in radiative transfer simulations and details of the nucleosynthesis ( which is sensitive to the progenitor composition ) can systematically affect the decline timescale .",
    "thus there is potential for even better agreement with improved modelling .",
    "there are several additional observational constraints that our current models do not address but which should be considered in future studies .",
    "for example , off - centre detonation might lead to observable effects associated with departures from spherical symmetry ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "chemical inhomogeneity of the pre - explosion wd could affect the explosive nucleosynthesis : in particular , significant gravitational settling of @xmath56ne @xcite might yield a layered ejecta structure with a central concentration of neutron - rich isotopes as favoured by observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in conclusion , detonations of naked sub-@xmath5 c+o  wds yield light curves and spectra which are in qualitatively good agreement with the observed properties of sne  ia . the critical question remains whether or not realistic progenitor scenarios in which the optical display is dominated by such an explosion can be established",
    ": it must involve detonation of a wd with a density profile similar to those of our toy models without producing large masses of high - velocity iges . any sub-@xmath5 scenario which meets these criteria will likely be promising in accounting for the observed characteristics of sne  ia .",
