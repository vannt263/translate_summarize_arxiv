    "intermediate and high latitude molecular clouds ( hlcs ) are small and low gas density structures that may be in the transition between molecular to atomic clouds @xcite . most of them appear to be non - star - forming clouds @xcite .",
    "their origins are still not well understood , but a possible explanation is that violent events as supernovae explosions within the galactic disc may throw dust away , which during the free fall phase can merge to form molecular / dust clouds .",
    "this model is known as galactic fountain @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that a typical fountain powered by 100 type ii supernovae from a single ob association may eject material up to @xmath3 kpc @xcite .",

    "@xcite identified 457 hlcs ( including intermediate latitudes ) candidates and @xcite constructed a catalogue of about 100 clouds . in the absence of star formation , distances to the galactic plane and sun",
    "can only be estimated by means of statistical modeling .",

    "an alternative is photometric detection of reddening of stars along the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the lack of direct cloud distances remains a challenge .",
    "the only detected star forming cases at intermediate galactic latitudes are mbm 12 @xcite , which is a small association at @xmath12 , and mbm 20 @xcite at @xmath13 .",

    "models of hvcs also naturally predict lower radial velocity halo clouds ( lvhc ) . similarly to hvcs , expectations are that iras fluxes tend to be lower as compared to hi column densities in lvhcs .",
    "@xcite found lvhcs based on such low dust to gas ratios .",
    "in this paper we communicate the discovery of two embedded clusters in the direction of the low velocity high latitude molecular / hi cloud hrk 81.4 -77.8 @xcite , also known as g @xmath14 or gal @xmath15 - see e.g. simbad .",

    "c 438 is located at the southern border of the molecular cloud . given the relative isolation of hrk 81.4 - 77.8 , halo stars are probably not the driving mechanism responsible for its star formation . besides , the present star formation is most likely the first , since the most massive stars have not yet reached the main sequence ( see fig .",

    "the past motion of hrk 81.4 - 77.8 probably played an important role in the transition from atomic to molecular cloud ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite argue that most hi hvcs are disrupted after falling for 100 myr and moving for @xmath48 kpc .",
    "since star - forming clouds may be successively decelerated due to fragmentation as an infalling cloud is being disrupted , slower clouds tend to be longer - lived because of their low mass - loss rates . on the other hand , the disruption timescale decreases with increasing halo density , as a consequence of dragging forces .",
    "after loss of the hi content the remnants may form a warm ionized lvc in the hot coronal gas and eventually may fall in the ionized galactic disk .    in this sect .",
    "we compute the possible orbital motion of the molecular cloud and its two embedded clusters",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] the cloud orbit in the galactic potential using @xmath49 km / s and null transversal velocities .",
    "this favours a galactic chimney model @xcite for the origin of the cloud , since in this interpretation the coincidence of the cloud and the disc should have occurred @xmath50 myr ago .",
    "note that this locus lies in the inner galactic disk , where a cloud would not be expected to survive disk shocking .    in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we show the cloud motion for @xmath49 km / s together with the proper motions of ucac4 for 2 stars that have counterparts in our decontaminated cmd ( fig .",
    "the available proper motions and other data for the stars in the area of c 439 are given in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "[ f7 ] uses the proper motion of the first and third stars in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "uncertainties are significant , however we tentatively compute the orbit using also this non null components for the transverse velocity .",
    "the orbital solution now points to an extragalactic origin for the cloud .",
    "the computation suggests a disc crossing to have occurred at @xmath51 myr ago , at the less dense outer disc .",
    "such a recent shock of the cloud with the disc together with its survival would imply that the cluster formation @xmath3 myr ago awaited cooling processes . employing the 2nd star in table  [ tab2 ]",
    "the cloud would make a flyby along the galaxy , but our simulation does not consider the deceleration by the drag of the ram pressure exerted by the halo . for the sake of emphasizing the role of uncertainties , we considered the case of null transverse velocity , since the 1st and 3rd stars in table  [ tab2 ] have uncertainties of the order of the values .",
    "no ucac4 counterpart was detected in c 438 .",
    "we conclude that hrk 81.4 - 77.8 is clearly a key object for understanding the high latitude distribution of halo clouds .",
    "the extragalactic clouds , especially the high velocity ones , may have in part origin in the tidal interaction between the magellanic clouds and the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the source of clouds in the smc / lmc would be primarily tidal , while in the galactic disk the chimney effect may be significant .",
    "violent star formation in the lmc and smc will probably produce the chimney effect .",
    "however several hundred of massive stars in the disc",
    "are necessary to throw hrk 81.4 - 77.8 up to the present position , in the sense that multiple generations of star formation are required to develop a sequential supernovae event generating a continuous superwind @xcite . winds from ob stars may also contribute . in this way expanding superbubbles may trigger star formation generating multiple star - forming episodes renewing the fuel source needed for its own expansion and ejecting dust up even more distant @xcite .",
    "after loss of the pressure support the dust may rain on the disc forming a galactic fountain .",
    "we discovered by means of wise two embedded clusters that are located extremely far from the galactic plane .",
    "the clusters appear to represent a star forming event in the high latitude low velocity molecular / hi cloud hrk 81.4 - 77.8 .",
    "we determined intrinsic and orbital parameters for the ensemble . as far as we are aware , this is the first detection of star formation in a high latitude molecular cloud .",
    "the direct determination of distance for such a halo galactic cloud is an unprecedented result .    using wise and 2mass both ecs are @xmath3 myr old and",
    "are located at a distance from the sun of @xmath52 kpc . adopting @xmath5 kpc we derive for c 439 a @xmath53 kpc and spatial components @xmath28 kpc , @xmath29 kpc , and @xmath30 kpc .",
    "c 438 presents @xmath54 kpc and the spatial components @xmath37 kpc , @xmath38 kpc , and @xmath39 kpc .",
    "existing estimates of total or main - clump masses of intermediate - latitude clouds range from @xmath55 to @xmath56 , e.g. mbm 20 ( ldn 1642 ) , mbm 41 - 44 , and mbm 55 @xcite .",
    "thus , our mass estimates for the embedded clusters are comparable . considering the molecular gas to star conversion efficiency of @xmath57 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results imply that high - latitude clouds should be , typically , more massive than the intermediate - latitude counterparts .",
    "a possible reason is the cloud fragmentation by halo dragging forces .",
