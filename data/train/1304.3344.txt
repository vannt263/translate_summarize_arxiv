    "chern - simons gauge theories have attracted attention for a considerable time due to their topological nature@xcite ( in the pure gauge case ) and their possible relation to the quantum hall effect and high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "more recently there has been substantial interest in @xmath2 supersymmetric chern - simons matter theories in the context of the ads / cft correspondence and in particular , a wide range of superconformal theories has been discovered@xcite-@xcite , starting with the blg@xcite and abj / abjm@xcite models .",
    "although a more familiar formulation is in terms of `` quiver''-type gauge theories , many of them may be understood in terms of an underlying `` 3-algebra '' structure@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "explicit perturbative computations to corroborate the superconformal property have been carried out in refs .",
    "@xcite at lowest order ( two loops for a theory in three dimensions ) .",
    "since the gauge coupling is unrenormalised for any chern - simons theory due to the topological nature of the theory , it is only necessary to compute the anomalous dimensions of the chiral fields in order to check for superconformality ( in view of the non - renormalisation theorem ) .",
    "our purpose here is to provide results to enable the extension of this check to the next ( four - loop ) order .",
    "as may readily be imagined , this is a highly non - trivial undertaking .",
    "consequently we envisage an abridged version of the full task .",
    "firstly , we have calculated only the planar diagrams , corresponding to the leading @xmath3 contributions . even then , and even after discarding large classes of diagrams which can be seen in advance not to contribute to the anomalous dimension , one is faced with of the order of a hundred distinct diagrams .",
    "the process of automation which has made it feasible to perform high - loop calculations in non - supersymmetric theories using packages such as mincer is not available to us here ; we are not aware of any available package for performing superspace calculations .",
    "secondly , therefore , we have confined ourselves to computing the coefficients of only a subset ( albeit a large one ) of the invariants contributing to the anomalous dimension .",
    "we believe that the remaining coefficients may be established by _ assuming _ the superconformality of a small number of the known examples of such theories .",
    "armed with the full planar result , one could then continue to check the remaining ones , together with any new examples proposed in future . to put it another way , the conditions required for four - loop superconformality of all the known examples of such theories will form a highly redundant set of consistency conditions .",
    "our lack of knowledge of all the coefficients in the anomalous dimension at this order will reduce this redundancy somewhat but there should be enough remaining to give considerable confidence in the persistence of the superconformality property to this order .",
    "moreover we have tried to facilitate an extension of the check to include further invariants in the anomalous dimension , in the following sense : for the subset of invariants on which we have focussed our attention , we have ( of course ) computed all the diagrams which can contribute .",
    "many of these diagrams also contribute to other invariants , and in these cases we have listed the contributions to these other invariants so that they can readily be combined with the contributions from the remaining diagrams at a later date .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 we describe the general @xmath2 supersymmetric chern - simons theory in three dimensions ; in section 3 we describe our calculations and give our result ; section 4 is devoteed to a discussion of the result and suggestions for future work ; while we explain our conventions and list various useful basic results and identities in an appendix .",
