    "donnachie and landshoff ( dl )  @xcite showed that the energy dependence of all hadron - hadron total cross sections can be described by a simple regge motivated form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are process dependent constants , @xmath3 is the hadron - hadron center - of - mass energy , and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the pomeron ( reggeon ) trajectory intercept .",
    "the @xmath6 dependence on @xmath3 is particularly interesting because of the nature of the photon , which is known to exhibit properties of both a point - like particle ( direct photon ) and a hadron - like state ( resolved photon ) . at the @xmath7 collider hera",
    ", @xmath6 can be extracted from @xmath7 scattering at very low momentum transferred squared at the electron vertex , @xmath8  gev@xmath9 .",
    "the first measurements of the total @xmath10 cross section at hera  @xcite showed that the total photoproduction cross section has a @xmath3 dependence similar to that of hadron - hadron reactions .",
    "further measurements of @xmath6 at hera  @xcite have reduced its statistical errors but the systematic uncertainties remained too large for a precise determination of the @xmath3 dependence of the cross section .",
    "the original fits of dl gave @xmath11 and no uncertainties were determined .",
    "cudell et al .",
    "@xcite , using a data set  @xcite that contained 2747 data points for total cross sections and 303 data points for real part of hadronic amplitudes , determined @xmath12 .",
    "however , only very few points were present for the highest center - of - mass energies .",
    "the data were from different experiments and had a large spread .",
    "furthermore , the value of the pomeron intercept comes out strongly correlated with that of the reggeon trajectories . in another evaluation  @xcite ,",
    "the authors give the range of 0.07 - 0.10 as acceptable values for @xmath13 .",
    "recently , just before the shut - down of the hera collider , runs with different proton energies were taken , at constant positron energy .",
    "this opened up the possibility to determine precisely the power of the @xmath3 dependence by measuring the ratios of cross sections in one experiment , thus having many of the systematic uncertainties canceling out .",
    "the difficulty in measuring total cross section , @xmath14 , in a collider environment originates from the limited acceptance of collider detectors for certain class of processes , in particular for elastic and diffractive scattering , where the final state particles are likely to disappear down the beam - pipe .",
    "the determination of the acceptance relies on monte carlo simulation of the physics and of the detector .",
    "the simulation of the physics is subject to many uncertainties which then impact on the systematic uncertainty on cross section measurement . for the energy dependence of @xmath14",
    ", the impact of these uncertainties as well as of the geometrical uncertainties can be minimized by studying the ratio @xmath15 of cross sections probed at different @xmath3 values .    assuming @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath17 experimentally , @xmath18 where @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the acceptance , luminosity and number of measured events , respectively , and therefore @xmath21 where the index 1(2 ) denotes measurements performed at @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . the acceptance for @xmath10 events at hera depends mainly on the detector infrastructure in the electron ( rear ) direction . if the change in the @xmath3 value results from changing the proton energy , the acceptance is likely to remain the same independent of @xmath3 and the ratio of acceptances will drop out in eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) .",
    "the number of measured events is from @xmath24 interactions . in order to convert the @xmath7 to @xmath10 cross section ,",
    "one uses the following relation : @xmath25 \\sigma^{\\gamma p}_{tot}(y)\\ , , \\label{gammapxsec}\\ ] ] where the term multiplying the @xmath10 cross section is known as the flux factor @xmath26 . in eq .",
    "( [ gammapxsec ] ) , @xmath27 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath28 is the energy fraction transferred by the positron to the photon in the proton rest system , @xmath29 ( here @xmath30 is the mass of the electron ) and the highest measured @xmath31 is @xmath32 ( @xmath33  0.01  gev@xmath9 ) .",
    "the flux @xmath26 is a function of @xmath28 and needs to be integrated over the measured @xmath28 range for obtaining the total @xmath10 cross section .    in the final days of hera running , a special photoproduction trigger was implemented for runs with proton energy set at the nominal value of 920 gev ( high - energy run , her ) and at proton energies lowered to 575 ( medium - energy run , mer ) and 460 gev ( low - energy run , ler ) . the analysis presented here attempts to extract the value of @xmath34 based on the combination of the her and ler data .",
    "the setup of the experiment is shown in fig .  [ fig : setup ] . at a distance of about 6 m from the interaction point in the zeus calorimeter , a spaghetti type calorimeter ,",
    "the so - called six meter tagger ( 6mt ) , was installed .",
    "the magnetic field of the hera magnet , in which the 6mt was located , bent the low - angle scattered positrons to the tagger , and thus the tagger was used for tagging photoproduction events .",
    "the luminosity was determined by measuring the rate of photons from the bethe - heitler ( bh ) process ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the latter was measured by two independent systems , the photon calorimeter ( pcal ) and the spectrometer ( spec ) .",
    "the two components ( pcal and spec ) enabled the measurement of the luminosity in two independent ways with 1% relative uncertainty .",
    "overall there was a 2.6% uncertainty common to both , due to the geometrical acceptance of the exit window .",
    "a dedicated trigger logic was designed to collect photoproduction events and keep the rates at acceptable levels .",
    "two conditions had to be fulfilled , a low - angle scattering positron candidate detected in the 6mt and some activity in the main detector .    for calculating the acceptance corrections in the main detector ,",
    "the pythia 6.221  @xcite generator was used .",
    "it was coupled to the heracles 4.6  @xcite program to simulate electromagnetic radiative effects .",
    "the acceptance of the 6mt is 100% for photoproduction events with positrons in the approximate energy range 3.5 - 6.8 gev , with a mean @xmath3 of 287 gev for her and 203 gev for ler .",
    "the data samples taken with the dedicated trigger configuration consisted of 4,164,552 events ( corresponding to a luminosity of 560.9 nb@xmath36 in the her and 12,798,828 events ( corresponding to a luminosity of 994.7 nb@xmath36 ) in the ler .",
    "these samples included background from different sources , like beam - gas events , bh overlays where the high energy photon hit the pcal and the positron hit the 6mt , and off - momentum ( with some transverse momentum ) beam positrons . after all cuts needed for suppressing background events , 62,653 events in the her and 113,362 events in the ler remained as genuine photoproduction events .    in order to calculate the ratio @xmath15 from eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) , the acceptances @xmath1 were calculated using the mc simulation .",
    "the acceptances of her and ler are equal within errors , corroborating our hypothesis that the ratio is independent of the acceptance and thus reduces the systematic error coming from the mc simulation .",
    "the systematic errors on the ratio came from the background suppression cuts ( 1.05% ) , from the uncertainty on the ratio of luminosities ( 1% ) and from the uncertainty on the ratio of fluxes ( 3.5% ) .",
    "this last high systematic uncertainty comes from the fact that the y range over which the flux has to be integrated is presently not precisely determined by the 6mt .",
    "this will improve with a better understanding and calibration of the 6mt .",
    "the value of @xmath34 as obtained from @xmath15 is @xmath37 which translates into @xmath38 this result is consistent with earlier determinations of @xmath13 , however has the advantage of being obtained from a single experiment and being model independent .    the statistical uncertainty will be improved in the future by including the data taken with a third proton beam energy ( mer ) .",
    "the systematic uncertainty will improve by a better understanding and calibration of the 6mt .",
