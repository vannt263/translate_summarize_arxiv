    "directed paths in random media ( dprm ) @xcite are simple realizations of glassy systems @xcite . some examples are pinned flux lines ( fl ) in high-@xmath1 superconductors , and domain walls in random field and random bond ising models . in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "a magnetic fl is pinned by defects ( oxygen impurities , grain boundaries , etc . ) in the superconductor which lower its energy @xcite .",
    "the resulting elastic distortions are limited by the line tension which opposes the bending of the line .",
    "this comptetition leads to a free energy landscape for the fl which is rather complicated and has many local minima , i.e. metastable states @xcite . when an electric current flows through the system , the fl feels a lorentz force perpendicular to its orientation and to the current direction .",
    "as long as the current is not strong enough to overcome the pinning forces , the line moves by thermally activated jumps of line segments between metastable configurations @xcite .",
    "the length of these line segments is estimated by the condition that the free energy barrier for a jump should be of the same order as the gain in free energy due to that jump .",
    "these dynamics are believed to be the reason for the nonlinear voltage - current characteristics found in experiments @xcite .    randomly placed impurities in ising ferromagnets",
    "may generate either a random magnetic field or random exchange couplings @xcite . the free energy landscape for domain walls in these systems",
    "is determined by the competition between the pinning energy and the energy cost ( per unit length or area ) for creating the wall . when the system is quenched to a low temperature",
    ", the magnetic domains grow . as for the flux line , the free energy gain due to the motion of a domain wall segment is expected to be of the same order as the free energy barrier which has to be overcome .",
    "since energy barriers play an important role in the dynamics of glassy systems , it is essential to know their properties .",
    "the scale of these barriers should grow with observation size @xmath2 like a power law @xmath3 .",
    "usually , it is assumed that the only energy scale in the system is set by the fluctuations in free energy which increase as @xmath4 , and that therefore @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , it is also quite possible that the heights of the ridges in the random energy landscape scale differently from those of the valleys that they separate , with @xmath6 .",
    "yet another scenario is that transport occurs mainly along a percolating channel of exceptionally low energy valleys with @xmath7 .",
    "a first attempt to clarify this situation was taken in ref.@xcite , where @xmath5 was established for a fl moving in 2 dimensions . using a combination of analytic arguments and numerical simulations , lower and upper bounds to the barrier",
    "were found .",
    "this argument was then extended to a fl in 3 dimensions @xcite , yielding again @xmath5 . in this article , we present in more detail the arguments discussed briefly in these earlier papers , including also systems with long - range correlated randomness ( random - field ising models ) in 2 dimensions .",
    "we obtain in all cases lower and upper bounds to the barrier that scale as @xmath4 , except for possible logarithmic factors , leading to @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it is argued that the result @xmath5 holds also in higher dimensions , as long as the distribution of minimal energies decays exponentially . in all cases , the line can move through the system by encountering energy fluctations of only order @xmath4 around the mean minimal energy .",
    "we also show that a line which initially has a larger energy can reach this region of minimal energies by crossing barriers of order @xmath4 ( or smaller ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ u2 ] , we determine the energy barrier for a fl moving in 2 dimensions . in section [ u3 ]",
    ", we apply the same algorithm to determine the energy barrier to the motion of domain walls in 2-dimensional random - field ising systems . in section [ u4 ] , we study energy barriers for a fl in 3 dimensions and discuss also the behavior in higher dimensions . in section [ u5 ] , we take a general look at the energy landscape and show that a line can move from any initial configuration to a minimal configuration by going over no barrier higher than @xmath4 . in section [ u6 ] , we try to put the definition of energy barriers on a more solid foundation , and section [ u7 ] argues that the results of the paper can be generalized to other elastic media with impurities .",
    "in two dimensions , we represent a dprm by the following model : the line is discretized to lie on the bonds of a square lattice , directed along its diagonal .",
    "each segment of the line can proceed along one of two directions , leading to a total of @xmath8 configurations after @xmath9 steps .",
    "these configurations are labelled by the set of integers @xmath10 for @xmath11 , giving the transverse coordinate of the line at each step ( clearly constrained such that @xmath12 ) . to each bond on the lattice",
    "is assigned a ( quenched ) random energy equally distributed between 0 and 1 .",
    "the energy of each configuration is the sum of all random bond energies on the line . without loss of generality",
    ", we set @xmath13 .    some exact results are known for this model @xcite : the fluctuations in the free energy at finite temperature scale as @xmath14 .",
    "the meanderings of the transverse coordinate of the line scale as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the roughness exponent .",
    "the scaling behavior of the pinned fl is governed by a zero - temperature fixed point @xcite where energy fluctuations scale in the same way .",
    "a fl at low temperatures , and in thermal equilibrium , is likely to spend most of the time in configurations of minimal energy . for each endpoint @xmath17 with @xmath18 ,",
    "there is a configuration of minimal energy @xmath19 which can be obtained numerically in a time of order @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that for @xmath21 , the function @xmath19 behaves as a random walk and is thus asymptotically gaussian distributed @xcite . since beyond the interval @xmath22 $ ] the energy of minimal paths is systematically larger , we consider in this paper only the region @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "fig.[minimalpaths1 ] shows minimal paths of length @xmath23 to endpoints between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "we want to find the energy barrier that has to be overcome when the line is moved from an initial minimal energy configuration @xmath26 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 to a final configuration @xmath29 between @xmath27 and @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "the only elementary move allowed is flipping a kink along the line from one side to the other ( except at the end point ) .",
    "thus the point @xmath32 can be shifted to @xmath33 .",
    "each route from the initial to the final configuration is obtained by a sequence of such elementary moves . for each sequence , there is an intermediate configuration of maximum energy , and a barrier which is the difference between this maximum and the initial energy . in a system at temperature @xmath34 ,",
    "the probability that the fl chooses a sequence which crosses a barrier of height @xmath35 is proportional to @xmath36 , multiplied by the number of such sequences .",
    "we assume that , as is the case for the equilibrium dprm , the `` entropic '' factor of the number of paths does not modify scaling behavior .",
    "thus at sufficiently low temperatures , the fl chooses the optimal sequence which has to overcome the least energy , and the overall barrier is the minimum of barrier energies of all sequences .",
    "since the number of elementary moves scales roughly as the area between the initial and final lines , the number of possible sequences grows as @xmath37 .",
    "this exponential growth makes it practically impossible to find the barrier by examining all possible sequences , hampering a systematic examination of barrier energies . rather than finding the true barrier energy ,",
    "we proceed by placing upper and lower bounds on it .",
    "the lower bound was given in ref.@xcite , and is obtained as follows : the endpoint of the path has to visit all sites @xmath17 with @xmath38 , and the energy of any path ending at @xmath17 is at least as large as @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the barrier energy can not be smaller than @xmath39 $ ] for @xmath40}$ ] .",
    "when @xmath41 is sufficiently small , the probability distribution of this lower bound is identical to that of the maximal deviation of a random walk of length @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the latter is a gaussian distribution with a mean value proportional to @xmath42 , and a variance scaling as @xmath41 .",
    "this growth saturates for @xmath41 of the order of @xmath43 , leading to the scaling behaviors , @xmath44 for the lower bound and its variance .",
    "the functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are proportional to @xmath47 and @xmath48 for small @xmath48 , respectively , and go to a constant for @xmath49 .",
    "our simulation results for systems with @xmath50 256 , 512 , 1024 , 2048 , and 4096 confirm this expectation .",
    "fig.[barriers1 ] shows the scaling functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 for different @xmath9 , and the collapse is quite satisfactory .",
    "however , the initial growth proportional to @xmath51 , is not clearly seen at these sizes .    to obtain an upper bound for the barrier , we specify an explicit algorithm for moving the line from its initial to final configuration .",
    "this is achieved by finding a sequence of intermediate steps .",
    "it is certainly advantageous to keep the intermediate paths as close to minimal configurations as possible .",
    "we therefore proceed in the following way : we first find the minimal paths connecting @xmath27 to the points @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and we add a last step to the left ( from @xmath52 to @xmath54 ) .",
    "if @xmath55 , we then move the point @xmath56 to @xmath57 . now",
    "the path has the same endpoint as the first intermediate minimal path .",
    "we then move the path to this first intermediate configuration ( the precise prescription will be given below ) , and then we move again the endpoint .",
    "this procedure is repeated , until the path reaches its final configuration . at each step , we obtain a local barrier path which separates two neighboring minimal configurations .",
    "the overall barrier is of course the one with the highest energy . while it may occasionally be possible to go to the next intermediate configuration in a single elementary move ( as defined above ) , this is generally not the case .",
    "intermediate minimal paths with the same endpoint may be quite far apart at coordinates @xmath58 .",
    "the reason is simple : suppose the random potential has a large positive fluctuation , a `` mountain . ''",
    "the minimal energy paths will then circumvent this region by going to its right or left .",
    "the last path going to the left and the first one going to the right have almost the same energy .",
    "they form a loop which can be quite large and is likely to enclose the barrier when both paths separate already at small @xmath59 .",
    "such loops have been conjectured @xcite to play an important role in the low - temperature dynamics of the dprm .",
    "since the transverse fluctuations of a minimal path of length @xmath9 grow as @xmath43 , we expect the lateral size of these loops to also be of this order .",
    "the algorithm for moving a line of length @xmath60 from an intermediate configuration @xmath61 to another one @xmath62 , with @xmath63 is as follows : if @xmath64 for all @xmath59 , we can choose a sequence of elementary moves such that at most two bonds of the line are not on one or the other minimal path , leading to a barrier of order 1 between the two . if @xmath65 for some @xmath59 , the two paths enclose a loop .",
    "we then consider the points @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "for each of these points , we find a minimal segment of length @xmath68 , connecting the point @xmath66 to @xmath27 by a minimal path , and we take a final step to the left from @xmath69 to @xmath70 . in the same way , we connect the points @xmath71 with @xmath72 to @xmath73 via minimal paths and add a first step to the right from @xmath70 to @xmath74 .",
    "two such segments form together an almost minimal path of length @xmath9 , constrained to go through intermediate points at @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we next move the line @xmath61 stepwise through this sequence of almost minimal paths .",
    "if @xmath77 , we first move the upper segment .",
    "if @xmath78 , we then move the lower segment .",
    "then we move the middlepoint .",
    "we continue by repeatedly moving the upper segment , the lower segment , and the middle point , until the final configuration @xmath62 is reached .",
    "( if the length of the line is different from @xmath79 , we might have to choose the upper segment to be larger by 1 than the lower segment , or vice versa . )",
    "the prescription for moving the segments of length @xmath75 is exactly the same as for paths of length @xmath9 : if the distance between two consecutive configurations is larger than 2 for some @xmath80 $ ] , we consider the points at @xmath81 in between the two , and find minimal paths of length @xmath82 connecting them to the initial and final points , and add a step to the middle points . next we attempt to move segments of length @xmath75 by repeatedly moving line portions of length @xmath83 . in some cases , when the energy barrier is large , it is necessary to proceed with this construction until the cutoff scale of @xmath84 is reached .",
    "thus , at each intermediate configuration , the line is composed of one segment of length @xmath85 , one of length @xmath86 , etc ; ending with two smallest pieces of length @xmath87 ( equal to 2 in the worst case ) .",
    "the barrier path is the intermediate configuration with highest energy .",
    "fig.[minimalpaths1 ] shows the barrier paths resulting from the above construction .",
    "we now estimate the barrier energy resulting from the above construction .",
    "each intermediate path is composed of segments of minimal paths with constrained endpoints , and we would like to find the probability distribution for the highest energy . constraining the endpoints of a minimal path of length @xmath59 typically increases its energy by @xmath88 .",
    "a subset of these intermediate paths ( those that cross the largest mountains ) have constraints imposed on segments of length @xmath9 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and all the way down to unity .",
    "the number of paths in this subset ( henceforth referred to as candidate barriers ) grows as @xmath89 , with @xmath90 .",
    "the lower limit comes from noting that for each loop of size @xmath91 there exist at least two loops of size @xmath92 , one in the upper and one in the lower half of the parent loop , thus @xmath93 .",
    "the upper limit comes from the total number of intermediate configurations that grows as @xmath94 .",
    "the energy of each candidate barrier path is obtained in a manner similar to that of the lower bound : instead of finding the maximum of a random walk of length @xmath95 , we now have to examine the sum of the maxima for a sequence of shorter and shorter random walks added together .",
    "the mean value of this sum is related to the convergent series , @xmath96 the correction term @xmath97 , is explained as follows : each segment of length @xmath91 is composed of a minimal path of length @xmath98 and one step which has a random energy ( the final or initial step , depending on whether the segment lies in the upper or lower half of a loop ) .",
    "so the energy of the segment is equal to the energy @xmath99 of a minimal path of length @xmath91 , plus a constant of order 1 . since",
    "a candidate barrier has @xmath100 segments , these constants add up to @xmath101 , with @xmath102 of the order of unity .",
    "the constant @xmath103 in eq.([meanec ] ) accounts for the breakdown of the scaling form of the energy increase for small loops .",
    "the mean angle of the smallest loops ( of size 2 ) approaches the @xmath104 limit ; their mean energy growing as @xmath105 .",
    "for the larger loops , the angle @xmath106 is small and the energy is @xmath107 . a finite value of @xmath108 acts as a cutoff separating the two limits .",
    "the energy difference per unit length between small and large paths then leads to the additive constant @xmath103 ( of the order of unity ) in eq.([meanec ] ) .",
    "the barrier energy is the maximum of the @xmath109 energies of all candidate barriers . to find its characteristics",
    ", we need the whole probability distribution for the energy @xmath110 .",
    "since @xmath111 is the sum of energies coming from its minimal segments , the simplest assumption is to regard the segment energies as independent , approximately gaussian , random variables .",
    "we then conclude that @xmath110 is also gaussian distributed with a variance , @xmath112 since the different segments are in fact constructed through a specific recursive procedure , their independence can not be justified . in the worst case that they are completely dependent",
    ", the right - hand side of eq.([varec ] ) has to be multiplied by @xmath113 .",
    "since our numerical results show no evidence for such a logarithmic factor , we shall not consider it any further .",
    "it can be checked easily that ( for large @xmath114 ) , the maximum of @xmath114 independent gaussian variables of mean @xmath115 and variance @xmath116 , is a gaussian of mean @xmath117 and variance @xmath118 @xcite . since the @xmath109 candidate barriers have large segments in common , their energies are not independent .",
    "we can approximately take this into account by assuming a subset of them as independent , leading to @xmath119 for some @xmath120 .",
    "we thus obtain the following estimates for the mean upper bound in barrier energy , @xmath121 and its variance , @xmath122 the functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 are proportional to @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , for small @xmath48 , constant at large @xmath48 , and in general different from those of the lower bound .",
    "our numerical simulations indeed confirm the above scaling forms .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath123 and @xmath124 are plotted in fig.[barriers1 ] for different values of @xmath9 , after averaging over 2000 realizations of randomness .",
    "the @xmath125 factors are essential , as a comparable collapse is not obtained without them .",
    "in fact , the best fit to @xmath126 is obtained by including the correction to scaling term @xmath127 , and with @xmath128 .",
    "the numerics therefore support the neglect of correlations , and the assumption of a gaussian distributed @xmath110 . as in the lower bound , the initial scaling proportional to @xmath129 is not clearly seen for the sizes studied . since the leading power for the scaling of the lower and upper bounds is identical , we conclude that the barrier energies also grow as @xmath14 .",
    "( it remains to be seen if the logarithmic factors are truly present , or merely an artifact of our algorithm . )",
    "in the previous section , we considered random bond energies which were uncorrelated .",
    "the analytic argument for the upper bound relied on the random - walk behavior of @xmath19 in this situation .",
    "thus , the proof for @xmath130 can not directly be extended to other situations , where the distribution of lower bound energies is not known .",
    "an important example is the case of domain walls in 2-dimensional random - field ising magnets .",
    "the energy for creating a domain wall is equal to the cost of flipping all spins on one side of the interface ; in turn proportional to the sum of all random fields on the flipped spins .",
    "there are consequently long - range correlations in the domain wall energy in the direction perpendicular to the orientation of the wall@xcite .",
    "we describe the configurations of the domain wall by essentially the same model as the fl , but assigning to each bond a random energy with long - range correlations in the @xmath131-direction .",
    "these correlations are generated by first selecting for each time @xmath9 , random numbers @xmath132 equally distributed between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , where @xmath114 is ( at least ) as large as the largest time occuring in the simulations .",
    "to each bond connecting @xmath17 to @xmath135 we then assign the energy @xmath136",
    "fig.[minimalpaths2 ] shows minimal paths of length @xmath137 . due to the correlations ,",
    "neighboring bonds have almost the same energy , and therefore minimal paths tend to have large parallel portions .",
    "fig.[walk ] shows the minimal energy as function of the endpoint position for a given realization of randomness , and for @xmath138 .",
    "this curve is much smoother and has longer correlations than the corresponding curve in the case of short - range correlated randomness , where the minimal energy performs a random walk .",
    "the fluctuations in free energy of a line are known to scale as @xmath9 , and the roughness exponent is @xmath139@xcite .",
    "we determined numerically the distribution function for the minimal energy shown in fig.[emin2 ] .",
    "it is very close to a gaussian , with no apparent power - law tails .",
    "we will show that , due to this property of the minimal energy distribution , the lower and upper bounds to the barrier scale in the same way as the fluctuations in minimal energy .",
    "as in the previous section , we move the line from an initial minimal energy configuration @xmath26 between @xmath27 and @xmath28 , to a final configuration @xmath29 between @xmath27 and @xmath140 .",
    "since the endpoint of the path has to visit all sites @xmath17 with @xmath38 , and since the energy of any path ending at @xmath17 is at least as large as @xmath19 , the barrier energy can not be smaller than @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "since the distribution of minimal energies decays exponentially and has no power - law tails , we can expect that the lower bound scales in the same way as the fluctuation of the minimal energy , leading to @xmath141 for the lower bound and its variance .",
    "our simulation results for systems with @xmath50 256 , 512 , 1024 and 2048 confirm this expectation .",
    "fig.[barriers2 ] shows the scaling functions @xmath142 and @xmath143 for different @xmath9 , and the collapse is quite satisfactory .",
    "however , the initial growth proportional to @xmath144 , is not clearly seen at these sizes .",
    "fig.[distrlower ] shows the distribution of lower bound energies .",
    "it is very close to a ( half)-gaussian of width proportional to @xmath145 .",
    "an upper bound can be obtained by exactly the same algorithm as before . the analytic argument made in the previous section ,",
    "however , can not be directly repeated , since the function @xmath19 is no longer a random walk in @xmath131 , and since we do not have analytic results for the lower bound .",
    "we can , however , combine analytic arguments with the numerical results for the lower bound to predict the scaling behavior of the upper bound .",
    "since the line is always composed of minimal segments , the energy of a candidate barrier which has segments of all lengths down to the cutoff is given by @xmath146 the origin of the terms @xmath147 has been explained in the previous section ( see paragraph after eq.([meanec ] ) ) .",
    "since the energy distribution of the lower bound is approximately ( half-)gaussian , the energy distribution of the candidate barriers decays also like a gaussian .",
    "the upper bound to the barrier energy is the maximum of the energies of all candidate barriers . in our simulations ,",
    "we find no evidence for logarithmic factors , indicating that the number of candidate barriers increases either very slowly , or not at all , with @xmath9 . from fig.[minimalpaths2 ] we can see that there is essentially one large loop over a distance of the order of the length of the path , leading to only few independent candidate barriers . as in the previous section , we find that the maximum of these candidate barriers , which is the upper bound to the barrier energy , scales in the same way as the lower bound , i.e. @xmath148 and its variance scales as @xmath149 fig.[barriers2 ] shows the scaling functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 .    to summarize the results so far , we have established the relation @xmath5 for lines in 2-dimensional systems with short- and long - range correlated randomness .",
    "since the considerations for both systems rely strongly on the dimensionality , it is of importance to look also at a 3-dimensional system , which is physically more relevant .",
    "in a two - dimensional system , the endpoint of the fl has to move through all points @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "this property was essential for the derivation of the lower bound in the previous sections .",
    "a fl which moves in three dimensions can avoid regions in space which are energetically unfavorable for some of its segments , and one may therefore speculate that @xmath7 . in this section ,",
    "we first determine numerically a lower bound for the barrier energy which scales in the same way as the energy fluctuations , thus ruling out @xmath7 .",
    "further numerical results predict that an upper bound scales in the same way , thus leading to @xmath5 .",
    "the line now lies on the bonds of a cubic lattice , starting at the origin and directed along its ( 1,1,1 ) diagonal .",
    "each segment of the line can proceed in the positive direction along one of the three axes , leading to a total of @xmath154 configurations after @xmath9 steps , with endpoints lying in the plane which is spanned by the points @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 .",
    "a given configuration of the fl is labelled by vectors @xmath158 for @xmath11 , giving the transverse coordinates of the fl at each step .",
    "the points @xmath159 lie on the vertices of a triangular lattice . for a given value of @xmath59 , they lie on one of three alternating sublattices .",
    "the minimal energy @xmath160 can be obtained numerically in a time of order @xmath161 .",
    "the fluctuations in minimal energy are known to scale as @xmath162 with @xmath163 , and the roughness exponent for minimal paths is @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the endpoints of the minimal paths with the lowest energy lie within a distance proportional to @xmath165 from the origin .",
    "figure [ profile ] shows the minimal energies of paths of length @xmath166 to endpoints @xmath167 with @xmath168 .",
    "the highest energy in this region is represented in white , the smallest energy in black .",
    "the minimal energies are correlated over a distance of the order of @xmath15 .",
    "the distribution of minimal energies is close to a gaussian and is shown in fig.[emin3 ] .",
    "similar to a 2-dimensional system @xcite ( see also fig.[emin2 ] ) , this distribution seems to have a third cumulant since it is not completely symmetric .    a lower bound to the barrier energy is obtained as follows : while the line moves from its initial to final configuration , the transverse coordinates of its endpoint move between nearest - neighbor positions on one of the above mentioned triangular sublattices .",
    "when the endpoint is at a position @xmath167 , the energy of the line is at least as large as the minimal energy @xmath160 . the maximum of all these minimal energies along the trajectory of the endpoint , minus the energy of the initial configuration , certainly bounds the barrier energy from below .",
    "since we do not know the actual trajectory of the endpoint , we have to look for the trajectory with the smallest maximal energy . only in this way",
    "can we be sure that we have indeed found a lower bound .",
    "this situation is fundamentally different from a 2-dimensional system , where there is only one possible trajectory for the endpoint .",
    "provided that the minimal energies @xmath160 are known , this lower bound is determined in polynomial time by using a transfer - matrix method : we start by assigning to the initial point @xmath169 a `` barrier energy '' @xmath170 , and to all other sites @xmath167 on the same sublattice a barrier energy @xmath171 , which is certainly larger than the lower bound resulting from the algorithm after many iterations . at each step , the energy @xmath103 of all sites @xmath167 , except for the initial site , is updated according to the following rule : look for the minimum of the energies @xmath172 of the 6 neighbors .",
    "if this is smaller than @xmath173 , replace @xmath173 by this minimum , or by @xmath174 , whichever is larger .",
    "after a sufficiently large number of iterations , which is of the order of the size of the area of interest ( scaling as @xmath175 ) , all possible trajectories to endpoints within this area have been probed , and the barrier energies @xmath173 do not change any more . the energy @xmath176 is then identified as the lower bound .",
    "figure [ lower ] shows the lower bound to the energy barrier for a line with the endpoint moving from the origin to sites within a distance of the order of @xmath15 , for different values of @xmath9 and averaged over 500 realizations of randomness .",
    "the distance @xmath177 has been scaled by @xmath178 , and the energy by @xmath179 .",
    "after this rescaling , all the curves collapse , leading to the following scaling behavior for the lower bound , @xmath180 the function @xmath181 should be proportional to @xmath182 for small @xmath48 .",
    "again , for the simulated system sizes , this asymptotic scaling is not clearly seen . for @xmath183 , the scaling form in eq.([eq1 ] )",
    "breaks down since the minimal energy is then a function of the angle @xmath184 .",
    "we conclude that the lower bound to the barrier scales in the same way as the fluctuations in minimal energy , and consequently the energy barrier increases at least as @xmath162 , leading to @xmath185 .",
    "the distribution @xmath186 of the lower bound energy for a fixed distance @xmath187 is shown in fig.[distribution ] .",
    "it appears to be half - gaussian with width proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the result @xmath188 is not surprising if we note that an even simpler lower bound is given by @xmath189 , which evidently scales as @xmath162 since the distribution function of minimal energies decays exponentially fast , i.e. has no power - law tails ( see fig.[emin3 ] ) . to make sure that the scaling of the lower bound found above",
    "is not dominated by the neighborhood of final configurations with particularly high energies , we repeated the above simulations by allowing only endpoints with minimal energies smaller than the initial energy .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where the endpoint of the line only moves to positions which are energetically more favorable .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[lower ] and again collapsed by the scaling form @xmath190 as in the previous case , the asymptotic scaling @xmath191 for small @xmath48 can not be clearly seen .",
    "the energy distribution of the lower bound is again a half - gaussian of width proportional to @xmath192 and looks similar to fig.[distribution ] .",
    "the same scaling behavior is also found when instead of the optimal trajectory for the endpoint , the shortest trajectory ( a straight line ) is chosen . in this case , the mean of the barrier energy @xmath193 has the scaling form @xmath194 ( see fig.[lower ] ) , again with a half - gaussian distribution of width proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "this , of course , does not represent a lower bound to the true barrier , but it will be important for the determination of an upper bound below , and is therefore included here .",
    "the result @xmath195 ( eq.([eq2 ] ) ) can be explained from the exponential tails of the distribution of minimal energies : if we asume that the endpoint of the line moves only in valleys of particularly low energy , we can successively remove all sites with the largest minimal energy from the set of possible endpoints , until the connectivity over the distance @xmath15 breaks down .",
    "the remaining endpoints form percolation clusters , and their density is given by the corresponding percolation threshold .",
    "( this is analogous to random resistor networks describing the hopping resistivity for strongly localized electrons .",
    "the resistance of the whole sample is governed by the critical resistor that makes the network percolate @xcite . ) since the occupied sites are correlated over the distances considered , the value for the threshold is different from the site percolation limit of 0.5 in an infinite triangular lattice with no correlation between occupied sites .",
    "but for the present purpose , it is sufficient to know that this threshold is finite , and that therefore a finite percentage of all sites are below threshold .",
    "since the distribution of minimal energies decays rapidly , its tail can not contain a finite percentage of all sites .",
    "we conclude that the threshold is within a distance of @xmath162 from the peak , and therefore that the energy fluctuation on the percolation cluster , and consequently the lower bound for the barrier , are proportional to @xmath162 .",
    "we now proceed to construct an upper bound to the energy barrier . to this purpose",
    ", we specify a sequence of elementary moves which take the line from its initial to final configuration .",
    "the only elementary move allowed is flipping a kink along the line .",
    "thus the point @xmath196 can be shifted to @xmath197 , where @xmath198 are the six vectors which connect a vertex in the triangular lattice to its nearest neighbors within the same sublattice .",
    "the algorithm is similar to the one in 2 dimensions : first , we choose a sequence of endpoints connecting the initial to the final endpoint which is as short as possible .",
    "then , we draw all the minimal paths leading to these endpoints , and attempt to move the line through them sequentially . if two consecutive minimal paths have nowhere a distance larger than 1 ( measured in units of @xmath199 ) , we can choose a sequence of elementary moves such that at most two bonds of the line are not on one or the other minimal path , leading to a barrier of order 1 between the two .",
    "if the distance is larger than 1 , we proceed essentially in the same way as in 2 dimensions , i.e. we consider the midway points @xmath200 which connect both lines via the shortest possible trajectory @xmath201 ( if there are several possibilities , we choose one at random ) . for each of these points ,",
    "we find two minimal segments of length @xmath85 connecting on one side to @xmath202 and on the other to either @xmath203 or @xmath204 .",
    "then we move the line by repeatedly moving segments of length @xmath85 , etc .",
    "the energy of a candidate barrier is then given by @xmath205 in principle , one should add correction terms similar to those in eqs.[meanec ] and [ meanec2 ] .",
    "however , these corrections are subleading with respect to @xmath162 and will be neglected .    as mentioned in section",
    "[ u3 ] , we can not rule out that the energies of minimal segments are independent from each other . in the worst case , where they are completely dependent , eq.([ec3d ] )",
    "has to be multiplied by @xmath206 .",
    "this may result in an additional factor proportional to @xmath207 in the upper bound , but does not otherwise affect any of our conclusions .",
    "the number of independent candidate barriers increases with some power in @xmath9 .",
    "since their energy distribution decays like a gaussian , we can take their maximum in the same way as before , and we finally obtain the following estimate for the upper bound , @xmath208    we have thus shown that the energy barrier encountered by a fl moving in a @xmath209 or @xmath210 random medium has an upper and a lower bound which both increase as @xmath162 , except for logarithmic factors .",
    "it thus follows that the barrier itself scales as @xmath162 , confirming the hypothesis @xmath5 .",
    "since the arguments are mainly based on the exponential tails of the minimal energy distributions , it is expected that the result @xmath5 holds also in higher dimensions .",
    "the only requirement is that the tails in the distributions of minimal energies still decay sufficiently rapidly .",
    "in the previous sections , we discussed energy barriers which have to be overcome by a line moving between minimal energy configurations .",
    "we showed that such lines can stay in an energy interval @xmath211 .",
    "however , a line may initially have an energy which is much larger .",
    "the initial configuration of a fl penetrating the system may be straight and parallel to the external magnetic field .",
    "if a system is cooled down from high temperatures , configurations of the fl are random walks of roughness exponent @xmath212 .",
    "an initial configuration with roughness exponent @xmath139 is found for fls driven close to a depinning transition@xcite .",
    "if the temperature is low ( as we always assume in this paper ) , the line then relaxes to some metastable state .",
    "the fl will ultimately reach a configuration of minimal energy , only if it is not separated from it by abnormally high barriers .",
    "we therefore show in this section that the line can reach the minimal energy region by going only over barriers which are not larger than order of @xmath162 .",
    "we specify an algorithm for moving a line of length @xmath60 _ from any initial configuration _ to one of minimal energy .",
    "the algorithm is similar to that presented in the previous sections , and leads to barriers of the order of @xmath162 .",
    "first , we assume that its initial roughness is not larger than that of minimal energy paths .",
    "let @xmath213 for @xmath214 be the initial configuration of the line , and @xmath215 a minimal energy configuration with @xmath216 and @xmath217 .",
    "we then define a sequence of paths @xmath218 , @xmath219 , which are constrained to go through the points @xmath220 for @xmath221 and are composed of @xmath91 minimal segments of length @xmath87 .",
    "the energy of such a segment is smaller than the energy of any other piece of a path with larger @xmath108 which has the same endpoints as the segment .",
    "we now move the line successively through this sequence of configurations , going from the largest to the smallest value of @xmath108 . the configurations @xmath222 and @xmath223 intersect each other at the points @xmath224 , with @xmath225 .",
    "we therefore can move the line from the configuration @xmath222 to @xmath223 by successively moving segments of length @xmath226 . in many cases ,",
    "the segments have to overcome a loop , and then we apply the algorithm defined previously .",
    "in contrast to the previous sections , these loops do not separate two minimal configurations , but one minimal segment , and another constrained at its midpoint , a constellation which occured also in the previous sections as an intermediate situation .",
    "since we restricted the roughness of the initial configuration to less than that of minimal paths , the size of the loops does not exceed @xmath15 .",
    "the number of independent candidate barriers within a loop is therefore smaller than , or equal to , @xmath227 from previous arguments , where the exponent @xmath228 depends on the model .",
    "the energy of each candidate path is smaller than , or equal to , the energy @xmath229 , which was also obtained in the previous sections .",
    "the total number of loops is less than or equal to @xmath230 , and the energy of each candidate barrier is certainly overestimated if we assume that all loops are of size @xmath9 .",
    "we therefore find an upper bound to the barrier which is the maximum of @xmath231 candidates chosen from a distribution @xmath232 with @xmath233 , and with a gaussian tail . as we saw in section [ u3 ] , such a maximum scales as @xmath234 .",
    "we therefore have shown that a line can move from any configuration with roughness exponent less than @xmath235 to a minimal energy configuration by crossing barriers which are not larger than order of @xmath236 , provided that the barriers between minimal configurations scale also as @xmath162 .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for any initial configuration of the line . to demonstrate this ,",
    "let us look at the configuration @xmath237 , which is as far as possible from a minimal configuration .",
    "we then define a sequence of paths @xmath218 , for @xmath238 , with @xmath239 for @xmath240 , and connecting the points @xmath241 and @xmath242 by a minimal path . to go from one configuration to the next one",
    ", the line has to overcome a loop of size no bigger than @xmath243 .",
    "there are consequently proportional to @xmath244 candidates for barrier paths of length between 2 and @xmath9 .",
    "we certainly find an upper bound to the barrier by assuming that all these candidates have the length @xmath9 , and that their energies are taken from a ( half- ) gaussian distribution of width proportional to @xmath236 .",
    "the upper bound consequently scales as @xmath234 .",
    "so far , we tacitly assumed that the activation barrier is given by the difference of the highest energy encountered by the line and its initial energy , just as in thermally activated chemical reactions .",
    "this assumption , however , has no solid foundation , since the line does not simply move over an isolated maximum , but through a random energy landscape .",
    "in addition , it is not at all clear how results obtained for a point - like particle in a 1-dimensional energy landscape can be generalized to lines moving in 2- or 3-dimensional systems . to shed some light at least on the first of these points",
    ", we study in this section a particle in a 1-dimensional energy landscape at low temperatures .",
    "we tilt this landscape by a small angle to take into account the effect of an external driving force . using the fokker - planck equation",
    ", we calculate the stationary particle current through this tilted energy landscape .",
    "we find that it is not the difference between the maximal and initial energies , but the difference between the maximal and the minimal energies , which determines the activation barrier .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for the probability density @xmath245 of an overdamped particle in one dimension is @xmath246 here , @xmath247 is the inverse of the product of the particle mass and the friction coefficient .",
    "the potential @xmath248 is the sum of the random potential @xmath249 and a driving term @xmath250 , where @xmath251 is the constant driving force . depending on the boundary conditions , this equation has different stationary solutions @xmath252 .",
    "if the boundary is an infinitely high wall at both ends of the system , we obtain the equilibrium solution @xmath253 , and zero current @xmath254 we instead look for a solution where particles enter the system at one end and leave it at the other end .",
    "this solution is most readily found by assuming periodic boundary conditions , @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "this situation corresponds to a periodic energy landscape which has been tilted , and where each section of length @xmath2 contains the same number of particles .",
    "clearly , this leads to a stationary flow through the system , with particles entering a section at one end and leaving it at the other . in the limit of small driving force @xmath251 ,",
    "the stationary current is found by considering only terms up to linear order in @xmath251 ( order zero gives the equilibrium solution of the untilted system ) , and is given by@xcite @xmath257 . \\label{maxmin}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath258 , the integrals are dominated by the neighborhoods of the maximum and the minimum of the potential , leading to @xmath259 $ ] .",
    "this means that the particle mobility is determined by the difference between the energy maximum and minimum .",
    "this result is plausible since the particles explore all of the energy landscape and therefore also go down to the valleys and have to come up all the way again@xcite .    generalizing the above arguments to a line in 2 dimensions",
    "is difficult , and we did not succeed in solving the corresponding fokker - planck equation analytically . evidently , the line can avoid configurations with particularly high energy , which seems to justify the assumption that the barrier is the lowest possible which separates the initial and the final configurations . in the light of eq.([maxmin ] ) , however , we may need to define the barrier energy as the difference between the maximum and the minimum , instead of the difference between the maximum and the initial energy .",
    "if so , we should add to the barrier the difference between the initial energy and that of the absolute minimum along the trajectory of the line . we know , however , that the distribution of minimal energies has only exponental tails , and that therefore both types of barriers scale in the same way",
    ". consequently , our results do not depend on the precise definition of the barrier . to confirm this , we plot in fig.[upper ] the scaling functions @xmath260 and @xmath261 for the barrier to 2-dimensional lines with either short - range or long - range correlated randomness , determining the difference between the maximal and minimal energy of all intermediate configurations of the line .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the barrier energy still satisfies eqs.([meane+1 ] ) and ( [ meane+2 ] ) .",
    "in this paper we considered various properties of the energy landscape of one of the simplest realizations of glassy systems .",
    "we showed that , under fairly general conditions , the energy barriers encountered by a line descending into the region of minimal energies , or moving within this region , scale in the same way as the fluctuations in minimal energy .",
    "this means , in particular , that there exist no metastable configurations which can not be left by going over energy barriers smaller than , or equal to , the fluctuations in minimal energy .",
    "similar arguments are applicable to interfaces in random media , like domain walls in 3-dimensional random bond and random field ising models .",
    "when the interface moves from an initial to a final configuration , with part of its boundary fixed , a given boundary point moves along a line .",
    "for each position of this boundary point , there exists a configuration of minimal energy .",
    "the maximum of these minimal energies certainly is a lower bound to the barrier .",
    "if the distribution of minimal energies has no power - law tails , this lower bound scales in the same way as the minimal energy fluctuations .",
    "an upper bound can be constructed using a similar algorithm as for the line : each time the interface ( or a segment of it ) has to overcome a loop , we bisect it and repeatedly move the upper and lower segment through a sequence of minimal configurations . in this way",
    ", the interface is always composed of minimal segments , and it should scale in the same way as the lower bound ( except for logarithmic factors , and provided that the lower bound energy distribution has no power - law tails ) .    given these results for lines and interfaces , it is likely that they generally hold for elastic media with impurities , e.g. for a bunch of flux lines .",
    "the latter situation is certainly of much more physical releance than a single fl .",
    "our results for a single fl , may thus have provided a glimpse into the complexity of the energy landscape of more complicated glassy systems .    based on results for particles in 1-dimensional energy landscapes",
    ", we also argue that the energy barrier should not be defined with respect to the initial energy , but to the minimal energy along the trajectory of the line .",
    "it stills remains a challenge to generalize this argument to lines in 2- or higher dimensional energy landscapes , and to find a more precise expression for the response of the line to a driving force , starting from the fokker - planck equation .",
