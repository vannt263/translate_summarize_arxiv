    "controlling chaotic transport is a key challenge in many branches of physics like for instance , in particle accelerators , free electron lasers or in magnetically confined fusion plasmas .",
    "one way to control transport would be that of reducing or suppressing chaos . there exist numerous attempts to control chaos ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a rather extended list of references ) .",
    "most of the methods for controlling chaotic systems is done by tilting targeted trajectories . however , for many body experiments like the magnetic confinement of a plasma or the control of turbulent flows , such methods are hopeless due to the high number of trajectories to deal with simultaneously . for these systems , it is desirable to control transport properties without significantly altering the original system under investigation nor its overall chaotic structure .",
    "here we focus on another strategy which is based on building barriers by adding a small apt perturbation which is localised in phase space , hence confining all the trajectories .",
    "the main motivations for a _ localised control _ are the following ones  : very often the control of a physical system can only be performed in some specific regions of phase space .",
    "this is in particular the case in thermonuclear fusion devices where the electric potential can only be modified near the border of the plasma .",
    "for some purposes it is sometimes desirable to stabilize only a given region of phase space without modifying the major part of phase space in order to preserve some specific features of the system .",
    "this method can be used to bound the motion of particles without changing the perturbation inside ( and outside ) the barrier .",
    "also , using a localised control means that one needs to inject much fewer energy than a global control in order to create isolated barriers of transport .    in this article",
    ", we consider the class of hamiltonian systems that can be written in the form @xmath0",
    "i.e.  an integrable hamiltonian @xmath1 ( with action - angle variables ) plus a small perturbation @xmath2 . the idea is to _ slightly _ and _ locally _ modify the perturbation and create regular structures ( like invariant tori )  : the aim is to devise a control term @xmath3 such that the dynamics of the controlled hamiltonian @xmath4 has more regular trajectories or less diffusion than the uncontrolled one . for practical purposes ,",
    "the control term should be small with respect to the perturbation @xmath2 , and localised in phase space ( i.e.  the subset of phase space where @xmath3 is non - zero is finite and small ) .    in refs .",

    "the main drawback of this approach is that the control term has to be applied on all the phase space .",
    "here we provide a method to construct control terms @xmath3 of order @xmath5 with a finite support in phase space , such that the controlled hamiltonian @xmath7 has isolated invariant tori .",
    "for hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom , these invariant tori act as barriers in phase space . for higher dimensional systems",
    "kam tori act as effective barriers of diffusion .",
    "the main result of the paper is stated as follows  : for a hamiltonian system written in action - angle variables with @xmath8 degrees of freedom , the perturbed hamiltonian is @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a non - resonant vector of @xmath12 .",

    "hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : gene ] ) has an invariant torus with frequency vector close to @xmath21 . after proving this result",
