    "a classical @xmath0symbol is a real number which can be associated to a labelling of the six edges of a tetrahedron by irreducible representations of @xmath1 , in other words by natural numbers .",
    "its definition is roughly as follows .",
    "let @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) denote the @xmath4dimensional irreducible representation .",
    "the @xmath1invariant part of the triple tensor product @xmath5 is non - zero if and only if @xmath6 in which case we may pick , almost canonically , a basis vector @xmath7 ( details are given below ) .",
    "suppose we have a tetrahedron , labelled so that the three labels around each face satisfy these conditions : we will call this an _ admissible _ labelling .",
    "then we may associate to each face an @xmath8tensor , and contract these four tensors together to obtain a scalar , the @xmath0symbol , denoted by a picture or a bracket symbol as in figure [ figtet ] .",
    "@xmath9    this tetrahedral picture is traditionally used simply to express the _ symmetry _ of the @xmath0symbol , which is naturally invariant under the full tetrahedral group @xmath10 . however , it has a deeper _ geometric _ significance .",
    "to an admissibly - labelled tetrahedron we may associate a metric tetrahedron @xmath11 whose side lengths are the six numbers @xmath12 .",
    "its individual faces may be realised in euclidean @xmath13space , by the admissibility condition . as a whole",
    ", @xmath11 is either _ euclidean _ ,",
    "_ minkowskian _ or _ flat _ ( in other words has either a non - degenerate isometric embedding in euclidean or minkowskian @xmath14space , or has an isometric embedding in euclidean @xmath13space ) , according to the sign of a certain polynomial in its edge - lengths .",
    "if @xmath11 is euclidean , let @xmath15 be its corresponding exterior dihedral angles and @xmath16 be its volume .",
    "[ t : main ] suppose a tetrahedron is admissibly labelled by the numbers @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be a natural number .",
    "as @xmath19 , there is an asymptotic formula @xmath20 ( where the sum is over the six edges of the tetrahedron ) .",
    "a ( slightly different ) version of this formula was conjectured in 1968 by the physicists ponzano and regge , building on heuristic work of wigner ; they produced much evidence to support it but did not prove it .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to prove the above theorem using geometric quantization , and to explain the relation between @xmath1 representation theory and the geometry of @xmath21 .",
    "the formula has a lovely and peculiar consequence in elementary geometry .",
    "it is well - known that a generic tetrahedron is not _ congruent _",
    "( by an orientation - preserving isometry of @xmath21 ) to its mirror - image , but is _ scissors - congruent _ to it ( in other words , the two tetrahedra are finitely equidecomposable ) . inspired by the additional algebraic _ regge symmetry _ of @xmath0symbols and the asymptotic formula above , one may derive from a generic tetrahedron a family of _ twelve _ non - congruent but scissors - congruent tetrahedra !",
    "section 2 contains the algebraic and section 3 the differential - geometric preliminaries .",
    "section 4 is a warm - up example , computing asymptotic rotation matrix elements for @xmath1 representations .",
    "it works in the same way as the eventual computation ( in section 5 ) for the @xmath0symbol , but is much simpler and displays the method more clearly .",
    "section 6 contains the geometric corollaries mentioned above and further notes on the ponzano  regge paper .    throughout the paper , the symbol `` @xmath22 '' denotes an asymptotic formula , whereas `` @xmath23''denotes merely an approximation .    after having the basic ideas for this paper",
    ", i spent some time collaborating with john barrett , trying to find a good method of doing the actual calculations required .",
    "neither of us had much success during this period , and the details presented here were worked out by me later .",
    "( i feel quite embarrassed at ending up the sole author in this way . )",
    "i am especially grateful to john for many lengthy , interesting and helpful discussions on the subject , and also to jrgen andersen , johan dupont , james flude , elmer rees , mike singer and vladimir turaev for other valuable discussions .",
    "the simplest definition is via penrose s spin network calculus , which is related to kauffman bracket skein theory at @xmath24 .",
    "the details are in the book of kauffman and lins @xcite .",
    "there is a topological invariant @xmath25 of planar links ( systems of generically immersed curves ) defined by sending a link @xmath26 to @xmath27 it extends to an invariant of suitably - labelled trivalent graphs in @xmath28 , for example the mercedes ( tetrahedron ) and theta symbols shown in figure [ fskein ] .",
    "@xmath29    to define it , we replace each edge by a number of parallel strands equal to its label , and connect them up without crossings at the vertices ( this imposes precisely the conditions on the the three incident labels ) .",
    "then we replace this diagram by the set of all planar links obtained by inserting a permutation of the strands near the middle of each edge .",
    "finally , evaluate each of these using , add up their contributions , and divide by the number of such diagrams ( the product of the factorials of the edge - labels ) .",
    "explicit evaluations of these quantities are given in @xcite .",
    "[ combdef ] the @xmath0symbol shown in figure [ figtet ] is defined as the spin - network evaluation of the above admissibly - labelled mercedes symbol , divided by the product of the square - roots of the absolute values of the four theta symbols associated with its vertices .",
    "it is manifestly @xmath10invariant .",
    "it is important to note that the spin - network picture is _ dual _ to the one drawn in figure [ figtet ] .",
    "there , the trilinear invariant spaces are associated with _",
    "faces _ of the tetrahedron , whereas in the mercedes symbol they are associated with _",
    "vertices_.    although this definition is the simplest , we will need a more algebraic version where the @xmath0symbol is exhibited as a hermitian pairing of two vectors .",
    "let @xmath30 be the fundamental @xmath13dimensional representation of @xmath1 , which we will consider as the space of linear homogeneous polynomials in coordinate functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then the other irreducibles , the symmetric powers @xmath33 , @xmath34 , are the spaces of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath35 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath2 is @xmath36 ; when @xmath35 is even , it is an irreducible representation of @xmath37 .",
    "making @xmath31 , @xmath32 orthonormal determines an invariant hermitian inner product @xmath38 on @xmath30 , and induces inner products on the higher representations @xmath2 , thought of as subspaces of the tensor powers of @xmath30 .",
    "the fundamental representation has an invariant skew tensor @xmath39 , which induces quaternionic or real structures on the @xmath2 , according as @xmath35 is odd or even .",
    "the @xmath1invariant part of the tensor product of two irreducibles @xmath40 is zero unless @xmath41 , when it is one - dimensional .",
    "similarly , the invariant part of the triple tensor product @xmath42 of irreducibles is either empty or one - dimensional , according to the famous conditions .",
    "( the meaning of the parity condition is clear from the fact that the centre of @xmath1 is the cyclic group @xmath43 .",
    "the other conditions , often written more compactly as @xmath44 , are more surprising .",
    "why the existence of a euclidean triangle with the prescribed sides should have anything to do with this will be explained shortly . )",
    "we want to pick well - defined basis vectors @xmath45 and @xmath7 for these spaces of bilinear and trilinear invariants .",
    "since each such space has a hermitian form and a real structure , we could just pick real unit vectors , but this would still leave a sign ambiguity . to fix this",
    "we may as well just write down the invariants concerned . consider the vectors corresponding to the polynomials @xmath46 on @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the required vectors are obtained from these by rescaling using positive real numbers , to obtain @xmath45 with norm @xmath52 and @xmath7 with norm @xmath53 .",
    "[ 6jdef ] given six irreducibles @xmath54 , one can form @xmath55 ( supposing these all exist ) inside a 12fold tensor product of irreducibles .",
    "one may always form @xmath56 , and permute the factors ( without reversing the order of the paired factors ) to match .",
    "then the hermitian pairing of these two vectors ( inside the 12fold tensor product ) defines the associated @xmath0symbol by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is simply the sum of the six labels .",
    "one should think of it as a function of six natural numbers @xmath59 , defined whenever the triples @xmath60 satisfy the triangle and parity conditions , in other words when the associated tetrahedron labelling is admissible .",
    "it is standard to extend the definition to all such sextuples by setting the @xmath0symbol to zero elsewhere .",
    "these two definitions agree .",
    "the mercedes spin network evaluation used in definition [ combdef ] can be reinterpreted as an explicit tensor contraction , using penrose s diagrammatic tensor calculus ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the invariant @xmath61 of a planar link may be evaluated by making the link morse with respect to the vertical axis in @xmath62 , replacing cups and caps with @xmath63 times the standard skew tensor ( @xmath64 and its dual , crossings with the flip tensor , and composing these morphisms to obtain a scalar .",
    "if we draw the mercedes graph as in figure [ messy ] and use this recipe to compute it , we see that it is given as the composition of a vector in @xmath65 ( coming from the cups in the lower half of the diagram ) , a tensor product of twelve young symmetrisers ( coming from the flips associated to the crossings which are introduced where the labels are ) and a vector in the dual of @xmath66 ( coming from the caps ) .",
    "@xmath67    this can be interpreted as a bilinear pairing between a vector in the tensor product of twelve irreps and one in its dual , if we use the symmetrisers to project to these . reinterpreting it as a hermitian pairing and including the normalisation factors gives the purely algebraic formulation of definition [ 6jdef ] .",
    "this definition does not depend on the choice of hermitian form , coordinates , or real structure .",
    "it does depend on the sign conventions , but these can be seen to be sensible ( in that the resulting @xmath0symbol is @xmath10invariant ) using the lemma .    a third way of defining the @xmath0symbols is to build a basis for @xmath68 out of the trilinear invariants using an isomorphism such as @xmath69 where @xmath70 runs through all values such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 satisfy .",
    "there are three standard ways of doing this , corresponding to the three pairings of the four `` things '' @xmath73 , and the change - of - basis matrix elements are ( after mild renormalisation ) the @xmath0symbols .",
    "using this definition makes the elliott ",
    "biedenharn identity ( pentagon identity ) for @xmath0symbols very clear , but disguises their tetrahedral symmetry ; therefore we will not consider this method here .",
    "see varshalovich et al @xcite for this approach .",
    "their definition coincides with the two given here , and with the one in ponzano and regge ( though in these physics - oriented papers , half - integer spins are used ) .",
    "the representation theory of @xmath1 is well - known to physicists as the theory of quantized angular momentum .",
    "the fundamental @xmath13dimensional complex representation @xmath30 can be viewed as the space of states of spin of a spin@xmath74 particle .",
    "the other irreducibles , the symmetric powers @xmath75 , are state spaces for particles of higher spin ; indeed , physicists label them by their associated spins @xmath76 .",
    "quantum and classical state - spaces are very different : the classical state of a spinning particle is described by an angular momentum vector in @xmath21 , whereas in the quantum theory , one should imagine the state vectors as wave - functions on @xmath21 , whose pointwise norms give _ probability distributions _ for the value of the angular momentum vector",
    ". however , when the spin is very large , the quantum and classical behaviour should begin to correspond .",
    "for example , the wave - functions representing states of a particle with large spin @xmath77 should be concentrated near the sphere of radius @xmath77 in @xmath21 .",
    "many representation - theoretic quantities , most obviously square - norms of matrix elements of representations , can be interpreted as probability amplitudes for quantum - mechanical observations .",
    "wigner @xcite explained the @xmath0symbol as follows .",
    "suppose one has a system of four particles with spins @xmath78 and total spin @xmath79 .",
    "then the _ square _ of the @xmath0symbol is essentially the probability , given that the first two particles have total spin @xmath80 , that the first and third combined have total spin @xmath81 .",
    "( compare with the third definition in the remark in subsection [ 4def ] . )",
    "he reasoned that for large spins , because of the concentration of the wave - functions , one can treat this statement as dealing with addition of vectors in @xmath21 .",
    "suppose one has four vectors of lengths @xmath82 which form a closed quadrilateral .",
    "then , given that one diagonal is @xmath80 , what is the probability that the other is @xmath81 ?",
    "his analysis yielded the formula : @xmath83 where @xmath16 is the volume of the euclidean tetrahedron whose edge - lengths are @xmath84 , supposing it exists .",
    "he emphasised that this is a dishonest approximation : the @xmath0symbols are wildly oscillatory functions of the dimensions , and his formula is only a local average over these oscillations , true in the same sense that one might write : @xmath85    ponzano and regge improved his formula to one very similar to , deducing the oscillating phase term from clever empirical analyses , and verified that as an approximation it is extremely accurate , even for small irreps .",
    "to rigorize wigner s arguments , we need a concrete geometric realisation of the representations @xmath2 .",
    "this is provided by the borel  weil ",
    "bott theorem ( see for example segal @xcite or @xcite ) : all finite - dimensional irreducible representations of semisimple lie groups are realised as spaces of holomorphic sections of line bundles on compact complex manifolds , on which the groups act equivariantly .",
    "we only need the simplest case of this , namely that the irrep @xmath2 of @xmath1 is the space of holomorphic sections of the @xmath35th tensor power of the hyperplane bundle @xmath86 on the riemann sphere @xmath87 .",
    "if one thinks of these as functions on the dual tautological bundle , which is really just @xmath88 blown up at the origin , they can be identified with spaces of homogeneous polynomial functions on @xmath88 ( ie in two variables ) with the obvious @xmath1 action ( or possibly the dual of the obvious one , depending on quite how carefully you considered what `` obvious '' meant ! )    tensor products of such irreps are naturally spaces of holomorphic sections of the external tensor product of these line bundles over a product of riemann spheres , for example @xmath89 with the diagonal action of @xmath1 on spheres and bundles .",
    "the calculation we are going to perform is a stationary phase integration , for which we need local differential - geometric information about these holomorphic sections .",
    "we will take the primarily symplectic point of view of guillemin and sternberg @xcite , as well as using the main theorem of their paper ( see below ) .",
    "other relevant references are mcduff and salamon @xcite for general symplectic background and for symplectic reduction , kirillov @xcite for a concise explanation of geometric quantisation , and mumford et al @xcite for the wider context of geometric invariant theory .",
    "suppose @xmath90 is a compact khler manifold of dimension @xmath91 .",
    "thus , it has a complex structure @xmath92 acting on the real tangent spaces @xmath93 , a symplectic form @xmath94 and a riemannian metric @xmath95 ( we avoid the symbol @xmath96 , which will denote a group element ) .",
    "the latter are @xmath92invariant and compatible with each other according to the equation @xmath97 this being a positive - definite inner product . the liouville volume form",
    "@xmath98 equals the riemannian volume form .",
    "the hermitian metric on @xmath93 ( thought of as a complex space ) is @xmath99 which is linear in the first factor and antilinear in the second ( the convention used throughout the paper ) .",
    "let @xmath100 be a compact group acting symplectically on @xmath90 .",
    "we assume that the action is also hamiltonian ( ie that a moment map exists ) and that it preserves the khler structure .",
    "this will certainly be true in the examples we will deal with .",
    "we let @xmath101 be the lie algebra of @xmath100 .",
    "then an element @xmath102 defines a hamiltonian vector field @xmath103 , a hamiltonian @xmath104 and thus a moment map @xmath105 according to the conventions @xmath106 i will later abuse notation slightly and write @xmath107 instead of @xmath104 when i want to emphasise the association of the moment map with a vector field corresponding to an infinitesimal action of @xmath100 , rather than with an explicit lie algebra element .",
    "if the symplectic form @xmath94 represents an integral cohomology class then there is a unique ( we will assume @xmath90 is simply - connected ) hermitian holomorphic line bundle over @xmath90 , with metric @xmath108 , whose associated compatible connection has curvature form @xmath109 ( so that @xmath110 $ ] is its first chern class ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath100 acts equivariantly on @xmath86 , preserving its hermitian form .",
    "the space of holomorphic sections @xmath111 is finite - dimensional and has a natural left @xmath100action defined by @xmath112 @xmath16 becomes a unitary representation of @xmath100 when given the inner product @xmath113 the round bracket notation will be used to distinguish the _ global _ or _ algebraic _ hermitian forms from the _ pointwise _ form on the line bundle @xmath86 , which will be written with angle brackets .",
    "the infinitesimal action on sections is given by the formula @xmath114 this is the fundamental `` quantization formula '' of kostant et al .",
    "one has to be very careful with signs here , especially as there is such variation of convention in the literature .",
    "this formula is _ minus _ the lie derivative @xmath115 , because we are interested in the _ left _ action of @xmath100 , and the lie derivative is defined using the contravariant ( right ) action of @xmath100 on sections via pullback .",
    "there is an identical problem if one looks at the derivative of the left action of @xmath100 on vector fields , one has : @xmath116\\ ] ] provided one uses the standard conventions on lie derivative and bracket : @xmath117 = { \\mathcal l}_xy , \\qquad [ x , y]f = x(yf)-y(xf)\\ ] ] for further comments on sign conventions see mcduff  salamon @xcite , remark 3.3 , though note that we do not here adopt their different lie bracket convention .",
    "anyway , it is a good exercise to check that the formula really does define a lie algebra homomorphism : for this one also needs the standard conventions on curvature : @xmath118 - \\nabla_{[x , y]}\\ ] ] and on poisson bracket : @xmath119      in the borel ",
    "bott setup , one actually has a complex group @xmath120 acting on @xmath86 and @xmath90 .",
    "( of course it does not preserve the hermitian structure on @xmath86 , but its maximal compact part @xmath100 does . ) the action of @xmath121 on sections of @xmath86 is given by @xmath122 the last identity coming because @xmath123 is a holomorphic section , so is covariantly constant in the antiholomorphic directions in @xmath124 : @xmath125 the point of this identity is that it gives us information about the derivatives of an invariant section in directions orthogonal to the slice @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath127dimensional irrep of @xmath1 is obtained by quantising @xmath28 with a round metric and with an equivariant hermitian line bundle @xmath128 of curvature @xmath129 , where @xmath94 is the standard form with area 1 .",
    "we will always view @xmath28 as being the unit sphere in @xmath21 .",
    "in cylindrical coordinates , its unit area form is then ( `` archimedes theorem '' ) @xmath130 let @xmath131 be an element in the lie algebra of the circle so that @xmath132 .",
    "the moment map for the @xmath53periodic rotation about the @xmath133axis , generated by the vector field @xmath134 is @xmath135 given by @xmath136 .",

    "let @xmath140 denote the slice @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath100equivariance of the moment map @xmath105 ( coadjoint action on the right ) means that @xmath140 is @xmath100invariant , and consequently that @xmath141 for any @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",

    "their claim , in our integer - labelling notation , is that for large @xmath17 : @xmath659 where @xmath397 is a tetrahedron whose edges are @xmath660 and whose dihedral angles @xmath661 and volume @xmath662 are therefore slightly different from those of our @xmath11 .",
    "this difference is worrying , as it is quite possible to find sextuples of integers such that @xmath397 is euclidean yet @xmath11 is minkowskian , in which case the formulae seem to conflict : is the @xmath0symbol exponentially or polynomially decaying in this case ?    the second difference explains this .",
    "the ponzano ",
    "regge formula is only claimed as an _ approximation _ for large irreducibles , rather than an asymptotic expansion in a strict sense as in theorem [ t : main ] .",
    "therefore the only meaningful comparison between the two formulae is to examine how their function behaves as we rescale @xmath17 by @xmath19 in the precise sense of our theorem .",
    "although for small @xmath18 it is possible that @xmath397 might be euclidean when @xmath11 is not , eventually the shift in edge - lengths becomes insignificant and either both are euclidean or neither is .",
    "therefore there is no inconsistency between cases in the two formulations .    as for comparing the actual formulae , the asymptotic behaviour of the ponzano ",
    "regge function is @xmath663 because @xmath16 and @xmath662 agree to leading order in @xmath18 .",
    "the only problem is the dihedral angles relating to slightly different tetrahedra .",
    "fortunately we may easily show that @xmath664 by applying the _ schlfli identity _",
    "( see milnor @xcite ) , which says that the differential form @xmath665 vanishes identically on the space of euclidean tetrahedra .",
    "therefore there is no inconsistency .",
    "suppose one picks out a pair of opposite sides of the tetrahedron denoting the @xmath0symbol ( as in figure [ figtet ] ) , say @xmath666 .",
    "let @xmath123 be half the sum of the other four labels ( twice their average ) .",
    "define : @xmath667 regge discovered that the @xmath0symbols are invariant under this algebraic operation ( the easiest way to see this is to look at the generating function for @xmath0symbols , @xcite ) : @xmath668 we can also consider this as a _ geometric _ operation on a tetrahedron , altering its side lengths according to the above scheme .",
    "it is not meant to be obvious that the result of applying this to a euclidean tetrahedron will return a euclidean one !",
    "regge and ponzano considered the effect of this symmetry on the geometrical quantities occurring in their asymptotic formula , mainly as another check on its plausibility .",
    "they discovered that the volume and phase term associated to a euclidean tetrahedron are indeed exactly invariant .",
    "this is amazing , given that it would be consistent with their appearance in an _",
    "asymptotic _ expansion for them to change , but by lower - order contributions .",
    "let us reconsider this surprising geometric symmetry .",
    "first note that the symmetry is an involution : if one thinks geometrically , it corresponds to reflecting the lengths of the four chosen sides about their common average .",
    "these involutions , together with the tetrahedral symmetries , form a group of 144 symmetries of the @xmath0symbol , isomorphic to @xmath669 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "v.  g.  turaev pointed out to me that the term @xmath670 in the phase part of the formula for a tetrahedron @xmath11 is reminiscent of the dehn invariant @xmath671 .",
    "actually it would be fairer to say that it is the `` hadwiger measure '' ( or `` steiner measure '' ) @xmath672 .",
    "both invariants are connected with problems of equidissection of three - dimensional polyhedra .",
    "two polyhedra are _ scissors congruent _ if one may be dissected into finitely - many subpolyhedra which may be reassembled to form the other .",
    "( hilbert s third problem was to determine whether three - dimensional polyhedra with equal volumes were , as is the case in two dimensions , scissors - congruent .",
    "dehn used his invariant to solve this problem in the negative . )    the modern way of looking at the problem is to define a grothendieck group of polyhedra @xmath673 .",
    "we take @xmath674linear combinations of polyhedra in @xmath21 with the relations : @xmath675 volume is an obvious homomorphism @xmath676 .",
    "the dehn invariant is a less obvious one @xmath677 , defined for a polyhedron by summing , over its edges , their lengths tensor dihedral angles : @xmath678 sydler proved that these two invariants suffice to _ classify _ polyhedra up to scissors - congruence : two such are scissors - congruent _ if and only if _ they have the same volume and dehn invariant .",
    "see cartier @xcite for more details .",
    "if we look for homomorphisms @xmath676 which are _ continuous _ under small perturbations of vertices of a polyhedron , then volume is the only one ( up to scaling ) . however , if we remove the condition on degenerate polyhedra from the axioms defining @xmath673 , there is a four - dimensional vector space of continuous homomorphisms , spanned by the following _ hadwiger measures _ ( picked out as eigenvectors under dilation ) : @xmath679 see milnor @xcite or klain and rota @xcite for more on these beautiful functions .",
    "[ t : dehn ] the regge symmetry takes euclidean tetrahedra to euclidean tetrahedra , preserving volume , dehn invariant and hadwiger measure @xmath680 .",
    "( remark : simple examples show that regge symmetry does not preserve the surface area measure @xmath681 . )    the tour - de - brute - force of trigonometry in appendices b and d of @xcite contains all the calculations necessary to prove this .",
    "they demonstrate that under the regge symmetry , which is a rational linear transformation @xmath682 of the six edge lengths , the dihedral angles also transform according to @xmath682 .",
    "the orthogonality of this matrix and the fact that we may view the dehn invariant as being in @xmath683 demonstrate its invariance , as well as that of @xmath680 .",
    "the volume is checked by straightforward calculation using the cayley determinant .",
    "the fact that a tetrahedron is scissors - congruent to its mirror - image was proved by gerling in 1844 ( see neumann @xcite ) , using perpendicular barycentric subdivision about the circumcentre .",
    "one would expect that for the regge symmetry , which is also a `` generic '' scissors congruence ( as opposed to a `` random '' coincidence of volume and dehn invariant for two specific tetrahedra ) , a similar general construction might be given .",
    "what is it ?      1.ponzano and regge give an explicit formula for the exponential decay of the @xmath0symbol , in the case when no euclidean tetrahedron exists .",
    "amazingly , it is an analytic continuation of the main formula , incorporating the volume of the _ minkowskian _ tetrahedron which exists instead , and with the oscillatory phase term converted into a decaying hyperbolic function .",
    "can this be extracted from a similar procedure ?",
    "3.the calculation in this paper is comparatively crude , since it computes a pairing of 12linear invariants when one could really do with a pairing of 4linear invariants ( see the remark of section [ 4def ] ) .",
    "the space whose quantization gives quadrilinear invariants is 2dimensional , in fact a sphere with a non - standard khler structure .",
    "can one work directly on this space instead ?",
    "( possibly any advantage in dimensional reduction is lost when one needs to do explicit calculations , which end up like the ones here ) .",
    "4.can similar formulae be obtained for other groups , and does their associated geometry have any physical meaning ? the @xmath0symbols are scalars only for multiplicity - free groups such as @xmath1 . in general",
    "they live in the tensor product of four trilinear invariant spaces , in which one would need preferred bases ."
