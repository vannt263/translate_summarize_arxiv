    "a few years after paczyski s proposal ( paczyski  1986 ) , the  collaboration engaged in long term microlensing observations towards the magellanic clouds in order to probe the galactic halo . 1 and  experiments set strong limits on the maximum contribution of low mass objects to the halo of the milky way ( alcock  et  al .",

    ", the optical depth has been estimated by  as @xmath0 , from 8 events ( alcock et al .",
    "1997a ) ; the time scales associated with these events indicate high mass lenses ( @xmath1 ) that are not observed visually .",
    "based on 2 candidates , 1 gave an upper limit on the halo mass fraction in s ( ansari et al .",
    "1996 ) that is below that required to explain the rotation curve of our galaxy .. ] it has been suggested that the lenses might be in the bar / disk of the  itself ( sahu  1994,wu  1994 ) ; but simple dynamical arguments seem to rule out this possibility ( gould 1995 ) . nevertheless , more complicated  models allow for a larger optical depth ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "microlensing search provides a test of the halo - lens hypothesis ; in this model both the optical depth and the typical durations should be similar towards the  and the .",
    "to date , two  events have been observed ; they are significantly longer than the average for  events",
    ". however , no definite conclusion can be drawn from this without more  events .",
    "one candidate , -97 - 1/-97 - 1 was found in this analysis ( alcock  1997b ,  palanque - delabrouille  1998 ) .",
    "the result of a microlensing fit leads to an einstein  radius crossing time @xmath3  days .",

    ", taking into account the @xmath5 intrinsic variability of the amplified star ( @xmath6 days , see palanque - delabrouille  et  al .  1998 , udalski  et  al .",
    "this single event allows us to constrain the halo composition , in particular we exclude that more than 50  % of the standard dark halo is made of @xmath7 objects .",
    "the  collaboration sent a first level alert for this event on may   @xmath8 ,  1998 , followed by an announcement that a caustic crossing had occurred on june   @xmath9 .",
    "a second caustic crossing was predicted around june  @xmath10 .",
    "after a planned technical maintenance , we could only observe in great detail the end of the second caustic crossing . using this data alone , we could extract a limit on the caustic crossing time , which together with public data from  enabled us to determine ( at  a  90%   likelihood ) that the deflector is in the  ( afonso  et  al .",
    "this result has been confirmed and improved by other groups , leading to a common publication ( afonso  et  al .",
    "1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "since august  1996 , we have been monitoring 66  one - square - degree fields towards the .",
    "of these , data prior to may 1998 from 25  square - degrees spread over 43  fields are being analyzed .",
    "this represents 450  gbytes of raw data , and about 100  days of to produce the light curves .",
    ".results of microlensing fits to the candidate 2 - -1 and 2 - -2 .",
    "@xmath11 is the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath12 is the impact parameter , and @xmath13 are the blending coefficients in both colors . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     about 90  images of each field were taken , with exposure times from 3  min in the center to 12  min in the outermost regions ; the sampling is one point every 5  days on average .",
    "we report a preliminary analysis of the light curves of 17.5  million stars using a new set of selection criteria to isolate microlensing candidates . starting from the images we built a star catalog using the  photometry package , and then removed the 90% most stable stars . among stars with the most significant variations",
    ", we used the quality of the microlensing fit to select the candidates . in order to maximize the number of surveyed stars and to study the background of microlensing searches",
    ", we did not remove any star based solely on its position in the color - magnitude diagram . with this strategy",
    ", we characterized the blue bumper stars that mimic a microlensing signal . in this way we removed the stars , located in the upper left of the color - magnitude diagram , that pass all cuts , but have the following features : @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the red(blue ) observed amplifications . among the 17.5  million light curves",
    ", two events passed all the cuts ( see  table  [ cand1 ] ) .",
    "event 2 - -1 is a main sequence star blended in red ( 76%  of  the  visible  flux  was  magnified ) .",
    "event 2 - -2 is located just under the red giant clump , and necessitates a deeper photometry study to confirm its validity ; it is consistent nevertheless with being achromatic .    to set conservative limits on the halo mass fraction @xmath17 comprised of compact objects of mass @xmath18",
    ", we can assume that the observed events are in the dark halo .",
    "we only consider the standard spherical halo model described in palanque - delabrouille  et  al .",
    "the most probable mass associated with both candidates is determined by finding the mass for which the ( near  gaussian ) distribution of @xmath19 peaks at the geometric mean @xmath20 the resulting mass is found to be @xmath21 .",
    "we can also define a 68% confidence interval as follows : the upper ( lower ) bound is determined as the mass for which 16% of detected events would have durations greater ( less ) than @xmath22 .",
    "this mass interval is found to be : @xmath23 \\ , { \\rm m}_\\odot$ ] .",
    "let @xmath24 be the total expected number of events for the standard halo model ( considering  our  detection  efficiency ) . to be conservative",
    ", we simply consider our two candidates without taking their mass into account . in this way ,",
    "the 95% cl poisson limit for a given mass is obtained by computing the expected number of events  @xmath25 compatible with the observations : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the poisson probability of observing @xmath28 events where @xmath29 are expected .",
    "the fraction  @xmath17 for each mass  @xmath18 is given by @xmath30 .",
    "this allows us to put a preliminary constraint excluding ( at 95  % cl ) that 60  % of the dark halo is composed of objects in the range  @xmath31 \\ ; \\rm{m}_\\odot$ ] ( see fig .  [ exclusion ] ) .",
    "there is growing evidence , from three different  data sets ( 1- , 2- , and 2- ) that the standard spherical halo model fully comprised of @xmath32 \\ ; m_{\\odot}$ ] s is inadequate .",
    "the only way to evade this limit is to suppose that the masses of the s are greater than @xmath33 , or to consider non spherical halos .",
    "another way to understand the observed events is to assume that they are due to self - lensing , in which case it is important to study their spatial distribution on the face of the . in that respect ,",
    "it is worth noting that our limit is derived from more than 17  million stars spread over 43  square degrees , in comparison with the  experiment that monitored 9  millions stars covering 11  square degrees of the  bar ( alcock et al .",
    "finally , more exotic microlensing events ( parallax effect , binary lens ... ) would allow us to locate precisely some lenses , and so to test the self - lensing hypothesis .",
