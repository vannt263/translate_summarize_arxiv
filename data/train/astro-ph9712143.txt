    "the temperature field @xmath1 , associated with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , is usually assumed to be a homogeneous and isotropic gaussian random field , i.e. the n - point probability density function is a multivariate gaussian characterized by the 2-point correlation function @xmath2 or equivalently the radiation power spectrum @xmath3 .",
    "the form of the temperature field at recombination is related to the initial density field coming from quantum fluctuations during an inflationary era in the very early stages of the history of the universe .",
    "however , other sources of density fluctuations ( such as topological defects ) may emerge at these early times and generate a non - gaussian random field . in any case",
    "future high precision maps should be searched for any traces of non - gaussianity since both foregrounds and systematic errors can leave non - gaussian imprints as well .    whereas very accurate temperature maps can be obtained for the standard inflationary model ( at the level of @xmath4 in the radiation power spectrum ) ,",
    "this is not the case for scenarios based on topological defects . in particular ,",
    "the best known of these models is the one generated by cosmic strings ( turok 1996 ) , which results in temperature maps approximately gaussian on scales that span from relative small ( a few arcminutes according to gott iii et al .",
    "1990 ) to large angular scales .",
    "monopoles and textures generate maps which are also gaussian at large angular scales but not at small scales ( shellard 1996 ) .",
    "the texture and monopole maps show an asymmetric distribution with a positive tail decreasing more slowly than in the gaussian case ( turok 1996 ) .    taking into account the present uncertainty in characterizing the temperature distributions for some non - standard scenarios , in this paper we will explore several non - gaussian models .",
    "we consider a @xmath0 model for the temperature distribution function that satisfies the previous two properties , asymmetry and an exponential tail , and a laplace model that represents a symmetric distribution with exponential tails .",
    "moreover , we will also study a toy model which has the property of having a gaussian marginal distribution but a non - gaussian 2-point probability density function , a property that appears in the cosmic string maps ( gott iii et al .",
    "as it is shown in figures 12a , b of that paper , the temperature 1-point probability density function of cosmic strings is gaussian on scales above a few arcminutes whereas the one of the temperature gradient shows a clear non - gaussian behaviour . on the other hand , the patchy behaviour in a cmb map associated to such network",
    "can be represented by the mentioned toy model ( see  2.2 ) .    in the analysis of the 2d temperature maps",
    ", we will consider the correlation of the excursion sets ( or regions ) above a certain threshold .",
    "for the 3d matter density field , such correlations were introduced by kaiser ( 1984 ) assuming a gaussian 2-point probability density function to study the correlation function of rich clusters .",
    "he found an amplification with respect to the correlation function associated with the underlying matter fluctuations .",
    "this was applied ( martnez - gonzlez & sanz 1988 ) to test models of biased structure formation in several scenarios .",
    "coles ( 1989 ) modeled the matter density field with a 1d gaussian , log - normal and a @xmath5 distributions ( the 2 non - gaussian distributions were used in an attempt to allow for non - linear evolution ) to study the correlation function of both peaks and excursion sets ( in this last case , the politzer & wise 1984 approximation was assumed ) .",
    "the excursion sets are easier to identify in the maps than the peaks and they carry very similar information at high thresholds .",
    "in fact , the number of maxima and excursion sets above a threshold coincides asymptotically .",
    "for the 2d temperature field , non - gaussian statistics have been applied by coles & barrow ( 1987 ) to obtain the mean size and frecuency of occurrence of the excursion sets above a given level for different random fields .",
    "such properties depend only on the 1-point probability density function .",
    "on the other hand , pompilio et al . (",
    "1995 ) used a multifractal analysis of the temperature scans to explore the possibility of distinguishing between gaussian fluctuations and non - gaussian ones produced by a network of cosmic strings .",
    "finally , kogut et al . (",
    "1995 ) used the peak correlation function in the cobe - dmr 2-year sky maps to test for a class of non - gaussian models . in the last paper ,",
    "the temperature maps are generated using a spherical harmonic decomposition whose multipole components @xmath6 are drawn from gaussian , log - normal and @xmath7 distributions .",
    "they find that the 2-point correlation of peaks is a better discriminator between gaussian and non - gaussian temperature fields than the genus and the 3-point correlation function .",
    "kogut et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also carried out a similar analysis with the dmr 4-year sky maps .    in a previous paper , we studied some geometrical properties of the cmb maxima above a given level ( mean number , curvature and ellipticity ) assuming gaussian temperature fluctuations ( barreiro et al .",
    "1997 ) , to discriminate among standard cdm models . in this paper",
    ", we will use the correlation of excursion sets to test the gaussianity of the cmb temperature fluctuations in the sky , including the presence of noise .",
    "an advantage of using this quantity is that it is very easy to identify all the excursion sets ( i.e. pixels above a fixed threshold ) in temperature maps .",
    "these correlations are amplified by a purely statistical effect with respect to those associated with the temperature field .",
    "they carry information on the 2-point probability density function , allowing us to distinguish between two different distributions even if the underlying 1-point probability density function is the same .",
    "the latter point will become clear with the use of some reference toy models .",
    "we discuss , in  2 , the different 2-point probability density functions generated in two different ways .",
    " 3 is dedicated to calculating the correlation of excursion sets for different models in the case of an ideal experiment whereas in  4 we include noise .",
    "finally , in  5 and  6 , we give the main results and conclusions of the paper , respectively .",
    "we are interested in several gaussian and non - gaussian distributions that could represent the temperature field produced in different cosmological scenarios .",
    "inflationary models will generate gaussian random fields whereas other models such as those derived from topological defects will in general give rise to non - gaussian ones .",
    "we shall introduce the chi - squared probability density function as a simple distribution that asymptotically contains the gaussian one .",
    "it has already been used in different cosmological contexts , in relation to the large scale structure ( coles 1989 ) , to study topological properties of the cmb ( coles & barrow 1987 ) and as a test of gaussianity in the _ cobe_-dmr four - year sky maps ( kogut et al .",

    "then , it is possible to calculate the 2-pdf for y , as well as for the sum of n independent random vectors of this type .",
    "the special case @xmath20 then corresponds to a pair of independent @xmath0 univariate distributions with n degrees of freedom multiplied by @xmath21 . in the appendix",
    ", we derive the 2-pdf for such a bivariate @xmath0 distribution , resulting in the following expressions ( @xmath22 ) :    @xmath23 : @xmath24    @xmath20 : @xmath25 ^ 2    e^{-\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2 } } \\frac{y_1+y_2}{\\sigma } }   \\ , , \\ ] ]    @xmath26 : @xmath27    where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the bessel and modified bessel function of the first kind , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is asymmetric and extends from 0 to @xmath13 .",
    "since the temperature field is assumed to have zero mean , we will center this distribution in the following calculations , which are also extended to negative values . in the limit @xmath30",

    "\\c ) laplace    the laplace 1-pdf is given by :    @xmath32    following mcgraw & wagner ( 1968 ) , it is possible to generalize the laplace distribution to a 2-pdf if we assume elliptical symmetry properties .",
    "an elliptically symmetric distribution is characterized by a 2-pdf whose contour lines of equal height are ellipses in the @xmath33 plane and satisfies : @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",

    "this distribution is symmetric and extends from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "notice that for the case @xmath20 the laplace 2-pdf is not given as the product of the 1-pdf s .",
    "we will show in the present section a simple method to generalize a 1-pdf to a 2-pdf ( berry 1973 , jones 1996 ) .",
    "this generalization has been used by the first author to describe the statistical properties of echoes diffracted from rough surfaces .",
    "if we have a process with correlation @xmath10 and described by a 1-pdf f(x ) , with mean @xmath31 and variance @xmath9 , then , the distribution :    @xmath39    is a 2-pdf with correlation @xmath10 and marginal distributions given by the original 1-pdf . here",
    "@xmath40 is the dirac delta distribution centered on @xmath41 .",
    "this distribution extends in the same range as the f(x ) being considered and satisfies the interesting properties : @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 for @xmath45 , i.e. , the same limits that can be obtained for the bivariate gaussian .",
    "this generalization is a simple example which shows that knowledge of the 1-pdf and the correlation allows many possibilities for the 2-pdf .",
    "we will construct this 2-pdf for the gaussian and non - gaussian fields considered previously , and we will compare the correlation of regions obtained in this way with those obtained from the standard distributions given in @xmath46 . a cmb map associated to this toy model represents a surface consisting of flat regions separated by vertical walls whose rms height is @xmath47 , @xmath48 being the dispersion of the underlying 1-pdf ( berry , 1973 ) .",
    "in particular , for the gaussian 1-pdf this could mimic the patchy behaviour given by the kaiser - stebbins effect produced by a network of long straight strings ( kaiser & stebbins 1984 , pompilio et al .",
    "1995 ) . for a simulation of the kaiser - stebbins effect see magueijo & lewin ( 1997 )",
    "kaiser ( 1984 ) has calculated the 2-point correlation function of excursion sets above a threshold @xmath49 for a 3d gaussian field of variance @xmath9 and mean value zero .",
    "we will follow the same procedure for the distributions considered in this paper .",
    "the probability that a randomly chosen point lies above a certain level @xmath50 is :    @xmath51    if we choose another point at distance r from the first , the probability that the field at both points takes a value exceeding that threshold is :    @xmath52    where @xmath10 is the correlation of the field .",
    "therefore , the 2-point correlation function for the excursion sets , @xmath53 , is :    @xmath54    @xmath55 gives the fractional excess probability that a point @xmath56 lies above @xmath57 , given that @xmath58 also exceeds that threshold and @xmath59 .",
    "next we shall introduce the normalized correlation @xmath60 associated to the characteristic function of an excursion set h(x ) defined by :    @xmath61    then the correlation @xmath60 is the standard correlation coefficient of h(x ) : @xmath62/ [ \\sigma_h(x_1 ) \\sigma_h(x_2)]$ ] with @xmath63 .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the relation :    @xmath64    we note that @xmath65 for the standard gaussian , standard chi - squared and toy model distributions .",
    "we have also proved that this result is valid for high thresholds in the standard laplace case , and it applies for the @xmath66 s considered in the present paper .",
    "@xmath55 at zero lag ( @xmath67 ) only contains information about the 1-pdf , however @xmath68 for any distribution .",
    "since the information from the 2-pdf is only encoded in the shape of the correlation of excursion sets and not in its normalization , it is better to use @xmath60 to test the discriminating power of the 2-pdf .",
    "the standard and toy model procedures will be considered separately .",

    "\\b ) non - gaussian    as explained in @xmath46 , the chi - squared distribution has mean value @xmath31 , different from zero , and it must be centered if we want this distribution to describe the temperature field . to take this into account , the integrals appearing in @xmath69 and @xmath72 have been evaluated between @xmath75 and @xmath13 .",
    "this procedure is completely equivalent to centering the @xmath14 distribution and taking the limits as shown in equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "then , @xmath69 is given by :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "for the laplace case , we have :    @xmath78    for both the @xmath0 and laplace distributions @xmath72 , and therefore @xmath74 , must be numerically evaluated .      for a 2-pdf",
    "generated as explained in @xmath79 , @xmath80 and so the correlation of regions has a very simple form :    @xmath81    where @xmath10 is the correlation of the process .    in the top left plot of figure 2",
    ", the normalized correlations of excursion sets above @xmath82 versus @xmath10 for a gaussian , @xmath14 with n=1,30,60 degrees of freedom and laplace standard distributions are shown .",
    "the different distributions go to zero when @xmath10 goes to zero , except for the laplace case due to the fact that its 2-pdf does not tend to the product of the 1-pdf s .",
    "we see that there are large quantitative differences between the gaussian and non - gaussian distributions .",
    "as expected , when n increases the @xmath0 correlation approaches the gaussian one .",
    "for comparison , the @xmath74 for @xmath5 calculated by coles ( 1989 ) using the approximation of politzer & wise ( 1984 ) is also plotted .",
    "it is shown that this approximation only applies acceptably well for small @xmath10 s , as was already pointed out by coles .",
    "for high values of @xmath10 the approximation clearly overestimates the actual normalized correlation of regions for the @xmath5 distribution . in the bottom",
    "left corner of figure 2 , the same distributions are plotted for a threshold @xmath83 . we see that increasing the threshold amplifies the difference between the gaussian and non - gaussian distributions . notice that in the case of the toy model , @xmath74 is given by the simple relation of equation ( 18 ) .",
    "we emphasize that even if we have two fields with the same correlation and 1-pdf ( as the case for the standard and toy model procedure with the same marginal pdf ) , we can discriminate between them using the correlation of regions .",
    "in a real experiment , the presence of instrumental noise modifies the correlations calculated in @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , the result will depend on the amplitude of the signal and then we need to choose specific cosmological models .",
    "whereas for the standard inflationary scenario with gaussian temperature fluctuations , the radiation power spectrum can be determined very accurately once the matter content is specified , this is not the case for other alternative scenarios such as topological defects",
    ". we will assume the same radiation power spectrum for all the gaussian and non - gaussian distributions that we consider .",
    "we expect that the differences in a more realistic case , where the appropriate power spectra are known , are at least as large as the ones found under this assumption .",
    "in particular , we consider in the present section a flat cdm model ( baryon content @xmath85 , hubble constant h=0.5 , cosmological constant @xmath86 ) with adiabatic fluctuations and a harrison - zeldovich primordial spectrum , kindly provided by n.sugiyama .",
    "the @xmath3 s have been normalized to the cobe 2-year maps ( cayn et al .",
    "1996 ; this normalization does not appreciably change with the 4-year data ) being the signal dispersion @xmath87 for an antenna of fwhm=@xmath88 and a smoothing of the same width .",
    "we also include the effect of noise that is assumed to be gaussian white noise .",
    "following standard observational procedures , we have filtered signal plus noise with a gaussian with the same width as the antenna .",
    "the angular correlation function for the cosmological signal with a gaussian beam profile is given by :    @xmath89    and its normalized correlation @xmath90 : @xmath91 @xmath92    where @xmath48 is the gaussian dispersion of the antenna ( @xmath93fwhm ) .",
    "the correlation @xmath94 and the dispersion @xmath95 for the filtered noise are very well approximated by ( @xmath96 rad ) :    @xmath97    @xmath98    we choose different levels of noise , fixing the noise amplitude @xmath99 in order to obtain @xmath100 after smoothing with a @xmath88 fwhm gaussian window .",
    "these levels of noise cover the range of sensitivities expected for future experiments ( e.g. map , planck surveyor mission ) .",
    "the presence of noise produces distortions in the distributions considered .",

    "the new 1-pdf and 2-pdf are given by :    @xmath102    @xmath103    where @xmath104 and @xmath105 refer to the distributions of the noise and the signal respectively .",
    "the integrals are evaluated over the range covered by the given signal distribution .",
    "the variance of the new process is given by @xmath106 and its correlation , for angles greater than the coherence angle @xmath107of the noise ( @xmath108 ) , can be approximated by the expression @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the signal  to  noise ratio .",

    "the normalized correlation of excursion sets above a threshold gives us different information from that of the 2-point correlation of the temperature fluctuations , since we obtain additional information about the 2-pdf .",
    "for this reason , our method is of especial interest for discriminating between different distributions of the temperature fluctuations for a given power spectrum .",
    "in fact , as we have already pointed out , even if we have two fields described by the same 1-pdf and correlation , we can show that it is possible to discriminate between them through the correlation of regions .",

    "even if the errors were underestimated , we do nt expect our results to be very much affected since the difference between distributions is , generally , very clear . in addition , performing a simple poissonian calculation of errors suggests that they are larger in the gaussian case . using a @xmath8 test",

    "amplify the difference among the considered distributions .",
    "however it also produces a rapid fall in the number of excursion sets above @xmath66 and thus higher statistical errors , what leads to smaller confidence levels in the separation of the models . on the other hand ,",
    "the smaller the threshold the closer @xmath74 for the different distributions , since in the limit @xmath141 all the pixels are above @xmath66 and the correlation of regions is zero for all the distributions .",
    "we have presented a method for testing the gaussianity of the cmb temperature fluctuations in the sky based on the normalized correlation function of excursion sets above a given threshold .",
    "it can be used to distinguish between standard inflationary scenarios of generation of density fluctuations and those based on topological defects as well as to search for any trace of non - gaussianity due to systematic errors or foregrounds .",
    "such a technique was first introduced in cosmology by kaiser ( 1984 ) to study the correlation of galaxy clusters in the context of biased scenarios of galaxy formation .    as an application",
    ", we have constructed 2-pdf s from the gaussian , @xmath0 and laplace 1-pdf s in two different ways . from these , we have obtained the normalized correlation of excursion sets including different levels of noise .",
    "this correlation contains additional information to that of the simple radiation power spectrum .",
    "our main conclusion is that , using the correlation of excursion sets above high thresholds ( e.g. @xmath142 ) on subdegree scales , it is possible to discriminate between different distributions even if the 1-pdf and correlation are the same .",
    "in particular , we are able to clearly distinguish between the gaussian and @xmath133 cases even in the presence of certain levels of noise within the range of sensitivities expected for future experiments . increasing the threshold",
    "amplify the differences among the considered distributions but also the statistical errors , leading to smaller confidence levels .    finally , the correlation of regions can also be used to compare different @xmath140 models though it is less efficient than directly using the radiation power spectrum .",
