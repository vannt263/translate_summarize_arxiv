    "the goal of this paper is to give a generalization of a theorem of shafikov and sukhov @xcite , @xcite , concerning local polynomial convexity of open whitney umbrellas .",
    "recall that a standard open ( or unfolded ) whitney umbrella is the map @xmath1 given by @xmath2 the map @xmath3 is a smooth homeomorphism onto its image , nondegenerate except at the origin .",
    "it satisfies @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the standard symplectic form on @xmath0 , hence @xmath6 is a lagrangian embedding in @xmath7 , with an isolated singular point at the origin .",
    "if @xmath8 is a local symplectomorphism , which we may assume , without loss of generality , to preserve the origin , then the image @xmath9 is called an open whitney umbrella .",
    "it is called locally polynomially convex at the origin if there exists a basis of compact neighbourhoods of the origin in @xmath9 that are polynomially convex ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ t.main ] let @xmath8 be an arbitrary smooth symplectomorphism",
    ". then the surface @xmath10 is locally polynomially convex at the origin .",
    "this result was proved for a generic real - analytic @xmath11 in @xcite and for a generic smooth @xmath11 in @xcite .",
    "our theorem establishes polynomial convexity in _ full generality in this context .",
    "one immediate application of our main result is the following . _    [ c:1 ] for @xmath12 and @xmath11 as in theorem  [ t.main ] , there exists @xmath13 sufficiently small , such that any continuous function on @xmath14 can be uniformly approximated by holomorphic polynomials .    for the proof of theorem  [ t.main ] our approach is similar to that in @xcite : one constructs an auxiliary real analytic hypersurface @xmath15 that contains the standard umbrella @xmath12 .",
    "the hypersurface @xmath15 is singular at the origin , but it is smooth and strictly pseudoconvex at all other points .",
    "then one considers the so - called _ characteristic foliation on @xmath16 with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that certain topological configurations of the phase portrait of the foliation guarantee local polynomial convexity of @xmath9 at the origin .",
    "direct computations yield a system of odes that determines the phase portrait , however , the system is degenerate , and standard tools from dynamical systems can not be directly applied . in @xcite",
    "the authors used the theory of normal forms of bruno  @xcite and a result of dumortier  @xcite to determine the phase portrait of the characteristic foliation .",
    "this was generalized to the smooth case in @xcite . in our approach",
    "we use a result of brunella and miari  @xcite to reduce the problem of determining the phase portrait of @xmath9 to that of the so - called _ principal part of the vector field arising from the foliation . under certain nondegeneracy conditions on the principal part ,",
    "its phase portrait is topologically equivalent to that of the original vector field .",
    "the system obtained in @xcite has degenerate principal part , and therefore , the result in @xcite could not be applied in that case . however",
    ", a suitable modification of the auxiliary hypersurface @xmath15 , introduced in this paper , gives a system with a nondegenerate principal part .",
    "our final calculations of the phase portrait of the principal part also use bruno s normal form theory . _ _    the proof of the corollary uses local polynomial convexity of the umbrella established in theorem  [ t.main ] and the result of anderson , izzo and wermer  @xcite .",
    "the proof of cor .",
    "1 in  @xcite goes through in our case without any further modifications , once the local polynomial convexity is established .",
    "our interest in open whitney umbrellas originates in the paper of givental  @xcite , who showed that any compact real surface @xmath18 , orientable or not , admits a so - called lagrangian inclusion , a map @xmath19 , which is a local lagrangian embedding except a finite number of singularities that are either double points or whitney umbrellas .",
    "it is well - known ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) that certain surfaces do not admit a lagrangian inclusion @xmath20 without umbrellas , and so open whitney umbrellas appear to be intricately related to the topology of the surfaces .",
    "the study of convexity properties near whitney umbrellas is an instrumental part in this investigation .",
    "in particular , combining theorem  [ t.main ] with the results in  @xcite we conclude that _ any lagrangian inclusion is locally polynomially convex at every point . _",
    "in this section we review how the problem of local polynomial convexity near a whitney umbrella can be reduced to the computation of the phase portrait of a certain dynamical system , a method that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "in fact , the procedure works without modifications for a somewhat more general type of isolated singularities .",
    "let @xmath21 , @xmath22 , be a homeomorphism onto its image , smooth except at the origin , and such that @xmath23 is a totally real surface in @xmath7 with an isolated singular point at the origin .",
    "suppose @xmath18 is embedded in a real hypersurface @xmath15 in @xmath7 .",
    "we define a field of lines determined at every @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the complex tangent space of @xmath15 at @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the standard complex structure on @xmath7 .",

    "oka s family of algebraic curves can be constructed from the leaves of the characteristic foliation , and because @xmath60 is strictly pseudoconvex , it suffices to ensure that the family leaves @xmath60 .",

    "then , @xmath55 is polynomially convex .",
