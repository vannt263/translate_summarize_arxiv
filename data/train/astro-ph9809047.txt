    "ages of distant objects at high redshift , @xmath8 , unambiguously constrain the expansion age of the universe at that redshift , and can be used to determine the ultimate fate of the universe ( turner 1991 ; kennicutt 1996 ) .",
    "there is a growing interest in use of type ia and ii supernovae ( sne ia and ii ) as a nucleosynthesis - clock in interpreting the abundance pattern of heavy elements seen in the spectra of high - redshift galaxies ( hamman & ferland 1993 ; matteucci & padovani 1993 ) .",
    "extensive calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis show that sne ii are the sites of alpha and iron production , whereas sne ia produce a large amount of iron relative to alpha elements ( nomoto , thielemann , & wheeler 1984 ) .",
    "since progenitors of sne ia have a lifetime of @xmath9 gyr , longer by two or three orders of magnitude than sne ii ( truran 1987 ) , the switchover of the iron source from sne ii to sne ia creates a break in the alpha / iron abundance ratio at a time at which a significant number of sne ia start to explode .",
    "accordingly , the nucleosynthesis clock records such a switchover and assigns an age above or below @xmath9 gyr , depending on whether the alpha / iron ratio is smaller than or equal to that of sn ii origin , respectively . this feature acts like an alarm clock set at @xmath9 gyr , and motivates us to measure the alpha / iron ratio at @xmath10 , to obtain a firm constraint on the expansion age of the universe to be compared with that derive from the hubble constant , for which we adopt @xmath4=6080 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 ( freedman 1998 ) as the current best estimate .    among various alpha elements ,",
    "magnesium is ideal for comparing with iron , because the best - studied range of rest - frame wavelengths from 1500 to 6000@xmath11 includes the emission features of fe@xmath0ii multiplet lines and mg@xmath0ii@xmath0@xmath12796,2804 doublet lines , so that the ratio of their fluxes , emergent from the same ionized zone , is a direct indicator of the abundance ratio ( wills , netzer , & wills 1985 ) .",
    "these wavelengths are redshifted to the near infrared at @xmath10 , and quasars are the only objects that are bright enough for their spectra to be studied . in this",
    "regard , kawara et al.s ( 1996 ) infrared observation of the fe@xmath0ii to mg@xmath0ii flux ratio for the gravitationally lensed quasar b1422 + 231 at @xmath6 is particularly important . in this letter",
    ", we compare their data with detailed models of chemical enrichment , and attempt to determine the age of the broad - line region ( blr ) of b1422 + 231 , which allows us to set a combined constraint on the cosmological parameters and the epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "the strength of fe@xmath0ii emission from quasars at various redshifts implies a much more significant iron supply from sne ia to the gas in the blr of quasars as compared to the solar neighborhood ( wills et al .",
    "1985 ; elston , thompson , & hill 1994 ; kawara et al .",
    "such an iron - rich gas results if quasar host galaxies are associated with an initial burst of star formation and then the ejected iron from sne ia is restored to the gas after the burst and the cessation of star formation . this situation is explored by modeling the chemical enrichment with two basic ingredients ( tinsley 1980 ) such as ( 1 ) the star formation rate ( sfr ) proportional to some power of the gas fraction @xmath12^k $ ] , and ( 2 ) the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) having a time - invariant mass spectrum @xmath13 normalized to unity between the lower and upper mass limits @xmath14 .",
    "the sfr coefficient for quasar host galaxies has been constrained in a narrow range from a variety of their observed features , that is , @xmath15 gyr@xmath5 from their metal abundances ( padovani & matteucci 1993 ; matteucci & padovani 1993 ) and @xmath16 gyr@xmath5 from the n@xmath0v / c@xmath0iv and n@xmath0v / he@xmath0ii line ratios of high - redshift quasars ( hamann & ferland 1992 , 1993 ) having high metallicities like b1422 + 231 .",
    "we , therefore , adopt the higher value of @xmath17 gyr@xmath5 as the standard value in this paper .",
    "theoretical arguments indicate that the imf originates from fragmentation of the gas cloud which occurs almost independently of local physics in the gas ( low & lynden - bell 1976 ; silk 1977 ) .",
    "a solar - neighborhood imf would therefore be a good approximation , and we adopt a salpeter slope of @xmath18 and a mass range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "then the gas fraction @xmath21 and the heavy - element abundance @xmath22 in the gas change with time according to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , where @xmath25 is the turnoff mass when the main - sequence lifetime , @xmath26 , is equal to time @xmath27 , @xmath28 the fraction of the ejected material from a star of mass @xmath29 , @xmath30 the fraction of the ejected material without newly synthesized elements from that star , and @xmath31 the heavy - element yield from an sn ii or ia . since all these stellar quantities , either calibrated or constrained by nearby stars , should also apply to any galaxy , we can use the formula of renzini & buzzoni ( 1986 ) for @xmath25 and the updated nucleosynthesis calculations by nomoto s group ( tsujimoto et al . 1995 ) for high - redshift galaxies .    the fraction of stars that eventually produce sne ia is @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 outside this mass range .",
    "the lifetime of their progenitors is @xmath35 gyr and its possible spread is modeled using the power - law distribution function @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) which is bounded in a specified range of @xmath38 and normalized to unity .",
    "these basic quantities @xmath39 and @xmath38 for sne ia have been constrained mainly from the observed [ o / fe ] break at [ fe / h]@xmath40 in the solar neighborhood ( yoshii , tsujimoto , & nomoto 1996 ) . from theoretical considerations kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) recently proposed that sne ia should occur only when the progenitor s metallicity is above a critical value of [ fe / h]@xmath40 .",
    "while this implies that the [ o / fe ] break at [ fe / h]@xmath40 may only weakly constrain @xmath38 , the introduction of a critical metallicity for sne ia resolves an observational puzzle ( carney 1996 ) : the galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) , spanning an age difference of several gyrs , exhibit a constant alpha / iron abundance ratio of the sn ii origin all the way from [ fe / h]@xmath41 to @xmath42 without a break .",
    "in fact , with this critical metallicity , the gc data place even firmer limits of @xmath43 gyrs from the box - shaped @xmath44-distribution with @xmath45 ( tsujimoto & yoshii 1998 ) .",
    "we therefore use this constraint on @xmath38 to date the delayed enrichment of iron relative to alpha elements in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the rest - frame uv  optical spectrum of b1422 + 231 was obtained with the ir detector array mounted on the kpno 4 m telescope by kawara et al .",
    "the observed fe@xmath0ii(uv+optical)/mg@xmath0ii@xmath462796,2804 flux ratio is @xmath47 , -type extinction law fitted to the data gives a dust extinction below @xmath48 mag for b1422 + 231 , so that this effect hardly changes our measurement of the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio . ] which is comparable to 8.9 derived from the composite spectrum of intermediate - redshift quasars at @xmath49 ( the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) , francis et al .",
    "1991 ) and @xmath50 for nine low - redshift quasars at @xmath51 ( wills et al .",
    "1985 ) . using photoionization models where important excitation processes are all included ,",
    "wills et al .",
    "( 1985 ) showed that within the wide range of physical parameters in their solar - abundance models the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio is firmly bounded between 1.5 and 4 with a typical value of 3 for the likely optical depth @xmath52(bac)@xmath53 of the hydrogen balmer continuum .",
    "therefore , the observed strength of fe@xmath0ii emission from their sample yields an overabundance of fe by a factor of 3 with respect to mg ( see also netzer & wills 1983 ; collin - souffrin , hameury , & joly 1988 ; graham ) . accordingly , with a reasonable assumption of fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii @xmath54 fe / mg , the flux ratio for b1422 + 231 leads to an abundance ratio of [ mg / fe]@xmath55 ( [ mg / fe]@xmath56(mg / fe)@xmath57(mg / fe)@xmath58 ) , where the first errors quoted correspond to the uncertainties in transforming the flux to abundance ratio and the second to the observational errors in measuring the flux ratio . throughout this paper",
    "we use the transformation formula @xmath59fe@xmath0ii@xmath60mg@xmath0ii@xmath61_\\odot=3^{+1}_{-1.5}$ ] .",
    "we note that its uncertainty , especially in the direction of giving a larger [ mg / fe ] ( or smaller age ) of b1422 + 231 is easily exceeded by the combined uncertainties of the flux measurement and chemical evolution model which will be discussed below ( see table 1 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio ( upper panel ) and the logarithmic iron abundance [ fe / h ] ( lower panel ) as a function of time in units of gyrs . using the salpeter imf and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions",
    "as described above , we calculate the standard model ( @xmath17 gyr@xmath5 ; thick line ) together with the lower sfr model ( @xmath62 gyr@xmath5 ; dashed line ) .",
    "the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio is initially maintained at a low level reflecting the low fe / mg abundance ratio in the sn ii ejecta , and then starts to increase with the enhanced fe supply due to the onset of sne ia from 1 gyr until 3 gyr .",
    "thereafter , the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio declines , because the metal - deficient gas having the low fe / mg abundance ratio of genuine sn ii origin is released in the interstellar matter from the surface of low - mass stars , with lifetimes greater than 3 gyr , that were born in the initial burst of star formation .",
    "the horizontal line in the upper panel is the observed fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio for b1422 + 231 , and the shaded region brackets the range of the errors .",
    "the intersection between the theoretical curve by the standard model and the horizontal line representing the observed fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio in the upper panel gives the age of 1.50 gyr for b1422 + 231 , which , according the lower panel , requires [ fe / h]=+0.96 at that age .",
    "this high metallicity of ten times solar agrees well with the result derived by hamann & ferland ( 1992 , 1993 ) from the n@xmath0v / c@xmath0iv and n@xmath0v / he@xmath0ii line ratios of high - redshift qsos with @xmath63 .",
    "we have examined the uncertainty of the estimated age and metallicity by repeating the calculations with different values of input parameters from our standard choice .",
    "table 1 tabulates @xmath64(chd)@xmath65(std ) for each of the changed parameters and shows that the standard model already uses the parameter values which result in a relatively low estimate of the age .",
    "use of a higher @xmath39(sn ia ) in the model makes this age smaller by @xmath66 0.1 gyr , thus imposing a lower bound of 1.3 gyr , if the uncertainties of the observed fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio is taken into account .",
    "this result can be applied unless @xmath39(sn ia ) in the blrs is drastically larger than the value constrained in the solar neighborhood .",
    "consider a galaxy at redshift @xmath2 , which is assumed to form at @xmath67 .",
    "the age of this galaxy is the time taken by the universe to expand from @xmath67 to @xmath2 . because of its high redshift of @xmath6 , the lower age bound of 1.3 gyr for b1422 + 231 constrains not only the cosmological parameters but also the epoch of galaxy formation in a highly correlated manner .",
    "figure 2 shows the ( @xmath68 ) region allowed by the existence of b1422 + 231 .",
    "two values of @xmath69 and 10 are assumed for either a universe with @xmath70 ( thin lines ) or a flat universe with @xmath71 ( thick lines ) .",
    "evidently , the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath3 , @xmath70 ) requires @xmath72 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 and @xmath73 .",
    "however , the currently accepted range for @xmath74 does not allow a value as small as @xmath75 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 for @xmath74 .",
    "figure 3 shows the predicted age ",
    "redshift relations for three representative combinations of the cosmological parameters : the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath3 , @xmath70 ; left panel ) , an open universe ( @xmath76 , @xmath70 ; middle panel ) , and a flat , @xmath77-dominated universe ( @xmath76 , @xmath78 ; right panel ) .",
    "solid lines in each panel denote the result for @xmath74= 60 ( upper line ) and 80 ( lower line ) kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , assuming @xmath79 . for the purpose of comparison , the result for @xmath80 and @xmath74= 60 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 is shown by the dashed line .",
    "figures 2 and 3 indicate that the age discrepancy , now encountered at @xmath6 in the einstein - de sitter universe , is alleviated either in an open , @xmath7 universe with @xmath73 , or in a flat , @xmath7 universe with @xmath81 . with an age set at the lower bound of 1.3 gyr ,",
    "we obtain two solutions for two different ranges of @xmath67 .",
    "however , with an age of 1.5 gyr as obtained with our standard model , an open universe becomes difficult unless @xmath82 and @xmath73 .",
    "we note that the imf in the star - bursting phase is considered to have a shallower slope ( contini , davoust , & considre 1995 ) and/or a larger @xmath83 ( rieke et al . 1993 ) than in the quiescent solar neighborhood .",
    "such an imf weighted towards massive stars was also derived from the n / c ratio in the blrs ( hamman & ferland 1992 , 1993 ) . if this were the case in b1422 + 231 , a longer age , exceeding even 1.5 gyr ,",
    "is required to reach the observed fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the existence of such an old galaxy at @xmath6 would rule out an open universe , and nonzero-@xmath77 would have to be invoked .",
    "more fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii observations in high - redshift qsos are evidently needed .",
    "the interesting possibility of a requirement for nonzero-@xmath77 has recently received some support from new distance determinations to sne ia discovered near @xmath84 ( perlmutter et al .",
    "1998 ; garnavich et al .",
    "detailed models of chemical enrichment are used to estimate the age of a gravitationally lensed quasar b1422 + 231 ( @xmath6 ) from the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio .",
    "our standard model , which matches the data , requires an age of 1.5 gyr with a lower bound of 1.3 gyr , whereas the einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath3 , @xmath70 ) is 0.60.8 gyr old at that redshift with current estimates of the hubble constant @xmath85 kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 .",
    "this problem of the age discrepancy , now encountered at @xmath6 , was first identified at @xmath86 by dating the gcs ( 15.8@xmath872.1 gyr , bolte & hogan 1995 ; 14.56@xmath872.49 gyr , chaboyer et al .",
    "1996 ) and the radioactive element @xmath88th in a very old halo star ( cs22892 - 052 ) ( @xmath89 gyr , cowan et al .",
    "1997 ) , and then at @xmath90 by dating the uv - optical spectral energy distribution for a high - redshift radio galaxy lbds 53w091 ( @xmath91 gyr , spinrad et al . 1997 ) .    in finding potential ways to remove the age discrepancy of the gcs , a brighter rr lyare calibration of @xmath92(rr)@xmath93 mag , and therefore younger gc ages , was inferred from hipparcos measurements of parallaxes of galactic cepheids ( feast & catchpole 1997 ) and galactic metal - poor subdwarfs ( reid 1997 ) . however , an analysis of hipparcos proper motions and parallaxes of galactic rr lyraes by tsujimoto , miyamoto , & yoshii ( 1998 ) _ directly _ confirmed @xmath92(rr)@xmath94 mag , as previously accepted .",
    "therefore , the age discrepancy of the gcs is not yet resolved .",
    "the age discrepancy at @xmath6 in this paper is based on the fe / mg abundance ratio derived from a simple scaling of their emission line fluxes and therefore needs to be confirmed by more detailed modeling of the emission line transfer of fe@xmath0ii in the blr using the newly available atomic data ( e.g. , sigut & pradhan 1998 ) . in this",
    "regard , although the present analysis already suggests a nonzero-@xmath77 universe ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , a definitive discrimination between an open universe and a nonzero-@xmath77 universe awaits future efforts of elaborating the photoionization model as well as observing the fe@xmath0ii / mg@xmath0ii flux ratio in more qsos at @xmath95 , because no other age - dating methods except for the nucleosynthesis - clock are able to be employed at such a great distance and early epoch in the universe .",
