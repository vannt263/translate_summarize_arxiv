    "marine protected areas ( mpas ) , used for the management and conservation of marine ecosystems , are considered effective to mitigate some of these impacts @xcite .",
    "successful mpa design is however complicated primarily due to the difficulties in quantifying the movements of organisms , especially at larval stage @xcite , in resolving the multi - scale variability of ocean currents @xcite and in apprehending the spatial scales and biogeography of the seascape @xcite .    marine population connectivity , i.e. the exchange of individuals among geographically separated subpopulations , depends on numerous factors including spawning outputs , larval dispersal , habitat availability , trophic interactions and adult movements @xcite . among them ,",
    "larval dispersal has been identified as a crucial factor for structuring oceanic populations @xcite and for determining broad - scale ecological connectivity @xcite .",
    "it also plays a major role in assuring population persistence in a mpa network @xcite , especially when target species show long - distance dispersal @xcite . as such",
    ", patterns and magnitude of larval connectivity have been used to design mpas @xcite and assess their efficiency @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the dispersion of larvae by ocean currents at basin - scale , assuming they are passively transported by the flow ( i.e. neglecting larval behavior ) , to inform the design of marine reserves .",
    "many biophysical modeling studies @xcite , including lagrangian approaches , examined marine connectivity from the so - called `` connectivity matrix '' which represents the probability of larval exchange between distant sites .",
    "previous analyses were mainly limited to the strengths of pair - wise connections , i.e. the links from one coastal site , or mpa , to another distant one @xcite .",
    "another perspective to investigate connectivity is the analysis of dispersal network topologies @xcite .",
    "recent studies applied tools derived from graph theory to document regional connectivity of near - shore mpas in the baltic sea @xcite , the mediterranean sea @xcite and in the great barrier reef region @xcite . while our understanding of connectivity at small- and regional - scales has improved , previous efforts focused mainly on coastal / insular areas and did not provide a characterization of the seascape connectivity .",
    "the significance of this shortcoming is emphasized by the growing interests for the implementation of mpas in the pelagic ocean @xcite which also shelters biodiversity and important ecological processes @xcite . designing open - ocean mpas",
    "is challenging partly because larval connectivity and pelagic habitats are difficult to assess in such vast and dynamic environment .    here",
    "we use an approach coupling lagrangian modeling and new tools from network theory @xcite to characterize marine connectivity at basin - scale in the mediterranean sea .",
    "larvae of different pelagic larval durations ( pld ) are modeled as passive lagrangian particles advected in a simulated oceanic surface flow from which a network of connected areas can be constructed .",
    "hydrodynamical provinces extracted from this transport network are delimited by frontiers which match mesoscale and regional oceanographic features .",
    "we then identify the spatial scales and structures of larval dispersal across the entire seascape and analyse connectivity metrics for the existing mediterranean mpas .",
    "we finally discussed the usefulness of our results for the design of marine reserves and the characterization of oceanic biomes .",
    "the basic ingredients are ( i ) the tracking of passive lagrangian particles ( a model for larval transport ) and ( ii ) the construction and analysis of a network of flow - mass transport .",
    "we study dispersal processes in the ocean based on a transport network in which :    * a _ node _ corresponds to a geographical sub - area of the oceanic surface , * a _ link _ , or _ edge _ , symbolizes an effective mass transport driven by ocean currents between 2 sub - areas during a given time interval .",
    "the transport network is thus composed of an ensemble of nodes ( sub - areas ) , covering the entire oceanic domain of interest , which are inter - connected by a number of links ( transport pathways ) .",
    "each link is _ directed _ in accord with the effective direction of the flow , and _ weighted _ proportionally to the amount of water flowing from one node to another .",
    "many tools of network theory were designed to examine both local and global properties of such network @xcite , allowing us to explore geophysical flows and connectivity in a new fashion .    the mediterranean sea , a quasi - closed basin with its own physical circulation and ecological functioning under important human pressure @xcite , constitutes a natural laboratory for this study .",
    "in addition , it shelters already a hundred mpas ( whose locations were downloaded from the medpan database ) implemented for protection and conservation purposes . in this context",
    ", we aim at partitioning the surface mediterranean seascape in hydrodynamical provinces , i.e. a set of oceanic subregions in which larvae / particles are much more likely to disperse efficiently within each other than among them at a given time - scale .",
    "this spatial subdivision in provinces is tantamount to detecting _ communities _ within the hydrodynamical network @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian approach is a natural perspective to characterize transport phenomena affecting free - swimming larvae @xcite .",
    "particles are advected in an eddy - resolving velocity field generated by the nucleus for european modeling of the ocean hydrodynamical model implemented in the mediterranean at a @xmath0 @xmath1 horizontal resolution @xcite , ( see also si - text01 ) .",
    "we focus on the upper - ocean dynamics over years @xmath2 with the use of daily horizontal flow fields at @xmath3 m depth ( fig .",
    "si-1 ) , representing the surface mixed layer in which larvae are assumed to be homogeneously distributed .",
    "horizontal trajectories are simulated by integrating the velocity field , bi - linearly interpolated at any sea point , using a _ runge - kunta 4 _ algorithm with a time step of @xmath4 day , matching the resolution of the simulated currents .",
    "lagrangian particles are dispersed as two - dimensional passive drifters @xcite .",
    "note that due to the non - fully incompressible horizontal flow field , vertical velocities may become significant in regions of strong divergence ( e.g. coastal upwelling ) and convergence ( e.g. deep water formation ) . neglecting vertical movements",
    "is however a reasonable assumption here because most particles remain in the selected layer over short time - scales ( @xmath5 months ) since horizontal velocities are several orders of magnitude higher than vertical ones @xcite .",
    "another simplification is the passive character of the particles , the implementation of more complex larval behavior ( e.g. vertical migration , mortality , settlement ) being envisaged for future work . under these assumptions , larval dispersal is modulated by the pld , the period of spawning and the time - varying oceanic circulation .",
    "initial ( @xmath6 ) and integration ( @xmath7 pld ) times are chosen according to the typical biological traits of marine organisms .",
    "given the limited knowledge of their life cycles @xcite , we investigate basin - scale larval connectivity from an ecosystem - based approach @xcite , rather than focusing on a particular target species .",
    "to do so , we retain two different plds ( @xmath8 days ) and consider winter ( @xmath6 = @xmath9 jan . ) and summer ( @xmath6 = @xmath9 jul . )",
    "spawning @xcite over the years @xmath2 .",
    "these modeling choices are ecologically meaningful for a number of mediterranean organisms , especially those with wide geographical range and potential for large - distance dispersal ( si - text02 ) .",
    "sensitivity of our results to the parameter @xmath10 was tested by performing additional simulations for @xmath11 days .",
    "a total of 60 factorial experiments ( with starting times covering @xmath12 seasons over @xmath13 years , for each of the @xmath14 plds ) allow the construction of @xmath15 connectivity matrices from which hydrodynamical provinces are extracted ( sect .",

    "they are then temporally - averaged to describe robust spatial patterns of larval connectivity in the entire mediterranean basin ( sect . [ climatoprovinces ] ) , finally interpreted in the context of mpa design ( sect . [ mpaconnectivity ] ) .",
    "the nodes of the transport network are defined by discretizing the surface ocean into @xmath16 quasi - square boxes of @xmath17 horizontal - resolution ( fig .",

    "hydrodynamical provinces are delimited by intense oceanic mesoscale structures such as jets , meanders , fronts and eddies .",
    "these features , which influence the topology of the transport network and thus the community detection , were recently reported to strongly impact connectivity @xcite .",
    "for instance , some mesoscale eddies are extracted as quasi - circular single provinces ( e.g. in the alboran sea and in the southern levantine basin ) , in good agreement with the flow streamlines ( fig .",

    "note also that some provinces are composed of non - contiguous boxes .",
    "this occurs especially within the pathways of fast - flowing currents as the algerian current , the atlantic - ionian stream ( south ionian , libyan and south - east levantine sea ) and the liguro - provencal current ( ligurian sector ) .      the frequency of occurrence of province boundaries is now examined across the ensemble of experiments to identify recurrent frontal systems and relatively stable hydrodynamical units which would organise larval dispersal . over most coastal / shallow regions ,",
    "boundaries occur in various locations and orientations , resulting in no apparent structure ( dark red patches ) .",
    "these disorganized patterns characterize oceanic environments with complex circulation in which spatial - scales of connectivity are highly variable @xcite .",
    "they are observed in most insular regions ( balearic , tuscan and aegean archipelagos , corsica , sardinia , crete , cyprus ) , in the tunisian - sicilian strait ( also punctuated by small islands ) and over narrow continental shelves ( italian , french , catalan , libyan - egyptian and israelian - lebanon shelves ) ( fig .",

    "large hydrodynamical units are found in the western mediterranean basin , the adriatic sea , the tyrrhenian sea ( fig .",
    "[ fig : provinces]a and b ) and only at longer time - scales in the north - ionian and levantine seas ( fig .",
    "[ fig : provinces]b ) .",
    "most of these open - ocean frontiers are located along well - known oceanographic features @xcite , some of them recognized as partial transport barriers .",
    "for instance , the so - called oran - almeria front separates the alboran sea from the rest of the mediterranean sea .",
    "it appears here rather extending from oran to cartagena , some 200 km away than previously documented @xcite .",
    "the balearic front is another semi - permament transport barrier @xcite passing north of the balearic archipelago in the balearic current @xcite and elongating eastward in winter . north of this quasi - zonal boundary ,",
    "a large hydrodynamical unit composed of the lion gyre and ligurian sea is separated from the balearic sea at short time - scale . the tyrrhenian sea",
    "is consistently organized as a two - gyre system using both plds .",
    "for the 30-day integration the adriatic sea is subdivided by bathymetric gradients ( @xmath19 100 and 200 m isobaths , i.e. off the gargano promontory ) into a northern , central and southern adriatic gyres , the two latter units merging for plds of 60 days .",
    "surprisingly , some open - ocean areas , such as the ionian , levantine and aegean basins ( fig . [ fig : provinces]a ) , are characterized by disorganized dispersal patterns and stochastic larval connectivity @xcite .",
    "they become more structured at longer time - scales with the emergence of the western ionian gyre , the shikmona gyre and a large system encompassing the rhodes , ierapetra and mersa - matruh gyres @xcite .",
    "the eastern aegean sea has disorganized dispersal patterns whereas small hydrodynamical units appear in its northern and western parts , in good agreement with its thermal structure @xcite .",
    "more generally , regions with no apparent spatial patterns at short plds see the emergence of spatial structures for longer integration time .",
    "oceanic areas already identified as gyral systems for short time - scales have their diameter increasing with the integration time , ultimately merging with their neighbors .",
    "note that most of these hydrodynamical units are quite consistent with the trophic clusters obtained from satellite chlorophyll data @xcite , suggesting they also delimits specific biogeochemical provinces @xcite .",
    "indeed , although this study focuses on passive larvae , the unveiling of well - known oceanic fronts and gyres hint that the spatial distribution of other tracers ( e.g. salinity , temperature , chlorophyll-_a _ , dissolved nutrients ) are also influenced by similar transport patterns .      the geographical structure of larval dispersal in the seascape influences largely the connectivity of marine reserves .",
    "the mpas located within large and stable hydrodynamical units ( fig .",

    "[ fig : mpavar ] ) .",
    "reserves in the adriatic and aegean seas are characterized by small dispersal surface ( @xmath50  @xmath39 ) and among the highest coherence ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this suggests a low connectivity which is also reflected in the few interconnected mpas ( @xmath51 ) despite their relatively high density .",
    "mpas located around isolated islands are associated with modest dispersal surface ( @xmath52  @xmath39 ) and low coherence ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "typical of these insular environments @xcite , complex circulation patterns ( islands wake , eddies , retention ... ) result in a moderate connectivity and high temporal variability ( not shown ) .",
    "mpas implemented within narrow continental shelves bounded by energetic currents are characterized by rather large provinces ( @xmath54  @xmath39 ) and moderate coherence ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "these reserves are situated along the french cte dazur with the liguro - provencal current , the catalan coast with the northern current , the moroccan / algerian coastlines impacted by the algerian current and in the eastern levantine basin with the jet - like intensifications of its gyre circulation @xcite .",
    "this elevated connectivity is driven by the adjacent currents that regularly intrude onto the shelf , enhancing larval dispersal along the current axis , as suggested by the numerous interconnected mpas ( @xmath56 ) along the french , catalan and israelian coastlines .",
    "in contrast , mpas situated within extended continental shelves , such as the gulf of lion and the tunisian / libyan shelf , are characterized by small dispersal area ( @xmath57  @xmath39 ) and large coherence ( @xmath48 ) . unless exceptional intrusion events ( not shown ) , the inner - shelf is isolated by shallow bathymetry holding the current off the shelf break , thus resulting in restricted connectivity .",
    "note that most mpas associated with narrow shelves and sluggish circulation ( such as the tyrrhenian , corsican and sardinian coastlines ) behave quite similarly to the latter group with small dispersal surfaces .    despite the stochastic nature of larval dispersal @xcite",
    ", local oceanographic characteristics result in the emergence of connectivity regimes",
    ". they should be in accord with the main conservation objectives to ensure successful implementations of coastal and offshore marine reserves .",
    "for instance , the allocation of mpas within narrow shelves bounded by currents would favor larval export over large distances @xcite whereas reserves created within internal seas or large continental shelves would rather promote the restoration of local populations @xcite .",
    "overall , the mediterranean mpas are not evenly distributed across the spatial partitioning of the seascape revealed by our analysis ( sect . [ climatoprovinces ] )",
    "@xcite . moreover , the `` size and spacing '' guidelines already studied theoretically @xcite , may differ depending on the local dispersal behavior .",
    "our results suggest the use of few large mpas located in each stable hydrodynamical unit of the western mediterranean basin and the adriatic sea whereas numerous small mpas evenly distributed across the fluctuating units might be preferable in the ionian and aegean seas .",
    "using a method coupling lagrangian trajectories and new tools from network theory , we study larval dispersal by surface currents in the mediterranean sea . under our assumptions , a transport network is constructed from the horizontal advection of passive particles in a modelled oceanic flow , simulating larvae of different planktonic seasons and durations .",
    "the systematic detection of communities in the network extracts a set of hydrodynamical provinces which organize the surface dispersion of larvae in the entire mediterranean basin .",
    "their boundaries coincide with both mesoscale and regional - scale oceanographic features , comprehending the multiscale processes of ocean circulation .",
    "the repeated occurrence of these frontiers allows separating the seascape in different hydrodynamical units which provide the `` backbone '' of oceanic transport impacting larval dispersal and connectivity among existing mpas .",
    "while the role of such large - scale dispersal patterns on the genetic structure of marine population remain to be determined , the hydrodynamical units evidenced may be used to optimize the sampling strategy of genetic studies . the similarity between our flow - driven boundaries and major environmental gradients",
    "commonly used to regionalize the mediterranean seascape finally suggests they might also define oceanic biomes or even faunistic units .",
    "future developments of the methodology would have to consider more realistic larval behavior for a given target species as well as full tridimensionality of the flow .",

    "this is also similar to the random noise typically added to lagrangian trajectories . for instance a diffusion of @xmath82  @xmath79 was used with a fine - scale numerical model at @xmath83 km spatial resolution @xcite , implying higher values ( that would be within our estimated range ) for a coarser model like the one we used . according to these estimates , the artificial diffusion introduced by our method is , in all cases , similar or even higher than the random noise typically added to lagrangian trajectories to simulate unresolved sub - grid processes .",
    "the need for an ecosystem - based management of marine ressources has been emerging @xcite , especially in the mediterranean basin @xcite .",
    "for instance , recent studies considered an ecosystem - based approach to optimize the location of reserves for several species based on multi - factorial analysis @xcite or to inform mpa efficiency by modelling trophic interactions within the whole ecosystem @xcite . in the context of assessing larval connectivity for mpas design ,",
    "it implies the need of considering the ecosystem as a whole rather than focusing on a specific organism @xcite .",
    "this is implemented here by simulating a range of different plds and periods of spawning which are , under certain assumptions , biologically relevant for a number of mediterranean species .    a compilation of the mean pelagic larval durations ( plds ) of 62 littoral mediterranean fishes revealed they span 10 - 70 days depending on the species considered , with large intra - species variability @xcite .",
    "considering the `` basin - scale '' angle of our study , we focus on species with a wide geographical range and potential for large - distance dispersal .",
    "these organisms are usually characterized by pelagic spawning , long plds ( @xmath84 20 days ) and offshore larval distribution ( although many combinations of such early life traits exist ) @xcite .",
    "we retain a pld of 30 days which is the best estimate available for a few iconic species of the mediterranean ecosystem , including some demersal fishes ( e.g. the groper _ epinephelus marginatus _",
    "@xcite , the blenny _ lipophrys canevai _ , the wrasse _ labrus viridis _ , the goatfish _ mullus surmuletus _ , the bream _ sarpa salpa",
    "_ @xcite ) and invertebrates ( e.g. the crab _ pachygrapsus marmoratus _",
    "we also performed simulations for a pld of 60 days since other mediterranean fishes ( e.g. the blenny _ lipophrys trigloides _",
    "@xcite ) and most marine invertebrates ( echinoderms like the sea - star _ astropecten aranciacus _",
    "@xcite , some molluscs and many exploited crustaceans @xcite ) are characterized by long pld .",
    "dispersal potential can also be influenced by other mechanisms than pld , such as early life traits .",
    "however , because the precise description of spawning strategy and larval distribution of marine organisms remains elusive , a classification was proposed based on its preferential season and location of occurrence @xcite . a large majority of the species they studied ( e.g. _ epinephelus marginatus _ , _ lipophrys canevai _ , _ mullus surmuletus _ ) spawn in late spring / early summer , so we assume that summer is the season of their planktonic life . some others ( e.g. _ sarpa salpa _ , _ lipophrys trigloides _ ) prefer a late autumn / early winter spawning , resulting in the highest abundance of larvae observed in winter .",
    "concerning spatial preferences , the `` coastal spawners '' ( e.g. _ labrus viridis _ ) release their eggs close to the bottom in shallow areas and then their planktonic larvae are concentrated in the coastal ocean .",
    "in contrast , the `` pelagic spawners '' ( e.g. _ epinephelus marginatus _ , _ mullus surmuletus _ , _ sarpa salpa _ ) spawn in the open - ocean with their larvae found widespread offshore @xcite .    to sum - up , an ensemble of lagrangian simulations covering both coastal and open - ocean regions were carried - out for each pld over all years @xmath2 with two starting dates , a winter ( @xmath6 = @xmath9 jan . ) and a summer ( @xmath6 = @xmath9 jul . )",
    "our basin - scale patterns of connectivity ( fig .",
    "2 and 3 ) are extracted from the temporally - averaged hydrodynamical provinces ( thus erasing the impact of the inter - annual variability of the circulation ) , i.e. derived from more than 30 millions trajectories per pld .",
    "it leads to statistically robust and ecologically meaningful patterns of larval connectivity in the mediterranean basin , providing useful results in the context of an ecosystem - based mpa design .",
    "once the transport problem is cast in terms of network concepts by constructing the connectivity matrix @xmath85 , a variety of mathematical tools becomes available for the question of dividing the sea into well - connected regions called `` communities '' in the network theory parlance @xcite . among the numerous methods available , we choose _",
    "@xcite , a well known algorithm in the network community , to identify community structure in our hydrodynamic networks .",
    "it retains both the `` direction '' and `` weight '' information of each link by mapping the system - wide flow induced by local interactions between nodes .",
    "this is a key feature of the method since the weights ( amount of water transported ) and directions ( of the flow ) in our transport network are crucial to represent the true oceanic circulation .",
    "this flow - based approach is indeed necessary to identify the most important structural aspects of networks where links represent patterns of movement among nodes ( such as the transport network built here ) . in contrast , other topological methods which also use `` direction '' and `` weight '' ( i.e. modularity optimization or cluster - based compression ) are well adapted to analyse networks whose links do not represent flows but rather pairwise relationships , since they are blind to interdependence in flow networks @xcite .",
    "in addition , _ infomap _ does not require to specify _ a priory _ the number of communities to be detected .",
    "it finds structures which are directly related to well - mixed regions under the flow represented by @xmath85 , and not to other structural properties ( for example , a well defined region with strong fluxes oriented towards a particular direction ) which will not lead to particle localization in that region . also , _",
    "infomap _ does not assume communities with similar sizes ( as for example the spectral partitioning @xcite ) nor suffers from the `` resolution limit '' @xcite which limits the minimum community size detectable by most algorithms .",
    "in fact , the transport network is decomposed into pieces of different sizes in regions where the flow requires so ( e.g. fig .",
    "all these properties make it very suitable for our purpose of identifying well mixed oceanic regions which are relatively less connected with the surroundings .",
    "last but not least , the minimization algorithm is computationally efficient , well documented and publicly available ( http://www.tp.umu.se/`~`rosvall/code.html ) .",
    "_ infomap _ considers an ensemble of random walkers in the network caracterized by @xmath85 , moving with the transition probabilities in that matrix .",
    "then , the method addresses from the information - theory point of view the question of optimally coding the ensemble of possible random walks . to this end",
    "the network is divided in communities and each random walk is coded by sequences of words that represent successive locations inside a community and jumps to a different community .",
    "the information - theoretic lower bound to the average length of the codeword used is given in terms of the transition probabilities and of the specific partition in communities by the so - called _",
    "map equation_. for a network characterized by a directed and weighted adjacency matrix , equivalent to our connectivity matrix @xmath85 , this map equation is :          @xmath90 is the probability to leave community @xmath88 in one random - walk step , and @xmath91 .",
    "expressions for these quantities in terms of the components of the network matrix @xmath85 exist @xcite . the second term in eq .",
    "( [ map ] ) contains the shanon entropies @xmath92 associated to the words used to codify the position inside a community @xmath88 and the word that denote the exit from that community :      the notation @xmath94 indicates sum over the nodes pertaining to community @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath95 is the stationary distribution of the random walk and @xmath96 .",
    "again , expressions for these quantities can be obtained from the elements in the network matrix @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "_ infomap _ finds the partition that minimizes the quantity in ( [ map ] ) , i.e. the partition that provides a shorter description of the ensemble of walks going in and outside the communities . in other words",
    ", it finds the partition for which the random walks remain most of the time inside the communities with few jumps between them . this minimization process uses a deterministic greedy algorithm followed by a simulated - annealing algorithm which was repeated @xmath80 times to select the best partition in provinces ( although the results were already stable after @xmath13 attempts ) .",
