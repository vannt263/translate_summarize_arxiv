    "direct detection of substellar companions in either non - magnetic or magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) continues to yield little - to - no results .",
    "the substellar donor remains elusive compared with the background emission by the white dwarf and accretion disk ( littlefair , dhillon , martin 2003 ) as well as due to variability in these systems .",
    "nonetheless , indirect techniques have established the masses of two brown dwarf donors in two non - magnetic cvs thereby supporting the existence of substellar secondaries in accreting cvs ( littlefair et al .",
    "2006 , 2007 ) .",
    "the donor sdss 103533.03 + 055158.4 ( hereafter sdss 1035 ) is found to have mass 0.052@xmath50.002 m@xmath1 and therefore is a brown dwarf ( littlefair et al .",
    "based on the temperature of the white dwarf primary star , the long - term inferred average of the mass transfer rate is a low @xmath6 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ( littlefair et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in this conference proceedings , we study whether a brown dwarf donor can contribute to accretion disk tilt around its companion white dwarf .",
    "warner ( 2003 ) suggests that long period modulations of cv light curves can be taken as indirect evidence of a tilted disk .",
    "therefore , if a brown dwarf donor can contribute to accretion disk tilt which yields long period modulations that can be observed , then another indirect technique is identified to infer a substellar companion in cvs .",
    "montgomery & martin ( 2010 ) introduce a source to accretion disk tilt that depends on mass , surface area of the accretion disk , and a slight variation of the mass transfer rate over and under the accretion disk at the bright spot . using the analytical expression developed in that work , we establish a gross magnitude of the minimum , average mass transfer rate needed to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees around a white dwarf primary . in  2 _ gross magnitude estimates of @xmath7 ( kg s@xmath8 )",
    "_ , we generate analytical data that we analyze and discuss in  3 _ analysis of the data and discussion_. in  4 _ conclusions _ , we provide conclusions .",
    "in montgomery & martin ( 2010 ) , we establish an analytical expression for the gross magnitude of the minimum mass transfer rate to induce a disk tilt , @xmath11 @xmath12    in this equation , @xmath13 is the mass transfer rate , @xmath14 is the universal gravitational constant , @xmath15 is the sum of gas particles in the disk ( i.e. , the total mass of the disk , not including the mass of the primary ) , @xmath16 is the mass of the white dwarf primary , @xmath17 is the radius of the gas stream just prior to striking the bright spot , @xmath18 is the obliquity angle , @xmath19 is the radius of the disk , @xmath20 is the gas stream velocity over the accretion disk , @xmath21 is a fraction , @xmath22 is the secondary mass , and @xmath23 is distance between the primary and secondary . note that this expression does not include effects such as gas compressibility , viscosity , and gas density .",
    "experiments are needed to establish these parameters as well as coefficients of drag and lift as discussed in montgomery & martin ( 2010 ) and thus inclusion of these unknowns is outside the scope of this work .    in this work ,",
    "we assume a gas particle mass @xmath24 kg and @xmath15=10@xmath25m@xmath1 ( montgomery 2009 ) , minimum obliquity angle @xmath26 for negative superhumps to potentially be observed in light curves ( montgomery 2009 ) , approximate supersonic gas stream speed over the accretion disk @xmath20=5@xmath27ms@xmath2 ( montgomery & martin , 2010 ) , and 10% variation in gas stream speeds flowing over the disk relative to under at the bright spot or @xmath28 ( montgomery & martin , 2010 ) . in this work",
    ", we adopt the sdss 1035 primary mass @xmath290.94m@xmath1 ( littlefair et al .",
    "2006 ) , a value that is significantly larger than the majority of white dwarf masses which lie between @xmath30 m@xmath31 ( kepler et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "we also adopt the sdss 1035 mass ratio @xmath32 ( littlefair et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "other parameters found for sdss 1035 are the disk radius @xmath33 , donor star radius @xmath34 , orbital separation @xmath35 and orbital period @xmath36 min ( littlefair et al .",
    "2006 ) . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the disk radius @xmath33 is consistent with the analytical version by paczynski ( 1977 ) ,    @xmath38    which is valid for mass ratios in the range @xmath39 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath37 , the secondary radius @xmath34 is consistent with the analytical version by eggleton ( 1983 )    @xmath40    a relation that is good for all mass ratios , accurate to better than 1% .",
    "the established orbital period and orbital separation agree using newton s version of kepler s third law thereby suggesting a keplerian orbit .",
    "the remaining unknown is the width of the gas stream .",
    "warner ( 2003 ) lists an effective cross - section of the stream as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is in @xmath43 , surface temperature of the secondary @xmath44 is in kelvin , and orbital period is in hours .",
    "this equation is based on the isothermal sound velocity which assumes an atomic hydrogen environment . from stelzer",
    "et al .  ( 2006 ) , we assume an average brown dwarf surface temperature of @xmath45k to obtain a reasonable estimate for @xmath46 .",
    "table 1 lists the theoretical data obtained from the above equations .",
    "note that the mass transfer rate due to the @xmath16 term refers to the first term on the right hand side of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "likewise , the mass transfer rate due to the @xmath22 term refers to the second term on the right hand side of equation ( 1 ) .",
    "expected mass transfer rates in various cv systems are listed in table 2 .",
    ".theoretical data for sdss 1305 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "as shown in table 1 , the brown dwarf has no effect on the minimum mass transfer rate needed to cause and maintain a tilt in the disk . in other words ,",
    "the second term on the right hand side of equation ( 1 ) can be ignored which agrees with a conclusion drawn in montgomery & martin ( 2010 ) .",
    "also shown in table 1 , the gross magnitude of the minimum mass transfer rate needed to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees is @xmath47kgs@xmath2 or @xmath48m@xmath1yr@xmath2 .",
    "although this value is comparable with those listed in table 2 , this mass transfer rate is less than that found by littlefair et al .",
    "therefore , sdss 1035 does not seem to have enough of a mass transfer rate to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees .",
    "we do note that we estimated the surface temperature of the brown dwarf which does introduce some error .",
    "however , even if the surface temperature of the brown dwarf is 1000k , the results do not change - the disk is not likely to tilt .",
    "these results suggest that cvs with brown dwarf donors may be difficult to find because the mass transfer rate is so low to induce dynamical effects that translate into observable effects . in other words , the variability in these cataclysmic variables may not be so variable that they are easily found .",
    "in this work , we establish the minimum mass transfer rate needed to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees for sdss 1035 , a cv with a brown dwarf donor . we confirm the results of montgomery & martin ( 2010 ) . although sdss 1035 may have accretion overflow at the bright spot , we find that sdss 1035 does not have a high enough mass transfer to induce and maintain a disk tilt of four degrees . however , we assume an average brown dwarf surface temperature which does introduce some error , but not enough error to change the drawn conclusion of disk tilt .",
    "these results suggest that low mass transfer rate brown dwarf secondaries in cvs may be difficult to find due to a lack of observable features such as variability that is typical in cvs with red dwarf secondaries .",
