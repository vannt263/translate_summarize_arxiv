    "a @xmath125 model can be obtained in a similar way , for example , by replacing the column @xmath126 of table [ qtable ] by the values , in the same order , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , for any @xmath108 that satisfies @xmath131 .",

    "while we have demonstrated the optimal strategies when allowing for an arbitrary no - signalling distribution , it is equally interesting to apply the more physical restriction of assuming quantum mechanics .",
    "the question is , for a given @xmath1 , how can ( in the black - box scenario ) eve select the quantum state and influence alice s and bob s choices of measurement settings in order to maximize her guessing probability .",
    "we start by asking a simpler question  given a particular distribution of measurement settings @xmath137 , what is the maximum value of @xmath1 that eve can possibly achieve ?",
    "we will then show that for all these optimal strategies , we have @xmath38 , and that for a given @xmath138 , this value of @xmath1 is optimized when @xmath139 ( for @xmath140 the previous deterministic model suffices to achieve @xmath141 ) .",
    "this therefore describes exactly the region that a quantum eve can have a non - trivial guessing probability .",
    "the task of deriving a closed - form dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath40 between the @xmath27 deterministic line and @xmath38 quantum line appears to be non - trivial except in special cases .",

    "alice and bob interpret the outputs as @xmath146 values , imposing that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 have these as their eigenvalues , i.e.  are pauli - like .",
    "this maximization was achieved in a restricted scenario in @xcite , which gave the maximum value of @xmath1 when the measurement distribution exhibits only local bias , i.e.  alice chooses 0 with probability @xmath101 and bob chooses 0 with probability @xmath147 so that @xmath148 .",

    "hence , for @xmath158 , the best approach is to use @xmath159 , for which the quantum bound coincides with a deterministic strategy @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the smallest of the four probabilities ( for example , if @xmath162 , this is achieved by pre - programming the devices to always output + 1 regardless of the input ) .",
    "we now show that for all @xmath163 with @xmath164 there exists a quantum strategy that achieves the quantum bound given in eq .",

    "this choice was made in order for the equality to hold in eq .",
    "( [ eqbound ] ) .    since @xmath144 is a maximally entangled state , we know that the guessing probability @xmath38 . however , it remains to prove that this strategy is unique , up to local unitaries , i.e.  that there is nt another strategy with a higher @xmath0 .",
    "we already know that bob s operators are uniquely specified up to local unitaries . in order to see that alice s operators are also uniquely specified , it suffices to realize that in order to saturate the bound , it must be that whichever state @xmath144 used must simultaneously be the maximal eigenvector of @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",

    ", we could define @xmath170 as we did in eq .",

    "we can now diagonalize both operators and ascertain when they have a simultaneous maximal eigenvector . up to sign changes such as @xmath177 ( which are associated with a further local unitary freedom ) , the unique result is that of the @xmath171 used previously .",
    "it is then easy to check that the overall operator has only one maximal eigenvector , which is @xmath144 .",
    "hence , we can conclude that in the quantum limit ( and within the quantum regime ) , @xmath38 . of course",
    ", in the region @xmath178 we know that @xmath27 .    finally , we investigate the measurement distribution @xmath163 which yields the largest violation for a given @xmath179 .",
    "the probabilities need not be ordered , and without loss of generality we choose the largest and smallest of these probabilities to be , say , @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "the normalization is @xmath182 to find the optimal choice of @xmath183 , we differentiate it with respect to @xmath184 .",
    "this derivative is non - negative in the range @xmath185 $ ] , and zero if and only if @xmath186 , thus this choice maximizes @xmath187 . by symmetry",
    ", we also demand that @xmath188 . therefore the optimal measurement distribution ( up to permutations ) is @xmath189 . via eq .",
    "( [ condition ] ) , we see that such a quantum strategy gives an advantage over deterministic strategies only when @xmath69 . when @xmath190 , this distribution still yields the largest violation , but is achieved through a deterministic strategy with @xmath191 , coinciding with the bound given in the main text for a general distribution with @xmath27 .",
    "we conclude that the optimal quantum strategy for a fixed @xmath192 and @xmath38 gives the maximum chsh expectation value stated in eq .",

    "<S> we have specified the optimal models for eve to maximize the guessing probabilities based on only no - signalling models , thereby specifying , for a given bell correlation , a bound on the extent of private randomness that can be extracted . while this analysis has been performed assuming eve has access to devices that can produce any no - signalling distribution ( including pr boxes , etc . ) , we have compared this to the quantum case .    a natural extension of this work is to ask whether the local strategies employed here could be used to take advantage of a key distribution scheme , where eve fakes a bell violation to undermine the security that alice and bob believe is in their key . </S>",
