    "it is these ni states that are split by correlations into the lower hubbard band @xmath4 below the chemical potential @xmath5 and the upper hubbard band @xmath6 above @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "whilst the sulphur bonding bands @xmath7 are well below the lower hubbard band the antibonding band @xmath8 is centred at @xmath4 above @xmath5 .",
    "thus the charge gap forms between the lower hubbard band and the sulphur antibonding band classifying nis@xmath0  as a charge - transfer insulator @xcite .",

    "this presents nis@xmath0  as a prototypical system to study mott - hubbard physics where fundamental questions can be addressed .",
    "in fact , recent quantum oscillation measurements at high pressures succeeded in demonstrating the emergence of a large fermi surface encompassing the full electron count in the metallic high - pressure phase @xcite .",
    "the insulating state in bulk nis@xmath0  at ambient pressure has a gap of @xmath9 as seen in optical measurements and in activated behaviour in resistivity measurements at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "this gap is derived from the above band positions by taking into account the band width of the lower hubbard band and the sulphur antibonding band .",
    "surprisingly , a deviation from activated behaviour is seen below : the resistivity @xmath10 shows a shoulder at @xmath11 with a plateau at @xmath12 and a second strong increase of @xmath10 below .",
    "it has been suggested that the complex temperature dependence of the resistivity originates from a surface layer with metallic behaviour above and insulating behaviour below in addition to the activated behaviour for bulk conduction @xcite .",
    "hall effect measurements show a diminishing charge carrier concentration as the temperature is lowered from room temperature to in accordance with activated bulk behaviour .",
    "a saturation of carrier concentration below is attributed to surface conduction dominating at low temperatures .",
    "surface conduction has been underpinned by comparison of samples with different ratios of surface area to volume showing the expected shift in the respective contributions @xcite .",

    "single crystals were grown in two steps following the procedure in @xcite : first , polycrystalline nis@xmath0  was produced via solid state reaction from stoichiometric ratios of high purity nickel and sulphur .",

    "structure refinement of single crystal diffraction measurements confirmed full occupancy of sulphur and nickel sites in the bulk @xcite .",

    "the resistivity reveals a large enhancement of more than an order of magnitude at low temperatures whilst the high - temperature behaviour above remains the same .",
    "this low - temperature enhancement is found to decrease over the course of several hours to days .",
    "such a slow relaxation is a first indication of atomic diffusion as an underlying cause .",
    "atomic diffusion is exponentially diminished at low temperatures ; thus , we count time the sample spent at room temperature between subsequent resistivity measurements presented in fig .  [",

    "in fact , when storing the sample at low temperatures ( @xmath30 ) immediately after the heat treatment the resistivity remained constant to better than over compared to a change of almost of the low temperature resistance after storage at room temperature .",

    "given the complex behaviour of the resistivity with both bulk and surface contribution , and the surface behaviour only partially understood , we aim to analyse the time dependence of the resistivity without restricting to a specific form @xmath10 .",
    "we take a drude model as the starting point with the conductivity @xmath38 here , both the charge carrier concentration @xmath39 and the scattering rate @xmath40 may be temperature dependent for instance with activated behaviour @xmath41 and power law temperature dependence @xmath42 , respectively while @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the electron charge and mass , respectively .",

    "below we find an increase towards lower temperature which can not be understood within our simple model .",
    "this is the regime where the surface contribution shows insulating behaviour .",
    "a variable range hopping model may be necessary to describe the behaviour in this range . here , the time dependent impurity concentration alters the hopping distance and possibly also the energy spectrum of the hopping sites .",
    "additionally , the presence of strong coulomb correlations in nis@xmath0  may need to be taken into account as demonstrated by the unconventional exponent @xmath75 in the activated low - temperature regime .",
    "we model the relaxing behaviour of the resistivity with a reduced charge carrier concentration due to vacancies created by the heat treatment in the surface layer .",
    "pyrites like nis@xmath0  are well known to generate so@xmath0 when heated ( firing pyrites is an established industrial procedure to produce so@xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , sulphur vacancies are the most likely impurities created by heat treatment .",
    "we find the activation energy @xmath76 for the missing charge carriers associated with the vacancy concentration @xmath47  in eq .",
    "[ eq : s0s ] to be the same as the activation energy @xmath77 for surface conduction at lowest temperatures .",
    "this points towards a low level of vacancies to be present in pristine samples of nis@xmath0  which could arise during the growth or by storing crystals at room temperature . in this",
    "case measurements of low - temperature cleaved samples could allow detection of surface conducting in the absence of vacancies on a stoichiometric sample .",
    "the surface conduction is dramatically reduced at lowest temperatures . from this",
    "we conclude that the impurity concentration must be of similar magnitude as the surface carrier concentration which was estimated to be of the order of one per unit cell of nis@xmath0  on the surface . assuming an impurity concentration of @xmath78 in the surface layer of unit cells we can estimate the diffusion coefficient for the sulphur to diffuse from the bulk to the surface , where we assume sulphur to diffuse from @xmath79 deep .",
    "we find a diffusion coefficient of @xmath1 which is large but not unprecedented with a similar diffusion coefficient of for cu in si at room temperature .",
    "an arrehnius analysis of the diffusion coefficient as a function of temperature the sample is kept at can reveal the activation energy and the mobility of the sulphur atoms .",
    "this arrehnius analysis may be carried out in the protected atmosphere of the cryostat and below room temperature in order to avoid additional sulphur depletion .",
    "in summary , we have discovered an enhancement in the resistivity of nis@xmath0  induced by heat treatment .",
    "this enhancement is found to decay with the resistivity relaxing back towards the pristine behaviour with a time constant of @xmath74 at room temperature .",
    "we identify the changes to be restricted to the surface conduction of nis@xmath0  present at low temperatures .",
    "our analysis suggests sulphur vacancies forming due to oxidisation of sulphur during heat treatment .",
    "these vacancies are refilled from the bulk through atomic diffusion .",
    "we estimate a diffusion coefficient @xmath80 .",
    "this diffusion is expected to follow arrehnius behaviour which can be tested via the dependence on temperature at which the sample is stored between low - temperature measurements .",
    "our results point towards sulphur atoms to provide surface charge carriers in nis@xmath0  as we find the same activation energy for the pristine sample at low temperatures and for the restored charge carriers after sulphur diffusion .",
    "this suggests that activated behaviour of the surface conductivity at lowest temperatures is associated with sulphur vacancies present on the surface of pristine nis@xmath0 .",
    "the time dependent vacancy concentration on the surface provides a route to study variable range hopping on the surface of a correlated insulator where the length scale of the hopping can be tuned by heat treatment on a single sample .",
