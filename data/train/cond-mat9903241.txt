    "recently the properties of systems which can be modeled by spin ladders have been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the magnetic properties of these materials depend strongly on the number of legs in the ladder . for even - leg ladders the susceptibility vanishes exponentially at low temperatures , while it shows power - law behavior for odd - leg ladders .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the spectrum of magnetic excitations is gapless for odd - leg ladders and gapped for even - leg ladders .",
    "this resembles the alternance of a gapless and gapped spectrum for isotropic antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath1 chains , where according to haldane s conjecture@xcite the spectrum is gapless if @xmath1 is a half - odd - integer while the spectrum is gapped for integer @xmath1 .",
    "the two problems are not unrelated @xcite , since a spin-@xmath1 chain can be described as @xmath2 coupled spin-1/2 chains provided the interchain coupling is appropriately chosen .",
    "although the appearance of the haldane gap in anisotropic spin-@xmath1 chains has been studied by several groups@xcite , most earlier works on coupled chain or ladder models @xcite considered only the case where the coupling between the spins is isotropic .",
    "some exceptions are the work by watanabe _ et al._@xcite using bosonization techniques , and by legeza and slyom @xcite where the density matrix renormalization group @xcite was used to determine the phase diagram of anisotropic two - leg ladders . since the results of the numerical calculations were not reliable enough to get a definitive answer , in this work we use analytic methods to study the opening of the gap in a ladder model when two or four anisotropic spin-1/2 chains are coupled with anisotropic interchain couplings .",
    "our model is such that when the interchain coupling is equal to the coupling along the chains , the two - leg ( four - leg ) ladder behaves as a spin-1 ( spin-2 ) chain .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the hamiltonian of the spin ladder model is presented , and its relationship to the composite spin representation of spin-@xmath1 chains is discussed .",
    "the model is bosonized in sec .",
    "iii , and the results known for spin-1/2 chains are recapitulated .",
    "the two- and four - leg ladders are analyzed in secs .",
    "iv and v , respectively , and the phase diagram as a function of anisotropy and interchain coupling is determined . finally , in sec .",
    "vi we summarize and present a discussion of our results .",
    "the paper also contains two appendices .",
    "the first describes our bosonization conventions , while the second gives a derivation of the renormalization group equations .",
    "consider a system of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) coupled anisotropic spin-1/2 chains .",
    "denote the spin operator on chain @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) at site @xmath8 by @xmath9 .",
    "the spins along the chains are coupled by a nearest neighbor heisenberg exchange ; the hamiltonian for chain @xmath6 is @xmath10    the coupling between chains can be taken in various forms . in spin ladder systems it is most natural to assume that the dominant interchain coupling acts between spins on the same rung and therefore has the form @xmath11 this kind of the interchain coupling is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] .",
    "when the interchain coupling is strong enough and ferromagnetic , the ground state and the low lying excited states of the ladder are those in which the @xmath3 spins on rung @xmath8 add up to form a larger spin of length @xmath12 .",
    "thus in    = 3.25 in    this limit the two - leg ladder is equivalent to a spin-1 chain in some of its physical properties , while the four - leg ladder gives an effective spin-2 chain . strictly speaking this equivalence is valid only in the limit when the rung coupling becomes very strong .",
    "nevertheless , it was established that in the isotropic two - leg ladder the haldane gap is generated for arbitrarily small interchain coupling @xcite , i.e. , its critical value is zero .",
    "alternatively , one could use the composite spin representation for spin chains@xcite .",
    "this representation is obtained by taking a single spin-@xmath1 chain with hamiltonian @xmath13 and writing the spin operator as a sum of @xmath14 spin-1/2 operators @xmath15 inserting this into the equation above , we get @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - lambda ] ) , so the first part is the hamiltonian of @xmath3 spin-1/2 heisenberg chains , while the interchain coupling between them has the form @xmath18 with @xmath19 one can view this , as shown schematically in fig . [",
    "fig : cross ] , as a ladder in which the interchain coupling is along diagonals .",
    "= 3.25 in    in this composite spin model the hilbert space is larger than in the original spin-@xmath1 model .",
    "for example , when two spin-1/2 s are added , in addition to the symmetric combinations that give the triplet @xmath20 state , the antisymmetric combination can also appear that corresponds to a singlet , @xmath21 state .",
    "it has been shown @xcite , however , that the ground state and the low lying excited levels of this composite - spin model are identical to that of the true @xmath20 model .",
    "the configurations where an @xmath21 appears on at least one site have much higher energies than those we are interested in , since they effectively break the chains .",
    "although it has not been checked numerically , it is reasonable that the same holds for the four - chain case , i.e. , the lowest lying levels are those where the model is equivalent to the spin-2 chain ; configurations where @xmath21 or @xmath20 appear on at least one site effectively break the homogeneous chain , and therefore have higher energies .    in actual ladder materials , in contrast to the cases discussed above , the interchain coupling seems to be antiferromagnetic and act between nearest neighbor spins on the same rung .",
    "however , white showed that the two - leg ladder with ( isotropic ) antiferromagnetic coupling between nearest neighbor spins is in the same universality class as the spin-1 chain @xcite .",
    "white s arguments were the following .",
    "start with the composite spin representation for the spin-1 chain .",
    "take `` chain 2 '' and slide it by one lattice spacing to the left .",
    "now , gradually turn off the coupling between sites @xmath22 away ; denote this coupling by @xmath23 .",
    "white was able to show that the system with @xmath24 evolved continuously from the system with @xmath25 .",
    "( i.e. , there was no change in symmetry and no disappearance or appearance of gaps @xcite . )",

    "( the case of anisotropic couplings will be discussed later . )",
    "= 3.1 in    start with the composite spin repersentation for the spin-2 chain .",
    "shift `` chain 2 '' and `` chain 4 '' to the left by one lattice spacing . then , gradually turn off the interchain couplings between sites which are not nearest neighbors .",
    "we are left with an antiferromagnetic ladder with only nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "therefore , as long as we have no change in symmetry and no disappearance or appearance of gaps as we turn off the couplings , the antiferromagnetic four - leg ladder will be in the same universality class as the spin-2 chain .",
    "it seems reasonable that the two are related by continuity .",
    "numerical studies have shown the antiferromagnetic four - leg ladder to have a gapped spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is hard to believe that , while performing the transformation above , we could go from one gapped phase to another _ independent _ gapped phase , and cross a critical point in the process .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable that the four - leg ( isotropic ) antiferromagnetic ladder and the spin-2 chain are in the same universality class .    one could ask how the haldane phase of the ladder arises when the interchain coupling is switched on between anisotropic spin-1/2 chains which are gapless for @xmath26 and become antiferromagnetic with finite gap for @xmath27 .",
    "it is known that for anisotropic chains with integer spin , the haldane phase shrinks to narrower and narrower ranges around the isotropic antiferromagnetic point as the spin length increases .",
    "let @xmath28 . denote the lower boundary of the haldane phase for spin - s by @xmath29 and the upper boundary by @xmath30 .",

    "the phase boundaries of the haldane phase are shown schematically for the spin-1 and spin-2 chains in fig .",
    "[ fig : crit - val ] .",
