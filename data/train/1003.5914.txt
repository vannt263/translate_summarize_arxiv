    "<S> we propose that the effective dimensionality of the space we live in depends on the length scale we are probing . as the length scale increases , new dimensions open up . at short scales </S>",

    "<S> this setup allows for some fundamental problems in cosmology , gravity , and particle physics to be attacked from a new perspective . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed framework , among the other things , offers a new approach to the cosmological constant problem and results in striking collider phenomenology and may explain elongated jets observed in cosmic - ray data .    despite the fantastic success of the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) and the standard model of cosmology , various fundamental problems have accumulated that need attention . </S>",
    "<S> many of these problems stem from the ultraviolet ( short distance ) and infrared ( large distance ) divergencies . </S>",
    "<S> there is a general consensus that we understand our universe ( with some exceptions ) on scales approximately between @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the first scale corresponds to the energy scale of tev@xmath2 which is going to be probed by the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ; the second scale corresponds to the isotropy scale of the universe , _ i.e. _ , the distance at which cosmology truly takes over from astrophysics .    </S>",
    "<S> it is becoming increasingly clear that straightforward extensions of existing theories either do not cure everything or bring in more problems . </S>",
    "<S> some radically new ideas are needed to explain the universe beyond these scales . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a novel approach introducing the concept of evolving dimensionality : the effective dimensionality of space depends on the energy scale we are probing and as the length scale increases new dimensions open up . at short scales the space is lower dimensional , at intermediate scales the space is 3d , and at large scales the space is effectively higher dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> this set - up allows for some fundamental problems in particle physics , gravity and cosmology to be addressed from a new perspective . we will also show that this model can have striking signals at the lhc </S>",
    "<S> .    </S>",
    "<S> this approach contrasts with attempts to solve the hierarchy problem by introducing extra spatial dimensions of a finite size , which open up at short distances  @xcite . in our approach , at short distances spatial dimensions collapse and shut off one - by - one , resulting in a simple @xmath3 space - time at very short distances characteristic of the very early universe right after the big bang , which has interesting implications for cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is closer in spirit to dgp models and their cascading cosmology extensions  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach proposed in this letter is not a concrete model , but rather a conceptual new paradigm , which allows one to address known deficiencies of the standard models of both particle physics and cosmology in a radically new way . </S>",
    "<S> more concrete models within the proposed paradigm are required to resolve them explicitly .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most acute problems connected with ultraviolet divergences concerns radiative corrections to the mass appearing in the higgs potential , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the one - loop corrections to the higgs mass from the top , @xmath5 and higgs self - coupling diagrams are given by : @xmath6 and grow quadratically . </S>",
    "<S> ( the contribution from the @xmath7 boson is obtained with the substitutions @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) here @xmath10 is the top yukawa coupling , @xmath11 , @xmath12  gev , @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the @xmath18 gauge couplings , @xmath19 is the quartic higgs coupling , @xmath20 is the reduced four - momentum of the higgs , and @xmath21 is an ultraviolet cutoff of the model , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the scale at which unknown physics beyond the sm takes over .    after summing over the color and polarization degrees of freedom one obtains  @xcite : @xmath22 unless the higgs mass is fine - tuned to an accuracy @xmath23 , upon minimization of the potential , these corrections result in a dangerous contribution to the higgs vacuum expectation value , which destabilizes the electroweak symmetry breaking scale . </S>",
    "<S> the sm works amazingly well by fixing @xmath21 at the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is generally assumed that this indicates the existence of new particles and laws of nature at energies above @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the alternative approach we exercise here is to keep the structure of the sm and change the dimensionality of the background on which the sm lives . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward calculation shows that in 2d all of the terms in ( [ terms ] ) are only linearly divergent , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , for the higgs term : @xmath24 while in 1d all of these terms are only logarithmically divergent , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , @xmath25 thus alleviating the fine tuning problem . indeed , from the dimensional regularization technique we know that ultraviolet divergences in field theory are associated with poles in the dimension plane . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , lowering the dimensionality of space - time universally cures ultraviolet divergences in practically all of the field theories .    </S>",
    "<S> what about gravity ? </S>",
    "<S> the most elusive concept in modern physics  the consistent quantization of gravity  is much more within the reach in lower dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> gravity in @xmath26 space - time is complicated , nonlinear , and perturbatively non - renormalizable theory . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the fundamental short - scale physics is lower dimensional , there is no need to quantize @xmath26d gravity at short distances and we should quantize @xmath27 and @xmath3d gravity instead . in any space - time </S>",
    "<S> the curvature tensor @xmath28 may be decomposed into a ricci scalar @xmath29 , ricci tensor @xmath30 and a conformally invariant weyl tensor . in 2d </S>",
    "<S> the weyl tensor vanishes and so @xmath31 this implies that any solution of the vacuum einstein s equations , @xmath32 , necessarily has a vanishing curvature , and consequently can be constructed by `` gluing together '' flat pieces of minkowski spacetime  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is most easily seen after highlighting the precise equivalence between ( 2 + 1 ) vacuum einstein gravity and gauge theory  @xcite . for a spacetime manifold @xmath33 of dimension three </S>",
    "<S> , the einstein - hilbert action can be written in terms of the dreibein ( @xmath34 ) and the spin connection ( @xmath35 ) as a chern - simons action @xmath36 the equations of motion following from ( [ chern - simons ] ) , @xmath37 = de^a + \\epsilon^{abc } \\omega_b \\wedge e_c = 0\\ ] ] and @xmath38 = d\\omega^a + \\tfrac{1}{2 } \\epsilon^{abc } \\omega_b \\wedge \\omega_c = 0,\\ ] ] demand the spin connection to be flat and torsion free , and hence the curvature of the metric vanishes , @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> all in all , einstein ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional vacuum gravity has no local degrees of freedom , _ viz . </S>",
    "<S> _ , there are no gravitational waves in the classical theory and no gravitons in the quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if the high energy limit of spacetime is described by a lower dimensional einstein - hilbert action , an striking prediction emerges : _ the stochastic background of gravitational waves would have a horizon at the frequency scale where space transitions from 3d  @xmath40  2d . </S>",
    "<S> _ interestingly , for a 3d  @xmath40  2d transition scale near 1  tev , the horizon wavelength is within the reach of the future laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3d gravity is even more simple  the gravitational coupling is dimensionless and the action is a topological invariant that gives no dynamics to the 2d metric . interestingly , there is an asymptotically safe theory of pure gravity in ( @xmath41 ) space - time dimensions ( @xmath42 ) ; asymptotic safety can also be preserved in the presence of matter fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dimensional continuation from @xmath43 to 4d is driven by the truncated exact rg equation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rg flow predicts an effective dimensionality which is scale dependent : it equals 4 at macroscopic distances , but gets dynamically reduced at short distances and space - time becomes a 2d fractal  @xcite . along the lines , the superposition of all possible lorentzian spacetime shapes ( a.k.a . </S>",
    "<S> causal dynamical triangulations ) yields the same dynamical fractal structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is noteworthy that the layered space - time structure envisaged in this letter is not fractal , but has the properties of dimensions on the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> let us assume space - time has an ordered lattice structure , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lattice ] , which becomes anisotropic at very small distances . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed set up is analogous to that of dimensional crossover in layered strongly correlated metals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these materials have an insulating character in the direction perpendicular to the layers at high temperatures but become metal - like at low temperatures , whereas transport within the layers remains metallic over the whole temperature range .    </S>",
    "<S> one can draw an instructive analogy between the standard path integral formalism and propagation of a particle on a lattice . in the path integral </S>",
    "<S> picture , a particle propagating from one to another point ( separated by a macroscopic distance ) does not always follow a straight path . instead , due to quantum fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> , it follows an irregular jagged path . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there are infinitely many possible paths that a particle can take , yet the straight classical trajectory and paths nearest to it give the highest contribution to the path integral . in the language of quantum mechanics , quantum interference of many possible paths gives a straight propagation on average . in the case of a particle propagating on the lattice </S>",
    "<S> , the geometry of the lattice , instead of quantum fluctuations , dictates the jaggedness of the path . </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic straightness of the particle s path is maintained due to the initial momentum conservation . </S>",
    "<S> this path integral analogy can also help us visualize the dimensional reduction . </S>",
    "<S> consider for example the phase - space path integral of a massless particle propagating over a 1d regular lattice of size @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the particle s momentum and @xmath47 is the particle s location . </S>",
    "<S> in this 1d case there is no longitudinal space , the whole lattice is just a set of points separated by the distance l. the particle s allowed locations are points of the lattice , and the corresponding particle s wavelengths and momenta are @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a non - zero integer . </S>",
    "<S> now take @xmath51 so that @xmath52 can be replaced by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath55 is very small , @xmath56 can be treated as a constant and @xmath57 ; eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ path ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath58/\\left[n^2l\\right ] \\ , .\\ ] ] for a particle propagating from @xmath59 to @xmath60 , the probability distribution is given by @xmath61 /\\left[n^2l \\right ] \\right| \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ probability ] , the @xmath63 distribution has a peak near @xmath64 and a peak at @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the particle most likely stays at @xmath66 at small @xmath55 and jumps to @xmath67 for @xmath68 . for time scales which are a quarter of the lattice period </S>",
    "<S> the peak of probability is at @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for energy scales @xmath69 particles prefer to stay at the point ( i.e. longitudinal space ) , while low energy particles can propagate in the transverse space .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath70 the universe is 2d and gravity , like any other force , is bound to 2d . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that this is not the case of bulk+branes , as here there is no bulk . ) </S>",
    "<S> the world is truly 2d in a sense that the only third dimension is the thickness of the brane @xmath71 ( i.e. , the thickness of the spacing between lattice sheets).the minkowski space - time metric shrinks to @xmath72 from gauss s law , the gravitational potential becomes @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the two dimensional gravitational constant . </S>",
    "<S> the 3d  @xmath40  2d space transition takes place at a temperature @xmath75 , and so the earliest observationally verified landmarks   big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  stay unaffected as @xmath76    the transformation group acting on the lattice sheets , @xmath77 , is a subgroup of the proper , orthochronous lorentz group , @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> generally one expects the lattice to fold randomly thus avoiding a creation of a preferred direction in space . </S>",
    "<S> yet , there is a preferred `` cosmic '' reference frame in which the lattice is at rest . </S>",
    "<S> the local random orientation of the 2d substructure activates non - systematic violations of lorentz symmetry in the low energy effective theory , i.e. , for de broglie wavelengths @xmath79 ( in the preferred frame of lattice coordinates ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - systematic effects induced a local deformation of the dispersion relation , but the classical relation @xmath80 still holds on average  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the observed light from distant sources is continually subject to stochastic fluctuations of @xmath81 , which introduce uncertainties in the determination of the photon wavelength @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is a model dependent parameter that controls the cumulative effect of individual fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> since the fluctuations are uncorrelated , an initially in phase collection of photons will lose phase coherence as they propagate . for a propagation distance @xmath44 , </S>",
    "<S> the cumulative statistical phase dispersion is @xmath84 where @xmath85 is chosen from some model dependent probability distribution that reflects the underlying stochasticity  @xcite . to constrain the parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> the strategy is to look for interference fringes for which the phase coherence of light from distance sources should have been lost , i.e. , @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> pks1413 + 135 , a galaxy at a distance of 1.2  gpc that shows airy rings at a wavelength of 1.6  @xmath87 m  @xcite , is a typical probe . for @xmath88 , the allowed region of the parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath89 encompasses the particularly interesting model of @xmath90 this originates in non - renormalizable interactions suppressed by the mass scale characteristic of the lattice  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations in the lattice structure would also spread a delta function type pulse of radiation in time . </S>",
    "<S> the overall time dispersion in the pulse can be related to the cumulative phase dispersion yielding @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the phase velocity of the light wave  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the pulse is not dispersive in frequency space . </S>",
    "<S> the expected time dispersion of a pulse originating at @xmath93  kpc is @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> high - precision timing observations of the pulsar b1937 + 21 ( with accuracies @xmath95s )  @xcite , provide a somewhat weaker but compatible bound , @xmath96 .    </S>",
    "<S> if in the preferred frame a de broglie wavelength of a particle becomes significantly shorter than @xmath81 , such a particle will propagate locally in 2d , rather than 3d . </S>",
    "<S> note that this does not affect the straightness of propagation of high - energy gamma rays from the source to the observer , as the overall momentum of the particle is preserved as it propagates through the spatial lattice . if the lattice is rigid enough , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , the tension of the branes that form it is significantly higher than particle energy , the particle will scatter coherently at brane junctions and move along a jagged line preserving its original direction . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to a photon propagating straight through a crystal lattice despite being scattered elastically off the individual atoms via phonon exchange . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the energy of the photon is small enough so that the scattering is elastic , the propagation of the electromagnetic wave through the crystal preserves the group velocity of the photon and its direction on the scales significantly larger than the lattice spacing </S>",
    "<S> . we can now apply this analogy to the scattering of a high - energy particle on the brane junctions in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the tension of the brane lattice and the relative sizes of the sides of its primary cell determine the refraction index . for @xmath97 , </S>",
    "<S> the particle propagates via a jagged trajectory with the degree of jaggedness given by the @xmath98 to @xmath81 ratio , which is the effective increase in the path length . for elastic interactions with the brane lattice , </S>",
    "<S> the refraction index for a high - energy particle becomes @xmath99 , where @xmath100 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the dispersion relationship in the brane lattice is very non - linear and is characterized by a fermi function with the threshold @xmath101  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of this threshold - like behavior and the smallness of @xmath102 in the effective theory at long distances allows us to elude all the dispersion - like astrophysical constraints from tev gamma rays  @xcite .    for @xmath103  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , when space becomes 1d , minkowski metric is simply @xmath104 and space and time in a sense become equivalent to each other . interestingly , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath105 was violated maximally in the big bang , then @xmath55 is also violated maximally ( assuming the @xmath106 theorem still applies ) and the fact that the time has a defined direction , while space does not , may simply come from that maximum violation ( just as neutrinos are always left - handed due to the maximum violation of parity in weak interactions ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath105 maximally violated in the big bang , may also help to explain the observed extreme matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> ( it is why the big bang would be completely @xmath105-violating , of course , which remains to be explained in this picture . )    for distances @xmath107 , space becomes 4d , which would result in certain consequences for cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if @xmath108 is of the order of the present cosmological horizon , a very small but finite positive cosmological constant can be attributed to the characteristic size of our 3d - lattice . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the @xmath109-dimensional einstein s equations admit the following metric as a vacuum solution @xmath110 where @xmath111  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this metric reduces on @xmath112 hypersurfaces to a 3d de sitter metric with @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> an observer living on the 3d lattice ( i.e. , @xmath112 ) will measure an effective stress energy tensor with the equation of state @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 is the reduced planck mass . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> the observed vacuum energy density , @xmath117 , corresponds to @xmath118 . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to the current horizon size , which within the proposed scenario is comparable to the characteristic distance between 3d sheets comprising the 4d lattice structure . if @xmath108 is of this scale , it represents the minimum value of @xmath119 which in turn represents the maximum ( but not the minimum ) value of the effective @xmath21 experienced by an observer on a 3d sheet . </S>",
    "<S> it therefore sets the cosmological constant problem in a new context : as a casimir energy due to the presence of another distant fold of the lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now focus attention on the lower dimensional crossover and its possible implications for lhc physics . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss here three immediate and spectacular consequences of this model at the lhc , which should be observable if @xmath120  tev , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , within the reach of the machine : _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ cross section of hard scattering processes changes compared to that in the sm as the @xmath121 becomes comparable with @xmath122 ; _ ( ii ) _ @xmath123 and higher order scattering processes at high energies become planar , resulting , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , in four - jet events , where all jets are produced in one plane in their center - of - mass frame , thus strikingly different from standard qcd multijet events ; _ ( iii ) _ under certain conditions , jets of sufficiently high energy may become elliptic in shape .    </S>",
    "<S> consider a @xmath124 scattering in our brane - lattice model . if @xmath121 of the scattering , _ i.e. _ , the degree of virtuality of the mediator ( propagator ) in the corresponding feynman diagram becomes comparable to @xmath122 , the mediating particle moves in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> the effective impact parameter of the interaction is now the impact parameter in the 2d plane defined by the local lattice geometry , hence the effective suppression of the cross section by the reduced phase space ( and also modified matrix element of a 2d interaction ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the spacing of the lattice @xmath98 is microscopic , different collisions will happen very large distance apart in the lattice space , and if the lattice is oriented randomly , the cross section will be suppressed compared to the 3d case ; with a more regular lattice orientation , the suppression factor could be different and even depend whether the collision took place in atlas or cms or where in the lattice frame the earth has been located at the time of the collision . </S>",
    "<S> ( such a time - dependent analysis is in principle possible , as the collision time is known to high precision . ) in addition to this purely geometrical factor it is easy to see from dimensional arguments that the energy behavior of parton - level cross sections for 2d - scattering changes compared to that in 3d . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the drell - yan cross section will drop not as @xmath125 , but as @xmath126 once the 3d @xmath127 2d crossover energy is surpassed . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that this phenomenon has not been observed in the previous low - energy measurements , _ e.g. , _ at lep and the tevatron , can be interpreted as the bounds on the sharpness of the 3d @xmath127 2d crossover . </S>",
    "<S> note that the fact that the propagator is bound to 2d , while the incoming particles move in 3d on the distances much greater than @xmath98 does not result in @xmath55 and @xmath106-violation , as the outgoing particles also propagate in 3d over long distances , due to the lattice back - reaction , which absorbs the momentum of the incoming particles in the direction perpendicular to the local 2d fold and then reemit it by giving the outgoing particles equal boost in the same direction .    </S>",
    "<S> let s move on to the @xmath123 scattering , which involves several virtual particles . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath121 in each of the propagators is comparable with @xmath122 , the spatial separation between the incoming and outgoing particles at the time of the interaction is comparable to the size of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , all the virtual particles ( propagators ) must move in the same 2d space transverse to the third dimension of the lattice , @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the outgoing four partons to be in the same plane in the c.o.m . </S>",
    "<S> frame of the collision , thus drastically different from the 3d scattering , where four outgoing partons are in general acoplanar . as discussed above , the entire c.o.m . </S>",
    "<S> frame is boosted to conserve the longitudinal momentum of the incoming partons in the direction of the beam , but that does not affect the initial planar configuration , per the argument of photon propagation through the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect , _ e.g. _ , multijet events with four or more jets at very high transverse momentum to become more and more planar as the characteristic @xmath121 approaches @xmath128  tev@xmath129 . </S>",
    "<S> the lhc sensitivity for identifying four jets coplanarities has been studied elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , if the lattice structure is similar over large distances ( which is is generally not the case , as the lattice surfaces forming it may be folded and twisted in a non - trivial way ) , _ i.e. _ , over the distances comparable to @xmath130 , individual jets at very high energy may become elliptic in shape . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the nature of the parton shower , which is generally ordered in @xmath121 ; thus one expects the largest @xmath121 s to happen at the beginning of the shower evolution . </S>",
    "<S> if several successive shower splittings have @xmath131 and the lattice orientation is preserved over the distance scale of the shower development , just like the multijet events become planar , the core of the jet will become planar as well . </S>",
    "<S> after the soft part of the parton shower is finished , the resulting jets will be elliptic rather than round in shape . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear if this ellipticity will be large enough to be observable at the lhc , particularly given the fluctuations of parton shower within individual jets ; nevertheless we believe that looking at the individual jet ellipticity as a function of jet energy may become an interesting experimental probe of models with vanishing dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> in fact these jets may have been already observed by the pamir collaboration in showers induced by high - energy cosmic rays ( the effect know as `` alignment '' )  @xcite , which can not be explained by conventional physics .    with the lhc just having achieved high - energy collisions at the half of the design energy and preparing for a decade of exciting explorations at the terascale , it s very timely to bring the paradigm of vanishing dimensions to the attention of the experimental and theoretical communities , which is the main goal of this letter </S>"
