    "the ability to detect magnetic field by optical means with high sensitivity  @xcite is a key requirement for a wide range of practical applications ranging from geology and medicine to mineral exploration and defense .",
    "a particularly important application is magnetic resonance imaging .",
    "a variety of techniques including a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid )  @xcite , cavity optomechanical  @xcite , negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond  @xcite , and bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite have been suggested for extremely high sensitive optical magnetometry .",
    "there are two ways for sensing of magnetic fields .",
    "one is based on light absorption at a magnetic resonance , for example @xmath1he atomic magnetometry by optical pumping  @xcite . another way to detect magnetic field",
    "is achieved by making use of the changes of the index refraction such as high sensitivity optical magnetometry  @xcite based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite .",
    "eit technique enables one to control the absorption and dispersion , changes the index refractive with cancelled absorption . with the presence of the static magnetic field , the left- and right - circular components of the linear polarized probe field drive different transitions , and thus accumulate different phase shifts . as a result",
    "the polarization direction is rotated , which is the so - called faraday rotation  @xcite .",
    "large optical faraday rotation has been observed  @xcite , and has been suggested to detect quantum fluctuation  @xcite , atomic filter  @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of faraday rotation to weak magnetic fields naturally suggests it as a magnetometry technique  @xcite .",
    "when an ensemble of two - level atoms is placed inside an optical cavity , the atom - cavity interaction strength can be enhanced to be @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the single - atom - cavity coupling strength and @xmath4 is the number of atoms in the cavity mode . due to the strong optical confinement and small mode volumes ,",
    "the optical cavity provide an excellent platform for strong light - matter interactions allowing for vacuum induced transparency  @xcite and all - optical transistor  @xcite .",
    "the resonator response is consequently drastically modified , resulting in substantial narrowing of spectral features  @xcite .",
    "the cavity - enhanced faraday rotation in nv centers in diamond can push the sensitivity of microwave magnetometer into at/@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , owing to the established technology for microcavity fabrication , cavities may be an attractive choice for miniaturized systems .    in the present paper ,",
    "we suggest a composite atom - cavity system for high sensitivity optical faraday magnetometry based on intracavity eit . in doing so",
    ", we apply a linear polarized probe field to couple into the cavity , and analyze the transmissions and phase shifts of its left- and right - circular polarized components based on intercavity eit  @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to combine cavity - enhanced faraday rotation and intracavity eit .",
    "our study show that the cavity - enhanced faraday rotation supports the detection of weak magnetic field , and resulting in cavity - enhanced sensitivity . for single probe photon measurement ,",
    "the sensitivity is inversely proportional to the number of atoms .",
    "with multiphoton measurement , the limit of sensitivity can be improved to 4.7(9 )  ft/@xmath5 from @xmath6nt/@xmath0 with single photon measurement . comparing with the microwave faraday magnetometry proposed by xia _ et.al .",
    "_ in ref.@xcite , the physical mechanism behinds our faraday magnetometry is intracavity eit , not the resonance absorption .",
    "the transparency peak can therefore be controlled by the driving field and the adjustable number of atoms confined in the cavity .",
