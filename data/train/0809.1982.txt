    "wimps are the most natural candidates for the second major component of the universe , cdm .",

    "e - wimps depart from chemical equilibrium very early and their relic density is diluted by primordial inflation .",
    "however , they can be reproduced in two ways : ( i ) in the thermal bath , through scatterings and decays involving superpartners @xcite , and ( ii ) non - thermally from the decay of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ; in this case the results are highly model dependent .    in this talk , which is based on ref .",
