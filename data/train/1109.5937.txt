    "recent matter wave experiments with nanometer - sized particles have opened a new field of research at the interface between the foundations of physics , quantum optics and physical chemistry . here",

    "quantum - assisted molecule metrology is now becoming a viable tool for molecular physics with prospects to outperform classical measurements in the near future .",
    "second , nanoparticle interference is well suited for studying the quantum superposition principle in a mass regime that has not been accessible hitherto .",
    "we will show how recent studies can validate quantitatively the predictions made by decoherence theory , and we will argue that matter - wave experiments will set bounds to theories predicting a modification of the schrdinger equation at the quantum - classical borderline .",

    "this includes requirements for molecular beam sources , detection schemes and ways to cope with phase averaging .",
    "a quantitative theoretical approach to describe all of these experiments is briefly introduced in sect .",
    "[ theory ] .",
    "so far , there has been no experimental indication that the quantum superposition principle may fail at any mass or length scale . however , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ fundamentallimits ] , a number of modifications of the schrdinger equation have been suggested , and in particular the model of continuous spontaneous localization may be the first alternative that can be put to a definitive test in matter wave experiments with very massive clusters .",

    "[ conclusions ] with our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "from a conceptual point of view , far - field diffraction is by far the simplest and most palpable matter wave phenomenon : when a collimated and sufficiently slow particle beam impinges on a mask perforated by equidistant slits the particle density further downstream exhibits a fringe pattern , whose period is determined by the ratio @xmath0 of the de broglie wavelength @xmath1 and the slit separation @xmath2 .",
    "such experiments have been implemented with electrons @xcite , neutrons @xcite , and atoms @xcite .",
    "more recently , also beams composed of cold helium clusters @xcite , and hot fullerenes @xcite have shown such far - field interference patterns , in complete agreement with quantum expectations , including the subtle but significant role of van der waals forces between the molecules and the material grating structures .",
    "a number of alternative interferometer concepts have been studied also with diatomic molecules : this includes mach - zehnder interferometry with na@xmath3 , using three nanofabricated gratings @xcite , ramsey - bord interference experiments , exploiting the near - resonant interaction with four running laser waves , with i@xmath3 @xcite and k@xmath3 @xcite , and the observation of the poisson spot behind a circular obstacle with d@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the scattering of fast h@xmath3 , as first studied by @xcite , has recently been extended to quantum reflection studies with he@xmath3 by @xcite .",
    "most of these experiments operate in the far field , thus requiring a collimation of the molecular beam that is significantly narrower than the diffraction angle .",
    "this condition is the reason why it is difficult to extend these far - field schemes to objects composed of , say , several hundred thousand atoms : their requirements with regard to source brilliance and coherence , interferometer size and stability , as well as detection efficiency still necessitate the development of new experimental methods for controlling nanoparticles .",
    "in contrast , near - field phenomena , such as the talbot - lau effect , allow one to operate with particle beams of modest coherence , without the need for a spatially resolving particle detector , and one can draw on favorable length and mass scaling properties . in order to show this , we start by introducing some elementary coherence considerations and the basic idea behind talbot interference .      in the absence of external forces ,",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation of quantum mechanics is formally equivalent to the helmholtz equation that governs the propagation of light .",
    "this explains why many phenomena from classical wave optics , such as diffraction and interference , find a close analogy in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "indeed , huygens principle of elementary wavelets and the kirchhoff - fresnel integral formula are closely related to a feynman path integral formulation of the dynamics of matter waves @xcite .",
    "both in classical optics and in quantum mechanics the ability to observe wave phenomena relies on the preparation of sufficient spatial and temporal coherence , i.e. of stable correlations between separate space - time points of the complex wave field .",
    "they should be appreciable over a significant portion of the diffracting element , e.g. over at least two slits of a diffraction grating .",
    "most matter wave experiments are operated with a particle beam propagating in a well - defined longitudinal direction . in many cases it is then justified to decouple the forward direction from the transverse state of motion .",
    "if we assume an initially incoherent particle source , its spatial ( transverse ) coherence depends on the effective width @xmath4 of the source aperture .",
    "according to the _ van cittert - zernike theorem _ the spatial coherence behind an incoherent source is described by the same functional form that also quantifies the intensity pattern due to diffraction behind the same aperture under coherent plane wave illumination @xcite .",
    "the coherence width at a distance @xmath5 behind the intrinsically incoherent particle source can therefore be estimated as @xmath6 .",
    "this illustrates that for massive particles with small de broglie wavelengths @xmath1 we will need either a narrow source opening @xmath4 or a long propagation distance @xmath5 to prepare the required spatial coherence .",
    "similarly , the _ wiener - khinchin theorem _ describes the longitudinal coherence function as the fourier transform of the beam spectral density @xcite .",
    "a narrow distribution of de broglie wavelengths , i.e. a good momentum selection , is therefore required if we want to prepare longitudinally extended matter wave coherence .",
    "this is a source property that can not be improved by increasing the distance between the source and the grating .",
    ", one observes partial recurrences of the intensity distribution in the slits , while at greater distances the main diffraction orders of far - field interference start to emerge .",
    "the calculation is done in the paraxial approximation , assuming ideal gratings with a slit width of half the slit separation .",
    "note that the axes are not to scale .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +      many textbooks on classical optics restrict themselves to far - field interference pattern described by the fourier - transform of the diffraction mask .",
    "also the first diffraction experiments with c@xmath7 fullerenes were performed in this regime : an effusive molecular beam with a velocity of about @xmath8 m/s was sent onto a nanomechanical grating with a slit separation of @xmath9 nm @xcite . given the de broglie wavelength of 5 pm",
    ", sufficient transverse coherence could only be prepared by reducing the effective source width to smaller than @xmath10 m . since the first order interference fringes were separated by only @xmath11 m at a distance of 1 m behind the grating , a second @xmath10 m slit was placed immediately in front of the grating to collimate the beam width to smaller than the diffraction angle .",
    "this concept clearly worked , but at the expense of reducing the detected particle flux by many orders of magnitude .",
    "experiments with more massive species must cope with even smaller de broglie wavelengths and even stricter coherence requirements .",
    "several strategies are conceivable to fulfill them .",
    "bright colors indicate large wave amplitudes . at integer multiples of the talbot length",
    "@xmath12 it displays an exact image of the intensity distribution in the grating ( shifted by half a grating period for odd multiples ) . to highlight the fractional recurrences at rational multiples of @xmath13 the calculation was done ( in paraxial approximation ) with a small slit width of 15% of the grating period .",
    "the talbot - lau interferometers described below are based on the same resonant interference effect which gives rise to these structures .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    novel source methods may serve to improve the coherence and to increase @xmath1 .",
    "however , slowing of the particle beam alone does not solve the problem , since it reduces only the forward velocity and therefore increases the beam divergence by the same factor .",
    "genuine cooling would reduce the mean velocity , the velocity spread in all directions , and eventually also the number of internal excitations . but cooling schemes for interferometry with very massive particles are still in an early development stage ( see sect .  [ experimentalchallenges ] ) . improved detectors with true single - particle sensitivity may allow one to compensate for the tiny fluxes associated with a tight collimation .",
    "we focus here on a third aspect , the implementations of novel near - field interferometer schemes which relax the coherence requirements and at the same time parallelize the diffraction effect thousandfold .    coherent diffraction at an arbitrary aperture",
    "is generally described by the kirchhoff - fresnel integral @xcite .",
    "it can be viewed as a decomposition of the diffraction pattern into spherical waves emanating from all points in the aperture surface .",
    "each contributes a phase @xmath14 with @xmath15 the distance between an aperture point and an image point on a screen .",
    "the paraxial approximation holds if the latter is located at a distance @xmath5 large compared to the extension of the aperture .",
    "the contributing phases can then be expanded to second order in the lateral coordinates of aperture and screen , @xmath16 .",
    "one can further distinguish between far - field and near - field interference based on the importance of the propagating wavefront curvature in @xmath17 @xcite . in the fraunhofer , or far - field approximation the quadratic terms @xmath18 and @xmath19 may be neglected in @xmath17 , while they are required for fresnel , or near - field diffraction .",
    "figure [ fig : near - far ] shows the transition from the near - field to first features of the far - field regime for diffraction at a grating of ten slits .",
    "the proper far - field limit is then reached at the characteristic distance @xmath20 , where the wave pattern is already expanded to well beyond the size of the aperture @xmath4 , so that spherical waves can already be locally approximated as plane waves .",
    "our near - field interferometers are based on the principle of _ coherent lensless self - imaging_. this concept was first developed for light optics @xcite and it is nowadays often employed in situations where refractive optical elements are unavailable , such as with molecules @xcite or x - rays @xcite .",
    "the effect , which can already be recognized in the near - field region of fig .",
    "[ fig : near - far ] , is illustrated in its idealized form in fig .",
    "[ fig : talbotsimulation ] : when a monochromatic plane wave illuminates a wide grating of period @xmath2 , interference of all diffraction orders will reproduce a self - image of the intensity distribution in the mask , at the distance @xmath21 further downstream .",
    "the talbot length @xmath22 is named after henry fox talbot who discovered the effect with light @xcite .",
    "self - imaging recurs at integer multiples of @xmath22 up to the point where diffraction at the edges of the grating window becomes relevant . at odd multiples of @xmath22 the grating image",
    "is shifted by half a fringe period , while it appears unshifted at even multiples ; some authors therefore prefer to define @xmath23 as the talbot length .",
    "figure  [ fig : talbotsimulation ] also reveals fractional revivals with smaller periods in distances which are rational fractions of @xmath22 .",
    "the observed intensity distribution is a beautiful example of wave physics and clearly incompatible with the assumption of ray optics @xcite .",
    "prepares the required spatial coherence , g@xmath24 diffracts the wavelets so that they will form an interferogram , and g@xmath25 is scanned to sample the fringe pattern @xcite .",
    "b ) the _ kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau interferometer ( kdtli ) _ eliminates the dispersive van der waals interactions between the molecules and the grating walls inside the tli , since the central diffraction element is realized as an off - resonant standing light wave @xcite .",
    "c ) an _ optical time - domain ionizing matter ( otima ) interferometer _ , which has yet to be realized , consists of three ultraviolet laser beams .",
    "single - photon ionization in the anti - nodes of the standing wave removes clusters from the incident particle cloud , acting similarly as the massive bars of a material grating .",
    "operated in the time - domain and using short and precisely timed laser pulses , the otima concept avoids many phase averaging effects @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +      the implementation of the talbot effect still requires a high degree of coherence and has so far been observed with atoms @xcite and electrons @xcite but not yet with molecules .",
    "we can extend this concept to spatially incoherent sources by adding a second grating of the same period .",
    "this leads to the configuration of array illuminators which was proposed by @xcite and is nowadays widely used in light optics @xcite .",
    "the intuitive picture behind this scheme is the following : the first grating g@xmath26 acts as a periodic spatial mask which prepares transverse coherence by slicing the incident wave field into numerous wavelets .",
    "there is no phase coherence between the waves emerging from neighboring slits .",
    "however , each of the individual wavelets emanating from any of the slits of g@xmath27 develops sufficient transverse coherence on its way towards the second grating g@xmath24 to cover two or more slits with a well - defined phase relation .",
    "this requires g@xmath3 to be at a distance comparable to @xmath28 away from g@xmath27 . diffraction at the second grating followed by the free evolution over the talbot distance then leads to the formation of a spatially periodic intensity pattern whose period equals that of the two gratings .",
    "this way , each slit in g@xmath26 gives rise to a fringe pattern at the detection screen .",
    "all interferograms associated with the individual source slits are synchronized in their phase position such that they add up to a high contrast density pattern .",
    "a formal treatment shows that the fringe visibility may actually have a minimum when the grating distance matches exactly the talbot length @xcite , but it reaches a maximum in the close vicinity of @xmath22 .",
    "a direct way to visualize the final molecular density pattern is to capture and image the molecules on a clean surface @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may scan the interferogram with a third grating g@xmath29 of the same period @xcite . in this case",
    "the spatial resolution is provided by the grating , so that the integration over a large area leads to a significant gain in signal and a reduction of the measurement time .",
    "this is of particular advantage for sources with a small flux and limited coherence .",
    "it also provides a fast signal readout which is often required for feedback and alignment purposes .    in talbot - lau interferometry the required grating period @xmath30 is determined by the de broglie wavelength and the size of the interferometer @xmath5 , independently of the molecular beam width @xmath31 .",
    "this scaling is much less demanding than that of far - field diffraction , @xmath32 . in comparison to single - grating far - field diffraction",
    ", talbot - lau interferometry with three masks imposes more stringent alignment requirements since both the rotation and the longitudinal position of the gratings are important . on the other hand ,",
    "the arrangement of thousands of parallel slits increases the signal by several orders of magnitude over far - field experiments .",
    "both the short de broglie wavelength and the limited coherence of available molecular beam sources are the reasons why interferometry with large molecules only started off with the advent of near - field interferometers .",
    "the concept was first demonstrated for potassium atoms by @xcite and it was further explored in a number of theoretical papers @xcite .",
    "macromolecule interferometry was then realized in the following steps .",
    "the first fullerene interferometer was implemented in a talbot - lau ( tl ) configuration with three microfabricated gold gratings , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ interferometers]a .",

    "dash - dotted line : classical shadow contrast in the presence of van der waals forces .",
    "all theoretical curves include an average over the measured velocity distribution in the beam .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] +    in this interferometer arrangement , high - contrast interference could be observed both for the fullerenes by @xcite and for the biodye tetraphenylporphyrin ( tpp ) by @xcite . in fig .",

    ", we define the fringe visibility of a sine wave pattern as the ratio of its amplitude over its offset .",
    "in contrast to far - field diffraction , which is an unambiguous wave phenomenon without any ray optics analog , the appearance of molecular density fringes in a two - grating experiment might also be explained by a classical moir shadow , to a certain degree .",
    "fortunately , quantum diffraction and moir effects can be well distinguished by studying the fringe visibility as a function of the particle velocity , as done in fig .",
    "[ tlic70interference ] .",
    "if molecules were classical particles travelling along straight trajectories , their velocity would not influence the moir visibility .",
    "they should , therefore , all exhibit a visibility of only @xmath37% in our settings .",
    "in contrast to that , the de broglie wavelength of a quantum object is inversely proportional to its velocity and we expect a periodic recurrence of the fringe visibility with the velocity .    interestingly , this idealized quantum wave picture ( dotted line in fig .  [ tlic70interference ] ) does not reproduce the fullerene interference experiment at all ( black circles ) , since it ignores the van der waals interaction of the polarizable molecule with the grating walls .",
    "although the effect of grating interactions was already observed in far - field diffraction at thin sin masks @xcite , it becomes much more dominant in near - field interference , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ theory ] .",
    "the c@xmath34 experiment can be much better described by a quantum model that includes the van der waals attraction as in fig .",
    "[ tlic70interference ] .",

    "the exact potential according to @xcite leads to a curve very close to that of the non - retarded form in the present case .",
    "an explanation of the remaining discrepancy between experiment and theory requires future experiments with gratings of variable thickness and different materials , as well as better velocity selection .",
    "we note that also the classical treatment must include the attractive force in the grating slit .",
    "the expected visibility then follows a monotonic curve in the same diagram ( dash - dotted line in fig .  [ tlic70interference ] ) , but",
    "never exceeds 16% in our setting .",
    "this is clearly different from both the quantum description and the experimental observation .",
    "the polarizability of a mesoscopic particle is roughly proportional to its volume .",
    "therefore casimir - polder forces have an even more significant effect on larger particles .",
    "this explains why in a talbot - lau interferometer with material gratings quantum interference may be difficult to observe for more massive particles , unless we are either able to prepare a sufficiently intense molecular beam with a narrow velocity spread below 1% or to fabricate an atomically thin diffraction mask , for instance from graphene @xcite .",

    "the problem of van der waals forces can be eliminated by another interferometer scheme : following the demonstration of an optical phase grating for fullerenes by @xcite a new interferometer was proposed by @xcite and implemented by @xcite .",
    "this ` kapitza - dirac - talbot - lau ' interferometer ( kdtli ) combines the idea of talbot - lau ( tli ) near - field parallelization with the concept of matter diffraction at a standing light wave as originally proposed by @xcite for electrons and first realized with atoms by @xcite in the bragg regime .",
    "+    the kdtli evolves from a tli if we replace the central diffraction grating g@xmath24 by a standing laser light wave with the same grating period , see fig .",
    "[ interferometers ] .",
    "we still keep the mechanical masks g@xmath26 and g@xmath25 for coherence preparation and interference imaging .",
    "the van der waals phases at these stages do not perturb the final pattern since g@xmath26 and g@xmath25 act only as spatially periodic transmission filters ( each thinning out the beam by about two thirds ) .",
    "the new optical phase grating g@xmath24 does not remove any particles from the beam .",
    "instead , the electric laser field @xmath44 interacts with the molecular optical polarizability @xmath45 to induce a rapidly oscillating electric dipole moment which interacts again with the laser field . in a standing light wave , the resulting dipole potential @xmath46 is spatially modulated , and so is the imprinted molecular phase .",
    "given that its period is the same as that of g@xmath26 , the free evolution of the de broglie waves behind the grating then results in an observable molecular fringe pattern with the same periodicity . as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : kdtlivdependence ] , the elimination of the molecule - wall - interaction at g@xmath24 significantly reduces the monochromaticity requirement on the incident matter waves .    in our experiment the optical phase grating is realized by retro - reflecting a 532 nm laser of up to 18w at a flat mirror . since the incident molecular beam has a divergence of about 1mrad it is important to orient the standing light wave such that no semiclassical molecular trajectory crosses more than a single node or anti - node of the green light - field . in order to meet this condition the laser",

    "the relatively large error bars in this experiment are due to the short measurement time resulting from the thermal instability of the species and from the fact that they are available only in small amounts .",
    "although kdtl interferometry is compatible with high molecular masses , van der waals forces in g@xmath26 and g@xmath25 may eventually lead to a blockage of the grating due to adsorbed molecules clogging the slits .",
    "it is therefore useful to consider an all - optical setup , such as the optical time - domain ionizing matter ( otima ) interferometer we describe below .",
    "as long as we are limited to incoherent sources , the first grating must act as an absorptive mask to prepare the required spatial coherence .",
    "optical amplitude gratings were already realized by @xcite for metastable atoms by inducing transitions to undetected states .",
    "since the high level density in clusters and molecules usually precludes this resonant excitation scheme , @xcite proposed photo - ionization gratings as a universal tool for complex nanoparticles , where a single photon suffices to ionize and remove the particles from the antinodes of a standing light wave .",
    "the intensity maxima thus play the role of the grating bars , but their transmission , periodicity , and the additionally imprinted phase can be tuned by varying the pulse energy and the laser wavelength . in variance to the tli and kdtli design , the second pulse g@xmath24 acts as a combination of both an absorptive and a phase grating .",

    "this distinction of states with well - defined position can be explained within the framework of quantum mechanics by the concept of environmental decoherence @xcite .",

    "this is implied by the fact that , unlike in a bec , the de broglie wavelength is given by the mass of the whole object .",
    "our experiments are also complementary to proposals for using mechanical oscillators to test the limits of the quantum superposition principle @xcite .",
    "mechanical devices are orders of magnitude more massive than even the largest clusters conceivable in foreseeable matter wave experiments",
    ". however , the high cantilever mass limits the maximal spatial separation between two superposed center - of - mass wave packets",
    ". it will remain many orders of magnitude smaller than the separation routinely achieved in molecule interferometry .",
    "bose - einstein condensation , interferometry with nanoparticles , and quantum studies with nanomechanical oscillators are therefore truly complementary approaches to investigate the nature of macroscopic quantum physics .",
    "we are indebted to many students , postdocs and collaborators in vienna over many years .",
    "special thanks go to anton zeilinger for initiating and stimulating the research program on macromolecule interferometry and for continuous encouragement along the way over many years .",
    "we thank marcel mayor and jens txen , university of basel , for the synthesis and characterization of many molecules described in this work .",
    "we acknowledge financial support through the austrian fwf wittgenstein grant ( z149-n16 ) and coqus ( c33n16 ) , as well as the esf euroquasar project mime ( i146-n16 ) .",
