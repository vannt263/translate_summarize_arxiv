    "researchers in mathematics and physics have extensively investigated spectral and quantum dynamical characteristics of one - dimensional hamiltonians of the form @xmath0_n = \\psi_{n-1 } + v_n \\psi_n + \\psi_{n+1 } , \\quad n \\in { { \\mathbbm z } } , \\ ; \\psi \\in \\ell^2({{\\mathbbm z}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a bounded sequence , known as the _",
    "potential_. the most heavily - studied models are those for which @xmath2 is periodic , almost - periodic , or random .",
    "almost - periodic operators can exhibit wild spectral characteristics , such as cantor spectrum of zero lebesgue measure and purely singular continuous spectral type .",
    "the literature on such operators is vast ; see @xcite and references therein . though such phenomena were once thought to be exotic and rare , cantor spectrum and purely singular continuous spectral type turn out to be generic in a rather robust sense for many families of one - dimensional operators having the form   @xcite . the more complicated structure of higher - dimensional analogs of makes such models prohibitively difficult to study , even in simple cases . with some notable exceptions ( see ,",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , spectral properties of aperiodic almost - periodic schrdinger operators in higher dimensions have proved quite difficult to study .",
    "recently some success has been achieved by studying operators that are separable , in the sense that they can be separated into a sum of two commuting one - dimensional operators ; such separable operators are amenable to attack , as their spectra can be expressed as the sum of the spectra of their one - dimensional components , which are well - understood .",
    "even in this situation , one must deal with delicate challenges , such as arithmetic sums of cantor sets and convolutions of singular measures .",
    "initial insight about these operators and their spectra came from numerical studies , mainly appearing in the physics literature @xcite .",
    "rigorous results have been obtained fairly recently in @xcite .",
    "the present paper addresses discrete two - dimensional schrdinger operators on a square lattice , defined by @xmath3_{n , m } = v_{n , m}\\psi_{n , m } \\\\ [ \\delta\\psi]_{n , m } = \\psi_{n-1,m } + \\psi_{n+1,m } & + \\psi_{n , m-1 } + \\psi_{n , m+1 } , \\\\",

    "with @xmath5 when holds for some @xmath6 , we say @xmath2 is @xmath7-_periodic_. the study of schrdinger operators on @xmath8 ( and more generally on @xmath8-periodic lattices ) is of interest due to applications in chemistry and physics ; see the survey @xcite for instance .",
    "many papers and books have been written about operators on graphs ; see @xcite and references therein .",
    "our main result shows that the spectra of such objects are quite different from those of operators like .",
    "concretely , we prove that any periodic potential in dimension two that is sufficiently small will produce a spectrum with at most two connected components if @xmath9 and @xmath10 are both even , and with one connected component otherwise .",
    "this result contrasts strongly with the one - dimensional case , in which a generic @xmath9-periodic operator has spectrum with @xmath9 connected components .",
    "[ t : discretebsconj ] let @xmath11 be given . there exists a constant @xmath12 such that the following statements hold true :    1 .",

    "if at least one of @xmath9 or @xmath10 is odd , then @xmath14 is a single interval whenever @xmath2 is @xmath7-periodic and @xmath13 .",
    "this result can be regarded as a discrete version of the bethe ",
    "sommerfeld conjecture ( in dimension two ) , which posits that the spectrum of the operator @xmath15 acting in @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) contains a half - line whenever @xmath2 is periodic in the sense that there exists a rank-@xmath18 lattice @xmath19 such that @xmath20 in particular , the analysis of the discrete operator @xmath21 with @xmath22 small mirrors that of the high - energy regime of the ( unbounded ) operator @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "the bethe ",
    "sommerfeld conjecture has inspired intense study , with substantial contributions from many authors , including ( but certainly not limited to ) @xcite , and culminating in the paper of parnovskii @xcite .",
    "however , our proof techniques here are a bit different than those used in the continuum setting .",
    "in particular , we employ a pair of soft arguments : one to count eigenvalues , and one to prove that the eigenvalue counts forbid small potentials from opening gaps at nonzero energies .",
    "these soft arguments must be refined on a finite exceptional set using perturbation theory for degenerate eigenvalues , showing that gaps can not form at such energies .    on the discrete side , krger proved part ( 2 ) of theorem  [ t : discretebsconj ] under the more restrictive assumption @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "he also constructed examples with @xmath24 for which @xmath25 contains two intervals for arbitrarily small @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , with @xmath26 he shows that @xmath27 .",
    "thus , our result improves the result of @xcite to incorporate the optimal range of validity vis -  - vis arithmetic conditions on @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , our proof is substantially simpler than krger s proof of ( * ? ? ? * theorem  6.1 ) , as he uses some sophisticated algebraic tools ( cf .",
    "* section  5 ) ) . finally , in the course of the proof , we answer questions  6.2 and  6.4 in @xcite .",
    "question  6.2 asks for optimal conditions on @xmath9 and @xmath10 so that the conclusion of part  2 of theorem  [ t : discretebsconj ] holds ; we prove that @xmath28 odd suffices .",
    "question  6.4 asks whether there exists another mechanism by which one may open gaps in higher dimensions at small coupling ; our arguments answer this question in the negative .",
    "one immediate consequence of theorem  [ t : discretebsconj ] is that it is much more difficult to produce cantor spectrum in high dimensions .",
    "for example , theorem  [ t : discretebsconj ] immediately implies that if a sequence of periodic potentials converges sufficiently rapidly , then the spectrum of the resulting limit - periodic operator can have at most two connected components .",
    "again , this draws a strong contrast with one - dimensional limit - periodic operators , which generically exhibit zero - measure cantor spectrum @xcite .",

    "we now turn to constructing @xmath249 and @xmath251 .",
    "as before , if @xmath269 , there is nothing to do , so assume @xmath270 . moreover , if @xmath271 , then the argument from the @xmath203 case just studied carries over verbatim , so we may take @xmath272 for small @xmath266 .",

    "it remains to deal with the case when @xmath273 , so let such an @xmath187 with @xmath274 be given .",
    "again , the multiplicity of @xmath187 as an eigenvalue of @xmath143 is @xmath275 for some @xmath276 by lemma  [ lem:2deigmults ] .",
    "this case is the most delicate because one has to find a perturbative argument that simultaneously works for three types of pairs of eigenvalues of @xmath277 that sum to @xmath187 .",
    "it turns out that we can take @xmath278 for @xmath279 sufficiently small .",
    "let us describe how this comes about .",
    "first , notice that @xmath280 implies that there exists an integer @xmath281 with @xmath282 .",
    "fix @xmath283 small ; we will describe how small @xmath284 must be presently . in view of proposition",
    "[ p:1dlaplacianeigmults ] and lemma  [ lem : cornerderivatives ] , we deduce @xmath285 if @xmath286 for small @xmath266 .",
    "we must address the possibility that this @xmath280 can also be expressed as the sum of pairs of doubly degenerate eigenvalues , i.e. , that there exist positive integers @xmath287 and @xmath288 for which @xmath289 if @xmath290 , then , since @xmath180 , we may assume without loss that @xmath291 .",
    "lemma  [ lem : cornerderivatives](c ) then implies that @xmath292 now take some @xmath284 such that @xmath293 again take @xmath286 with @xmath266 sufficiently small",
    ". then lemma  [ lem : cornerderivatives](b ) gives @xmath294 notice that this particular choice of @xmath284 is required to ensure the inequalities and hold .",
    "thus , we ultimately take @xmath283 with @xmath295 where the minimum ranges over all pairs with @xmath296 and @xmath291 . on the other hand , when @xmath297 , then  still hold for @xmath286 , as long as @xmath298 is sufficiently small .",

    "in particular , implies that @xmath306 .",
    "proposition  [ p:1dlaplacianeigmults ] also shows that all the eigenvalues of @xmath307 are simple and the spectrum is symmetric about zero : @xmath308    to show that zero is in the interior of a band , we will compute the multiplicity of @xmath70 as an eigenvalue of @xmath309 , and then use lemma  [ lem : cornerderivatives ] to understand how this eigenvalue splits as we perturb around @xmath310 ( leaving @xmath311 fixed ) .",
    "now , let us make some observations . first , since the spectrum of @xmath312 is also symmetric about zero ( see proposition  [ p:1dlaplacianeigmults ] ) , if @xmath313",
    ", then there is no @xmath314 with @xmath315 on the other hand , for any @xmath31 such that @xmath316 , there exists @xmath317 such that @xmath318 by symmetry , @xmath319 of course , the pairs in and are distinct whenever @xmath320 .",
    "finally , we have from  ( [ eq : sum0 ] ) that @xmath167 can emerge as an eigenvalue in one additional way : @xmath321 taken together , these observations imply that the multiplicity of zero as an eigenvalue of @xmath309 is congruent to two modulo four , say @xmath322 for integers @xmath323 .",
    "since @xmath9 is odd , it is congruent to one of @xmath324 modulo four .",
    "the two cases are very similar , so let us assume @xmath325 . then , by lemma",
    "[ lem : cornerderivatives ] , @xmath326 and so @xmath327 for @xmath299 small .",
    "additionally , since @xmath9 is odd , we notice that @xmath328 and @xmath329 have the same parity for all @xmath31 .",
    "consequently , lemma  [ lem : cornerderivatives ] implies that the derivatives of @xmath330 and @xmath331 have the same sign ( and both derivatives are nonzero when evaluated at @xmath310 ) .",
    "thus , for each pair @xmath332 for which @xmath333 and and hold , we get a quartet of eigenvalues of @xmath309 that all cross zero in the same direction as @xmath67 crosses @xmath334 . combining this observation with ,",
    "we get integers @xmath335 so that @xmath336 for small @xmath299 . in particular , the arguments above imply that @xmath337 is divisible by four and @xmath338 is congruent to two modulo four .",
    "hence , with @xmath339 , we may argue as before to see that @xmath70 is in the interior of at least one of @xmath340 , @xmath341 , @xmath342 , or @xmath343 .",
    "figure  [ fig : quilt_odd0 ] gives two specific examples of the scenario treated in proposition  [ prop : nogap : zero ] .",

    "given @xmath11 with @xmath9 odd , one can run the argument above by perturbing around @xmath355 when @xmath356 and perturbing around @xmath357 when @xmath10 is odd , which obviates the need to alter the vertical period .",
