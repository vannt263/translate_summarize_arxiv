    "any successful cosmological model must account for the quantity , distribution , and physical state of the baryons in the universe .",
    "while this is likely a more tractable challenge than understanding the more exotic non - baryonic dark matter and dark energy ( i.e. , the cosmological constant ) , there is a `` missing baryon problem '' which has been known for some time . in brief ,",
    "inventories of the well - observed baryons in the nearby universe ( including stars , cool neutral gas , and x - ray emitting galaxy cluster gas ) find total baryon densities , in units of the closure density , of @xmath16 0.006 ( assuming @xmath17 = 75@xmath18 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath19 , see , e.g. , persic & salucci 1992 ; fukugita et al .",
    "this is far less than the expected value based on big bang nucleosynthesis and deuterium measurements ( burles & tytler 1998 ) : @xmath20 = 0.019@xmath210.001 ( = 0.034@xmath210.002 for @xmath22 = 0.75 ) .",
    "ironically , the baryons have been more readily accounted for in the distant universe than in the low@xmath23 universe : at high redshifts , the `` ly@xmath3  forest ''  photoionized , diffuse intergalactic gas at @xmath24 k  appears to contain the vast majority of the baryons predicted by the deuterium observations ( rauch et al . 1997",
    "; weinberg et al . 1997 ) . at low redshifts ,",
    "the cool ly@xmath3  forest is less dominant but still makes a substantial contribution to the baryon inventory .",
    "however , even including recent estimates of the baryonic content of the low@xmath25z ly@xmath3 forest ( shull , stocke , & penton 1996 ; penton , shull , & stocke 2000 ) , the census of baryons at the present epoch falls well short of the expected @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , cosmologists are confronted with an important question : where are the missing baryons at the present epoch ?    a promising possible answer to this question has been provided by cosmological simulations of the growth of large scale structure . according to hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation , at the present epoch 30@xmath2550% of the baryons ( by mass )",
    "are located in low - density , intergalactic gas which has been shock - heated to @xmath27 k ( cen & ostriker 1999a ; dav et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .",
    "following cen & ostriker , we refer to this @xmath27 k gas as the warm / hot intergalactic medium to distinguish it from the hotter gas observed in rich galaxy clusters .",
    "such gas is challenging to observe .",
    "its x - ray emission is extremely difficult to detect , especially at lower energies where confusion due to foreground emission and absorption is substantial .",
    "current x - ray observations do not exclude this hot igm baryon reservoir ( kuntz , snowden , & mushotzky 2001 ; phillips , ostriker , & cen 2001 ) , and there are some indications of large - scale filaments of diffuse gas delineated by x - ray emission ( e.g. , scharf et al . 2000 ; rines et al .",
    ". however , voit , evrard , & bryan ( 2001 ) and croft et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish between x - ray emission from diffuse intergalactic gas outside of virialized structures ( as predicted by the cosmological simulations ) and x - ray emission from virialized groups and clusters .",
    "the gas may be a significant baryon repository in either case , but the distinction has important physical implications , e.g. , regarding the relative importance of gravitational vs. nongravitational heating processes .",
    "qso absorption lines provide an alternative means to test the prediction that a significant quantity of baryons are in the warm / hot igm . absorption lines such as the @xmath281031.9,1037.6 and @xmath28",
    "770.4,780.3 doublets provide sensitive probes of @xmath29 k gas in collisional ionization equilibrium ( verner , tytler , & barthel 1994 ) . searches for the absorption lines at @xmath1@xmath30 0.3 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ have revealed that the number of intervening absorbers per unit redshift ( @xmath31 ) is remarkably high ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 ; tripp & savage 2000 ) .",
    "furthermore , with reasonable assumptions about the metallicity and ionization of the gas , these studies have shown that absorption systems are probably an important baryon reservoir .",
    "since the ion fraction peaks at @xmath32 k in collisional ionization equilibrium , these absorption studies provide tantalizing evidence that the warm / hot igm is an important baryon repository at @xmath33",
    ". however , there are several issues which must be addressed in order to build a compelling case .",
    "first , the number of systems ( and sight lines ) in the published stis observations is rather small , and consequently quantities such as @xmath31 and the cosmological mass density have large uncertainties .",
    "more observations are needed , and new programs to build the sample are underway .",
    "second , the lines could arise in gas which is not collisionally ionized , but rather is photoionized by the uv background from qsos and active galaxies . or , the gas could be collisionally ionized but out of equilibrium , e.g. , because it is able to cool more rapidly than it can recombine .",
    "photo- or non - equilibrium ionization is favored in some of the systems because they have narrow associated lines ( e.g. , tripp & savage 2000 ; savage et al .",
    "2001 ) which would not arise in equilibrium collisional ionization . alternatively , these could be multiphase absorbers . of course , in some cases",
    "photoionization and collisional ionization could be comparably important .",
    "if the gas is photoionized , then there are concerns about double - counting in the baryon inventory ( see below ) .",
    "third , the metallicity of the absorbers is poorly constrained . if these systems originate in pockets of high metallicity gas , then there is less hydrogen associated with the absorbers and their baryonic content is lower [ @xmath34 ( ) @xmath35 ( o / h)@xmath5 ] .",
    "finally , the environment in which these absorbers are located must be scrutinized .",
    "are these absorbers found in unvirialized galaxy filaments or even galaxy voids , or do they arise in virialized structures ?",
    "are these systems due to gas which is gravitationally shock - heated when gas accretes onto large - scale structures , or could they be heated by nongravitational processes such as supernova - driven winds ?    in this paper",
    "we are primarily interested in the ionization and metallicity of the gas .",
    "specifically , we use high - resolution uv spectra obtained with stis and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ to study the ionization and nature of a particular absorption system at @xmath1  = 0.1212 in the spectrum of the radio - quiet qso h1821 + 643 ( @xmath0  = 0.297 ) . while some absorbers are apparently `` intrinsic '' ( i.e. , close to the qso itself , see hamann & ferland 1999 ) , the h1821 + 643 absorber at @xmath1  = 0.1212 is certainly an intervening system : it is highly displaced from the qso redshift ( @xmath37 43,400 km s@xmath5 ) and is located at a redshift where there are several galaxies close to the line of sight , including a luminous galaxy at a projected distance of 144 @xmath2 kpc which shows [ ] , [ ] , and h@xmath38 emission lines indicative of active star formation ( tripp , lu , & savage 1998 ; bowen , pettini , & boyle 1998 ) .",
    "the ionization mechanism is a crucial issue because if the absorbers are photoionized and cool rather than collisionally ionized and hot , then they still represent a substantial baryon reservoir ( see tripp & savage 2000 ) , but in this case they may reveal the same baryons counted in ly@xmath3  studies such as penton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) [ note that all intervening systems that we have detected so far are also detected in the ly@xmath3  transition ] .",
    "apart from the baryon census , the metallicity and physical conditions of the gas are interesting in their own right .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the stis and _ fuse _ observations and data reduction are described in  2 .",
    "section 3 summarizes the absorption line measurement techniques .",
    "constraints are placed on the physical conditions and metallicity of the gas in  4 including a comparison of the absorber properties required in collisionally ionized and photoionized scenarios and some comments on x - ray absorption lines of and .",
    "we discuss the results and summarize our conclusions in  5 . throughout this paper",

    "this stis mode uses the fuv mama detector , which generally has very low dark background counts . while this detector also has an amoebic region that shows elevated dark counts when the detector temperature increases ( see figure 1 in brown et al .",
    "2000 ) , the dark count rate was small compared to the source count rate for all of the observations employed here .",
    "the observations made use of the @xmath41 slit resulting in a line spread function with minimal wings ( see figure 13.87 in the stis instrument handbook , v4.1 ) .",

    "this first - order grating spectrum has a resolution of @xmath430 km s@xmath5  ( fwhm ) .",
    "the data were reduced with the stis team version of calstis at the goddard space flight center .",
    "the individual echelle spectra were flatfielded , extracted , and wavelength and flux calibrated with the standard techniques .",
    "then a correction for scattered light was applied using the method developed by bowers et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the individual spectra were combined weighted by their inverse variances averaged over a large , high s / n region .",
    "finally , overlapping regions of adjacent orders were also coadded weighted inversely by their variances .",

    "two 50-pixel wide regions centered 52 pixels away from the spectrum ( one on each side ) were used to determine the background .",
    "the two g230 m spectra were also combined with weighting based on signal- to - noise . to ensure that the wavelength scale of the g230 m spectrum is aligned with that of the e140 m echelle spectrum , the milky way @xmath451741.5 and @xmath451751.9 lines covered in the g230 m spectrum",

    "most wavelengths in the _ fuse _ bandpass are recorded by at least two channels ( see figure 3 in sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the initial ( 1999 ) observations were reduced as described in oegerle et al .",
    "the later observations were reduced in a similar fashion with calfuse version 1.7.6 .",
    "the data were recorded in time - tag mode and were processed to correct for doppler shifts due to orbital motion , subtract backgrounds , and wavelength and flux calibrate the spectra .",
    "flatfield and astigmatism corrections were not sufficiently tested at the time of processing and were not applied .",
    "calfuse assumes that the background is uniform across a given detector , which is an adequate approximation for an object as bright as h1821 + 643 .",
    "oegerle et al .",

    "the resolution depends on the wavelength and channel used to record the data .",
    "because of the varying resolution of data from different channels and observation dates , there are differing views on how to best make use of multiple detections of a particular line .",
    "we discuss our strategy regarding this issue in  3 .    while the wavelength scale of the 1999 october data can show large errors ( 10 - 30 km s@xmath5 ) over small intervals , this problem was subsequently corrected and is not evident in the 2000 july data .",
    "the relative dispersion solution of the 2000 july data is accurate to @xmath46 km s@xmath5 .",

    "to set the zero point of the _ fuse _ data , the multicomponent milky way @xmath451144.9 line was compared to the galactic 1608.5 line recorded in the stis e140 m spectrum .",
    "similarly , lyman series lines in the _ fuse _ spectrum at @xmath1  = 0.225 , which show distinctive component structure , were compared to the ly@xmath47 line at this redshift in the stis spectrum . as in oegerle et al .",

    "the stis data are optimally sampled , so no rebinning has been applied .",
    "remarkably , despite the close proximity of several galaxies ( see  1 ) and a relatively strong ly@xmath3 line , only ly@xmath3 , ly@xmath38 , and the @xmath451032 transitions are clearly detected at the 4@xmath48 level or better at this redshift ( we argue below that there is evidence of @xmath451038 absorption as well , although the transition is blended with an unrelated line ) .",

    "first , the ly@xmath38 profile shows excess absorption compared to the model profile over several pixels at @xmath57 90 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this is due to noise .",
    "since the ly@xmath3  @xmath58value is a factor of 5 greater than the ly@xmath38  @xmath59value , and since the equivalent width goes as @xmath60 , this `` component '' would be very prominent in the ly@xmath3   profile if it were real .",
    "we have attempted to find a set of components which produce this extra ly@xmath38  absorption without violating the constraints set by the ly@xmath3  profile , and we have been unsuccessful . since _",
    "fuse _ is known to have complex and substantial fixed - pattern noise ( sahnow et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is not too surprising to occasionally encounter a noise feature of this sort .",
    "second , the model profile fitted to the lines is not unique .",
    "the smoothness of the ly@xmath3  profile at @xmath61 km s@xmath5  provides some support for fitting this wing with a single broad component , but a comparably good fit can be obtained with several narrower components spread over this velocity range .    in the case of the _ fuse _ data ,",
    "we are primarily interested in _ total _ equivalent widths and column densities integrated across the full velocity range of the main absorption feature ( i.e. , @xmath62 km s@xmath5  in figure  [ stack ] ) . given the breadth of the absorption features of interest and the moderate differences in resolution of the various data , it is reasonable to coadd the various spectra to increase the s / n .",
    "nevertheless , to be conservative we have measured integrated equivalent widths and apparent column densities from the individual spectra separately , then we have determined the mean of the individual measurements , each weighted inversely by its variance .",
    "these weighted means are the final integrated quantities reported in table  [ lineprop ] . for profile",
    "fitting , on the other hand , we fitted the stis ly@xmath3  and _ fuse _",
    "ly@xmath38 profiles simultaneously .",
    "consequently , to make full use of the _ fuse _ observations , we first coadded ly@xmath38 profiles with the usual weighting based on the inverse variances of the individual spectra .",
    "we similarly coadded the _ fuse _ data for the purposes of the next paragraph .",
    "note that figure  [ stack ] shows these coadded ly@xmath38 and profiles .",
    "since the ly@xmath38 lines are detected at high significance in the individual spectra , we elected to coadd only the ly@xmath38 profiles from the two lif channels obtained in 2000 july and thereby preserve the resolution as much as possible .",
    "however , the lines are detected at lower significance in the individual channels , and one of the lif channels from 2000 july is not useful in the region due to the vertical stray light stripe caused by scattered terrestrial ly@xmath3  emission during spacecraft orbital daytime ( see  2.3 in sahnow et al .",
    "consequently , for the lines we have coadded both of the lif channels from the 1999 observations with the one useful lif channel ( lif2 ) from the 2000 observations .",
    "we note hat the measurements from the individual channels are consistent within their 1@xmath48 uncertainties .",
    "since has a resonance - line doublet , its absorption lines can usually be unambiguously identified .",
    "unfortunately , the weaker 1038   line of the doublet at @xmath1  = 0.1212 in the spectrum of h1821 + 643 is strongly blended with the ly@xmath63 line from the absorption system at @xmath1  = 0.225 , which may lead some readers to question the reliability of the identification of the stronger @xmath451032 line shown in figure  [ stack ] . however , since the ly@xmath63 line is not strongly saturated , we should be able to demonstrate that the 1038   line is present if the s / n is sufficient , and indeed we do find evidence of the 1038    line at the expected wavelength and strength .",
    "figure  [ oviblend ] shows this evidence .",
    "this figure shows the continuum - normalized , coadded profiles .",
    "a single - component fit to the @xmath451032 line _ only _ is shown with a dashed line overplotted on the 1032   profile ( upper histogram ) .",
    "the velocity , column density , and doppler parameter from this fit predict a 1038   absorption line shown with a dashed line shown overplotted on the lower histogram in figure  [ oviblend ] .",
    "absorption is clearly present in the lower profile at the expected velocity with the expected strength .",
    "this gives us confidence that the identification is correct .",
    "in this section we explore the implications of the absorption - line measurements regarding the ionization and metallicity of the gas .",
    "we first consider collisional ionization , and then we examine photoionization . before assessing the ionization mechanism , we comment on several interesting features of this absorber :    1 .",
    "the absorption occurs at a redshift where there is a cluster of ly@xmath3  absorption lines ; at least five ly@xmath3  lines are present within a velocity interval of @xmath4700 km s@xmath5  ( see figures [ stack ] and [ lyagal ] ) .",
    "2 .   furthermore",
    ", there are several galaxies within @xmath21500 km s@xmath5  of this redshift with projected distances from the sight line ranging from 144 @xmath2 kpc to 3.1 mpc ( see tripp et al .",
    "figure  [ lyagal ] shows the velocities and projected distances of these galaxies with respect to the ly@xmath3  absorption lines [ tripp et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimate that the galaxy redshift uncertainties are @xmath64 km s@xmath5 ] .",
    "as noted in  1 , the closest galaxy has an emission line spectrum which suggests that it is actively forming stars .",
    "3 .   in addition to an ordinary , mildly saturated narrow line , the main ly@xmath3  profile appears to contain a relatively broad component at @xmath65 72 km s@xmath5  with @xmath7 85 km s@xmath5   ( see table 2 ; this broad component is shown with a heavy dashed line in figure  [ stack ] ) .",
    "this implies an upper limit on the temperature of the gas at this @xmath66 : @xmath67 k. therefore this absorption could arise in the warm / hot , shock - heated phase predicted by cosmological simulations .",
    "this is an upper limit because the profile could be broadened by factors other than thermal motions such as turbulence , multiple blended components , or expansion of the universe .",
    "if the broadening is predominantly due to cosmological expansion , then the implied pathlength @xmath12 through the absorber is given by @xmath68 km s@xmath5  ( @xmath12/200 kpc)@xmath18 .",
    "taking @xmath69 fwhm = 142 km s@xmath5  for the broad component , we obtain @xmath70 1.9 @xmath71 mpc in this case .",
    "the absorption is not aligned with the strongest portion of the profile ( i.e. , the saturated component at @xmath72 km s@xmath5 ) .",
    "rather , the is reasonably well - aligned with the broad component at @xmath65 72 km s@xmath5 . and",
    "o  vi centroids were offset but could not be sure of the magnitude of the offset because of problems with the wavelength scale in the early _ fuse _ data .",
    "these problems have been rectified , and the offset is now reliably determined . ]",
    "the line is also apparently broad ; the profile fit shown in figure  [ oviblend ] has @xmath73 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this would imply a high temperature if entirely due to thermal motions and may be evidence of another source of broadening ( see below ) .",

    "<S> we use high - resolution uv spectra of the radio - quiet qso h1821 + 643 ( @xmath0  = 0.297 ) , obtained with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) and the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) _ , to study the ionization and metallicity of an intervening absorption line system at @xmath1  = 0.1212 . </S>",
    "<S> this absorber has the following notable properties : ( 1 ) several galaxies are close to the sight line at the absorber redshift , including an actively star - forming galaxy at a projected distance of 144 @xmath2 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) there is a complex cluster of ly@xmath3  absorption lines near the redshift , including at least five components spread over a velocity range of @xmath4700 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) the strongest ly@xmath3  line in the cluster appears to be composed of a mildly saturated component with a typical @xmath6value blended with a remarkably broad component with @xmath7 85 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) the absorption is not aligned with the strongest ( saturated ) absorption , but instead is well - aligned with the very broad component . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) the only detected species ( at the @xmath8 level ) are and despite coverage of strong transitions of abundant elements ( e.g. , , , and ) . based on these constraints , we find that the absorption line properties can be produced in collisionally ionized gas with @xmath9 k and @xmath10 [ o / h ] @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that photoionization is also viable if the pathlength @xmath12 through the absorbing gas is long enough ; simple photoionization models require 85 @xmath13 1900 kpc and @xmath14 [ o / h ] @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss how observations of x - ray absorption lines due to and could be used , in principle , to break the ionization mechanism degeneracy , and we conclude with some comments regarding the nature of absorbers . </S>"
