    "recent advances have brought the astronomical community to the verge of discovering a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone ( hz ) of its parent star .",
    "classically , the hz is defined as the range of orbits for which a terrestrial mass planet ( @xmath10 ) , with favorable atmospheric conditions , can sustain liquid water on its surface @xcite .",
    "many giant planets have been discovered in the hz , and low - mass planets have been found very close to the hz ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , but no serious candidates for habitability have been found .",
    "recently @xcite used the harps spectrograph ( mayor et al 2003 ) to detect two planets around the nearby star hd 47186 : a hot neptune ( hd 47186 b ; @xmath11 ) with an orbital period of @xmath0 days and a saturn - mass planet ( hd 47186 c ; @xmath12 ) with a period of @xmath13 years .",
    "the orbital elements for this system are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "a curious characteristic of the host star hd 47186 is that its mass and luminosity are very similar to our own sun , albeit with higher metallicity ( table 1 . of @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the hz of this system may be similar to our own solar system s , and hence lies between the two known planets .",
    "@xcite found that the combined radial velocity ( rv ) amplitude for this system is @xmath14 m s@xmath15 with @xmath16 m s@xmath15 residuals and reduced @xmath17 .",
    "so potentially habitable planets may lie at or below the current rv detection threshold but may be discovered by further observations . here",
    "we perform @xmath3-body simulations to assess the stability of additional hypothetical planets within the hz of hd 47186 .",
    "the relatively small masses of the two known planets suggest an additional planet would likely also have low mass .",
    "masses less than @xmath6 are often considered the upper limit for terrestrial - like planets @xcite , hence an additional planet in the hz of this system might have a mass conducive to habitability .    as of feb 27 , 2009 ,",
    "290 extra - solar planetary systems are known including 37 multiplanet systems .",
    "@xcite found that many multiplanet systems tend to be close to the edge of stability such that slight perturbations to the system would result in destabilization @xcite .",
    "this observation led to the `` packed planetary systems ( pps ) '' hypothesis ( barnes & raymond 2004 ; raymond & barnes 2005 ; raymond 2006 ; barnes & greenberg 2007 ; see also laskar 1996 ) which postulates that if a region of stability is available in between two known planets , then that region will harbor an unseen planet ( in other words , planetary systems tend to be `` packed '' , with no large gaps between planets ) . to constrain the location of additional planets ,",
    "a large number of studies have mapped out stable zones in known extra - solar planetary systems , mainly using mass less test particles ( e.g. , rivera & lissauer 2000 ; jones et al 2001 ; menou & tabachnik 2003 ; dvorak et al 2003 ; barnes & raymond 2004 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of a saturn - mass planet in the narrow , well - characterized stable zone of hd 74156 @xcite .",
    "this constituted the first prediction of the orbit and mass of an extra - solar planet ( barnes et al .",
    "2008a ) .",
    "the pps model was further developed by the identification of an analytic stability boundary in two - planet systems @xcite .",
    "the boundary lies where the ratio of two quantities , @xmath18 , approximately equals unity . here",
    "@xmath19 depends on the total angular momentum and energy of the system and @xmath20 depends only on the masses @xcite .",
    "if @xmath21 ( and no resonances are present ) , then the system is stable .",
    "moreover , barnes et al .",
    "( 2008a ) found that systems tend to be packed if @xmath22 and not packed when @xmath23 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the vast majority of two - planet systems are observed with @xmath24 and hence are packed .",
    "our investigation into possible habitable planets in hd 47186 is further motivated by the large separation between the two known planets : the @xmath18 value for this system is @xmath25 , the largest value among known , non - controversial systems that have not been affected by tides .",
    "values for the known extra - solar multiple planet systems . ]",
    "this value is much higher than the packing limit , giving further support to the argument that at least one additional companion might exist between the two known planets .",
    "moreover , the success of @xmath3-body investigations in predicting the mass and orbit of additional planetary companions suggests a similar analysis on hd 47186 could yield similar results .",
    "but this time , the yet - to - be - detected planet could be habitable . in  [ sec2 ] we describe our numerical methods and map out stable regions for a hypothetical @xmath6 planet @xmath26 between the two known planets . following @xcite",
    ", we then investigate the perturbations of this hypothetical planet on the orbits of the known planets @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "this approach allows us to exclude a portion of parameter space that is dynamically stable but offers a low probability of detection . finally , in  [ sec3 ] we discuss our results .",
    "we started our simulations by assigning the two known planets from hd 47186 their best - fit orbits and masses from table 1 @xcite , and assuming mutual inclinations of 1 degree .",
    "we also included a hypothetical planet @xmath26 in between the orbits of planets @xmath4 and @xmath5 . from simulation to simulation , we varied planet @xmath26 s semi - major axis in the range @xmath27 au in steps of @xmath28 au and eccentricity in the range @xmath29 in steps of @xmath30 , for a total of 1483 simulations .",
    "we assigned planet @xmath26 a mass of @xmath31 , which would induce in the star a radial velocity amplitude of 3.5 - 0.6 m s@xmath15 in the range that we considered ( @xmath32 au ) .",
    "we evolved each system with the mercury @xcite integrator , using the symplectic wisdom - holman mapping ( wisdom & holman 1991 ) .",
    "each system was integrated with a time step of 1.0 day and conserved energy to better than 1 part in @xmath33 .",
    "simulations were stopped after @xmath34 myr or if there was a close encounter between any two planets of less than @xmath35 hill radii .",
    "previous work has shown that most unstable planetary systems undergo instabilities on a timescale of 1 myr or less ( e.g. , barnes & quinn 2004 ) .",
    "thus , our 10 myr integrations should be sufficient to give a realistic depiction of the stable zone .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the results of our simulations plotted in @xmath36@xmath37 space .",
    "the green and red filled circles represent stable and unstable simulations , respectively .",
    "the two known planets in hd 47186 are shown as blue filled circles , and the vertical bars represent the observational uncertainties in their eccentricities .",
    "the two curves overlaying the stable / unstable points are the crossing orbits for planets @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the blue shaded background is the `` eccentric habitable zone '' ( ehz ) for this system ( barnes et al 2008b ) .",
    "the ehz is defined as the hz from selsis et al ( 2007 ) , assuming @xmath38 cloud cover , and modified to take into account variations in the orbit - averaged flux with eccentricity , which appears to be the key factor in determining surface temperature ( williams & pollard 2002 ) .",
    "also labeled are some of the mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) between the hypothetical planet @xmath26 and outer massive planet @xmath5 . out of the 1483 simulations ,",
    "856 ( @xmath39 ) simulations were stable for 10 myr , and the stable zone includes the inner half of the ehz . within this stable zone ,",
    "several mmrs produce `` islands '' of instability associated with specific mmrs , notably @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "conversely , beyond the crossing orbit of planet c ( black dashed curve overlapping ehz ) , there are several mmrs , such as @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( not shown , but lies in between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) and @xmath45 that provide stability .",
    "this result is similar to that of raymond et al ( 2008 ) , who found regions of stability / instability associated with mean motion resonances in the 55 cancri planetary system .    using just dynamical stability as a metric , all of the stable ( green ) points in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] should be equally likely to support a @xmath6 planet . to narrow down the possible orbit of planet @xmath26",
    ", we calculate a quantity called `` fraction of time spent on detected orbits '' ( ftd , @xcite ) , which takes into account the back - reaction of planet @xmath26 on the orbits of planets @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the ftd provides a measure of the probability of finding planets @xmath4 and @xmath5 on their current best - fit orbits , including observational uncertainties ( see table 1 ) , taking into account perturbations from planet @xmath26 . in practice",
    ", the ftd simply evaluates the time spent by each observed planet ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) on their best - fit orbit , to within the uncertainties .",
    "a stable hypothetical planet can cause oscillations in the known planets orbits that may be larger than the uncertainties .",
    "if the ftd value is small , then the oscillation amplitudes are large and the chance of observing the system in it s current configuration is small .",
    "hence , it is less likely for a hypothetical planet @xmath26 to have those orbital parameters . if the ftd value is close to 1 , then it is more probable for planet @xmath26 to be in that orbit .",
    "note , however , that some systems may be observed in unlikely configurations ( veras & ford 2008 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the ftd for the stable region mapped out in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : yellow is the most likely region for planet @xmath26 to exist ( high ftd ) , and black is the least likely ( low ftd ; see color bar )",
    ". comparing figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xmath46 [ fig2 ] , the region @xmath47 au is an unlikely location for planet @xmath26 to exist . on the other hand , beyond @xmath48 au ,",
    "the ftd value is uniformly close to 1",
    ". therefore planet @xmath26 does not significantly perturb planet @xmath5 ( otherwise there would have been low ftd values ) , and acts effectively as a massless particle .",
    "this leaves a large contiguous stable region with high ftd values from @xmath49 au .",
    "we see that planet @xmath26 might exist in the habitable zone of hd 47186 .",
    "52.5% of the stable simulations are within the ehz , but it is not clear how likely it is that planet @xmath26 should exist there .",
    "we also performed @xmath50 simulations to see if two additional planets could exist in the stable zone .",
    "we placed two planets of @xmath6 each in the range @xmath51 au and @xmath52 .",
    "we found that @xmath53 cases resulted in unstable simulations and @xmath54 stable .",
    "most of the stable simulations ( @xmath55 ) had low eccentricity ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "in some stable cases , both hypothetical planets were in the ehz .",
    "additional simulations assuming that the masses of the known planets b & c are twice their minimum mass , equivalent to an inclination angle of 30 degrees , did not show any significant change in the stability boundaries .",
    "we found that the inner stability boundary near planet b is not at all affected , whereas the region between 1.5 - 1.8 au is slightly modified .",
    "specifically , regions stabilized by 2:1 mean motion resonance near 1.5 au , are now smaller with some of the stable points turning into unstable .",
    "overall , there is no significant change in the stability of the hz .",
    "we have shown that a hypothetical @xmath6 planet can exist between planets hd 47186 @xmath4 and @xmath5 for orbital distances of roughly 0.1  1.3 au ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "our ftd analysis shows that this planet is more likely to be found between @xmath9 and @xmath57 au ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we also find that two @xmath6 planets with low eccentricities can exist between planets b and c. a @xmath6 planet between 0.3 and 0.7 au ( the high ftd region in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) produces an rv amplitude of @xmath58 m / s , and should be detectable in the near future .",
    "it is possible that the two known planets in hd 47186 may have migrated to their present location .",
    "previous studies @xcite have shown that migrating giant planets do nt preclude the existence of terrestrial planets .",
    "in fact , if the outer planet migrated inward then the most likely place for an extra planet would be just interior to the 2:1 mmr , which lies in the middle of the ehz .",
    "planets of @xmath59 or less are thought to be the largest potentially terrestrial planets with rocky surfaces and thin atmospheres .",
    "this provides an effective upper limit for habitability as we know it .",
    "therefore hd 47186 offers the chance to detect a terrestrial planet in the hz of a nearby , solar - type star .",
    "roughly 30% of systems are thought to harbor super - earth sized planets ( @xmath60 , @xcite ) .",
    "if this frequency increases for lower - mass planets , the ( non-)detection of hd 47186 d could shed light on the fraction of stars with terrestrial - like planets in the habitable zone , sometimes called @xmath61 .",
    "if , in a complex system such as this one , a terrestrial - scale planet can form and survive , then perhaps @xmath61 is relatively large , increasing the likelihood the spacraft such as _ kepler _ and _ terrestrial planet finder _ will find habitable planets .",
    "we encourage observers to use our results to assist in the search for hd 47186 d.    the hd 47186 system is also another critical test of pps hypothesis , which asserts that planetary systems should not contain large empty gaps .",
    "the pps hypothesis follows naturally from the planet - planet scattering model @xcite and clearly predicts that there exists an additional planet in the gap between planets @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , two @xmath8 planets could exist in the stable zone if they are at low eccentricity .",
    "the connection between the simple , easily calculated value @xmath18 might provide some insight into the number of planets that can exist between two known planets .",
    "it would be interesting , then , to see if this one parameter can be used to test or not whether a system is packed .",
