    "the shapley supercluster ( ssc ) has for long been known as a large region of a high overdensity of galaxies ( shapley 1930 ) . located in in the direction of hydra - centaurus at @xmath4 it is one of the densest large scale concentrations of matter ( fabian 1991 ) in the universe .",

    "rass data is limited by the short exposure time ( i.e. @xmath17 sec vs. typical @xmath18 sec of pspc pointings ) . as only a part of the core of the ssc",

    "table [ tab_pointings ] lists the center and total observation time for each observation .",
    "the rass and pointed pspc data has been processed following the standard procedure for extended x - ray sources . in order to obtain the best signal - to - noise - ratio , only the 0.5 - 2 kev energy band ( the hard rosat band )",
    "is used ( snowden et al . 1994 ) .",
    "this reduces both the foreground x - ray emission of the galactic interstellar medium and the detector background .",
    "the absorption of the x - ray emission due to neutral hydrogen in the line of sight varies only little .",

    "we adopted in the following the mean value @xmath25 @xmath22 .",
    "we began our analysis by merging the data of the pointed rosat pspc observations .",

    "this choice compensates for the different fwmh of the point spread functions ( psf ) of pointed and rass observations as well as for the varying psf within the aperture of single pointings .",
    "the contour plot is overlaid on the binned flux . due to the shorter exposure time",
    ", the region outside the pointed observations ( i.e. the rass data ) exhibits a much lower signal - to - noise ratio resulting in a patchy appearance .",
    "the figure shows an overall picture of the region .",
    "neither the background nor point sources have been subtracted .",
    "local maxima of the count rate clearly trace the clusters a3562 , a3558 and a3556 as well as the two groups sc1327 - 312 and sc1329 - 313 . note also the region in the vicinity of a3556 .",
    "the peak of the count rate centered on a3556 is surrounded by faint x - ray emission with an extension of about @xmath29 in the east - west direction and @xmath30 in the north - south direction .",
    "we have checked for x - ray sources in this region .",
    "clearly visible is the point source 1rxs j132129.4 - 314054 of the rosat all - sky survey bright source catalogue .",
    "its position roughly coincidents with the western edge of the emission around a3556 .",
    "there are about five other point - like sources in this field , presumably associated with emission of single galaxies ( c.f .",
    "section [ sec_discuss ] ) .",
    "in analogy with a more comprehensive study of the x - ray emission of a3558 ( bardelli et al .",
    "1996 ) , we find the point - like sources to contribute @xmath31 to the observed count rate .    to check the significance of the elongated emission , we rebinned the central region into 31 bins as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_bins ] .",
    "the count rates in the various bins as obtained from the unfiltered data is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_flux ] .",
    "the error bars are the @xmath32 ( poisson ) errors .",
    "the background shown as dotted line ( @xmath33 cts sec@xmath3 arcmin@xmath34 ) is estimated from the average of the six bins with lowest flux .",
    "its value is in good agreement with the background estimated from the smaller northern and south - western fields ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 cts sec@xmath3 arcmin@xmath34 , respectively ) .",
    "since the emission found for the background bins shows some structure , we quote here conservative gaussian errors . while the region used for the first background estimation is covered by pointed observations , the two other fields lie mostly within the area of the rass . because of the poor photon statistics , the data from these two fields has not been included in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the peaks of the flux seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_bins ] are clearly associated with the clusters and rich groups in the field . from fig .",
    "[ fig_flux ] it is also seen that the emission between the clusters a3556 and a3558 lies well above the background .",
    "thus the x - ray emission traces the the core of the ssc as a filamentary - like structure with an extension of @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath38 @xmath39 mpc .    as a final test we checked for the effect of different bin sizes and applied the same analysis to the rosat a band ( channels 11 - 41 , @xmath28 0.1 - 0.4 kev ) , c band ( channels 52 - 90 @xmath28 0.5 - 0.9 kev ) and d band ( channels 91 - 201 @xmath28 0.9 - 2 kev ) .",
    "while no corresponding emission could be found in the a band , the emission observed in the c and d band traces the same structure .",
    "therefore we can exclude any contamination by galactic foreground emission miming the elongated emission .",
    "table [ tab_lum ] shows background subtracted fluxes and luminosities for various combinations of bins . for the conversion of the count rates in the rosat 0.5 - 2.0 kev band to the flux and luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band we used a raymond - smith code with metallicity 0.35 ( solar units ) .",
    "where available , the plasma temperature for the different regions has been taken from the literature . the plasma temperature of sc1327 - 312",
    "is estimated to be equal to sc1329 - 313 .",
    "for the faint emission between the clusters a3558 and a3556 as well as for the elongated emission in the vicinity of a3556 we assumed a plasma temperature of 1 kev , corresponding roughly to the temperature expected for ( poor ) groups of galaxies or for faint filamentary emission ( c.f . also section [ sec_discuss ] ) .",
    "the ( background subtracted ) flux and luminosity obtained for a3558 ( i.e. bins 13 - 17 ) are in good agreement with the corresponding values @xmath40 erg @xmath22 s@xmath3 and @xmath41 @xmath42 erg s@xmath3 ( rescaled to the energy range 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) published by bardelli et al .",
    "note however , that the values given in table [ tab_lum ] are of limited relevance since the binning used only crudely reflects the actual spatial structure of the different sources . in analogy ,",
    "the total flux and luminosity found for the whole structure by summing up the respective values for the bins 3 - 27 has to be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the combination of flux and temperature data with a spatial model for the emitting region allows for an estimation of the electron density and gas mass in the respective region . in order to get upper limits , we assume here the emitting gas to be uniformly distributed in a cylinder whose projection corresponds to the binned region ( i.e. the axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the line of sight ) .",
    "the volume of a bin then is @xmath43 @xmath44 mpc@xmath45 .",
    "the resulting electron density and gas mass estimations are quoted in table [ tab_lum ] .",
    "note that the approximation we applied overestimates the actual values since it assumes uniform distributions of the flux and emitting gas .",
    "thus the quoted values have to be considered as upper limits .",
    "the value @xmath46 we find for a3558 ( i.e. bins 13 - 17 ) is in rough agreement with @xmath47 within @xmath48 mpc calculated by bardelli et al .",
    "extrapolating to the whole structure , we find as an estimation of the total gas mass @xmath49 .",
    "an more precise determination of the gas mass as well as the estimation of the total mass should involve a more accurate model of both the gas and the flux distribution .      based on rosat data , bardelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) performed a comprehensive analysis of spectral properties of the emission of the central cluster a3558 ( for a comparison with asca data see markevitch & vikhlinin 1997 ) .",
    "because of comparable exposure times of a3558 and the rest of the region covered by pointed pspc observations , a corresponding analysis of the whole elongated emission should be possible .",
    "however this is beyond the scope of this letter . as a first step towards a spectral analysis of the region",
    "we determine here the hardness ratio ( i.e. x - ray color ) related to the rosat c and d energy band @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the flux in the rosat bands c and d , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_hardness1 ] the hardness ratio of the background corrected flux is shown as a function of the bin number .",
    "the errors are the @xmath32 errors .",
    "as it is the case for the flux , the hardness ratio traces the structure of the core of shapely .",
    "a clearly higher hardness ratio is found for the emission of clusters and groups than for intermediate , connecting emission .",
    "this is evidence for higher gas temperatures associated with density peaks , i.e. a result one would expect . for temperatures between 2 and 10 kev , and a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath25 @xmath22 the theoretical values for the hardness ratio range form 0.33 to 0.355 .",
    "these values are in rough agreement with the hardness ratio found for the clusters and groups in the field",
    ". the corresponding hardness ratio of the background ( i.e. the hardness ratio of six bins with lowest flux ) is -0.22 .    for a gas temperature of 1 kev ,",
    "the theoretical value for the hardness ratio is @xmath53 . as is clear form fig .",
    "[ fig_hardness1 ] , the hardness ratio between a3556 and a3558 lies bellow this value , indicating a temperature bellow 1 kev . the oscillating behavior of the hardness ratio westwards of a3556 ( i.e. for bins @xmath54 ) is due to the background subtraction procedure . by subtracting the average flux of the six bins with lowest flux , the background corrected net flux in some of these bins may become negative giving rise to observed oscillatory feature .",
    "the analysis of the rosat rass and pointed data of the core of the ssc shows clear evidence for x - ray emission related to a filamentary superstructure .",
    "optical observations ( bardelli et al . 1994 , 1998 ) reveal a striking similarity of isodensity contour lines of galaxy counts and x - ray contours .",
    "this strongly suggests a tight connection between the galaxy distribution and the x - ray emission .",
    "it is intriguing that galaxy counts and x - ray emission not only correlate on the scale of the single clusters in the field but also on the scale of the whole filamentary structure , including the region of faint emission between a3558 and a3556 and westwards of a3556 .",
    "the angular and redshift distribution of galaxies in this field provides strong evidence for a filamentary superstructure connecting the clusters a3562 , a3558 and a3556 ( bardelli et al . 1994 ) .",
    "we thus conclude the elongated x - ray emission of the core of the ssc to trace this filamentary superstructure .    in principle",
    "the elongated x - ray emission could arise from projection effects . however , there is little doubt that this is nt the case .",
    "first of all , redshift measurements indicate the structure to lie perpendicular to the line of sight which excludes projection effects .",
    "additional evidence comes from the flat , elongated x - ray emission of a3556 which is not comparable to the x - ray emission of compact , isolated clusters .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is additional independent evidence for an elongated gas distribution westwards of a3556 .",
    "the radio survey of a3556 ( venturi et al .",
    "1997 ) reveals a wide - angle tailed ( wat ) radio galaxy at a distance of @xmath55 mpc westwards from the center of a3556 .",
    "normally , wat galaxies are found at the center of groups or clusters and it is assumed that the tails are bent by gas flows due to a merging processes ( gomez et al .",
    "1997 ) . the original suggestion of venturi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the bent morphology of the wat galaxy is due to interaction with surrounding relatively cold gas ( i.e. @xmath56 kev ) is confirmed by the present study .",
    "x - ray emission from filamentary large scale structures is predicted by models ( e.g. bond et al . 1996 ) and recent n - body / hydro simulations ( e.g. cen & ostriker 1996 ) of structure formation .",
    "it is expected to originate from the hot phase of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) of temperature @xmath57 kev , either found in association with filaments themselves or with single cd galaxies or groups of galaxies tracing the structure .",
    "there have been only few claims of detection of x - ray emission on scales extending the scale of clusters of galaxies ( i.e. wang et al .",
    "1997 , soltan et al .",
    "1997 , but see also briel & henry 1995 ) .",
    "the fact that the present study found clear evidence for x - ray emission on the scale of @xmath1 mpc is reconciled by the extraordinary dense nature of the core of shapley .",
    "while the emission centered on the clusters a3558 , a3562 and a3556 as well as the one centered on the poor groups sc1329 - 313 and sc1327 - 312 is due to hot intercluster medium , the nature of the fainter emission connecting the whole structure is less obvious . to some extent , it remains debatable if the x - ray emission connecting the clusters a3558 and a3556 originates from poor groups of galaxies , from igm distributed between the clusters or from overlapping gas distributions . in general , the x - ray luminosity of groups of galaxies in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band is typically @xmath58 erg s@xmath3 ( henry et al .",
    "1995 , mulchaey et al .",
    "1996 ) . comparing this value to the x - ray luminosity found in the bins 18 - 20",
    "leads to @xmath59 groups in this region , a number which seems rather high .",
    "in addition , at least compact groups should be resolved as individual sources .",
    "we thus exclude this possibility .",
    "likewise , the background subtracted x - ray surface brightness of the bins 18 - 20 is @xmath60 erg @xmath22 s@xmath3 arcmin@xmath34 ( in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy band ) corresponding to about 2.5 times the upper limit for emission from filamentary large scale structure ( briel and henry , 1995 ) .",
    "while the extraordinary dense nature of the region could explain this difference , the overall elongated structure may also suggest that the emission seen in the bins 18 - 20 is due to overlapping gas distributions of a3558 and a3556 .",
    "in this case , the low hardness ratio of the intermediate region could be due to a temperature decrease in the outskirts of the clusters .",
    "yet another possibility is that we are observing the beginning of the merging of a3558 and a3556 .",
    "a more definite answer to this question should involve the determination of the temperature distribution .",
    "if the low temperature ( i.e. @xmath57 kev ) assumed for the gas in the bins 18 - 20 is confirmed , this would be a strong indication for x - ray emission originating from igm distributed on intrasupercluster scale .",
    "the low hardness ratio obtained for the questionable bins as well as the fact that we are dealing with an overall exceptional dense region indicates that this actually may be the case .",
    "in summary , our analysis shows that the central part of the shapley supercluster is traced by elongated x - ray emission connecting the three clusters of galaxies a3562 , a3558 , a3556 and the two groups sc1327 , sc1329 .",
    "the filamentary - like x - ray emission extends over @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath38 @xmath39 mpc .",
    "this is strong evidence for the original claim of bardelli et al .",
    "( 1994 ) that the three clusters a3562 , a3558 and a3556 form a physically connected , single structure .",
    "while the emission between a3558 and a3556 seems not to originate from groups of galaxies it remains debatable if it is due to overlapping gas distributions of a3558 and a3556 or if its of intrasupercluster origin . a more definite answer to this question as well as to questions related to the dynamical state of the structure",
    "could be provided by the temperature distribution of the region .",
    "its determination is thus of great interest .",
