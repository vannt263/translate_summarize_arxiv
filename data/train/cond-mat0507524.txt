    "the research in this paper has been motivated by several important recent developments in superconductivity : ( a ) the fabrication of thin - film squids ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) made of high-@xmath10 superconductors , @xcite ( b ) the study of noise generated by vortices in active and passive superconducting devices , @xcite and ( c ) line - width reduction in superconducting devices to eliminate noise due to vortices trapped during cooldown in the earth s magnetic field.@xcite    the fact that the london penetration depth @xmath0 increases as @xmath11 increases and diverges at @xmath10 is an important consideration for high-@xmath10 squids operated at liquid - nitrogen temperature .",
    "when @xmath0 is larger than the film thickness @xmath1 , the physical length that enters the equations governing the spatial variation of currents and fields is the pearl length@xcite @xmath2 .",
    "accordingly , the equations governing the behavior of active or passive thin - film superconducting devices depend upon the ratio of @xmath5 to the linear dimensions of the device . in particular , the equations governing squids involve not just the magnetic flux up through a contour within the squid , but the effective flux @xmath4 , which is the sum of the magnetic flux and a term proportional to the line integral of the current density around the same contour .",
    "while the effective flux @xmath4 is similar to london s fluxoid , @xcite which is quantized in multiples of the superconducting flux quantum @xmath12 , we show in the next section that @xmath4 is not quantized .",
    "we also give in sec .",
    "ii the basic equations , valid for any value of @xmath5 , that govern the behavior of a dc squid .",
    "a vortex trapped in the body of the squid during cooldown through the superconducting transition temperature @xmath10 in an ambient magnetic field generates a magnetic field and a screening current that together make a sizable vortex - position - dependent contribution @xmath13 to the effective flux @xmath4 .",
    "if such a vortex remains fixed in position and the temperature remains constant , this simply produces a harmless bias in @xmath4 . on the other hand , both vortex motion due to thermal agitation and temperature fluctuations generate corresponding fluctuations in @xmath13 and noise in the squid output . in sec .",
    "ii we show that to calculate @xmath13 , it is not necessary to calculate the spatial dependence of the vortex - generated fields and currents .",
    "instead , one may determine @xmath13 with the help of the sheet - current distribution of a circulating current in the absence of the vortex .    in sec .",
    "iii we apply the basic equations of sec .",
    "ii to calculate the properties of a model linear squid , which has the basic topology of a squid but is greatly stretched along one axis , such that the central portion resembles a coplanar stripline .",
    "the advantage of using such a model is that simple analytical results can be derived that closely approximate the exact numerically calculated quantities in the appropriate limits .",
    "in addition to calculating the field and current distributions for several values of @xmath5 , we calculate the total inductance , geometric inductance , kinetic inductance , and magnetic moment when the squid carries a circulating current .",
    "we calculate the field and current distributions , magnetic moment , and effective area @xmath14 when a perpendicular magnetic induction @xmath15 is applied and the effective flux @xmath16 is focused into the squid .",
    "finally , we calculate the field and current distributions and the magnetic moment for the zero - fluxoid state when the junctions are short - circuited and the sample remains in the state with @xmath17 when a perpendicular magnetic induction @xmath15 is applied .    in sec .",
    "iv , we present a brief summary of our results .",
    "our purpose in this section is to derive general equations that govern the behavior of a dc squid consisting of thin superconducting films of thickness @xmath1 less than the weak - field london penetration depth @xmath0 , such that the fields and currents are governed by the two - dimensional screening length or pearl length  @xcite @xmath18 .",
    "we calculate both the current @xmath19 through the squid [ see fig .  1 ] and the circulating current@xcite @xmath20 and describe how to calculate the critical current @xmath21 of the squid for arbitrary values of the squid s inductance @xmath22 . for this case , the contributions from line integrals of the current density to the _ effective flux _ in the hole can not be neglected , and the kinetic inductance makes a significant contribution to @xmath22 . when a perpendicular magnetic induction @xmath23 is applied , we calculate how much magnetic flux is focused into the squid s hole ; this flux also can be expressed in terms of the effective area@xcite of the hole .",
    "we also show how to calculate how much magnetic flux generated by a vortex in the main body of the squid is focused into the hole .    consider a dc squid in the @xmath24 plane , as sketched in fig .  1 .",
    "we suppose that the squid is symmetric about the @xmath25 axis , which lies along the centerline .",
    "the maximum josephson critical current is @xmath26 for each of the josephson junctions , shown as small black squares .     enters the main body of the squid from the counterelectrode below through two josephson junctions ( small black squares , labeled @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and divides into the currents @xmath29 and @xmath30 as shown.,width=302 ]",
    "the currents up through the left and right sides of the squid can be written as @xmath29 and @xmath31 . when the magnitude of @xmath32 , the total current through the squid , is less than the critical current @xmath21 , the equations that determine @xmath19 and the circulating current @xmath33 can be derived using a method similar to that used in ref .  .",
    "we begin by writing the local current density @xmath34 in the superconductors ( i.e. , the main body of the squid and the counterelectrode ) as@xcite @xmath35 , \\label{j}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the vector potential , @xmath12 is the superconducting flux quantum , and @xmath37 is the phase of the order parameter .",
    "the quantity inside the brackets , which is gauge - invariant , can be thought of as the superfluid velocity expressed in units of vector potential . from the point of view of the ginzburg - landau theory ,",
    "implicit in the use of this london - equation approach is the assumption that the applied fields and currents are so low that the magnitude of the order parameter is not significantly reduced from its equilibrium value in the absence of fields and currents .    to obtain the squid equations ,",
    "we integrate the vector potential around a contour @xmath38 that passes in a counterclockwise direction through both junctions , the main body of the squid , and the counterelectrode as shown in fig .  1 and write the result in two ways . since @xmath39 ,",
    "this integral yields , on the one hand , the magnetic flux in the @xmath40 direction @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the area surrounded by the contour @xmath38 and @xmath43 is the @xmath40 component of the net magnetic induction in the plane of the squid produced by the sum of a perpendicular applied field @xmath23 and the self - field @xmath44 generated via the biot - savart law by the supercurrent density @xmath45 . on the other hand , for those portions of the contour lying in the superconductors , we eliminate the line integrals of @xmath36 in favor of line integrals of @xmath46 using eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) .",
    "we then express the line integrals of @xmath47 in terms of the values of @xmath37 at the junctions .",
    "equating the two expressions for the line integral of @xmath36 , we find that the _ effective flux _ @xmath4 in the @xmath40 direction through the squid is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 with the integration contour @xmath38 now passing through both superconductors but excluding the junction barriers .",
    "these equations are equivalent to eq .",

    "according to the josephson equations,@xcite the junction supercurrents are @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in the above derivation",
    "we have assumed that the linear dimensions of the josephson junctions are much less than the josephson penetration depth @xmath57,@xcite and that the applied fields are sufficiently small that the josephson current densities and gauge - invariant phase differences are very nearly constant across the junction areas .",

    "any convenient path can be chosen for @xmath38 , provided only that the path remains in the superconducting material in the body of the squid and the counterelectrode .",
    "on the other hand , when there are vortices in the main body of the squid , the quantity @xmath4 increases by @xmath65 each time the contour @xmath38 is moved from a path inside the vortex axis to one enclosing the vortex axis .",
    "thus , without specifying the precise contour @xmath38 , @xmath4 is determined only modulo @xmath65 . however",
    ", this is of no physical consequence , because the gauge - invariant phases @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which also enter eq .",

    "the final equations determining the currents @xmath32 and @xmath69 are independent of the choice of contour @xmath38 and remain valid even when vortices are present in the main body of the squid .",
    "when the thickness @xmath1 of the squid is much larger than @xmath0 , the contours @xmath38 and @xmath62 can be chosen to be at the midpoint of the thickness , where @xmath46 is exponentially small , such that the line integrals of @xmath46 can be neglected .",

    "in sec .  ii of this paper we have presented general equations governing the static behavior of a thin - film dc squid for all values of the pearl length @xmath2 , where the london penetration depth @xmath0 is larger than @xmath1 , the film thickness .",
    "the squid s critical current @xmath3 depends upon the effective flux @xmath4 , which is the sum of the magnetic flux up through a contour surrounding the central hole and a term proportional to the line integral of the current density around this contour . for a symmetric squid",
    "there are three important contributions to @xmath4 : a circulating - current term @xmath462 , a vortex - field term @xmath13 , and a flux - focusing term @xmath16 , all of which depend upon @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath5 is a function of temperature , an important consequence is that all of the contributions to @xmath4 are temperature - dependent .",
    "the circulating - current term @xmath462 can be expressed in terms of the squid inductance @xmath22 and the circulating current @xmath69 via @xmath463 .",
    "the squid inductance has two contributions , @xmath464 , where the first term is the geometric inductance ( associated with the energy stored in the magnetic field ) and the second is the kinetic inductance ( associated with the kinetic energy of the circulating supercurrent ) .",
    "both contributions are functions of @xmath5 , since they both depend on the spatial distribution of the current density .",
    "however , @xmath356 depends only weakly upon @xmath5 , because for the same circulating current @xmath69 , the energy stored in the magnetic field does not vary greatly as @xmath5 ranges from zero to infinity . on the other hand , because the kinetic energy density is proportional to @xmath5 , @xmath357 is also nearly proportional to @xmath5 , with deviations from linearity occurring only for small values of @xmath8 .",
    "the vortex - field term can be written as @xmath465 , where @xmath466 is a dimensionless stream function describing the circulating sheet - current density @xmath467 . roughly speaking ,",
    "when @xmath5 is small , @xmath3 is most strongly dependent upon the vortex position when the vortex is close to the edges of the film , but when @xmath5 is large , @xmath3 is equally sensitive to the vortex position wherever the vortex is .",
    "recent experiments@xcite have used the relationship @xmath468 to determine the vortex - free sheet - current density @xmath469 from vortex images obtained via low - temperature scanning electron microscopy.@xcite the experimental data obtained in magnetic fields up to 40 @xmath470 t are in excellent agreement with numerical calculations of @xmath469 , confirming the validity of the above relationship , even in the presence of many ( up to 200 ) vortices in the squid washer .",
    "the flux - focusing term can be expressed as @xmath471 , where @xmath15 is the applied magnetic induction and @xmath302 is the effective area of the central hole of the squid .",
    "although @xmath302 is primarily determined by the dimensions of the squid , it also depends upon the value of @xmath472    to illustrate the @xmath5 dependence of the above quantities , in sec.iii of this paper we analyzed in detail the behavior of a long squid whose central region resembles a coplanar stripline .",
    "we numerically calculated the profiles of the sheet - current density , stream function , and magnetic induction in the equal - current , circulating - current , flux - focusing , and zero - fluxoid cases for various representative values of @xmath5 .",
    "we presented plots of the inductances @xmath473 @xmath356 , and @xmath357 , the effective area @xmath302 , and the magnetic moments for these cases .",
    "useful analytic approximations are provided for the @xmath430 limit in appendix a , for small @xmath8 and @xmath9 in appendix b , and for the @xmath459 limit in appendix c.    we are in the process of applying the above theory to square and circular squids , using the numerical method of ref ..",
