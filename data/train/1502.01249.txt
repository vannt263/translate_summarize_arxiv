    "interesting problems in science usually have a long and complex history .",
    "it is rare , though , that they have a prehistory or perhaps even mythology . yet , until recently this was the case of the yarkovsky effect .",
    "ivan o. yarkovsky , a russian civil engineer born in a family of polish descent , noted in a privately - published pamphlet ( _ yarkovsky _ , 1901 ; _ beekman _ ,",
    "2006 ) that heating a prograde - rotating planet should produce a transverse acceleration in its motion and thus help to counter - balance the assumed drag from the then - popular ether hypothesis . while this context of yarkovsky s work was mistaken and he was only roughly able to estimate the magnitude of the effect , he succeeded in planting the seed of an idea that a century later blossomed into a full - fledged theory of how the orbits of small objects revolving about the sun are modified by the absorption and re - emission of solar energy .",
    "it is mainly ernst j. pik who is to be credited for keeping yarkovsky s work alive and introducing it to western literature , long after the original pamphlet had been lost ( _ pik _ , 1951 ) .",
    "curiously , at about the same time , similar ideas also started to appear in russian regular scientific literature through the works of vladimir v. radzievskii and his collaborators ( _ radzievskii _ , 1952b ) . while radzievskii was also the first to consider the effects of systematic photon thrust on a body s rotation , his concept was based on a variable albedo coefficient across the surface ( _ radzievskii _ , 1952a ) .",
    "however , there is no strong evidence of large enough albedo variations over surfaces of asteroids or meteoroids .",
    "stephen j. paddack and john okeefe pushed the idea forward by realizing that irregular shape , and thermal radiation rather than just the reflected sunlight , will more efficiently change the meteoroid s spin rate .",
    "thence , the yarkovsky - okeefe - radzievskii - paddack effect ( yorp for short ) was born as an alter ego of the yarkovsky effect little more than half a century after yarkovsky s work ( see _ paddack _ , 1969 ; _ paddack and rhee _ , 1975 ; and _ rubincam _ , 2000 for summing up the history and coining the terminology ) .",
    "radzievskii s school also briefly touched upon a concept of a radiation - induced acceleration of synchronous planetary satellites ( _ vinogradova and radzievskii _ , 1965 ) , an idea that much later re - appeared in a slightly different form as a binary yorp ( or byorp for short ) effect ( _ uk and burns _ , 2005 ) .",
    "the three decades from the 1950 s to the 1970 s saw a slow revival and emergence of the concepts that eventually resulted in today s yarkovsky and yorp effects .",
    "the works that led to a major resurgence in these studies , however , occurred in the second half of the 1990 s through the work of david p. rubincam and paolo farinella .",
    "interestingly , both were studying thermal perturbations of artificial satellite motion . with that expertise",
    "they realized a direct link between the orbital effects acting on the geodynamics artificial satellites such as lageos and the orbital effects on small meteoroids ( e.g. , _ afonso et  al .",
    "_ , 1995 ; _ rubincam _ , 1995 , 1998 ; _ farinella et  al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "from there , a momentum was gained and a wealth of new results appeared , with applications extending to a dynamics of small asteroids and their populations ( e.g. , _ bottke et  al .",
    "_ , 2002a , 2006 ) .",
    "studies of the yarkovsky effect were soon followed by those of the yorp effect ( _ rubincam _ , 2000 ) .",
    "today , both effects belong to a core culture in planetary sciences , as well as beyond ( e.g. , ) , and have become an important part in the agenda of space missions ( e.g. , _ lauretta et  al . _ , 2015 ) . especially after the spectacular discovery of the `` once lost '' yarkovsky pamphlet in russian archives by dutch amateur astronomer george beekman ( see _ beekman _ , 2006 ) , it seems timely to review the current knowledge of the yarkovsky and yorp effects .",
    "this effort could start with a translation , and perhaps a commented edition , of the yarkovsky work ( presently available in the original form as an appendix of miroslav bro s thesis , ) .",
    "we look forward to future historians editing the more than a century long story of the yarkovsky and yorp effects , with all the known and possibly hidden roots , into a consolidated picture .",
    "leaving historical issues to their own life , we now turn to current scientific issues related to the yarkovsky and yorp effects .",
    "there are several good technical reviews already existing in the literature ( e.g. , _ bottke et  al .",
    "_ , 2002a , 2006 ) .",
    "while not always possible , we try to avoid discussing the same topics as presented in these previous texts . for instance",
    ", we do not review the elementary concepts of the yarkovsky and yorp effects , assuming the reader is familiar with them .",
    "rather , we try to focus on new results and ideas that emerged during the past decade and that will lead to research efforts in the next several years .",
    "we start with the simplest analytical models of the yarkovsky and yorp effects ( sec .",
    "this is because they provide useful insights , such as scalings with several key parameters , and their results are correct to leading order .",
    "they also allow us to understand why modeling of the yorp effect is inevitably more complicated than modeling of the yarkovsky effect . and yet , the quality of the yarkovsky and yorp effects detections , as well as other applications , have reached a level that requires more accurate models to be used .",
    "first steps towards these new models have been taken recently and these are briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "2.2 .      *",
    "the yarkovsky effect. * absorbed and directly reflected sunlight does not tend to produce long - term dynamical effects as far as orbital motion is concerned ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick and milani _ , 2000 ; _ ika and vokrouhlick _ , 2011 ) .",
    "the yarkovsky effect thus fundamentally depends on emitted thermal radiation and requires a body to have a non - zero thermal inertia .",
    "any meaningful evaluation of the yarkovsky effect , therefore , requires a thermophysical model of that body .",
    "fortunately , an evaluation of the yarkovsky effect imposes a minimum of requirements on the shape of the body ; even a simple spherical model provides us with a fair approximation of how the body will orbitally evolve .    while the yarkovsky effect results in variations to all of the orbital elements , what is distinct from most other perturbations is the secular effect in the semimajor axis @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we only discuss this contribution . assuming ( i ) a linearization of the surface boundary condition , ( ii ) a rotation about a spin axis fixed in the inertial space ( at least on a timescale comparable with the revolution about the sun ) , and ( iii ) a circular orbit about the sun , one easily finds that the total , orbit - averaged change in @xmath0 is composed of two contributions ( e.g. , _ rubincam _ , 1995 , 1998 ; _ farinella et  al .",
    "_ , 1998 ; _ vokrouhlick _ , 1998a , 1999 ) : @xmath1 the diurnal effect , and @xmath2 the seasonal effect . here , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radius of the body , @xmath5 the solar radiation flux at the orbital distance @xmath0 from the sun , @xmath6 is the mass of the body , @xmath7 is the light velocity , @xmath8 is the orbital mean motion and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 denoting the bond albedo ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick and bottke _ , 2001 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 factor is characteristic to any physical effect related to sunlight absorbed or scattered by the surface of the body . since @xmath12 , one obtains a typical scaling @xmath13 .    more importantly , the diurnal and seasonal components of the yarkovsky effect have a different dependence on the spin axis obliquity @xmath14 : ( i ) the diurnal part is @xmath15 , and consequently can make a positive or negative change of the semimajor axis , being maximum at @xmath16 and @xmath17 obliquity values , and ( ii ) the seasonal part is @xmath18 , and consequently always results in a decrease in semimajor axis , being maximum at @xmath19 obliquity .",
    "their magnitude is proportional to the function @xmath20 determined by the thermal parameters of the body and a frequency @xmath21 .",
    "the latter is equal either to the rotation frequency @xmath22 for the diurnal component , or the orbital mean motion @xmath8 for the seasonal component .",
    "the thermal parameters required by the model are : ( i ) the surface thermal conductivity @xmath23 , ( ii ) the surface heat capacity @xmath24 , and ( iii ) the surface density @xmath25 .",
    "these parameters , together with the frequency @xmath21 , do not appear in ( [ yark_ana3 ] ) individually .",
    "rather in the process of solving the heat diffusion problem and determination of the orbital perturbations , they combine in two relevant parameters .",
    "first , they provide a scale length @xmath26 which indicates a characteristic penetration depth of temperature changes assuming the surface irradiation is periodic with the frequency @xmath21 . the non - dimensional radius of the body @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ yark_ana3 ] ) is defined by @xmath28 .",
    "secondly , the surface thermal inertia @xmath29 enters the non - dimensional thermal parameter @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ yark_ana3 ] ) using a definition @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the thermal emissivity of the surface , @xmath33 the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath34 the sub - solar temperature ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "when the characteristic size @xmath4 of the body is much larger than @xmath36 ( a large - body limit ) , a situation met in the typical applications so far , the three @xmath37-coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ yark_ana3 ] ) are simply equal to @xmath38 ( _ rubincam _ , 1995 ; see _ vokrouhlick _ ( 1998a ) for their behavior for an arbitrary value of @xmath27 ) .",
    "hence , for large bodies the @xmath39-factors do not depend on the size @xmath4 and read @xmath40 . consequently , the yarkovsky effect is maximum when @xmath41 ; for small or large values of @xmath30 the effect vanishes . in this case , the semimajor axis secular change @xmath42 due to the yarkovsky effect scales as @xmath43 with the characteristic radius @xmath4 . for small asteroids , either in the near - earth space or in the main belt , @xmath44 is typically of the order of unity ( see also _ delb et  al .",
    "_ , this volume ) , while @xmath45 is much smaller , which implies that the diurnal yarkovsky component usually dominates the seasonal component .",
    "a handful of models were subsequently developed to probe the role of each of the simplifying assumptions mentioned above using analytical , semi - analytical or fully numerical methods .",
    "these include ( i ) an inhomogeneity of the thermal parameters ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick and bro _ , 1999 ) , ( ii ) a coupling of the diurnal and seasonal components of the yarkovsky effect ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick _ , 1999 ; _ sekiya and shimoda",
    "_ , 2013 , 2014 ) , ( iii ) effects of a non - spherical shape for simple ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick _ , 1998b ) or general geometries ( including non - convex shapes and the role of small - scale surface features ; sec .",
    "2.2 ) , ( iv ) a non - linearity of the surface boundary condition of the thermal model ( e.g. , _ sekiya and shimoda _ , 2013 , 2014 ) , ( v ) the role of very high orbital eccentricity ( e.g. , _ spitale and greenberg _ , 2001 , 2002",
    "; _ sekiya and shimoda _ , 2014 ) ; ( vi ) a non - principal axis rotation state ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ , 2005a ) , or ( vii ) the yarkovsky effect for binary asteroids ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ , 2005b ) .",
    "each of them was found to modify results from the zero - approximation model by as much as several tens of percent without modifying the fundamental dependence of the yarkovsky effect on obliquity , size or thermal parameters ( except perhaps for the special case of very high eccentricity orbits , where the sign of the yarkovsky effect may be changed ; _ spitale and greenberg _ , 2001 ) .",
    "* the yorp effect. * the yorp effect , the rotational counterpart of the yarkovsky effect , broadly denotes the torque arising from interaction with the impinging solar radiation . as in the orbital effect",
    ", the absorbed sunlight does not result in secular effects ( e.g. _ breiter et  al . _ , 2007 ; _",
    "nesvorn and vokrouhlick _ , 2008b ; _ rubincam and paddack _ , 2010 ) .",
    "both directly scattered sunlight in the optical band and the recoil due to thermally reprocessed radiation , however , produce dynamical effects that accumulate over long timescales . in principle , one would need to treat the two components of the yorp effect independently , since the bi - directional characteristics of the scattered and thermally emitted radiation are not the same and would produce different torques .",
    "additionally , the thermal component has a time lag due to the finite value of the surface thermal inertia and its bi - directional function should formally depend of the time history of the particular surface element .    while these issues are at the forefront of current research ( sec .",
    "2.2 ) , we start with a zero order approximation initially introduced by _ rubincam _ ( 2000 ) : ( i ) the surface thermal inertia is neglected , such that thermal radiation is re - emitted with no time lag , and ( ii ) the reflected and thermally radiated components are simply assumed lambertian ( isotropic ) .",
    "this approximation avoids precise thermal modeling and the results are relatively insensitive to the body s surface albedo value . at face value",
    ", this looks simple , but layers of complexity unfold with the geometrical description of the surface .",
    "this is because the yorp effect vanishes for simple shape models ( such as ellipsoids of rotation , _",
    "breiter et  al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) and stems from the irregular shape of the body ( see already _ paddack _ , 1969 ) .",
    "obviously , its quantitative description involves a near infinity of degrees of freedom if middle- to small - scale irregularities are included .",
    "this may actually be the case for real asteroids because these irregularities may present a large collective cross - section and thus could dominate the overall strength of the yorp effect .",
    "this is now recognized as a major obstacle to our ability to model the yorp effect ( sec .",
    "the importance of fine details of geometry , somewhat unnoticed earlier , were unraveled by the first analytical and semi - analytical models of the yorp effect .",
    "there were two approaches developed in parallel .",
    "_ scheeres _ ( 2007 ) and _ scheeres and mirrahimi _ ( 2008 ) used the polyhedral shape description as a starting point of their study , while _ nesvorn and vokrouhlick _",
    "( 2007 , 2008a ) and _ breiter and michaska _ ( 2008 ) used shape modeling described by a series expansion in spherical harmonics . to keep things simple , these initial models assumed principal axis rotation and disregarded mutual shadowing of the surface facets .",
    "both models predicted , after averaging the results over the rotation and revolution cycles , a long - term change of the rotational rate @xmath22 and obliquity @xmath14 ( the precession rate effect is usually much smaller than the corresponding gravitational effect due to the sun ) , which could be expressed as @xmath46 and @xmath47 here , @xmath48 with @xmath24 being the moment of inertia corresponding to the rotation axis ( shortest axis of the inertia tensor ) , @xmath49 are the legendre polynomials of even degrees , and @xmath50 are the corresponding associated legendre functions",
    ". the particular characteristics of the even - degree legendre polynomials and legendre functions of order 1 in eqs .",
    "( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yorp_ana2 ] ) under prograde to retrograde reflection @xmath51 indicate the behavior of @xmath52 and @xmath53 : ( i ) the rotation - rate change is symmetric , while ( ii ) the obliquity change is antisymmetric under this transformation .",
    "earlier numerical studies ( e.g. , _ rubincam _ , 2000 ; _ vokrouhlick and apek _ , 2002 ; _ apek and vokrouhlick _ , 2004 ) had suggested that the net effect of yorp on rotation - rate often vanishes near @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this feature was finally understood using eq .",
    "( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) because these obliquity values correspond to the roots of the second - degree legendre polynomial .",
    "the previous works that numerically treated smoothed surfaces thus mostly described situations when the first term in the series played a dominant role .",
    "when the effects of the surface finite thermal inertia are heuristically added to these models , one finds that only the coefficients @xmath56 change ( e.g. , _ nesvorn and vokrouhlick _ , 2007 , 2008a ; _ breiter and michaska _ , 2008 ) .",
    "this confirms an earlier numerical evidence of _ apek and vokrouhlick _ ( 2004 ) .    since @xmath57 , eqs .",
    "( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yorp_ana2 ] ) imply that both rotation - rate and obliquity effects scale with the characteristic radius as @xmath58 .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the `` more shallow '' size dependence of the yarkovsky effect , and it implies that yorp s ability to change the rotation state increases very rapidly moving to smaller objects . additionally , we understand well that for very small bodies the yarkovsky effect becomes eventually nil . when the characteristic radius @xmath4 becomes comparable to the penetration depth @xmath59 of the diurnal thermal wave the efficient heat conduction across the volume of the body makes temperature differences on the surface very small .",
    "however , _",
    "breiter et  al . _",
    "( 2010a ) suggested that in the same limit the yorp strength becomes @xmath43 , still increasing for small objects .",
    "additionally , their result was only concerned with the thermal component of the yorp effect , while the part related to the direct sunlight scattering in optical waveband continues to scale with @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the fate of small meteoroids rotation is still unknown at present .    the principal difference in complexity of the yorp effect results in eqs .",
    "( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yorp_ana2 ] ) , as compared to simple estimates in eqs .",
    "( [ yark_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yark_ana2 ] ) for the yarkovsky effect , is their infinite series nature .",
    "the non - dimensional coefficients @xmath60 and @xmath56 in eqs .",
    "( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yorp_ana2 ] ) are determined by the shape of the body , either analytically or semi - analytically ( e.g. , _ nesvorn and vokrouhlick _ , 2007 , 2008a ; _ scheeres and mirrahimi _ , 2008 ; _ breiter and michaska _ , 2008 ; _ kaasalainen and nortunen _ , 2013 ) .",
    "interestingly , analytical methods help to understand that torque component that changes the spin rate and the components that change the axis orientation couple , at leading order , to different attributes of the surface .",
    "the spin torque couples to chirality  the difference between eastward and westward facing slopes  while the other components couple merely to asphericity .",
    "mathematically , this concerns the symmetric and antisymmetric terms in the fourier expansion of the topography .",
    "if mutual shadowing of the surface facets is to be taken into account , one may use a semi - analytic approach mentioned by _",
    "breiter et  al . _",
    "( 2011 ) ; see already _ scheeres and mirrahimi _ ( 2008 ) .",
    "depending on details of the shape , the series in ( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yorp_ana2 ] ) may either converge quickly , with the first few terms dominating the overall behavior , or may slowly converge , with high - degree terms continuing to contribute ( e.g. , _ nesvorn and vokrouhlick _",
    ", 2007 , 2008a ; _ kaasalainen and nortunen _ , 2013 ) .    while this behavior had been noticed in analytical modeling , a detailed numerical study of yorp sensitivity on astronomically - motivated , small - scale surface features such as craters and/or boulders",
    "was performed by _ statler _ ( 2009 ) .",
    "this also allowed _ statler _ ( 2009 ) to suggest a new direction to yorp studies .",
    "he noted that the sensitivity of yorp on such small scale features may affect its variability on short - enough timescales to significantly modify the long - term evolution of rotation rate , with the evolution changing from a smooth flow toward asymptotic state to a random walk ( sec .",
    "2.2 ) .    the quadrupole ( @xmath61 ) , being the highest multipole participating in the series expansion in eqs .",
    "( [ yorp_ana1 ] ) and ( [ yorp_ana2 ] ) , is related to the assumption of coincidence between the reference frame origin and the geometric center of the body ( i.e. , its center - of - mass for homogeneous density distribution ) .",
    "if instead the rotation axis is displaced from this point , additional terms in the series become activated and the coefficients @xmath62 become modified , and thus the predicted yorp torque will change ( e.g. , _ nesvorn and vokrouhlick _ , 2007 , 2008a ) .",
    "this theoretical possibility has found an interesting geophysics interpretation for ( 25143 ) itokawa s anomalously small yorp value by _ scheeres and gaskell _ ( 2008 ) ( see sec .  3.2 , _",
    "breiter et  al .",
    "_ , 2009 , and eventually _ lowry et  al . _ , 2014 ) .      * resolved and unresolved surface irregularities. * while the models discussed above suffice to describe broad - scale features of the yarkovsky and yorp effects , there are important aspects which are intrinsically _ nonlinear_. current models need to explicitly treat these nonlinearities in order to capture the physical essence of radiation recoil mechanisms and to provide precise predictions . here",
    "we discuss some recent efforts along these lines .",
    "the simplest of such nonlinear effects is _ shadowing _ of some parts of the surface by other parts , which can occur on surfaces that are not convex . by blocking the sun ,",
    "shadowing lowers the incident flux , and increases the temperature contrast , compared to the clear - horizon case .",
    "computationally , shadowing requires testing whether the sunward - pointing ray from each surface element intersects another surface element ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick and apek _ , 2002 ) .",
    "this `` who blocks whom '' problem is of @xmath63 complexity ( where @xmath64 is the number of surface elements ) ; but there are strategies for storing an initial @xmath65 calculation so that all subsequent calculations are only @xmath66 ( e.g. , _ statler _ , 2009 ) .",
    "closely related to shadowing are the processes of _ self - heating _ ( e.g. , _ rozitis and green _ , 2013 ) ; these can be split conceptually into _ self - illumination _ , in which a surface element absorbs reflected solar flux from other parts of the surface , and _ self - irradiation _",
    ", where it absorbs re - radiated thermal infrared .",
    "self - heating has the tendency to reduce the temperature contrast , by illuminating regions in shadow .",
    "computing these effects requires prescriptions for the angular distribution of reflected and re - radiated power from an arbitrary surface element , as well as the solution to the `` who sees whom '' problem  similar to the `` who blocks whom '' problem from shadowing .",
    "but since energy is traded between pairs of surface elements , self - heating , unlike shadowing , is unavoidably @xmath63 if full accuracy is required .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "2.1 , a periodic driving at a frequency @xmath21 introduces a length scale , the thermal skin depth @xmath36 .",
    "asteroid surfaces are driven quasi - periodically , with the fundamental modes at the diurnal and seasonal frequencies . for typical materials",
    ", @xmath36 is of the order of meters for the seasonal cycle and millimeters to centimeters for the diurnal cycle .",
    "if the surface s radius of curvature @xmath67 satisfies the condition @xmath68 , one can consider surface elements to be independent ( facilitating parallelization ) and solve the heat conduction problem as a function of the depth only .",
    "the radiated flux then depends on the material parameters only through the thermal inertia @xmath69 .",
    "most models that treat conduction explicitly do so in such 1d approximation .",
    "standard finite - difference methods are typically used to find a solution over a rotation or around a full orbit ; but numerical convergence can be slow ( though acceleration schemes were also considered , _",
    "breiter et  al .",
    "_ , 2010b ) . whether the condition @xmath68 is truly satisfied depends on the scale on which topography",
    "is resolved .",
    "a surface boulder can give an object a locally small radius of curvature and 3d effects may become important .",
    "full 3d conduction is computationally expensive ( e.g. , _ golubov et  al .",
    "_ , 2014 ; _ eveek et  al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) , but the potential consequences are significant . in this case",
    ", a general finite - element method is used to solve the heat diffusion problem .",
    "_ surface roughness _ concerns the effects of unresolved texture on reflection , absorption , and re - radiation .",
    "parametric models for a rough - surface reflectance are well developed ( e.g. , _ hapke _ , 1993 , and references therein ; _ breiter and vokrouhlick _ , 2011 , in an application to the yorp effect ) , though the functional forms and parameter values are matters of current research .",
    "models for the thermal emission are at present purely numerical . in the most complete implementation ( _ rozitis and green _ , 2012 , 2013 ) , a high - resolution model of a crater field is embedded inside a coarse - resolution model of a full object .",
    "the primary effects of roughness in this model are to enhance the directionality ( `` beaming '' ) of the radiated intensity ( relative to lambertian emission ) , and to direct the radiated momentum slightly away from the surface normal , toward the sun .",
    "roughness models for emission and for reflection are not automatically mutually consistent ; and the emission models employ the 1d approximation for heat conduction despite the likelihood that @xmath67 may not be much larger than @xmath59 at the roughness scale .    finally , nonlinear _ dynamical coupling _ affects both spin evolution and the orbital drift modulated by the spin state .",
    "yarkovsky evolution models have generally incorporated heuristic prescriptions based on the yorp cycle ( e.g. , _ rubincam _ , 2000 ; _ vokrouhlick and apek _ , 2002 ) , with possibly important effects of spin - induced material motion or reshaping included only in rudimentary ways .",
    "these processes may be modeled with particle - based discrete - element numerical codes ( e.g. , _",
    "richardson et  al .",
    "_ , 2005 ; _ schwartz et  al .",
    "_ , 2012 ) and semi - numerical granular dynamics in pre - defined potential fields ( e.g. , _ scheeres _ , 2015 ) .",
    "simulated rubble piles artificially fed with angular momentum are seen to reshape and shed mass ( e.g. , _ walsh et  al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; _ scheeres _ , 2015 ) .",
    "linking a particle code with a thermophysical yorp model would then allow the coupled spin and shape evolution to be followed self - consistently .",
    "_ statler _ ( 2009 ) argued that topographic sensitivity would make rubble piles , or any objects with loose regolith , susceptible to possibly large changes in torque triggered by small , centrifugally driven changes in shape .",
    "repeated interruptions of the yorp cycle might then render the overall spin evolution stochastic and significantly extend the timescale of the yorp cycles ( _ self - limitation _ property of yorp ) .",
    "_ cotto - figueroa et  al . _",
    "( 2015 ) have tested this prediction by simulating self - consistently the coupled spin and shape evolution ( togging between configurations in a limit cycle ) , and stagnating behaviors that result in yorp self - limitation .",
    "_ bottke et  al . _",
    "( 2015 ) implemented a heuristic form of such stochastic yorp in a yarkovsky drift model to find an agreement with the structure of the eulalia asteroid family .",
    "accurate yarkovsky measurements allow constraining mass and bulk density ( sec .",
    "4.1 ) , but rely on precise models , with an important component due to the surface features discussed above . _ rozitis and green _",
    "( 2012 ) show that surface roughness can increase the yarkovsky force by tens of percent , owing mainly to the beaming . including the seasonal effect caused by the deeper - penetrating thermal wave",
    "can have a comparable influence .",
    "self - heating , in contrast , has a minimal influence on yarkovsky forces ( e.g. , _ rozitis and green _ , 2013 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the same works indicate that the yorp effect is in general dampened by beaming because it equalizes torques on opposite sides of the body .    _ golubov and krugly _",
    "( 2012 ) highlight another small - scale aspect of the yorp effect : an asymmetric heat conduction across surface features for which @xmath70 .",
    "a rock conducts heat from its sunlit east side to its shadowed west side in the morning , and from its west side back to its east side in the afternoon . owing to nighttime cooling ,",
    "the morning temperature gradient is steeper , and hence more heat is conducted to , and radiated from , the west side , resulting in an eastward recoil .",
    "clearly , if the collective cross - section of such surface features is large , details of conduction across them may have significant consequences .",
    "ideally , the situation calls for a complete 3d heat transfer model ( e.g. , _ golubov et  al . _ , 2014 ; _ eveek et  al . _ , 2015 ) .",
    "importantly , these studies indicate an overall tendency for yorp to spin objects up . however , a better understanding of small - scale surface effects is essential to understand yorp s long - term dynamics .",
    "* time domain issues ( tumbling). * a particular problem in the modeling of the thermal effects occurs for tumbling bodies .",
    "this is because solving the heat diffusion in the body involves also the time domain . while the spatial dimensions are naturally bound , the time coordinate is not in general .",
    "however , both analytical and numerical methods involve finite time domains : the analytical approaches use a development in the fourier series , while the effective numerical methods use iterations that require one to identify configurations at some moments in time . for bodies rotating about the principal axis of the inertia tensor , thus having a fixed direction in the inertial space , it is usually easy to modify the rotation period within its uncertainty limits such that it represents an integer fraction of the orbital period .",
    "the orbital period is then the fundamental time interval for the solution .",
    "this picture becomes more complicated for tumbling objects whose rotation is not characterized by a single time period .",
    "rather , it is fully described with two periods , the proper rotation period and precession period , which may not be commensurable .",
    "this situation has been numerically studied by _",
    "vokrouhlick et  al . _",
    "( 2005a ) in the case of ( 4179 )  toutatis , and more recently also in the case of ( 99942 )  apophis by _ vokrouhlick et  al . _",
    "both studies suggest the tumbling may not necessarily `` shut down the yarkovsky effect '' , at least in the large - bodies regime .",
    "rather , it has been found that the yarkovsky acceleration for these tumbling objects is well represented by a simple estimate valid for bodies rotating about the shortest axis of the inertia tensor in a direction of the rotational angular momentum and with the fundamental period of tumbling , generally the precession period .    * more than one body ( binarity). * another particular case is the yarkovsky effect for binaries ( see also _ vokrouhlick et  al . _ , 2005b ) .",
    "unless the satellite has nearly the same size as the primary component , the rule of thumb is that the heliocentric motion of the system s center - of - mass is affected primarily by the yarkovsky acceleration of the primary component .",
    "the motion of the satellite feels rather the yarkovsky acceleration of the satellite itself .",
    "nevertheless , a secular change in the orbit of the satellite is actually caused by an interplay of the thermal effects and the shadow geometry in the system dubbed the yarkovsky - schach effect ( and introduced years ago in space geodesy ; _ rubincam _ , 1982 ) .",
    "however , it turns out that the byorp effect , discussed in sec .",
    "2.3 , is more important and dominates the orbital evolution of the satellite . * 2.3 binary yorp",
    "*    the binary yorp ( byorp ) effect was first proposed in a paper by _ uk and burns _",
    "they noted that an asymmetrically - shaped synchronous secondary asteroid in a binary system should be subject to a net force differential that acts on average in a direction tangent to the orbit .",
    "thus , as the secondary orbits about the primary body and maintains synchronicity , this would lead to either an acceleration or deceleration of the secondary which would cause the mutual orbit of the system to spiral out or in , respectively .",
    "this seminal paper presented a basic conceptual model for the byorp effect and provided a broad survey of many of the possible implications and observable outcomes of this effect .",
    "it also numerically studied the evolution of randomly shaped secondary bodies over a year to establish the physical validity of their model .",
    "it is key to note that a necessary condition for the byorp effect is that at least one of the bodies be synchronous with the orbit , and it can be shut off if both bodies are non - synchronous .",
    "_ uk and burns _ concluded that the byorp effect should be quite strong and lead binary asteroids to either spiral in towards each other or cause them to escape in relatively short periods of time .",
    "this was further expanded in a second paper by _ uk _ ( 2007 ) that outlined significant implications for the rate of creation and destruction of binary asteroid systems in both the nea and main belt population , leading to the initial estimate of binary asteroid lifetimes due to byorp on the order of only @xmath71  ky .    _",
    "mcmahon and scheeres _",
    "( 2010a , b ) then developed a detailed analytical model of the byorp effect that utilized the existing shape model of the ( 66391 ) 1999  kw4 binary asteroid satellite ( _ ostro et  al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) . in their approach",
    "the solar radiation force was mapped into the secondary - fixed frame and expanded as a fourier series , following a similar approach to the yorp model development of _ scheeres _ ( 2007 ) .",
    "this enables any given shape model to be expressed with a series of coefficients that can be directly computed , and allows for time averaging . using this approach they showed that the primary outcome of the byorp effect could be reduced to a single parameter the so - called `` byorp coefficient '' @xmath72 uniquely computed from a given shape model . henceforth , if the secondary is in a near - circular orbit , the entire byorp effect results in simple evolutionary equations for semi - major axis @xmath0 and eccentricity @xmath73 of the binary orbit @xmath74 where again @xmath5 is the solar radiation flux at the heliocentric distance @xmath75 ( equal to the semimajor axis of the heliocentric orbit ) , @xmath76 with @xmath77 being the eccentricity of the heliocentric orbit , @xmath7 is the light velocity , @xmath78 is the mass of the secondary , and @xmath79 is the gravitational parameter of the binary system . if the orbit is expansive ( @xmath80 ) , the eccentricity will be stabilized , and vice - versa ( see already _ uk and burns _ , 2005 ) . in the case where the binary orbit is highly elliptic ,",
    "the evolutionary equations become much more complex , and require additional fourier coefficients to be included into the secular equations , as discussed in detail in _ mcmahon and scheeres _ ( 2010a ) .",
    "the byorp coefficient @xmath72 is computed as a function of the shape of the body and the obliquity of the binary s orbit relative to the heliocentric orbit of the system .",
    "assume a model for the instantaneous solar radiation force acting on the secondary has been formulated by some means , denoted as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the mean anomalies of the binary mutual orbit and heliocentric orbit , respectively .",
    "then the computation of the byorp coefficient requires double averaging of the radiation force over the binary and heliocentric revolution cycles , and projection in the direction of binary orbital motion ( denoted here in abstract as @xmath84 ) : @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the solar radiation pressure acting on the unit surface area of the body at the heliocentric distance @xmath87 .",
    "the normalization by @xmath88 implies that units of the byorp coefficient are measured in area ; thus @xmath72 can be further normalized by dividing it by the effective radius squared of the secondary body .",
    "the byorp coefficient is a function of several physical quantities such as albedo , surface topography , and potentially thermo - physical effects .",
    "however , the strongest variation of the byorp coefficient is seen to vary with the binary obliquity with respect to the heliocentric orbit ( fig .",
    "[ fig_byorp ] ) .",
    "if the synchronous body is rotated by 180@xmath89 relative to the orbit , then the sign of the byorp coefficient will be uniformly reversed . due to this , when a body initially enters into a synchronous state it is supposed that the probability of it being either positive or negative is 50% .",
    "a more recent analysis of the byorp effect was published by _",
    "steinberg and sari _ ( 2011 ) who found a positive correlation between the strength of the byorp and yorp effects for bodies , and provided predictions related to the byorp - driven evolution of the obliquity of a binary asteroid .",
    "in addition , they probed the possible effects of thermophysical models on the evolution of a binary system .",
    "the above discussions focus on the effect of byorp in isolation , and not in conjunction with other evolutionary effects .",
    "recent work though has found that the byorp effect can mix with other evolutionary effects in surprising ways that require additional verification and study .",
    "these are primarily discussed later in sec .",
    "5.3 , where the long - term evolution of binary systems subject to byorp is briefly considered . however , one of these combined effects has significant implications and is discussed here .",
    "in particular , _ jacobson and scheeres _ ( 2011b ) proposed existence of an equilibrium between the byorp effect and tides . for this equilibrium to exist the byorp coefficient must be negative , leading to a contractive system , and the primary asteroid must be spinning faster than the orbit rate .",
    "this creates a tidal dissipation torque that acts to expand the secondary orbit .",
    "based on current theories of energy dissipation within rubble pile asteroids ( e.g. , _ goldreich and sari _ , 2009 ) , _ jacobson and scheeres _ noted that all singly - synchronous rubble pile binary asteroids with a negative byorp coefficient for the secondary should approach a stable equilibrium that balances these two effects . this is significant as it provides mechanism for byorp s persistent effect to become stalled , leaving binary asteroids that should remain stable over long time spans .",
    "this , in turn , means that rapid formation of binary asteroids is not needed to explain the current population .",
    "accurate observations have now allowed direct detections of both the yarkovsky and yorp effects .",
    "this is an important validation of their underlying concepts , but also it motivates further development of the theory .",
    "these direct detections have two aspects of usefulness or application .",
    "first , the yarkovsky effect is being currently implemented as a routine part of the orbit determination of small near - earth asteroids whose orbits are accurately constrained in the forefront software packages .",
    "additionally , the yarkovsky effect is already known to be an essential part of the earth impact hazard computations in selected cases ( sec .",
    "4.2 and _ farnocchia et  al .",
    "_ , this volume ) .",
    "second , many applications of the yarkovsky and yorp effects involve statistical studies of small body populations in the solar system rather than a detailed description of the dynamics of individual objects . aside from a general validation ,",
    "the known detections help in setting parameter intervals that could be used in these statistical studies .",
    "the possibility of detecting the yarkovsky effect as a measurable orbital deviation was first proposed by _",
    "vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) .",
    "the idea is at first astounding given that the transverse thermal recoil force on a half - kilometer near - earth asteroid ( nea ) should be at most @xmath90  n , causing an acceleration of only @xmath91 . and yet such small perturbations can lead to tens of kilometers of orbital deviation for half - kilometer neas after only a decade . in principle , such a deviation is readily detectable during an earth close approach , either by optical or radar observations , but the key challenge is that the precision of the position prediction must be significantly smaller than the yarkovsky deviation that is to be measured . in practical terms",
    "this means that detection of the yarkovsky effect acting on a typical half - kilometer nea requires at least three radar ranging apparitions spread over a decade , or several decades of optical astrometry in the absence of radar ranging . of course smaller objects could in principle",
    "reveal the yarkovsky effect much more quickly , but the problem for small objects is that it is more difficult to build up suitable astrometric datasets . because of this , only a few objects with diameters @xmath92  m have direct detections of the yarkovsky effect .",
    "it should be pointed out that observations do not allow to measure the secular change in the orbital semimajor axis directly .",
    "rather , they reveal an associated displacement in the asteroid position along the orbit , an effect that progresses @xmath93 in a given time @xmath94 ( see _ vokrouhlick et  al . _ , 2000 ) .",
    "this is similar to the way how the yorp effect is observed as discussed in sec .",
    "3.2 .    as predicted by _",
    "vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ ( 2000 ) , ( 6489 )  golevka was the first asteroid with an unambiguous detection of the signature of the yarkovsky effect in its orbit ( _ chesley et  al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) . in this case",
    "the detection was possible only due to the availability of three well - separated radar ranging apparitions , in 1991 , 1995 and 2003 .",
    "the first two radar apparitions constrain the semimajor axis , affording a precise position prediction in 2003 , while the 2003 radar ranging revealed a deviation from a ballistic trajectory .",
    "figure  [ fya ] depicts the predicted 2003 delay - doppler observations with their uncertainty along with the associated uncertainties .",
    "the predictions were well separated with @xmath95 confidence , and the actual asteroid position fell close to the yarkovsky prediction .",
    "the second reported detection of the yarkovsky effect was for ( 152563 ) 1992  bf , which was also the first detection that did not rely on radar astrometry ( _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "this half - kilometer asteroid had a 13-year optical arc ( 1992 - 2005 ) and four archival positions over two nights dating to 1953 .",
    "these so - called precovery observations could not be fit to a purely gravitational orbit , but including the yarkovsky effect in the orbit fitting enabled the observations to fit well and allowed a @xmath42 estimate with the signal - to - noise ratio snr @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "[ fya_bf ] ) . in these cases , where the detection relies heavily on isolated and archival data , caution is warranted to avoid the possibility that mis - measurement or astrometric time tag errors are corrupting the result . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fya_bf ] , the 1953 position offsets could not be attributed to timing errors , and the trail positions were remeasured with modern catalogs .    in subsequent studies a progressively increasing number of yarkovsky detections have been announced ( _ chesley et  al . _ , 2008 ; _ nugent et  al . _ , 2012a ; _",
    "farnocchia et  al . _ , 2013b ) .",
    "the most precise yarkovsky measurement is that of ( 101955 )  bennu , the target of the osiris - rex asteroid sample return mission , which has a @xmath97% precision yarkovsky detection , by far the finest precision reported to date . at the extremes ,",
    "asteroid 2009  bd is the smallest object ( @xmath98  m ) with a verified yarkovsky detection , which was achieved because of its earth - like orbit and the two - year arc of observations that the orbit enabled ( _ mommert et  al .",

    "_ , 2013b ) , which are both exceptionally well observed , having 4 and 5 radar apparitions , respectively .    to initially test for a signal from the yarkovsky effect in the astrometric data of a given object one can fit the orbit with a transverse nongravitational acceleration @xmath101 , with @xmath102 being an estimated parameter , in addition to the orbital elements",
    ". this simple model yields a mean semimajor axis drift rate proportional to @xmath102 , thus capturing the salient orbital deviation due to the yarkovsky effect .",
    "the approach of using a one - parameter ( @xmath102 ) yarkovsky model is particularly convenient because it completely bypasses the thermophysical processes that are otherwise fundamental to the yarkovsky effect . instead , by focusing only on the level of perturbation visible in the orbit ,",
    "one is able to discern the yarkovsky effect in absence of any knowledge of physical properties . and",
    "yet , as we shall see in sec .",
    "4.1 , the detection of a yarkovsky drift can be used to estimate or infer a number of the physical and dynamical characteristics of the body .",
    "obviously , in the case of bodies with particular interest , one can use a detailed thermophysical model of the yarkovsky acceleration for the orbit determination in a subsequent analysis .",
    "a population - wise , head - on approach to yarkovsky detection thus starts with the list of asteroids with relatively secure orbits , e.g. , at least @xmath71  days of observational arc , among the neas .",
    "for each considered object the statistical significance of the yarkovsky effect is obtained from the estimated value of @xmath102 and its _ a posteriori _",
    "uncertainty @xmath103 according to @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is generally considered to be a significant detection .",
    "another parameter that is helpful in interpreting the results for a given object is the ratio between the estimated value of @xmath102 and the expected value for extreme obliquity and the known or inferred asteroid size , which we call @xmath106 .",
    "the value of @xmath106 can be obtained by , for instance , a simple diameter scaling from the bennu result ( _ farnocchia et  al . _ , 2013b ; _ chesley et  al .",

    "the ratio @xmath107 provides an indication of how the estimated value of @xmath102 compares to what could be theoretically expected .",

    "a large value of @xmath109 could also imply a spurious @xmath102 estimate due to corrupt astrometry in the orbital fit . on the other hand",

    "we find 35 such cases in the current nea catalog , six of which have @xmath193 ( table  [ yark_nondet ] ) .",

    "similar to the case of the yarkovsky effect , the yorp detection is enabled via accurate measurement of a phase @xmath200 associated with the rotation rate .",
    "this is because when the rotation frequency @xmath22 changes linearly with time , @xmath201 ( adopting the simplest possible assumption , since @xmath52 may have its own time variability ) , the related phase @xmath200 grows quadratically in time , @xmath202 .",
    "additionally , other perturbations ( such as an unresolved weak tumbling ) do not produce an aliasing signal that would disqualify yorp detection .",
    "so the determination of the yorp - induced change in the rotation rate @xmath52 may basically alias with the rotation rate frequency @xmath203 itself in the @xmath204 model .",
    "this is because small variations in @xmath203 propagate linearly in time in the rotation phase .",

    "( this volume ) for a more complete discussion of yarkovsky - driven impact hazard analyses .      the yarkovsky effect , with its ability to secularly change the semimajor axes of meteoroids ( precursors of meteorites , which are believed to be fragments of larger asteroids located in the main belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter ) , was originally proposed to be the main element driving meteorites to the earth ( see already _ pik _ , 1951 or _ peterson _ , 1976 ) .",
    "however , direct transport from the main belt , say as a small body slowly spiraling inward toward the sun by the yarkovsky effect , required very long timescales and unrealistic values of the thermal parameters and/or rotation rates for meter size bodies . moreover , am / pm fall statistics and measured pre - atmospheric trajectories in rare cases ( like the pbram meteorite ) indicated many meteorites had orbits with the semimajor axis still close to the main belt values .",
    "the problem has been overcome in the late 1970s and early 1980s by advances in our understanding of asteroid dynamics .",
    "numerous works have shown that the transport routes that connect main belt objects to planet - crossing orbits are in fact secular and mean motion resonances with giant planets , such as the @xmath256 secular resonance at the lower border of the main asteroid belt and/or the 3/1 mean motion resonance with jupiter . putting this information together with the yarkovsky effect , _ vokrouhlick and farinella _ ( 2000 ) were able to construct a model in which meteoroids or their immediate precursor objects are collisionally born in the inner and/or central parts of the main belt , from where they are transported to the resonances by the yarkovsky effect .",
    "en route , some of the precursors may fragment , which can produce new swarms of daughter meteoroids which eventually reach the escape routes to planet crossing orbits . with this model , _ vokrouhlick and farinella _ could explain the distribution of the cosmic - ray exposure ages of stony meteorites as a combination of several timescales : ( i ) the time it take a meteoroid to collisionally break , ( ii ) the time it takes a meteoroid to travel to a resonance , ( iii ) the time it takes for that resonance to deliver the meteoroid to an earth - crossing orbit , and ( iv ) the time it takes the meteoroid on a planet - crossing orbit to hit the earth .    while successful to the first order , this model certainly contains a number of assumptions and potentially weak elements , especially in the light of subsequent rapid development of the yorp effect theory , that warrant further work .",
    "for instance , one of the difficulties in refining the meteorite delivery models is the uncertainty in identification of the ultimate parent asteroid ( or asteroids ) for a given meteorite class ( e.g. , _ vernazza et  al .",
    "_ , this volume ) .",
    "thus , among the ordinary chondrites we have a reasonable guess that ll - chondrites originate from the flora region ( or the asteroid ( 8)  flora itself ) and the l - chondrites originate from disruption of the gefion family . there were numerous guesses for the h - chondrite source region ( such as the asteroid ( 6 )  hebe ) , but none of them has been unambiguously confirmed .",
    "the model presented by _ nesvorn et  al . _",
    "( 2009 ) , while more educated in the choice of the l - chondrite source region than the previous work of _ vokrouhlick and farinella _ ( 2000 ) , requires immediate parent bodies of these meteorites , @xmath257  m in size , to reach the powerful 3/1 mean motion resonance with jupiter .",
    "this means they should have migrated by the yarkovsky effect some @xmath258  au from their source location in less than half a billion years .",
    "while this is not a problem in a scenario where the bodies rotate about the body - fixed axis whose direction is preserved in the inertial space , it is not clear if this holds when the bodies would start to tumble or their axes to evolve rapidly due to the yorp effect .",
    "clearly , more work is needed to understand the yarkovsky effect in the small - size limit for bodies whose spin axis may undergo fast evolution .      over the past decade",
    "the yarkovsky and yorp effects have helped to significantly boost our knowledge of the asteroid families ( e.g. , _ nesvorn et  al .",
    "_ , this volume ) .",
    "this is because they represent a unique time - dependent process in modeling their structure , allowing thus for the first time to constrain their ages .",
    "the most accurate results are obtained for young - enough families ( ages @xmath259  m.y . ,",

    "( 2002 , 2003 ) , the basic tool to determine the origin of the family is provided by the convergence of orbital secular angles ( the nodal and pericenter longitudes @xmath260 and @xmath261 ) at some moment in the past . because the rate at which these angles precess in space depends sensitively on the semimajor axis value , the past values of @xmath260 and @xmath261 of the family members depend on their yarkovsky drift - rates @xmath42 .",
    "this contribution may not be negligible , because the changes in precession rates produce effects that grow quadratically in time ( the same way as described in secs .",

    "thus _ nesvorn and bottke _ ( 2004 ) were able to significantly improve the uncertainty in the age of the karin family by including the yarkovsky effect in their model .",
    "at the same time , this work provided an effective detection of the yarkovsky effect for the main belt asteroids .",
    "this technique has been later used for age constrains of several other young families ( e.g. , _ novakovi _ , 2010 ; _ novakovi et  al .",

    "it is not surprising that the yarkovsky effect again plays important role in this effort .",
    "the best cases , such as the pair ( 6070 )  rheinland and ( 54827 ) 2001  nq8 , allow one to also infer constraints on the obliquities of the individual components , consequently providing predictions directly testable by further observations ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick and nesvorn _",

    "_ , 2011 ) .",
    "older asteroid families ( ages @xmath262  m.y . , say ) do not permit application of the fine age - determination methods described in sec .",
    "this is because orbits in the main asteroid belt are affected by deterministic chaos over long timescales .",
    "hence it is not possible to reliably reconstruct past values of the orbital secular angles , with the proper values of semimajor axis @xmath263 , eccentricity @xmath264 and inclination @xmath265 being the only well - defined parameters at hand . still , these proper elements are constructed using approximate dynamical models , spanning time intervals quite shorter than the typical ages of large asteroid families .",
    "while the deterministic chaos is still in action over long timescales and produces a slow diffusion of the proper @xmath264 and @xmath265 values , the yarkovsky effect is the principal phenomenon that changes the proper @xmath263 values of multi - kilometer - size asteroids .",

    "it stems from the observation that small asteroids in some families are pushed towards extreme values of the semimajor axis and , if plotted in the @xmath263 vs @xmath245 ( absolute magnitude ) diagram , they acquire an `` eared '' structure ( fig .",
    "[ feri ] ) . since this peculiar structure is not compatible with a direct emplacement by any reasonable ejection field , _ vokrouhlick et  al . _",
    "( 2006a ) argued it must result from a long - term dynamical evolution of the family .",
    "in particular , postulating that the initial dispersal in @xmath263 of the family members was actually small , they showed that yarkovsky drift itself accounted for most of the family s extension in semimajor axis .",
    "assisted by the yorp effect , which over a yorp - cycle timescale tilts obliquities toward extreme values , the yarkovsky effect ( dominated by its diurnal component ) is maximized , and pushes small family members towards the extreme values in @xmath263 .",
    "if properly modeled , this method allows to approximately constrain the interval of time needed since the family - forming event to reach the observed extension ( fig .",
    "[ feri ] ) .",
    "several applications of this method can be found in _",

    "( 2015 ) noticed that the classical setting of this method does not permit a satisfactory solution for the low - albedo , inner - belt eulalia family .",
    "their proposed modification requires an extended time spent by small asteroids in the extreme obliquity state , which in turn requires a simultaneous slow - down in the evolution of their rotation rates by the yorp effect .",
    "in fact , this may be readily obtained by postulating that the yorp strength changes on a timescale shorter than the yorp cycle , an assumption that may follow from the extreme sensitivity of the yorp effect to asteroid shape ( the self - limitation effect discussed in sec .",
    "2.1 , also _ cotto - figueroa et  al .",
    "_ , 2015 ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , why this phenomenon should manifest itself primarily in this particular family , or whether it generally concerns all families with @xmath267  b.y .",
    "the model of _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ inherently contains a prediction that the small members in the `` eared '' families have preferred obliquity values ( such that prograde - rotating objects occupy regions in the family with largest @xmath0 values , and vice versa ) .",
    "interestingly , recent works of _ hanu et  al . _",

    "a peculiar situation arises for families embedded in the first - order mean motion resonances with jupiter . in these cases ,",
    "the resonant lock prohibits large changes in the semimajor axis , but the yarkovsky effect manifests itself by a secular increase or decrease of the eccentricity .",

    "( 2011 ) to estimate the age of the schubart and hilda families located in the 3/2 mean motion resonance with jupiter .        as explained in sec .  2.1 ,",
    "a secular change in rotation rate and obliquity are the two main dynamical implications of the yorp effect .",
    "therefore , it is has been natural to seek traits of these trends among the populations of small asteroids .",
    "luckily , the amount of data and their quality have significantly increased over the last decade and allowed such analyses .",
    "* rotation - rate distribution. * the distribution of rotation frequencies of large asteroids in the main belt matches a maxwellian function quite well with a mean rotation period of @xmath268  hr , depending on the size of the bin used .",
    "however , data for asteroids smaller than @xmath269  km show significant deviations from this law , with many asteroids either having very slow or very fast rotation rates .",
    "note that similar data are also available for near - earth asteroids , but the main belt sample is more suitable because its interpretation is not complicated by possible effects of planetary close approaches . after eliminating known or suspected binary systems , solitary kilometer - size asteroids in the main asteroid belt were shown to have a roughly uniform distribution of rotation frequencies ( _ pravec et  al .",
    "_ , 2008 , and fig .  [ fo ] ) .",
    "the only statistically significant deviation was an excess of slow rotators ( periods less than a day or so ) .",
    "note that the sample described by _",
    "pravec et  al . _",
    "( 2008 ) is superior to other existing datasets so far in elimination of all possible survey biases ( which may prevent recognition of slow rotators ; p.  pravec , private communication ) .",
    "these results are well explained with a simple model of a relaxed yorp evolution . in this view",
    "asteroid spin rates are driven by the yorp effect toward extreme ( large or small ) values on a characteristic ( yorp- ) timescale dependent on the size .",
    "asteroids evolving toward a state of rapid rotation shed mass and thus put a brake on their rotation rate , while those who slow their rotation too much enter into a tumbling phase .",
    "they may later emerge from this state naturally , with a new spin vector , or may gain rotation angular momentum by sub - catastrophic impacts .",
    "after a few cycles the spin rates settle to an approximately uniform distribution and the memory of its initial value is erased .",
    "in fact , the observations similar to those shown in fig .  [ fo ] may help to quantitatively calibrate the processes that allow bodies to re - emerge from the slow - rotating state .",
    "_ statler et  al . _",
    "( 2013 ) presented a first attempt to obtain unbiased rotation properties of very small near - earth asteroids .",
    "they found an anomalously large fraction of very fast rotating bodies in the group having size @xmath270  m , which may witness a preferential ability of yorp to accelerate small - asteroids rotation rate .",
    "a larger sample , less vulnerable to potential errors and biases , will be needed to verify this potentially important result .",
    "* obliquity distribution. * similarly , the distribution of pole orientation of large asteroids in the main belt is roughly isotropic , with only a moderate excess of prograde rotating bodies .",
    "on the other hand , rotation poles of small asteroids ( sizes @xmath271  km ) are strongly concentrated toward ecliptic south and north poles ( _ hanu et  al .",
    "_ , 2013a , and fig .  [ fg ] ) .",
    "note that this trend is better exhibited in the retrograde - rotating group ( obliquities @xmath272 ) , because the prograde - rotating asteroids are perturbed by secular spin - orbit resonances ( e.g. , _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ , 2006d ) . as a result",
    ", there is more mixing among the obliquities @xmath273 which causes their flatter distribution in fig .",
    "overall , this result can again be matched with the above - mentioned simple model of yorp evolution , because yorp torques drive obliquity toward its extreme values ( e.g. , _ apek and vokrouhlick _ , 2004 ) .",
    "the pole distribution of near - earth asteroids , in spite of a still limited sample , indicates a strong preference of directions near the south ecliptic pole ( _ la spina et  al .",
    "_ , 2004 , and fig .  [ fg ] ) .",
    "the ratio between the number of retrograde vs prograde rotating bodies is nearly 3:1 .",
    "this is in a very good agreement with prediction from a model , where most of near - earth asteroids are delivered from the main belt via principal resonant routes , secular @xmath256 resonance and 3/1 mean motion resonance with jupiter ( _ bottke et  al .",
    "_ , 2002b ) , resupplied by the yarkovsky effect ( _ morbidelli and vokrouhlick _ , 2003 ) .",
    "this is because while the 3/1 resonance may be reached from heliocentric orbits with both larger and smaller value of the semimajor axis , asteroids can enter the @xmath256 resonance only by decreasing their semimajor axis . taking into account the proportion by which these resonances contribute to the near - earth asteroid population ( _ bottke et  al .",
    "_ , 2002b ) , one obtains the observed 3:1 ratio between spin retrograde vs prograde rotators .",
    "this obviously assumes , the rotation pole directions do not become significantly modified after the asteroids enter the planet - crossing zone .    another interesting piece of information comes from a study of orbital pole distribution of small binary systems in the main belt . _ pravec et  al . _",
    "( 2012 ) show that poles of these systems are non - isotropic with strong concentration toward the ecliptic poles , mimicking thus the spin distribution of solitary asteroids in the same class .",
    "this picture is consistent with a model in which these small binaries are formed by fission of the parent body , whose rotation has been brought to the rotational limit by the yorp effect .      in an attempt to generalize cassini s second and third laws",
    ", giuseppe colombo developed a mathematical model in the 1960 s that describes the evolution of a body s spin axis rotating about a principal axis of its inertia tensor ( _ colombo _ , 1966 ) .",
    "colombo included two fundamental elements in his approach : ( i ) gravitational torques due to a massive center ( e.g. , sun ) , and ( ii ) regular precession of the orbital plane of the body by exterior perturbers ( e.g. , planets ) .",
    "because ( i ) produces a regular precession of the spin axis , a secular spin - orbit resonance ( with a stable fixed point called cassini state  2 ) may occur between its frequency and the frequency by which the orbital plane precesses in the inertial space .",
    "such a resonance may occur only for a certain range of obliquity and rotation period values , and thus there is only a small probability that the spin state of any given asteroid is located in the cassini state  2 associated with one of the frequencies by which its orbital plane precesses in space .    with this as background",
    ", the discovery of five prograde - rotating koronis member asteroids with similar spin vectors ( i.e. , spin axes nearly parallel in inertial space and similar rotation periods ) was a surprise . additionally , the sample of retrograde - rotating asteroids in the same observation campaign showed obliquities anomalously large ( @xmath274 ) and either short or long rotation periods ( _ slivan _ , 2002 ; _ slivan et  al .",
    "_ , 2009 ) .",
    "this puzzling situation , however , was solved with a model where the gravitational spin dynamics was complemented with the long - term effects of yorp torques ( _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ , 2003 ) .",
    "the yorp effect was shown to bring , on a @xmath275  gy timescale , prograde states close to cassini state  2 associated with the prominent @xmath276 frequency in the orbital precession , providing thus a natural explanation for the alignment in inertial space .",
    "note that while the capture is fundamentally unstable , the evolution becomes slowed down near the observed obliquities where the yorp effect changes rotation period only slowly ( sec .",
    "no resonant trapping zone exists for retrograde - rotating bodies , whose evolution is thus simpler and , driven solely by the yorp effect , evolve toward extreme values in both their obliquities and rotation periods .",
    "the possibility exists for asteroid spin states to be trapped in similar spin - orbit resonant states , dubbed `` slivan states '' , for bodies residing on low - inclination orbits , especially in the central and outer parts of the main asteroid belt .",
    "recently reported slivan states in the inner part of the belt , namely in the flora region ( _ kryszczyska _ , 2013 ) , are questionable because of their instability . yet",
    ", model refinment would be clearly needed if more bodies are observed near these states in the flora region .",
    "the byorp effect is predicted to play a fundamental role in the evolution of asteroid binaries .",
    "as noted earlier , it has been hypothesized that nearly all observed small , rubble - pile binary asteroid systems lie in an equilibrium state where byorp and tidal torques are balanced .",
    "the byorp effect plays many other roles in controlling the evolution of a binary asteroid . _",
    "jacobson and scheeres _ ( 2011a ) studied the evolution of asteroid systems arising from the rotational fission of a primary body ( due to yorp torques ) . while the initial creation of a stable binary system is a complex process ( _ walsh et al . _ , this volume ) , once a stable binary forms with at least one of the bodies being synchronous , the byorp effect can take control of its subsequent evolution .",
    "there are several different pathways , which we briefly review here .",
    "first , if the ratio between the secondary and primary is greater than @xmath277 , the system is expected to eventually settle into a double - synchronous binary asteroid such as ( 69230 )  hermes . in this configuration both of the synchronous bodies",
    "can contribute to the byorp effect , either working together to contract or expand the system , or working against each other .",
    "in none of these cases is it expected that the system will settle into a stable equilibrium , as only if the two byorp effects counteract each other exactly would migration stop .",
    "similarly , there are no significant tidal dissipation effects once a system is doubly - synchronous , and thus the case of contraction will lead directly to collapse ( e.g. , _ taylor and margot _ , 2014 ) . the expansion phase of a doubly - synchronous binary asteroid has not been investigated in detail as of yet in terms of physical evolution . however , as the system becomes larger it should be more susceptible to other exogenous perturbations ( e.g. , _ fang and margot _ , 2012 ) .    for stable binaries that have a mass ratio @xmath278 between the secondary and primary , the evolutionary path is seen to be quite different ( see also _",
    "walsh et al .",
    "_ , this volume ) .",
    "if a stable binary is formed , it is generally a singly - synchronous system with the secondary in a synchronous state and the primary rotating faster than the spin rate .",
    "if the secondary s byorp coefficient is negative and the system contracts , then it should migrate into a byorp - tide equilibrium .",
    "once in this state it may persist for long periods of time , as the system has been hardened against exogenous perturbations due to its more compact state ( e.g. , _ fang and margot _ , 2012 ) .",
    "a noticeable outcome is that the primary body should lose spin rate , due to the tidal transfer of torque .",
    "however , the primary may still be subject to the yorp effect and thus may not exhibit a clear slowing of its spin rate",
    ".    if the secondary s byorp coefficient is positive the system expands , with tides now working in the same direction . in this case",
    "there is also an interesting interplay between the libration of the secondary about its synchronous state and tidal dissipation that acts to damp out such librations . in the expansive case without librational",
    "damping , the amplitude of libration is expected to increase as the orbit increases , due to an adiabatic integral involving the libration state ( e.g. , _ jacobson et  al .",
    "_ , 2014 ) .",
    "how these two effects combine can control when the secondary can lose synchronous lock , causing the byorp effect to shut down . the model and simulations developed in _ jacobson et al . _",
    "( 2014 ) indicate that synchronicity is lost at a far enough distance so that further tidal evolution of the system does not occur , and the system can be described as a wide - asynchronous binary .",
    "this paper makes favorable comparisons between predictions of the theory and such observed binary systems .",
    "an alternate , earlier theory was proposed by _ uk and nesvorn _ ( 2010 ) in which the expanding system can become trapped in a resonance with the eccentricity of the orbit growing secularly .",
    "they hypothesized that such a system would then lose synchronicity , but subsequently relax back into synchronous rotation several times until the system enters a contractive phase .",
    "the very different predictions from these models indicate that the full interaction of such expanding binary systems is not yet fully understood .",
    "in addition to expansion and contraction effects , there may also be out of plane byorp effects that cause migration of the binary system s orbit pole , similar to the yorp effect ( see already _ uk and burns _ , 2005 ) . _",
    "steinberg and sari _ ( 2011 ) further studied these situations and proposed that , similar to yorp , the obliquity states should preferentially migrate towards some asymptotic values ( either @xmath16 , @xmath19 or @xmath17 in their model ) . _ uk _ ( 2007 ) noted that this effect , when combined with the characteristic zero - crossing of the byorp coefficient as a function of obliquity , could create an accumulation of binaries at obliquities between these limits .",
    "it should also be mentioned that _ mcmahon and scheeres _ ( 2010b ) did not predict an inclination evolution due to the byorp effect , due to the effects of the primary oblateness .",
    "thus , it is apparent that the obliquity migration of a binary orbit due to byorp is not fully understood or settled , and remains a ripe topic for further investigation .      as it is with many mature disciplines in science , studies of the yarkovsky and yorp effects have their own agenda of development in the future years .",
    "what makes them even more appealing is that some of these future results have interesting implications for other domains in planetary astronomy .",
    "here we try to summarize at least a few examples .    while it seems nearly certain that numerous detections of the yarkovsky effect will emerge from current and upcoming astrometric surveys in the next decade ( e.g. , _ delb et  al .",
    "_ , 2008 ; _ mouret and mignard _ , 2011",
    "; _ nugent et  al . _ , 2012b ; _ desmars _ , 2015 ) , more work is needed to secure yorp detections , especially across the whole range of possible rotation periods .",
    "this should help us understand in what proportion the yorp effect results in acceleration or deceleration of the rotation rate .",
    "the binary yorp detections are in their infancy but will become an important topic of future research . this is because the byorp effect is an essential element , as far as we understand it today , in orbital evolution of binary asteroids .",
    "detections , or continuing non - detections , of the expected byorp signal will have implications not only for the orbital evolution pathways of binaries and their physical parameters , but also for estimates of their lifetime and formation rate .    as asteroids rotations become slower by the yorp effect , they naturally enter the tumbling state .",
    "the available models so far , whether analytical or numerical in nature ( _ vokrouhlick et  al .",
    "_ , 2007 ; _ cical and scheeres _ , 2010 ; _ breiter et  al . _ , 2011 ) , indicate that the yorp effect keeps navigating the rotation through the tumbling phase space without an easy return to the rotation about the shortest axis of the inertia tensor . yet",
    ", more than 90% of asteroids do rotate in the shortest - axis mode .",
    "solution of this conundrum is not clear yet and warrants further work .",
    "the above mentioned models of the yorp effect in the tumbling regime neglect thermal inertia , which may be an important factor . additionally , no detailed model combining the yorp effect and the effects of inelastic energy dissipation inside the body has been presented ( though the initial work does not seem to remedy the problem ; s.  breiter , private communication ) .    while it is generally accepted that the yorp effect is the driving dynamical process that brings small asteroids to their fission , more work is needed to understand how the fission mechanics really works . along the path to the fission limit , the body may undergo structural and shape changes that could either help the fission process , or potentially invert the yorp acceleration effectively prevent fission .",
    "it is not known which of these alternatives typically dominates and in what proportion .",
    "this , again , could have important implications for the formation rate of both small binaries and asteroid pairs . additionally",
    ", this would help better understand the yorp self - limitation processes and the way how they potentially modify classical yorp results .    * acknowledgments . *",
