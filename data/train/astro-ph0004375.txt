    "@xcite , zdunik & haensel @xcite ) was related to the announcement reporting the detection of the half millisecond pulsar in 1989 ( which after one year turned out to be erroneous ) .",
    "this observation stimulated detailed investigations of the limits on the rotational frequency of dense stars which excluded nearly all neutron stars models leaving strange stars as a possible explanation .",
    "at present the increasing interest in strange stars is a result of qpos observations in low - mass x - ray binaries lmbx and some difficulties with the explanations of its properties by neutron star models under the assumption that qpos represent keplerian frequencies of the particles in an accretion disk ( kaaret et al .",

    "frieman & olinto ( @xcite ) mentioned the approximation of the eos of strange matter by the linear function ( see also prakash et al .",
    "i present here the linear form of the eos of strange matter with parameters expressed as a polynomial functions of the physical constants describing mit bag model ( strange quark mass and qcd coupling constant ) .",
    "these approximate formulae allow us to write down the pressure vs. density dependence in a simple form @xmath2 .",
    "the consequence of this form are scaling laws of all stellar quantities with appropriate powers of @xmath3 .",
    "this linear eos is complete in the sense that it contains not only pressure and energy density , which enter the relativistic stress - energy tensor and are sufficient for the determination of the main parameters of the star ( mass , radius ) , but also the formula for baryon number density ( or equivalently baryon chemical potential ) , necessary in the microscopic stability considerations and determination of the total baryon number of the star .",
    "we describe the quark matter using the phenomenological mit bag model ( see , e.g. , baym , @xcite ) . the quark matter is the mixture of the massless @xmath4 and @xmath5 quarks , electrons and massive @xmath6 quarks . the model is described in detail in farhi & jaffe ( @xcite ) , where the formulae for physical parameters of a strange matter are also presented .",
    "there are the following physical quantities entering this model : @xmath7  the bag constant , @xmath8  the qcd coupling constant and @xmath9  the mass of the strange quark .",

    "the dependence of all parameters on @xmath7 is very well defined and one can take this into account using simple scaling laws .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to study the eos in two parameter space : @xmath8 and @xmath9 for chosen value of @xmath12 and then obtain results for other @xmath7 from eqs ( [ scleos ] ) .    strictly speaking the scaling relations ( [ scleos ] )",
    "hold exactly for the parameter @xmath10 rescaled by the relation @xmath15 .",
    "however the renormalization point is fixed and this is the source of small discrepancy between the true results for different values of bag constant and the scaling relations presented in this paper .",

    "these scaling laws so far have been mainly exploited in the case of maximum mass of the star ( or equivalently maximum rotational frequency ) .",
    "of course these relations refer to all stellar configurations ( e.g. the curve @xmath39 ) and as an interesting example we can consider the point defined by the equality : @xmath40 which corresponds to the maximum possible frequency of a particle in stable circular orbit @xmath41 around nonrotating star . because the scaling properties of @xmath38 and @xmath24 are the same ( @xmath42 ) one can solve the eq .",

    "must be observed at frequencies larger than @xmath50  khz .",

    "the absolute maximum qpo frequency that can be accommodated by strange stars ranges from 1.7 to 2.4  khz depending on the values of a strange matter parameters : strange quark mass and qcd coupling constant .",
