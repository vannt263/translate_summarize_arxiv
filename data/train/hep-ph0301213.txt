    "a relativistic treatment is one of the essential ingredients that should be incorporated in describing hadronic systems .",
    "the hadrons have an intrinsically relativistic nature since the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) governing the quarks and gluons inside the hadrons has _ a priori _ a strong interaction coupling and the characteristic momenta of quarks and gluons are of the same order , or even very much larger , than the masses of the particles involved .",
    "it has also been realized that a parametrization of nuclear reactions in terms of non - relativistic wave functions must fail . in principle , a manifestly covariant framework such as the bethe - salpeter approach and its covariant equivalents can be taken for the description of hadrons . however , in practice , such tools are intractable because of the relative time dependence and the difficulty of systematically including higher order kernels .",
    "a different and more intuitive framework is the relativistic hamiltonian approach . with the recent advances in the hamiltonian renormalization program , a promising technique to impose",
    "the relativistic treatment of hadrons appears to be light - front dynamics ( lfd ) , in which a fock - space expansion of bound states is made at equal light - front time @xmath2 . the reasons that make lfd so attractive to solve bound - state problems in field theory",
    "make it also useful for a relativistic description of nuclear systems .",
    "light - front quantization @xcite has already been applied successfully in the context of current algebra @xcite and the parton model @xcite in the past . for the analysis of exclusive processes involving hadrons , the framework of light - front ( lf ) quantization  @xcite is also one of the most popular formulations . in particular , the light - front or drell - yan - west ( @xmath3 )",
    "frame has been extensively used in the calculation of various electroweak form factors and decay processes  @xcite . in this frame",
    "@xcite , one can derive a first - principle formulation for the exclusive amplitudes by choosing judiciously the component of the light - front current .",
    "as an example , only the parton - number - conserving ( valence ) fock state contribution is needed in @xmath4 frame when a  good \" component of the current , @xmath5 or @xmath6 , is used for the spacelike electromagnetic form factor calculation of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "one does nt need to suffer from complicated vacuum fluctuations in the equal-@xmath2 formulation due to the rational dispersion relation .",
    "the zero - mode contribution may also be avoided in drell - yan - west ( dyw ) frame by using the plus component of current  @xcite . the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) factorization theorem for the exclusive amplitudes at asymptotically large momentum transfer",
    "can also be proved in lfd formulated in the dyw frame .",
    "however , caution is needed in applying the established drell - yan - west formalism to other frames because the current components do mix under the transformation of the reference - frame  @xcite . especially , for the spin systems , the light - front helicity states are in general different from the ordinary ( or canonical ) helicity states which may be more appropriate degrees of freedom to discuss the angular momentum conservation .",
    "as the spin of the system becomes larger , the number of current matrix elements gets larger than the number of physical form factors and the conditions that the current matrix elements must satisfy are essential to test the underlying theoretical model for the hadrons .",
    "thus , it is crucial to find the relations between the ordinary helicity amplitudes and the light - front helicity amplitudes in the frame that they are computed .    in this work",
    ", we use the general collinear frames which cover both breit and target - rest frames to find the relations between the ordinary helicity amplitudes and the light - front helicity amplitudes . using the conservation of angular momentum",
    ", we derive a general angular condition which can be applied for any spin system .",
    "the relations among the light - front helicity amplitudes are further constrained by the light - front parity and time - reversal consideration .",
    "for example , the spin-1 form factor analysis requires in general nine light - front helicity amplitudes although there are only three physical form factors .",
    "thus , there must be six conditions for the helicity amplitudes . using the light - front parity relation",
    ", one can reduce the number of helicity amplitudes down to five .",
    "the general angular condition gives one relation among the five light - front helicity amplitudes , leaving four of them independent .",
    "one more relation comes by applying the light - front time - reversal relation , also having the effect that the general anglar conditon can be reduced to the usual angular condition relating only four helicity ampituds .",
    "consequently , only three helicity amplitudes are independent each other , as it should be because there are only three physical form factors in spin-1 systems .",
    "we also apply the general angular condition to the electromagnetic transition between spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 systems and find the relation among the helicity amplitudes that can be used in the analysis of the n-@xmath1 transition .",
    "in particular , the angular condition provides a strong constraint to the n-@xmath1 transition indicating that the suppression of the helicity flip amplitude with respect to the helicity non - flip amplitude for the momentum transfer @xmath7 in pqcd is in an order of @xmath8 or @xmath9 rather than @xmath10 , where both nucleon mass @xmath11 and delta mass @xmath12 are much larger than the qcd scale @xmath13 .",
    "thus , one may expect that the applicability of leading pqcd could be postponed to a larger @xmath0 region than one may naively anticipate from leading pqcd .",
    "the same consideration can apply for the deuteron form factor analysis from the spin-1 angular condition .",
    "this work presents further discussions on the scaling law and the subleading power corrections in the breit and light - front frames .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ( section ii ) , we present the derivation of transformation laws between the ordinary helicity amplitudes and the light - front helicity amplitudes and obtain a general angular condition on the current matrix elements using the rotational covariance of the current operator . since we start from the definition of states in a general collinear frame , our derivation may be more physically transparent than any other formal derivation . in section iii",
    ", we present the light - front discrete symmetries and derive the parity and time - reversal rules for the helicity amplitudes . in section iv , we discuss the consequences from these findings of the general angular condition and the light - front discrete symmetry relations . the reduction of number of independent helicity amplitudes is shown for a few example spin systems .",
    "the current matrix elements of the spin-1 system and the spin-1/2 to spin-3/2 transition are shown as explicit examples .",
    "the subleading power corrections are obtained from the general angular condition and the scaling laws are derived for the ordinary breit frame helicity amplitudes and the light - front helicity amplitudes .",
    "summary and conclusion follow in section v.",
    "our subject is relations among matrix elements or helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is an off - shell photon of momentum @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are hadrons with momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "( results will be easily extendable for other incoming vector bosons . )",
    "calculations may be done in the light - front frame , which is characterized by having @xmath21 , and may be done in the breit frame , which is characterized by having the photon and hadron 3-momenta along a single line .",
    "each frame has its advantages . in the light front frame with @xmath22 , and for matrix elements of the current component @xmath5 , the photon only couples to forward moving constituents ( quarks ) of the hadrons and",
    "never produces a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "thus one only needs wave functions for hadrons turning into constituents going forward in ( light - front ) time , and can develop a simple parton picture of the interaction . on the other hand , the breit frame , being a collinear frame , makes it easy to add up the helicities of the incoming and outgoing particles and to count the number of independent non - zero amplitudes .    by transforming",
    "efficiently back and forth one can realize the advantages of both frames .",
    "hence our first goal in this section will be to find the relations between the light - front and breit frame helicity amplitudes , and then to use those relations to derive in a transparent way the general relation among the light - front amplitudes that is usually referred to as the `` angular condition . ''      connecting light - front and breit helicity amplitudes is facilitated by finding frames that are both simultaneously realized .",
    "one excellent and easy example is the particular light - front frame where the target is at rest .",
    "this is also a breit frame , since with the target 3-momentum zero , the remaining momenta must lie along the same line .",
    "we are perhaps extending the idea of a breit frame , but are doing so in a way that leaves invariant the breit frame helicity amplitude .",
    "that is , one normally thinks of a breit frame as one where the incoming and outgoing hadron have oppositely directed momenta , along the same line .",
    "sometimes one specifies that the line is the @xmath23-axis .",
    "however , since helicities are unaffected by rotations  @xcite , one can choose any line at all .",
    "further , helicities are unaffected by collinear boosts  @xcite that do nt change the particle s momentum direction .",
    "one can also boost along the direction of motion until one of the hadrons is at rest , provided one defines the positive helicity direction for the particle at rest to be parallel to the momentum the particle would have in conventional breit frame . with this natural helicity direction choice ,",
    "the breit frame helicity amplitude in a target rest frame is ( if we use relativistic normalization conventions , as we shall always do ) precisely the same as the breit frame amplitude in a conventional breit frame with the same helicity labels .",
    "thus , the light - front frame with the target at rest is both a breit frame and a light - front frame .",
    "there is a continuum of such frames .",
    "another useful example is a breit frame with the incoming and outgoing hadrons moving in the negative and positive @xmath24-directions , adjusted to have equal incoming and outgoing energies . in this case ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are individually zero , so that @xmath4 and we have also a light - front frame .    even in a frame that is simultaneously light - front and breit , the connection between the two types of helicity amplitudes can be a bit involved .",
    "this is because the definitions of the light - front and ordinary helicity states are not the same and the general conversion between them for a moving state involves a rotation by an angle that is not trivial to determine .    our plan will be to use the rest of this subsection to define our notation , state the main result for the light - front to breit and vice - versa helicity amplitude conversion formulas , and show how one obtains the general angular condition from this result .",
    "then in the next subsection , we will give the details of the derivation .    for light - front amplitudes",
    "one uses light - front helicity states , which for a momentum @xmath19 are defined by taking a state at rest with the spin projection along the @xmath23-direction equal to the desired helicity , then boosting in the @xmath23-direction to get the desired @xmath27 , and then doing a light - front transverse boost to get the desired transverse momentum @xmath28 .",
    "we call this state @xmath29    and it is defined by formula in the next subsection",
    ". the spin of the particle , @xmath30 , is understood but not usually written , @xmath31 is the light - front helicity of the particle , and the normalization is @xmath32    the light - front helicity amplitude @xmath33 is a matrix element of the electromagnetic current @xmath34 given by @xmath35    in the breit frame , we use ordinary helicity states , which are defined by starting with a state at rest having a spin projection along the @xmath23-direction equal to the desired helicity , then boosting in the @xmath23-direction to get the desired @xmath36 , and then rotating to get the momentum and spin projection in the desired direction .",
    "( we shall generally keep our momenta in the @xmath24-@xmath23 plane , so we do not need to worry about the distinction between , for example , the jacob - wick  @xcite helicity states and the somewhat later wick states  @xcite . )",
    "the state will be denoted , @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the helicity or spin projection in the direction of motion , and the subscript `` @xmath39 '' reminds us which frame we use these states in . except for momenta directly along the @xmath23-axis , the light - front helicity and regular helicity states are not the same , but if the 4-momenta are the same they can be related by a rotation .",
    "the breit frame helicity amplitude @xmath40 is , @xmath41    where @xmath34 is the same electromagnetic current .",
    "a main result is the relation between @xmath33 and @xmath40 , which is @xmath42    a sum on repeated helicity indices is implied .",
    "the @xmath43-functions are the usual representations of rotations about the @xmath44-axis for particles whose spins are given by the superscript .",
    "the angles are given by @xmath45    and @xmath46    where @xmath11 is the mass of the incoming hadron , @xmath12 is the mass of the outgoing hadron , @xmath47 , @xmath48    and @xmath49    and we assume that @xmath50 is spacelike ( negative , in our metric ) . for the elastic case , @xmath51 , the angles @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same .",
    "( it may seem peculiar to have a minus sign inserted twice , as it appears in eqs .",
    "( [ main ] ) and  ( [ thetaprime ] ) , but it will seem more sensible when one sees how the angles arise , in the next subsection . )    in the breit frame , since it is collinear , the sum of spin projections along the direction of motion must be conserved , so that if @xmath54 is the helicity of the photon , @xmath55    even if the photon is off - shell , it can not have more than one unit of helicity in magnitude . hence there is a constraint on the breit frame helicity amplitude , @xmath56    this induces a constraint on the light front amplitudes , and this constraint is what is called the angular condition , given generally by  @xcite @xmath57    and most often applied when the lorentz index @xmath58 is @xmath59 .",
    "one sees that the result follows from angular momentum conservation and the limited helicity of the photon .",
    "we will check in section  [ consequences ] that upon expressing the @xmath43-functions in terms of @xmath0 and mass , one obtains the known angular condition for electron - deuteron elastic scattering , and will we also obtain in terms of masses and @xmath0 the angular condition for the n-@xmath60 electromagnetic transition .",
    "we gave two examples of frames that were simultaneously breit and light - front frames .",
    "it turns out that half the work we need to do is very easy in one of these frames , and that visualizing one ensuing equality is quite easy in the other .",
    "clearly , one can write @xmath61    so that the problem reduces to finding the overlaps of the light - front helicity and ordinary helicity amplitudes .    we shall start using the light - front frame with the target at rest .",
    "for the initial state , being at rest , the light - front helicity state is identical to the state with spin quantized in the positive @xmath23-direction , @xmath62    the helicity state , however , should be quantized along a direction antiparallel to the momentum of the entering photon ; see fig .",
    "the photon four - momentum is @xmath63    and it makes an angle @xmath52 with the @xmath23-axis , where @xmath64    equivalent to the half - angle version given earlier , eq .",
    "( [ thetahalf ] ) . with",

    "one has @xmath74    where @xmath75    and @xmath76 is the light - front transverse boost @xmath77    thus the overlap is @xmath78    where we know the product of the four operators can only be a rotation because the rest four momentum is undisturbed .",
    "consistent with our previous choice , we define @xmath79 as the angle rotating from the rest state connected to the breit frame helicity state to the corresonding state connected to the light - front state .",
    "our method for finding @xmath79 is to choose a representation for the operators , namely @xmath80    where the @xmath81 are the usual @xmath82 pauli matrices , and then to multiply the operators out explicitly .",

    "the scaling behavior at high @xmath7 is @xmath184    where @xmath185 is the number of quarks in the state , @xmath11 is a mass scale , and @xmath186 is the minimum helicity of the incoming or outgoing state ( i.e. , 0 or 1/2 for bosons or fermions , respectively ) .    regarding the breit frame , we have thus far given its helicity amplitudes in terms of @xmath187 where @xmath58 is a lorentz index .",
    "it is usual to substitute a photon helicity index for the lorentz index , using ( for incoming photons ) @xmath188    with polarizations ( in @xmath189-type notation ) @xmath190    where @xmath52 is the angle between @xmath191 and the negative @xmath23-direction , as shown in fig .",
    "one can work out that @xmath192 \\ , \\ ] ]    so that @xmath193 \\",
    ", \\ ] ]    where the superscripts on @xmath40 will in the rest of this subsection refer to photon helicity unless explicitly stated otherwise . with the general relation , eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) , this gives directly the expression we use to obtain the scaling behavior of the breit amplitudes , @xmath194    we can select terms on the left - hand - side by choice of @xmath134 and @xmath38 , since breit amplitudes are non - zero only for @xmath195 .",
    "the @xmath43-functions can be written in terms of sines and cosines of half angles , so we record that at high @xmath7 , @xmath196    where @xmath11 inside the @xmath197 symbol is a generic mass scale .",
    "the @xmath43-functions can be expanded as  @xcite @xmath198    where @xmath199 are numerical coefficients with @xmath200 .",
    "thus for large @xmath7 , @xmath201    on the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ expression ] ) , there is no term that falls slower than the term that has @xmath202 , and @xmath203 .",
    "thus the breit amplitude leading falloff at high @xmath7 is @xmath204    these are the same results one can get by directly analyzing amplitudes in the breit frame for various photon helicities  @xcite .    by way of example , we will give the breit and light - front frame helicity amplitudes for elastic electron - nucleon scattering . in terms of the standard dirac , pauli , and sachs form factors",
    "one may work out @xmath205    for the light - front states and @xmath206    for the breit frame states .",
    "the scaling rules predict that @xmath161 , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 scale as @xmath175 and that @xmath209 scales as @xmath180 , consistent with the relations @xmath210    ( there is recent data  @xcite and commentary  @xcite on the helicity flip scaling results . )",
    "the purpose of the present paper has been largely kinematical .",
    "we have examined the relationship between the helicity amplitudes in the breit and light - front frames .",
    "one particular result has been a clear view of where the angular condition comes from .",
    "the angular condition is a constraint on light - front helicity amplitudes .",
    "it follows from applying angular momentum conservation in the breit frame , where the application of angular momentum conservation to the helicity amplitudes is elementary .",
    "one consequence is that an amplitude must be zero if it requires the photon to have more than one unit magnitude of helicity , and this statement cast in terms of light - front amplitudes is the angular condition  @xcite .",
    "another set of constraints follows from parity and time - reversal invariance .",
    "neither of these symmetries can be used directly on the light - front because the light - front has a preferred spatial direction .",
    "however , each of them can be modified to give a valid symmetry operation ( at least for strong and electromagnetic interactions ) for the light - front  @xcite . to define a light - front parity ,",
    "choose the @xmath24-@xmath23 plane to contain all the momenta and then consider mirror reflection in the @xmath24-@xmath23 plane .",
    "this reflection leaves the momenta unchanged but reverses the helicities  @xcite .",
    "technically , it is the same as ordinary parity followed by a 180@xmath86 rotation about the @xmath44-axis , and helicity amplitude relations that follow from it were given in section  [ discrete ] .",
    "similarly one defines light - front time reversal as ordinary time reversal followed by the 180@xmath86 rotaton about the @xmath44-axis .",
    "time reversal invariance implies that the amplitudes are always real for momenta in the @xmath24-@xmath23 plane , with additional relations possible for elastic scattering , as detailed also in section  [ discrete ] .",
    "the general angular condition appears compactly in terms of @xmath43-functions , the representations of the rotation operators .",
    "it can be rewritten in terms of masses and momentum transfer .",
    "we gave the translations for two cases .",
    "for electron - deuteron elastic scattering , the result is well known  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it does have an unchronicled ( we believe ) consequence .",
    "that is that the mass scale associated with the asymptotic power - law falloff of non - leading amplitudes must generally be of order of the nucleon or deuteron mass .",
    "it had been hoped that the light - front was a favored frame where the non - leading amplitudes would have small numerical coefficients : asymtotically of order @xmath211 , to an appropriate power , times the leading amplitude .",
    "as the angular condition contradicts this , it also takes away the motivation that underlay the suggestion of the universal behavior for spin-1 form factors .",
    "additionally , we gave the angular condition explicitly for the @xmath168-@xmath1 electromagnetic transition .",
    "we believe this result is also new .",
    "the angular conditon here fixes precisely the leading power of one subleading amplitude .",
    "the power law scaling of the helicity amplitudes can be analyzed , with a definite power of @xmath154 given in terms of the number of constituents in the wave function and in terms of the helicities of the incoming and outgoing states , and this can be done in either the light - front frame or in the breit frame .",
    "a preference for one or the other is sometimes given .",
    "our final `` application '' was to obtain the breit frame scaling from the light - front scaling using the transformation between them given earlier in section  [ relatons ] , and to find that the result is the same as one obtains doing the analysis directly in the breit frame .",
