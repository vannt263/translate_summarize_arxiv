    "entanglement of quantum states is the most non - classical feature of quantum systems .",
    "it shows up when the system consists of two ( or more ) subsystems and the total state can not be written as a product state .",
    "this notion can be generalized to mixed states , and mixed state is non - separable or entangled if a corresponding density matrix can not be expressed as convex combination of tensor products of density matrices of subsystems @xcite .",
    "pure entangled states as superpositions of multiparticle states , are fragile with respect to noise resulting from interaction with environment .",
    "so to control the effects of noise , it is important to understand details of the process of _ disentanglement _ i.e. to analyse how entanglement can be destroyed by this interaction .    in the paper , we describe the model of two two - level atoms interacting with thermal bath at formally infinite temperature .",
    "when atoms are separated by large distance , we can assume that the atoms are located inside two independent baths .",
    "in such a case time evolution of two - atomic system is given , in the markovian approximation , by the ergodic dynamical semi - group i.e. a trace preserving semi - group of completely positive operators which have the maximally mixed state @xmath0 invariant .",
    "density matrix corresponding to the state of the system satisfies the master equation which right hand side is given by the lindblad generator of the semi - group . since two atoms",
    "are largely separated , the dipol - dipol interaction and the photon exchanges between atoms are negligible , so in our model the generator is parametrized only by the dissipation rate @xmath1 .    from the general properties of this kind of evolution it follows that the entanglement as a function of time always decreases to zero , and that dynamics needs only a finite time to disentangle any initially entangled state .",
    "thus for all times @xmath2 greater then some _ time of disentanglement _",
    "@xmath3 , the states @xmath4 are separable .",
    "this finite - time effect should be compared with asymptotic noise - induced decoherence effects ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we calculate time evolution of some class of initial density matrices and obtain analytic expression for its entanglement .",
    "we also find formulas for @xmath5 in the cases of pure initial states and some mixed initial states . in that examples ,",
    "the time of disentanglement is the increasing function of the initial entanglement .",
    "another interesting aspect of dissipative evolution studied in the paper is connected with nonlocal properties of quantum states .",
    "nonlocality of quantum theory manifests by violation of bell inequalities , and in the case of two two - level atoms can be quantified by some parameter ranging from @xmath6 for local states to @xmath7 for states maximally violating some bell inequality .",
    "our dynamics enables also to consider evolution of this parameter .",
    "in particular , we show that the time after which all nonlocal properties of quantum state is lost is much shorter then the time of disentanglement .",
    "time evolution of a density matrix of two - level atom @xmath8 inside the bath with finite temperature @xmath9 can be described by the following master equation @xmath10+[{\\sigma_{+}}{\\rho},{\\sigma_{-}}]\\}+\\\\ & \\frac{{\\displaystyle}1}{{\\displaystyle}2}\\ , { \\gamma}_{\\downarrow}\\,\\ { [ { \\sigma_{-}},{\\rho}{\\sigma_{+}}]+[{\\sigma_{-}}{\\rho},{\\sigma_{+}}]\\ } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and we identify ground state @xmath12 and excited state @xmath13 of the atom with vectors @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 where @xmath18 @xmath19 is a spontaneous emission rate of the atom and @xmath20 is the frequency of the transition @xmath21 . since @xmath22",
    "when @xmath23 , for very high temperature ( @xmath24 ) we can assume that @xcite @xmath25 in this case ( ii.1 ) reduces to @xmath26 and @xmath27 generates the semi - group @xmath28 which is ergodic i.e. @xmath29 has a unique asymptotic state which is maximally mixed state @xmath30 in @xmath31 . so the relaxation process described by ( ii.3 ) which models the evolution of two - level atom inside the bath with very high ( infinite ) temperature , brings all initial states of the atom into the state with maximal entropy . in the other words ,",
    "the semi - group generated by ( ii.3 ) describes _ open quantum system _ ( two level atom ) interacting with _ noisy environment _ ( a bath with very high temperature ) .      in the case of two separated two - level atoms @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath32 located inside independent baths with formally infinite temperatures , the generator of the corresponding semi - group is given by the following generalization of ( ii.1 ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the state of the compound system @xmath35 , described by the hilbert space @xmath36 and the algebra of observables @xmath37 and @xmath38 the semi - group generated by @xmath39 is also ergodic with unique asymptotic state @xmath40 in @xmath41 . to simplify the discussion of the evolution of two - atomic system ,",
    "let us introduce the basis of so called collective states in the hilbert space @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath43 then this basis containing excited state , ground state and symmetric and antisymmetric combination of the product states , is defined as follows @xmath44 from the master equation ( ii.4 ) it follows that the matrix elements with respect to the basis @xmath45 of the state @xmath46 satisfy @xmath47 \\frac{d{\\rho}_{ss}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{ss}+{\\gamma}\\,({\\rho}_{ee}+{\\rho}_{gg})\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{gg}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{gg}+{\\gamma}\\,({\\rho}_{ss}+{\\rho}_{aa})\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{ee}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{ee}+{\\gamma}\\ , ( { \\rho}_{ss}+{\\rho}_{aa})\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{eg}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{eg}\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{as}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{as}\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{ae}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\,{\\rho}_{ae}-{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{gs}\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{ag}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{ag}-{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{ea}\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{se}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\,{\\rho}_{se}+{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{gs}\\\\[2 mm ] \\frac{d{\\rho}_{sg}}{dt}=&-2{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{sg}+{\\gamma}\\ , { \\rho}_{es } \\end{split}\\ ] ] notice that if the initial state belongs to the class of density matrices of the form @xmath48 then @xmath4 given by the solution of the equations ( ii.6 ) also belongs to that class . in this case one",
    "finds that @xmath49",
    "in the case when subsystems of the total system are described by two - dimensional hilbert spaces , the natural measure of the amount of entanglement a given quantum state contains i.e. the entanglement of formation @xcite @xmath50 where the minimum is taken over all possible decompositions @xmath51 and @xmath52\\ ] ] can be analytically computed as a function of another quantity @xmath53 called _ concurrence _ , which also can be taken as a measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 is defined as follows @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 the value of the number @xmath53 varies from @xmath6 for separable states , to @xmath7 for maximally entangled pure states .",
    "consider now the class ( ii.7 ) of density matrices .",
    "with respect to the canonical basis @xmath59 , the matrices ( ii.7 ) have also the same form i.e. @xmath60 one can check that for this class @xmath61 where @xmath62 or @xmath63 c_{2}=&\\sqrt{({\\rho}_{ss}-{\\rho}_{aa})^{2}-({\\rho}_{as}-{\\rho}_{sa})^{2}}-2\\ , \\sqrt{{\\rho}_{ee}{\\rho}_{gg } } \\end{split}\\ ] ] when we use the matrix elements with respect to the collective basis . in the special case",
    "when @xmath64 , @xmath65 can not be positive , so @xmath66 similarly , when @xmath67 , then @xmath68      suppose that the initial state of the two - atomic system belongs to the class ( ii.7 ) .",
    "since the evolution given by the master equation ( ii.4 ) leaves this class invariant , to compute entanglement at time @xmath2 we can use formulas ( iii.9 ) and ( ii.8 ) .",

    "we may call @xmath3 _ the time of disentanglement _ of a given initial state @xmath46 . for initial state ( iii.12 )",
    "@xmath76\\ ] ] as we show in the next section , the appearance of finite time of disentanglement for all initially entangled states , is the characteristic feature of the dynamics governed by the master equation ( ii.4 ) .",
    "the evolution of states given by the semi - group generated by @xmath39 has the following important properties : + * ( i ) * it is local i.e. if @xmath46 is separable , then @xmath4 is also separable for all @xmath77 , + * ( ii ) * every initial state @xmath46 evolves to a maximally mixed state @xmath78 .",
    "+ since maximally mixed state is separable and there is a neighbourhood of this state which contains only separable states , for an arbitrary state @xmath46 the set @xmath79 is always non - empty .",
    "moreover , if @xmath80 then @xmath81 and @xmath82 are disjoint and @xmath83 . notice that for every @xmath84 and every @xmath85 we have @xmath86 , so @xmath81 is bounded from below . now we can define _ the time of disentanglement _ @xmath3 of a state @xmath46 of two - atomic system as follows @xcite : @xmath87 since the set of separable states is compact , @xmath81 is closed and @xmath88 .",
    "therefore @xmath3 may be also defined as the smallest time for which @xmath4 is separable . from the above discussion",
    "it is clear that for every initial state of the system , there exist _ finite _ time of disentanglement ( which may be equal to @xmath6 for separable initial states ) .",
    "consider now some explicite examples .",
    "* pure initial states .",
    "+ since all pure entangled states @xmath89 with concurrence @xmath90 are locally equivalent to the state given by the vector ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath91 and our dynamics is local , it is enough to consider ( iv.4 ) as initial state .",
    "the corresponding density matrix @xmath92 0&0&0&0\\\\[1 mm ] 0&0&0&0\\\\[1 mm ] c&0&0&1-\\sqrt{1-c^{2 } } \\end{pmatrix}\\ ] ] evolves into      one can easily check that @xmath94\\ ] ] this finite time of disentanglement should be contrasted with infinite time needed for decoherence process ( see @xcite for discussion of different models ) . for pure initial states , we can introduce _ a decoherence rate _",
    "@xmath95 which tells us how fast given pure initial state becomes mixed during the evolution @xcite . if as a measure of mixedness we take the linear entropy @xmath96 then @xmath97 we see also that off - diagonal elements of @xmath98 vanish asymptotically with that rate . +",
    "another characteristic time of our evolution is connected with so called quantum non - locality i.e. the possibility of violating bell inequalities in quantum states @xcite .",
    "it is known that all pure entangled states violate bell inequalities @xcite , but this is not true for mixed states . in the case of two two - level systems , there is an effective criterion for violating bell inequalities in mixed states @xcite . for any density matrix @xmath46 ,",
    "take the real @xmath99 matrix @xmath100 define also real symmetric matrix @xmath101 with eigenvalues @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath46 violates some bell inequality if and only if @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 as a measure of nonlocality we may introduce a function @xmath105 initial state ( iv.5 ) violates bell inequality since @xmath106 on the other hand , @xmath107 decreases to @xmath6 , so there exists the time @xmath108 after which ( iv.14 ) is smaller then @xmath7 and nonlocality of initial state is lost .",
