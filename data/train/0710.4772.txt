    "development of coherent radiation sources for a wavelength below 0.1 nm ( which corresponds to the photon energy of tens kev or higher ) , i.e. in the gamma ray range , is a challenging goal of modern physics .",
    "such radiation will have many applications in basic science , technology and medicine .",
    "in particular , they will have a revolutionary impact in nuclear and solid state physics as well as in life sciences .",
    "the present state - of - the - art lasers are capable for emitting electromagnetic radiation from the infrared to ultraviolet range of spectrum .",
    "x - ray free - electron lasers are currently under construction @xcite . moving further ,",
    "i.e. into gamma ray band , is not possible without new approaches and technologies .",
    "one of the most promising approaches utilizes the spontaneous emission of gamma rays by ultrarelativistic charged particles undergoing channeling in periodically bent crystals .",
    "an undulator - type radiation is emitted in such a system in addition to the well - known channeling radiation due to the periodic motion of the particle that follows the shape of crystallographic planes or axes .",
    "the feasibility of gamma ray generation by ultrarelativistic positrons in planar channeling regime in crystals with periodically bent crystallographic planes was proven a decade ago @xcite ( see also the review @xcite and references therein ) . such a device is known as a crystalline undulator. recently , the feasibility of the crystalline undulator utilizing the planar channeling of electrons was demonstrated @xcite .",
    "the operation of the crystalline undulator is based on the phenomenon of charged particle channeling in crystals @xcite ( see also the latest review @xcite ) . channeling takes place if a charged particle enters a crystal nearly parallel to a crystallographic axis or plane .",
    "it can be confined by the electrostatic potential of crystal atoms so that it moves along the axis or plane .",
    "it is remarkable that the particle follows the shape of the axis or the plane if they are bent .",
    "therefore the particle trajectory inside the crystal can be controlled by choosing a suitable shape of the axes or planes @xcite .",
    "if crystallographic axes and planes are periodically bent , the trajectories of channeling particles are approximately sinusoidal .",
    "this results into emission of electromagnetic radiation predominantly in forward direction @xcite .",
    "the process of emission is very similar to that in the periodic magnetic field of an undulator @xcite .",
    "however , the electrostatic fields inside a crystal are so strong that they are able to steer the particles much more effectively than even the most advanced superconductive magnets . due to this fact",
    ", the period of crystal bending can be made two to four orders of magnitude smaller than the period of a conventional undulator.n@xmath0 layers onto the surface of a si crystal @xcite .",
    "one more possibility is growing of si@xmath1ge@xmath2 crystals@xcite with a periodically varying ge content @xmath3 @xcite . ]",
    "therefore the particle in a periodically bent crystal will emit electromagnetic radiation with much shorter wavelength , i.e. in the gamma ray frequency range .",
    "the emission of the gamma rays will become even more powerful if the positions of the charged particles in a crystalline undulator are correlated along the direction of their motion in such a way that the waves emitted by all particles have approximately the same phase .",
    "the resulting radiation is expected to be not only more powerful but also more coherent than the spontaneous radiation from uncorrelated particles .",
    "the physical picture of the coherent emission by correlated beam is similar to what happens in free electron lasers @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use for this process the term lasing effect in a crystalline undulator.    first , we consider a one - crystal scheme . the feasibility of obtaining a lasing effect in one crystalline undulator has been studied in @xcite within the quantum formalism . in the current work , this problem is revisited within the classical approach . indeed , the emission of comparatively low energy photons by a high energy particle ( i.e. , when @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 being , respectively , the photon and the particle energy ) can be treated classically .",
    "the classical approach @xcite has been widely used for the description of conventional free electron lasers ( see , for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerical estimation of the parameters of the positron - based crystalline undulator confirm the results of @xcite : extremely high densities of channeling positrons ( @xmath7 @xmath8 or higher ) would be needed to obtain a lasing effect in one periodically bent crystal .",
    "this suggest the necessity to search for alternative schemes which would be capable of reaching the lasing effect at considerably lower particle densities .",
    "reconsideration of the one - crystal scheme was necessary to develop the classical formalism applicable for the description of the lasing effect in crystalline undulator in presence of the dechanneling phenomenon ( i.e. the process of leaving the channeling regime due to scattering by crystal electrons and nuclei ) .",
    "this formalism is more convenient than the quantum one for the developing of alternative schemes .",
    "additionally , the one - crystal scheme , being the simplest one , provide a good reference point for the comparison with more sophisticated set - ups .",
    "we propose a two - crystal scheme in which the periodically bent crystals separated by a vacuum gap .",
    "the beam of charged particles passes both crystals successively .",
    "in the first crystal , a correlation is achieved between the momentum of the particle and its position along the beam direction .",
    "this correlation is transformed to a density modulation of the beam .",
    "the gamma radiation is generated mostly in the second crystal by the density - modulated beam .",
    "this scheme is similar to that of the optical klystron @xcite , but is expected to operate in the gamma ray range",
    ". therefore we call it a ` gamma klystron ' .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ one - crystal - amp ] , a one dimensional model of the one - crystal gamma ray amplifier",
    "is considered , the formalism is introduced , and numerical estimation are presented .",
    "the results of this section are used as a basis for the comparison in section [ two - crystal - amp ] , where the main subject of our work  the gamma klystron  is considered .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section [ conclussion ] .",
    "as it has been already mentioned above , the lasing effect in a crystalline undulator takes place if the positions of the channeling particles along the beam direction are correlated in such a way that the electromagnetic waves emitted by all particle have approximately the same phase .",
    "this is accomplished by a spatial modulation ( termed usually as bunching @xcite or microbunching @xcite ) of the particle density along the direction of the beam motion with the period equal to the wavelength of the emitted radiation .",
    "to obtain such a modulation , initial ( seed ) radiation from an external source is needed .",
    "this radiation may be generated by spontaneous emission of charged particles in a crystalline undulator or in the field of a infrared laser wave . in both cases",
    "the initial radiation has to be well collimated to ensure sufficient monochromaticity and coherence .    under certain conditions which are discussed below ,",
    "this radiation modulates the density of the particles channeling in a periodically bent crystal .",
    "then the bunched beam produces additional radiation of the same wavelength .",
    "in other words , the undulator amplifies the initial radiation .",
    "the amplifier is the only possible type of lasers in the hard x - ray and gamma ray range .",
    "the scheme of the gamma ray amplifier based on one crystalline undulator ( we call it ` one - crystal gamma ray amplifier ' ) is shown in figure [ amplifier ] .",
    "a charged particles beam and initial gamma radiation fall parallel to each other onto a periodically bent crystal of the length @xmath9 .",
    "the beam is aligned with the tangent of the bent crystallographic planes at the entrance .",
    "therefore , the particles are captured in the channeling mode and move along the planes following their shape . in this section",
    "we study the conditions under which the interaction between the radiation and the channeling particles leads to amplification of the radiation .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional model of the gamma ray amplifier .",
    "we assume the crystal and the beam to be infinitely wide in the @xmath3 and @xmath10 directions , which are perpendicular to the direction of the beam propagation ( the @xmath11 axis ) .",
    "the crystallographic planes are parallel to the @xmath3 axes and are bent in @xmath10-direction , so that particles channel in @xmath11-direction and oscillate along the @xmath10-axis ( see figure [ undulator ] ) .     and moves along the bent crystallographic planes following their nearly sinusoidal shape with the period @xmath12 and the amplitude @xmath13 and emitting electromagnetic waves .",
    "note that the scheme does not reflect the relative scale of @xmath14 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 adequately .",
    "in reality , these quantities satisfy the following double inequality @xmath15 . ]    in what follows the shape @xmath16 of the periodically bent midplane is assumed to have a harmonic form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the undulator period .",
    "the magnitude of the undulator period exceeds greatly the bending amplitude , i.e. @xmath20 ( or , equivalently , @xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "this inequality , which implies that the crystal deformation is an elastic one , follows from the important condition for a stable channeling in a periodically bent crystal .",
    "stable channeling occurs if the maximum centrifugal force @xmath22 in the channel is less than the maximum interplanar force @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 . for an ultra - relativistic particle , the centrifugal force depends on the particle energy as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the minimum curvature radius of the channel with the bending profile given by ( [ dynamics.1 ] ) .",
    "hence , the condition reads @xcite @xmath27 a thorough analysis carried out for a number of crystals @xcite allowed one to conclude that the crystalline undulator is feasible for the values of the bending parameter @xmath28 lying within the interval @xmath29 . for these @xmath28 values",
    "one obtains @xmath30 .    another important feature of a crystalline undulator concerns the relative magnitude of the bending amplitude @xmath13 and the interplanar spacing @xmath14 .",
    "it was demonstrated ( see @xcite ) that the operation of a crystalline undulator should be considered in the large - amplitude regime , which implies @xmath31 ( typically , @xmath32 ) .",
    "this condition , in particular , allows one to neglect the oscillations of the particle in the channel .",
    "thus , one can assume that under the action of the interplanar field , the particle follows the trajectory ( [ dynamics.1 ] ) .",
    "formally this means that the length @xmath33 , measured along the trajectory , can be used as a generalized coordinate which uniquely characterizes the position of the particle .",
    "the corresponding conjugate variable is the tangent projection of the particle momentum , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mass of the projectile and @xmath36 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath37 is due to the presence of the amplified radiation whose intensity is @xmath38 .",
    "the equation of motion reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the charge of the projectile , and @xmath41 is the unit tangent vector , @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 ) .",
    "the amplified radiation is sought in the form of a plane wave linearly polarized along the @xmath10 direction and characterized by the wavelength @xmath44 and the frequency @xmath45 ( here @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the speed of light ) .",
    "neglecting the attenuation of gamma rays and hard x rays ( see figure 6 in @xcite ) is by approximately an order of magnitude larger than the dechanneling length @xmath48 that determines the optimum length of the crystalline undulator .",
    "] of the radiation in the crystal , one describes the only non - zero component of the electric field of the amplified wave as follows @xmath49    substituting ( [ dynamics.5 ] ) into ( [ dynamics.4 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath50 one derives @xmath51 , \\label{dynamics.7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the following notations are used @xmath52    the energy exchange between the particle and the electromagnetic field is most effective when the phase @xmath53 stays nearly constant , otherwise the first sine term on the right - hand side of ( [ dynamics.7 ] ) oscillates , thus averaging out the energy exchange .",
    "the phase @xmath53 is constant provided the following resonant condition is fulfilled : @xmath54 using ( [ dynamics.9 ] ) and expressing the velocity @xmath55 in terms of the lorentz factor @xmath56 of the projectile , @xmath57 ( the limit @xmath58 is assumed ) , one notices that ( [ dynamics.10 ] ) reduces to the following relation between @xmath56 and the wave number @xmath59 : @xmath60 resolving this equation for @xmath61 one finds ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath63 of the fundamental harmonic coincides with @xmath64 which one finds from ( [ dynamics.12 ] ) .",
    "we will consider the emission stimulation in the first harmonic only . ]",
    "@xmath65 where @xmath66 is the undulator parameter .",
    "it follows from ( [ dynamics.12 ] ) that @xmath67 in the vicinity of the resonance ( [ dynamics.10 ] ) .",
    "therefore , putting @xmath68 in ( [ dynamics.7 ] ) , expanding then the right - hand side of the equation in the fourier series and , finally , omitting the oscillating terms one arrives at @xmath69 where @xmath70 with @xmath71 standing for the bessel functions .",
    "let us derive the equation which describes the evolution of the phase @xmath53 ( see ( [ dynamics.8 ] ) ) .",
    "differentiating ( [ dynamics.3 ] ) one gets @xmath72 . on the other hand , double differentiation of ( [ dynamics.8 ] )",
    "yields @xmath73 . combining these equations with ( [ dynamics.15 ] ) and noticing that @xmath74 one derives @xmath75 which has the form of the pendulum equation .",
    "the quantity @xmath76 , defined according to @xmath77 has the meaning of the oscillation frequency of the corresponding simple pendulum .",
    "the derivative @xmath78 can be related to the deviation of the particle energy @xmath79 from its resonance value @xmath80 : @xmath81    in what follows we consider the limit of _ small gain _ and _ small signal_. the limit of small gain means that the change in the amplitude @xmath82 is much smaller than its initial value at the entrance . in other words , the amplitude and , consequently , the frequency @xmath76 are approximately constant along the undulator .",
    "the small signal limit means that @xmath82 is small enough to ensure the inequality @xmath83 ( @xmath9 is the length of the undulator ) . in this case",
    "the pendulum equation ( [ dynamics.17a ] ) can be solved iteratively yielding @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 denote the quantities at the undulator entrance .",
    "the gain factor @xmath87 characterizes the relative increase in the energy of the amplified electromagnetic wave over the undulator length @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity is defined as follows @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the radiation energy density at the entrance point , and @xmath90 is the increase in the energy density ( with @xmath91 denoting the density at the exit from the undulator ) .",
    "it follows from the energy conservation law that the radiated energy equals to the decrease in the energy of the channeling particles due to the radiative losses .",
    "therefore , to calculate the gain factor one can analyze the radiative energy loss of the particles .",
    "the energy density of the beam particles , @xmath92 , at the distance @xmath93 can be written as @xmath94 here @xmath95 stands for the volume density of the channeling particles and @xmath96 denotes the average energy of a particle at the distance @xmath93 .",
    "the averaging procedure takes into account that the initial beam is not spatially modulated , i.e. that for different particles the instants of entry into the crystal are not correlated .",
    "in other terms , the particles are randomly distributed with respect to the phase @xmath97 at the entrance point ( see ( [ dynamics.8 ] ) ) . on the other hand , ( [ dynamics.7 ] )",
    "suggests that a particle s interaction with the radiation field depends on the value of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , to obtain @xmath96 one averages the energy @xmath98 with respect to @xmath85 : @xmath99 . in a crystalline undulator",
    "the particles move in a medium . due to collisions with the crystal constituents",
    "the channeling particle increases its transverse energy @xmath100 . at some point @xmath101",
    "exceeds the interplanar potential barrier and the particle leaves the channel .",
    "the average distance traveled by a particle in a crystal until it dechannels is called the dechanneling length @xmath102 . in a straight",
    "crystal @xmath102 depends on the crystal type , the crystallographic plane , the energy and the type of a projectile .",
    "in addition to these , @xmath102 acquires the dependence on the parameter @xmath28 @xcite in a bent crystal .",
    "the dechanneling effect results in a gradual decrease in the volume density of the channeled particles with the penetration distance .",
    "roughly , this decrease satisfies the exponential decay law @xcite : @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the beam density at the entrance of the crystal , and @xmath105 stands for the channel acceptance ( i.e. , the fraction of the incident particles which is captured into the channeling regime ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ gain.2 ] ) that the change @xmath106 of the beam energy density over the interval @xmath107 contains two terms .",
    "one of these , proportional to the derivative of @xmath95 , is due to the dechanneling process , whereas another one , proportional to @xmath108 , describes the radiative losses .",
    "it is exactly the latter term which is responsible for the change @xmath109 of the electromagnetic field energy .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath110 the derivative @xmath111 is calculated using ( [ dynamics.17a ] ) and ( [ dynamics.19 ] ) .",
    "then , integrating ( [ gain.4 ] ) , one obtains @xmath112 using ( [ dynamics.20 ] ) and introducing the expansion in powers of @xmath113 , one carries out the averaging over @xmath85 : @xmath114 substituting ( [ gain.5 ] ) with ( [ gain.6 ] ) into ( [ gain.1 ] ) one derives the following formula for the gain factor : @xmath115 here @xmath116 is the classical radius of the particle .",
    "the second argument of the gain factor in the left - hand side is introduced to indicate its dependence on the quantity @xmath86 .    in the limit of a short crystal , @xmath117",
    ", the dechanneling can be neglected .",

    "equation ( [ gain.8 ] ) presents a well - known formula for the gain factor of the conventional free electron laser obtained within the small signal and small gain approximation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in reality",
    ", the dechanneling can not be neglected .",
    "indeed , the dechanneling length of ultra - relativistic positrons ( these projectiles are the best candidates for the use in crystalline undulators , see discussion in @xcite ) measured in cm can be roughly estimated as @xmath121 with the energy in gev .",
    "hence , the dechanneling length for positrons with @xmath6 within the gev range does not exceed several millimeters .",
    "therefore , the limit of a long crystal , @xmath122 is of a great interest for an amplifier based on a crystalline undulator . , where @xmath123 is the attenuation length .",
    "in fact , @xmath123 for the photon energies in the range @xmath124 kev is on the level of several cm @xcite . ] assuming in ( [ gain.7 ] ) @xmath122 , one extends the upper limit of the integration to infinity and carries out the integral .",
    "the result reads @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "the factor @xmath127 attains its maximum of @xmath128 at @xmath129 .",

    "\\label{gain.9}\\ ] ] this formula coincides up to a numeric factor with the expressions obtained in @xcite within the quantum approach .",
    "the difference in the numeric factor is due to an additional approximation made in the cited papers .",
    "the gain factor ( [ gain.9 ] ) depends on a number of parameters .",
    "firstly , it depends on the bending period and amplitude .",
    "apart from the obvious dependence of the right - hand side on the period via @xmath133 , the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath13 enter via @xmath134 ( see ( [ dynamics.13 ] ) and ( [ dynamics.16 ] ) ) .",
    "additionally , they enter the acceptance @xmath105 and dechanneling length @xmath102 ( as discussed below ) .",
    "the latter are also dependent on the type of the crystal and the crystallographic plane as well as on the particle energy @xmath135 .    in this section",
    "we present the scheme which allows one to define the optimum values of these parameters , i.e. those which insure the largest possible gain for a given crystal and initial beam density @xmath104 .",
    "our analysis is restricted to a positron beam .    to facilitate the analysis it is convenient to express the quantities on the right - hand side of ( [ gain.9 ] ) in terms of the parameter @xmath28 and the undulator parameter @xmath136 introduced in ( [ dynamics.2 ] ) and ( [ dynamics.13 ] ) , respectively .",
    "we remind that @xmath28 stands for the ratio of the maximum centrifugal force acting on the particle in the periodically bent channel to the maximum gradient of the interplanar potential that keeps the particle in the channel .",
    "this definition implies that @xmath137 , otherwise all the particles will be thrown out of the channel by the centrifugal force .",
    "the lower limit , @xmath138 corresponds to a straight channel , @xmath139 ( or @xmath140 ) . in this limit",
    "there is no undulator motion and , consequently , there is no radiation amplification .",
    "thus , the largest gain corresponds to some optimum value of @xmath28 lying between @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath28-dependence of the dechanneling length of an ultra - relativistic positron can be modeled as follows @xcite : @xmath143 where @xmath144 stands for the dechanneling length in the straight channel , @xmath145 is the thomas - fermi radius of the crystal atom , and @xmath146 is the coulomb logarithm which characterizes the ionization losses of an ultra - relativistic particle in amorphous media @xcite ( @xmath147 denotes an average ionization potential of the atom ) .",
    "similarly , the acceptance @xmath105 of a bent channel can be related to the acceptance @xmath148 of the corresponding straight channel @xcite : @xmath149 with @xmath150 .    expressing the undulator wave number @xmath151 via @xmath28 and @xmath136 @xmath152 one re - writes ( [ gain.9 ] ) in the form @xmath153_{\\eta = k^2/(4 + 2k^2)}. \\label{optimization.4}\\ ] ]    the formulas ( [ optimization.1 ] ) and ( [ optimization.1a ] ) suggests that the ratio @xmath154 weakly ( logarithmically ) depends on the beam energy : an order of magnitude change in @xmath155 results in a less than 10% change of the ratio .",
    "therefore , we assume this ratio to be constant for a given crystal . then , the gain factor , in addition to the linear proportionality with respect to @xmath104 , is a function of two independent variables , @xmath28 and @xmath136 .",

    "the above expression is derived in the small - gain approximation , but not in the small - signal approximation , i.e. it is valid even when the argument of the bessel function is of the order of one . in the following ,",
    "however , we restrict our consideration to the weak signal regime to make a comparison with the one - crystal amplifier .",
    "in the small - signal case , the radiation gain does not depend on the amplitude of the initial wave and has the form @xmath199 ^ 2 h ( u_1 , u_2 , v)\\ ] ] with @xmath200 } { \\sqrt{1 + v^2 } } \\ , .\\ ] ]    the optimum value of @xmath174 can be chosen by maximizing the function @xmath201 .",
    "the maximum is reached at @xmath202 .    for fixed values of @xmath174 , @xmath176 and @xmath175 , the variables",
    "@xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 depend only on single variable , @xmath86 . the optimum value of @xmath86 is found by maximizing the function @xmath206 . taking into account",
    "that @xmath207 due to ( [ l2ggl1l3 ] ) one finds that the maximum is reached at @xmath208 and is approximately equal to @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the maximum radiation gain which can be reached in the gamma klystron is @xmath209 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{gklystron}\\ ] ] here @xmath210 is the base of the natural logarithm . in ( [ gklystron ] ) and ( [ ratio ] ) should not be confused with the particle charge @xmath40 . ]    comparing this formula with ( [ gain.9 ] ) one sees that , for the same parameters of the crystals and the beam , the radiation gain in the gamma klystron exceeds the gain achievable in the one - crystal amplifier by the following factor @xmath211 this means that a significant gain can be obtained in the gamma klystron at much lower beam densities than in the one - crystal amplifier , provided that @xmath176 is essentially larger than @xmath212 .",
    "so far we considered a hard x ray or gamma ray amplifier in the small gain regime .",
    "estimations in section [ optimization ] were made for the case @xmath213 , i.e. when the amplifier doubles the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation .",
    "of cause , such a small gain is insufficient .",
    "a usefull device should be able to amplify the signal by several orders of magnitude .",
    "there are two methods of increasing the gain .",
    "the first one is straightforward .",
    "it is merely increasing the density of the positron beam .",
    "this will switch the amplifier into the large gain regime .",
    "the potential of this method is , however , limited .",
    "for one crystal amplifier , one needs very high positron densities , @xmath214 @xmath8 , to reach even @xmath213 . using",
    "the klystron scheme will decrease the minimum necessary density by severals orders of magnitude .",
    "nonetheless , this quantity will likely remain at the edge of the capabilities of the accelerator technique and the sustainability of the crystalline materials . therefore ,",
    "increasing the positron density much beyond the minimum necessary level will be difficult .",
    ", the radiation intensity will be amplified by the factor of @xmath215 , where @xmath216 is the number of the cascades .",
    "`` bd '' stands for the positron beam dump . ]",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by using the second method of increasing the gain : combining several klystrons into a multicascade amplifier .",
    "this scheme is shown in figure [ multicascade_fig ] . scattering the beam particles in the crystal decreases the beam intensity and increases its emittance .",
    "thereofore , each cascade should be fed by a fresh positron bunch from the accelerator .",
    "the radiation passes each cascade successively and is being gradually amplified .",
    "the distance between the bunches has to be chosen in such a way that each bunch enters the crystal at the same time as the wavepackage of the radiation reaches the corresponding cascade .",
    "the resulting amplification factor will be @xmath215 , where @xmath131 is the gain of each cascade and @xmath216 is the number of cascades .",
    "we analyzed two different schemes of the gamma ray amplifier .",
    "both schemes are based on crystalline undulators - single crystals with periodically bent crystallographic planes exposed to a high energy charged particle beam . due to the channeling phenomenon ,",
    "ultra - relativistic charged particles move along nearly sinusoidal trajectories inside the crystal .",
    "initial gamma radiation traveling through the crystal parallel to the beam is amplified due to interaction with the channeling particles .",
    "we have shown , that the simplest one - crystal scheme would require extremely high ( more than @xmath217 particles per cubic centimeter ) positron beam densities to obtain significant amplification . which makes practical realization of this scheme extremely challenging .",
    "on the other hand , the two - crystal klystron scheme seems to be more promising . a significant gain",
    "could be obtained at much lower densities , provided that the distance @xmath176 between two crystals in the klystron exceeds greatly the dechanneling length @xmath212 . the question how large the distance @xmath176 can be in a realistic device",
    "can not be answered within the present approach .",
    "the simple one - dimensional model considered in the present paper does not put any restrictions on the distance @xmath176 . in reality , the restrictions on @xmath176 come from the energy spread ( longitudinal temperature ) of the beam .",
    "this is , however a technical restriction that depends on the quality of the beam determined by the parameters of the accelerator .",
    "physical restrictions are more important .",
    "they appear , for instance , due to the longitudinal velocity spread induced by the channeling oscillations and incoherent scattering in the first crystal or the beam divergence in the vacuum gap due to the volume charge .",
    "hence further analysis is needed to give the final answer about the feasibility of practical realization of the gamma klystron .",
