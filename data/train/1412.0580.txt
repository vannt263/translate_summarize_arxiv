    "the role of the microcirculation is increasingly being recognized in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases ; eg . hypertension  @xcite and diabetes  @xcite . in particular , assessing retinal blood flow can be potentially useful for understanding diabetic retinopathies  @xcite , and study the relationships between vascularization and glaucoma  @xcite .",
    "moreover , extensive use of optical methods is made for monitoring skin microvascular endothelial ( dys)function  @xcite .",
    "prevalent optical techniques to monitor microvascular blood flow in clinical studies are laser doppler probes and spatial speckle contrast imaging .",
    "the former is characterized by its high temporal resolution and the latter enables wide - field imaging of superficial microvascular networks .",
    "superficial blood flow monitoring require sensitivity in low light , high temporal resolution , high spatial resolution , and the ability to perform quantitative flow measurements .",

    "the observation and interpretation of doppler broadening of a scattered laser light beam by a fluid in motion in vitro  @xcite and in vivo  @xcite has led to the physical modeling of laser doppler velocimetry  @xcite .",
    "mapping retinal hemodynamics _ in vivo _ has many biomedical applications such as diagnosis of retinal microvasculature disorders  @xcite .",
    "optical instrumentation is well adapted to non - invasive retinal blood flow imaging , because the eye fundus vascular tree is visible through the cornea and is thus potentially accessible for light imaging .",
    "the doppler shift of a monochromatic optical radiation scattered by a moving target is the scalar product of the optical momentum transfer with the target velocity .",
    "doppler shifts are cumulative . in the case of multiple scattering , algebraic doppler shifts add - up throughout each optical path , and the broadening of the backscattered radiation still carries a highly valuable information , for velocity assessment  @xcite . under coherent illumination",
    ", the local motion of scatterers can be probed either by the analysis of local spatial contrast , the local temporal fluctuations , or the local rf doppler spectrum of the speckle pattern  @xcite . single point laser doppler detection schemes in heterodyne  @xcite or self - mixing  @xcite configurations",
    "are prevalent in practical detection of blood flow from wideband temporal optical fluctuations analysis , for superficial blood flow sensing .",

    "these techniques have been adopted over the past decades for imaging of blood flow dynamics in real - time .",
    "their rapid adoption for physiological studies is due to to the ability to quantify blood flow changes with good spatial and temporal resolution .",
    "local motion imaging by the analysis of spatial contrast of laser speckle is a simple and robust method to achieve full - field imaging  @xcite .",
    "it is a widely used imaging technique to image blood flow in vivo , primarily due to advantages like ease of instrumentation , reproducibility  @xcite , and low cost  @xcite .",

    "motion of scattering particles , like the red blood cells , causes spatial and temporal blurring of the speckle pattern . in speckle contrast imaging ,",
    "the interference pattern is recorded with a camera , and the blurring of the pattern is quantified to obtain a measure of relative change in flow . spatial contrast analysis techniques improved to assessment of quantitative relative changes in local blood perfusion with exposure - control of the recorded frames  @xcite and consideration of the non - fluctuating light component in contrast analysis models  @xcite .",
    "speckle contrast analysis schemes were used to generate images of blood flow in the rat retina in traditional configuration  @xcite , and via an endoscope  @xcite .",

    "recently , the technique was used with success to monitor cerebral blood flow during neurosurgery in the human brain  @xcite .",
    "full - field laser doppler imaging techniques from time - domain optical intensity fluctuations measurements on sensor arrays can enable monitoring of blood perfusion changes  @xcite .",
    "in these approaches , laser doppler signal processing is performed off - chip , which means that large digital data transfers have to be handled from the sensor array to the processing unit of a computer .",
    "recently , image - plane laser doppler recordings with a high throughput complementary metal  oxide  semiconductor ( cmos ) camera in conjunction with short - time discrete fourier transform calculations by a field programmable gate array ( fpga ) reportedly enabled continuous monitoring of blood perfusion in the mm / s range .",
    "full - field flow maps of 480 @xmath0 480 pixels were rendered at a rate of 14 hz , obtained from image recordings at a frame rate of 14.9 khz  @xcite .",
    "however , cameras capable of frame rates of up to several kilohertz and data transfer rates still larger than the commercially available ones are a requirement in this approach . locally processing",
    "the laser doppler signal within the sensor array can prevent large data throughputs off - chip , which is presently a technological bottleneck .",
    "to circumvent data transfer issues , fully - integrated cmos sensor arrays with doppler signal processing were developed  @xcite , which have the advantage of enabling not only digital but also analog signal processing , which permits capacitive coupling to cancel dc contributions and low - pass filtering of the analog signal to process .",
    "such sensors were demonstrated to achieve 64 @xmath0 64 pixel blood flow images at 1 frame per second  @xcite , with a sampling bandwidth of 40 khz . on - chip laser doppler signal processing",

    "for instance , blood flow contrasts were imaged by holography in the cerebral cortex  @xcite and in the eye fundus  @xcite of rodents with a standard camera .",
    "time - averaged holography with a frequency - shifted reference beam was shown to enable narrow band detection and imaging of local doppler broadenings  @xcite .",
    "blood flow contrasts were also successfully rendered with wideband detection of optical fluctuations in holographic configuration  @xcite .",
    "laser doppler holography enables narrowband optical heterodyne detection with the benefit of canceling laser amplitude noise , which can be efficiently filtered spatially in off - axis recording configuration  @xcite at the price of a reduction of the available spatial bandwidth .",
    "hence holographic schemes have a major advantage in comparison with direct image recording schemes , especially for narrowband doppler detection with video - rate cameras .",
    "we report on quantitative fluid flow assessment in vitro and in vivo from holographic interferometry , which enables wide - field imaging of a doppler - shifted radiation with an array detector .",

    "multiply - scattered light yields doppler spectra from which the directional information is lost because of wave vector randomization during scattering . nevertheless , it has the advantage of providing spatially - resolved wide - field hemodynamic contrast .",
    "our strategy is to use an inverse - problem approach to derive velocity maps of blood flow from optically - acquired doppler maps ; we make use of elementary results from the diffusing - wave spectroscopy formalism  @xcite in backscattering configuration in order to retrieve local root mean square velocities  @xcite .",
