    "quantum coherence driven by the goal of quantum computation is a central theme of present - day research in mesoscopic condensed - matter physics . in particular in the field of superconducting qubits",
    "@xcite , spectacular successes have been achieved , such as rabi oscillations , charge and flux echo , and a controlled - not gate @xcite . in order to achieve this , the decoherence due to the ubiquitous environmental degrees of freedom in solid - state systems had to be overcome .",
    "in fact , careful modelling of the environment allows to make predictions of the relaxation and dephasing times , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , which are extracted either from spectroscopic line widths or from fitting exponential envelopes to rabi- or ramsey oscillation data @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions of @xmath2 are in reasonable agreement with experiments .",
    "@xmath1 is mostly attributed to @xmath3-noise@xcite for which self - consistent theories can be formulated @xcite even though the detailed origins of that noise are not quantitatively predictable yet . technically , the notion of exponential decay of coherences on scales @xmath0 is based on a markov approximation of some , potentially implicit , type .    on the other hand ,",
    "a variety @xcite of controlled experiments show an additional _ loss of visibility _ : next to the exponential decay given by @xmath0 , the amplitude of coherent oscillations is reduced even further , i.e. , it does not extrapolate back to the full expected amplitude at @xmath4 . this behavior is not explained by a simple @xmath0-picture .",
    "this reduced visibility is an obstacle for the demonstration of macroscopic quantum effects in these devices , e.g. , of the violation of bell s inequality in a coupled qubit system @xcite , and for quantum computing applications .",
    "it has so far mostly been attributed to technological shortcomings of the detector .",
    "this paper introduces a different , additional mechanism for a reduced visibility based on non - markovian effects in the spin boson model .",
    "this generic effect is induced i ) by higher order processes involving virtual intermediate states , which rapidly entangle system and environment and ii ) potential initial entanglement between system and environment .",
    "we show , that the reduction originates from the off - resonant high - frequency parts of the environmental spectrum which do not contribute to @xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrate that reduced visibility is compatible with large @xmath1-values in superohmic and gapped environments and has to be considered as an independent quantifier of decoherence .",
    "we identify such environments in recent experiments and estimate the loss of visibility they induce .",
    "as a generic model , we consider the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where the @xmath6 are pauli matrices and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are boson annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the bath is characterized by the spectral density @xmath9 which is related to the equilibrium spectral noise power @xmath10 .",
    "this model is realized in superconducting qubits , where the bath is the electromagnetic environment @xcite or by phonons @xcite , which also play an important role in quantum dots @xcite . here and henceforth , we chose @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the spin - boson model is in general not exactly solvable .",
    "it has been treated with a number of approaches @xcite . for quantum computing ,",
    "the @xmath13 are small at @xmath14 by design and the system - bath coupling is usually treated perturbatively .",
    "if the system - bath interaction also defines the longest time in the problem , a markov approximation is justified ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this procedure leads to variants of the well - known bloch - redfield master equation which predicts strictly exponential decay of the spin projections contained in the system+bath density matrix @xmath15 , @xmath16 $ ] with time scales @xmath0 .",
    "thus , conceivably , such an approach can not describe the loss of visibility .",
    "moreover , many designed environments use the option to allow for larger @xmath13 at high frequencies@xcite , @xmath17 .    in order to go beyond bloch - redfield ,",
    "we use two approaches : for @xmath18 , the spin - boson model reduces to the exactly solvable _ independent boson model _ @xcite . for @xmath19 we will use perturbation theory in the qubit hamiltonian to obtain approximate insights .",
    "we will recover similar physics in both cases .",
    "we now proceed to the exact solution for a very general initial state in the independent boson limit .",
    "we can perform a schmid decomposition of the initial density matrix in the qubit @xmath20 bath hilbert space as @xmath21 as the bath is composed of noninteracting oscillators , the submatrices @xmath22 remain factorized within the bath modes @xmath23 .",
    "note that the submatrices do not have to be valid density matrices , only the complete @xmath15 has to be .",
    "all matrices with bounded trace can be parameterized with the characteristic function @xmath24 of the wigner function @xmath25 $ ] with @xmath26 the displacement operator for mode @xmath23 .",
    "preparing such an initial state requires to use controls with @xmath27 at @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that for @xmath18 the hamiltonians at different times @xmath29 commute allows us to exactly compute the propagator in interaction representation .",
    "the result can be written as a product of @xmath30-operators , @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "the application of these to the density matrix is straightforward , the essentially induce a coordinate transformation on the @xmath33 : the matrix of characteristic functions will be @xmath34 where the phase factor comes from multiplying the displacement operators and reads @xmath35 $ ]",
    ". we can conclude that @xmath36 with @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "this simple property that time evolution is a mere change of coordinate frame is the main rationale for resorting to @xmath24 as a phase - space parameterization of the density matrix .",
    "the other rationale is that @xmath24 makes it in particular easy to compute expectation values of qubit operators @xmath39 using the corrolary @xmath40 = { \\rm tr}\\left[\\rho_{ij}\\prod_{k}d^{(k)}_{ij}(0)\\right]=\\prod_k\\chi^{(k)}_{ij}(0,0,t)$ ] as @xmath41 = \\sum_{i , j\\in\\lbrace0,1\\rbrace}\\langle i|q|j\\rangle \\prod_k\\chi^{(k)}_{ij}(-\\delta\\alpha(t),-\\delta\\alpha^\\ast(t),0)\\ ] ] without any further integration .    from knowing the full density matrix at any time @xmath29 we can calculate any property of the system we like , including correlation functions .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is , however , to discuss the quantum system alone in order to establish the connection to master equation approaches .",
    "being at the pure dephasing point we can see that there is no dynamics on the diagonal elements : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    on the off - diagonal , things get more involved .",
    "we focus on studying the coherence given in terms of the charateristic wigner function as @xmath44    we can work out explicitly @xmath45 and it is easy to show that the phase factor drops out .",
    "we now apply this technique to a physical realistic realization by assuming a specific @xmath46 .",
    "the main restriction on this function is that @xmath15 has to be a valid density matrix , i.e. hermitian , normalized , and positive .",
    "we are restricting ourselves to symmetrically entangling a qubit that is initially in an eigenstate of @xmath47 with classical states of the bath oscillators , i.e. by choosing for the complete initial density matrix @xmath48 with @xmath49 is the thermal density matrix for the bath and @xmath50 displaces each bath mode in opposite directions in phase space conditionioned on the two states of the qubit , i.e. it performs a controlled unitary displacement by some mode - specific amound @xmath51 of the bath oscillators . reusing the multiplication property of displacement operators",
    "this means that @xmath52 with the phase space function of a thermal state being @xmath53 in this limit , we thus obtain @xmath54 taking the continuum limit and substituting @xmath55 with real dimensionless coefficients @xmath56 and @xmath57 . taking the continuum limit we find @xmath58 with @xmath59.\\nonumber \\label{eq : gensx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] different choices of @xmath60 and @xmath61 can lead to rich dynamics .",
    "we single out prominent quantities : the initial amplitude @xmath62 $ ] , the time constant @xmath1 of exponential decay in the long - time limit , @xmath63 and the visibility , the amplitude found when extrapolating the long - time behavior back to @xmath64 @xmath65=\\lim_{t\\rightarrow\\infty } e^{\\frac{t}{t_2}-k(t)}=e^{-{\\cal p}\\int \\frac{d\\omega}{\\omega^2}s(\\omega)((1+u(\\omega))^2+v^2(\\omega))}. \\label{eq : visibility}\\ ] ] we analyze this result in important limiting cases .",
    "factorizing initial conditions imply for the density matrix @xmath66 , i.e.  in our notation @xmath67 .",
    "this case corresponds to environments which are part of a detector or any piece of electromagnetic environment that is switched on _ during _ the experiment , e.g. the dc - squid detecting a flux qubit @xcite .",
    "it also applies to the case of excitons @xcite as the two - state system that are created by ultrafast laser control in the beginning of the experiment . from the above result",
    ", we can see that this is the only case in which the initial amplitude is unity , @xmath68 , i.e. when the actual oscillations starts at full amplitude . in this case",
    ", @xmath69 can be written as @xcite @xmath70 the long - term expansion of this result can be written as @xmath71+o(1/t)$ ] with @xmath72 .",
    "note , that the rate @xmath73is identical to the bloch - redfield result , but additionally the constant term @xmath74=\\exp\\left[-{\\cal p}\\int_{0}^\\infty \\frac{s(\\omega)}{\\omega^2}\\right]$ ] describes an overall loss of amplitude .",
    "here @xmath75 denotes the cauchy mean value .",
    "the dynamics resulting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : joft ] ) can be interpreted in terms of environmental quantum noise .",
    "this is accomplished by looking at the second equality of eq.([eq : joft ] ) which multiplies @xmath76 with a spectral weight of width @xmath77 . when the system has been coupled to the environment for a time @xmath78 , it samples its spectrum over a bandwidth of @xmath79 due to frequency - time uncertainty .",
    "this bandwidth goes to zero only in the long - time limit .",
    "quantum - mechanically , the long - time limit only captures direct energy - conserving processes between system and environment , whereas at shorter times also higher - order processes involving energetically forbidden intermediate states play a role .",
    "the leading process beyond @xmath1 is the excitation of an environmental mode followed by the relaxation of another , excited state in the environment with infinitesimally different energy .",
    "these modes have to be distinct in order to leave a trace in the environment which is a necessary condition to entangle system and environment and hence cause true dephasing .",
    "thus , it is crucial that the environment is in an excited state in the beginning of this cycle . in our case",
    ", this is guaranteed by the factorized initial conditions : the ground state of the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite is an appropriate dressed state of the spin . when the interaction is switched on , energy is redistributed : forming this dressed state formes lowers the extra energy compared to the initial state.the extra energy is accomodated in bath excitations necessary for true dephasing as just explained .",
    "we will now study the consequences of these results for a number of important spectra , starting with the ones where @xmath80 , i.e.  a constant amplitude at long times .",
    "these structured environments are an important test - bed for our approach because all the decoherence is from non - markovian effects .     and its envelope in the gapped ohmic model using @xmath81 @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "the exact result is compared to the envelope which would be obtained within bloch - redfield theory for the same model . ]",
    "the gapped ohmic model approximately describes the effect of the quasiparticle transport channel shunting a josephson junction @xcite .",
    "its spectral density reads @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the heaviside unit step function . in the limit of @xmath87 , we find @xmath74=\\left(\\frac{e_g}{\\omega_c}\\right)^{\\alpha_1 } e^{-\\alpha_1\\gamma}$ ] where @xmath88 it the euler - mascheroni constant .",
    "the amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_ohmic_slip ] drops to this level during a time @xmath89 , indicating the time permitted by the energy - time uncertainty relation over which virtual excitations above the gap edge may be maintained .",
    "the same physics holds for soft gaps such as in the standard superohmic case , @xmath90 .",
    "this model describes phonon baths as well as electromagnetic environments blocked off at low frequency by a serial capacitance @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath69 can be given in closed form @xcite .",
    "for @xmath91 we find a visibility of @xmath74=\\exp\\left[2\\alpha_q\\gamma(q-1)\\right]$ ] for @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath93 , the amplitude decays non - exponentially , also at long times , given by @xmath94 and for @xmath95 we find @xmath96 .",
    "these sub - exponential decay features can not be characterized by a time scale @xmath1 and may resemble reduced visibility if the observation does not span enough time .",
    "loss of visibility is _ not _ restricted to gapped models .",
    "it is usually joined by genuine exponential @xmath1 decoherence .",
    "this is illustrated in the ohmic spin - boson model @xmath97 , which describes the quantum version of classical friction and e.g.decribes standard resistive environments as well as gapless electron - hole excitations . at finite @xmath98",
    ", we identify a finite @xmath99 .",
    "the full shape of the envelope in the long - time limit , @xmath100 , is however @xmath101 , i.e.  there is a visibility prefactor @xmath102=(t/\\omega_c)^{\\alpha}$ ] . at @xmath84 ,",
    "the long - time limit is never reached as there is no low - energy scale in the problem , and we find power law decay , @xmath103 .",
    "thus , at @xmath104 , the very small @xmath102 $ ] reflects the fact that for most of the time the power - law decay dominates and the long - time expansion involving @xmath1 becomes valid at extremely long times only . the finite temperature behavior is illustrated in fig .",

    "factorized initial conditions are standard assumptions in the theory of open quantum systems , however , they are not always realistic .",
    "it is already seen in our above result eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensx ] ) , that our prediction of an initial drop qualitatively holds for essentially any nonequilbrium initial condition . as a complementary case , we chose the @xmath106 such that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensx ] ) @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "physically , this state corresponds to a qubit dressed by environmental oscillators at all frequencies .",
    "it is the variational ( in @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) ground state as long as @xmath111 .",
    "it is thus a two - state analog to the initial condition discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite.inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gensx ] ) shows that these initial conditions are special in two ways : i ) the envelope @xmath112 is constant in time , @xmath113 and ii ) visibility @xmath114 $ ] has the maximum possible value .",
    "it is related to the visibility of the factorized system by @xmath114=\\sqrt{v[0,0]}$ ] .",
    "these observations can be physically motivated from the minimization of the total energy , which implies that no further rearrangement of the bath is necessary for forming the proper dressed states and the dressing is optimum by accomodating the smallest possible total energy .",
    "consequently , any other initial condition is not optimal and contains irreversible parts of the interaction with the environment , i.e. , genuine @xmath1 decoherence ( i.e. finite @xmath1 ) , which we have already identified above as redistribution of surplus energy .",
    "we appreciate from these results , that the initial conditions play a decisive role .",
    "in fact , the visibility prefactor is a long - time consequence of short - time physics governed by the initial conditions .",
    "the choice of initial condition depends on the type of physical environment and experimental procedure : a detector is typically switched on during the experiment and is well described by factorizing initial conditions .",
    "if the switch is non - adiabatic and it happens on a time - scale @xmath115 , this can be taken into account by chosing @xmath116 for @xmath117 and @xmath118 for @xmath119 as an initial state in the expression for the visibility .",
    "the baths in the material and/or the control environment are permanently coupled to the qubit . in a typical experiment , where on top of the pure dephasing hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : general_hamiltonian ] ) a large @xmath120 term is applied at times @xmath28 , the entangled initial condition gives a realistic approximation for the initial state , predicting a reduced visibility at all times .",
    "realistic experiments , involving a non - trivial preparation sequence encoded in @xmath121 at @xmath28 may be described by variants of these initial conditions . however , the fact that the variational ground state shows the highest possible visibility outlines the strength of our result : in many experiments , the detector signal representing @xmath122 is not known _ a priori _ and is obtained by ground state measurements .",
    "following our results , the visibility obtained in a dynamical experiment is always smaller , @xmath123\\le v[-1,0]$ ] .",
    "thus , our theory does even apply to these data , the loss of visibility is not an artefact of the initial condition , it rather is a generic consequence of the fact that quantum computing takes place far from thermal equilibrium .",
    "in fact , the short time slip accomodates the extra energy of the system relative to the dressed ground state .",
    "moreover , experiments with good short - time resolution such as the phase qubit setup show an explicit sign of an initial drop of the oscillation amplitude @xcite .",
    "so far , we have primarily discussed the exactly solvable pure dephasing point of hamiltonian eq.([eq : general_hamiltonian ] ) , mainly for being able to easily circumvent the born and markov approximations .",
    "our qualitative results do however not depend on that assumption .",
    "although a more general solution may require more elaborate methods such as path integral expansions @xcite , flow equations @xcite or real - time rg @xcite , we can verify this conclusion by elementary means for the gapped environment , when @xmath124 .",
    "as shown before , this environment does not lead to markovian decoherence and thus all decoherence effects are necessarily purely nonmarkovian . in this case , it is legitimate to proceed by perturbation theory in @xmath125 .",
    "the eigenstates of the unperturbed , @xmath126 , hamiltonian are two - fold degenerate and can be written as @xmath127 with eigenenergies @xmath128 .",
    "the perturbation hamiltonian lifts the degeneracy and splits the doubletts into sublevels @xmath129 here , the angle depends on the @xmath130 and is given by @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "this can be viewed as a down - scaling of the effective tunnel splitting connected to that specific energies .",
    "the shifted energies are @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "we now use these approximate eigenstates for the gedanken experiment analogous to the pure dephasing case : we prepare the system in the equal superposition @xmath135 factorized to the bath and compute the probability of returning onto the initial state , @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137 is obtained by expanding the @xmath138 in the basis of the approximate eigenstates , @xmath139 .",
    "the expansion coefficients read @xmath140 where @xmath141 .",
    "this expression nicely illustrates our previous point that the initial state is broken up into entangled states that contain significant bath excitations .",
    "we now propagate these in time .",
    "we find without further approximations @xmath142\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recover the factorizd pure dephasing result in the case of @xmath18 .",
    "for the other extreme , @xmath143 , we recognize that the last term is dropping out but the sum can not be performed analytically .",
    "we observe because the @xmath144 dependence of the argument of the cosine provided additional decoherence .",
    "for general @xmath145 , the second , phase shifted term that originates from misalignment of the pure and effective magnetic field @xmath146 on the bloch sphere provides yet another dephasing channel .",
    "a full numerical analysis of these cases goes far beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "qualitatively , we see that the dephasing familiar from the pure dephasing case combines with further dephasing channels , rendering our previous discussion to remain valid beyond the pure dephasing point .",
    "note that @xmath147 at @xmath148 leads to the same expression that appears in the adiabatic renormalization treatment at @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "clearly , the results of this section recover the features of the above discussion and shows , that the assumption of pure dephasing is not crucial for the physics of the loss of visibility .",
    "any more quantitative statement should build on more quantitative numerical methods .",
    "a wealth of these methods has been developped in the last years , including work on the numerical renormalization group @xcite , analytical rg @xcite , and non - markovian master equations @xcite .",
    "we have seen that for experiments with long @xmath1 , a pronounced loss of visibility is governed by gapped baths , unlike the temporal decay , which is dominated by @xmath3-noise .",
    "such baths can be identified in experiments .",
