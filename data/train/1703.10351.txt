    "during the last decade , many new states with hidden charm - quark pair were discovered  @xcite . the number of observed states in experiments is more than that of the predicted charmonium states in potential models for the mass above the @xmath8 threshold  @xcite and there",
    "are also charged states which are obviously not charmonium states .",
    "these states , such as the @xmath9  @xcite , the @xmath10  @xcite , and the @xmath11  @xcite , are referred to as charmoniumlike states or @xmath12 particles  @xcite .    among these new charmoniumlike states , there are many vector states with quantum numbers @xmath13 that are usually called @xmath14 states , like the @xmath10  @xcite , the @xmath15  @xcite , and the @xmath16  @xcite . the @xmath14-states show strong coupling to hidden - charm final states in contrast to the vector charmonium states in the same energy region ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) which couples dominantly to open - charm meson pairs .",
    "these @xmath14 states are good candidates for new types of exotic particles and stimulated many theoretical interpretations , including tetraquarks , molecules , hybrids , or hadrocharmonia  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath14 states were observed in @xmath20 factories with limited statistics since they are produced from initial state radiation processes with data collected at around 10.6  gev in the bottomonium energy region  @xcite .",
    "the high precision cross section measurements and the study of these states in different final states in direct @xmath21 annihilation in the charmonium energy region from the besiii experiment supply new insight into their properties .    in 2013 , besiii reported the cross section measurement of @xmath22 at 13 center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energies from 3.9 to 4.2  gev and found the magnitude of the cross sections is at the same order as those of @xmath23 but with a different line shape .",
    "although no quantitative results were given , the resonant structure at around 4.22  gev/@xmath6 is obvious  @xcite",
    ". a combined fit to the besiii data together with the cleo - c measurement at 4.17  gev  @xcite results in a resonant structure , @xmath0 , with a mass of @xmath24 and a width of @xmath25  mev  @xcite , different from any of the known @xmath14 and excited @xmath26 states in this mass region  @xcite .    in 2014 , besiii reported the cross section measurement of @xmath27 at 9 c.m .",
    "energies from 4.21 to 4.42  gev . by assuming the @xmath28 signals come from a single resonance ,",
    "besiii reported a resonant structure with the mass and width of @xmath29  mev/@xmath6 and @xmath30  mev , respectively , and the statistical significance is more than @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "this structure is in good agreement with the @xmath0  observed in @xmath22  @xcite , and combined fits assuming the structures at 4.22  gev/@xmath6 are the same have been tried by the authors of refs .",

    "besiii updated the measurements with higher energy data up to 4.6  gev included , in both @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath28  @xcite processes .",
    "in addition , more data points are added even at low energy , although with low integrated luminosity , to further constraint the line shape in @xmath22  @xcite process . while the structure in @xmath28 mode was affected only slightly with the new measurements at high energies  @xcite , in the @xmath22 mode , the @xmath0",
    "was observed with improved significance together with a new structure , the @xmath32 .",
    "the resonant parameters are @xmath33  mev/@xmath6 and @xmath34  mev for the @xmath0 , and @xmath35  mev/@xmath6 and @xmath36  mev for the @xmath32  @xcite .",

    "energies up to 5.0  gev was first studied by the @xmath42 experiment , where the @xmath10 was observed  @xcite .",
    "belle measured the cross sections of @xmath41 at c.m .",
    "energies between 3.8 and 5.0  gev and reported that only the @xmath10 can not describe the line shape satisfactorily  @xcite .",
    "improved measurements with both @xmath42  @xcite and belle  @xcite full data samples confirmed the existence of non-@xmath10 component in @xmath41 but the line shape was parametrized with different models .",
    "recently , besiii reported a precise measurement of @xmath43 cross sections at c.m .",
    "energies from 3.77 to 4.60  gev ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ omedata ] ) using data samples with an integrated luminosity of 9  fb@xmath39  @xcite .",
    "while the nature of the events at around 4  gev is still ambiguous , the dominant resonant structure , the so called @xmath10 , was found to have a mass of @xmath44  mev/@xmath6 and a width of @xmath45  mev , in good agreement with the @xmath0  observed in @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a new resonance with a mass of around 4.32  gev/@xmath6 is needed to describe the high precision data .",
    "besiii also reported a measurement of the @xmath46 cross sections at c.m .",

    "an obvious feature in the above four channels from the besiii measurements is that there is a common structure at around 4.22  gev/@xmath6 , i.e. , the @xmath0 .",
    "as such a state is not observed in other open charm final states  @xcite , these four final states are probably the dominant decay modes of the @xmath0 . by applying constraints to the resonant parameters in a simultaneous fit to the cross sections of these four processes ,",
    "we may obtain the best knowledge on the @xmath0 , including resonant parameters ( mass , width , coupling to lepton pair , and decay branching fractions ) , and thus a better understanding of its nature  @xcite , especially whether it is an exotic state , such as a tetraquark state in the diquark - antidiquark model  @xcite , a vector molecular state of @xmath49  @xcite , a mixture of two hadrocharmonium states  @xcite , an @xmath50 molecule  @xcite , or a charmonium - hybrid state  @xcite .",

    "we parametrize the cross section with the coherent sum of a few amplitudes , either resonance represented by a breit - wigner ( bw ) function or non - resonant background term parametrized with a phase space term .",
    "the bw function used in this article is @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mass of the resonance ; @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the total width and partial width to @xmath57 , respectively ; @xmath58 is the branching fraction of the resonance decays into final state @xmath59 ; and @xmath60 is the @xmath61body decay phase space factor .    in fitting to the data shown in fig .",

    "we consider the systematic bias introduced by possible additional resonances in the processes under study .",

    "the leptonic decay width for a vector state is an important quantity for distinguishing various theoretical interpretations for the nature of it .",
    "the magnitude of the leptonic decay width determines how the strong decay widths sum up to the total width .",
    "smaller leptonic decay width means that the strong decay widths will be relatively enhanced and vice versa . as the @xmath0  is the dominant component in @xmath23",
    ", we assume the theoretical interpretations on the @xmath10 apply for the @xmath0 .",
    "the recent estimate of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) for the leptonic decay width of the @xmath0  is about 40  ev  @xcite as a feature of the hybrid scenario ; the predicted upper limit of the @xmath0  leptonic decay width is about 500  ev if the @xmath0  is a hadronic molecule dominated by @xmath153  @xcite ; while the leptonic decay width is only about 23  ev for the @xmath154 molecule interpretation  @xcite with no contributions from the open charm decay channel are included in the analysis .",
    "therefore , the experimental extraction of the leptonic decay width for @xmath155 is important for discriminating the @xmath153 molecule , the @xmath154 molecule , and hybrid scenarios .    by considering the isospin symmetric modes of the measured channels",
    ", we can estimate the lower limit on the leptonic partial width of the @xmath0  decays . for an isospin - zero charmoniumlike state",
    ", we expect @xmath156",
    "so we have @xmath157 by plugging in the numbers in table  [ ddpi - table ] , and only taking the solutions with the smallest @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath159 where the first errors are from fit and the second errors are the systematic errors with the uncertainties from different fit scenarios discussed above included .",
    "that is , the lowest value of the @xmath56 of the @xmath0  is around 30  ev .",
    "this lower limit on the leptonic partial width of the @xmath0  is close to the prediction from lqcd for a hybrid vector charmonium state  @xcite .",
    "similarly , taking the solutions with the largest @xmath158 , we have @xmath160  ev assuming the branching fractions of all the other modes are small enough , which is lower than the predicted upper limit from the molecular scenario  @xcite . if we assume these modes saturate the @xmath0  decays , we determine the @xmath0decay branching fractions to the above four modes . for the most interesting mode , @xmath161",

    ".    however , the assumption that the @xmath28 , @xmath47 , @xmath64 , and @xmath48 modes saturate the @xmath0  decays may not be true .",

    "in addition , the decays into open charm final states such as @xmath8 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , @xmath179 are also possible , although the charmed mesons are in relative p - wave .",
    "the @xmath0  is very close to the @xmath180 threshold , the possible coupling to this mode should also be investigated .",
