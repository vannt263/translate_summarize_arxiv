    "jan oort pointed out in 1958 that `` in general , galactic clusters do not appear to grow much older than 0.5 gyrs '' ( oort 1958 ) .",
    "later , wielen ( 1971 ) derived a mean dissolution time of 0.2 gyr from the age distribution of open clusters within about 1 kpc from the sun .",
    "spitzer ( 1958 ) suggested that the short lifetime may be due to the fact that low density clusters ( @xmath10pc@xmath11 ) may be destroyed by encounters with passing interstellar clouds .",
    "the destruction of star clusters occurs in two stages ( see bastian & gieles , these proceedings , for a review . ) : + ( 1 ) at young ages ( @xmath12 10 or 20 myr ) most of the clusters dissolve because the gas that is left over from the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) is removed from the cluster by stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "this loss of binding energy causes a large fraction of the embedded clusters to dissolve into the field .",
    "this `` infant mortality '' ( lada & lada 2003 ) depends critically on the star formation efficiency and appears to be independent of the initial cluster mass . ( bastian et al .",
    "2005 suggest that this occurs within @xmath13 10 myr , whereas fall et al .",
    "2005 suggest that it occurs over a much longer timescale of @xmath13 gyr ) .",
    "theoretical studies , e.g. kroupa & boily ( 2002 ) and references therein , show that the gas removal phase and the resulting infant mortality last about @xmath13 10 myr ( see also lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "+ ( 2 ) at later ages clusters can be destroyed by external effects such as the tidal field , and perturbations due to encounters with gmcs , with spiral arms and the galactic disk .",
    "this effect is mass dependent : massive clusters survive longer than low mass clusters . + this paper deals with the second effect , but we also derive the infant mortality rate for clusters in the solar neighborhood ( sn ) .    starting with the pioneering work of spitzer on the dynamics of star clusters ,",
    "many studies have been devoted to the understanding and prediction of the survival times of clusters open and globular clusters in our galaxy .",
    "these theories predicts that the dissolution time of clusters depends on their initial mass : massive clusters survive longer than low mass clusters ( e.g. spitzer 1958 ; wielen 1985 ; chernoff & weinberg 1990 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "baumgardt & makino ( 2003 ) ( hereafter bm03 ) showed from  simulations that the predicted dissolution time of a cluster in the tidal field of the galaxy depends on the number of stars , @xmath14 , in the cluster as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the coulomb logarithm and the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on the initial concentration of the cluster .",
    "gieles et al .",
    "( 2004 ) showed that this can be written as    @xmath19    with @xmath20 , where  is the disruption time of a cluster with an initial mass @xmath21 .",
    "this same power - law dependence was derived empirically from a study of cluster samples in four galaxies by boutloukos & lamers ( 2003)(hereafter bl03 ) .",
    "the dynamical models of bm03 result in a @xmath22 gyr for clusters in the sn .",
    "since the mean mass of the open clusters in the sn is about a @xmath23 , the `` mean lifetime '' of clusters in the sn , predicted by bm03 , would be a few gyr , i.e. much longer than the empirical value of 0.2 gyr derived by wielen ( 1971 ) .    to solve this discrepancy",
    ", we have started a series of studies of different effects that might play a role in limiting cluster lifetimes .",
    "these effects are : + ( 1 ) mass loss by stellar evolution , + ( 2 ) dissolution by two - body relaxation in the tidal field of the galaxy , + ( 3 ) perturbations due to the passage of spiral arms , + ( 4 ) perturbations due to encounters with gmcs .",
    "+ at the same time we rederived empirically the cluster dissolution times of open clusters in the sn , based on the new cluster sample of kharchenko et al .",
    "we compare the predicted and the observed age distributions in clusters to see which one of the possible destruction mechanisms is the most important one in the sn .",
    "this comparison also results in an estimate of the star formation rate and infant mortality rate .",
    "( for the full study , see lamers & gieles 2006 . )",
    "kharchenko et al . ( 2005 ) published a catalog of 520 galactic open clusters in the sn with the values of angular sizes of cluster cores and coronae , heliocentric distances @xmath24 , @xmath25 , mean proper motions , radial velocities and ages .",
    "these parameters have been determined by homogeneous methods and algorithms including a careful procedure of cluster member selection .",
    "the basis of this study is the ascc-2.5 - all - sky compiled catalog of about 2.5 million stars down to @xmath26 ( completeness limit at @xmath27 ) , with proper motions and @xmath28 magnitudes based on the @xmath29 data and supplemented with @xmath30 data and some ground - based catalogs .",
    "cluster membership is based on a combined probability which takes into account kinematic ( proper motion ) , photometric and spatial selection criteria .",
    "cluster ages were determined with an isochrone - based procedure which provides a uniform age scale .",
    "this resulted in the most homogeneous catalog of open clusters in the sn .",
    "lamers et al .",
    "2005a ( l05 ) have shown that the lower mass limit of the clusters in the kharchenko et al .",
    "sample is about 100 .",
    "figure [ fig : distance ] shows the distance distribution of the density of clusters projected onto the galactic plane , in number per pc@xmath31 . within the statistical uncertainty",
    "the surface density is constant up to at least 600 pc .",
    "the lower part of the figure shows the ratio between old ( @xmath32 gyr ) and young ( @xmath33 gyr ) clusters as a function of distance .",
    "up to a distance of about 1 kpc there is no significant change in this ratio within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "this is important for our study because it shows that the sample of clusters within 600 pc has no age bias .",
    "figure [ fig : kharchenko_age ] shows the age distribution in number per year of the 114 clusters within 600 pc in the kharchenko sample .",
    "this distribution decreases with age , apart from a small local maximum around @xmath34 .",
    "the distribution at young ages is sensitive to the choice of the age - bins and shows a significant scatter .",
    "the steep slope at @xmath35 demonstrates that cluster disruption is important .",
    "the stellar mass loss from clusters has been calculated by various groups .",
    "we adopt the @xmath36 models for clusters with a salpeter type mass function in the range of @xmath37 ( anders & fritze - v .",
    "alvensleben 2003 ) .",
    "these models are based on stellar evolution tracks from the padova group , which include overshooting , mass loss due to stellar winds and supernovae . l05",
    "have shown that the fraction of the initial cluster mass that is lost by stellar evolution , @xmath38 , can be approximated accurately by    @xmath39    with @xmath40 in yrs and @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 for solar metallicity models with a salpeter mass function .",
    "this function describes the mass loss of the models at @xmath44 myr with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the mass loss at younger ages is negligible because stars with @xmath45 hardly contribute to the mass of the cluster due to the small number of stars .",
    "( these stars do play an important role in the infant mortality because they are responsible for the fast removal of the gas from the clusters . ) the mass loss from clusters by stellar evolution can then be described as    @xmath46      bm03 have calculated a grid of  simulations of clusters in circular and elliptical orbits in the tidal field of a galaxy for different initial cluster masses , galactocentric distances @xmath47 , and different cluster density profiles .",
    "the stars follow a kroupa initial mass function without primordial binaries , and stellar evolution is taken into account during the evolution . bm03 and lamers et al .",
    "( 2005b ) have shown that the predicted dissolution time can be expressed as a function of the initial cluster mass as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is a constant that depends on the tidal field strength of the galaxy in which the cluster moves and on the ellipticity of its orbit .",
    "we adopt the value of @xmath50 yr from bm03 for clusters in circular orbits at @xmath51 kpc . applying this result of bm03 to clusters in the sn , which are on average of lower mass than considered in their study , results in an overestimation of the dissolution time of low mass clusters by less than a factor 2 or so ( see fig . 5 of bm03 ) .",
    "this is because low mass clusters , with total lifetimes less than about a gyr , contain massive stars during most of their lifetime .",
    "these stars are very efficient in ejecting stars by two - body interactions .",
    "the mass loss due to the galactic tidal field can then be written as    @xmath52      when clusters cross a spiral arm , the enhancement of the ambient density gives rise to time dependent tidal forces that can accelerate stars out of the cluster .",
    "these external perturbations are most destructive for clusters with low density and for passages with low relative velocity , @xmath53 .",
    "the solar neighborhood is close to the corotation radius of the spiral arms , where the effect is largest .",
    "although the time between spiral arm passages at that location is long , @xmath54 , the mass loss per passage is high , i.e. @xmath55 ( gieles et al .",
    "2006a , hereafter gapz06 ) .",
    "gapz06 calculated the dissolution time of clusters in the sn due to perturbations by spiral arms by means of n - body simulations .",
    "for the density of the clusters , they adopted the observed mean mass - radius relation of clusters as observed in nearby spiral galaxies by larsen ( 2004 ) : @xmath56 with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the half mass radius .",
    "here we have converted the cluster radius @xmath59 given by larsen into the halfmass radius @xmath60 using @xmath61 ( spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "for a density contrast of the gas component of the spiral arms based on observations , and a mean drift velocity of @xmath62 ( dias & lpine 2005 ) , gapz06 found a mean dissolution time of    @xmath63    notice that for @xmath64 the disruption time due to shocking by spiral arms has almost the same mass dependence , i.e. @xmath65 , as that due to the tidal field ( bm03 ) and as found empirically ( bl03 ) , viz .",
    "@xmath66 .",
    "the mass loss of clusters due to spiral arm shocks is    @xmath67      spitzer ( 1958 ) suspected already that encounters with gmcs play an important role in the destruction of clusters in the sn . similar to the case of spiral arm perturbations ,",
    "the disruptive effect of the encounters depends on the density of the star cluster and on the relative velocity between the cluster and the cloud .",
    "however in the case of an encounter with a gmc , the mass loss also depends on the mass of the gmc and on the distance of the passage at the moment of closest approach .",
    "this implies of course that the dissolution of clusters due to encounters with gmcs can only be described in a statistical way , when all effects are properly averaged over the encounter probabilities .",
    "gieles et al .",
    "( 2006b , gpzb06 ) studied the encounters between gmcs and clusters with @xmath14-body simulations .",
    "they showed that the relative mass loss due to a shock , i.e. @xmath68 , is only about 20 % of the relative energy gain @xmath69 .",
    "this is because a large fraction ( @xmath13 80 % ) of the energy gained in an encounter goes into ejecting stars with a velocity exceeding the escape velocity .",
    "this implies that the disruption time should _ not _ be defined as the timescale for injecting the same energy as the cluster binding energy ( e.g. ostriker et al . 1972 ) , but as the time scale to bring the cluster mass to zero .",
    "the disruption time of clusters by encounters with gmcs does not depend on the mass of the individual clouds , but only on the _ mean density of molecular gas _ in the sn .",
    "this is because the energy gained by the cluster per individual encounter is proportional to the cloud mass @xmath70 , but the number of encounters per unit time depends on the number density of the clouds .",
    "the number density times the mass of the clouds is the mean density of the molecular gas .",
    "in other words : 1000 clouds of @xmath71 have statistically the same disruptive effect as 10 clouds of @xmath72 if we ignore the tidal field ( but see  3.5 ) .",
    "gpzb06 derived an expression for the energy gain and the resulting mass loss for the full range of encounter distances , from head - on to distant encounters .",
    "they adopted a mean midplane density of molecular gas in gmcs near the sun of @xmath73pc@xmath11 , a surface density of individual gmcs of @xmath74 pc@xmath5 ( solomon et al .",
    "1987 ) and a mean velocity dispersion of clusters and gmcs of @xmath75 .    with these data they derived a mean dissolution time ( @xmath76 ) for clusters by gmc encounters in the sn , taking into account the relative velocity distribution , the distribution of impact parameters and gravitational focusing .",
    "adopting the mean mass radius relation of clusters ( larsen 2004 ) ( see  3.3 ) they found    @xmath77    the statistical mass loss rate of a cluster due to encounters with gmcs is    @xmath78    notice that the mass dependence is the same as for dissolution by spiral arm shocking , but that the effect is ten times stronger .",
    "the mass loss from clusters , due to the combined effects of stellar evolution , tidal stripping , spiral arm shocks and encounters with gmcs , is    @xmath79    in writing this expression we assumed that the four effects act independently of one another",
    ". this may not be the case .",
    "for instance , a cluster that has encountered a gmc has an increased radius and is thus more susceptible to tidal stripping than a cluster that did not have a recent encounter .",
    "however , we expect this effect to be small , except for the lowest mass clusters",
    ".    we have solved eq .",
    "[ eq : dmpdt ] numerically for clusters of different masses .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for clusters with an initial mass of @xmath23 and @xmath80 .",
    "notice that encounters with gmcs are the dominant dissolution effect in the solar neighborhood , contributing as much as the three other effects combined . using the calculated mass decrease of clusters of different initial mass we can predict the age of the cluster when it has a remaining mass of 100 , i.e. the detection limit for clusters in the sn in the kharchenko sample ( see l05 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:6 ] shows the ages of clusters when their remaining mass is 0 and 100  as a function of the initial mass .",
    "the almost linear part can be described by    @xmath81    the steep decrease at low mass is because clusters with @xmath82   quickly reach the detection limit of @xmath83 .",
    "the figure also shows the dissolution times by the galactic tidal field , predicted by bm03 for clusters with an initial concentration factor @xmath84 in a circular orbit at @xmath51 kpc and the empirical value of  from l05 .",
    "our predicted timescales are about a factor 5 smaller than those due the tidal field only ( bm03 ) but agree with the empirical value ( l05 ) .",
    "given the initial mass distribution of the clusters , their formation rate , cfr@xmath85 , and the time it takes for a dissolving cluster to fade below the detection limit , we can predict the distribution of observable clusters as function of age or mass . here",
    "we are interested in a sample of clusters with @xmath86 .    for a constant cfr and a power law cluster imf with a slope of @xmath87 (",
    "lada & lada 2003 ) the number of clusters with @xmath88 as function of age is    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the _ initial _ mass of clusters that reach @xmath91 at age @xmath40 .",
    "clusters of age @xmath40 with a smaller initial mass have @xmath92 by now .",
    "@xmath93 is the maximum _ initial _ mass of the clusters that are formed .",
    "the constant @xmath94 is related to the star formation rate ( sfr ) in bound clusters as @xmath95 for @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig:7 ] shows a comparison between the observed age distribution of clusters within 600 pc with the predicted distribution for @xmath96 .",
    "this value of  is adopted because the observed distribution shows a steep drop at @xmath97 ( with only one cluster in the last bin ) and fig . [ fig:7 ] shows that this corresponds to @xmath98 .",
    "the flattening of the predicted distribution at the low age end is due to the fact that clusters with an initial mass in the range of about 100 to 300  quickly reach 100  ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] ) .",
    "the bump in the observed distribution around @xmath99 is due to a local starburst ( see l05 and piskunov et al .",
    "there is good agreement in the shapes of the predicted and observed distributions !",

    "our value is a factor 2 to 3 smaller than the lower limit of lada & lada and a factor 10 to 20 smaller than the one derived by miller & scalo .",
    "this implies that at least @xmath1370 and possibly even 0.95 % of the stars in the sn are born in clusters that dissolve within @xmath13 10 myr .",
    "our calculated dissolution times of clusters in the solar neighborhood are about a factor five smaller than predicted by bm03 for clusters in the tidal field of our galaxy , with only stellar evolution , binaries and two - body relaxation taken into account .",
    "this is mainly due to encounters with gmcs .",
    "so we can expect that clusters in environments with a high density of gmcs will be destroyed very effectively .",

    "this is a curious statement because the embedded clusters are all younger than 3 myr and the large majority of these clusters will not survive infant mortality ( lada & lada 2003 ) .",
