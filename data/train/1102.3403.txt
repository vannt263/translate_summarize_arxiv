    "this shift is precisely due to the fact that the exchange field enters as a vector potential and thus gives rise to an effective flux along the edge .",
    "we note in passing that in the non - thermalized regime , it is possible to obtain a 4@xmath51-periodic cpr on a topological surface @xcite .    the self - consistent microscopic results for non - zero @xmath52 and @xmath53 is shown figs .  [ fig : cpr](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "a finite @xmath52-field causes majorana modes to appear at the s@xmath1f interfaces @xcite and we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : cpr](a ) results for both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we clearly see that @xmath56 is shifted down toward @xmath57 for both cases .",
    "we attribute this shift to a significant amount of ipe , as seen in the inset .",
    "in fact , processes influencing the s regions are known to shift @xmath56 below the standard value of @xmath57 in conventional s@xmath1n@xmath1s junctions @xcite . here",
    "we see a similar shift but starting from the non - self - consistent solution at @xmath48 . to support this conclusion",
    "we show in the dashed lines the cpr after the first step of the self - consistency loop , starting from the analytical @xmath35 step - function solution .",
    "already after one iteration we see that @xmath56 is significantly reduced while at the same time a sizable ipe has appeared .",
    "we can quantify the ipe by fitting @xmath21 close to the interface to the form @xmath58 .",
    "as expected , the decay length @xmath59 is linearly proportional to @xmath60 , although the linear coefficient is somewhat dependent on both @xmath25 and @xmath52 , but not on @xmath61 . thus , by varying @xmath60 we can significantly modify the ipe and for very short @xmath60 we indeed see @xmath56 increasing , but never fully to @xmath51 . on the other hand , we only achieve @xmath62 due to current depairing @xcite , which is only present in artificially short junctions .",
    "therefore , for any experimental junction , where @xmath60 is significantly larger than we can model , we predict @xmath63 .",
    "figure [ fig : cpr](b ) shows the results for finite @xmath53-fields .",
    "there are no majorana fermions appearing for this field direction , but still , a @xmath53-field has interesting consequences for the cpr .",
    "as predicted analytically , we see a linear shift in @xmath56 with @xmath53 and @xmath25 , however , the linear coefficient is @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , we again see @xmath63 , and not @xmath51 , in the limit of zero field .",
    "the self - consistent cpr with a @xmath53-field can thus , up to numerical accuracy , be written as @xmath65 .",
    "we also see a shift in @xmath66 with @xmath53 ( but not @xmath25 ) , such that @xmath67 .",
    "such a dependence is not seen in the analytical solution but can be traced back to a changed ipe .",
    "in fact , when the ipe increases , we see a concurrent drop of both @xmath66 and @xmath56 , which can also explain the larger linear coefficient for the field - induced phase shift than found analytically .",
    "the direct coupling between the superconducting phase difference and the exchange - field offers an interesting opportunity : _ supercurrent - induced magnetization dynamics_. by biasing the system with a supercurrent , one would expect to see a time - evolution of the magnetic order parameter . to address this issue",
    ", we make use of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation @xcite ( the modification of the llg equation on a topological surface in the presence of a single - particle charge - current was recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the magnetization vector , @xmath70 , @xmath71 is the gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath72 is the gilbert damping constant .",
    "the components of the effective field are obtained from the free energy @xmath73 of the system via : @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the volume of the f region . in what follows ,",
    "we investigate how an equilibrium supercurrent can induce strong magnetization dynamics in the present system .",
    "thus , we focus on the effect of the andreev - bound states , the rationale being that it is precisely this contribution that constitutes the josephson - current induced magnetization dynamics , and assume that other contributions such as anisotropy fields can be neglected .",
    "we underline the fact that the analytical expression for the bound - states captures the field - dependence exhibited by the effective superconducting phase difference , as also confirmed by our self - consistent results , which is the key to the supercurrent - induced magnetization dynamics . obtaining the free energy from @xmath76 $ ]",
    ", one may rewrite the llg equation in the convenient dimensionless form : @xmath77 , where we have defined @xmath78 , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the josephson frequency , and finally : @xmath81 , @xmath82 here , @xmath83 and @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "the inverse temperature is @xmath86 , and we set @xmath87 .    we have solved the above llg equation numerically to simulate the magnetization dynamics induced by a josephson current . it should be noted that a josephson current does not induce magnetization dynamics in a conventional s@xmath1f@xmath1s junction , whereas this feature appears in the present context due to the dirac - like dispersion with momentum - spin locking for the topological edge states .",
    "let us estimate the magnitude of the parameters entering in the expressions for @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the proximity induced superconducting gap is taken to be small , @xmath90 mev , and we also make a conservative assumption for the exchange field , @xmath91 mev ( ref",
    ".   would induce an exchange energy @xmath92 mev / t ) in the edge - states . ] ) .",
    "the length @xmath25 of the junction can be varied experimentally , but is here fixed to @xmath93 nm . we use a typical value for the josephson frequency , @xmath94 ghz .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 is phenomenological , and we will contrast the small damping scenario @xmath95 with strong damping @xmath96 . we also treat @xmath97 as a free parameter to vary , since the exact values of @xmath98 and @xmath75 will differ depending on the specific materials and dimensions chosen .",
    "when @xmath99 , the effective field in the junction is reduced and the magnetization dynamics vanishes .",
    "therefore , we here set @xmath100 and compare in fig .",
    "[ fig : magdyn ] the case of weak ( @xmath101 ) and strong ( @xmath102 ) damping .",
    "the initial condition is chosen to have the magnetization @xmath103 , i.e. in the plane of the topological insulator . in the weak damping regime ,",
    "the magnetization oscillates unabatedly as @xmath104 increases ( only the main periodic pattern is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : magdyn ] for clarity ) . for larger",
    "damping , the dynamics becomes more interesting .",
    "in this case , it is seen how the @xmath44-component becomes dominant and how the oscillation of the other components slowly decay as @xmath104 increases .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the magnetization will saturate on a shorter time - scale when @xmath95 is no longer satisfied .",
    "in fact , the right panel of fig . [",
    "fig : magdyn ] suggests that _ supercurrent - induced magnetization switching _ might be possible : the magnetization starts out @xmath103 , but is seen to converge toward @xmath105 as @xmath104 increases . an important point with respect to the presence of an exchange field in the @xmath44-direction",
    "is that the ground - state superconducting phase difference @xmath106 no longer is @xmath107 or @xmath108 , as in conventional metallic systems . instead , the ground - state phase is now given by @xmath109 .",
    "this is similar to the scenario of a noncentrosymmetric ferromagnet in a josephson junction @xcite , although the origin of the @xmath106-state here is completely different .",
    "we also note that the same magnetization dynamics effect would be present on the surface of three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological insulators , possibly exerting stronger dynamics in magnitude in that case due to the larger number of andreev - bound states carrying current .",
    "finally , it should be noted that we have assumed that the magnetic anisotropy energy is small enough to be negligible , which places restrictions on which type of materials that may be used for this purpose .",
    "this fact notwithstanding , the principle of supercurrent - induced magnetization dynamics would remain possible due to the renormalized phase - difference .",
    "our self - consistent solution also offers access to various properties of the majorana fermions which appear at the s@xmath1f interfaces at finite @xmath52-fields .",
    "here we concentrate on their spatial extension ( i.e. the degree of localization to the s@xmath1f interface ) at @xmath110 .",
    "this property is important for any experimental scheme aimed at exploiting their non - abelian properties through braiding .",
    "note that we are here not concerned with their spread into the qshi as that is set by the width of the edge state and is therefore very narrow . in a s@xmath1f@xmath1s junction",
    ", the two majorana fermions appear as two in - gap , near - zero energy solutions with eigenenergies @xmath111 and eigenvectors @xmath112 , where particle - hole symmetry dictates @xmath113 .",
    "a finite @xmath25 gives rise to a finite mixing between the two majorana modes which , at @xmath110 , leaves a non - zero @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "also , the two eigenvectors contain an equal mixture of the two majorana modes living at the two separate interfaces .",
    "but , by defining the vectors @xmath114 and @xmath115 , with a variable @xmath116 , we can always isolate each majorana mode , which then also explicitly displays their @xmath117 majorana nature . by studying the ( normalized ) density @xmath118",
    ", we find that the spatial extent of the majorana mode on the s side of the sf interface is only a function of @xmath60 , whereas on the f side it is only a function of @xmath52 .",
    "notably , we find no significant dependence on @xmath61 or @xmath25 .",
    "figure [ fig : maj](a ) shows the decay of the majorana mode into the s region for a few representative values of @xmath60 .",
    "note that the slight difference in the curves on the f side for different @xmath60 is solely due to the normalization constraint , giving different peak heights at the interface .",
    "the decay on the s side can to good accuracy be approximated as an exponential decay with a decay length @xmath119 .",
    "we find that @xmath120 for all junctions we have studied ( see inset ) .",
    "this decay length is similar to @xmath59 and one could speculate that the majorana mode extends into the ipe depression region of the superconducting order parameter",
    ". however , @xmath59 also has a moderate dependence on @xmath25 and @xmath52 varies from @xmath121 to a @xmath122 when @xmath25 is increased from 8 to 24 . ] which @xmath119 does not .",
    "thus the majorana decay into the s region is not solely governed by the ipe although the two show a strong correlation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : maj](b ) we show a similar set of data for the decay of @xmath118 on the f side of the junction for different values of @xmath52 . as seen in the inset , we find a non - linear dependence on @xmath52 for @xmath123 ( or the energy gap produced in the edge state due to @xmath52 ) although it is monotonic .    in summary",
