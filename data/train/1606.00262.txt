    "besides the well - known turing patterns , reaction - diffusion ( rd ) systems possess a rich variety of self - organized spatio - temporal wave patterns including traveling fronts , solitary excitation pulses , and periodic pulse trains in one - dimensional media .",
    "these patterns are `` building blocks '' of traveling wave patterns like target patterns , wave segments , and spiral waves @xcite in two and scroll waves @xcite in three spatial dimensions , respectively . traveling waves ( tw ) have been observed in many physical @xcite , biological @xcite , and chemical systems @xcite .",
    "prominent examples of front propagation include catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide on platinum single crystal surfaces @xcite , arrays of coupled chemical reactors @xcite , and combustion reactions in condensed two - phase systems @xcite .",
    "moreover , the phenomenon of pulse propagation is associated with a large class of problems , including information processing in nervous systems @xcite , migraine aura dynamics @xcite , coordination of heart beat @xcite , and spatial spread of diseases @xcite . + in many systems , the excitable medium supporting wave propagation exhibits a complex shape and/or is limited in size . in such cases , geometric restrictions can effect the rd processes , leading to complex wave phenomena , e.g. intracellular calcium wave patterns during fertilization of sea urchin eggs @xcite and in protoplasmic droplets of physarum polycephalum @xcite , pattern formation in the cell cortex @xcite , turing patterns in microemulsion systems @xcite , drastic lifetime enhancement of scroll waves @xcite , and atrial arrhythmia @xcite .",
    "in particular , there is experimental evidence that spatial variations of the atrial wall thickness is a significant cause of scroll wave drift @xcite as well as anchoring @xcite ; both promoting atrial fibrillation @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been reported that the dendritic shape of nerve cells strongly affects the propagation of the cellular action potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the interaction of particles with porous boundaries can cause effects like adsorption and therefore influence the properties of diffusive transport .",
    "modeling irregularities of micropores as entropic barriers , it was shown that the interplay of diffusion and boundary - induced adsorption can be described via an effective diffusion coefficient @xcite .",

    "+ in our recent work @xcite , we have provided a first systematic treatment of how propagation of traveling waves in thin three - dimensional channels with periodically varying cross - section can be reduced to a corresponding one - dimensional reaction - diffusion - advection equation ( rdae ) . using projection method ,",
    "we have derived an equation of motion for the position of tws as a function of time in the presence of the boundary - induced advection term and obtained an analytical expression for the average propagation velocity .",
    "taking the schlgl model for describing front dynamics , our theoretical results predict boundary - induced propagation failure being confirmed by finite element simulations of the three - dimensional rd dynamics .",

    "pulses are initiated at one side of the tube by setting the activator values within an interval of the free pulse width @xmath197 to @xmath154 for one time - step @xmath129 .",
    "no - flux bcs in @xmath11-direction and a fixed activator value , equal to the rest state , at the very left of the tube will cause the initiation of pulse propagation . then , after each integer multiple of the time difference @xmath205 , a pulse is initiated in the same manner .",
    "@xmath0  [ fig : pulsetrains ] depicts the dependence of the period @xmath206 , defined as the time difference between pulses exiting the bottleneck , on the period @xmath205 of the entering pulse train and the corrugation parameter @xmath144 .",

    "right panel @xmath208 : results from the numerical solution of the rdae , @xmath25  .",
    "the diffusion coefficients are set to @xmath209 . ]",
    "one observes a very good agreement of the results of the full numerical simulations , @xmath0  [ fig : pulsetrains]a ) , and the solution of the rdae , @xmath0  [ fig : pulsetrains]b ) .",
    "both show that for small bottleneck widths , e.g. @xmath210 the ratio @xmath211 of the periods is zero for all initial time differences @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "this is related to a situation in which all pulses get pinned at the bottleneck and finally disappear . for periods",
    "@xmath213 the pulse trains become unstable and pulses vanish even within the plain section of the tube .",
    "this fact finds verification in the numerical results , as even for broad bottlenecks the ratio @xmath211 does not reach unity if @xmath205 is too small . for instance , at periods @xmath214 every second pulse vanishes and one observes a doubling of periods even before the pulses approach the bottleneck . for large periods of the entering pulse train , @xmath215",
    ", the pulses can be approximately regarded as non - interacting single pulses .",
    "if the corrugation is weak enough ( @xmath216 ) a single pulse is able to pass the bottleneck and so are all others of the pulse train , and hence @xmath217 . for decreasing values of the entering period , the interaction of the pulses within the pulse train can no longer be neglected .",
    "one observes parameter regions with ratios @xmath218 .",
    "also there are minor regimes in which different ratios such as @xmath219 occur .",
    "as it can be seen in the rdae , @xmath25  , the adoption of the pulse shape to the boundary s curvature , which is also related to the critical nucleation size after narrow gaps @xcite , causes the pulses front velocities to decrease in the broadening section of the tube and the pulses back becomes decelerated while entering the bottleneck .",
    "when the next pulse approaches the region behind the previous one , it is only able to excite the medium after a given refractory time .",
    "if , due to an incomplete recovery in the pulse s refractory tail , the region is still non - excitable after the previous pulse passed the section , the following pulse vanishes and , hence , a period change occurs .",
    "similar effects were observed in experiments and described by toth et al .",
    "@xcite who investigated the propagation of waves in the belousov - zhabotinsky reaction through narrow tubes connecting two reservoirs .    in addition",
    ", we want to stress that comparing the results for pulse trains with those for solitary pulses one realizes a difference in occurrence of pf . for @xmath220 , pf of a single pulse occurs if @xmath221 , but for the same parameters , no pulses in a pulse train can pass the single bottleneck if @xmath222 .",
    "this condition even holds for large periods @xmath223 and so it must be an effect of the chosen geometries . as mentioned above ,",
    "the pulses velocity is increased in the narrowing part of the modulation and decreased if the tube expands again .",
    "if the tube exhibits an ongoing periodic modulation , the pulse senses partly an increase and a decrease of its velocity .",
    "otherwise , if the modulation ends after a section of expanding , the pulse mainly interacts with the part of the geometry that causes a decrease of velocity . in consequence , for waves it is harder to overcome the end of a modulation , where the tube s radial extend is maximal , instead of an ongoing equivalent periodic variation of the cross section .",
    "in this work , we have investigated propagation of reaction - diffusion waves through rotationally symmetric tubes with no - flux boundaries and modulated cross section .",
    "first , we have presented a systematic treatment of reaction - diffusion equations within such tubes by performing a multiple scale analysis to reduce the effectively two - dimensional reaction - diffusion equation to a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion - advection equation .",
    "+ in a second step , we have obtained an analytic expression for wave velocities within the aforementioned geometries , using projection method .",
    "moreover , we have presented a handy approach for numerical simulation of the reaction - diffusion equation within irregular geometries based on a coordinate transformation onto a rectangular integration regime .    exemplarily using the fitzhugh - nagumo model ,",
    "we have studied the propagation of traveling front and pulse solutions in a sinusoidally modulated tube . in particular , intervals of propagation failure",
    "are found for sufficiently strong tube modulations .",
    "these finite intervals are located in parameter regions where the modulation s period length @xmath3 and the front width @xmath39 , respectively the activator pulse s front width @xmath52 , are of the same order of magnitude . in the limit of narrow front widths , @xmath224 or @xmath225 , the wave velocities approach the free propagation velocities for any finite bottleneck width , whereas in the limit of large front widths , @xmath226 or @xmath227 , the wave velocities saturate at values below the free velocity .",
    "these velocities depend crucially on the geometry , and the boundaries influence can be incorporated in a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion equation via an effective diffusion coefficient which can be calculated using the lifson - jackson formula @xcite . for our considerations",
    "we have chosen to tune the chemical length scale instead of the modulation s period to ensure the smallness of the geometric expansion parameter @xmath79 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : analytics ] .",
    "nevertheless , we emphasize that one obtains similar results by adjusting the geometric length scale instead ; the latter might be easier to access in most experimental realizations .",
    "further , we want to highlight the very good agreement of the solutions of the derived reaction - diffusion - advection equation and the numerical simulations of the full system regarding the wave velocities within the modulated tubes .",
    "additionally , with a few limitations , in case of front propagation , the analytically obtained approximate solution of the reaction - diffusion - advection equation predicts well the front velocities .    regarding periodic pulse trains ,",
    "we have studied the influence of a single sinusoidal bottleneck on the pulse train s period .",
    "dependent on the bottleneck width and the period of the entering pulse trains , one observes different ratios of the period of exiting pulse trains to the period of entering pulse trains . due to changes in the velocity of pulse propagation at the bottleneck",
    ", subsequent pulses can reach the medium ahead before it returned to the excitable state after the previous pulse went by .",
    "this causes the pulse to vanish and therefore the pulse train s period will increase by integer ratios of the entering period .",
    "noteworthy , the results of the full numerical simulations and the solution of the reaction - diffusion - advection equation exhibit a very good agreement .",
