    "the remarkable success of the mean - field bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory in describing classic superconductors @xcite may be attributed to the fact that an infinitesimal attraction between electrons suffices to form cooper pairs responsible for superconductivity.@xcite on the other hand , we now have an increasing number of superconductors and fermi superfluids where relevant interactions are stronger beyond the applicability of the mean - field theory .",
    "they include superfluid @xmath2he at high pressure , @xcite heavy - fermion superconductors with competing fluctuations,@xcite high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors,@xcite and the bcs - bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) crossover in trapped atomic gases.@xcite the present paper is devoted to developing a convenient systematic method to describe those systems based on many - body quantum field theory .    to be specific , we will focus on a two - body interaction and extend the luttinger - ward self - consistent perturbation expansion for normal states@xcite to superconductors in such a way that , given a normal - state approximation , all the pair ( i.e. , `` anomalous '' ) processes derivable from it are automatically incorporated . reproducing the hartree - fock theory as the lowest - order approximation , the luttinger - ward formalism enables us to include correlation effects systematically and microscopically up to a desired order .",
    "its key ingredient is a functional @xmath4 $ ] of the single - particle green s function @xmath5 described by closed skeleton feynman diagrams , as properly identified and called `` @xmath6-derivable approximations '' by baym.@xcite indeed , choosing an approximate @xmath6 enables us to calculate the whole thermodynamic series ranging from the thermodynamic potential and single - particle green s function to the two - particle and higher - order green s functions.@xcite to put it another way , @xmath6 uniquely determines how to resolve the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy.@xcite an additional prominent advantage of the formalism is that it automatically satisfies conservation laws , as shown by baym .",
    "@xcite hence , one can also study non - equilibrium phenomena by only changing the imaginary - time matsubara contour into the real - time schwinger - keldysh contour .",
    "@xcite    it should be noted that a formal extension of the luttinger - ward theory to superconductors was performed by de dominicis and martin already in 1964.@xcite however , they did not present any practical method of how to efficiently collect pair processes with anomalous green s functions , whose number grows exponentially in comparison with normal diagrams as we proceed to higher orders .",
    "for example , ( a)-(j ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] exhaust the third - order diagrams for @xmath6 in terms of the symmetrized vertex @xmath7 of abrikosov _",
    "et al_.,@xcite where anomalous diagrams ( c)-(j ) are already four times as large in number as normal diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) .    .",
    "a square ( a small circle ) represents the bare vertex @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) that is symmetric in the space - spin coordinates ( both the space - spin coordinates and particle - hole indices ) .",
    "the number below each of diagrams ( a)-(j ) denotes its relative weight .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    here , we develop a perturbation expansion of gathering all the pair processes systematically and concisely without drawing anomalous diagrams for both the singlet and triplet pairings or their mixtures .",
    "this is made possible by introducing a bare interaction vertex @xmath8 that is further symmetrized in the particle - hole ( i.e. , creation - annihilation or `` charge '' ) indices .",
    "thus , processes ( a)-(j ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be represented by a single diagram on the right - hand side with a definite analytic expression , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ phi_3 ] ) below , which reproduces their weights correctly .",
    "the key functional @xmath6 is defined as a closed skeleton expansion in terms of the matrix green s function @xmath1 in the nambu space , which may be approximated by some selected terms from the whole series in practical calculations .",
    "besides the dyson - gorkov equation for @xmath1 and an expression of the thermodynamic potential , we also derive the bethe - salpeter equation for the two - particle green s function that can be solved based solely on @xmath6 .",
    "the formalism enables us to study not only superconductivity itself but also competing effects of charge , spin , and superconducting fluctuations or orders simultaneously through the matrix structure of @xmath8 .",
    "this last point may be regarded as a definite advantage of the present approach over the one based on the stratonovich - hubbard transformation,@xcite where only a single fluctuation relevant to the auxiliary field may be taken into account after some standard approximation .    using the formalism",
    ", we also extend the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation originally developed for normal states@xcite so as to incorporate all the pair processes for the spin - singlet pairing .",
    "the flex approximation has been successful in describing anomalous normal - state transport phenomena of high-@xmath3 superconductors as well as some organic and heavy - fermion superconductors.@xcite its extension to superconductivity as described above , which has not been performed yet and will be called `` flex - s approximation '' below , will be useful for understanding those superconductors quantitatively .",
    "this will be carried out in a transparent and concise manner in terms of @xmath8 in contrast to the original derivation for normal states.@xcite    naturally , considerable efforts have been made to go beyond the bcs theory .",
    "eliashberg incorporated the electron - phonon interaction explicitly as the source of the attraction to derive `` strong - coupling '' equations of superconductivity within the second - order perturbation in terms of the renormalized electron green s function and bare phonon propagator.@xcite leggett seriously considered interactions between particles other than the pairing part to develop a theory of superfluid fermi liquids at low temperatures.@xcite anderson and brinkman @xcite presented the idea of `` feedback effects , '' i.e. , a change of the pairing interaction through the superfluid transition , to understand the a phase of superfluid @xmath9he that is realized against the mean - field balian - werthamer theory.@xcite the idea was elaborated by brinkman _ et al_.  @xcite and kuroda,@xcite who both incorporated the first few anomalous processes into the normal - state pairing interaction composed of the particle - hole `` paramagnon '' diagrams@xcite and evaluated the extra free energy as a power series in the @xmath10-wave energy gaps .",
    "subsequently , tewordt @xcite refined this approach into a self - consistent @xmath6-derivable approximation , where he included those pair processes that can be obtained from the normal particle - hole diagrams by successively replacing a pair of normal green s functions connecting adjacent vertices by a pair of anomalous green s functions ; relevant diagrams in the third order are ( a ) , ( c ) , ( f ) , and ( j ) of fig .",
    "tewordt and coworkers@xcite later applied the formalism to the two - dimensional hubbard model to clarify quasiparticle and spin excitations of high-@xmath11 superconductors .",
    "the same formalism was used by other groups for the two - dimensional hubbard model@xcite and @xmath12-@xmath10 model.@xcite on the other hand , eagles@xcite and leggett@xcite discussed the bcs - bec crossover of the isotropic spin - singlet pairing at zero temperature by combining the bcs gap equation with the equation for the chemical potential .",
    "the transition temperature of the bcs - bec crossover problem was calculated subsequently by nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite based on the thouless criterion.@xcite haussmann and coworkers@xcite studied this problem with an improved @xmath6-derivable approximation to include interaction effects among unpaired and paired fermions . specifically , their @xmath6 consists of the normal particle - particle ladder diagrams appropriate for low - density systems , plus those anomalous processes obtained from the formers by successively replacing two pairs of normal green s functions connecting adjacent vertices by two pairs of anomalous green s functions ; relevant diagrams in the third order are ( b ) and ( h ) of fig .  1 , disregarding ( e ) and ( g ) which may be important even within the ladder approximation .",
    "we should also mention an alternative approach on the issue where some effective pairing interaction is used to solve the eliashberg equations.@xcite however , there is an ambiguity as to how to construct the effective interaction .",
    "similarly , the flex approximation has sometimes been augmented rather phenomenologically to explain the pseudogap phenomena observed in underdoped cuprate superconductors.@xcite to be specific , the `` flex+t - matrix '' approximation@xcite consists of ( i ) identifying the pairing interaction obtained by the flex approximation as the `` bare '' interaction in the thouless criterion and ( ii ) incorporating the contribution of the two - particle `` superconducting fluctuations '' additionally into the single - particle self - energy .",
    "however , the procedure may contain some double counting of elementary processes and has yet to be examined on a firm microscopic basis .",
    "note in this context that the thouless criterion was originally derived by the particle - particle ladder approximation in the bare perturbation expansion for a two - particle green s function,@xcite reproducing the same @xmath11 equation as the mean - field bcs theory .",
    "thus , one may be convinced that we still do not have practical methods of incorporating all the anomalous processes that are naturally present below @xmath11 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we develop a basic formalism to calculate the thermodynamic potential , single - particle green s function , and two - particle green s function of superconductivity self - consistently based on a single functional @xmath0 $ ] , whose expression may be obtained by a concise perturbation expansion in terms of @xmath8 .",
    "we carry it out in the coordinate representation so that general inhomogeneous systems may be handled . in  3 , we focus on homogeneous systems and transform the results of  2 into the momentum-``energy '' representation .",
    "closed equations in the flex - s approximation are also derived .",
    "section 4 presents a brief summary to indicate main results .",
