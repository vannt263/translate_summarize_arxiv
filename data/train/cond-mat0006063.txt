    "the steady flow in a long channel or in a long tube of circular section under the action of a difference between the pressures imposed at the two ends , usually known as poiseuille flow or hagen - poiseuille flow , is a typical textbook example in fluid dynamics @xcite . in the last few years",
    ", a number of authors @xcite have analyzed this problem with the channel geometry when the pressure difference is replaced by a constant external field @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite have analyzed the solution of the boltzmann equation in the navier - stokes limit .",
    "a generalized navier - stokes theory was seen to give a reasonable account of a fluid composed of molecules that possess spin when compared with molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "other studies @xcite , on the other hand , have focused on the breakdown of the continuum hydrodynamic predictions when the strength of the external field is not asymptotically small . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an exact solution of the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) model kinetic equation was found for a particular value of the field strength .",
    "the general solution under the form of an expansion in powers of @xmath0 was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where explicit expressions were derived to fifth order in the field .",
    "more recently , the general solution corresponding to the boltzmann equation for maxwell molecules has been derived to second order @xcite and approximate solutions for hard spheres have been obtained from a burnett description @xcite and by means of moment methods @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite have been confirmed at a qualitative and semi - quantitative level by numerical simulations of the boltzmann equation @xcite and by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the most surprising of those theoretical predictions is that the temperature profile exhibits a bimodal shape , namely a local minimum at the middle of the channel surrounded by two symmetric maxima at a distance of a few mean free paths .",
    "in contrast , the continuum hydrodynamic equations predict a temperature profile with a ( flat ) maximum at the middle . as a consequence ,",
    "the fourier law is dramatically violated since in the slab enclosed by the two maxima the tranverse component of the heat flux is parallel ( rather than anti - parallel ) to the thermal gradient .",
    "furthermore , non - newtonian properties , such as normal stress differences and an effective shear viscosity depending on the hydrodynamic gradients , are also present .",
    "the goal of this paper is to carry out a kinetic theory description of the poiseuille flow driven by an external force when the gas is inside a pipe .",
    "the reason is two - fold .",
    "first , the pipe geometry is much more realistic , and thus more worth studying , than the channel one .",
    "second , it is important to test whether the failure of the continuum description to account for some of the qualitative features of the poiseuille flow in a channel is not linked to that particular geometry and extends to the pipe case as well . in this context , it is worthwhile noting that an exact solution of the boltzmann equation ( with maxwell molecules ) for the _ planar _ fourier flow , which is valid for arbitrary values of the thermal gradient @xcite , does _ not _ extend to the _ cylindrical _ geometry @xcite .",
    "the results reported in this paper , on the other hand , confirm that the structure of the hydrodynamic and flux profiles in the pipe problem is quite similar to that of the channel problem .",
    "in particular , the temperature exhibits a non - monotonic behavior as one moves apart from the pipe axis .",
    "nevertheless , the deviations from the continuum description are in general quantitatively smaller than in the channel case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the continuum hydrodynamic description is worked out in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , both for the channel and cylindrical geometries .",
    "when the navier - stokes constitutive equations are inserted into the exact balance equations for mass , momentum and energy , a closed set of coupled equations for the hydrodynamic fields ( pressure , flow velocity and temperature ) is obtained .",
    "the spatial dependence of the transport coefficients through the temperature is taken into account .",
    "given the nonlinear character of the set of equations , its solution is expressed in powers of the external force .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to a summary of the results obtained from the kinetic theory description in the case of the channel poiseuille flow and a critical comparison with the navier - stokes predictions is carried out .",
    "the original part of the paper is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , where the bgk kinetic equation is solved for the pipe poiseuille problem by means of a perturbation expansion in powers of the force .",
    "explicit expressions for the successive contributions to the velocity distribution function through fourth order in the force are derived . by velocity integration , the profiles of the hydrodynamic fields and their fluxes",
    "are then obtained . since the content of sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is rather technical , the discussion of the results is postponed to sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , where only terms through third order are considered . as in the planar case , the kinetic theory results strongly differ from the continuum theory expectations , especially in the case of the temperature profile .",
    "the breakdown of the fourier law is characterized by an apparent thermal conductivity coefficient that only for large distances tends to the navier - stokes coefficient .",
    "analogously , an apparent shear viscosity coefficient is introduced to monitor deviations from the newton law .",
    "finally , the main conclusions of the paper are presented in sec .  [ sec6 ] .",
