    "recent progress in nanotechnology allows to fabricate transistors with a single molecule forming the active region.@xcite the transport properties of such devices have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "theoretical approaches have been reviewed by andergassen _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite and by zimbovskaya and pederson.@xcite    the transport properties of single - molecule devices are often dominated by strong interactions .",
    "electron - electron interaction , which leads to the coulomb blockade,@xcite and the coupling of electrons to vibrational modes@xcite have to be taken into account .",
    "we assume the nuclear motion to be slow on the time scale of electronic transitions , which is the case for most , but not for all , single - molecule devices studied so far.@xcite the electron - vibron coupling is then due to the change of the equilibrium nuclear configuration with the electronic state , i.e. , the franck - condon effect : even if a molecule is initially in a vibrational eigenstate , after an electronic transition it will be in a superposition of vibrational eigenstates belonging to the new electronic configuration .",
    "the probability to end up in any one of them is determined by franck - condon matrix elements between vibrational eigenstates for the old and new electronic configurations.@xcite these matrix elements can be very small if the equilibrium value of the relevant normal coordinate changes strongly with the electronic state .",
    "consequently , the rates for electrons tunneling into or out of the molecule and thus the current can be strongly suppressed ",
    "this is the franck - condon blockade.@xcite the dynamics is also unusual in this regime : electrons tunnel in avalanches separated by quiet time intervals.@xcite the avalanche - type transport is self - similar on intermediate timescales and also leads to a strong enhancement of the zero - frequency fano factor.@xcite    strong interactions and states far from equilibrium make the description of molecular devices difficult in general.@xcite we here focus on the case of weak hybridization between the molecule and the leads . in this case ,",
    "master - equation ( me ) approaches@xcite or the equivalent real - time diagrammatic approach@xcite can be employed . in principle , the me takes into account all interactions in the molecule but requires an approximate treatment of the coupling to the leads .",
    "the simplest non - trivial version of the me treats the hybridization to second order ( sequential tunneling ) and neglects off - diagonal components of the reduced density matrix in the eigenbasis of the molecular hamiltonian.@xcite the neglect of the off - diagonal components is generally not justified if some of the eigenstates are degenerate , since then the choice of eigenstates in the degenerate subspaces is arbitrary . in the absence of spin - dependent terms in the hamiltonian ,",
    "spin degeneracy is always present .",
    "it is then appropriate to retain all _ secular _ components of the reduced density operator,@xcite i.e. , all diagonal matrix elements and off - diagonal matrix elements between degenerate states .",
    "going beyond sequential tunneling , at fourth order one obtains cotunneling and pair tunneling as well as a contribution to the life - time broadening of the molecular levels.@xcite koch _ _ et al.__@xcite include cotunneling but consider only the diagonal components of the reduced density matrix .",
    "however , integrating out the off - diagonal terms of second order generates contributions of fourth order to the transition rates between the diagonal components , which are taken into account by leijnse and wegewijs@xcite as well as koller _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite    the dynamics of charge transport through molecules , in particular in the franck - condon regime , have so far mostly been studied by considering the current - noise spectrum and the full counting statistics.@xcite for the franck - condon regime , these studies have been augmented by real - time monte carlo simulations.@xcite recently , donarini _ _ et al.__@xcite have considered a harmonically varying bias voltage .",
    "assuming spinless electrons and employing the markov and sequential - tunneling approximations , they find hysteretic behavior of current and charge.@xcite in the present paper , we propose and illustrate a different approach to the dynamics : we study the eigenvalue spectrum of the transition - rate matrix appearing in the me .",
    "since these eigenvalues describe the decay rates and oscillation frequencies of _ deviations _ of the reduced density matrix from the stationary solution , they provide a complementary view of the dynamics .",
    "more specifically , we will consider the part of the spectrum that is small in absolute value , corresponding to states that decay or oscillate slowly .",

    "in the following we consider a device containing a single molecule coupled to two electrodes .",

    ", we assume that both electrodes have identical band structures and a constant density of states . the operator @xmath2 creates an electron in lead @xmath3 with momentum @xmath4 and spin @xmath5 .",

    "the reduced density operator of the molecule is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the full density operator of the molecule and the leads and the trace is over all many - particle states of the leads .",

    "the right - hand side of the me is linear in @xmath21 so that we can rewrite it as a product involving a superoperator @xmath22 .",
    "we write @xmath21 in the basis of eigenstates @xmath23 to the eigenvalues @xmath24 of @xmath25 , where @xmath26 specifies the electronic state and @xmath27 is the quantum number of the vibration .",

    "then , @xmath37 is the negative of the decay rate of the corresponding solution , while @xmath38 is the angular frequency of its oscillations .",
    "evidently , a vanishing eigenvalue @xmath39 corresponds to a stationary state .",
    "the stationary density operator is thus the right eigenvector @xmath40 if we impose the normalization condition @xmath41 .",

    "this solution is unique if the system is ergodic in the sense that every state can be reached from every other state by a finite number of transitions.@xcite this condition is satisfied by our model for non - zero temperature . thus there is exactly one eigenvalue @xmath39 .    what is the meaning of the other right eigenvectors @xmath35 for @xmath45 ?",
    "these eigenvectors are not well - formed density matrices since they have zero trace .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath43 is a left eigenvector to eigenvalue zero . since the left and right eigenvectors to different eigenvalues",
