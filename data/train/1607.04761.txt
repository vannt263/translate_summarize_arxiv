    "the idea of control is associated with the concept of implementing actions to ensure that a system behaves as desired .",
    "nature is prodigal in presenting sophisticated mechanisms that regulate phenomena which take place in all scales of time and space @xcite .",
    "these control strategies reach the ultimate level of efficiency and refinement in biological systems which are responsible for the emergence of the sustainable phenomenon of life .",
    "a careful and systematic investigation performed on mechanisms nature uses for system control reveals that sometimes it is not necessary to stress the system and drive it directly to the desired operation point @xcite .",
    "in contrast , it is more reliable to control the setup by letting it to fluctuate and change its dynamics as little as possible to drive it to the desired state without applying intense external forces .",
    "a prominent example of such behaviour is a brownian motor @xcite .",
    "it is an archetypal scheme in which , even in the absence of externally applied bias , directed motion may emerge by harvesting environmental noise via the mechanism of breaking of spatiotemporal symmetries of the setup @xcite .",
    "this working principle can be seen as a key for understanding various processes occurring in numerous disciplines of science , including e.g. intracellular transport @xcite . in view of the widespread applications of brownian motors ,",
    "directed motion controllability has become a focal point of research in nonequilibrium statistical physics which inspired a plethora of new microscale devices displaying unusual transport features @xcite .",
    "bearing in mind the latter , irregularity of behaviour generally means its unpredictability , which , when it comes to applications , one is usually keen to avoid or at least minimize .",
    "however , as regards the biological systems , too much regularity might be considered as a sign of certain disfunction . for instance",
    ", the normal hearth rhythm of a healthy human at rest is not periodic , but it is moderately erratic , while the perfect periodicity may be life threatening @xcite .",
    "hence , depending on the circumstances one needs to make the motion in the system more disordered or suppress the unwanted fluctuations .",
    "since eintein s and smoluchowski s revolutionary papers @xcite scientists across all disciplines use the theory of brownian motion to quantify this irregularity and provide the link between an elementary underlying microscopic dynamics and macroscopic observable phenomena , such as the ubiquitous fluctuations in systems of natural as well as social sciences . without any doubt , the problem of diffusion has played a central role in the development of both the foundations of thermodynamics and the dynamical interpretation of statistical physics @xcite",
    ".    being inspired by physics of brownian motors , in this paper we ask to what extent it is possible to control diffusive behaviour of the system by harvesting environmental thermal fluctuations themselves . even einstein in his seminal paper @xcite posed this question to formulate his famous linear relation between the particle diffusion constant @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 of the system , @xmath2 @xcite . here , we demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient can be _ nonmonotonic _ function of temperature .",
    "it means that the noise assisted motion can be quite irregular at small thermal fluctuations , but , counterintuitively , its regularity may grow with the increase of thermal noise intensity , reaching the maximum for some moderate fluctuations .",

    "long time prediction of a chaotic motion is impossible .",
    "however , this characteristic also implies that a chaotic system is extremely sensitive to the effect of perturbation .",
    "moreover , another key characteristic of such a system is that there are an infinite variety of behaviours embedded in it @xcite .",

    "we note that there are many cycles @xmath62 for which the velocity @xmath90 is intermediate between the three states @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath87 .",

    "we conclude that when the absolute difference @xmath100 increases then the diffusion coefficient @xmath0 grows as well .",
    "it is especially evident when simultaneously @xmath98 enlarges . in the high thermal noise limit ,",
    "fluctuations are so large that the effective periodic potential becomes negligible",
    ". then the system behaves as a free particle in a viscous fluid with the increasing diffusion coefficient when temperature grows .",
    "we reveal the surprising phenomenon that chaotic motion can be stabilized by thermal fluctuations in the sense that they may modify the probability for the brownian particle to be in one of the orbits embedded into the chaotic set @xcite . in principle",
    ", this mechanism constitutes a paradigm of _ chaos control _ @xcite .",
    "the accessibility of the chaotic setup to many different periodic orbits combined with its sensitivity to small perturbations allows for manipulation of the system in order to realize a desirable behaviour .",
    "in this work we have studied diffusion in periodic systems .",
    "we formulated this problem in terms of a commonly used description of a driven inertial brownian particle moving in a symmetric spatially periodic potential which is also popular as an archetype model of a chaotic system .",
    "the motion of a typical brownian particle trajectory in the presented postcritical regime exhibits the intermittent behaviour consisting of the irregular jumps between the three most populated states corresponding to the running @xmath88 , @xmath87 as well as the locked @xmath89 solution .",
    "we demonstrated how _ randomness _ in the form of thermal equilibrium fluctuations can be _ harvested _ to _ control chaotic motion _ of the system .",
    "in particular , temperature change can stabilize one of the infinite number of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic attractor .",
    "in other words it means that the probability for the particle to be in the running states @xmath95 can be controlled by temperature of the system .",
    "this in turn implies that the diffusion coefficient exhibits _ nonmonotonic _ dependence on thermal noise intensity leading to the phenomenon of _ temperature suppressed diffusion _ @xcite which is also related to the _ coherence resonance _ observed in excitable systems @xcite .",
    "similar result has already been observed in diffusive motion of an overdamped brownian particle in a tilted periodic @xcite and disordered @xcite potentials or for an adiabatically driven inertial brownian particle moving in a periodic one - dimensional geometry @xcite .",
    "however , there the diffusion coefficient attains its local minimum as a function of thermal noise intensity due to sufficiently strong but subcritical external bias that introduces an appropriate deformation of the periodic potential .",
    "contrasting to this static effect , here comparable behaviour is induced by the purely dynamical phenomenon which is associated with the complex chaotic evolution of the system .",
    "since the latter is widespread in nature we expect that the similar diffusion anomaly may be observed in various contexts appearing in the most diverse areas of science such as physics , chemistry , biology , engineering , computer science or even sociology .",
    "since recently the phenomenon of temperature suppressed diffusion has been detected as well in a non - chaotic rocking ratchet device @xcite , it seems that the theory standing behind this peculiar behaviour presented in this work may not be the only valid one .",

    "such a laser configuration generates a moving optical potential .",
    "however , in this accelerated frame the potential is stationary and the atoms experience also an inertial force which is proportional to the time - dependent phase modulation @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "last but not least , we stress that the detected anomaly of diffusive behaviour manifesting in temperature suppressed diffusion can be observed in _ deep _ optical lattices . this should be clearly contrasted with an already quite well explored regime of _ shallow _ potentials where typical anomalous diffusion processes occur @xcite .",

    "it is even more surprising that this control is implemented by thermal fluctuations which are usually considered as a source of irregularity in the motion of any real system .",
    "it turned out that thermal noise assisted motion can be quite erratic at small fluctuations , but , counterintuitively , its regularity may grow with the increase of thermal noise intensity , reaching the maximum for some moderate fluctuations .",

    "<S> diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and a key idea in almost all branches of science that quantifies irregularity of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can arise from two main sources . </S>",
    "<S> first , the dynamics of the system can be deterministically chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> second , irregularity in the motion occurs due to the unavoidable presence of random fluctuations or noise in any real setup . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the motion becomes even more irregular if without random fluctuations the deterministic system is chaotic . here </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a nonequilibrium system consisting of a driven brownian particle diffusing in a periodic potential . </S>",
    "<S> typically diffusion is normal in the asymptotic long time regime and the corresponding diffusion coefficient @xmath0 increases with temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are regimes in which initially @xmath0 increases as @xmath1 grows , passes through its local maximum , next starts to decrease reaching its local minimum for some temperature and finally it again increases with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal the mechanism responsible for such _ temperature suppressed diffusion _ and demonstrate how thermal fluctuations can be _ harvested _ to _ control chaotic motion _ of the particle leading to _ nonmonotonic _ dependence of the diffusion coefficient on temperature . since chaos exists in many natural as well as artificial systems representing almost all areas of contemporary knowledge , the described mechanism could be potentially discovered in a wealth of various contexts . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we propose an experiment using cold atoms in _ deep _ optical lattices where this _ other _ form of anomalous diffusion could be observed . </S>"
