    "the study of the distribution of embedded stars in giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) is important for our understanding of the problem of star formation . at the embedded stage ,",
    "these young stars represent the most recent episodes of star forming activity and therefore their physical properties should reflect the initial conditions of their parental cores .",
    "near - infrared observations of the distribution of embedded stars in nearby clouds reveal that the majority of stars form in embedded clusters @xcite with _ rich _ clusters ( @xmath0 members ) clearly dominating over small groups as they contain more than 80% of the embedded stellar population in gmcs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ll03 ) .",
    "however , such surveys have been mostly restricted to nearby clouds ( @xmath1 pc ) , mainly because the study of more distant complexes is limited by photometric depth and resolution of the existing observations .",
    "data from available surveys like 2mass are not sensitive to faint sources ( @xmath2 ) , limiting our ability to sample the young , low mass population in distant molecular clouds .",
    "this makes it difficult to make meaningful comparisons between properties of star forming regions in different parts of the galaxy .    as part of the noao survey program _ toward a complete near - infrared spectroscopic and imaging survey of giant molecular clouds _",
    "( p.i . : elizabeth a. lada ) , we chose the rosette complex in the constellation of monoceros for a new systematic near - infrared study of a molecular cloud outside of the local neighborhood .",
    "a complete review of past and current studies on the rosette complex can be found in @xcite .",
    "the rosette , located in the constellation of monoceros at a distance of @xmath3 kpc @xcite , stands out as a very important astrophysical laboratory for the study of the early evolution of stars , because of its exquisite layout : at the center of its best known feature , the rosette nebula , there is a giant ob association , ngc  2244 , whose powerful uv radiation has generated an expanding hii region .",
    "it has been suggested that the shock front generated by the photo - dissociation bubble could have triggered the formation of a family of young clusters ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter pl97 ) located in the adjacent , highly structured rosette molecular cloud ( rmc ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter wbs95 ) , following a process known as sequential star formation ( ssf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "it is crucial to investigate the influence of the local environment ( particularly the expanding hii region ) on the properties of the young clusters , as it would help us to understand the different initial conditions under which cluster formation occurs .",
    "the rosette has been previously surveyed in the near infrared .",
    "pl97 obtained @xmath4,@xmath5 and @xmath6 photometry with the simultaneous quad infrared imaging device ( sqiid ) at the kpno-2.1 m telescope , and were able to identify seven embedded clusters by visual inspection of their images . in figure",
    "[ fig : zones ] we show the location of the pl97 clusters in the rmc , in the context of the main regions of the cloud identified by @xcite : the regions a1 - 1 and a1 - 2 , also known as the `` ridge '' and the `` central core '' of the cloud , host 4 of the pl97 clusters : pl02 , pl04 , pl05 and pl06 .",
    "the cluster pl07 is located in region b or `` back core '' of the cloud .",
    "finally two more clusters , pl01 and pl03 are located in two cores apparently separated from the main cloud , labeled as c and d. all of the clusters discovered by pl97 were associated with a luminous iras source and a massive molecular clump from the study of wbs95 , and until now , no other study has been able to determine the existence of additional clusters .",
    "recently , a spatially uniform catalog from the 2mass survey was used by @xcite to study the distribution of star forming activity in the rosette molecular cloud .",
    "they suggested the existence of three general areas of cluster formation , coincident with the areas with highest extinction and temperature of the cloud .",
    "the extensions of the star formation regions of @xcite were determined by eye , roughly tracing the division of bt80 and enclosing the main clumps of wbs95 and the locations of the pl97 clusters .",
    "these general star forming regions could not be compared with the clusters of pl97 because the extensions and membership of individual clusters were not determined in the later study .",
    "also , due to the low sensitivity limits of 2mass and sqiid ( @xmath7 mag ) , neither the study of pl97 nor that of @xcite could adequately sample the low mass population at the distance of the rosette complex and therefore could not determine the fraction of stars forming in clusters .",
    "furthermore , the rosette complex is located at a low galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) , and the level of field star contamination in the direction of the cloud is very high , making the identification of cloud members even more difficult , specially for low sensitivity data .    in our study",
    "we try to overcome these problems by a ) using deeper observations of the region , capable of detecting sources below the limits previously set by 2mass and b ) by using a selected sample of sources with near - infrared excess ( nirx ) to trace young populations with a minimum of non - member contamination ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and c ) by using the method of nearest neighbors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ch85 ) to detect surface densities intrinsically larger than the highly crowded field , thus allowing us to detect clusters of embedded stars .",
    "the main goals of our survey are to investigate the distribution of star formation in the rosette , determine the fraction of stars that form in embedded clusters and compare these results to those found in other local clouds such as orion .",
    "we also determine the distribution of the physical properties ( i.p .",
    "size and near - infrared excess fraction ) of the identified clusters in order to study the star forming history and evolution of the clusters .",
    "finally , we aim to investigate the distribution of embedded sources across the cloud to investigate the influence of the hii region on its star forming properties , and also to test the hypothesis of sequential formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ section : observations ] we describe our observations and the quality of our dataset ; in section [ section : analysis ] we explain the methods used to determine the distribution of young stars in the rosette complex , specifically the selection of near - infrared excess sources and the use of the nearest neighbor method ; in section [ section : results ] , we present the results from our analysis , namely the identification and properties of the embedded clusters ; and in section [ section : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our results in the the context of the global properties of the rosette complex along with a summary of our work .",
    "the data were obtained with the florida multi object imaging near - infrared grism observational spectrometer flamingos at the kpno 2.1 m telescope . this project is part of the noao survey program _ toward a complete near - infrared spectroscopic and imaging survey of giant molecular clouds_. at the 2.1 m telescope , flamingos has a fov of @xmath9 , and in the case of the rosette complex ,",
    "a total of 23 flamingos fields were observed during winters of 2001 to 2004 using the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters ( 1.25 , 1.65 and 2.2 @xmath10 m , respectively . )",
    "the rosette observations were designed to survey the regions of significant molecular gas density revealed by the @xmath11co and @xmath12co maps of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also wbs95 ) ( integrated intensity levels above 20  k@xmath13km@xmath13s@xmath14and 0.8  k@xmath13km@xmath13s@xmath14 , respectively ) as well as the 25 @xmath10 m emission map from the iras survey ( we considered as significant those areas with emission above 5.0 mjy@xmath13sr@xmath14 ) . the result is a very complete coverage of the rosette nebula and the rosette molecular cloud regions . a map showing the positions of the observed fields can be seen in figure [ fig : surveymap ] .",
    "twenty of the fields are adjacent , while 3 of them ( areas 4 , g1 and g2 ) were added to enhance the quality of the observations in some particularly interesting regions .",
    "in addition , to account for the field contamination , we observed 2 near control fields located away from the main molecular cloud emission .",
    "these control fields have the same depth as any of our on - source fields , and their locations are also indicated in figure [ fig : surveymap ] .",
    "all the data of the flamingos star formation survey were processed with the aid of pipelines built in the standard iraf command language .",
    "one pipeline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) processes raw data by applying a linearization correction , subtracting dark current , dividing by dome flat fields , applying a two pass sky subtraction method , and combining reduced frames into image products which are free of geometric distortions , re - sampled to twice their size and trimmed into final frames of 4096@xmath154096 pixels .",
    "these products were then analyzed with a second pipeline ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which extracts all possible sources from a given field , applies psf photometry , and calculates an accurate astrometric solution and creates final catalogs after matching lists from individual filter observations .",
    "both photometry and astrometry are calibrated with respect to 2mass .    for the rosette survey ,",
    "the completeness limits are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 mag , and are slightly fainter in a few fields observed under optimal weather conditions .",
    "the completeness limits were determined with artificial star experiments , and apply well within 75 to 80% of the area covered in each field , but are up to 0.25 mag brighter near the edges of the fields , where the photometric sensitivity of the flamingos detector degraded from the center due to a loss in optical quality @xcite .",
    "this optical degradation also affected the shapes of the star images near the edges , and we required to apply a correction to the zero point of the photometric calibration .",
    "the correction is radial , with center on the point of best psf adjustment ( which varied , depending on field and epoch within a radius of approximately 100 pixels from position [ 3000,2400 ] in the 4096@xmath154096 final image grid ) , and for the rosette survey fields it was well defined with a sixth order polynomial form . those stars located at radii where the correction was larger than 0.1 mag were not included in the final catalogs .",
    "in figure [ fig : badareas ] we show a map of the individual fields and the extension of the bad quality areas , which in all cases were smaller than 12% .",
    "the zero point correction , however , helped to reduce photometric scatter in the accepted areas by an average of 0.02 mag in each field .",
    "our final mean photometric uncertainties are @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : globalerrs ] shows the mean photometric uncertainties and their standard deviations per magnitude bin as a function of brightness in each band . in this analysis we only used catalog stars with photometric uncertainties deviating no more than 3.0@xmath22 from the mean .",
    "completeness limits for the analysis were not significantly compromised with these cuts , because most of the sources rejected for having large photometric uncertainties were fainter than @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 mag .",
    "additionally , for those sources in which all 3 bands were required for the analysis , we placed a new limit to the total color uncertainties , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , requiring them to be smaller than 0.1 mag .",
    "this last constraint restricted the photometric errors in each band to be no larger than 0.071 mag .",
    "sources brighter than approximately 11.0 mag suffered of saturation . to account for this , we rejected all sources above @xmath27 from our catalogs ( this cut also removed saturated stars in bands @xmath4 and @xmath6 , which had slightly brighter saturation limits ) , and replaced them with the corresponding 2mass point sources obtained from the all sky release database .",
    "the total number of sources replaced was 798 . after applying the photometric quality cuts to the entire database we retained 74,285 sources for analysis .",
    "the rosette complex is located at 1.6 kpc from the sun , more than four times further away than regions such as orion and perseus , where systematic searches for embedded clusters have been previously performed .",
    "furthermore , the rosette is located at a very low galactic latitude ( @xmath28 ) and towards the anti - center of the galaxy ( @xmath29 ) , which results in a very high density of field sources located in the foreground and background of the cloud .",
    "these characteristics make it more difficult to detect clusters using traditional star count methods .",
    "for that reason , our analysis focuses on optimizing the detection of young , embedded sources in the cloud .",
    "this is done by a ) selecting them from a sample of infrared excess stars ( nirx ) and b ) by analyzing their distribution of surface densities using a method of nearest neighbors .      in the @xmath30 vs.  @xmath31 color - color diagram",
    ", nirx stars fall to the right of the band defined by the projection of the giant and dwarf sequences along the direction of interstellar reddening .",
    "this vector of extinction is defined by a standard reddening law ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if de - reddened , low mass nirx stars would fall back to the classic t tauri star ( ctts ) locus @xcite , which is defined by large @xmath31 colors indicative of dramatic intrinsic extinction due to the presence of circumstellar material .",
    "the fraction of stars falling into this nirx region has been observed to be fairly large in deeply embedded clusters ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "studies have shown that the total nirx fraction in young clusters decreases with age , as a result of inner disk evolution @xcite .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 fraction in the trapezium and ngc 2024 ( ages @xmath331 myr ) is close to 50% , while in slightly older clusters like ic 348 ( age @xmath332 myr ) the @xmath32 fraction is around 20% .",
    "the deeply embedded population of the rmc can be expected to be younger than the exposed ob association ngc  2244 , which is estimated to have an age of 2 myr from spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath32 excess fraction in the embedded clusters of the rosette can be expected to be between 20 and 50% , significant enough to trace well the most recent episode of formation .    for our study , we define an nirx star as one with colors that place it 0.1 mag ( 5 times the standard deviation of the @xmath31 uncertainty ) to the right of the dwarf zero age main sequence reddening band ( zamsrb ) , and above @xmath34 , which defines the lower limit for the classic t tauri star ( ctts ) locus given the listed uncertainties of @xcite .",
    "the first of these two constraints avoids contamination of the sample from non - nirx stars with large @xmath31 uncertainties that could place the stars slightly outside the right edge of the zamsrb .",
    "the second one impedes the inclusion of objects that lie in the region located below the ctts line .",
    "this region , just as the one to the left of the zamsrb , contains detections that are mainly due to high color scatter .",
    "also , in some cases unresolved galaxies ( which can pass as stars ) with large photometric spreads @xcite or highly inclined intrinsic reddening vectors due to dominant emission from hii regions and ao stars @xcite are located in this region of the diagram .    combined effects of variable seeing quality over the seasons and variability of the focus quality across the wide detector field of flamingos , resulted in a high dispersion of color values at the faint end of our sample , and it can not be reduced with the zero point corrections nor the uncertainty restrictions .",
    "the scatter in the @xmath31 colors increases for sources fainter than @xmath35 mag . at this limit ,",
    "the field object density also increases significantly , and the larger the uncertainty in @xmath31 , the more difficult it is to distinguish cloud members from background sources . in figure",
    "[ fig : cccs ] we show the color - color diagrams for stars with @xmath36  mag and for stars with @xmath37  mag respectively . in these diagrams ,",
    "the lowest contour level shown represents the mean surface density of objects in the color - color space , and each subsequent level represents a step of 1 standard deviation .",
    "the diagrams show how the scatter for the bright end of the sample is much smaller than for the faint end , where we can see a quasi symmetric increase in the dispersion of colors at both sides of the zamsrb near the most populated areas of the diagram .",
    "our calculations indicate that the mean standard deviation of the @xmath31 color dispersion is twice as large for the faint end bins ( 0.11 vs. 0.21 mag , calculated for the entire catalog ) .",
    "the effect is also slightly worse for those fields in the survey which were observed under the less favorable weather and airmass conditions .",
    "large scatter in photometric colors directly affects the calculation of the number of nirx stars in our survey .",
    "we performed a series of monte carlo experiments in which we simulated the colors of stars drawn from a model population with an age of 1 myr @xcite located at the distance of the rosette .",
    "we then added color errors and extinction to these sources , similar to those observed in the survey fields .",
    "we found that the number of stars with colors similar to those of nirx stars due to photometric scatter can be up to 5 times larger for stars fainter than @xmath35 .    because we are basing our analysis on the detection of infrared excess sources",
    ", we limited the primary aspect of our analysis , the identification of embedded clusters , to those stars in the bright end of the sample ( @xmath38 mag ) .",
    "this sample restriction is rather conservative , but assures a more robust detection across the entire survey area .",
    "it is important to remark that these bright nirx sources are only helping us to _ trace _ the location and rough extension of clusters , and although our color uncertainties are high , individual k band magnitudes are still good within 0.05 mag ( averaged ) , and thus the sample is still robust enough to construct accurate luminosity distributions with a bin resolution of 0.25 mag .",
    "also , the photometric depth limit of @xmath35 implies a sample 1.5 magnitudes deeper than 2mass and is equivalent ( for dwarf type stars ) to a stellar mass range of 0.09 to 0.18  @xmath39    for a population of 1 myr embedded in a cloud with a typical extinction of 0 to 10 visual magnitudes @xcite      in order to optimize cluster identification , we used a variation of the nearest neighbors method ( * ? ? ? * hereafter nnm ) to determine which objects in our fields have surface densities above the crowded background levels .",
    "the nnm has been shown to have success in detecting and outlining the extensions of embedded clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fl07 ) .",
    "the generalized form of the @xmath40th nearest neighbor surface density estimator for a star in a field is simply :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the distance from any given star to its @xmath40th neighbor .",
    "this estimator has only one degree of freedom , the fixed number of neighbors , @xmath40 , used to calculate the local density . for a large enough value of @xmath40",
    ", the fluctuations in the local density estimations due to local irregularities will be small , which assures an accurate determination of the extension and structure of large systems .",
    "however , for the same reason , @xmath40 also limits the minimum number of grouped stars that can be detected without confusion : if @xmath40 is much larger than the minimum number of stars that define a group or cluster , then small structures could be overlooked , as their surface densities will be systematically lower than a defined average value .",
    "ch85 showed that @xmath43 is the minimum number that can assure unbiased detection of groups with up to 1000 stars , but is 15% more susceptible to local statistical fluctuations than larger values of @xmath40 .",
    "the selection of @xmath40 for each application will simply depend on the goal : for example , in their study of young clusters using 2mass data , fl07 chose a @xmath44 estimator , which allowed them to identify clusters with radii as small as 0.3 pc and a minimum of 20@xmath455 members .",
    "@xcite used @xmath46 to determine the membership in cluster fields at high resolution in combination with carefully corrected source counts .    at first",
    ", we tried to emulate fl07 by applying a @xmath44 estimator to our final rmc catalog and our control fields , expecting to be able to detect and delimit the already known structures : ngc  2244 and the seven embedded clusters reported by pl97 .",
    "the result was that ngc  2244 could be easily identified as a high density region , along with the clusters pl04 and pl05 , located in the core of the cloud .",
    "the three mid size clusters pl01 , pl03 , and pl07 could be identified too , but their apparent structures were not much more significant than some density fluctuations in our fields due to patchy extinction . finally , stars in the smaller clusters pl02 and pl06 had 20th nn densities below the 3@xmath22 level , and thus these clusters could not stand out above the noise levels of the distribution .",
    "cluster pl06 , which is associated with the b - type proto binary afgl961 , contains large quantities of obscuring material near its center , complicating the detection of its faintest and most embedded members even in carefully constructed near - infrared maps ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "cluster pl02 is deeply embedded near the front part of the cloud , where material appears to be in contact with the expanding hii region .",
    "likely , for small embedded clusters like pl02 and pl06 , the combination of small number of members , high background contamination and non - uniform extinction , hampers the effectiveness of the nnm .",
    "furthermore , in regions of high extinction , some embedded clusters could have surface densities intrinsically lower than the field so that their members could be undetectable with a large @xmath40 . or",
    ", random patches of low extinction in the cloud could have larger than average field densities and may pass as `` false '' clusters .    in order to overcome these complications , we applied the nnm only to a jhk color selected sample of sources that exhibited a near infrared excess .",
    "this allowed us to trace preferentially the youngest and most probable members of the cloud .",
    "for this reason , the number of nirx sources is expected to greatly diminish outside the molecular cloud , and therefore background contamination is reduced , along with false cluster occurrences .",
    "also , the number of young sources with nirx is expected to be larger in deeply embedded populations , and consequently high extinction regions could actually present larger nirx densities , opposite from the `` all - star count '' case , in which these regions would be overlooked .    since it is expected that only a fraction of the members in a given young cluster exhibit infrared excess , then our sample will diminish in size , and our @xmath40 estimator value has to be reduced accordingly .",
    "we experimented with different values of @xmath40 , from 6 to 15 , and we ultimately adopted a value of @xmath47 for our analysis .",
    "this choice allows us to detect nirx groups of 10 members , which for a typical nirx fraction of 30 percent ( see section [ section : analysis : subsection : nirx ] ) would trace a cluster with @xmath33 30 members .",
    "a preliminary visual inspection of the images of the less populated clusters , pl01 , pl02 and pl06 , indicated that the typical number of stars within visible areas of bright nebulosity usually coincident with embedded cluster cores could be indeed , around 30 .",
    "this is close to the minimum number that defines a cluster dynamically @xcite , and below that , any groups could at most be considered associations or isolated populations , although they will be harder to distinguish from local fluctuations . in principle",
    ", a lower value of @xmath40 would allow us to detect those smaller stellar groups , but our tests indicate that analysis with lower values ( i.e. @xmath40=6 to 10 ) do not differ significantly from the case of @xmath47 , and thus we opted for this , more robust choice .",
    "we detected a total of 1169@xmath4534 nirx sources with @xmath38 .",
    "in figure [ fig:10nn_nirx_1575 ] we show their distributions of 10th nearest neighbor distances , @xmath48 and local surface densities @xmath49 .",
    "the mean value of @xmath48 is 3.79 arcmin ( 1.83  pc ) which corresponds to a @xmath50 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51  ( 0.92 stars@xmath13pc@xmath51 ) .",
    "this limit is also indicated in the plot .    for the control fields we found 19 sources that had nirx colors down to a maximum brightness of @xmath35 .",
    "the mean 10th nearest neighbor surface density of the 19 sources together is 0.18 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51  ( 0.82 stars@xmath13pc@xmath51 ) , which compares well with the mean value 0.2 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51   for the @xmath52 distribution in the cloud survey areas .",
    "thus , we considered a round value of 0.2 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51   as a _ background _",
    "level for the nirx population , below which we can not assure that an embedded nirx source has a density high enough to be distinguished from a field source with similar colors .",
    "the minimum value of the @xmath48 distribution in the survey is 0.311 arcmin , which represents a density of 29.5 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51  ( 136.3 stars@xmath13pc@xmath51 ) .",
    "this value is a good estimation of the typical local surface density in the central regions of rmc clusters .",
    "the midpoint between this minimum distance and the mean is 2.387 arcmin ( 1.1 pc ) which corresponds approximately to @xmath52=0.6 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51  ( 2.77 stars@xmath13pc@xmath51 ) .",
    "it turns out that this value is a good estimate of the average embedded cluster size in the rmc .",
    "in figure [ fig : nirxpos_1575 ] we show the location of nirx stars with surface densities higher than the background level at 0.2 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51 .",
    "all of the known clusters are traced well by these sources , which confirms that they are among the main regions of star formation in the rosette complex . in this plot",
    "we also show the contours of co from the study of @xcite . from now on we will use the nomenclature of the main rmc features from @xcite . as seen in the figure ,",
    "most nirx stars with high nn densities are located within the molecular cloud , except for those located in the field of the rosette nebula .    in figure",
    "[ fig : clusteriden ] we show a contour level map of the local surface densities calculated with the nn method ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the contours were constructed using a nyquist sampling box of 90@xmath53 . using this map ,",
    "we define an embedded cluster as a region for which we can observe a _ closed _ contour at a level of 0.2 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51 , containing at least 10 nirx sources . using this definition we found , in addition to ngc  2244 and the seven clusters from pl97 ,",
    "four additional areas that arise as significant but have not been previously studied :    the first new cluster , refl08 is located in the `` central core '' of the cloud , east of cluster pl05 and south of cluster pl04 . these two large , neighbor clusters present patchy reddening and have a number of members already visible in optical plates ( e.g. dss ) , thus they can be considered to be partially emerged from the cloud . in contrast ,",
    "refl08 , is not visible in any optical plates and has a large number of conspicuously reddened sources .",
    "therefore , refl08 appears to be a third , more deeply embedded substructure in this active region of star formation at the center of the cloud , in which clusters pl04 and pl05 are the largest clusters .    the second new cluster , refl09 is a relatively extended , highly reddened cluster located in the southeastern edge or `` back core '' of the cloud . along with refl08 ,",
    "these are clear examples of clusters which are located in regions of very high extinction , resulting in stellar surface densities comparable or lower than the field if a color selection is not applied .",
    "however , these clusters contain a large number of heavily reddened sources -easily distinguishable in jhk color composite images- and a significant number of nirx sources that let them stand unequivocally as embedded clusters .",
    "the third new cluster is located to the east of ngc  2244 , in the region of the cloud historically identified as ngc  2237 .",
    "the existence of this cluster was also suggested by @xcite in their study of 2mass data .",
    "the fourth cluster , refl10 , is much less prominent .",
    "it is located north of ngc  2244 , and despite of its low nirx surface density compared other star forming regions in the complex , its 13 nirx sources make it qualify as a cluster .",
    "refl10 is an example of cluster that would not be significant if the nn distribution of nirx sources was analyzed with a large value of @xmath40 , or if a color selection was not applied .",
    "once the clusters were identified , we proceeded to investigate their basic properties and how are they related in the context of the evolution of the star forming complex . for each cluster",
    "we determined sizes , centers , number of members and infrared excess fractions .",
    "these cluster properties were determined individually , isolating regions centered at each cluster density peak .",
    "the area of these individual cluster analysis regions varied from 25 to 120 arcmin@xmath54 , depending on the apparent extension of the cluster .",
    "this way we were able to observe in detail structures occupying areas between 6 and 60 arcmin@xmath54 .",
    "cluster boundaries are defined by the 0.2 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51  contour level in our nirx nn density plots .",
    "all sources with @xmath55  mag within this contour level are considered potential cluster members .",
    "cluster sizes are determined by measuring the area , @xmath56 , within the cluster boundary and calculating the equivalent radius , @xmath57 .",
    "the density peak , @xmath58 , and the core radius , @xmath59 , of each cluster were calculated with the formulation of ch85 .",
    "the density peak defines the natural center of a cluster , and is simply the density weighted average of the star positions in a given region :    @xmath60    similarly , the core radius , @xmath59 is defined as the density weighted average of the distance of each star to @xmath61 :    @xmath62    in table  [ tab : clustertable ] we present the center coordinates ( density peaks ) , core radii , equivalent radii , and average extinction values for each cluster .",
    "the latter were calculated from the @xmath31 colors .",
    "we also list the number of nirx sources to @xmath63  mag and the corresponding excess fraction .",
    "the excess fraction was calculated by comparing the number of ir excess sources to the number of cluster members .",
    "the number of cluster members was determined by subtracting the expected number of background field stars from the number of stars having @xmath64 within the cluster boundary .",
    "the number of field stars was determined for each cluster by scaling our off fields to the cluster areas and applying appropriate extinction corrections .    in figures [ fig : pl01panels ] to [ fig : ngc2244panels ] we show images of each of these cluster regions , as well as the color - magnitude diagrams , color - color diagrams and stellar radial profiles for all stars within the cluster boundaries .",
    "in the images , we marked nirx sources brighter or equal than @xmath35 mag with ` x ' symbols . in the @xmath6 vs. @xmath31 color - magnitude diagrams",
    "we plot , for each cluster , all of the stars inside the corresponding 0.2 stars@xmath13arcmin@xmath51  contour , and we marked with ` x ' symbols those objects with infrared excess .",
    "we also plot the zams locus and a pms evolution isochrone of 1 myr , both shifted to the distance of the rosette .",
    "the indicated extinction vectors corresponding to 3 times the mean value @xmath65 in the cluster analysis box .",
    "stars falling to the right of the 1 myr isochrone are clearly affected by extinction towards the line of sight of the cluster , revealing their highly embedded nature . in the @xmath30 vs. @xmath31 color - color diagrams ,",
    "the same stars are located above the dwarf and giant star sequences along the reddening bands , with the nirx sources located to the right of the zams reddening strip . those objects located at or near the zero age sequences are most probably foreground stars or evolved cloud members .",
    "the radial density profiles in the fourth panels of each cluster figure were constructed using annuli of decreasing width , each enclosing the same area ( see e.g. @xcite ) and centered on the weighted density peaks defined above . for these radial profiles we took into account all stars down to @xmath16 inside the analysis boxes . in the plots we indicate the equivalent and core radii defined above . clusters pl02 , pl06 and refl10 , have the lowest surface densities and their profiles are poorly defined , but the rest present well defined radial profiles , which show well extended tails . in four cases  clusters pl01 , pl04 , pl07 , refl09  the profiles show secondary peaks suggestive of structure . in the case of the nebula clusters ngc  2244 and ngc  2237 , their radial distribution profiles decline slowly , which suggest a diluted core peak and a rather extended structure .      under the assumption that the nirx sources trace",
    "well the extent of the clusters , the core and equivalent radii are good estimations of the total sizes of the clusters .",
    "the core radii , @xmath59 of the rosette clusters have a range of 0.69 to 4.17 arcmin ( 0.32 to 19.39 pc ) , with an average of 2.0@xmath451.0 arcmin ( 0.93@xmath450.47 pc ) .",
    "their equivalent radii , @xmath66 , vary from 1.6 to 4.9 arcmin ( 0.74 to 2.28 pc ) , with an average of 3.1@xmath451.0 arcmin ( 1.44@xmath450.47 pc ) . the distributions of these size estimates are shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : coreq ] .    in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : coreq ]",
    "we show the distribution of the ratio @xmath67 , which has a nominal peak at @xmath68 . in the study of fl07 , where nn analysis was applied to a large sample of known cluster fields",
    ", they found that embedded clusters separated in two groups by their value of @xmath69 : those with ratios below 0.5 are denominated as centrally condensed ( c - type clusters ) , while those with values closer to 1.0 are denominated as having a flat profile ( f - type clusters ) .",
    "we found that only two of the rmc clusters , pl01 and pl03 , have c - type ratios , and for three of the clusters , pl06 , refl10 and ngc  2237 , cores could not be easily determined and , for purposes of comparison , were given a ratio of @xmath70 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath69 ratios is rather different from the one observed by fl07 in their larger and more heterogeneous sample of clusters : they found a larger fraction of compact , embedded clusters ( 44 percent of the sample ) with well defined cores , while in our sample , centrally condensed clusters appear to be scarce .",
    "however , we note that the nn analysis of fl07 was not applied on color selected samples , but on all sources detected in a given field . from the observed distribution of cluster sizes and core - to - total size ratios it appears that the rosette clusters have preferentially extended profiles .    as listed in table  [ tab : clustertable ] , the observed nirx fractions of the nebula clusters , ngc  2244 and ngc  2237 are @xmath71 and @xmath72% , respectively , and therefore they are significantly smaller than those of the embedded clusters , which vary from @xmath73% in cluster pl05 to @xmath74% in cluster refl09 . also , the average nirx fraction in the molecular cloud areas is @xmath75% , i.e almost three times as large than in ngc  2244 and ngc  2237 .",
    "curiously , the fraction observed for refl10 , which is also located at the nebula is much closer to the average of the embedded clusters and actually slightly larger than those of clusters pl01 , pl04 and pl05 .    in figure [ fig : agerel ] we show the relation between the nirx fraction , the median extinction value and the equivalent radii of clusters . extinction and cluster size are negatively correlated with a pearson coefficient @xmath76 , while extinction and nirx fraction are positively correlated with a pearson coefficient @xmath77 . consequently ,",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : nirxfsizerel ] , cluster equivalent sizes and core sizes are both negatively correlated with nirxf , with pearson coefficients @xmath78 and @xmath79 respectively .",
    "we also found that the ratio @xmath69 was negatively correlated with nirxf for clusters with a distinguishable core , this correlation is weaker ( @xmath80 ) but is similar to the relation found by fl07 for a sample of nearby clusters .",
    "the significance of these correlations in the context of the structure of evolution of the rmc clusters is discussed in section [ section : discussion ] .",
    "since nirx sources trace the youngest population of stars within a star forming region , we used the distribution of nirx sources to investigate the fraction of stars located and forming in clusters .",
    "the fraction of nirx sources in clusters was calculated by simply counting the number of nirx sources within the cluster boundaries and comparing this value with the number of nirx sources outside the cluster boundaries , correcting both for background contamination .",
    "we first considered the entire area of our survey , which provided us with an estimate of the number of stars that are currently located within clusters across the entire complex . since the most recent episodes of star formation should be associated with the molecular gas , we next considered only the area within the molecular cloud , which provided us with an estimate of the fraction of stars currently forming in clusters .",
    "for the first determination , we calculated that the total area covered by the flamingos survey is 7308 sq .",
    "arcmin ( 1579 sq . pc ) while the 11 clusters identified with our analysis occupy a total surface of 390 sq .",
    "arcmin ( 84 sq . pc ) , i.e. 5.3 percent of the total survey area .",
    "the total number of nirx sources detected is @xmath81 , out of which @xmath82 are located within the boundaries of the clusters , and @xmath83 are outside the boundaries . in order to correct for the background contamination",
    ", we scaled the the number of nirx sources observed in the control fields by a factor equal to the area of the molecular cloud minus the areas of the clusters and then divided by the area of the control fields .",
    "this _ expected _ number of nirx sources due to background contamination was estimated to be @xmath84 .",
    "the background correction for individual clusters is always smaller than the poisson uncertainties but it was also applied . using these corrections ,",
    "the number of nirx sources outside of clusters was @xmath85 , and inside clusters @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the fraction of nirx sources located in young clusters across the rosette complex is @xmath87% .",
    "the area of the molecular cloud was defined by the 0.8  k@xmath13km@xmath13s@xmath14  integrated intensity contours of @xmath12co emission @xcite , corresponding to @xmath88 mag using a recently derived conversion ratio @xcite .",
    "this area equals 2684 sq arcmin ( 580 sq .",
    "the 9 clusters located in the cloud occupy a total of 242 sq .",
    "arcmin ( 52.3 sq .",
    "pc ) or about 9% of the rmc .",
    "the total number of nirx sources detected in the molecular cloud is @xmath89 , out of which @xmath90 are located within the cluster boundaries and @xmath91 are outside the boundaries . after correcting for field contamination ,",
    "the number of nirx sources located in clusters is @xmath92 and outside clusters is @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , the fraction of nirx sources currently forming in embedded clusters in the rosette molecular cloud is 86@xmath454% .",
    "interestingly , a total of 208@xmath4515 nirx sources are contained in clusters pl04 , pl05 , pl06 and refl08 , all located at the `` central core '' of the cloud .",
    "this corresponds to 48@xmath453% of the total number of embedded sources .",
    "therefore , approximately half of the recent births in the rmc have occurred at the most dense region of the cloud .",
    "we analyzed the spatial distribution of those nirx sources with 10th nn densities higher than the mean as a function of the distance to the center of ngc  2244 . to do this , we determined the surface density of sources within concentric rings centered on ngc2244 having a width of 1.0 pc .",
    "for the first 11 pc we were able to use complete rings , but further away , we had to limit the angular extent of the rings to conform with the irregular shape of the survey boundaries .",
    "the surface density of sources in each ring or segment was calculated by dividing the number of sources in each segment by its area and then diving by the surface density inside the first parsec circle .",
    "this normalized radial nirx source density distribution is shown in figure [ fig : dneb ] ( top panel ) . in the plot we indicated the approximate locations of clusters and main cores of the molecular cloud , measured in projected distance from the center of the nebula .",
    "we also indicate the location of the main regions of the rmc , the `` ridge '' , the `` central core '' , and the `` back core '' with respect to the rosette nebula .    in the bottom panel of the figure , we indicate the average fraction of nirx sources in clusters as a function of distance , averaged in five groups of clusters which are roughly traced by the distribution shown in the top panel .",
    "the cluster groups used are as follows : first group includes ngc  2244 , ngc  2237 and refl10 ; second group includes pl01 and pl02 ; third group includes pl04 , pl05 and refl08 ; fourth group includes pl03 and pl06 ; finally , group 5 includes clusters pl07 and refl09 .      in order to investigate the low density star forming component in the cloud , we closely examined the region between the central core and the back core .",
    "this region corresponds to field 09 of our survey .",
    "this field was chosen because the seeing and observing conditions for it were particularly good .",
    "specifically , the average scatter of colors down to @xmath16 remains below 0.109 mag ( similar to the average for bright end bins ) across the whole field ( see figure [ fig : area9colorscatter ] ) .",
    "this superior quality was achieved because the southeastern quadrant of the field , which in other fields presents high stellar profile distortions , overlaps with the good quality northwestern quadrant of field g1 .",
    "selective averaging of photometry in these overlapping quadrants , permitted the reduction of the total color scatter .",
    "no clusters were found in this field , but a small group of nirx sources coincide well with a roughly filamentary core in the cloud located southwest of the pl06 cluster region ( see figure [ fig : nirxpos_1575 ] ) .",
    "our nnm analysis does not produce a new cluster identification for this core , but we counted the number of nirx sources in the whole field down to brightness limits of 15.75 , 16.25 , 16.75 and 17.25 mag .",
    "we counted the number of nirx in the control fields at these same magnitude limits . in",
    "order to have make a conservative estimate , we limited the counts to a circular area with a radius of 1500 pixels centered on pixel position [ 3000,2400 ] .",
    "this delimits the area of best photometric quality after the polynomial correction , as described in section [ section : observations ] .",
    "we compared these nirx counts in field 09 with the expected number of field nirx sources at these same limits in an equivalent area of high photometric confidence in the control fields , adding again , a mean extinction level of 5.0 mag to account for stars that would have excess colors after reddening .",
    "a second comparison was done by averaging the number of observed nirx sources in equivalent photometric confidence circular areas of survey fields 03 , 13 , 14 and 15 .",
    "these fields are located in regions of the complex where the co emission from the molecular cloud is lower than average , and thus they can help to determine if the nirx sources of field 09 could indeed be a local enhancement near the core of the rmc .    in figure [",
    "fig : dp9hist ] , we compare the counts described above in the form of cumulative histograms : apparently , field 09 surpasses significantly the expected number of nirx from the control field and the off - cloud areas , with counts 4.8 , 5.6 , 3.5 and 2.2 times larger than those in the control field field at @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively .",
    "the counts are also higher than the averaged counts of survey fields 3 , 13 , 14 and 15 by factors of 1.3 , 1.5 , 1.6 and 1.8 respectively .",
    "this suggests that the region of the cloud observed in field 09 could have a significant number of young source candidates not associated with clusters .",
    "furthermore , jhk color images of selected regions of the field show a number of highly reddened sources .",
    "some of these sources have thin nebulosities , and coincide or are located close to stars with near infrared excess emission .",
    "these sources are not included in our infrared excess catalog because they were not detected in our j band observations and therefore we do not have three colors to determine if they exhibit excess emission .",
    "in addition , we counted the number of sources with no j band photometry and @xmath96 mag at the same k brightness limits mentioned above .",
    "it is not possible to assure that these sources belong to the cloud , especially for @xmath97 , where the scatter increases and the contamination by background galaxies worsens .",
    "however , we noticed that the number of these sources which locate outside the main co emission regions of the molecular cloud was very small ; the majority of them were in fact located within the cluster areas ( see figure [ fig : nojotas ] ) .",
    "therefore , these red sources could be tracing the location of young sources too .",
    "also , no stars with @xmath31 colors this large were found in the control field . in figure",
    "[ fig : nojotas ] we show the distribution of the sources with @xmath96 in the survey areas down to @xmath55 mag respectively . in table",
    "[ tab : dptable ] we show the number counts of @xmath96 sources , separating those located outside the 20.0  k@xmath13km@xmath13s@xmath14co contours , ( @xmath98 mag ) and then dividing the ones located inside the contours into those within and outside the cluster areas . after correcting by background ( in this case by subtracting the scaled number of in - survey / off - cloud sources )",
    "we estimate that the average fraction of objects with @xmath96 located inside the molecular cloud projected area but outside the clusters is approximately 21@xmath454% .",
    "the fraction is slightly larger than the one obtained from counts of nirx sources ( 14@xmath454% ) , possibly due to the fact that our red source counts are less restricted , as we can not limit their range in @xmath30 .",
    "counts of sources with large @xmath31 values have been used before to identify highly embedded clusters with good results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; in our case , our maps show that large h - k color sources trace well the regions we identified as clusters , but _ also _ show a population at the 10 to 20 percent level that might be distributed along the rest of the cloud .",
    "observations of nearby molecular clouds such as orion , perseus and monoceros suggest that most stars in these clouds form in embedded clusters ( la91 , ca00 ) . in the rmc",
    ", approximately 86 percent of the present day star formation occurs in embedded clusters , in excellent agreement with the previous results for nearby clouds .",
    "this indicates that cluster formation is also the dominant mode of star formation in clouds beyond 1 kpc .",
    "cluster formation appears to be well distributed across the rosette complex but the clusters themselves are confined to a rather small fraction ( 5 percent ) of the total area of the cloud .",
    "comparison of the distribution of embedded clusters with the distribution of molecular gas ( wbs95 ) , reveals that the embedded clusters are associated with the most massive molecular clumps in the cloud , which are also the most dynamically evolved .",
    "this is similar to what was found in the orion b cloud @xcite .",
    "while the most massive clumps in the rosette are responsible for the production of the embedded clusters , then some of less massive clumps could be associated with the distributed population .",
    "the number of sources exhibiting near - ir excess in field 09 and the number of sources with @xmath96 across the cloud could indicate that a distributed population of young stars formed in addition to the cluster population .",
    "however , the formation of this distributed population could account for no more than 20 percent of the total star formation within the rmc .",
    "characterizing the distributed population is difficult due to several observational constraints .",
    "for example , the large photometric scatter of faint sources along with the field star contamination restrict our study to the brighter ( likely higher mass ) sources , which are expected to be less numerous than the fainter ( likely lower mass ) ones .",
    "spectroscopic observations and mid - infrared imaging would help to establish the number of highly reddened sources outside the cluster regions .",
    "also , the nature the distributed population in molecular clouds is somewhat unclear as discussed by ca00 , precisely because these sources permeate through large areas of the molecular cloud in and between regions of cluster formation and thus do not have a clear origin .",
    "such a population could be the residual of a slightly older generation of star formation , a sub - product of cluster formation resulting from mass segregation or ejection or belong to a population located in the foreground or background of the cloud .",
    "the mortality rate of embedded clusters in the milky way is quite high",
    ". less than 10 percent of clusters survive their emergence from molecular clouds and live longer than 10myr and less than 4 - 7 percent survive to become bound clusters the age of the pleiades ( ll03 ) .",
    "this early disruption is most likely linked to low star formation efficiency and the rapid destruction of the molecular clouds .",
    "similar results are found in other galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the observed distribution and properties of the embedded clusters in the rosette complex may be revealing some of the first signs of such early cluster evolution .",
    "the clusters in the rosette appear to be , on average , slightly larger than those located in other clouds : the cluster equivalent radii range from @xmath99 to @xmath100  pc , with an mean of 1.44 and a median of 1.46 pc .",
    "the largest cluster in the complex is ngc 2244 , with an equivalent radius of 2.3  pc . for comparison , the sizes of clusters listed in the catalog of ll03 range from @xmath101 to @xmath102  pc , but have a mean of 0.8 pc and a median of 0.62 pc .",
    "only a few clusters in this catalog , such as monr2 , gem4 , ngc 2282 and trapezium / onc , have radii larger than 1.5 pc .",
    "it is unlikely that the rosette is systematically forming larger than average clusters . instead",
    ", the large cluster sizes may be due to dynamical evolution of the cloud leading to the beginning of cluster expansion and eventual dispersal .",
    "indeed our data suggest that cluster sizes in the rosette may be related to cluster evolution in several ways .",
    "first , we found a negative correlation between extinction and cluster sizes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : agerel ] ) , indicating that the most extended clusters are the least embedded and are the ones that are emerging from the parental molecular material .",
    "cluster sizes are also inversely proportional to their infrared excess fraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nirxfsizerel ] . )",
    "it has been shown that the infrared excess fraction in young clusters is initially high and decreases rapidly as a function of cluster age such that clusters with ages @xmath103 myr have no or extremely small excess fractions @xcite . in the rosette ,",
    "excess fraction decreases with increasing cluster size , implying that clusters expand relatively quickly ( in a time scale comparable to the t tauri phase ) .",
    "furthermore , analysis of the density structure of the embedded clusters may also indicate the beginnings of cluster evolution .",
    "for example , even though some of the rosette clusters exhibit a well defined core from our nn analysis , others appear to be extended well beyond this core . indeed , the ratio of the core size to the total size , @xmath69 , is 0.5 or above for 6 out of 8 young clusters with defined cores ( fig .",
    "[ fig : coreq ] ) indicating that most of the rosette clusters do not have prominent central condensations .",
    "in addition , @xmath69 decreases with increasing infrared excess fraction ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nirxfsizerel ] ) .",
    "a similar correlation was found by fl07 in their analysis of local clusters . in the rosette ,",
    "clusters with @xmath104 have an average infrared excess fraction of 27 percent whereas clusters with @xmath105 have an average irx fraction of 52% .",
    "these results suggest that clusters form as compact units and later become less centrally condensed . this initial expansion appears to start quickly after formation and likely develops within a few myr , favoring a scenario of rapid disruption and cluster dispersal .",
    "the layout of the rosette complex led wbs95 and pl97 to suggest that the formation of the clusters was triggered by the expansion of the nebula into the cloud , resembling the picture of sequential star formation proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the shock front from an expanding hii region would trigger the formation of a new ob association in an adjacent molecular cloud which would later trigger a third group and so on .",
    "we can use the distribution of young stars and clusters in our survey to investigate what effect , the hii region has had on the star forming properties of the cloud .",
    "star formation in the rosette appears to be concentrated into 4 main areas of the complex as illustrated in figure 24 .",
    "the most prominent is the rosette nebula itself , which contains the clusters ngc 2244 , ngc 2237 and refl10 .",
    "the next concentration of star formation is located between 10 to 20 pc from the center of ngc 2244 , corresponding to the rmc ridge .",
    "this region is located the closest to and overlaps with the ionization front of the hii region and contains clusters pl01 and pl02 .",
    "it has the lowest levels of star forming activity .",
    "star formation may be inhibited in this area due to the effects of the ionizing radiation .",
    "hot ionized gas might accelerate the evaporation of gaseous material surrounding a forming cluster , resulting in the end of the star forming process .",
    "the third concentration of young stars is located 20 to 30 pc from ngc 2244 and contains clusters pl04 , pl05 , refl08 and pl06 at the rmc `` central core '' and pl03 located in a gas clump ( core d ) outside the main area of the cloud .",
    "the four clusters in the central core account for 48% of the present day star formation in the molecular cloud while only covering roughly 4% of the cloud area .",
    "these cores are associated with four of the most massive cores in the cloud ( wbs95 ) .",
    "similarly high concentrations of star formation have been observed in other molecular clouds such as orion , w3/w4/w5 and perseus , where approximately half of the young stars are found in only 1 to a few embedded clusters @xcite .",
    "the rmc central core appears to coincide with the edge of the rosette nebula as shown by images of radio continuum and 25@xmath106 iras emission .",
    "the studies of @xcite , wbs95 and @xcite agree that the nebula and molecular cloud have their most intense interaction at this region and this may indicate the recent passage of the shock front from the nebula . the interaction with the shock front may have triggered or stimulated the production of stars here resulting in the second most active region of star formation in the complex .",
    "the last concentration of star forming activity is at the `` back core '' of the cloud .",
    "this region contains clusters pl07 and refl09 .",
    "these two clusters appear to have formed in a region of the cloud located beyond the main interaction with the nebula @xcite .",
    "given their distance from the shock front , it is unlikely that the formation of these clusters was triggered .",
    "this reinforces the suggestion by pl97 that star formation in this part of the cloud occurred spontaneously .",
    "surprisingly , we do find the first evidence for a possible temporal sequence in star forming events in the rosette .",
    "the average cluster infrared excess fraction increases as a function of distance from ngc 2244 , suggesting that the embedded clusters are progressively younger the further they are from the nebula .",
    "the existence of this apparent age sequence indicates that star formation in the rosette did indeed take place sequentially in time , but not in the way proposed by @xcite .",
    "instead , it appears that the overall age sequence of cluster formation is independent of any interaction with the expanding hii region but rather may be primordial , possibly resulting from the formation and evolution of the molecular cloud itself . while the existence of the hii region can not be responsible for the sequence of cluster ages , it does appear to have a significant impact on the underlying sequence by either enhancing or inhibiting the star forming process .",
    "\\1 . in this paper",
    "we present results of a deep near - ir survey of the rosette complex .",
    "the survey was made with the wide field imager flamingos at the kitt peak 2.1 m telescope and covers all the main areas of the rosette nebula and the rosette molecular cloud    \\2 .",
    "we analyze the distribution of young stellar sources in the complex by estimating the surface densities of objects with infrared excess , using a variation of the nearest neighbor method , which allows us to find clusters with minimum populations of @xmath107 members .",
    "we confirmed the existence of the seven embedded clusters found by visual inspection by pl97 and found four more clusters in the complex .",
    "two of these clusters are deeply embedded in the molecular cloud and the other two are located west of ngc 2244 in the rosette nebula .",
    "the young cluster population accounts for 60 percent of the stars in the complex , and approximately 86 percent of the youngest stars , located in the molecular cloud .",
    "this implies that the majority of stars in the rosette form in embedded clusters , similar to nearby clouds . .",
    "the sizes of clusters in the rosette complex appear to be anti - correlated with their mean extinctions and infrared excess fractions , which suggests that clusters form as compact units then expand shortly after formation .",
    "the timescale for this process is similar or even shorter than the t tauri phase , as evidenced by the significant nirx fractions and deeply embedded status .",
    "the distribution of young clusters suggests a division of star formation into four main regions coincident with the largest features of the cloud : the first is the rosette nebula , which contains the oldest clusters , the second is the ridge , located near to the ionization front of the hii region , the third is the central core of the molecular cloud , where the main interaction between the nebula and the cloud is located , and approximately 50 percent of the young stellar population was produced .",
    "the fourth region of formation is at the back core of the cloud , located furthest from the nebula .",
    ". the averaged infrared excess fraction of these regions appears to increase as a function of distance from the rosette nebula , which is suggestive of a sequence of cluster ages across the cloud . rather than being triggered by the hii region , this sequence appears to be primordial , possibly resulting from the formation and evolution of the molecular cloud .",

    "<S> we present the results of a deep near - infrared imaging survey of the rosette complex made with the florida multi - object imaging spectrograph ( flamingos ) at the 2.1 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory . </S>",
    "<S> we studied the distribution of young embedded sources using a variation of the nearest neighbor method applied to a carefully selected sample of near - infrared excess ( nirx ) stars which trace the latest episode of star formation in the complex . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis confirmed the existence of seven clusters previously detected in the molecular cloud , and identified four more clusters across the complex . </S>",
    "<S> we determined that 60% of the young stars in the complex and 86% of the stars within the molecular cloud are contained in clusters , implying that the majority of stars in the rosette formed in embedded clusters . </S>",
    "<S> also , half of the young embedded population is contained in four clusters that coincide with the central core of the cloud , where the main interaction between with the hii region is taking place . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the sizes , infrared excess fractions and average extinction towards individual clusters to investigate their early evolution and expansion . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the size and degree of central condensation within the clusters appear to be related to the degree of infrared excess and mean extinction in a way that suggests that the clusters form as compact entities and then quickly expand after formation . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the average infrared excess fraction of clusters increases as a function of distance from ngc 2244 , implying a temporal sequence of star formation across the complex . </S>",
    "<S> this sequence appears to be primordial , possibly resulting from the formation and evolution of the molecular cloud and not from the interaction with the hii region . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the main influence of the hii region could be to enhance or inhibit the underlying pattern of star formation in the cloud . </S>"
