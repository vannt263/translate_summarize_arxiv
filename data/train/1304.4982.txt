    "correlation matrices for time series are an old subject of research @xcite and wishart @xcite has introduced white noise ( stochastic ) time series as a null hypothesis @xcite to identify _ actual _ underlying cross correlations .",
    "more recently there have been advances incorporating correlations in random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "applications @xcite have been varied with an emphasis on financial time series @xcite , both because of their importance and their ready availability .",
    "correlations are seen in stock - exchange data , resulting in large eigenvalues which represent the overall market movement and the industrial sectors @xcite .    applications usually imply stationarity of the time series after eliminating some well known trends . the problem we wish to address results from the fact that we may well have a much larger number of time series than the number of time steps over which the time series can reasonably be considered as stationary .",
    "this situation leads to correlation matrices that are highly singular .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to study the properties of such matrices in presence of correlations .",
    "correlations measure the degree of linear dependence between the stochastic components of different time series .",
    "estimation errors arise due to the finite length of time series on which correlations are estimated .",
    "it is essential to suppress the corresponding noise in correlation matrices to reveal the actual correlations .",
    "various techniques are available @xcite . among these",
    "we shall use a recent and efficient one , namely the power map @xcite both for noise reduction and for a purpose , quite different from the one for which it was designed and more central to our paper .    in the problem",
    "we wish to address we do not have long time series usual for the application of the power map .",
    "yet we wish to use this map because of its non - linearity .",
    "the power map operates directly on the correlation matrix by the simple means of elevating the absolute value of the matrix elements to a power greater than one while conserving their phase .",
    "this will lift the degeneracy of the zero eigenvalues of the singular correlation matrix .",
    "the thus emerging spectrum gives us a handle to get more information from the eigenvalues without looking at the entire correlation matrix as in @xcite .",
    "this may be useful because the correlation matrix contains considerable redundancies , if the number of time series is much larger than twice the length of the time series .",
    "yet the first step will be to check , whether in such a context the power map will still provide the desired noise reduction ( see @xcite as well ) ; thus in the next section we shall test , in a simple model , whether noise reduction by means of the power map is effective for singular correlation matrices .",
    "next we proceed to the main part of our results , which will be to analyze the behavior of wishart ensembles ( we ) of singular matrices @xcite , including correlated wishart ensembles ( cwe ) , under the power map deformations",
    ".    the analysis will be partially numerical and partially by linear response studies to obtain approximate analytical expressions for powers near identity .",
    "maybe the most important finding is that the part of the spectrum we get by lifting the degeneracy at zero is sensitive to correlations and for powers near identity is well separated from the bulk , which in turn is only little affected .",
    "the main focus of this work will be centered on this part of the spectrum , which we call the _ emerging spectrum_.    in the next section we will give an example of the effectiveness of the power map for noise reduction in singular correlation matrices .",
    "the third section gives the framework in which we shall discuss correlated random matrix ensembles . in the following section we shall discuss the emerging spectra for a wishart orthogonal ensemble without correlations comparing linear response analytics with numerics . in sec . v we perform a similar analysis for two types of correlated wishart ensembles though the analytic part is more restricted in this section . in sec .",
    "vi we summarize our results and give an outlook on possible applications .",
    "normalized to the minimal portfolio variance @xmath0 .",
    "the length @xmath1 of the time series was varied , the number of companies was fixed at @xmath2 .",
    "results are shown for sample correlations without noise reduction ( black dashed - dotted line ) and for power - mapped correlations ( blue solid line).the red dashed line at @xmath3 corresponds to a homogeneous portfolio.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]    as the power map has mainly been discussed for regular matrices we start giving a brief discussion of previously unpublished ( see also @xcite ) results for this case from the realm of econophyscs . in this section",
    "we shall use standard notations of econophysics as summarized in appendix [ app : opt ] . following markowitz  @xcite",
    ", we consider a portfolio of @xmath4 stocks and wish to calculate the portfolio weights @xmath5 which minimize the portfolio variance @xmath6 in a model setting , we can calculate the minimal variance portfolio @xmath0 using the model covariance matrix @xmath7 . in practice , however , the covariance matrix has to be estimated using historical data of finite length @xmath1 .",
    "the shorter the length @xmath1 of the time series , the noisier is the covariance estimation . using noisy covariance matrices for portfolio optimization leads to very bad results , see fig .",
    "[ pmbeyond ] . in this case",
    ", the portfolio variance @xmath8 increases as @xmath9 , in accordance with literature  @xcite . clearly , it is necessary to improve the estimation of the covariance matrix to obtain better results .",
    "the variances of the single stocks can be estimated rather well on short time horizons due to a slowly decaying autocorrelation .",
    "the noise in the correlation coefficients @xmath10 can be reduced effectively using the power map @xmath11 the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ pmbeyond ] . the power map yields portfolio variances which are well below the homogeneous portfolio with all weights equal to @xmath12 , even for @xmath13 where the correlation matrix becomes singular .",
    "the values for @xmath14 used in this study range from 1.1 to 2.4 . for details of the simulation we refer to appendix [ app : opt ] .",
    "in random matrix theory one studies basically three invariant wishart ensembles @xcite . in this paper we consider only wishart orthogonal ensemble ( woe ) .",
    "similarly we consider the correlated wishart orthogonal ensemble ( cwoe ) among the three invariant cwes .",
    "a wishart matrix is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an @xmath17 matrix and @xmath18 is the transpose of @xmath16 . for woe",

    "the jpd of the eigenvalues of @xmath20 , @xmath28 , for @xmath29 , may be obtained by transforming the variables to eigenvalue - eigenvector space and then integrating over the eigenvectors .",
    "it leads to @xmath30 where @xmath31/2}\\exp[-n\\kappa \\lambda/2\\sigma^{2}]$ ] is the weight function of the associated laguerre polynomials hence woe is often referred to as laguerre orthogonal ensemble in literature @xcite . for @xmath32 ,",
    "@xmath20 is singular and has exactly @xmath33 zero eigenvalues .",
    "the jpd of the matrix elements and the jpd of the eigenvalues in this case have been derived in @xcite , where again laguerre weight functions describe jpd of the latter .",
    "the eigenvalue statistics of woe are known in great detail @xcite .",
    "for instance , the global statistics , i.e. the eigenvalue density , as well as the local statistics , i.e. the @xmath34-point spectral correlation functions for @xmath35 , are known in terms of laguerre polynomials . however , for @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and finite , the ensemble averaged eigenvalue density converges to the marenko pastur law @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the end points of the density .",
    "we use here and further down bar to denote ensemble averaging .",
    "note that for the singular case , i.e. @xmath40 , @xmath41 in the above equation is normalized to @xmath42 and not to @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , taking into account of @xmath33 zeros , for @xmath44 we write @xmath45 when expressed in terms of unit average spacing the @xmath34-point correlation functions , for large matrices , are the same as those for gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite , and therefore woe spectra have universal spectral fluctuations @xcite .    in the case of actual correlations among the matrix elements",
    "@xmath46 , one defines cwoe @xcite .",
    "for instance , in order to take account of the correlation in the rows of @xmath16 matrix one defines @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a fixed positive definite matrix which takes account of nonrandom correlations and where the matrix elements @xmath49 are independent gaussian variables with zero mean and a fixed variance , just as the @xmath46 defined for the woe .",
    "we remark that in this definition @xmath50 while @xmath51 is an identity matrix of dimension @xmath52 .",
    "analytical treatment to cwoe @xcite is much more difficult and involved than to woe .",
    "however , some results are known in this case as well . for instance , analogous to the marenko pastur result , the resolvent or stieltjes transform of the density is known as @xmath53 where angular brackets denote the spectral averaging .",
    "the density @xmath41 can be determined uniquely via inverse transformation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is infinitesimal . for finite @xmath4 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the density has been recently obtained @xcite by using the supersymmetric method . for higher order spectral correlations , only asymptotic result for the two - point function",
    "is known @xcite .",
    "spectral fluctuations of cwoe are not always universal ; rather there are deviations in some cases , as noted for the number variance @xcite , @xmath56 , for large spectral correlation length @xmath57 . in some cases , however , a few eigenvalues are found to be separated from the bulk density .",
    "these eigenvalues often show collective behaviour , therefore , referred to as the collective modes .",
    "we omit further details here , however interested readers may find a detailed discussion on the spectral properties of cwes in @xcite .",
    "the emerging spectra , we wish to study for the woe , may be observed even for @xmath14 very near to identity . before developing an analytic approach we mention a few important spectral properties of @xmath58 as observed in simple numerical simulations .",
    "first we note that @xmath58 is always real symmetric ; thus it has real eigenvalues .",
    "however , for @xmath59 , it may have negative eigenvalues specially when @xmath1 is much smaller than @xmath4 .",
    "the density function of the eigenvalues of @xmath58 , appears on two well separated supports .",
    "the first one is close to zero while the other is close to the support defined by the marenko - pastur density ( [ denmp ] ) .",
    "the former results from the breaking of degeneracy of the zero eigenvalues of @xmath20 while the latter is due to small corrections to non - zero spectrum .",
    "as we increase the power to values usually used for noise reduction , the two supports begin to overlap .",

    "note that we not only have found spectral characteristics distinctive of correlations in the emerging spectra , but also some characteristic properties of the eigenvectors appear , as we saw in the case of block - diagonal correlations . separated individual eigenvalues appear those characterize the blocks , as can be verified also from the eigenvectors pertaining to these eigenvalues . in sec .",
    "ii we showed that the power map is also an efficient tool to suppress noise in a correlation analysis involving short time series leading to singular matrices .",
    "thus the same tool can be used to fulfill a standard requirement of a correlation analysis , namely noise suppression and to access the zero - eigenvalue subspace .",
    "we use random matrix ensembles introduced by wishart to obtain the emerging spectra for random white noise time series that serve as reference for lack of information i.e. as null hypothesis .",
    "these ensembles have been generalized to include actual correlations , as correlations constitute the information we seek .",
    "we show by means of linear response calculations and numerical analysis that the emerging spectra for such ensembles are very sensitive to the presence or absence of correlations .",
    "this is an essential point , as it allows to detect changes in the underlying dynamical structures of a non - stationary system .",
