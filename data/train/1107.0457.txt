    "the problem of sudden expansion of hot plasma into a vacuum in the presence of an external magnetic field has been intensively studied in the mid-1960s in connection with the high - altitude nuclear explosions .",
    "it has also been discussed in the analysis of many astrophysical and laboratory applications ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "such kind of processes arise during the dynamics of solar flares and flow of the solar wind around the earth s magnetosphere , in active experiments with plasma clouds in space , and in the course of interpreting a number of astrophysical observations @xcite .",
    "researches on this problem are of considerable interest in connection with the experiments on controlled thermonuclear fusion @xcite ( a review @xcite summarizes research in this area over the past four decades ) .",
    "the expanding plasma pushes magnetic field out which is a consequence of magnetic flux conservation .",
    "due to the plasma expansion the surface of the given magnetic flux tube inside plasma increases .",
    "the conservation of the magnetic flux through the surface of the tube leads to a decrease of the local magnetic field and the formation of the diamagnetic cavity .",
    "thus even if a magnetic field is nonzero initially inside the plasma it tends to zero during plasma expansion .",
    "in addition , the plasma is shielded from the penetration of the external field by means of surface currents circulating inside the thin layer on the plasma boundary .",
    "ponderomotive forces resulting from interaction of these currents with the magnetic field would act on the plasma surface as if there were magnetic pressure applied from outside .",
    "thus after some period of accelerated motion , plasma gets decelerated as a result of this external force acting inward .",
    "the plasma has been considered as a highly conducting media with zero magnetic field inside . from the point of view of electrodynamics",
    "it is similar to the expansion of a superconductor in a magnetic field .",
    "an exact self - similar analytic solution for a uniformly expanding , highly conducting plasma sphere in an external uniform and constant magnetic field has been obtained in @xcite . the non - relativistic limit of this theory has been used by raizer @xcite to analyze the energy balance ( energy emission and transformation ) during the plasma expansion .",
    "the similar problem has been considered in @xcite within one - dimensional geometry for a plasma layer . in our recent papers @xcite and @xcite",
    "we obtained an exact self - similar analytic solution for the uniform relativistic expansion of the highly conducting plasma sphere or cylinder in the presence of a dipole or homogeneous magnetic field , respectively .",
    "as mentioned above the previous treatments @xcite were obtained assuming somewhat idealized situation : uniform expansion , zero magnetic field and thermal pressure inside plasma , etc .",
    "obviously such simplified models are not capable to describe correctly the plasma expansion dynamics where an essential deceleration ( or acceleration ) of the plasma boundary may occur .",
    "more realistic models for the plasma self - similar expansion have been developed , for instance , in @xcite ( see also references therein ) for planar ( one - dimensional ) @xcite and cylindrical @xcite expansions employing ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations .",
    "it should be noted that the ideal mhd is well justified since the typical experimental parameters are such that the expanding plasma is collisionless and the dissipative effects are negligible @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the expansion of the spherical plasma cloud in the presence of a dipole or homogeneous magnetic field taking into account the thermal effects .",
    "we employ the self - similar solution of a similar problem which deals with expansion of spherical plasma into a vacuum without magnetic field . unlike the previous studies @xcite we concentrate here on the dynamics ( deceleration and/or acceleration ) of the sharp plasma boundary .",
    "we found an analytical solution which can be used in analyzing the recent experimental and simulation data ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "usually the motion of the expanding plasma boundary is approximated as the motion with constant velocity ( uniform expansion ) . in the present study a quantitative analysis of plasma dynamics",
    "is developed on the basis of one - dimensional spherical radial model . within the scope of this analysis the initial stage of plasma acceleration , later stage of deceleration and the process of stopping at the point of maximum expansion are examined .",
    "we consider a collisionless magnetized plasma expanding into vacuum .",
    "the relevant equations governing the expansion are those of ideal mhd @xcite assuming that the characteristic length scales for the plasma flow are much larger than the debye length and the larmor radius of the ions .",
    "thus @xmath0   = \\frac{1}{4\\pi } \\left [ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{h}\\right ] \\times \\mathbf{h}-\\nabla p , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{h}}{\\partial t } = \\nabla \\times \\left [ \\mathbf{v } \\times \\mathbf{h}\\right ] , \\quad \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{h } = 0 , \\label{eq : a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the mass density , the velocity , the magnetic field , and the pressure respectively .",
    "these equations must be accompanied by the adiabatic equation of state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the adiabatic index , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume , respectively ) and the equation of conservation of entropy , which expresses the fact that the plasma dynamics is adiabatic in the absence of dissipation . using the thermodynamic relation between entropy , pressure , and internal energy as well as equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) the equation for pressure reads @xcite @xmath9",
    "the equation of conservation of energy is derived from the system of equations ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and is given by @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the energy and energy flux densities , respectively , with @xmath13 \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq : a4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the energy @xmath11 consists of the kinetic ( first term ) , the internal ( second term ) and the magnetic field ( third term ) energies .",
    "the last term in the energy flux density @xmath12 represents the poynting vector ( let us recall that in ideal mhd the electric field is given by @xmath14 $ ] ) .    with the theoretical basis presented so far , we now take up the main topic of this paper .",
    "this is to study the dynamics of the plasma boundary expanding in an ambient magnetic field .",
    "consider the magnetic dipole @xmath15 and a plasma spherical cloud with radius @xmath16 located at the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "the dipole is placed in the position @xmath17 from the center of the plasma cloud ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the orientation of the dipole is given by the angle @xmath19 between the vectors @xmath15 and @xmath17 .",
    "we denote the strength of the magnetic field of the dipole by @xmath20 .",
    "the energy , which is transferred from plasma to electromagnetic field is the mechanical work performed by the plasma on the external magnetic pressure @xmath21 .",
    "taking into account this effect and the energy conservation ( [ eq : a3 ] ) integrated over the spherical plasma volume @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) the equation of balance of plasma energy is as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the volume of the spherical shell @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 are the initial radius and energy of the plasma .",
    "when the plasma cloud is introduced into a background magnetic field , the plasma expands and excludes the background magnetic field to form a magnetic cavity .",
    "the magnetic energy of the dipole in the excluded volume is represented by the last term in equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "initial plasma velocity is supposed to be @xmath30 at @xmath31 and @xmath32 at @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the initial velocity of the plasma boundary ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the obtained energy balance equation can be effectively used if profiles of velocity @xmath36 , pressure @xmath37 , and mass density @xmath38 are known functions of the plasma radius @xmath16 .",
    "we will take these dependencies from the solution of a similar problem which deals with sudden expansion of spherical plasma into a vacuum without ambient magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the simplest class of solutions available in this case are so - called self - similar solutions .",
    "they are realized under the specified initial conditions .",
    "we will set the initial conditions with a parabolic distribution of pressure and mass density , which describe hot and dense initial plasma state with sharp boundary localized at @xmath39 .",
    "the self - similar solutions are characterized by a velocity distribution linearly dependent on @xmath40 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at @xmath41 @xmath42 where unknown @xmath16 is the radius of sharp plasma boundary while @xmath43 is the velocity of the boundary .",
    "the specification of the mass density profile at @xmath41 is given by @xmath44^{q } \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] and equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) for the velocity , automatically satisfies the continuity equation in ( [ eq : a1 ] ) for an arbitrary function @xmath16 and for an arbitrary parameter @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the total mass of plasma cloud and @xmath47 is the euler function .",
    "substitution of @xmath36 into the entropy equation ( [ eq : a2 ] ) gives at @xmath41 the following solution for the pressure @xmath48 ^{3\\gamma } \\left [ 1-\\frac{r^{2}}{a^{2}\\left ( t\\right ) } \\right]^{s } , \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath50 is the thermal pressure at the center of the spherical plasma cloud at @xmath51 .",
    "in addition the quantities @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath37 vanish at @xmath52 , @xmath53 . substituting ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq:4 ] ) into the fluid equation of motion ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and neglecting the term involving the magnetic field @xmath3 yields a second - order differential equation governing the motion of the plasma boundary @xmath16 .",
    "the problem considered is not isentropic in general except the case when @xmath54 . in the latter case of the isentropic expansion the equation of state",
    "is given by @xmath55 . throughout in this paper",
    "we will assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 . the self - similar solution given by equations ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) has been considered by many authors .",
    "we refer to @xcite ( see also the references therein ) for details and for some applications of this solution .",
    "there are several limitations and shortcomings of the self - similar model considered above .",
    "it should be emphasized that in general the plasma expansion process with and without ambient magnetic field is not self - similar since there is a characteristic length scale , that is , the initial radius of the plasma @xmath58 .",
    "however , during the later stage ( when @xmath59 ) the plasma expansion asymptotically approaches to the self - similar regime since the role of the radius @xmath58 becomes less important .",
    "this property is supported by the asymptotic solution of the system of partial differential equations ( [ eq : a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : a2 ] ) @xcite as well as by the numerical simulations @xcite for the free expansion ( i.e. at @xmath60 ) .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that at the beginning stage of the expansion the deviation of the solution ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) from non - similar one is small and is additionally reduced due to the spatial average in the equation of energy balance ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) are an exact solution in the case of expansion into a vacuum without magnetic field .",
    "however , equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) does not satisfy the boundary condition , @xmath61 , which is imposed in the case of expansion into an ambient magnetic field .",
    "therefore , in the present case with nonzero magnetic field for the validity of the equations ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) most critical is the domain close to the boundary of the plasma , @xmath62 . on the other hand",
    "if the magnetic pressure is smaller than the plasma average pressure @xmath63 , @xmath64 , the difference between the exact solution in the magnetic field and free expansion model is small and is localized in a narrow area near the surface of the cloud .",
    "these deviations are additionally reduced due to the integration in the equation of energy balance . estimating accuracy of the free expansion model",
    ", one should take into account that the long stage of plasma deceleration corresponds to a high expansion ratio , @xmath65 .",
    "average plasma pressure drops significantly and plays no role in energy balance equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) during this stage . in accordance with the above boundary condition local pressure near the plasma edge",
    "must be equal to the magnetic pressure outside .",
    "it causes deviation from the profile equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) and accumulation of plasma in this area .",
    "this is confirmed independently by the numerical simulations @xcite . in the limiting case when all plasma is localized near the front",
    ", one can expect an increase of the kinetic energy and longer stage of plasma deceleration as compared with the self - similar expansion model .",
    "another critical domain for the violation of the self - similar solution ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) is the final stage of expansion when the plasma is fully stopped by the magnetic field . as mentioned above the average plasma pressure",
    "is strongly reduced compared to the magnetic pressure and the equations ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) clearly become invalid in this case .",
    "however , if the critical time interval @xmath66 , where @xmath67 , is much smaller than the typical time scale of the plasma flow ( up to the full stop ) the contribution of this interval to the overall plasma dynamics is negligible and the use of the self - similar solution is justified .    in the case of dipole magnetic field",
    "the volume integral in the last term of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) has been evaluated in @xcite .",
    "the result reads @xmath68 , \\label{eq:5}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( note that @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 -\\frac{3\\cos ^{2}\\theta _ { p}-1}{2}\\ln \\frac{1+\\eta } { 1-\\eta } .    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting equations  ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) into ( [ eq:1 ] ) and integrating over @xmath40 yields first - order differential equation for @xmath16 , which already satisfies initial condition @xmath73 , @xmath74 = 1 .",
    "\\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] here two dimensionless quantities are introduced @xmath75 which determine the magnetic and the thermal energies , respectively , in terms of the total initial energy @xmath29 .",
    "the latter is easily obtained from equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) and reads @xmath76 from equations  ( [ eq:8 ] ) and ( [ eq:9 ] ) it is seen that @xmath77 .",
    "new dimensionless variables are introduced as follows : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , where @xmath81^{1/2}$ ] is the velocity of plasma expansion , achieved asymptotically at @xmath82 in the case of expansion into a vacuum without magnetic field ( i.e. at @xmath83 ) .",

    "consider also the case of uniform magnetic field when @xmath87 . in this case the volume integral in equation  ( [ eq:5 ] ) is replaced by @xmath88 and the differential equation ( [ eq:7 ] ) for the plasma boundary reads @xmath89=1 , \\label{eq:11}\\]]where @xmath90 , @xmath91 is the initial magnetic energy in the plasma volume , and @xmath92 is the magnetic field pressure .    equations ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) coincide with the equation of the one - dimensional motion of the point - like particle in the potential @xmath93 which is determined by second and third terms of equations  ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "the distance @xmath94 of the plasma cloud motion up to the full stop ( the stopping length ) at the turning point is determined by @xmath95 .",
    "in particular , it is easier to obtain the stopping length in the case of homogeneous magnetic field and at vanishing thermal pressure ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "then from equation  ( [ eq:11 ] ) one obtains the equation of motion @xmath97 it is seen that in this case the stopping length is given by @xmath98 .",

    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of weak magnetic field , @xmath104 , and at vanishing thermal pressure ( @xmath96 ) the stopping time does not depend on the initial plasma radius , @xmath110 .",
    "we now turn to the general equations determined by ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) . at the initial stage of plasma expansion ( @xmath111 ) from these equations",
    "we obtain @xmath112 where @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 for the dipole and homogeneous magnetic fields , respectively . here",
    "the prime indicates the derivative with respect to the argument .",
    "thus at the initial stage the plasma cloud may get accelerated or decelerated depending on the sign of the quantity @xmath116 ( in other words on the relation between thermal and magnetic pressures ) .",
    "for instance , in the homogeneous magnetic field the acceleration occurs when @xmath117 , where @xmath118 ( i.e. at @xmath119 ) and continues until @xmath120 reaches some value @xmath121 given by @xmath122 .",
    "the time interval @xmath123 of the acceleration is determined from the equation of motion ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",
    "the critical radius @xmath124 and time @xmath125 correspond to the beginning of plasma deceleration .",
    "further plasma motion at @xmath126 is an expansion with slowing - down velocity .",
    "it ends up at the turning point which corresponds to the maximum of expansion , @xmath95 .",
    "however , in the opposite case of the low thermal pressure with @xmath127 the plasma systematically get decelerated in the whole time interval of its dynamics .",

    "this approximation is expressed by the second part of equation  ( [ eq:16 ] ) . in the case of weak and homogeneous magnetic field",
    "this yields universal expressions , @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in the case of weak magnetic field the stopping time and length do not depend on the initial plasma radius but depend on the thermal pressure ( or temperature ) ( cf . these relations with those obtained above ) .",
    "at very strong magnetic fields , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , and the stopping characteristics of the plasma essentially depend on the initial radius but are now independent on the thermal pressure .",
    "the similar estimates can be found for the dipole magnetic field .",
    "however , we note that the latter case significantly differs from the homogeneous field situation considered above .",
    "since in the vicinity of the dipole the magnetic field is arbitrary large the stopping length can not naturally exceed @xmath143 for any thermal energy of the plasma ( @xmath144 in ( [ eq:7 ] ) ) .",
    "for a weak magnetic field this simply yields @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "( left panel ) and the stopping time @xmath147 ( right panel ) of the plasma cloud expanding in a dipole magnetic field vs the normalized dipole magnetic field @xmath148 at @xmath130 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and for @xmath149 ( solid lines ) , @xmath131 ( dashed lines ) and @xmath150 ( dotted lines).,width=491 ]    as an example in figure  [ fig:1 ] we show the results of model calculations for the normalized radius @xmath151 ( left panel ) and the velocity @xmath128 ( right panel ) as a function of time ( in units of @xmath129 ) at @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133 and for different values of the parameter @xmath152 . in this figure the dimensionless strengths @xmath152 of the dipole magnetic field are chosen such that the coefficient @xmath116 in equation  ( [ eq:15 ] ) is positive , @xmath119 , for solid and dashed lines and negative , @xmath153 , for dotted lines . from the right panel of figure  [ fig:1 ]",
    "it is seen that at @xmath119 ( solid and dashed lines ) there is a short initial period of acceleration , @xmath154 , when the plasma boundary is accelerated according to equation  ( [ eq:15 ] ) . during this period ( which is only weakly sensitive to the magnetic field strength ) the dimensionless radius @xmath151 increases up to @xmath155 , and at",
    "@xmath156 almost all initial total energy @xmath29 is transferred into kinetic energy of free radial expansion at constant velocity @xmath157 . as expected ( see above )",
    "the time @xmath125 is reduced with increasing the strength of the magnetic field and the free expansion period is shorter for larger @xmath152 .",
    "the further increasing the strength of the magnetic field ( figure  [ fig:1 ] , dotted line ) results in a plasma dynamics with systematically slowing - down velocity .    for the same set of the parameters @xmath158 , @xmath159 and @xmath19 in figure  [ fig:2 ]",
    "it is shown the normalized stopping length ( left panel ) and the stopping time ( right panel ) of the plasma cloud as a function of the dimensionless strength @xmath152 of the dipole magnetic field for some values of the normalized plasma thermal pressure @xmath160 .",
    "it is seen that the stopping length and time decrease with the strength of the magnetic field and practically are not sensitive to the variation of the plasma thermal pressure .",
    "note that at otherwise unchanged parameters the strength of the dipole magnetic field is maximal at the orientation @xmath133 and monotonically decreases with @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , the strength @xmath161 of the dipole magnetic field at the center of the plasma cloud is reduced by a factor of @xmath162 by varying the dipole orientation from @xmath133 to @xmath163 .",
    "therefore the effect of the magnetic field shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] is weakened at the orientation @xmath163 of the dipole .",
    "in particular , this results in a larger stopping lengths and times than those shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "in this paper we have assumed that the self - similar solutions ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) and hence the shape of the plasma remain isotropic during plasma expansion .",
    "such assumption is not evident since the distribution of the magnetic pressure on the plasma surface is anisotropic in general .",
    "thus one can expect strong deformation of the initially spherical plasma surface .",
    "consider briefly this effect assuming constant magnetic field @xmath164 .",
    "taking into account the effect of the induced magnetic field the total magnetic pressure on the plasma surface is @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the angle between the radius vector @xmath167 and @xmath164 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic pressure vanishes at @xmath168 and is maximal at @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the spherical shape of the plasma is deformed into the ellipsoidal one which is elongated along the magnetic field lines .",
    "this effect is supported by the numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , the isotropic self - similar model considered here is valid as long as the deformation of the plasma shape is much smaller than the typical length scale for the plasma flow .",
    "however , while the solution ( [ eq:2])-([eq:4 ] ) is violated in the case of strong anisotropy the plasma dynamics can be described ( at least qualitatively ) by equations ( [ eq:11])-([eq:16 ] ) replacing the isotropic magnetic pressure @xmath170 by the angular dependent one @xmath171 .",
    "the expansion radius @xmath172 as well as the stopping length @xmath173 and time @xmath174 should be also anisotropic in this case .",
    "an analytical self - similar solution of the radial expansion of a spherical plasma cloud in the presence of a dipole or homogeneous magnetic field has been obtained .",
    "the analysis of the plasma expansion into ambient magnetic field shows that there are processes of acceleration , retardation and stopping at the point of maximum expansion that are very distinct and separated in space and time .",
    "the scaling laws obtained are , in general , the functions of two dimensionless parameters , @xmath152 ( or @xmath175 for constant magnetic field ) and @xmath160 , which can be varied by means of the choice of the external magnetic field , the thermal pressure and the initial energy of the plasma .",
    "it allows to test the different regimes of the plasma dynamics in a wide range of external conditions .",
    "we expect our theoretical findings to be useful in experimental investigations as well as in numerical simulations of the plasma expansion into an ambient magnetic field ( either uniform or nonuniform ) .",
    "one of the improvements of our present model will be the derivation of the dynamical equation for the plasma surface deformation . in this case",
    "it is evident that the problem is not isotropic with respect to the center of the plasma cloud ( @xmath176 ) and a full three - dimensional analysis is required .",
