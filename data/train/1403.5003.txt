    "suppose alice wants to send a message to bob but they can communicate only through a one - way classical noisy channel .",
    "how much information can she send to him on average , such that bob learns alice s message with zero probability of error ?",
    "this is known as the zero - error channel - coding problem . since its introduction by shannon @xcite , several generalizations to multi - party settings",
    "have been proposed and a large research area in the intersection of information theory and combinatorics has been developed ( see @xcite for a survey ) .    recently , cubitt et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the entanglement - assisted version of the two - party problem : how much data can alice send to bob with zero error when they are connected through a one - way classical noisy channel and share an entangled quantum state ? does entanglement allow to transmit more information ?",
    "an affirmative answer for the latter question was given in @xcite and @xcite where are shown channels exhibiting a separation between the entanglement - assisted and classical communication .",
    "two parties can communicate strictly more if they share a certain entangled state than what they could do in the classical case .",
    "note that this separation holds only for the special case where we want the communication to succeed with zero error . as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) , sharing entanglement does not provide any advantage in the more general case of vanishing error probability , where we ask the probability of error to asymptotically go to zero as the number of uses of the channel goes to infinity .",
    "inspired by these results , we continue this line of research by investigating the effect of quantum entanglement in two multi - party zero - error communication scenarios .    in the first situation we study",
    ", one sender is connected through identical classical channels to multiple receivers .",
    "this is known as a _ compound channel_. we prove that , for any fixed number of uses of the channel , entanglement might improve the communication only up to a certain number of receivers ( theorem  [ thm : qmonogamy ] ) .",
    "the effect is due to the monogamy of entanglement ( or more generally , of non - signaling correlations  @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "if the number of receivers is greater than some threshold ( which depends uniquely on the channel and the number of channel uses ) , we show that entanglement does not help .",
    "however , for any constant number of receivers , we can build a compound channel ( based on a family studied in @xcite ) for which there is a separation between the entanglement - assisted and classical setting ( corollary  [ cor : compound ] ) .    in the second problem ,",
    "multiple senders cooperate to communicate with a single receiver through identical classical channels .",
    "our theorem  [ thm : sep_c_l ] shows that there exist channels for which entanglement increases the amount of communication that can be sent , independently from the number of senders .",
    "more surprisingly , there are channels for which entanglement allows a joint strategy among the senders that is strictly better than the sum of the individual strategies ( theorem  [ thm : disjointalpha ] ) .",
    "if each sender is able to transmit @xmath0 messages using entanglement , there is a joint entanglement - assisted strategy for @xmath1 senders that allows to communicate strictly more than @xmath2 messages .",
