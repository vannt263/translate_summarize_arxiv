    "the gluon condensate @xmath4 with @xmath5 the gluon field strength tensor , was introduced in qcd in the framework of the short - distance operator product expansion applied to the two - point correlation function of heavy and light quark current operators @xcite .",
    "it represents the vacuum matrix element of the lowest dimensional gauge - invariant operator constructed by gluon fields , and parametrizes the long - wavelength fluctuations of the color fields in the nonperturbative qcd vacuum .",
    "it typically appears in qcd sum rule analyses , and its value has been determined in a phenomenological way , mainly on the basis of information on the spectrum of heavy quarkonium .",
    "estimates have also been obtained using the dilute instanton - gas approximation @xcite ; the favoured numerical value @xmath6 gev@xmath7 is affected by a large uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the gluon condensate is related to the qcd trace anomaly which , for massless quarks , reads @xmath8 @xmath9 being the trace of the qcd energy momentum tensor , @xmath10 the t hooft coupling ( @xmath11 is the number of colors ) , and @xmath12 the @xmath13-function of qcd .",
    "hence , the vacuum value of the trace of the qcd energy momentum tensor is connected to ( [ gc ] ) .",
    "determinations of the gluon condensate can be obtained in lattice qcd @xcite . in this case , the condensate is derived from small wilson loops , after subtracting a perturbative tail in the lattice coupling constant expansion , whose first coefficients are either analytically computed or fitted to the numerical results . the wilson loop method can be easily extended to finite temperature . in particular , simulations in full qcd show that the temperature dependence of the gluon condensate across the deconfinement transition is different for the ( chromo ) magnetic and electric components : the magnetic condensate is quite independent of t , while the electric condensate decreases as temperature increases @xcite . numerical information about the chemical potential dependence is not available , at present .    hence , the gluon condensate reflects relevant features of the strongly coupled color fields in the qcd vacuum .",
    "although it can not be identified as an order parameter in any qcd phase transition , it is an important quantity to examine when temperature and baryon density are changed .",
    "the holographic approach is a suitable method for such a monitoring , in particular in models in which the behavior of the quark condensate vs temperature and baryon density can also be studied @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the qcd transition between a chirally symmetric phase and a phase with broken chiral symmetry can be analyzed in the same framework as the deconfinement transition . in lattice simulations , at vanishing chemical potential , the two transitions occur close to each other .",

    "the holographic determination of the gluon condensate is useful to gain information about these aspects of qcd .",

    "we analyze the condensate ( [ gc ] ) in a holographic model of qcd described in section [ sec : model ] . in section [ sec : freen ] we use the free energy to determine the gluon condensate dependence on temperature and baryon density , while in section [ sec : wloop ] we use the small temporal and spatial wilson loops to study the low-@xmath1 behaviour of the ( chromo ) electric and magnetic contributions to the gluon condensate .",
