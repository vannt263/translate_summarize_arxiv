    "dynamics of open quantum systems has been extensively studied in the last decades due to its pivotal importance in the areas of quantum optics , quantum dissipative dynamics and quantum information @xcite .",
    "the lindblad master equations under the born - markov approximations are the major theoretical tools in depicting quantum evolution under the influence of external noises , but they are doomed to fail when the system - environment coupling becomes strong or when the environment is a structured medium @xcite .",
    "moreover , the widely used rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) ceases to be valid at a strong coupling regime @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear that to correctly explain the novel quantum - mechanical phenomena arising from the strong - coupling physics , the counter - rotating terms neglected in the rwa must be taken into account properly . in addition , the counter - rotating terms are known to be important in understanding quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects @xcite .",
    "all the current researches going beyond the rwa and markov approximation have shown the necessity of developing a powerful approach to dealing with new physics arising from the strong coupling between the open quantum system of interest and its environment @xcite .",
    "a stochastic schrdinger equation named the non - markovian quantum state diffusion ( qsd ) equation derived from a microscopic model has several advantages over the exact master equations . while the exact master equations exist only for a few solvable models ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "[ ] ) , the exact qsd equation has been established for a generic class of quantum open systems @xcite",
    ". however , the applications of the exact qsd equation are severely limited unless this time - nolocal integro - differential equation can be cast into a numerically implementable time - local form @xcite . in the real - world problems , solving the exact dynamical equations in a strong coupling regime is very difficult .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to develop an efficient perturbative method that can be implemented to solve open system dynamics dictated by the strong coupling and structured medium .    in this paper , we develop a systematic and efficient approach to solving the non - markovian qsd equations for open quantum systems up to arbitrary orders of noises . the major breakthrough is to convert the non - markovian qsd equation into a set of coupled stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sode s ) which efficiently evaluates a series expansion of the previously unsolvable @xmath0-operator up to arbitrarily high orders .",
    "the method can be generally applied to an arbitrary finite - state open system coupled to a bosonic bath with a lorentzian noise spectrum at zero temperature . as an important example",
    ", our method is used to solve a spin - boson model with a lorentzian environment at zero temperature in the strong coupling regime that is previously intractable when real - time quantum dynamics is needed .",
    "to put our discussion into perspective , we first consider a generic open quantum system with the following hamiltonian ( setting @xmath1)@xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian of the system under consideration , @xmath4 is the lindblad operator , and @xmath5 denotes the annihilation operator of the @xmath6th mode of the bosonic bath .",
    "the state of the bath may be specified by a set of complex numbers @xmath7 labeling the ( bargmann ) coherent states of all modes .",
    "the function @xmath8 that characterizes time - dependent states of the bath may be defined by the fourier expansion @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath10 is interpreted as a gaussian random variable , then @xmath8 becomes a gaussian process with the correlation function obtained by the statistical mean @xmath11 .",
    "for the simple case with a zero - temperature bath , the system state at time @xmath12 obtained from projecting the total state to the bath state @xmath13 , @xmath14 , which is called a quantum trajectory , obeys a linear qsd equation @xcite @xmath15 here , the @xmath0-operator is defined by @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . evaluating the @xmath0 operator poses a major challenge in solving quantum open systems in real - world applications .",
    "it is remarkable that the evolution is completely decoupled from projections to other bath states and hence can be solved independently . in practice",
    ", one may adopt an importance sampling scheme in which the normalized system state @xmath18 is governed by the norm - conserving nonlinear qsd equation @xcite , @xmath19\\tilde{\\psi}_t , \\label{eq : nonlinearsse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we define a shifted noise as @xmath23 , where the shift @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 , and @xmath26 the state of the open quantum system at @xmath12 , represented by the reduced density matrix @xmath27 , can be recovered from an ensemble average @xmath28 . the qsd equations ( [ eq : linearsse ] ) and ( [ eq : nonlinearsse ] ) are exact .",
    "a key challenge is the determination of the @xmath0 operator contained in these equations . for most practical problems except for a few specific examples where the exact @xmath0 may be explicitly determined @xcite ,",
    "one has to resort to a functional expansion @xcite in terms of @xmath29 which after adapting to @xmath30 writes @xmath31where @xmath32 is symmetric with respect to the time variables @xmath33 .",
    "however , finding @xmath34 and performing the integrations for higher order terms are formidable tasks and have only been performed up to @xmath35 for some specific models @xcite .",
    "in this work , we show that the qsd perturbation may be carried out to an arbitrary order of noise terms . specifically , we can efficiently evaluate eq .",
    "( [ eq : functional ] ) up to @xmath36 perturbative terms for the spin - boson model under consideration .",
    "we first rewrite it as @xmath37 where @xmath38 nominally but we allow @xmath39 when higher order terms are vanishingly small . we also define a generalized operator , @xmath40for @xmath41 , @xmath42 does not contribute directly to @xmath20 but is an auxiliary operator needed to be solved simultaneously .",
    "let @xmath43 be a mean coupling strength .",

    "( [ eq : q_n_m ] ) , each @xmath42 is a @xmath48-dimensional definite time - integral from 0 to @xmath12 in every dimension . at time @xmath49 , @xmath42 is exactly zero . for sufficiently small @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath42 roughly scales as @xmath50 assuming that the integrand varies smoothly with @xmath12 .",

    "note that a generalization to the finite temperature case is straightforward @xcite .",
    "in particular , for this spin - boson model , the finite - temperature non - markovian qsd equation actually takes the exact same form as the zero - temperature one . an extension to general interaction spectra",
