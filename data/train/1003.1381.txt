    "chern - simons black holes are special solutions of gravity theories in higher than four dimensions which contain higher powers of curvature",
    ". these theories are consistent lanczos - lovelock theories resulting in second order field equations for the metric with well defined ads asymptotic solutions . for",
    "spherically symmetric topologies , these black holes are labelled by an integer @xmath1 which specifies the higher order of curvature present in the lanczos - lovelock action and it is related to the dimensionality @xmath2 of spacetime by the relation @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "these solutions where further generalized to flat and hyperbolic topologies  @xcite .    for spherical topologies",
    "the chern - simons black holes have similar causal structure as the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional btz black hole  @xcite , and they have positive specific heat and therefore thermodynamical stability . for hyperbolic topologies , the chern - simons black holes resemble to the topological black holes  @xcite in their zero mass limit , and their thermodynamic behaviour was studied in  @xcite .",
    "an illustrative example of chern - simons black holes is provided by the gauss - bonnet theory for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "static local solutions of this theory are well studied over the years  @xcite .",
    "this theory has two branches of solutions .",
    "if there is a fine tuning between @xmath1 and the gauss - bonnet coupling constant @xmath6 , the two solutions coincide to the chern - simons black hole solution which has maximum symmetry .",
    "this is known as the chern - simons limit ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "the stability of these solutions has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "it was found in  @xcite that one of these solutions suffers from ghost - like instability up to the strongly coupled chern - simons limit where linear perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "therefore , to study the stability at the exact chern - simons limit we have to go beyond perturbation theory . it was speculated in  @xcite that chern - simons black holes could be a transitional configuration between the two branches of solutions .    in this work",
    "we will consider a matter distribution outside the horizon of a chern - simons black hole with hyperbolic topology parameterized by a scalar field .",
    "we will perturb the scalar field assuming that there is no back reaction on the metric .",
    "this will result in the calculation of the quasi - normal modes ( qnms ) which are characterized by a spectrum that is independent of the initial conditions of the perturbation and depends only on the black hole parameters and on the fundamental constants of the system ( for a recent review see  @xcite ) .",
    "a novel and interesting feature of our calculation is that the qnms of the chern - simons black holes depend also on the curvature parameter @xmath1 .",
    "as we will discuss , because of the presence of the curvature parameter @xmath1 as we approach the chern - simons limit the curvature singularity becomes milder .",
    "this may give detectable signature through the qnms in the gravitational waves experiments .",
    "another interesting feature of the qnms is their connection to thermal conformal field theories .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , classical gravity backgrounds in ads space are dual to conformal field theories at the boundary ( for a review see  @xcite ) . using this principle",
    "it was established  @xcite that the relaxation time of a thermal state of the boundary thermal theory is proportional to the inverse of the imaginary part of the qnms of the dual gravity background .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the qnms spectrum determines how fast a thermal state in the boundary theory will reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "we will show that , the rate at which a scalar field in the background of a chern - simons black hole will decay or the rate the boundary thermal theory will reach thermal equilibrium , depends on the value of the curvature parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the qnms were also studied in relation to the quantum area spectrum of the black hole horizon .",
    "bekenstein @xcite was the first who proposed the idea that in quantum gravity the area of black hole horizon is quantized leading to a discrete spectrum which is evenly spaced .",
    "an interesting proposal was made by hod  @xcite who conjectured that the asymptotic qnm frequency is related to the quantized black hole area .",
    "the black hole spectrum can be obtained imposing the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition to an adiabatic invariant quantity involving the energy @xmath7 and the vibrational frequency @xmath8  @xcite . identifying @xmath8 with the real part @xmath9 of the qnms",
    ", the hod s conjecture leads to an expression of the quantized black hole area , which however is not universal for all black hole backgrounds .",
    "furthermore it was argued  @xcite , that in the large damping limit the identification of @xmath8 with the imaginary part of the qnms could lead to the bekenstein universal bound  @xcite .",
    "both approaches have been followed in the literature  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will calculate the area spectrum and the mass spectrum of a chern - simons black hole with hyperbolic topology .",
    "we will show that there is a strong dependence of the spectrums on the hyperbolic geometry and that they are not evenly spaced .",
    "the knowledge of black holes perturbations is also useful in studying the hawking radiation .",
    "the hawking radiation is a semiclassical effect and it gives the thermal radiation emitted by a black hole .",
    "however , black holes do not radiate strictly blackbody type radiation due to the well known frequency dependent greybody factors .",
    "these factors arise from frequency - dependent potential barriers outside the horizon which filter the initially blackbody spectrum emanating from the horizon @xcite . in asymptotically ads spacetimes",
    ", the light rays can reach spatial infinity and return to the origin in finite time .",
    "black holes in this kind of spacetimes are in thermal equilibrium with their environment .",
    "so , the radiation produced at black hole horizon is all re - absorbed and the radiation which reaches spatial infinity is reflected back , with part of this radiation travelling all the way through to the black hole horizon , and the rest being reflected back to spatial infinity @xcite .    in the present work , the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the greybody factors of chern - simons black holes are computed analytically .",
    "we make a numerical analysis of their behaviour in five - dimensions and in the low frequency limit and we found that contrary to the schwarzschild - ads case there is a range of modes with high angular momentum which contributes to the absorption cross section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief review of the chern - simons theory . in sec .",
    "iii we calculate the exact qnms of the scalar perturbations of d - dimensional chern - simons black holes with hyperbolic topology . in sec .",
    "iv using the calculated qnms , the mass and area spectrum of chern - simons black holes are presented . in sec .",
    "v we calculate the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the greybody factors of chern - simons black holes . finally , our conclusions are in sec .",
    "the einstein tensor is the only symmetric and conserved tensor depending on the metric and its derivatives , which is linear in the second derivatives of the metric .",
    "the field equations arise from the einstein - hilbert action with a cosmological constant @xmath10 . in higher dimensions , the potential problem is to find the most general action that gives rise to a set of second order field equations .",
    "the solution to this problems is the lanczos - lovelock ( ll ) action @xcite .",
    "this action is non linear in the riemann tensor and differs from the einstein - hilbert action only if the spacetime has more than @xmath11 dimensions .",
    "therefore , the lanczos - lovelock action is the most natural extension of general relativity in higher dimensional spacetimes . in @xmath0dimensions",
    "it can be written as follow @xmath12with @xmath13where @xmath14 and @xmath15 stand for the vielbein and the curvature two - form respectively and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are related to the gravitational constant @xmath18 and the cosmological constant @xmath10 through @xmath19@xmath20and @xmath21 where @xmath22 for @xmath23 and vanishes for @xmath24 , with @xmath25 $ ] ( @xmath26 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 corresponds to the volume of a unit @xmath29-dimensional sphere .",

    "if @xmath3 , the solutions are known as chern - simons black holes ( for a review on the chern - simons theories see @xcite ) .",
    "these solutions were further generalized to other topologies  @xcite and they can be described in general by a non - trivial transverse spatial section @xmath30 of @xmath29-dimensions labelled by the constant @xmath31 that represents the curvature of the transverse section , corresponding to a spherical , hyperbolic or plane section respectively .",

    "we are merely interested here for the hyperbolic topology with @xmath41 .",

    "chern - simons black holes are very interesting static solutions of gravity theories which asymptotically approach spacetimes of constant negative curvature ( ads spacetimes ) .",

    "the specific heat of these black holes is positive and therefore they can always reach thermal equilibrium with their surroundings and hence , are stable against thermal fluctuations .",
    "these theories of high curvature also admit solutions which represent black objects of other topologies , whose singularity is surrounded by horizons of non - spherical topology . in the case of hyperbolic topology , introducing a discrete symmetry group and making the right identifications the resulting black holes resemble the topological black holes .",

    "it is interesting one to study the possibility of the existence of a phase transition as it happens in the case of the topological black holes  @xcite .    in this work we calculated the qnms of scalar perturbations of the chern - simons black holes with hyperbolic topology .",
    "we found that the qnms depend on the highest power of curvature present in the lanczos - lovelock theories .",
    "we also calculated the mass and area spectrum of these black holes .",
