    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are dynamic solar phenomena in which mass and magnetic field are ejected from the lower corona into the higher solar atmosphere and interplanetary space .",
    "they involve large scale changes to the coronal structure and reconfiguration of the coronal magnetic field .",
    "a commonly used definition of cmes describes them as new , discrete , bright features appearing in the field of view of a white light coronagraph and moving outward over a period of minutes to hours ( e.g. munro et al . , 1979 ) . on the basis of this broad definition",
    "several classifications were introduced .",
    "the morphology and spectral characteristics of cmes were extensively studied over the last decade ( e.g. hundhausen 1997 ; st .",
    "cyr et al . 2000 ; antonucci et al .",
    "1997 ; ciaravella et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 , 2001 ) .",
    "apparent angular widths of the cmes cover a wide range from few to 360 degrees ( howard et al .",
    "1985 ; st .",
    "cyr et al . 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "the very narrow structures ( narrower than about @xmath5 ) form only a small subset of all the observed cmes and are usually referred to as rays , spikes , fans , etc .",
    "( munro & sime 1985 ; howard et al . 1985 )",
    ".    recently , gilbert et al . (",
    "2001 ) conducted a study of 15 selected narrow cmes observed in white light by the large angle spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) aboard _ solar and heliospheric observatory _",
    "( _ soho _ ) in the period from 1999 march through december .",
    "the selection criteria included the condition that the measurable angular width of the event is no more than @xmath6 and the cme is not part of a larger event .",
    "moreover , the cmes had to have a clear surface association in h@xmath1 and/or data from the mauna loa solar observatory ( mlso ) , or in data from the extreme ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ) on _ soho_. gilbert et al .",
    "( 2001 ) examined the events structures , angular sizes and projected radial velocities within the lasco c2 and c3 coronagraphs field of view ( @xmath7 ) , and likely surface associations .",
    "the narrow cmes appeared to fall into two categories : `` structured '' , that exhibit well defined interior features in the lasco images ( 7 events ) and `` unstructured '' , that were featureless ( 8 events ) . in their exploratory study they did not find any obvious difference between narrow and large cmes other than their appearance .",
    "the projected average radial velocities of the narrow cmes ( @xmath8  km  s@xmath9 ) are similar to the average speed of the regular cmes .",
    "the solar corona manifests its activity in various ways .",
    "besides cmes , another type of eruptive event observed throughout the whole solar cycle is coronal jets .",
    "they are presumably triggered by field reconnection between a magnetic dipole and neighboring unipolar region ( wang et al .",
    "different types of coronal jets were observed by various instruments : the _ yohkoh _ soft x  ray telescope ( sxt ) ( shibata et al . 1992 ) and _ soho _ ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ) , eit , and lasco ( moses et al .",

    "the jets originate in a variety of settings ; in uv and x - ray bright points within coronal holes , in active regions , flares , etc . in the white light",
    "coronagraphs they appear as narrow , fast and featureless , bright structures ( howard et al .",
    "they are often listed among cmes as they satisfy the general cme definition .    according to the most popular models , coronal jets and cmes",
    "are entirely different phenomena .",
    "a jet is taken to be the result of reconnection between open and closed field lines in which the gas may be strongly heated ( x  ray jet ) , and it is accelerated by the magnetic tension force of the newly reconnected field lines ( shibata et al .",
    "1992 ; shimojo et al .",
    "cmes , on the other hand , are attributed to the release of magnetic stress stored in a twisted flux rope ( e.g. amari et al .",
    "2000 ; gibson & low 1998 ; lin & forbes 2000 ) or in a sheared arcade held down by overlying unsheared field ( antiochos , devore , & klimchuk 1999 ) .",
    "in this project we study spectra of the narrow cmes as they may shed some light on differences between narrow and large cmes and , in particular , the relation of the narrow cmes to coronal jets .",

    "( 2001 ) . in 1999 , each uvcs daily observing plan consisted of a 14 hour standard synoptic sequence and special observations designed by the lead observer . during the synoptic observations",
    "the slits were scanned radially at eight position angles ( p.a . ; measured counterclockwise from the north heliographic pole ) @xmath14 apart at different heights ranging from @xmath10 up to @xmath15 .",
    "uvcs had a chance to record the cme spectrum only when its pointing coincided with the event .",
    "this happened on five occasions out of fifteen listed by gilbert et al .",
    "most of the observations appeared as a part of the synoptic sequence . during the synoptic scans the instrument configuration included an entrance slit of 100  for the channel corresponding to 28  or 0.4   .",
    "the spatial binning was 3 pixels ( 21  ) , and the grating position covered three spectral ranges : 1023.201043.75 , 1208.721220.62 ( with ly@xmath1 from the redundant mirror ) , 975.78979.16  , with spectral binnings of 3 , 2 , and 2 pixels ( 0.298 , 0.183 , and 0.183  ) respectively .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath16  s. unfortunately , the synoptic program provides fairly short dwell times at each height , making it difficult to characterize time dependence of the events .",
    "we obtained ultraviolet spectra of five narrow cmes reported by gilbert et al .",
    "the events on 1999 march 27 and april 15 were described as structured and events on 1999 may 9 , 21 , and 1999 june 3 as unstructured .",

    "the grating and detector mask covered four spectral ranges : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27   , which allowed us to monitor the emission lines ly@xmath1 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 in second order , and others .",

    "brightening of the ly@xmath1 and both @xmath2 lines due to the cme was present at all exposures .",

    "gilbert et al . ( 2001 ) concluded that the cme was associated with a flare in an active region located at the west limb . the sxt image from 02:44 ut shows a bright loop formed at this position .",

    "there is a discrepancy with gilbert et al .",
    "they noted that the cme was centered at p.a.=@xmath66 rather than @xmath65 , however we carefully analyzed the lasco c2 and c3 movies from that period of time and concluded that the cme was really seen a few degrees north of the p.a.=@xmath66 mark .",
    "also the angular width measured with uvcs agrees with lasco estimates , which suggests that it is the same structure .",
    "there were no other ejections in the close vicinity .",
    "we compared the cme spectra with corresponding synoptic observations obtained a day later an 1999 june 04 between 09:03 ut and 11:18 ut .",
    "synoptic data acquired a day earlier contained some transient features so we could not use them . at @xmath64 , away from the cme position , the integrated intensities of the brighter emission lines agreed with those in the cme spectra within @xmath67% . with respect to the post  cme data the passage of the cme caused @xmath68% enhancement of the integrated intensities of @xmath51 and 12% increase in the ly@xmath1 intensities .",
    "the line ratio decreased from 3.3 to 2.6 .",
    "we did not see any significant changes in the @xmath18 widths of the profiles .",
    "however , the lines were relatively weak so high in the corona and the profiles were heavily binned in the spectral direction ( @xmath69 ) , which prevented us from measuring the @xmath18 widths accurately .",
    "gilbert et al . ( 2001 ) found that this cme was likely lifted up from a surface in the area without a preexisting structure and they classified this event as a `` surge '' . at 05:53 ut sxt observed a faint jet  like structure on the east limb .",
    "later , at 07:31 ut the brightness increased in this area that appeared to be connected to the nearby active region by faint jet  like features .",
    "uvcs recorded five out of 15 narrow cmes selected by gilbert et al .",
    "two of them were structured , i.e. in white light data they exhibited well defined interior features , and three unstructured , i.e. appeared featureless . in our studies we relied on the archival uvcs data obtained when the instrument pointing coincided with occurrence of the cme . whenever uvcs was pointing in the right direction at the right time ,",
    "the cme was recorded as a brightening of the strongest emission lines . in most cases",
    "the configuration of the instrument and type of uvcs observations was not ideal for a cme  watch campaign , e.g. , heavy binning in the spectral direction for the lines , short time coverage at each height , etc .",
    "the narrow cmes appear to be associated with disk activity that lasted up to several hours . in the lasco c2 field of view",
    "they were visible for an extended period of time of about @xmath70 hour .",
    "from the time of first appearance in c2 , estimated speeds and recorded beginnings for some events we were able to reconstruct the timeline of the considered cmes assuming constant velocity .",
    "we found that in all events the uvcs observations at each height began from 10 minutes to about an hour after the passage of the cme leading edge .",
    "thus , in most cases uvcs recorded only the trailing parts of the cme .",
    "also at different heights uvcs most likely probed different parts of the cme .",
    "we obtained lasco c2 mass estimates for most of the events .",
    "they were derived from the brightness enhancement in white light data due to the cme after subtracting a pre  event image .",
    "the number of coronal electrons needed to produce the excess brightness was calculated assuming thompson scattering of photospheric light .",
    "the mass was then computed assuming a neutral atmosphere consisting of ionized hydrogen and 10% helium ( for a more comprehensive discussion of mass calculations with lasco , see vourlidas et al .",
    "we assumed that all of the material contributing to the excess mass lies in the plane of the sky , which is consistent with mostly negligible blue and redshifts of their profiles . to derive the density we assumed that the narrow cmes can be approximated with a cylindrical geometry within the lasco c2 field of view .",
    "the length of the cylinder was determined from the radial length of the cme in c2 images and a width consistent with the observed angular size .",
    "this approach assumes that the density of material in the structure is uniform , which is likely an oversimplification .",
    "as each narrow cme was visible in lasco c2 field of view for about an hour , several images were taken at this period of time .",
    "we derived mass and density estimates for all the frames containing the cme structure and adopted an average value .",
    "table  3 lists the derived densities , the average height the structure appeared at and the observed width .",
    "wang & sheeley ( 2002 ) examined a number of jetlike events observed with lasco during the current sunspot maximum .",
    "they appear to be similar to the narrow cmes  their angular widths are @xmath71 and have clear surface association visible in the eit @xmath49 data .",
    "many of the ejections originated from active regions located inside or near the boundaries of nonpolar coronal holes . based on that wang & sheeley concluded that the jet  producing regions consist of systems of closed magnetic loops and adjacent open flux .",
    "perturbation in the closed field would cause the lines to reconnect with the overlying open flux , releasing the trapped energy in the form of a jetlike ejection .",
    "we examined the @xmath72 spectroheliograms and @xmath73 magnetograms obtained by the national solar observatory vacum telescope at kitt peak as well as magnetograms taken with the _ soho _ michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) corresponding to ejections in our sample . in the events on may 9 and may 21 there was a nonpolar coronal hole located close to the active region that was presumably associated with the narrow cme . on march 27 and",
    "june 6 there were small coronal holes within @xmath74 of latitude from what was interpreted as footpoints of the cme .",
    "there was no obvious coronal hole present close to the source of the april 15 ejection .    to model narrow cme plasma conditions we used a time ",
    "independent spectral line synthesis model based on the code developed by cranmer et al .",
    "the model describes the narrow cme as a flux tube located in the plain of the sky , which is consistent with the lack of significant doppler shifts of the emission lines ( see also dobrzycka et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ) .",
    "there is no line  of  sight contribution from the background and foreground corona taken into account .",
    "the goal of the model is to reproduce the cme emission from table  2 where the ambient corona is already subtracted .",
    "the cme flux tube is defined at each height to have the observed angular width , and the electron density ( @xmath75 ) , outflow speed , electron temperature ( @xmath76 ) , and ion temperature ( parallel , @xmath77 , and perpendicular , @xmath78 , to the radial directed field ) are modeled .",
    "we chose to model the best observed examples of structured ( april 15 ) and unstructured ( may 09 ) narrow cmes .",
    "there were several observational parameters to fit at several projected heights ; the ly@xmath1 and intensities , the @xmath18 widths of the ly@xmath1 and profiles as well as the @xmath2 line ratio .      in our analysis of this event we concentrated on two heights : @xmath79 and @xmath46 .",
    "gilbert et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimated that the leading edge or points close to the front of this cme moved with constant velocity of 523  km  s@xmath9 . they were unable to identify acceleration or deceleration in this event . however , independent analysis of the trajectory in the field of view of lasco s c2 and c3 , available in the cspsw / nrl _ soho_/lasco cme catalog clearly revealed acceleration .",
    "the @xmath80 line ratio is a good indicator of the plasma outflow velocity ( see e.g. withbroe et al .",

    "figure  2 shows the model @xmath80 line ratios computed for the 1999 april 15 event at @xmath81 and @xmath46 for different values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "three sets of @xmath75 values were chosen to correspond to : ( 1 ) the background coronal hole ( guhathakurta & holzer 1994 ) , ( 2 ) the background streamer ( guhathakurta & fisher 1995 ) , and ( 3 ) a density several times of that of the streamer .",
    "the model predictions are overplotted with the observed ratios ( 1.9 at @xmath79 and 2.2 at @xmath46 ) that have relatively large uncertainties due to uncertain post  cme background subtraction and the line intensity variations from exposure to exposure .",
    "figure  2 demonstrates that if the electron density is comparable to or higher than the streamer background corona we can not identify a unique value for the cme outflow velocity from the ratio alone .    at @xmath79 uvcs",
    "recorded strong relative brightening of the emission lines and only weak brightening of the ly@xmath1 ( table  2 ) .",
    "it suggests that the ly@xmath1 enhancement was most likely reduced due to doppler dimming .",
    "doppler dimming arises from a doppler shift between the incident chromospheric radiation and the moving coronal gas .",
    "the faster the gas moves , the larger the doppler shift of its absorption profile , and thus fewer photons are scattered to form the emission line .",
    "doppler dimming affects only the resonantly scattered part of the line .",
