    "titan exhibits a rich interior structure due to its large mean radius of 2575 kilometers .",
    "the recent measurements of the gravity field by @xcite reveal that titan s moment of inertia ( moi ) is as low as @xmath5 .",
    "a large panel of internal structures , made of a low density core surrounded by icy layers , are consistent with this range of moi and the mean density value of @xmath6 kg m@xmath7 deduced by @xcite .",
    "in addition , the presence of a global internal ocean has been suggested from several techniques .",
    "first , @xcite deduced the putative internal ocean through the response of the rotational motion of the surface to the atmospheric coupling . a second piece of evidence has been obtained from the determination of the non - zero obliquity by @xcite from the radar images of cassini .",
    "they determined an obliquity equal to 0.3 degree that is larger than the @xmath8 degree obtained for a rigid titan in a cassini state ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "then @xcite and @xcite suggested that this deviation is related to the influence of an internal ocean on the obliquity .",
    "additional arguments in favor of this internal ocean have been obtained by electrical @xcite , topographical @xcite and gravitational @xcite analyses of titan from cassini - huygens data .",
    "titan s rotational motion has been measured by @xcite that used the cassini spacecraft s radar images in order to follow landmarks at the surface .",
    "they obtained a near - synchronous rotation for titan with a drift rate of @xmath9 degree per day , _ i.e. _ @xmath10 degree per year @xcite .",
    "this approach has been recently revisited by @xcite that determined a synchronous spin - orbit motion within a residual of about 0.02 degree per year .",
    "the main advantage of their approach is the introduction of titan s librational motion in the reduction process .",
    "the librations describe the oscillations around the uniform rotational motion . here",
    "we focus on the librations in longitude that correspond to the oscillations of the body principal axis projected onto the equatorial plane of the satellite . in the case of titan",
    ", they have two distinct origins .",
    "the first one comes from the gravitational torque exerted by saturn on the dynamical figure of titan .",
    "the second one results from the coupling between the surface and the dense atmosphere of titan , the atmospheric torque .",
    "their amplitudes are modified by the interior parameters of titan .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the elastic behavior of the icy shell is not negligible and may strongly reduce the librational motion .",
    "such prediction has been confirmed by @xcite that computed the libration in longitude at the orbital frequency of titan . in that case",
    ", titan s surface will deform instead of rotate since the ocean figure should always point toward the planet and exert an elastic torque on the icy shell .",
    "the objective of this paper is to determine the librational reponse of an elastic titan at various forcing frequencies resulting from its orbital motion . by including the atmospheric coupling , we want to decorrelate surface forcing from the internal geophysical properties related to the internal ocean and perturbation of titan s orbit .",
    "we investigate the wide spectrum of titan s librations on contrary to @xcite that focused on the diurnal frequency ( titan s orbital frequency ) and its harmonics , and on the saturnian semi - annual frequency ( twice saturn s orbital frequency ) for the atmospheric coupling .",
    "the main interest is that in the orbital motion , there are librations at the saturnian semi - annual frequency that comes from the interaction of saturn with the sun .",
    "such librations have the same frequency than the main component of the atmospheric torque . in addition , the orbital frequency spectrum can be in , or close to , resonance with some proper frequencies as shown for the galilean satellites @xcite . finally , the periodic variation of the gravitational torque amplitude at orbital frequency provides long - period terms in the libration with amplitudes dependent on the interior model .    in this paper , the recent interior models of titan are also used ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) in order to compute the values of the proper frequencies and to discuss the differences in the amplitude of librations .",
    "the elasticity is investigated by computing the radial deformations of surfaces due to the tides and responsible for the gravitational torques amplitude variations .",
    "finally , we use the 3d atmospheric model from @xcite that predicts an atmospheric torque smaller than in the @xcite paper used in all previous studies @xcite .    in the first part of the paper ,",
    "the internal structure models selected for the librational computation are described .",
    "the properties of these models depend on the history and energy sources of titan ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we selected a broad range of possible internal scenarios for titan in order to characterize the impact of the geophysical parameters on the librations .",
    "the atmospheric torques of @xcite ( called here ch12 ) and of @xcite ( called here to05 ) are described and discussed in sect .",
    "the orbit of titan is then analyzed in sect .",
    "3 by using the frequency analysis method providing the spectrum of the orbital motion . in sect .",
    "4 , the elasticity is introduced in the librational equations through periodic torques amplitudes and the librations are analytically determined for the rigid and elastic cases .",
    "finally , the behavior of the libration angle at different forcing frequency ranges is analyzed and the influence of the geophysical parameters of the different interior models is discussed in sect .",
    "titan s internal structure has been revealed by accurately tracking the trajectory of cassini spacecraft approaching titan during six flybys @xcite .",
    "they measured the gravity field and its variations allowing to infer information on the density profile of the satellite .",
    "since the inversion between the gravity field and density profile is not unique , only a range of models can be determined .",
    "the add - on assumption that titan is close to the hydrostatic equilibrium led @xcite to obtain an estimation of the moment of inertia ( moi ) @xmath11 of titan between @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass and mean radius of titan , respectively ) .",
    "such small moi implies an increase of density towards titan s center and requires a low - density core to match the mean density of @xmath6 kg m@xmath7 @xcite .    in parallel to these gravity measurements ,",
    "two categories of thermal and chemical models have been developed to determine titan s internal structure ( _ e.g. _ @xcite and see the review of @xcite ) . in the first category , as developed by @xcite , the models described essentially the upper layers ( dense and light ocean , comparison of solid models with pure water ice or methane clathrate layers ) , while in the second category the models focused on the inner core composition assuming the presence of a global ocean layer ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite built interior models made of anhydrous silicate core surrounded by hydrated rock and water ice while @xcite focused on hydrated silicates surrounded by mixture of rock and ice .",
    "these models of inner core allow the presence of a small iron core , and are compatible with an internal ocean as deduced by @xcite .",
    "six different models reported in table [ table1 ] have been selected , coming from @xcite ( the models called f1 , f2 and the solid model f3 ) , @xcite ( models ca10 and fe10 ) and @xcite ( model mc11 ) .",
    "the fe10 model is similar to the ca10 model with an additional small inner iron core as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the icy shell thickness has been taken equal to @xmath16 kilometers for each model .",
    "such value corresponds to the upper bound obtained by topographical model of @xcite .",
    "the lower bound has been obtained by @xcite by using the schumann s resonance in titan s atmosphere .",
    "the icy shell thickness is an essential parameter for titan s models with a rigid shell @xcite but the elasticity strongly diminish its influence ( see section [ sec : libration ] ) .",
    "@xcite used oceans with a bottom mean radius of @xmath17 kilometers ( models f1 and f2 ) . to be able to compare the influence of the ocean density and the inner core structure on the libration , the same ocean bottom mean radius is used for the ca10 , mc11 and fe10 models . for a given set of solid layers sizes and densities , the ocean density",
    "is then adjusted to conserve titan s moi and mass .",

    "titan has a thick atmosphere extending up to 800 km with a surface pressure of nearly 1.5 bars .",
    "exchanges of angular momentum happen between the atmosphere and the surface , producing an atmospheric torque influencing titan s rotation .",
    "the atmosphere dynamic is mainly driven by insolation , which creates a circulation zone called a hadley cell between hotter and cooler regions .",
    "the circulation in titan s troposphere is essentially dominated by one hadley cell extending from one pole to the other . at the equinox",
    ", the circulation reverses with the formation of two hadley cells , and the ascending air zone ( also called the intertropical convergence zone ) moves from one pole to the other .",
    "this reversal produces a seasonal angular momentum exchange with saturn s semi - annual period ( @xmath22 terrestrial days ) and has been suggested as the main torque influencing titan s rotation @xcite . the total atmospheric angular momentum ( aam ) is given by @xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24 km is titan s mean radius , @xmath25 m@xmath26s@xmath27 is titan s surface gravity , @xmath28 is the surface pressure , @xmath29 is the zonal wind speed ( i.e. the horizontal wind speed in the west - east direction and relative to the surface , @xmath29 is positive for eastward wind ) , @xmath30 is the latitude and @xmath31 is the pressure .",
    "the atmospheric torque is then @xmath32    the zonal wind speed of an air parcel in the ascending zone is approximately null due to a strong surface friction .",
    "its angular momentum is conserved during its meridional transport from the ascending zone to the poles .",
    "thus , the aam is maximum at equinoxes ( i.e. when the ascending zone is the farthest from titan s rotation axis ) , and minimum at solstices ( i.e. when the ascending zone is the nearest to titan s rotation axis ) @xcite .",
    "this change corresponds to an exchange of angular momentum with the surface by friction of winds .    the angular momentum exchange , and so the atmospheric torque , depends essentially on the extension of the hadley cell in latitude and altitude @xcite .",
    "all previous studies on titan s non - synchronous rotation @xcite used the atmospheric torque at saturnian semi - annual frequency from the general circulation model ( gcm ) of @xcite ( @xmath33 kg m@xmath19 s@xmath26 ; this torque is called here to05 ) . in this study ,",
    "the atmospheric torque from the titan ipsl gcm ( institut pierre - simon laplace general circulation model ) @xcite is also used .",
    "this model successfully reproduces the winds and the thermal structure observed by cassini and huygens @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that the hadley cell is essentially trapped in the first two kilometers .",
    "this trapping , in addition to a lower latitudinal extension of the cell , reduces the angular momentum exchange by approximately a factor 10 compared to @xcite .",
    "the latitudinal extension of the hadley cell depends a great deal on the thermal inertia of the ground ( _ i.e. _ the ground thermal response to solar heating ) .",
    "its value for titan is unknown , it has been estimated to be around @xmath34 j m@xmath19 s@xmath35 k@xmath27 @xcite and used in @xcite , but the value may be higher .",
    "atmospheric torques have been calculated with a thermal inertia of @xmath36 and @xmath37 j m@xmath19 s@xmath35 k@xmath27 , the last one corresponding to a realistic maximal value . in that case , the saturnian semi - annual frequency component of the titan ipsl gcm torque ( called here ch12 ) is of about @xmath38 kg m@xmath19 s@xmath26 and is reduced to @xmath39 kg m@xmath19 s@xmath26 for a model with a thermal inertia of @xmath37 j m@xmath19 s@xmath35 k@xmath27 . in this study , we focus on the first model providing the largest saturnian semi - annual frequency torque amplitude .",

    "[ atmocompare ] .",
    "many other frequencies than the saturnian semi - annual one appear in the spectrum of the atmospheric torque ch12 .",
    "the most important ones are frequencies corresponding to @xmath40 ( linked to the eccentricity of the orbit of saturn around the sun ) , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( other harmonics from the seasonal cycle ) saturnian year with amplitudes below @xmath43 kg m@xmath19 s@xmath26 .",
    "the other frequencies correspond to atmospheric waves that are either free ( baroclinic waves , kelvin waves , ... ) or forced by the thermal tides and the gravitational tides caused by saturn @xcite .",
    "the free atmospheric waves are very dependent on the model , but their amplitudes appear to be small .",
    "concerning the thermal and gravitational tides , they have a very limited impact on the tropospheric winds and therefore on the exchange of angular momentum with the surface in the model from @xcite .",
    "other effects may influence the atmospheric torque .",
    "@xcite suggested the methane cycle could reduce the amplitude of the torque and produce a small drift while @xcite suggested the presence of mountains could increase the aam a little without changing the torque very much .",
    "these effects remain poorly constrained but should only have a small impact .",
    "the librational motion is the rotational response of titan to the gravitational or atmospheric torques exerted on its dynamical figure .",
    "the gravitational torque depends on the relative distance between titan and saturn and on the true longitude of titan ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the orbital elements are time - dependent and can be approximated by quasi - periodic fourier series resulting from the interaction of titan with saturn , the sun or iapetus @xcite .    here , we develop a linear theory of the librational motion of titan that is approximated in small quantities , the amplitude of libration and the eccentricity .",
    "the orbital motion of titan comes from the jpl @xmath44 ephemerides that contain the last observation from cassini space mission @xcite .",

    "in this paper , the librational response in longitude of titan has been investigated by taking into account the presence of a global ocean , the atmospheric torque , the orbital perturbations and the elasticity of solid layers .",
    "a linearized model has been developped and the amplitudes of libration have been computed and decomposed into responses at different frequencies .",
    "the librational responses can be divided into three regimes depending on the forcing frequencies : the low forcing frequencies at saturnian annual and semi - annual periods , the high forcing frequencies at titan s orbital and semi - orbital periods , and the forcing frequency ranges close to the proper frequencies of the system .    for the forcing at low frequencies , the libration response of the satellite",
    "is dominated by the gravitational torque and the internal structure has a negligible effect . in the high frequency forcing case , the librational response depends on the inertia of the body .",
    "the rigid case presents a large librational response at orbital frequency that is strongly reduced by the introduction of elasticity as stated by @xcite .",
    "they introduced an elastic torque that corresponds to the pressure exerted by the ocean on the deformed icy shell as explained by @xcite in appendix ( a.6 ) . in our approach ,",
    "the expression of the pressure torque is obtained according to the procedure detailed in @xcite .",
    "the terms that result from the pressure torque are represented with a prime as shown in section 4.1 for the rigid case and section 4.2 for the purely non - rigid case .",
    "the pressure torque for the non - rigid case results from the deformation of the shell - ocean interface and it is characterized by the term @xmath326 .",
    "thus physically , the pressure torque @xmath326 and the pressure torque of @xcite have the same origin .",
    "then , the literal comparison of the two expressions is difficult because the two approaches are different .",
    "@xcite assumed that the shell is a massless membrane overlaying a purely fluid body . in our case ,",
    "titan is divided in three layers , a shell of thickness 100 km , an ocean of about 200 km thick , and a solid core and the love numbers formalism is used to compute the elastic deformation .",
    "the internal structure of titan is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the six different interior models selected here ( see table [ table1 ] ) are representative of the main categories of titan s interior models .",
    "the librations computed for each model show that the libration amplitude for oceanic ( @xmath327 m ) or oceanless models ( @xmath328 m ) are of the same order at titan s orbital frequency .",
    "we identify in the librations fourier decomposition two new frequencies resulting from the time - dependent inertia tensor in the external gravitational torque .",
    "the amplitudes of these librations are different for interior models with or without ocean . a reduction from @xmath3 to @xmath329 meters",
    "is obtained for the first term , and from @xmath330 to @xmath331 meters for the second one .",
    "these two long - period terms are interesting because they contain the information on the satellite internal structure .    here ,",
    "icy shell thicknesses of @xmath16 , @xmath332 and @xmath4 kilometers have been investigated with a resulting libration amplitude at orbital frequency of the same order ( @xmath333 , @xmath334 and @xmath335 m , respectively ) . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the sensitivity of librations is less dependent on the ice shell thickness when elasticity of the solid layers is taken into account .",
    "the atmospheric torque ch12 obtained with a recent general circulation model from @xcite presents a saturnian semi - annual component ten times smaller than in the torque to05 from @xcite . at this frequency",
    ", the orbital perturbation induces a large librational response of about @xmath309 meters , and the atmospheric torque to05 contributes for about @xmath336 of the libration amplitude .",
    "the contribution is reduced to a few percent for the atmospheric torque ch12 .",
    "the librational response at saturnian semi - annual frequency contain a small signature of the atmospheric circulation and the inner core inertia as shown in eq.([atmosolution ] ) .",
    "in addition , we found that for a titan containing an internal ocean the elasticity strongly reduces the amplitude of high frequency librations and the resulting amplitude is at the same order as the amplitude for solid titan .",
    "finally we identified two new librations ( with arguments @xmath274 and @xmath275 ) at long period induced by the elasticity that contain a signature of the internal structure of a few ten meters .",
    "it is challenging to distinguish these small amplitudes librations with periods of about 30 and 50 years .",
    "in the solid case , the system ( [ eqlib ] ) reduces to one equation @xmath337 with @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath162 the principal moments of inertia of titan , @xmath85 is the libration angle , @xmath14 the mean anomaly , @xmath45 is the true longitude , @xmath86 is the rotation angle of the satellite s longest axis measured from the line of the ascending node and @xmath338 its initial value , and @xmath89 is the mean motion .    in the solid case ,",
    "the proper frequency and libration amplitude are given by @xmath339 @xmath340 where @xmath114 is the magnitude of the perturbation of frequency @xmath115 .",
    "when @xmath115 is small in front of @xmath260 , the librational response tends towards @xmath114 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the forcing frequency is large in front of the proper frequency , the amplitude of libration is reduced with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "the atmospheric torque induces a librational response on the following form @xmath341 where @xmath342 @xmath343 with @xmath116 the phase of the orbital perturbation and @xmath120 the difference of phase with the atmospheric torque of magnitude @xmath119 .    by including the elasticity , the equation governing the librational dynamics",
    "is changed at second order in eccentricity to @xmath344 where @xmath345 . by decomposing these equations on terms of decreasing amplitude as @xmath346",
    ", we can solve the first equation given by @xmath347 the solution @xmath348 at orbital frequency @xmath89 is then written @xmath349 with @xmath350 .",
    "the solution at second order in eccentricity @xmath58 is given at the frequency @xmath351 and @xmath352 by @xmath353    the external torque exerted on the solid body figure is canceled when the dynamic love number @xmath138 is equal to the fluid love number @xmath354 .",
    "the torque amplitude is given at the orbital frequency by @xmath355 since @xmath356 and @xmath357 we find @xmath358 when @xmath359 . in that case the torque exerted by saturn on the satellite is null since the solid layers are responding to tidal forces as an incompressible fluid .",
    "this behavior is also explained by @xcite by the mean of the love number @xmath360 .",
