    "in this paper we apply the path integration technique recently developed for the statistical sum of the generic time - parametrization invariant gravitational system with the frw metric @xcite to a particular case of the cosmology generated by the conformal field theory ( cft ) with a large number of quantum species .",

    "it is important that this representation is not a minisuperspace approximation , when all the fields @xmath16 are frozen out .",
    "rather this is the disentangling of the collective degrees of freedom from the configuration space , the rest of which effectively manifest itself in terms of this effective action .",

    "were obtained in @xcite as a function of the primordial cosmological constant , whereas the calculational technique for the one - loop prefactor @xmath21 was developed in @xcite .    here",
    "we calculate this prefactor for the set of instantons in a special range of the cosmological constant in which they have a one - fold nature  a single oscillation of the scale factor @xmath10 between its minimal and maximal values . in sect.2",
    "we give the description of the full set of instanton solutions of @xcite and compare them with those of @xcite  the paper which also considers trace anomaly driven cosmology but differs from our work by setting the problem and the choice of the field - theoretical model .",
    "then after a brief formulation of the calculational method of @xcite in sect.3 we calculate the one - loop prefactor @xmath21 in sect.4 . there we begin with the description of the above mentioned set of one - fold instantons and their various characteristics and then estimate the magnitude of @xmath21 for quantum fields of various spins .",
    "the paper is accomplished with concluding remarks in conclusions .",
    "in the theory with a primordial cosmological constant @xmath22 and a large number of free ( linear ) fields @xmath3 conformally coupled to gravity  conformal field theory ( cft ) , @xmath23=      -\\frac1{16\\pi g }      \\int d^4x\\ ,      g^{1/2}\\,\\big(r      -2\\lambda\\big ) + s_{cft}[\\,g_{\\mu\\nu},\\phi\\ , ] ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effective action @xmath24 $ ] is dominated by the contribution of these fields because they simply outnumber the non - conformal fields including , in particular , the graviton .",
    "then this quantum effective action is exactly calculable as a _ functional _ of histories @xmath25 by the conformal transformation converting ( [ frw ] ) into the static ( einstein universe ) metric with @xmath26 @xcite .",

    "the effective lagrangian of its local part @xmath30 includes the classical einstein term with the renormalized planck mass @xmath31 and the cosmological constant @xmath32 and contains also the contribution of the conformal anomaly of quantum fields and their vacuum ( casimir ) energy , @xmath33 the constant @xmath34 is determined by the coefficient of the gauss - bonnet term in the overall conformal anomaly of all cft fields @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a nonlocal part of the action @xmath35 is the free energy of their quasi - equilibrium excitations with the temperature given by the inverse of the conformal time ( [ eta ] ) .",
    "this is a typical boson or fermion sum over field oscillators with energies @xmath36 on a unit 3-sphere .",
    "semiclassically the integral ( [ 1 ] ) is dominated by the saddle points  solutions of the effective friedmann equation of the _ euclidean _ gravity theory @xmath37 modified by the quantum @xmath38-term and the radiation term @xmath39 .",
    "the constant @xmath40 here characterizes the sum of the renormalized casimir energy @xmath41 and the energy of the gas of thermally excited particles @xmath42 thus , the amount of thermal radiation in this self - consistent back reaction problem is not put by hands , but determined by the _ bootstrap _ equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) which yields @xmath40 as a functional of the frw geometry in which this radiation evolves .",
    "the inverse temperature @xmath43  the instanton period in units of the conformal time  is given by the integral ( [ eta ] ) over the full period of @xmath4 or the @xmath44-multiple of the integral between the two neighboring turning points of the scale factor history @xmath10 , @xmath45 .",
    "this @xmath46-fold nature implies that in the background solution during the full period of its euclidean time the scale factor oscillates @xmath46 times between its maximum and minimum values @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and forms a kind of a garland of @xmath5 topology with oscillating @xmath0 sections . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "these garland - type instantons exist only in the limited range of the cosmological constant @xmath32 , @xmath50 and are weighted in the relevant statistical ensemble by their exponentiated on - shell action according to ( [ z ] ) , where @xmath20 $ ] is taken at the solution of eqs.([efeq])-([bootstrap ] ) .",
    "in particular , a set of instantons with @xmath51  a single oscillation of the scale factor @xmath10 between its minimal and maximal values ( [ apm ] )  occupies a certain continuous range of @xmath52 inside @xmath53 $ ] adjacent to its lower boundary @xcite .    the main effect of these exponential weights is a complete suppression of another set of solutions  the vacuum hartle - hawking instantons @xcite with no radiation @xmath54 , which represent the euclidean de sitter spacetime .",
    "these purely vacuum contributions are ruled out by their infinite _ positive _ effective action ( cf .",
    "@xmath55-factor in the kinetic @xmath38-terms of the effective action ( [ effaction ] ) which render its integrand diverging to @xmath56 at @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 )",
    ". otherwise , these exponential weights are of the same order of magnitude and they are inefficient to select most probable configurations .",
    "this makes important the calculation of the one - loop prefactor @xmath21 which is the main focus of this paper .",
    "the technique for this prefactor was developed for a parametrization invariant system ( [ action1 ] ) with a generic lagrangian @xmath30 restricted only by the order of derivatives of @xmath60 . )",
    "does not contain higher order derivatives of @xmath60 .",
    "this is the result of the special renormalization @xcite , which does not introduce into the minisuperspace sector of einstein theory extra degrees of freedom .",
    "this choice was motivated in @xcite by ghost - free requirements and certain universality properties which , in particular , relate the value of the casimir energy in ( [ effaction ] ) , @xmath61 , to the coefficient @xmath38 of the conformal anomaly @xcite . ] below we apply this technique to the cft diven cosmology of the above type for a set of one - fold instantons with @xmath51 .",
    "cosmological instantons in the trace anomaly driven cosmology were also considered in @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that setting the problem and the field - theoretical model itself in this work are essentially different from our approach in @xcite . to begin with",
    ", the solutions of @xcite correspond to the hartle - hawking no - boundary wavefunction and have the @xmath62-topology in contrast to our periodic @xmath5 instantons associated with the microcanonical statistical sum .",
    "therefore , the amount of radiation in @xcite is a freely specifiable constant of integration , while here it is strictly fixed by the  bootstrap \" equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) .",
    "secondly , the freedom of uv renormalization is not used in @xcite to eradicate higher order derivatives from the friedmann equation , whereas in @xcite this freedom is fixed by the requirement to preserve the classical number of physical degrees of freedom and the stability of the theory against higher - derivative ghosts ( cf .",
    "footnote 2 above ) .",
    "finally , a primordial ( or renormalized ) cosmological constant is assumed to be zero in @xcite , whereas here @xmath22 belongs to a nontrivial range where it parameterizes the istanton solutions .    as a result",
    "the so - called double - bubble instantons of @xcite do not exist in our setting .",
    "this automatically removes the collapsing universes found in @xcite by analytic continuation to the physical lorentzian time .",
    "instead we have a thermal version of the hartle - hawking instantons  the instanton garlands of @xcite which give rise to expanding lorentzian universes with different values of the primordial cosmological constant @xmath22 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , they contain a rapidly diluting radiation of conformal particles and have a finite inflationary stage terminating with the decay of @xmath22 if the latter has a composite nature of a slowly varying inflaton field .",
    "this justifies the use these instantons as initial conditions for the universe , capable of formation of the observable large scale structure .",
    "note that in our setting even the vacuum hartle - hawking instantons mentioned above originate from the periodic boundary conditions as a limiting case when a torus @xmath63 gets ripped at the vanishing value of @xmath64 and topologically becomes a 4-sphere @xmath62 .",
    "thus , these round sphere instantons exist just like in @xcite , ) for @xmath65 exactly coincides with its analogue ( 2.18 ) in @xcite under a special choice of the uv counter term @xmath66 which eradicates higher order derivatives from this equation .",
    "but , as mentioned in @xcite , the inclusion of higher derivatives induced by @xmath67 does not destroy a round sphere instanton , while adding a nonvanishing cosmological constant only modifies its effective hubble parameter . ]",
    "but as mentioned above they are completely ruled out by their infinite positive euclidean action @xmath68 @xcite  the diverging contribution of the conformal anomaly .",
    "quite interestingly , this property was not observed in @xcite because the action @xmath69 was not calculated there .",
    "the one - loop preexponential factor of the statistical sum ( [ z ] ) was obtained in @xcite for a one - fold instaton background . for a theory with the generic effective action ( [ action1 ] ) it reads as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is",
    "a kind of a specific heat of the thermal bath of matter quanta and @xmath72 is a special functional of the background solution @xmath25 .",
    "as shown in @xcite this quantity also generates the functional determinant @xmath73 of the operator @xmath74 of small disturbances of the canonically normalized mode of the scale factor perturbation @xmath75 propagating on this background implies gauging out the zero mode of this operator , originating from the residual conformal killing symmetry of the action for @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "] , @xmath77 this operator is expressed via the function @xmath78 which simultaneously serves as its zero mode , @xmath79 , and in its turn expresses in terms of the time derivative of the scale factor @xmath80 and the hessian of the lagrangian @xmath30 . thus all the quantities are functionals of this zero mode which itself is easily calculable by eq.([g ] ) for a given instanton background .    the quantity @xmath81 expresses in quadratures as a functional of @xmath82 as follows .",
    "for a one - fold instanton the function @xmath83 has one oscillation in the full range of the euclidean time forming a circle .",
    "therefore , it has two zeroes at the antipodal points of this circle @xmath84 corresponding to a maximum and minimum values of the scale factor .",
    "these points mark the boundaries of the half period of the total time range , @xmath85 , at which the periodic function @xmath82 has these two first degree zeros @xmath86 then @xmath81 is given by a combination @xmath87 of boundary values at these points of a special ( non - periodic ) solution @xmath88 of the homogeneous equation @xmath89 with the same operator ( [ operator ] ) .",
    "this solution is defined by the equation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is some fixed point belonging to this half period range of @xmath4 .",
    "the main property of the function @xmath88 is that it is smoothly defined in the half - period range of @xmath4 and @xmath91 , where the integral ( [ psi ] ) is convergent because the roots of @xmath82 do not occur in the integration range of ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "it can not be smoothly continued beyond this half - period , though its limits are well defined for @xmath92 , @xmath93 because the factor @xmath82 tending to zero compensates for the divergence of the integral at @xmath94 . moreover , because of @xmath95 the function @xmath88 is differentiable at @xmath94 , and all the quantities which enter the algorithm ( [ bfi ] ) are well defined .",
    "these properties of @xmath96 guarantee that @xmath72 is independent of an arbitrary choice of the point @xmath91 , which can be easily verified by using a simple relation @xmath97 .",
    "the structure of ( [ prefactor0 ] ) suggests that the effect of the one - loop prefactor can be strong , because the argument of the square root can tend to zero .",
    "though the factor @xmath98 which is proportional to the negative of the specific heat of the thermal bath , @xmath99 is always negative , the sign of @xmath100 is indefinite .",
    "indeed , this quantity can be rewritten as the action functional of the mode @xmath88 in the half period of the euclidean time range @xmath101 its sign depends on the sign of the hessian matrix in ( [ bfi ] ) ( ghost or non - ghost nature of scale factor perturbation @xmath76 in the gravitational action ) . moreover ,",
    "the integral here is also indefinite , because the potential term is not positive - definite .",
    "in fact it is basically negative ( @xmath76 is a tachyon ) , because for an oscillating @xmath102 this function is quasi - harmonic with @xmath103 in the average over the oscillation period . in particular , for a constant @xmath104 , the function @xmath82 is harmonically oscillating , the function @xmath88 is exactly calculable and @xmath100 identically vanishes  the case of the second zero mode of @xmath105 complimentary to @xmath82 @xcite , @xmath106 therefore , a nontrivial expression for the prefactor is based on the anharmonicity of @xmath82 and should be analyzed numerically or by some kind of perturbation theory .",
    "now we apply the above technique to the model of the cft driven cosmology described in introduction .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , all saddle - point instantons of this model exist only inside the curvilinear wedge in the two - dimensional plane of the variables @xmath107  primordial cosmological constant @xmath32 and the amount of radiation constant @xmath40 , depicted in fig.1 .",
    "this wedge is bounded by the lower straight - line and upper hyperbolic boundaries , @xmath108 the one - parameter families of k - fold instantons form in this plane the curves interpolating between these two boundaries , and their sequence accumulates at the critical point corresponding to the quantum gravity scale @xmath109 .",
    "each instanton solution is represented by a point on one of these curves with the corresponding @xmath46  the number of oscillations of the scale factor @xmath60 between its minimal and maximal values .",
    "the range of @xmath22 in which these @xmath46-fold instantons exist is given by a projection of their family on the axes of the variable @xmath52 .",
    "here we consider only the one - fold family .",
    "analytic estimates of the prefactor are hard to make even in the limit of a large number of quantum fields @xmath110 and a large value of @xmath38 , because as we will now see this one - loop factor is @xmath111 and is not sensitive to this limit . a natural quantity that could have played",
    "the role of a smallness parameter is the combination @xmath112 which belongs to the bounded range @xmath113 for all these instantons .",
    "as was shown in @xcite for multi - fold instantons with @xmath114 this quantity is indeed small @xmath115 and corresponds to solutions tending to the corner of the curvilinear triangle @xmath116  the point of a new quantum gravity scale @xmath117 .",
    "unfortunately , for the case of @xmath51 instanton which only we consider here @xmath118 and the corresponding prefactor should be calculated numerically .    to make this calculation manageable",
    "let us first parameterize the instanton solutions in a more convenient way in terms of the quantity ( [ varepsilon ] ) . from the modified friedmann equation ( [ efeq ] )",
    "we know that the scale factor is a function of time oscillating between the two turning points @xmath119 . in terms of a dimensionless variable @xmath120 this behavior can be expressed as a solution of ( [ efeq ] ) for the time derivative of @xmath10 @xmath121 where the turning points @xmath122 and @xmath123 read in terms of @xmath38 , @xmath40 and @xmath124 as @xmath125    in terms of @xmath124 the curvilinear wedge ( [ wedge ] ) where the instantons are located looks as @xmath126 inside this domain the one - parameter family of solutions interpolating between its boundaries can be labeled by the parameter @xmath127 ranging from @xmath128 at the upper boundary to @xmath129 at the lower boundary @xmath130 together with the definition ( [ varepsilon ] ) this relation is just a relabeling of the solutions from the dimensional variables @xmath131 to the dimensionless @xmath132 having a simple finite range inside a unit quadrangle .    in terms of @xmath127",
    "the turning points of the solution @xmath122 and the parameter @xmath133 introduced above take the form @xmath134 with @xmath135 parameterized between the two turning points by the new variable @xmath136 @xmath137 the equation for @xmath80 can be written down as @xmath138^{1/2}+1-d+2d\\,x } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the conformal time period of the instanton equals @xmath139^{1/2 }      + 1-d+2d\\,x\\right)^{1/2 } }      { ( 1-\\varepsilon d+2\\varepsilon^2 d x)}.    \\label{eta10 }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a very good accuracy for all @xmath124 and @xmath127 the integral here equals @xmath140 , so that @xmath141 . on the other hand ,",
    "the bootstrap equation ( [ bootstrap ] ) for @xmath124 in view of ( [ cvsepsilon ] ) reads @xmath142 in view of the fact that both @xmath143 and @xmath144 for a large number of species @xmath145 , the ratio on the right hand side here is @xmath146 , and the parameter @xmath124 also remains @xmath111 and is not sensitive to the limit of large @xmath145 .",
    "then one can easily check that in the limits of either small , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , or relatively large , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , values of @xmath43 this equation yields the value of @xmath124 close to the middle of its admissible range @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "this confirms that for a one - fold garland instanton @xmath124 never gets either very small or close to one , and numerical simulations become inevitable for the calculation of the prefactor ( [ prefactor0 ] ) with its basic quantity ( [ bfi ] ) .",
    "fortunately , this leads to a simple qualitative picture .",
    "the function ( [ g ] ) for the lagrangian of ( [ effaction ] ) equals in terms of the variable @xmath135 , ( [ z ] ) , and the running integration parameter @xmath136 of eq.([x ] ) @xmath153^{1/2}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore the function ( [ psi ] ) is given by the following integral @xmath154^{1/2 }      + 1-d+2d\\,y\\right)^{3/2 } }      { \\big[\\,\\big(1-d\\big)^2 + 4d\\big(1-\\varepsilon\\,d\\big)\\,y      + 4\\varepsilon\\,d^2 y^2\\,\\big]^{1/2 } } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration limits equal @xmath155    in the limit @xmath94 ( equivalent to @xmath156 and @xmath157 ) the integral in ( [ gint ] ) is divergent , this divergence being compensated by the factor @xmath82 vanishing at these points . for the calculation of ( [ bfi ] ) we have to take these limits , and their calculation is based on a preliminary integration by parts in @xmath158 which disentangles the divergent part of the integral , @xmath159 at @xmath156 or @xmath160 at @xmath157 . then multiplying the result by @xmath82 and differentiating we get in view of ( [ psipm ] ) ( we take into account that for the cft driven cosmology @xmath161 ) @xmath162 this expression is , of course , independent of the choice of the intermediate point @xmath163 , as is easily seen by differentiation with respect to @xmath163 .",
    "for @xmath164 the function @xmath165 , so that @xmath72 is finite in this limit even despite @xmath166 in the denominator of ( [ bfifinal ] ) .",
    "note that the limit @xmath164 corresponds to the upper hyperbolic boundary of the instanton domain ( [ wedge ] ) on which the cosmological model is static , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 is constant .",
    "so this is the case of the harmonic function @xmath82 in eq.([harmonic ] ) for which formally @xmath169  the case of the second zero mode of the operator @xmath170 , discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , in this limit not only the deviation from harmonicity @xmath171 disappears , but also the amplitude of the function @xmath172 tends to zero , cf .",
    "eq.([g1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in view of ( [ harmonic ] ) the function @xmath173 acquires a @xmath174 factor , and does not vanish for @xmath164 .",
    "thus , quantum corrections to the preexponential factor are nontrivial even in this limit .",
    "as we will see below , they are smaller than those of @xmath175 but still nonzero .    numerical calculation of ( [ g ] ) can be approximately done in the full range of @xmath127 .",
    "first we find from the bootstrap equation ( [ bootstrap1 ] ) the value of @xmath124 as a function of @xmath127 on the relevant one - parameter family of instantons @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and then evaluate with the aid of ( [ bfifinal ] ) , ( [ g ] ) and ( [ specificheat ] ) the preexponential factor on this family @xmath178    we will explicitly demonstrate this procedure on the example of a single gauge vector field . for this field the trace anomaly coefficient @xmath38 and the sum ( [ energy ] ) over its oscillator frequencies @xmath179 , @xmath180 , read as @xmath181 with these expressions and the conformal time @xmath43 given by the integral ( [ eta10 ] ) the numerical solution of the bootstrap equation ( [ bootstrap1 ] ) can be sufficiently accurately fitted by the following function @xmath182 which parameterizes the one - fold family of instantons",
    ". then we compute @xmath72 via ( [ bfifinal])-([g ] ) , which turns out to be negative on this family , and also evaluate the specific heat for the free energy of vector particles on a 3-sphere @xmath183 the use of ( [ p(d ) ] ) for this family of solutions finally yields the plot of @xmath184 depicted on fig.2 .",
    "a characteristic feature of this vector field case is that with @xmath185 and negative @xmath72 the denominator of @xmath184 is smaller than one , but never degenerates to zero .",
    "therefore , the one - loop prefactor stays slightly higher than one , but remains finite and within the perturbation theory range .",
    "similar calculations can be done for pure massless spinor and conformal scalar fields .",
    "the prefactor for these fields remains nearly constant throughout the whole family of one - fold instantons .",
    "for a spinor field the behavior of @xmath186 is qualitatively the same as in the vector field case , whereas for a scalar field the calculations show that @xmath187 and the prefactor turns out to be smaller than one , @xmath188 .",
    "possible mixtures of various spins do not qualitatively change this picture .",
    "the one - loop prefactor of the statistical sum in the cft driven cosmology was obtained for a limited set of saddle - point solutions having one oscillation of the cosmological scale factor .",
    "this limitation is currently explained by the fact that the major ingredient of the calculational algorithm  the restricted functional determinant of the operator @xmath170 is known in a closed form ( [ detfstar ] ) only for this simplest set of instantons @xcite .",
    "the resulting preexponetial factor does not present us with new physics , because for all scalar , spinor and vector conformal particles or their combinations the prefactor remains a smooth function @xmath189 .",
    "it justifies the semiclassical expansion , but does not feature phase transitions or strong coupling range beyond perturbation theory restrictions even in the limit of numerous conformal species @xmath190 . at the same time path integral applications in such conformal cosmology suggest the existence of instantons with an arbitrary number of oscillations of the cosmological scale factor .",
    "in particular , for the number of these oscillations tending to infinity this cft driven cosmology approaches a new quantum gravity scale @xmath191  the maximum possible value of the cosmological constant @xcite  where the physics and , in particular , the effects of the quantum prefactor become very interesting and important .",
    "thus the extension of the above results to the full set of cosmological instantons looks very promising , as this extension might be relevant to the resolution of the cosmological constant and landscape problems @xcite .",
    "we hope to attain this extension in the foreseeable future .",
    "main difficulty with all known applications of quantum gravity and cosmology is that the lack of uv complete theory forces us to work within the effective field theory trustable only below its cutoff . in this respect",
    "large @xmath145 cft driven cosmology of @xcite seems to be a safe theory because its instanton curvature scale is bounded by @xmath192 which is much lower than the planck scale .",
    "therefore , no non - perturbative extension ( like the hypothetical asymptotic safety of quantum gravity @xcite ) is likely to be needed , and a usual semiclassical expansion is sufficient to handle the problem of cosmological initial conditions . however , as persuasively advocated in @xcite , the cutoff in theories with a large number of quantum species , @xmath193 , also decreases with the growing @xmath145 and the instantons considered above turn out to be very close to this cutoff scale .",
    "this makes important the computation of loop corrections initiated above .",
    "finiteness of the one - loop order and its regularity @xmath189 in the full one - fold instanton range of @xmath22 gives a hope that this property will survive beyond this range and beyond one - loop approximation , and this is a subject of our further studies @xcite .",

    "<S> the path integration technique recently developed for the statistical sum of the microcanonical ensemble in cosmology is applied to the calculation of the one - loop preexponential factor in the cosmological model generated by a conformal field theory with a large number of quantum species  the model of initial conditions possibly related to the resolution of the cosmological constant and landscape problems . </S>",
    "<S> the result is obtained for the family of background cosmological instantons with one oscillation of the frw scale factor . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the prefactor is analytically and numerically estimated for fields of various spins conformally coupled to gravity , which justifies the validity of semiclassical expansion for this family of cosmological instantons . </S>"
