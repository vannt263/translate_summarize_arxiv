    "planetary astrophysics is undergoing an epoch of explosive growth driven by the discovery of about 850 exoplanets in two decades .",
    "continuous improvement in detection techniques will uncover many more planets in the near future which are too small or too far from their host star to be detected at present .",
    "observations suggest that planet formation is ubiquitous , with more than 40% of nearby sun - like stars harboring at least one planet less massive than saturn @xcite .",
    "these prolific discoveries have revealed the amazing diversity of exoplanetary systems and indicated that planets may form under a wide range of conditions and have considerable mobility .",
    "the diversity of exoplanets has been particularly highlighted by the kepler s space mission .",
    "to date , kepler has detected over 2300 planet candidates @xcite , from which more than a hundred are confirmed planets ( http://kepler.nasa.gov ) .",
    "about one third of kepler s candidates are associated with multiple transiting systems and the vast majority of them are expected to be real multi - planetary systems @xcite .",
    "some of these systems show remarkable properties , like the five coplanar , alternating rocky and icy planets orbiting kepler-20 in less than 80 days @xcite . interactions between planets and their parent protoplanetary disk are likely to have played a major role in shaping such compact system .",
    "a striking feature of kepler s multi - planetary systems is the large number of planet pairs far from mean - motion resonances ( hereafter mmr , * ? ? ?",
    "planet pairs near resonances show some tendency to have period ratios slightly greater than resonant values ( see figure  [ fig : kepler ] ; period ratios are defined as the outer planet s orbital period divided by the inner planet s ) .",
    "for instance , there are almost twice as many planet pairs with period ratios between 2.0 and 2.1 than between 1.9 to 2.0 .",
    "this intriguing feature could naturally arise from tidal orbital circularization of close - in resonant planet pairs @xcite .",
    "however , as stressed by the histograms in figure  [ fig : kepler ] , the same trend holds for planet pairs where the orbital period of the inner planet exceeds 10 days , most particularly near first - order resonances . for such systems , tidal circularization is unlikely to have caused significant divergent evolution of the planets orbits , as shown in section  [ sec : tidal ] of the appendix .",
    "an example of a planetary system with a period ratio slightly greater than resonant is the kepler-46 system ( previously known as koi-872 ) .",
    "the 0.9 solar - mass star is surrounded by a @xmath0 transiting planet on a 33.6 day period ( kepler-46b ) .",
    "large transit time variations ( ttv ) of kepler-46b are caused by the presence of an outer planet , kepler-46c , whose mass ( @xmath1 ) and orbital period ( 57.0 days ) have been determined by @xcite .",
    "the same authors have also reported the detection of a @xmath2 planet candidate on a 6.8 day period ( kepler-46d , not yet confirmed ) .",
    "the main properties of the kepler-46 planetary system are summarized in table  [ tab : tablekoi ] .",
    "the low - eccentricity and quasi - coplanar orbits in this system suggest that the planets reached their present location most probably through disk - planet interactions . still , the ratio or orbital periods between kepler-46c and kepler-46b is @xmath3 , which is slightly greater than @xmath4 .",
    "capture in the 5:3 mmr is not a natural outcome of planet migration driven by disk - planet interactions .",
    "it requires a rate of convergent migration that is large enough to cross the 2:1 mmr , but not too large so that the planets do not reach their 3:2 mmr . capture into a second - order resonance also requires small but not zero eccentricities , which disk - planet interactions tend to damp quite efficiently .",
    "should disk - planet interactions have led kepler-46b and kepler-46c to reach their 5:3 mmr , it is unclear how their period ratio would have then increased to their present value .",
    "the initial motivation of this work is to investigate under what circumstances disk - planets interactions may account for the orbital period ratio between kepler-46c and kepler-46b . in section  [ sec : hydro ] , we present results of hydrodynamical simulations modeling the early evolution of both planets as they were embedded in their parent protoplanetary disk .",
    "these saturn - mass planets are expected to open a partial gap around their orbit .",
    "a rapid convergent migration causes the planets to merge their gap and to evolve into a common gap .",
    "the planets convergent migration is found to stall with period ratios between 1.5 and 1.7 , depending on the disk s density profile inside the common gap .",
    "the observed period ratio can be reproduced without the planets being in resonance .",
    "furthermore , we show that disk - driven migration of partial gap - opening planets may lead to significant divergent evolution of planet pairs over typical disk lifetimes .",
    "such divergent evolution is shown to arise from the interaction between planets and the wakes of their companions .",
    "this mechanism is illustrated for super - earth - mass planets in section  [ sec : results_nbody ] with both hydrodynamical simulations and customized three - body integrations .",

    "this is not an issue in this study , however , since we consider partial gap - opening planets for which the corotation torque has a rather weak effect on migration .",

    "as the planets progressively clear a partial gap around their orbit , convergent migration does not occur at a constant rate .",
    "in particular , the inward migration of the outer planet slightly accelerates at early times due to a stage of type iii migration @xcite before slowing down upon approaching the 2:1 mmr with the inner planet .",
    "the planets are locked in the 2:1 mmr from about 300 orbits onwards , as can be seen from the libration of the resonant angles associated with this resonance .",
    "the resonance capture increases the inner planet s eccentricity to about 0.035 .",
    "the increase in the outer planet s eccentricity is much more modest , reaching about @xmath61 , even though the mass ratio of the planets is near unity .",
    "this modest increase in the outer planet s eccentricity arises from the contribution of the indirect term nearly cancelling the contribution from the direct term to the term that is first order in the eccentricities in the development of the disturbing function , which governs the response of the outer planet at a 2:1 mmr ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "damping of the eccentricities follows from the gravitational interaction with the background gas disk .",
    "interestingly , the ratio of orbital periods rises from 2.02 to 2.15 in only 1500 orbits , while the eccentricities are damped .",

    "this case is particularly interesting as it shows that convergent migration may stall with an orbital period ratio very close to the observed value ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the accelerating inward migration of the outer planet is particularly visible in the first 100 orbits .",
    "this runaway migration is fueled by the dense gas region located between the two planet gaps .",
    "this dense material is continuously funneled beyond the outer planet s orbit upon embarking on horseshoe u - turns with respect to the outer planet .",
    "the density between the two planet gaps therefore decreases , and so does the migration rate of the outer planet .",
    "convergent migration then proceeds at a slower pace and the planets end up merging their gap , thereby forming a common gap in the disk .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : dens ] , which compares the disk s surface density at 400 orbits for the two aforementioned simulations which have @xmath59 and @xmath69 ( top panel ) , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "while in the former case a narrow ring of gas is left between the two planet gaps , the latter case shows that both planets end up in a common gap . back to the second row of panels in figure  [",
    "fig : ex ] , we see that the orbital period ratio remains approximately stationary from about 400 orbits , and so do the eccentricities .",
    "the time - averaged eccentricity of the inner planet is close to 0.01 ; that of the outer planet is @xmath70 .",
    "these values are consistent , albeit slight larger than those inferred from observations ( see table  [ tab : tablekoi ] ) .",
    "note from the critical angles that the planets are not locked in the 5:3 mmr .",
    "lastly , the third row of panels in figure  [ fig : ex ] is for @xmath71 and @xmath72 . here , convergent migration is rapid enough that the planets approximately reach the nominal location of their 3:2 mmr ( the minimum value of the period ratio is @xmath73 at 170 orbits ) .",
    "the planet eccentricities increase to about 0.03 ( inner planet ) and 0.015 ( outer planet ) .",
    "subsequent damping of the eccentricities occurs along with a slight divergent evolution of the planets .",
    "the rate of divergent evolution is much reduced compared to the 2:1 mmr case shown in the top row of panels in figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "we will analyse this result further in section  [ sec : divergent ] .",
    "we also point out that no steady - state has been reached at the end of the simulation . for this simulation , as for all simulations of the kepler-46 system , results are shown until the inner planet reaches @xmath74 , below which the proximity of the grid s inner edge ( at @xmath75 ) starts affecting the planets orbital evolution .",
    "the final period ratio obtained in all our simulations is displayed in figure  [ fig : finalopr ] as a function of @xmath25 for the three masses assumed for kepler-46b . by final period ratio , we mean either its value obtained at the end of the simulation ( after between 1500 and 2000 planet orbits ) , or that obtained when the inner planet s orbital radius falls below @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig : finalopr ] highlights the three major outcomes of our simulations : ( i ) capture in 2:1 mmr generally followed by rapid divergent evolution , ( ii ) capture in 3:2 mmr followed by slow divergent evolution , and ( iii ) convergent migration stalling with a period ratio between 1.6 and 1.7 , depending on the disk s density distribution inside the planets common gap .",
    "several simulations can reproduce the observed period ratio of kepler-46b and kepler-46c .",
    "the best agreement with observations is obtained for @xmath66 , our upper mass value .",
    "this mass would imply a mean density for kepler-46b about 20% larger than jupiter s ( that is , about 1.6 g @xmath77 ) .",
    "the results of hydrodynamical simulations in section  [ sec : illust ] show that the orbital period ratio of two partial gap - opening planets may increase from a near resonant value .",
    "this divergent evolution is reminiscent of the late evolution of short - period planet pairs through star - planet tidal interactions . in that case",
    ", tidal circularization causes a slow divergent evolution of the orbits @xcite , a mechanism known as tidally - driven resonant repulsion @xcite .",
    "it is based on energy dissipation of the planet pair while its total angular momentum remains constant @xcite .",
    "do we have an analogous resonant repulsion mechanism due to disk - planets interactions ? to address this question , it is instructive to first look at the evolution of two embedded planets that do not interact gravitationally . in figure",
    "[ fig : fono ] we compare the results of two hydrodynamical simulations : one in which the gravitational interaction between the planets is switched off ( both the direct and the indirect interaction terms are discarded ) and another where the planet - planet interaction is fully accounted for .",

    "the other disk and planet parameters are those described in section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "when planet - planet interactions are on , capture into the 2:1 mmr is followed by rapid divergent evolution and damping of the eccentricities .",
    "this case is similar to that presented in the top row of panels in figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "quite surprisingly , we see that a very similar divergent evolution is also obtained when planet - planet interactions are switched off , while the planets are not resonantly coupled ( the resonant angles do not librate ) and their eccentricities take vanishingly small stationary values .",
    "this comparison highlights that , when disk - planet interactions are considered , eccentricity damping is not necessarily responsible for the planets divergent evolution .",
    "the divergent evolution of a planet pair may instead be driven by changes to the disk - planet interaction brought about through the proximity of the planets to each other , such as the development of an interaction between each planet and the wake of its companion .",
    "we argue below that the damping of the eccentricities can actually be a consequence of divergent evolution driven by wake - planet interaction .    before describing the process of wake - planet interaction in more detail , we briefly report that , in some other simulations , not illustrated here , with planet - planet interactions switched off , a tiny increase in the orbital eccentricities",
    "is observed when the orbital period ratio takes near resonant values .",
    "eccentricities may reach a few @xmath81 before being damped by the disk .",
    "although this is a small effect , it suggests that planets could be weakly resonantly coupled through interaction with the wakes and/or the circumplanetary disk of their companions . in our simulations ,",
    "the mass of the circumplanetary disks does not exceed one percent of the planets mass .",
    "+    _ wake - planet interactions _ the results of simulations shown in figure  [ fig : fono ] make clear that disk - driven divergent evolution of a planet pair is not necessarily driven by eccentricity damping and it may continue to operate even when the eccentricities are very small .",
    "we here indicate how the interaction between a planet and the wake of its companion could act as a driving mechanism for divergent evolution .",
    "consider for instance the inner planet .",
    "its outer wake carries positive fluxes of angular momentum and energy .",
    "a fraction of this angular momentum flux can be deposited in the coorbital region of the outer planet through the dissipation of shocks , and then transferred to the outer planet via an effective positive corotation torque ( see * ? ? ?",
    "associated with the angular momentum flux @xmath82 deposited in the coorbital region of the outer planet is an energy flux @xmath83 , where @xmath84 denotes the inner planet s mean motion ( or angular velocity ) . from this energy flux",
    ", @xmath85 is used to keep the outer planet and its coorbital region nearly circular ( see figure  [ fig : fono ] ; here , @xmath86 is the outer planet s mean motion ) .",
    "the remaining energy flux , @xmath87 , is dissipated in the outer planet s coorbital region .",
    "reciprocally , a fraction of the negative inward flux of angular momentum carried by the inner wake of the outer planet can be deposited in the inner planet s coorbital region and subsequently transmitted to the inner planet .",
    "again , this exchange is associated with energy dissipation in the disk at a rate equal to the ( absolute value of ) the product of the flux of angular momentum transmitted to the inner planet by the outer one and the difference in the planets angular velocities .",
    "this dissipation occurs , as is usual in disk - planet interactions , through the tidally excited density waves steepening into shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "numerically , shocks are dealt with through a combination of numerical diffusion and the application of an artificial viscosity . as a locally isothermal equation of state",
    "is adopted in our simulations , this dissipated energy is effectively lost to the system through cooling . while the total orbital energy of the two planets is dissipated due to the wake - planet interactions described above , their total angular momentum remains unaltered .",
    "as studied in the context of star - planet tidal interactions , energy dissipation at constant angular momentum leads to the divergent evolution of a planet pair @xcite .",
    "we now derive an equation satisfied by the period ratio of the two planets as a direct consequence of considering the evolution of their total orbital energy and angular momentum .",
    "we denote by @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 the semi - major axis , eccentricity and mass of the inner planet ( with the subscript changed to o denoting the same quantities for the outer planet ) .",
    "the total angular momentum of the two planets is @xmath91 which gives , correct to second order in the eccentricities , @xmath92 we are looking for changes in the planets semi - major axes and eccentricities that occur on similar timescales , we may therefore discard the eccentricity terms in the expressions for @xmath93 @xmath94 and @xmath95 . denoting by @xmath96 and @xmath97 the torques exerted by the disk on the inner and outer planets , respectively ,",

    "the first arises from the energy dissipation in the disk resulting from the action of the torques @xmath102 as these are negative this energy is removed from the orbital motion .",
    "the second originates from orbital circularization due to disk - planet interactions .",
    "the quantities @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the circularization times for the planets that arise from the disk torque and energy dissipation acting on each planet through the effects of its own wake @xcite .",
    "the third and final contribution @xmath105 stems from the energy dissipation due to wake - planet interactions .",
    "we remark that wake dissipation in the coorbital region of the outer planet contributes @xmath106 to @xmath107 , in addition to a corresponding contribution arising from the coorbital region of the inner planet , as indicated above .",
    "note that terms of order @xmath108 are retained above even though the eccentricities are small as it is assumed that @xmath109 are small enough so that dissipation through circularization could be as important as , or even dominate the other effects under some circumstances .",

    "( [ eq_pr ] ) shows that , far from resonance , where the eccentricities are very small , the planet s period ratio @xmath112 decreases as a consequence of convergent migration , provided that @xmath113 as expected , the latter condition is that the inward migration rate of the outer planet should exceed the inward migration rate of the inner planet .",
    "as the eccentricities increase as resonance is approached , a steady state may be reached in which the planets period ratio and eccentricities take stationary values .",
    "if the eccentricity damping timescales are sufficiently short , disk - driven circularization of the orbits can reverse convergent migration , that is the planets period ratio can increase .",
    "( [ eq_pr ] ) highlights that wake - planet interactions may also lead to divergent evolution of a planet pair .",

    "similar divergent evolution of a non - resonant planet pair embedded in a disk , comprising a jupiter and a super - earth , was reported by @xcite .",
    "when divergent evolution is primarily due to wake - planet interactions , as the period ratio of the planet pair increases away from a resonant value , the distance to resonance increases , and the forced eccentricities therefore decrease ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it implies that orbital circularization is a natural consequence of divergent evolution driven by wake - planet interactions .",
    "this is actually a major difference between the divergent evolutions driven by wake - planet interactions and by orbital circularization ( through the disk or stellar tides ) : eccentricity damping is the consequence of the former mechanism , while it is the cause of the latter .",
    "note that , with both mechanisms , the divergent evolution of a resonant planet pair maintains the libration of the resonant angles by damping the eccentricities .",
    "we call _ disk - driven resonant repulsion _ the divergent evolution of a resonant planet pair embedded in a disk , following the terminology introduced by @xcite for the divergent evolution of a resonant planet pair due to star - planet tidal interactions .",
    "we stress that disk - driven resonant repulsion can have two origins : ( i ) disk circularization of the orbits and ( ii ) wake - planet interactions .",
    "in other words , disk - driven repulsion comprises ( i ) _ circularization - driven repulsion _ and ( ii ) _ wake - driven repulsion_. the results of hydrodynamical simulations shown above indicate that , for the disk and planet parameters that we have considered , wake - planet repulsion dominates circularization - driven repulsion .",
    "this point will be further illustrated in sect .",
    "[ sec : nbody_method ] .",
    "+    _ when is wake - driven repulsion important? _ we have seen above that the period ratio of a planet pair embedded in a disk may increase due to angular momentum transfer between the planets through their wakes .",
    "we further discuss in this paragraph under what conditions wake - planet interactions may lead to efficient divergent evolution of a planet pair .",
    "we separate the planet pair into a donor and a recipient .",
    "the bigger the donor s mass , the stronger its wake , and the easier for the wake to deposit angular momentum in the coorbital region of the recipient planet through the dissipation of shocks .",
    "this requires the dimensionless parameter @xmath17 of the donor planet to typically exceed unity ( @xmath18 is the planet - to - star mass ratio and @xmath114 the disk s aspect ratio ) . the donor planet can thus be a partial or a deep gap - opening planet .",
    "the angular momentum that is deposited by the donor s wake is ( at least partly ) transferred to the recipient planet through an effective corotation torque @xcite .",
    "if the recipient s mass is too big , the density in its coorbital region will be too low for this effective corotation torque to matter .",
    "in other words , the recipient could be a partial gap - opening planet or even a type - i migrating planet .",
    "these considerations show why divergent evolution is neither expected for two type - i migrating planets ( the donor s wake being too weak ) , nor for two type - ii migrating planets ( the recipient s gap being too deep ) .",
    "we have checked this with hydrodynamical simulations , not illustrated here .",
    "the above considerations also help understand the different rates of divergent evolution obtained in figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "the fact that both planets open a partial gap is a favorable situation for wake - planet interactions to play a significant role . in the top row of panels , where the planets become locked in the 2:1 mmr , the high - density region between the two gaps ( see upper panel in figure  [ fig : dens ] ) causes significant deposition of angular momentum in the planets coorbital region and therefore very efficient divergent evolution .",
    "in contrast , in the bottom row of panels , where the planets merge their gap and become locked in the 3:2 mmr , the moderate disk density left between the planets can only trigger slow divergent evolution . in the middle row of panels , where the period ratio stalls near 1.7 , a steady state is reached with background convergent migration balanced by wake - planet divergent evolution .",
    "+    _ evolution towards a steady state _ when the planets are widely separated , they are expected to interact with the disk independently of each other and they can then enter a convergent migration phase . as they approach each other both planet - planet interactions , and wake - planet interactions where the planets interact with each others wakes can occur .",
    "both these processes involve exchanges of orbital energy and angular momentum between the planets .",
    "planet - planet interactions can result in resonant trapping associated with the growth of eccentricities , while wake - planet interactions act to produce divergent migration without the growth of eccentricities . from eq .",
    "( [ eq_pr ] ) we see that both circularization- and wake - driven resonant repulsions act together to increase the period ratio .",
    "if wake - driven repulsion dominates after the eccentricities have damped to low values , with @xmath115 remaining constant , the period ratio should increase linearly with time , which is roughly what is obtained in the simulation presented in the top row of panels in figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "however , in the longer term @xmath116 should decrease with time as the planets separate , which indicates that a steady state should be ultimately reached with convergent migration driven by background disk torques balancing wake - driven repulsion .",
    "we stress that wake - planet interactions cause a non - linear evolution of the disk s density profile near the planets , which may affect the time evolution of the background torques responsible for convergent migration . at least in the simulation without planet - planet interaction of figure  [ fig : fono ] , a slow decrease in the background torques could explain why the period ratio decreases then increases , instead of reaching a stationary non - resonant value .",
    "another possibility is that convergent migration and disk - driven repulsion behave differently as the planet pair moves closer to the star , if the torques responsible for both mechanisms have different radial dependences .",
    "investigation of these aspects is deferred to a future study .",
    "the above simulations of the kepler-46 system show that the planets period ratio can take a range of values , depending on the convergent migration rate during the early evolution of the system .",
    "the limited duration of the simulations ( up to a few thousand orbits ) and the fact that planets still migrate at the end of the simulations however raise the question of the long - term evolution of the system .",
    "even when the inward migration of the planets gets stalled , further evolution of the period ratio can be maintained by disk - driven resonant repulsion .",
    "a steady state may _ a priori _ be achieved after depletion of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "disk dispersal typically occurs between @xmath117 and @xmath118 years after formation of the central star .",

    "the final period ratio remains very close to the observed value .",
    "in section  [ sec : hydro ] we have presented results of hydrodynamical simulations modeling the early evolution of kepler-46b and kepler-46c as they were embedded in their parent protoplanetary disk .",
    "the variety of period ratios obtained in our simulations raises the question of whether disk - planets interactions could partly explain the diversity of period ratios in kepler s multi - planetary systems .",
    "we review below some of the processes that might account for such diversity .",
    "as highlighted in figure  [ fig : kepler ] , kepler s multi - planetary systems show a clear tendency for planet pairs near resonances to feature period ratios slightly greater than strict commensurability",
    ". divergent evolution of a short - period resonant planet pair due to star - planet tidal interactions could partly explain this feature @xcite .",
    "although the efficiency of tidal dissipation remains largely uncertain , it is thought that efficient tidal circularization requires the inner planet to orbit its star in less than a few days .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : kepler ] many of kepler s candidate systems have an inner planet beyond 10 days , for which tidal circularization is unlikely to have caused significant resonant repulsion ( see section  [ sec : tidal ] of the appendix ) . for these systems",
    "we propose that resonant repulsion driven by disk - planets interactions could have played a prominent role in determining the observed period ratios .",
    "the vast majority of the planets in kepler s multi - planetary systems have physical radii between 0.1 and 0.3 jupiter radii , which places them in the super - earth to neptune - mass range . from the mass - radius diagram of kepler candidates followed up by radial velocity , the median mass of a 0.2 jupiter - radius planet is about 10 to 15 earth - masses ( see , e.g. , http://exoplanets.org ) .",
    "based on generally considered temperatures and viscosities in protoplanetary disks ( corresponding to @xmath128 and @xmath129 a few @xmath81 ) such planets are expected to experience type i migration .",
    "recent n - body experiments by @xcite have shown that convergent migration of type - i migrating planets yields very little departure from strict commensurability in contrast with kepler s data .",
    "he showed that the inclusion of stochastic forces in addition to type i migration could reproduce the observed distribution of period ratios quite nicely .",
    "such agreement has been obtained assuming that the initial period ratio distribution is the observed one , and taking the same convergent migration timescale and the same amplitude of stochastic forces for all kepler s multiple systems , which remains quite uncertain given the expected diversity of physical properties in protoplanetary disks .",
    "still , his results indicate that type i migration alone may not be able to account for kepler s diversity of period ratios .      based on our results of hydrodynamical simulations for the kepler-46 system",
    ", we propose that some of kepler s planet candidates in multi - planetary systems could have opened partial gaps in their parent disk , thereby escaping the type i migration regime",
    ". this could be the case if , for instance , planets formed and/or migrated in regions of low turbulent activity ( dead zones ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or if the disk s aspect ratio takes smaller values than commonly adopted .",

    ", we adopted values of @xmath114 and @xmath23 such that the dimensionless parameters in the gap - opening criterion of @xcite take the same values . for the super - earths simulations , this yields @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "we see that the planets lock themselves in the 3:2 mmr from about 1300 orbits .",
    "divergent evolution proceeds with a decrease in the planets eccentricities .",
    "after reaching exactly 1.5 at about 1500 orbits , the period ratio increases to 1.54 at 5000 orbits . as illustrated by the screenshot of the disk surface density , the proximity of the planets allows their wakes to penetrate into each others coorbital region , where they can deposit part of their angular momentum flux .",
    "as we have shown in section  [ sec : divergent ] , transfer of angular momentum between planets through wake - planet interactions will result in a loss rate of the total orbital energy of the two planets .",
    "this has the consequence of increasing the period ratio and decreasing the eccentricities . in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : m10 ] ,",
    "the unperturbed disk surface density parameter is decreased to @xmath139 . here ,",
    "convergent migration due to the background disk torques is slow enough to lock the planets in the 2:1 mmr , but this time the resonant capture does not lead to divergent evolution . instead",
    ", a steady state is reached in which both the eccentricities and the orbital period ratio take stationary values .",
    "this steady state is a consequence of negligible wake - planet interactions in this case .",
    "as illustrated in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : m10 ] , the planets are sufficiently far from each other that their wakes primarily transfer energy and angular momentum to regions of the disk that are not coorbital with the planets .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : m10 ] support the idea that disk - driven resonant repulsion of partial gap - opening super - earths may lead to period ratios that substantially differ from nominal resonant values . as shown in section  [",

    "its efficiency depends on the planets masses and the evolution of the disk s surface density .",
    "the survey of such a large parameter space is out of reach of hydrodynamical simulations , but three - body simulations with customized prescriptions for migration , eccentricity damping and disk dispersal can help illustrate the diversity of period ratios that can be achieved .",
    "this is the strategy that we have adopted . for illustration purposes we have considered fixed planet masses : @xmath140 , @xmath132 and @xmath141 ( as in section  [ sec : m10 ] ) .",
    "our three - body simulations solve the equations of motion for the two planets and the central star using a standard technique .",

    "in order to do simple modeling , and to minimize the number of free parameters , we do not attempt to parameterize the @xmath142 term .",

    "only the semi - major axis of the outer planet varies in the first 1500 orbits as our prescription for disk - driven migration is applied to the outer planet .",
    "once resonant repulsion sets in near 1500 orbits , the semi - major axis of the inner planet decreases slightly , that of the outer planet increases slightly as well .",
    "the eccentricity damping timescale here is 20 planet orbits , and this rather short timescale is found to give very similar divergent evolutions in the three - body and hydrodynamical simulations ( see top - right panel in figure  [ fig : john1 ] ) . at 5000 orbits ,",
    "the period ratio is 1.53 in the three - body run , and 1.54 in the hydrodynamical run .",
    "this small difference can be qualitatively explained by the fact that the repulsion occurs at a slightly larger pace in the hydrodynamical simulation than has been modelled in the three - body run .",
    "furthermore , we point out that the eccentricity peaks near the 2:1 and 3:2 mmrs are about a factor of 2 to 3 smaller in the three - body simulation ( compare with the eccentricities of the hydrodynamical run shown in the second upper panel of figure  [ fig : m10 ] ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is most likely a reflection of the fact that the actual circularization time in the hydrodynamical run is longer than that adopted in the three - body integration , consistent with the operation of wake - planet repulsion in addition to circularization - driven repulsion as discussed above .",
    "we also incorporated a simple model for disk dispersal , which is taken to occur between @xmath120 and @xmath117 orbits .",

    "our results are found to have very little dependence on the `` convergent migration timescale '' @xmath148 .",
    "simulations were carried out over @xmath158 orbits , and the period ratio time - averaged over the last 1000 orbits of the simulations is indicated by the color bar . for a given eccentricity damping timescale , the later disk dispersal occurs , the longer planets eccentricities are damped , and therefore the larger the final period ratio . at a given time prior to disk dispersal , the shorter the eccentricity damping timescale , the larger the final period ratio , again as expected .",
    "for the shortest damping timescales that we have considered , period ratios can reach @xmath159 1.75 . with such short timescales , planets can evolve continuously from the 3:2 mmr to the 2:1 mmr ( that is , the 2:1 resonant angles start to librate when the 3:2 resonant angles no longer librate ) .",

    ". there could be two reasons for this behavior .",
    "first , wake - planet interactions cause a ( non - linear ) evolution of the disk s density profile near the planets , which causes the torques driving convergent migration and wake - planet interaction to change over time .",
    "furthermore , independently of the previous consideration , preliminary results indicate that the torques responsible for convergent migration and for wake - driven repulsion have different dependences on the stellar distance as the planets migrate .",
    "both effects are found to strengthen wake - driven repulsion as compared to convergent migration as planets migrate inwards .",
    "this would explain why , in our simulations , the period ratio of inwardly migrating planet pairs increases after reaching a nearly constant value .",

    "we note that a significant divergent evolution of sub - jovian planets was obtained in some of the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the similarity between their results of simulations and ours ( convergent migration nearly stalled close to resonance , followed by divergent evolution of the planets orbits alongside the damping of their eccentricity ) suggests that the divergent evolution obtained in these simulations is likely to arise from wake - planet interactions .",
    "many planets in kepler s multiple systems are in the super - earth to neptune - mass range , and have orbital periods below 100 days . at these short periods",
    "the aspect ratio of a disk should be rather small , thus many kepler s planet candidates could have opened partial gaps in their parent disk .",
    "in contrast to the saturn - mass planets in the kepler-46 system , super - earths are not expected to merge their gaps and to evolve in a common gap , unless a very fast convergent migration brings them to very short mutual separations .",
    "we have argued instead that close - in super - earths are good candidates for efficient resonant repulsion caused by wake - planet interactions .",
    "for instance , one of our simulations shows that the orbital period ratio of two @xmath159 15 earth - mass planets increases from 1.5 to 1.55 in few thousand orbits .",
    "disk - driven repulsion via wake - planet interactions could explain why many planet pairs in kepler s multiple systems have period ratios slightly greater than resonant . while resonant repulsion driven by stellar tides should only be relevant to planet pairs with orbital periods below a few days",
    ", disk - driven repulsion may also apply to planets on longer periods .",
    "the ttv signals of kepler s short - period planet pairs indicate that some of these planets have small but not zero free eccentricities @xcite .",

    "we show here that star - planet tidal interactions are unlikely to cause significant divergent evolution of two planets in the super - earth mass range when the orbital period of the inner planet exceeds about 10 days . in the constant time lag model , taking tidal dissipation within the planet to be much larger than within the star , the orbital circularization timescale , @xmath165 , is given by equation ( 25 ) of @xcite and can be expressed as follows : @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the tidal quality factor of the inner planet , @xmath168 its mean density , @xmath169 its physical radius , @xmath170 its orbital period and @xmath47 is the star s mass . divergent evolution of two resonant planets may occur as a result of tidal dissipation of orbital energy at approximately constant orbital angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the timescale for divergent evolution , which we denote by @xmath171 , satisfies @xmath172 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 the semi - major axis and forced eccentricity of the inner planet , and @xmath173 its change in semi - major axis during divergent evolution ( it can be taken to be the planet s distance from resonance ) .",

    "makes the gaps carved by the planets deeper . when convergent migration is rapid enough for the planets to cross their 2:1 mmr and to evolve in a common gap , we find that the planets generally lock themselves into the 3:2 , 4:3 or even 7:5 mmr with very little departure from exact commensurability . in these simulations ,",
    "the density in the common gap is too low for wake - planet interactions to cause significant divergent evolution ( see section  [ sec : divergent ] ) .",

    "as the structure of the gaps plays a prominent role in the final evolution of the planets period ratio , we carried out additional simulations where the planets were first held on fixed circular orbits for 500 orbits before migrating .",
