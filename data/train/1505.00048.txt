    "_ product and permutation categories _ , or props for short , are tools used to describe the algebraic structure of an object .",
    "they were introduced by mac lane for the purposes of universal algebra , generalizing lawvere s notion of an algebraic theory @xcite .",
    "formally , a prop is a symmetric monoidal functor whose objects are the natural numbers and whose tensor product on objects is given by ordinary addition .",
    "if @xmath9 is a prop and @xmath10 is a symmetric monoidal category , we define an algebra of @xmath9 over @xmath10 to be a symmetric monoidal functor @xmath11 .",
    "we say that @xmath9 is the prop for a category @xmath12 if the category of algebras over @xmath9 is equivalent to @xmath12 .",
    "props are useful in providing a mathematical formalization of various sorts of diagrams used in physics and engineering , such as signal - flow diagrams @xcite . for example",
    ", a morphism @xmath13 can be visualized as a black box diagram with @xmath0 inputs and @xmath1 outputs .",
    "the monoidal category structure provides us with different ways of sticking components together  composing two morphisms @xmath14 and @xmath15 lets us connect the outputs of @xmath16 to the inputs of @xmath17 , while tensoring provides a way of placing two circuits side - by - side .",
    "a rig is generalization of a ring ( with unit ) where elements are not required to have additive inverses .",
    "some common examples include the natural numbers @xmath18 and the two - element boolean rig @xmath19 where 0 and 1 are the truth values false and true , respectively , and where addition is given by or and multiplication by and . for a commutative rig @xmath5",
    ", we define a prop @xmath4 by letting morphisms @xmath13 be @xmath20 matrices with values in @xmath5 .",
    "note that @xmath4 includes some famous categories as particular cases ; for example , @xmath21 is equivalent to the category @xmath7 of finite sets and relations between them , and @xmath22 is equivalent to the category @xmath6 of finite sets and spans between them . if @xmath2 is a field , @xmath23 is equivalent to the category of @xmath3 of finite @xmath2-vector spaces and linear maps between them .",
    "note that @xmath4 generalizes heisenberg s matrix mechanics ; @xmath24 gives the familiar case .",
    "if we let @xmath25 , then @xmath4 gives an analogue of matrix mechanics where relative probabilities replace amplitudes . if @xmath5 is the boolean rig @xmath19 , relative possibilities replace amplitudes instead .",
    "we will show :    let @xmath5 be a commutative rig .",
    "then @xmath4 is the prop for bicommutative bimonoids @xmath26 equipped with a rig map from @xmath5 to the rig of bimonoid endomorphisms on @xmath26 .    in the case that @xmath2 is the field @xmath27 of rational functions in one variable , the string diagrams of the prop @xmath23 are the signal - flow diagrams studied by baez and erbele and sobociski et al .",
    "baez and erbele show that , when coming up with a set of generators and relations of the category @xmath23 where @xmath2 is a field , the additive and multiplicative inverses do not play a role @xcite . instead of describing the prop in terms of generators and relations , our focus on describing functors out of @xmath4 give a similar characterization , but the proof is much more efficient .",
    "our method also allows @xmath4 to be compared to props describing similar structures , such as the one for bimonoids without unit or counit given in @xcite .",
    "some consequences of our theorem are that    * @xmath6 is the prop for bicommutative bimonoids ; * @xmath7 is the prop for special bicommutative bimonoids ; and * @xmath8 is the prop for bicommutative hopf monoids .",
