    "<S> we provide simple examples of closed - form gaussian wavepacket solutions of the free - particle schrdinger equation in one dimension which exhibit the most general form of the time - dependent spread in position , namely @xmath0 , where @xmath1 contains information on the position - momentum correlation structure of the initial wave packet . </S>",

    "<S> we discuss how the initial correlations in these examples can be dynamically generated ( at least conceptually ) in various bound state systems . finally , we focus on providing different ways of visualizing the @xmath3 correlations present in these cases , including the time - dependent distribution of kinetic energy and the use of the wigner quasi - probability distribution . </S>",
