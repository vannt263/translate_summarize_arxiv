    "the statement which is known under the name of the `` anderson theorem '' and belongs to p.w.anderson @xcite and abrikosov and gorkov @xcite , reads that the non - magnetic disorder does not change the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 . as a matter of fact this statement has a status of a theorem based on the normalization and completeness of the set of single - particle wave functions",
    "only if the paring amplitude @xmath1 does not have any variations in space or the latter can be averaged independently of the fluctuations of the single - particle wave functions .",
    "this is not true for sufficiently strong disorder where the joint effect of disorder and coulomb interaction leads to suppression of @xmath0 .",
    "this effect studied in detail by finkelstein @xcite was actually predicted earlier @xcite as the leading correction to the mean field transition temperature in 2d disordered superconductors : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the dimensionless constant of local interaction @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the dimensionless conductance , @xmath6 is the dos at the fermi level , @xmath7 is the diffusion constant and @xmath8 is the debye frequency .    for the screened coulomb interaction in the universal limit @xmath9 and eq.([mayfuk ] )",
    "corresponds to suppression of @xmath0 by disorder .",
    "@xmath10 however , if one assumes that the coulomb interaction is absent ( or strongly suppressed ) and the only interaction that remains is the attraction in the cooper channel characterizing by the small dimensionless constant @xmath11 , the same eq.([mayfuk ] ) together with the bcs relation @xmath12 results in : @xmath13 thus in the absence of coulomb interaction one obtains the enhancement ( w.r.t . the bcs result ) of @xmath0 by disorder by the same token as the suppression in the universal limit of the screened coulomb interaction known as the finkelstein effect @xcite .",
    "it was not understood in the eighties that the origin of both suppression and enhancement is the weak multifractality of single - particle wave functions in 2d metals .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to make this connection physically transparent .",
    "while the earlier period of anderson localization was mostly devoted to study of the scaling behavior of the localization or correlation length as a function of proximity to the mobility edge @xmath14 or to critical disorder @xmath15 , the notion of multifractality of random critical single - particle wave function @xmath16 was introduced by wegner @xcite almost immediately after the formulation of the scaling theory of anderson transition .",
    "the definition was given in terms of the inverse participation ratio and its moments : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes disorder average , @xmath19 is the size of the system and @xmath20 are the _ fractal dimensions_. eq.([def - frac ] ) covers all the three possible phases .",
    "the metal phase is characterized by the wave functions which occupy all the available volume with @xmath21 by normalization . in this case one",
    "immediately concludes from eq.([def - frac ] ) that all @xmath20 are equal to the space dimensionality @xmath22 . in the anderson insulator @xmath23",
    "is of the order of @xmath24 with the probability @xmath25 for a point @xmath26 to fall inside the localization volume @xmath27 , and is very small otherwise with the overwhelming probability @xmath28 .",
    "thus the leading term in eq.([def - frac ] ) at large @xmath19 is of the order of @xmath29 and hence it is independent of @xmath19 , which formally corresponds to all @xmath30 . in the critical region close to the anderson transition",
    "the set of critical exponents @xmath20 is the an important and non - trivial characteristic of this transition , in addition to the well known exponent @xmath31 of the localization length @xmath32 so that the volume in space @xmath33 where the amplitude @xmath34 scales like @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "this approach explicitly takes into account the main feature of multifractality : the hierarchy of regions in space with different scaling of @xmath37 with the system size , each region being a fractal of the hausdorf dimension @xmath38 . with this definition",
    "we have for the integral of eq.([def - frac ] ) : @xmath39 by doing this integral in the saddle - point approximation valid at large @xmath40 one concludes that the quantity @xmath41 and @xmath38 are related by the legendre transformation : @xmath42 the validity of scaling eq.([def - frac ] ) at the anderson transition point was demonstrated in numerous numerical studies and analytically by @xmath43 expansion @xcite of the nonlinear sigma - model ( weak multifractality @xmath44 ) or by the virial expansion method @xcite ( strong multifractality @xmath45 ) .    for further discussion it is very important to know the correlation of _ two _ single particle wavefunctions with the energies @xmath46 and @xmath47 which determines the matrix element of the local interaction . at the anderson transition point",
    "this matrix element appears to be a power - law function of the energy difference @xmath48 as was conjectured by chalker @xcite , checked by direct diagonalization of the lattice anderson models and critical random matrix ensembles @xcite and finally proven analytically for the critical random matrix ensemble @xcite : @xmath49 where the exponent @xmath50 is closely related @xcite with the fractal dimension @xmath51 : @xmath52    the scaling eq.([chalk]),([mu ] ) in the frequency domain reflects the critical nature of single - particle states near the anderson transition .",
    "however , it is valid well outside the mobility edge .    ) as a function of @xmath48 from direct diagonalization of the 3d anderson model with critical disorder w=16.5 for disorder strength w=2 ( green ) , w=5 ( red ) and w=10 ( blue ) , and different system sizes l=8(diamond),l=16 ( circles),l=20 ( squares ) . at @xmath53 and @xmath54 the critical power - law is well seen for @xmath55.,width=377,height=302 ]    in fig.1 it is shown the result of calculation of the correlation function eq.([chalk ] ) by direct diagonalization of the 3d anderson model in the metallic phase with sub - critical disorder .",
    "one can see that even relatively far from the critical disorder ( @xmath56 ) , at @xmath53 , the power - law critical behavior is well seen .",
    "it is saturated when the @xmath48-dependent `` resolution length '' @xmath57 becomes larger than either the correlation length @xmath58 or the system size @xmath19 . even at disorder as small as @xmath59 the enhancement of @xmath60 given by the factor @xmath61 in eq.([chalk ] )",
    "is quite significant . only at @xmath62 when @xmath63 it disappears , and we reach the limit @xmath64 expected for the extended single particle wavefunctions which occupy all the available space .",
    "such a behavior of the correlation function eq.([chalk ] ) suggests a stricture of the typical single - particle wavefunction at the sub - critical disorder which is sketched in fig.2 .     sets the typical size of the `` fractal region '' where the wavefunction correlations are the same as in the critical state . if the @xmath48-dependent `` resolution length '' @xmath65 is smaller than @xmath66 the critical power law in eq.([chalk ] )",
    "is well seen . for larger resolution length one",
    "observes a saturation in the @xmath48-dependence which is typical of metal .",
    "however , the fact that there are many peaks ( dark regions on the plot)in the wavefunction landscape where the amplitude is pretty high , leads to the enhanced saturation level .",
    "the exception is the case of a very weak disorder when the correlation length @xmath67 is smaller than the size @xmath68 of the `` pixel '' which is only slightly larger than the atomic scale . only in this limit",
    "the anderson theorem may apply .",
    "the similar cartoon holds for the localized states at super - critical disorder . in this case",
    "the amplitude is exponentially small outside the localization radius @xmath66 but has the same fractal structure inside this radius .",
    "that allows to speak about the `` multifractal metal '' and `` multifractal insulator '' @xcite .",
    ", width=377,height=302 ]    it consists of the `` fractal regions '' of the size of the `` correlation radius '' @xmath66 appearing in the scaling theory of localization . inside such regions all the correlations are identical to those in the critical wavefunction . as the energy difference @xmath48 decreases the `` resolution length '' @xmath65 increases and at @xmath69 it exceeds the correlation length @xmath66 . only for such @xmath48 the correlation function eq.([chalk ] ) may show that the state is not critical but extended .",
    "thus @xmath70 marks the onset of saturation in fig.1 for @xmath71 .",
    "it is important that at large @xmath72 all curves in fig.1 merge , in agreement with eq.([chalk ] ) .",
    "this means that for @xmath73 the matrix element @xmath60 is _ enhanced _ compared to the ideal case of totally extended wavefunctions which occupy all the available space without peaks and holes at a scale much larger than the fermi wavelength . in order to better understand the origin of this enhancement",
    "we emphasize that it is caused by the _ inhomogeneity _ of the amplitude @xmath74 in space .",
    "the presence of `` holes '' with very small amplitude in certain regions implies appearance of peaks in other regions , as the integral of the amplitude over entire system of the size @xmath19 is equal to 1 by normalization .",
    "the key point is that the positions of the peaks in two different wave functions are highly correlated for the critical and slightly off - critical states .",
    "contrary to naive expectation , even at large energy difference @xmath48 which is only slightly smaller than the _ upper energy scale for fractality _",
    "@xmath75 ( for the 3d anderson model it is approximately 1/3 of the bandwidth ) , the correlation is pretty high .",
    "this leads to the very slow decay of the matrix element @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) with increasing @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "note that the ultimate reason for such a correlation is the presence of valleys in the random potential .",
    "all the wave functions are the solutions to the schroedinger equation in the _ same _ random potential .",
    "so , the peaks know where they predominantly want to be situated .",
    "yet , the criticality matters , as for localized states the similar correlation is absent , perhaps because there are too many possibilities to arrange a localized state of small localization radius .",
    "this is the reason why eq.([chalk ] ) can be formally extended to ideal metal by setting @xmath78 but it can not be extended to hard insulator which formally corresponds to @xmath79 .",
    "as has been already mentioned in introduction , in the situation when coulomb interaction can be neglected the minimal model consists of the single - particle hamiltonian with disorder and the local attractive interaction @xcite : @xmath80 in the case where disorder is strong it is very useful to switch from the coordinate representation to the representation of the exact single - particle states where all effect of disorder is taken into account @xcite .",
    "this is done as usual by substitution @xmath81 of the @xmath82-operator in terms of the exact single - particle wavefunctions @xmath16 and the creation / annihilation operators @xmath83 and @xmath84 of electrons in the corresponding state @xmath85 with the spin @xmath86 . as the result",
    "the single - particle part of the hamiltonian becomes diagonal but the interaction part produces a variety of terms @xmath87 where @xmath88 these terms may be divided into two major groups .",
    "the first one consists of the terms where all four indices are the same @xmath89 or there are two pairs of equal indices .",
    "the examples are @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as well as @xmath92 .",
    "they do not change the parity of occupation of a single particle state but can only move a singlet pair from state @xmath85 to state @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) or to flip the spin of the singly occupied state ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "all the other terms may convert the singly - occupied state into the empty or doubly occupied states and vise versa .    in the region of localized single - particle states",
    "the largest matrix element is @xmath96 , all the other matrix elements are smaller because different single - particle states rarely overlap . when the matrix element @xmath97 is large enough",
    ", it favors a _ local pair formation _ by producing a gap between the _ even _ many - body states in which all the single - particle states are occupied by a singlet pair or empty , and all other ( _ odd _ ) states . in this case",
    "one may neglect the presence of odd states whatsoever and introduce bosonic operators @xmath98 .",
    "one can easily check that @xmath99 , so that we introduced a _ hard - core _ bosons .",
    "in addition to that , for even states @xmath100 .    the _ minimal model in the fock space _ is obtained by neglecting of all terms except for those proportional to @xmath96 and @xmath101 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian takes the form : @xmath102 it describes physics of local pairs with hard - core interaction attached to single - particle states @xmath85 with random energies @xmath103 and hopping due to the attractive interaction of original electrons .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath96 is included into the chemical potential .",
    "obviously , the hopping favors establishing a delocalized phase which at low enough temperature must be superfluid . disorder , in contrast , is trying to localize the pairs .",
    "eq.([min - fock ] ) admits also a spin representation in which the hard - core nature of bosons is automatically included . to this end",
    "one introduces the spin-@xmath104 operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 $ ] . then eq.([min - fock ] ) takes the form : @xmath107 in this language the ising order corresponds to localized pairs and the @xmath108 order corresponds to a superfluid phase .",
    "so far we neglected the term proportional to @xmath109 which is also operating in the even sector of the hilbert space .",
    "it can be easily taken into account by adding the following term to the hamiltonian : @xmath110 this term describes interaction ( attraction ) of bosons at different points in the fock space .",
    "it favors phase separation with fixed pair occupation number @xmath111 or @xmath112 and thus disfavors establishing a coherent superfluid phase where the occupation number strongly fluctuates .",
    "this has an effect of reducing the superconducting / superfluid transition temperature .",
    "such a suppression of @xmath0 by a factor of order 1 @xcite does not change , however , the main conclusions of this paper .    among other omitted terms the most significant are the following :",
    "@xmath113 which describe dissociation and creation of pairs out of singly occupied single - particle states .",
    "they can be safely neglected in the region of sufficiently strongly localized single - particle states but have to be taken into account in the region of critical and sub - critical states where they determine the ginzburg number @xmath114 .",
    "the minimal model eq.([spin - fock ] ) is a good starting point not only in the region of localized single - particle states ( _ the `` pseudo - gap '' region _ ) but also in the critical and sub - critical region , although in this case its derivation from the minimal model in real space eq.([min ] ) is not justified by a small parameter .",
    "indeed , the standard mean - field treatment of the spin - model eq.([spin - fock ] ) yields the following equation for the critical temperature @xcite : @xmath115 where @xmath60 is given by eq.([chalk ] ) and @xmath116 is the dimensionless attraction constant .    at a weak disorder @xmath117 for @xmath118 and zero otherwise , and one can immediately recognize the standard bcs equation for @xmath0 , albeit with @xmath119 instead of @xmath120 . this is the price of restriction to the odd sector of the hilbert space . in case",
    "when there is no gap between the many - body states of the even and odd sectors , the latter is thermodynamically relevant even if dynamically both sectors are totally decoupled .",
    "we will show , however , that the accuracy of the mean - field approximation on the metallic side close to the anderson localization transition is up to a constant pre - factor of order 1 . with this uncertainty",
    "the difference by a factor of 2 discussed above is beyond the accuracy of the mean - field approach .",
    "let us apply the mean - field equation ( [ mf - cont - tc ] ) to compute the @xmath0 in the critical region . plugging eq.([chalk ] ) in eq.([mf - cont - tc ] ) and making a rescaling @xmath121 , @xmath122 one reduces the problem of @xmath0 to that of the eigenvalue @xmath123 of the dimensionless linear integral operator .",
    "then we immediately conclude that : @xmath124",
    "as is well known , the thermodynamic fluctuations of phase and fluctuation of the local @xmath0 due to disorder restrict the region of validity of the mean - field approximation . to take into account correctly the first effect in the region of _ extended _ single - particle states one needs to include dissociation processes eq.([hybr ] ) . without such processes , for the minimum model in the fock space eq.([spin - fock ] ) , the mean - field approximation is exact in this region , as the matrix element @xmath101 couples to an infinite number of states in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "when dissociation processes are properly accounted for @xcite one arrives at a remarkable result : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the `` fluctuation region '' .",
    "the effects of multifractality cancel out in the @xmath127 number , and it appears to be a universal number of order @xmath111 close to the anderson localization transition @xcite .    in the region of sufficiently strongly localized single - particle states , the @xmath127 number is mainly controlled by the effective coordination number @xmath128 of states coupled by the matrix element @xmath101 in the minimal spin model eq.([spin - fock ] ) .",
    "as one goes away from the anderson transition , this number increases .",
    "one can show @xcite that in this region : @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 are universal numbers of order 1 .",
    "this effect of decreasing of coordination number with increasing disorder invalidates the mean - field approximation at sufficiently strong disorder and finally leads to the superconductor to insulator transition .",
    "note however , that in the vicinity of the anderson transition eq.([gi ] ) holds true .",
    "given the relationship between the ginzburg number and the energy scale @xmath132 associated with the phase rigidity : @xmath133 one concludes that the scale @xmath132 and the mean - field transition temperature @xmath134 given by eq.([crit - tc ] ) differ by a universal factor of order 1 .",
    "this implies that the phase fluctuations may reduce the true superconducting transition temperature by at most a universal factor of order 1 compared to the mean - field result eq.([crit - tc ] ) .",
    "in order to describe the behavior of transition temperature in the region of localized single - particle states where the mean - field approach breaks down , we exploit @xcite the idea of virial expansion applied to the spin - model eq.([spin - fock ] ) . to this end",
    "we analytically express the cooper susceptibility @xmath135 ( the response of the spin @xmath136 to the infinitesimal perturbation @xmath137 ) as a sum of contributions of clusters of @xmath138 coupled spins : @xmath139 the true transition temperature corresponds to temperature @xmath0 when this series becomes divergent . according to dalembert criterion this happens",
    "when : @xmath140 in view of rapid increase of complexity of the analytical expressions for @xmath141 with increasing @xmath138 , we truncated the series eq.([virial ] ) and used the operative definition of @xmath0 in terms of small - cluster contributions @xmath142 and @xmath143 : @xmath144 by evaluating @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 taking the energies @xmath148 and matrix elements @xmath101 from exact diagonalization of the anderson model on a 3d lattice and solving eq.([oper ] ) numerically we were able to find statistics of @xmath142 and @xmath143 at different positions of fermi level relative to the mobility edge .",
    "the average @xmath142 and @xmath143 appear to be in good agreement with each other which gave us a reasonable confidence in the convergence of the procedure .     for the fixed dimensionless constant @xmath149 ( blue circles ) and for the fixed attractive interaction @xmath150(green circles ) , where @xmath151 is the hopping integral of the anderson model .",
    "in the insert : energy dependence of the mean density of states . large energy corresponds to region of localized single - particle states .",
    "inside this region the mean - field ( mf ) transition temperature is substantially larger than that ( @xmath152 ) found from the truncated virial expansion series .",
    "the cooper susceptibilities @xmath153 and @xmath154 were calculated numerically using exact eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the anderson model with strength of disorder @xmath155 , size of system @xmath156 and the debye frequency @xmath157.,width=453,height=377 ]    in fig.3 , the results of virial expansion calculation for the average @xmath158 are presented as a function of the fermi level position .",
    "it is remarkable that the truncated virial expansion method is in good agreement with the results of mean - field calculations in the region of extended and weakly localized states and gives substantially smaller transition temperature for stronger localized single - particle states .",
    "this proves that the virial expansion method , even with only 3 terms retained in the series eq.([dalembert ] ) , captures the decrease of the effective coordination number @xmath128 and is not equivalent to the mean - field approximation .",
    "equation ( [ crit - tc ] ) shows that when the fermi energy is at the mobility edge @xmath159 the critical temperature behaves as a power law of the dimensionless attraction constant @xmath160 .",
    "numerical simulations on the 3d anderson model of localization give ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) the value of the fractal dimension @xmath161 .",
    "thus the exponent in the power law dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath160 is close to @xmath162 . for small",
    "@xmath160 one always has @xmath163 .",
    "in addition to that the characteristic energy @xmath75 is of electronic nature and it is typically higher than the debye frequency @xmath8 .",
    "therefore we conclude that at small @xmath160 the transition temperature given by eq.([crit - tc ] ) is much higher than the bcs transition temperature @xmath164 .",
    "this enhancement of @xmath0 is also obtained by a virial expansion method which is completely independent of the mean - field approach .",
    "it can be easily traced back to the enhancement of the matrix element @xmath101 shown in fig.1 .    in order to figure out",
    "how general is the effect of enhancement of @xmath0 at negligible coulomb interaction , let us consider the case of weak multifractality @xmath165 .",
    "this case is relevant for the 2d metal @xcite , where @xmath166 expanding the matrix element @xmath167 in the mean - field equation eq.([mf - cont - tc ] ) up to the leading correction in @xmath168 @xmath169 we obtain the @xmath168 correction to the transition temperature : @xmath170 we obtained the correction of the same order as in ref.@xcite given by eq.([mayfuk - attrac ] ) thus proving that our analysis at @xmath171 qualitatively applies also to the case of _ weak multifractality _ in 2d metals .",
    "then eq.([mayfuk - coulomb ] ) tells us that the really crucial assumption for enhancement of @xmath0 by disorder is the suppression of coulomb interaction .",
    "recently @xcite this statement was confirmed by the rg analysis of the finkelstein - like nonlinear sigma - model in @xmath172 and @xmath173 where only the short - range interactions were taken into account .",
    "there are certain systems @xcite where one may suspect such a suppression .",
    "moreover , the enhancement of @xmath0 just before the onset of the insulating behavior was observed in one of them with the dependence of @xmath0 on doping highly reminiscent of the fig.3 .",
    "more investigations are needed to confirm or reject this conjecture . in any case , the search for systems with suppressed coulomb interaction ( except for obvious case of cold neutral fermionic atoms with attractive interaction ) is a challenging task which may open a door into a wonderful world without coulomb interaction .",
