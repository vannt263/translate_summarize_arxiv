    "<S> the cross sections for the production of two - pions in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , calculated in the impact parameter equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) , are presented . </S>",
    "<S> differential distributions in impact parameter , dipion invariant mass , single pion and dipion rapidity , pion transverse momentum and pion pseudorapidity are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 subprocess constitutes a background to the @xmath1 process , initiated by emission of a photon by one of colliding nuclei . only a part of the dipion invariant mass distribution associated with the @xmath2-collisions can be visible as the cross section for the @xmath3 reaction is very large .    </S>",
    "<S> differential distributions for two @xmath4 meson production in exclusive ultraperipheral , ultrarelativistic collisions via a double scattering mechanism are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for @xmath5 is parametrized based on a calculation from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> smearing of @xmath4 masses is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the results of calculations are compared to experimental data obtained at rhic and to the contribution of the two - photon mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> the double scattering mechanism populates larger @xmath6 invariant masses and larger rapidity distances between the two @xmath4 mesons compared to the @xmath7 fusion . </S>",
    "<S> it gives a significant contribution to the @xmath8 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> some observables related to charged pions are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculation are compared with the star collaboration results for four charged pion production . </S>",
    "<S> while the shape in invariant mass of the four - pion system is very similar to the measured one , the predicted cross section constitutes only 20 % of the measured one . </S>"
