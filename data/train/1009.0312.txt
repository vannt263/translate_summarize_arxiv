    "the pronounced extension of the synchrotron radio continuum to the x - ray region , not formerly predicted , is now known to be a very common feature among radio jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the crucial point that should be emphasized is that , in many sources , still no clear signs of sharp cut - off are found in the _ chandra _ regime ( e.g. 3c66b : @xcite ; m87 : @xcite ; 3c31 : @xcite ; m84 : @xcite ; 3c346 : @xcite ) , and there is even an implication of the possible appearance of a gamma - ray tail in the synchrotron spectral component .",
    "this fact is of considerable interest , directly related to the challenging issue of how high an energy range electrons could be accelerated up to in situ . in a conventional fashion",
    ", the electron energy distribution is truncated at an assumed highest energy , which could be responsible for the observed spectrum .",
    "independent of such a makeshift solution , however , it is desirous to elaborate on a particle acceleration theory that can naturally account for the extended continuum , with reference to the morphological details innovated by the recent very - long - baseline interferometry survey ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from another point of view , theoretical expansion would also be requisite for corroborating a unified scheme of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "none the less , the related thorough study required to elucidate a universal mechanism underlying the many appearances of the energetic continuum has not been performed as yet .    in a simplistic model assuming a homogeneous magnetic field over a particular system ,",
    "@xcite first considered a combination of small pitch - angle scattering diffusion and fermi - type acceleration of electrons to evaluate the frequency of synchrotron emission from the highest energy electron : @xmath4~{\\rm hz } , \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the shock speed , the speed of light and the ratio of the perturbed to the mean energy density of the global magnetic field , respectively .",
    "although a symptom of cut - off in the range of equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) has been suggested in some earlier publications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the broad - band spectral fitting is now found to , if anything , entail a break followed by the aforementioned high - energy extension , unlike a sharp cutoff .",
    "a clue aiding in achievement of the required higher acceleration efficiency might be the fine structure like filaments inside jets , which can be reconciled with the observational detailed morphology . based on this notion ,",
    "@xcite have investigated the root - mean - square ( rms ) diffusion of electrons in inhomogeneous magnetic fields , and found that the intrinsic frequency of the diffuse synchrotron component could reach as high as @xmath9^{2/3 } \\left(u / c\\right)^{4/3}~{\\rm hz } , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the rms magnetic field strength and transverse correlation length of filaments , respectively .",
    "the relevant argument focusing on the specified case of the nearby m87 jet has been given @xcite , although the value of @xmath11 remained unsolved .",
    "its determination is necessary not only to estimate equation  ( [ eq:2 ] ) but also complete the filamentary jet model , which could involve various radiation channels @xcite .",
    "this paper has been prepared to spell out explicitly the scalings of the cut - off and break for the dominant synchrotron spectrum established via normal ( non - diffuse ) processes in filamentary jets , and to revise equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) , including relativistic beaming effects . making use of the results , we attempt to extract the scaling of the lower limit of the filament correlation length , @xmath12 , from observational data for sample extragalactic jets .",
    "we find the property that the @xmath12 value increases as the size of emission regions increases .",
    "a corollary derived from this is that the allowable maximum number ( capacity ) of filaments with the outer scale ( @xmath13 ) increases as the propagation distance of the jet increases .",
    "for the situation in which agn jets carry huge currents driven by the central engines of black holes @xcite , we take the current filamentation into consideration in order to calculate the number of filaments ( @xmath14 ) . from comparing @xmath14 with the capacity of the outer - scale filaments ,",
    "we infer the population of fine filaments inside the jets . as a result",
    ", it is demonstrated that compact bllac objects such as mrk421 and 501 would possess typically @xmath15 filaments with various transverse size scales that are smaller than the entire emission - region size .",
    "according to the original idea in @xcite , we rely on the hypothesis that a jet consists of many magnetized filaments , accommodated by some radio observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for information ,",
    "the circumstance concerned is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the quasi - stationary magnetic fields are considered to be generated by leptonic currents , and retain an energy - density level comparable to that of the random component of lepton motion @xcite .",
    "it is then expected that the poynting flux level is less than ( or , at most , comparable to ) the lepton energy flux . in respect of the global energy budget , the small portion that takes part in controlling the transverse dynamics ( section  [ sec:5 ] ) is loaded from the energy reservoir of the jet bulk . if the dominant kinetic energy is carried by hadronic components then an excess of lepton energy departing from the mass ratio ( say , @xmath16 per cent for a simple electron ",
    "proton plasma with no pairs ) is entailed in order to generate the currents and magnetic fields , in accord with arguments concering the power of blazar jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the merging of current filaments can be associated with the inverse cascade of turbulent magnetic energy . for the inertial range of the turbulence ,",
    "we invoke the phenomenological expression for local magnetic intensity @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the transverse size of a filament ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) and @xmath20 corresponds to the turbulent spectral index .",
    "as seems plausible , this ( zeroth order ) magnetic field , trapping lower - energy electrons , is disturbed by alfvnic waves to allow resonant scattering diffusion .",
    "also , in analogy to the knot and hotspot features , it is reasonable to suppose a relativistic ( non - relativistic ) shock overtaking the relativistic ( non - relativistic ) flow with the lorentz factor @xmath21 , such that the shock viewed in the upstream rest frame likely has a non-/weakly relativistic speed . providing the fields defined upstream , we consider the standard diffusive acceleration of bound electrons due to the fermi - i mechanism @xcite , which yields a power - law energy distribution ( @xmath22 for @xmath23 ) .",
    "the acceleration time - scale @xmath24 is of the order of the cycle time for one back - and - forth divided by the energy gain per encounter with the shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we here adopt a standard expression for @xmath24 that involves a negligible contribution from particle escape downstream to the cycle time and gain @xcite .",
    "what we deal with below is , therefore , the non - ageing ( or flaring ) regime around the working surface ( a related issue is revisited in section  [ sec:3.1 ] ) .",
    "compatible with this , it is reasonable to suppose that , for major electrons bound to the outer - scale filament with maximum field strength @xmath25 , the acceleration is degraded by strong synchrotron cooling rather than escape losses @xcite .",
    "the synchrotron emission , largely polarized , appears to constitute the dominant radio continuum with a power index of @xmath26 in the flux - density spectrum ( @xmath27 , provided the electron density is uniform , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral break reflects the highest energy of an accelerated electron ( @xmath28 ) at which @xmath24 is comparable to radiative time - scale . from balancing these time - scales , we can analytically derive the maximum lorentz factor , @xmath29 ( along with the guidelines provided in @xcite ) ; for convenience , the generic expression is explicitly written as follows : @xmath30^{1/(3-\\beta^{\\prime } ) } \\left[g(b_{m},d)\\right]^{-(1+\\beta^{\\prime})/(3-\\beta^{\\prime})}. \\label{eq:3}\\ ] ] here , @xmath3 is the energy density ratio of the perturbed / local mean magnetic field of filaments , which is assumed to be a constant smaller than unity : @xmath31 ( checked below ) , @xmath2 is the shock - compression ratio , @xmath32 is the turbulent spectral index of the alfvnic fluctuations ( superimposed on the local mean field ) and the dimensionless functions are defined as @xmath33 where @xmath6 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the speed of light , elementary charge and electron rest mass , respectively .",
    "the observed break frequency can be simply estimated as @xmath36 $ ] , where @xmath37 is the beaming factor . when setting the standard value of @xmath38 ( for kolmogorov turbulence ) , we obtain the scalings @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 in mg and @xmath11 in pc .",
    "note that both equations  ( [ eq:5 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) are independent of @xmath20 .    in filaments smaller than @xmath11",
    ", the bound electrons can be accelerated up to a higher energy , i.e. @xmath44 , owing to the weaker synchrotron loss . while the synchrotron flux density is lower , the power - law tail is retained up to higher frequency ( reflecting the enhanced @xmath45 value ) .",
    "apparently , this property can be responsible for the extended continuum going beyond @xmath46 .",
    "however , the increase in acceleration efficiency ought to be limited at a critical coherent length @xmath47 , below which the transverse escape of electrons dominates the radiative loss . in the escape - dominant regime ,",
    "another @xmath45 scaling is derived from the spatial limit condition , i.e. equating the electron gyroradius @xmath48 with @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a dimensionless factor smaller than unity ( see section  [ sec:2.3 ] ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath51 contains the solution of @xmath52 at which @xmath45 takes a peak value , to give the expression @xmath53 . substituting the @xmath47 expression into the @xmath45 scaling , the critical lorentz factor , defined as @xmath54 ,",

    "note that equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) is independent of @xmath20 . in the ordinary case in which the diffuse emission level is lower ( cf .",
    "the discussion in @xcite ) , equation  ( [ eq:10 ] ) ( instead of equation  [ eq:2 ] ) provides the observed cut - off frequency of the synchrotron radiation , which is of non - diffuse at least in the scale of @xmath62 .",
    "note that the absorption in extragalactic background lights is expected to be insignificant , as long as the radiation frequency is in the range below @xmath63 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      the large @xmath64 value expected in equation  ( [ eq:10 ] )",
    "is owed to the efficient acceleration of electrons bound to the local magnetic fields of filaments with size - scale @xmath62 . in this regime ,",
    "the time - scale of escape from a small - scale filament competes with the radiative loss time - scale , and therefore we provide additional discussions concerning the spatiotemporal property of diffusion loss , in order to identify the value of @xmath50 .",
    "the escape is dominated by diffusion across the magnetic field line permeating through the current filaments , so that for the electrons confined within radial size @xmath65 , the escape time is estimated as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the mean free path ( mfp ) for diffusion perpendicular to the magnetic field line ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recall that the perpendicular diffusion is characterized by the coefficient @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 [ \\lambda/(2r_{g})]^{\\beta^{\\prime}-1}$ ] ( for @xmath72 ) denotes the mfp for the diffusion parallel to the field line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "along with this , we invoke the relation @xmath73 for @xmath74 , which is the region of interest to us , and then the escape time can be expressed as @xmath75 . as a result",
    ", we find that equating @xmath76 to @xmath24 correctly provides the aforementioned spatial limit equation in the form of @xmath77 , where @xmath78 one can ascertain that equation  ( [ eq:11 ] ) is also valid for @xmath79 ( not shown ) . in the strong - shock limit",
    "we have @xmath80 , and suggest that setting @xmath50 to unity is nearly adequate for the simple treatment of escape loss . in the case",
    "in which the mfp related to the diffusion considered is anomalously longer than the estimated range of @xmath67 , the @xmath50 value becomes effectively smaller than that of equation  ( [ eq:11 ] ) ; i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath64 could reduce , even if the inverse compton ( ic ) and redshift effects considered later are negligible . the uncertainty in @xmath50",
    "is expected to cooperate to smear out the actual spectrum around @xmath64 .",
    "there exists another possible effect that prevents electrons from being energized up to the range given in equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "the starlight and dust emission that emanate from host galaxies potentially serve as external targets for the inverse comptonization of accelerated electrons . for relativistic jets",
    ", one may consider these and also the cosmic microwave background , because the radiation energy density is boosted in the comoving frame by a factor of @xmath82 @xcite . particularly in the weaker magnetic intensity regions of @xmath83 , the comoving radiation energy density ( denoted as @xmath84 )",
    "could be comparable to the magnetic energy density , so that the time - scale for thomson scattering loss could compete with that for synchrotron loss .",
    "it is pointed out that similar circumstances can appear even for a synchrotron originator , if the non - local effect is significant for radiative transfer . on the other hand ,",
    "it is unlikely that inverse comptonization affects the lepton energization to the @xmath81 level of equation  ( [ eq:9 ] ) , because the klein - nishina effect tends to reduce the scattering cross - section ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    ", the competition between these conceivable radiative channels is complicated , dependent on the detailed parameters inherent to sources .    with this aspect in mind",
    ", we here simply clarify the maximum level of ic losses that can affect the electron acceleration up to @xmath81 .",
    "for example , one can identify the maximum equivalent ic field ( denoted as @xmath85 ) corresponding to the quantity @xmath86 by conservatively taking the balance of @xmath24 with the thomson time - scale at @xmath81 .",
    "considering the synchrotron limit at @xmath87 , it is found that any ic losses can safely be ignored ( i.e. equations  [ eq:9 ] and [ eq:10 ] are valid ) if @xmath88}. \\label{eq:12}\\ ] ] the criterion for @xmath89 reduces to @xmath90 , which would generally be satisfied . in the following ,",
    "therefore , we are concerned with the negligible contribution of compton losses to the maximum energy analysis , aiming at providing a generic theoretical upper limit on the ( non - diffuse ) synchrotron radiation frequency that has not been manifested so far .",
    "we further expand our discussions on the validity of the scalings of @xmath46 and @xmath64 , in light of the comparison with observational data . in equation  ( [ eq:6 ] )",
    ", we have the @xmath46 scaling apparently proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "however , there is a potential that the correlation length - scale @xmath11 is virtually related to @xmath43 , yielding an explicit magnetic intensity dependence of @xmath46 . to see this , in fig .",

    "section  [ sec:4 ] ) , we preliminarily obtain @xmath98 . in any case",
    ", the resulting magnetic intensity dependence of @xmath46 is thought of as being weak in the present context .",
    "this property appears to be , if it is correct , markedly different from @xmath99 @xcite , which was derived considering the synchrotron cooling of ageing electrons in hot spots @xcite .",
    "we point out that observations provide some support for the classical scaling ( for hotspots ) , implying that the present analytic results can not directly be applied to hotspot phenomena , although the applicability of the filament model as such still remains unclear .    in the synchrotron spectrum ,",
    "the appearance of ageing effects might be pronounced , particularly during the low activity around the working surface , which can be translated as the quenching of turbulent energy injection at the smallest size - scale ( i.e. the largest wavenumber , @xmath100 , in the filamentary turbulent spectrum : * ? ? ?",
    "the inertial inverse cascade will lower the upper cut - off @xmath100 , resulting in a lack of smaller - scale filaments and magnetic energy condensation around the outer scale @xmath13 . when entering into the degenerate regime of @xmath101 , equation  ( [ eq:10 ] )",
    "is violated , and the further cascade leads to the redshift of cut - off frequency moving toward the lower limit compared with the @xmath46 range given in equation  ( [ eq:6 ] ) .",

    "it has been demonstrated that the @xmath64 level could be much higher than the previously suggested one ( equation  [ eq:1 ] ) , consistent with many x - ray measurements .",
    "the expected range of the present break frequency ( equation  [ eq:6 ] ) appears to be comparable to the previous cut - off ( in the nomenclature of earlier literatures ) . in terms of the validity , we have provided extended discussions of the smearing effect on the synchrotron spectrum at @xmath64 , the inverse comptonization effect and the ageing effect , which could involve the degenerative redshift of @xmath64 .    by combining the results obtained with key observational data of agn jets",
    ", we have found the property that the minimum correlation length of filamentary turbulence is larger for larger objects . in particular , we address the issue that the correlation data for compact bl  lacs and fri radio sources are likely aligned in a common scaling , probably reflecting the spatiotemporal evolution of agns .",
    "this trend is amenable to the agn unification scheme , in which the fri sources are envisaged as misaligned bl  lacs . from translating the correlation scaling to the number scaling of filaments",
    ", we could infer how the filaments are packaged in the jet interior , and extract the consequence that the current carrying agn jets must possess many filaments smaller than the entire emission - region size ; e.g. for a pc - scale blazar jet the number of filaments is @xmath15 and more .",
    "the findings , including a constant column magnetic energy density , support the conjecture that agn jets ubiquitously involve filamentary morphology .",
