    "unexpected outbreak of many epidemics in biological systems@xcite and the spread of viruses in technology systems@xcite result in a lot of death or great damage in related systems .",
    "the study of epidemiological models has a long history , especially in the field of social science@xcite .",
    "the sir ( susceptible - infected - removed ) model and the sis ( susceptible - infected - susceptible ) model are two representative models which capture the basic properties of epidemic spreading through the transition among several disease states@xcite . in sir model ,",
    "a susceptible individual will become infected with certain rate when it has contact with infected individuals .",
    "an infected individual will get immunity to the disease or die at some constant rate , and becomes a removed node which means it can not get infected again .",
    "therefore , the spread of disease will terminate when all the infected individuals are removed from the disease .",
    "differently in sis model , there are just two states , susceptible and infected . a recovered individual can get infected again . if the fraction of infected individuals is large enough the disease will spread indefinitely , otherwise it will die out after sometime .",
    "initially , the epidemic models are considered under the homogeneous mixing hypothesis@xcite , in which it assumes that each time an arbitrary individual has an equal opportunity to contact with everyone else in the population .",
    "later , results from network science community demonstrate that most real - world networked systems have heterogeneous topological structures@xcite , and this greatly promote many mathematicians and physicists to explore epidemic models on heterogeneous random networks@xcite by means of mean - field approximation@xcite , generating functions formalism@xcite and percolation theory@xcite .",
    "it was found that for random networks with strongly heterogeneous degree distribution , like many real - world networks , the epidemic threshold is absent , which means epidemics always have a finite probability to survive indefinitely@xcite .",
    "besides of topological properities , traffics in networks also have great impacts on the epidemic spreading .",
    "for instance , in the internet computer viruses transmit from a node to another one with data packets . without transmission of packets",
    ", viruses can not spread even if the two nodes are physically connected .",
    "another example is the air traffics speed the spread of disease among different spatial areas .",
    "the combination between epidemic spread and traffic dynamics were first considered in the metapopulation model@xcite which characterizes the dynamics of systems composed of subpopulations .",
    "then , meloni et al@xcite studied the impact of traffic dynamics on the spread of virus in the internet , in which the information packets are transmitted with the shortest path protocol . later",
    ", many mechanisms were proposed to suppress the traffic - driven epidemic spreading , for instance controlling the traffic flow@xcite , the routing strategy@xcite , or the heterogeneous curing rate@xcite , deleting some particular edges@xcite , etc .",
    "random walk is one of the basic mechanisms related to spreading processes@xcite .",
    "for example , a mobile phone virus may randomly dial some phone numbers from the directory .",
    "some computer viruses propagate randomly by email or other online communication tools .",
    "therefore , the role of random walks in the epidemic spreading should be explored .",
    "we propose an epidemic model driven by biased random walks . in our model ,",
    "an infected node sends infected packets at a constant rate to its neighbor nodes through biased random walks .",
    "a susceptible node gets infected after receive the infected packets , and will be removed from the set of infected nodes with a constant rate .",
    "we inverstigate the spreading dynamics , the optimal control parameter of our model and the influence of network topologies on our model .",
    "we improve the traditional sir model by incorporating the traffic dynamics driven by random walks .",
    "the sir model is one of the traditional epidemic spread models in literature . in the sir model ,",
    "there are three types of nodes including susceptible nodes , infected nodes and removed nodes .",
    "a susceptible node is susceptible to epidemics .",
    "an infected node is already infected by the epidemic .",
    "a recovered node is the one that is removed from the set of infected nodes .",
    "assume the numbers of susceptible , infected and removed nodes at time @xmath0 are denoted as @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "there are three basic elements in the sir model as follows@xcite :    1 .",
    "assume the number of nodes in the network is fixed to @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath5 for all @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   at time @xmath6 , an arbitrary infected node infects the susceptible nodes by a ratio @xmath7",
    ". then the increased number of infected nodes at @xmath8 is @xmath9 .",
    "3 .   at time t",
    ", the number of infected nodes removed is proportional to the total number of infected nodes @xmath10 , which is @xmath11 .    according to the three elements",
    ", the dynamics of the sir model can be expressed as follows@xcite : @xmath12 when time @xmath6 is large enough , all the infected nodes will eventually becomes removed nodes , and the epidemic spreading stops .",
    "the sir model is based on the assumption that a node has equal probability to contact with every other node in a network .",
    "however , in real situations , individuals often have heterogeneous numbers of contacts@xcite .",
    "a few individuals have large number of contacts which will get more contacts according to the `` rich - get - richer '' mechanism , while most of the individuals have a few contacts . especially in the internet , the epidemic can not spread from a node to another node unless there is transport of infected packets between the two nodes .",
    "additionally , in city networks even the cities are physically well connected , an epidemic can not spread among cities unless individuals who get infected by the disease move among the cities .",
    "therefore , epidemics are often correlated with traffics for their spreading .",
    "we consider the traffic dynamics driven by biased random walks in the epidemic spreading process . in our model , each time an infected nodes will delivery constantly @xmath13 infected packets to its neighbor nodes through biased random walks . if an infected or removed node receives the packets , it will drop the packets . if a susceptible node receives the packet , it becomes an infected node and starts delivering infected packets from next time step .",
    "an infected node has the probability @xmath14 to become a removed node .",
    "the transitions among susceptible , infected and removed nodes are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "assume an arbitrary infected node @xmath15 which has @xmath16 neighbor nodes .",
    "@xmath17 is the average node degree of the network .",
    "the degrees of @xmath15 s neighbor nodes are @xmath18 respectively . according to the biased random walk mechanism , for a neighbor node @xmath19 the probability that node @xmath15 sends an infected packet to node @xmath19 is as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the control parameter of the biased random walk . when @xmath22 , all the neighbor nodes have equal opportunity to receive an infected packet delivered from node @xmath15 which means they have equal probability to get infected .",
    "when @xmath23 , nodes of larger degree have larger probability to receive the packet . when @xmath24 , nodes of smaller degree have larger probability to receive the packet .",
    "since @xmath15 send @xmath25 infected packets each time , the probability that node @xmath19 will not receive any packets from node @xmath15 is : @xmath26 assume @xmath27 is an random variable that represents the event that node @xmath19 is infected .",
    "then @xmath28 means node @xmath19 hasnt get any infected packet from node @xmath15 , and node @xmath19 is not infected .",
    "@xmath29 means node @xmath19 has received at least one of the infected packets from node @xmath15 , and node @xmath19 is infected .",
    "then we have : @xmath30 then the expected value of @xmath31 is : @xmath32 assume a random variable @xmath33 that represents the number of neighbor nodes infected by node @xmath15 .",
    "then the average value of @xmath33 is : @xmath34 where the sum is over all the @xmath16 neighbor nodes of node @xmath15 .",
    "however , in the epidemic spreading process the neighbor nodes of node @xmath15 may not be only susceptible nodes .",
    "to effevtively estimate the number of neighbor nodes that node @xmath15 infects , we need to know the number of susceptible nodes among all the neighbor nodes of node @xmath15 . to estimate the total number of new infected nodes at time @xmath6",
    ", we count the ratio @xmath35 of susceptible nodes among neighbor nodes of infected nodes in the network , which is as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of susceptible nodes among the neighbor nodes of an infected node @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 represents the average number of susceptible nodes among all the neighbors of infected nodes at time @xmath6 . according to eq .",
    "6 and eq . 7 , the total new infected nodes at time @xmath6 is : @xmath40 combining eq .",
    "1 with eq . 8 , we get the dynamics equations of our model as follows : @xmath41    , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 vs. @xmath8 for @xmath22 and @xmath42 .",
    "a randomly selected node is set to be infected initially .",
    "delivery capacity of infected nodes is @xmath43 .",
    "the network is generated by the static model@xcite .",
    "the parameters are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47.,width=480,height=288 ]    we study the behaviours of @xmath1 , @xmath10 and r(t ) with increase of time @xmath6 on a large - scale scale - free network . in fig .",
    "2 , @xmath1 decreases abruptly , and then saturates with @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath2 increases with @xmath6 , then decreases with @xmath6 , and finally saturates .",
    "there is a peak of @xmath2 that corresponds to the instantaneous maximum population of infected nodes .",
    "@xmath3 increases abruptly , and then saturates with @xmath8 , which is opposite to @xmath1 . when @xmath6 is large enough , the epidemic spreading process stops , and @xmath3 is number of all the nodes that have ever been infected and removed finally from the disease .",
    "the trends of the curves for biased random walks of @xmath42 are similar with that of simple random walks of @xmath22 . also , the simulation results and the analytical results obtained from eq . 9 are consistent , as shown in fig .",

    "the larger the delivery capacity of an infected node , the more susceptible neighbor nodes an infected node will likely infects each time . when @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "then eq . 9 is reduced as follows : @xmath50 we show simulation results of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 for different value of @xmath25 in fig.3 . clearly , the larger @xmath25 , the faster @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 convergence , and the epidemic spreads .",
    "the larger @xmath25 , the larger population of nodes that has ever been infected which is inferred from s(t ) and r(t ) when @xmath8 is large enough .",
    "the larger @xmath25 , the larger instantaneous population of infected nodes which is indicated from the peak of @xmath2 .    , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 vs. @xmath8 for various @xmath21 .",

    ", ( e ) and ( f ) has 75 , 879 nodes and 508 , 960 edges.,width=499,height=278 ]    the parameter @xmath21 is another key factor in our epidemic model which determines the probability that the neighbors of an infected node get infected when @xmath25 is a limited constant . in fig .",
    "4 , we see that @xmath21 is correlated with the instantaneous maximum number of infected nodes @xmath51 , and the range of the spread that is reflected by the ultimate number of removed nodes @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath42 corresponds to a larger @xmath51 and a larger @xmath52 than @xmath22 and @xmath53 .",
    "this indicates that random walks biased on small - degree nodes favors the epidemic spreading which is hold for the model network and the epinions network , as shown in fig.4 .",

    "12 means that generally the number of nodes that an infected nodes infects in one time step increases with average degree @xmath16 , and tends to @xmath25 , which is further confirmed in fig .",

    "their corresponding optimal parameters @xmath54 are generally negative and decrease with @xmath16 .",
