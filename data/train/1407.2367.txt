    "the lidstone polynomials @xcite were introduced to offer an approximation of sufficient number of times continuously differentiable functions at two points instead of their one point approximation given by taylor polynomials . a classical lidstone interpolation function on the interval @xmath12 $ ] is comprised of a lidstone polynomial for each subinterval arising from a partition of the interval .",

    "we review some basic definitions and results on classical lidstone interpolation that are used in the later sections of the paper . in section [ conslfif ] , for an interpolation data in the euclidean plane @xmath18 ,",
    "the notion of lidstone fif is introduced , its existence is established and a computational method of construction of lidstone fif is developed .",
    "the convergence of lidstone fif and its even order derivatives to the data generating function and its corresponding derivatives are studied in section [ convlfif ] .",
    "to this end , first the continuous dependence of lidstone fif @xmath4 and its even order derivatives on the parameter @xmath19 is established .",
