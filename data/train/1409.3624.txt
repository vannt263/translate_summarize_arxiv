    "by definition , wannier - stark states ( ws - states ) are the eigenstates of a quantum particle in a periodic potential in the presence of a static field @xmath0 . for a simple 1d lattice of the period @xmath1",
    "the spectrum of ws - states is a ladder of energy levels with the level spacing @xmath2 , known as the wannier - stark ladder or the wannier - stark fan .",
    "the equidistant spectrum implies periodic dynamics of the particle which is nothing else as celebrated bloch oscillations ( bos ) . if the lattice period is doubled , bos become a complicated process because of the landau - zener tunneling ( lz - tunneling ) between two subbands that emerge from a single band due to the period doubling . in the past decade bos and lz - tunneling in 1d double - periodic lattices",
    "has attracted much attention in cold atoms physics and photonics thanks to applications to interferometric measurements and as a method for manipulating localized wave - packets @xcite .",
    "the main question we address in this work is how the interband lz - tunneling is encoded in the properties of ws - states .",
    "in fact , since an arbitrary initial quantum state of the system can be expanded over the basis of ws - states , they provide an alternative approach for describing different dynamical phenomena , including lz - tunneling .",
    "the advantages of this alternative approach becomes especially transparent in two - dimensional systems which will be the subject of our subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "thus the present work can be also viewed as a necessary step before proceeding with analysis of ws - states in two - dimensional lattices .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we introduce the model  the tight - binding hamilltonian of a double - periodic lattice and perform preliminary analysis of the wannier - stark spectrum ( ws - spectrum ) .",
    "this analysis reveals two different regions in the parameter space  the cases of weak and strong fields  which are analyzed in detail in sec .",
    "we obtain asymptotic expressions for the ws - spectrum in the limit @xmath3 and @xmath4 and discuss two analytical methods that describe this spectrum for intermediate @xmath0 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we analyze the system beyond the tight - binding approximation to see effects which are neglected by this .",
    "the main results are summarized in the concluding sec .",
    "within the tight - binding approximation an arbitrary double - periodic lattice is characterized by four parameters  alternating tunneling elements @xmath5 and @xmath6 , alternating on - site energies @xmath7 , and the stark energy @xmath0 ( we set the distance @xmath1 between the nearest sites to unity ) . for @xmath8",
    "the spectrum of the system consists of two bloch bands , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the quasimomentum defined in the reduced brillouin zone , @xmath11 . in what follows we",
    "shall be mainly concerned with two cases : ( i ) @xmath12 yet @xmath13 ; ( ii ) @xmath14 yet @xmath15 .",
    "these two lattices can have almost indistinguishable bloch spectrum , see fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , however , their bloch states are profoundly different .",
    "in fact , the bloch states of the lattice ( ii ) , known in the solid state physics as the ssh - lattice @xcite , possess nontrivial topological properties reflected in the quantized zak phase @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the case ( i ) corresponds to a topologically trivial lattice .",
    "we mention in passing that recently the zak phase has been measured in cold - atom implementation of the ssh - lattice @xcite .    if @xmath16 the continuous bloch spectrum ( [ 1 ] ) transforms into the discrete ws - spectrum . for the sake of preliminary analysis",
    "we calculate the spectrum using the straightforward diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix . denoting the occupation probabilities for sites @xmath17 and @xmath18 by @xmath19 ( here index @xmath20 labels elementary cells consisting of two sites ) , we have the stationary schrdingier equation for the tilted double - periodic lattice in the form @xmath21 where the stark term corresponds to the potential energy @xmath22 with @xmath23 chosen in the middle between @xmath17 and @xmath18 sites .",

    "[ fig3 ] where we scale the spectrum according to the ladder spacing @xmath0 .",

    "we note that , even if an avoided crossing is not resolved on the scale of the figure , we can indicate its presence sorting the level according to their stability .",

    "we analyzed the energy spectrum of a quantum particle in a 1d double - periodic lattice in the presence of a static field @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that in the limit of weak fields the spectrum consists of two wannier - stark ladders originated from two bloch subbands .",
    "each of these ladders is proved to be uniquely characterized by two parameters  the mean energy and geometrical ( zak ) phase of the bloch subbands .",
    "an additional characteristic of the spectrum is the size of the gap of the avoided crossings between energy levels associated with two different ladders .",
    "these avoided crossings occur at certain values of @xmath0 and correspond to resonant interband landau - zenner tunneling .",
    "as @xmath0 is decreased , the gap of the avoided crossings exponentially decreases . in the opposite case , when @xmath0 is increased , the gaps progressively increase and sooner or latter become comparable with the ladder step .",
    "this results in rearrangement of the spectrum from a superposition of two ladders with the step @xmath122 into a single ladder with the step @xmath2 ( here @xmath1 is the distance between the nearest sites ) . by mapping the problem to an effective two - level system we derived analytic expressions that describe this rearrangement of the spectrum .",
    "remarkably , for one of considered in the work lattices this effective system coincides with the driven two - level system in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "thus we demonstrated that the latter problem , which is of large importance in quantum optics , can be viewed as a particular case of the wannier - stark problem for double - periodic lattices .",
    "finally , we analyzed the wannier - stark spectrum of a quantum particle in a double - periodic lattice beyond the tight - binding two - band approximation .",
