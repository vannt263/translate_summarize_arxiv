    "the investigation of the current noise properties provides an important tool to gain additional information on electric systems .",
    "a standard measure of the noise is the fano factor @xmath0 which is defined as the ratio of the current noise spectral density @xmath1 and the full poisson noise @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the average current driven through the well .",
    "thus the fano factor @xmath4 is smaller than one for sub - poissonian noise and exceeds one for super - poissonian noise . in this work we present theoretical results for the fano factor of a resonant double barrier with the macroscopic cross - section and investigate the transition from _",
    "sub_-poissonian noise to _ super_-poissonian noise .",
    "an early experiment of li _",
    "et al_@xcite focused on the suppression of the noise power below the poisson value .",
    "already in this work it was noticed that the fano factor increases from the suppressed values in the voltage range of positive differential conductance ( pdc ) as the range of negative differential conductance ( ndc ) is approached .",
    "experiments by brown@xcite and iannaccone _",
    "et al_@xcite showed that in the ndc range , the current noise increases even above the poisson value , and is thus described by a fano factor exceeding one .",
    "recently , kuznetsov _",
    "et al_@xcite have presented a detailed investigation of the noise oscillations from sub - poissonian to super - poissonian values of a resonant quantum well in the presence of a parallel magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field leads to multiple voltage ranges of ndc and permits a clear demonstration of the effect .",
    "below we present a theory which describes the transition from sub - poissonian @xmath5 to super - poissonian noise @xmath6 .",
    "our approach treats the fluctuations of the potential and the charge in the well .",
    "the theory describes the transition from sub - poissonian noise to super - poissonian noise at large voltages . at smaller voltages",
    "it gives either an additional suppression of the noise power or an enhancement of the noise power compared to theories which neglect the potential fluctuations .",
    "we find that a new quantity , an energy @xmath7 , enters the fano factor .",
    "the energy @xmath7 is a measure of the sensitivity of the noise to a collective charge and current response generated by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the interaction energy @xmath7 is determined by the response of the average current @xmath8 to a variation of the electrostatic potential @xmath9 in the well @xmath10 and by the response of the charge @xmath11 to the potential in the well .",
    "@xmath12 has the dimension of capacitance .",
    "it is positive in the pdc range , giving rise to screening of excess charges , and becomes negative as the ndc range is approached , corresponding to _ overscreening _ of excess charges . for a double barrier with a geometrical capacitance @xmath13 across the left barrier and a geometrical capacitance @xmath14 across the right barrier we find an interaction energy @xmath15 note that @xmath16 has the dimension of a conductance .",
    "the interaction energy thus has the form of a dimensionless conductance @xmath17 multiplied by an effective charging energy of the well @xmath18 . in the ndc range",
    "the charging energy grows and leads to a very large interaction energy @xmath7 . for a resonant level characterized by decay widths @xmath19 through the left and right barrier , an asymmetry @xmath20 , and a total width @xmath21",
    ", we find a fano factor given by @xmath22 note that the escape rates @xmath19 are positive quantities but @xmath7 and @xmath23 can have either sign .",
    "for a symmetric double barrier the sign of @xmath24 is independent of the applied voltage . however , as will be shown in this work , for any barrier @xmath7 changes sign as a function of voltage : it is negative in the stable part of the i - v - characteristic and becomes positive and large in the ndc part of the i - v characteristic .",
    "if @xmath7 is set to zero in eq .",
    "( [ fano1 ] ) , the fano factor for non - interacting electrons of chen and ting@xcite is recovered .",
    "this result is a consequence of partition noise : an electron scattered at an obstacle with transmission probability t can only be either transmitted or reflected .",
    "the partition noise@xcite gives rise to shot noise proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "for a resonant tunneling barrier@xcite , using the breit - wigner expression for the transmission probability , this leads immediately to the fano factor , eq .",
    "( [ fano1 ] ) with @xmath26 . for @xmath26",
    "the fano factor is minimal ( equal to @xmath27 ) if the two barriers lead to equal escape rates @xmath28 and the fano factor is maximal ( with a value of @xmath29 ) , if the double barrier structure is very asymmetric , @xmath30 .",
    "the lower limit @xmath27 is obtained , independent of whether transmission is a quantum mechanical , fully coherent process or a sequential two step process without phase coherence@xcite .",
    "this maximal suppression is also obtained in the presence of a magnetic field ( see ref . ) .",
    "on the other hand , models with internal degrees of freedom@xcite can give rise to a noise suppression slightly below @xmath31 if the internal degrees of freedom couple also to the reservoirs .    our result , eq .",
    "( [ fano1 ] ) , also has a fano factor of @xmath32 as a lower limit .",
    "however , depending on the asymmetry , at low voltages our theory predicts either a reduction or enhancement of the fano factor compared to a free - electron theory .",
    "a negative @xmath7 arises if an increase of the internal voltage @xmath9 decreases the current through the well .",
    "this is the case in the stable range of the i - v characteristic : a charging of the well is counteracted by the coulomb interaction which creates a positive potential response which in turn drives the resonant level further up in energy .",
    "this leads to a coulomb induced correction of the fano factor for a resonant double well even at low voltages .    as the range of the ndc",
    "is approached , the interaction energy @xmath7 changes sign and becomes positive to such a degree that it completely dominates the fano factor .",
    "this large increase is again due to the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , now we are in a range where the average charge increases in response to a positive variation of the internal voltage .",
    "a charge injected into the well creates a fluctuation of the internal potential which causes even more charge to flow into the well .",
    "thus the current fluctuations are magnified and give rise to a fano factor which exceeds the poisson value .",
    "large fluctuations are commonly expected near equilibrium or non - equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "the analogy of the far from equilibrium current instabilities with equilibrium phase transitions was the subject of work by pytte and thomas@xcite .",
    "these authors investigated the critical slowing down of dielectric relaxation modes at a bulk current instability ( gunn effect ) .",
    "subsequent work by bttiker and thomas@xcite analyzed a one band - current instability ( superlattice ) and discussed in addition to the dielectric relaxation modes also the modes which arise due to the coupling of the current fluctuations to the magnetic field . in this work",
    "we investigate the resonant well under the condition of complete external voltage control and take into account the electrostatic but not the magnetic part of the coulomb interaction .",
    "there are two theoretical works@xcite which also indicate fano factors in excess of the poisson value .",
    "however , these works do not include the partition noise .",
    "instead , it is assumed that the incident current on the cathode side is fully poissonian but that the transmitted and reflected carrier streams are modified through the current dependence of the transmission probabilities .",
    "our theory takes as the basic noise source the partition noise and treats the associated charge fluctuations self - consistently . to treat the potential fluctuations",
    ", we evaluate the off - diagonal elements of a potential operator of the well .",
    "in contrast , ref . does not treat potential fluctuations and ref .",
    "includes self - consistent effects only on the level of probabilities .",
    "these works@xcite also predict in the pdc range fano factors lower than @xmath27 .",
    "such low fano factors have been observed in the recent experiment by kuznetsov _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "however , since in refs .",
    "an essential source of noise , the partition noise , which gives raise to the minimal fano factor @xmath33 in the non - interacting case , is absent , it is perhaps not surprising that lower noise limits are predicted than by our theory .",
    "below we present a self - consistent , analytical calculation of transport properties of resonant tunneling quantum wells in the limit when the total decay width of the resonant state is lower than all other energy scales of the problem .",
    "we consider the zero - temperature case and use the system of units with @xmath34 .",
    "we continue to use the expression `` shot noise '' even in the case when the noise is dominated by interaction .",
    "we emphasize , that in this case , we deal not with single independent electrons traversing the conductor , but with a collective response of many electrons .",
    "the term `` shot noise '' underlines here that the basic source of noise is the partition noise , independent of the degree of interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the self - consistency equation and solve it for the average quantities . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the average current .",
    "the results of these two sections by themselves are not new , and similar discussion can be found in the literature ( see _ e.g. _ ref . ) .",
    "however , they are necessary for the subsequent calculation of the current - current fluctuations . this calculation is performed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v we present the conclusions and discuss in more detail the conditions of validity of our theory .",
    "we consider a quantum well@xcite extended in the @xmath35 and @xmath36-directions ( to be denoted as @xmath37 ) with the area @xmath38 .",
    "the potential profile in the @xmath39-direction is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we assume that the longitudinal and the transverse motion of the electrons are separable . the motion in the @xmath39-direction is quantized , and there exists a set of resonant levels with energies @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the transverse motion is described by a continuum of momenta @xmath42 .",
    "thus the expression for the total energy ( measured from the band bottom of the well ) is @xmath43 the density of states in the well can be factorized into longitudinal and transverse parts , @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the the two - dimensional density of states ( per spin ) .    for interacting electrons the band bottom of the well @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) ) is not an independent quantity but must be found from a self - consistency equation . in the present work ,",
    "we account for the interaction by including the energy required to charge the well .",
    "we introduce the capacitances @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the left and the right barrier , respectively .",
    "the charge allowed in the well by the coulomb interaction is then determined by these capacitances and the voltage drop across the left barrier @xmath47 and across the right barrier @xmath48 .",
    "here @xmath49 is the voltage applied across the double barrier structure .",

    ", we describe scattering at the double barrier in the breit - wigner limit . in particular ,",
    "the longitudinal density of states is @xmath54 here we have introduced the total width of a single resonance @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 being the partial widths for decay through the left and right barrier , respectively .",
    "the breit - wigner limit is appropriate in the limit of small tunneling probabilities through the two barriers and provides an excellent description as long as the resonant level is not in the immediate vicinity of the band bottom of any reservoir , @xmath58 .    in the standard application of the breit - wigner expression",
    "the partial width is independent of energy ; for energies @xmath59 close to the resonant state with energy @xmath40 the width is evaluated at the energy of the resonant state , @xmath60 . here , in order to describe the density of states in the limit where the resonant level approaches the conduction band bottom , we consider the decay widths to be energy dependent .",
    "we determine the energy dependence by considering the quantum - mechanical problem of transmission through a single rectangular barrier .",

    "( [ charge1 ] ) gives the total charge in the well in terms of the carriers injected from each reservoir .",
    "to proceed we now specify two additional conditions :    \\(i ) of all longitudinal energy levels only @xmath70 is relevant , all others lie too high .",

    "note that the onset of the super - poissonian noise ( the voltage where @xmath189=1 $ ] ) is unrelated to the point of zero differential resistance ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "of course , these two points may lie quite close to each other .",
    "in addition , the quantity @xmath167 changes sign from negative to positive when the voltage approaches @xmath92 .",
    "this implies that @xmath7 also changes sign from negative to positive at the same voltage .",
    "finally , with respect to the role of interactions , two scenarios emerge : to avoid cumbersome expressions , we perform the analysis for the symmetric case @xmath171 , @xmath191 . then for `` weak interactions '' , @xmath192 we have @xmath193 .",
    "thus , the curves @xmath194 and @xmath195 cross each other only once , when @xmath196 .",
    "this means that interactions suppress the shot noise for `` low '' voltages and enhance it for `` high '' voltages , eventually driving the noise power to super - poissonian values for voltages close to @xmath92 .",
    "for `` strong interactions '' , @xmath197 , we obtain @xmath198 , and the curves cross each other twice . in this case",
    ", interactions first enhance the shot noise , then suppress it , and then enhance it again . in the limiting case @xmath199 one",
    "has @xmath200 ; then the shot noise starts from the poissonian value .",
    "5a and fig .",
    "5b represent the `` strong interaction '' scenario .",
    "5d illustrates the case of `` weak interactions '' , while fig .",
    "5c shows the marginal case @xmath201 , where one has @xmath202 .",
    "we now discuss the assumptions we made in the course of the derivation of our result , eq .",
    "( [ fano1 ] ) .",
    "first , in order to calculate the shot noise , we linearized the charge and current operators in the fluctuations of the band bottom .",
    "close to the voltage @xmath92 , at the linear stability threshold , where the solutions corresponding to the charged well vanish , these fluctuations become large , and the linearization is not justified any more . since we evaluate only the zero - frequency response , the quantity @xmath203 is not amenable to our treatment , and the limits of this approximation can not be determined .",
    "we emphasize , that in the crossover region from sub- to super - poissonian noise our approach is well justified .",
    "thus , our discussion can be used to determine the range of voltages in which super - poissonian noise can be observed .    to determine the effect of interactions on the fano factor , we have neglected the finite width of the resonant level in the evaluation of @xmath7 . for comparison with experiment the broadening of the resonant level ( finite @xmath204 )",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "this would smear all the curves ; in particular , the noise power at @xmath205 would acquire a finite value .",
    "moreover , if the tunneling rate @xmath204 exceeds the hysteresis interval @xmath108 , an extended range of differential resistance will be observed instead of the hysteretic behavior .",
    "we believe that is the case in the experiments of ref . .",
    "note also that in our treatment the interactions make the fano factor discontinuous at @xmath104 , where it jumps from the non - interacting value@xcite @xmath206 to the renormalized one @xmath207 .",
    "this discontinuity is also healed by the introduction of the finite width of the resonant level .    in our work",
    "we have treated a single resonant level .",
    "it is clear that wells which permit to fill a number of subbands can be expected to exhibit even richer behavior than indicated in this work .",
    "since interactions play a dominant role in the wide area resonant double barrier structure considered here , it might be interesting to analyze the noise power of a single discrete level in a quantum dot under high bias and ask if in fact a similar behavior results .",
    "it would also be interesting to investigate the effect of potential fluctuations not only in the well but also in the accumulation and depletion layers in the cathode and anode . in the terminology of ref .",
    "we have in such a model internal degrees of the well which couple to the cathode .",
    "this would modify the current injection into the well ( depending on the charge state ) and possibly provides a mechanism which can lead to fano factors smaller than @xmath208 .    in conclusion , we investigated current - voltage characteristics and noise power in resonant tunneling quantum wells in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we treated the low - transparency case , when the total width @xmath204 , due to tunneling , is much lower than all other relevant energy scales .",
    "( for the evaluation of the interaction effects , we have taken the transmission coefficient as delta - function in energy ) .",
    "the interaction is taken into account via the charge accumulated in the well due to capacitive coupling to the reservoirs .",
    "in this regime , we discovered that interactions dramatically affect transport properties of the quantum well .",
    "they produce a range of voltages ( @xmath87 ) where the well can be in one of two stable states , which correspond to a charged well and an uncharged well , respectively . for the current - voltage characteristics ,",
    "this leads to a hysteretic behavior , as shown in fig .  4 .",
    "interaction effects are even more pronounced in the noise power : at low voltages interactions can either suppress or enhance the noise power below or above the shot noise level predicted by a free - electron theory , and at large voltages the noise power diverges as @xmath209 for @xmath142 , and becomes super - poissonian close to @xmath92 .",
    "both the noise suppression below the non - interacting value@xcite and the strong enhancement of the noise to super - poissonian values@xcite have been observed experimentally .",
    "we stress that the range of super - poissonian noise is generally different from the negative differential resistance range , and may extend well outside the hysteresis range ( see the example shown in fig .",
    "we believe that our results provide an explanation of the role of interactions on the shot noise in resonant wells",
    ".    clearly , the interaction effects in the noise power which we have discussed are very interesting . while the search for interaction effects in mesoscopic physics represents a huge effort , there are up to now , at best very few clearly identified signatures for which both experiments and theory agree .",
    "a notable exception are of course the coulomb blockade effects .",
    "we emphasize that the effects discussed here , occur in a state which is a far from equilibrium transport state .",
    "resonant tunneling systems have the important advantage that they represent , at least conceptually , a very simple system and thus provide a unique testing ground for both theories and experiments .",
