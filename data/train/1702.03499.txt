    "in recent years , the synthesis of electron wave packets of short duration has attracted a lot of attention due to its applications in ultrafast electron diffraction , crystallography , and microscopy  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that femtosecond electron pulses can be used to image complex molecular , biological , and crystalline structures with very short temporal resolution .",
    "therefore , it has become possible to observe transient molecular structures in the course of chemical reactions  @xcite , gather an insight into melting and heating processes  @xcite , or to observe phase transitions in crystalline and polycrystalline materials  @xcite .",
    "typically , short electron wave packets are produced by shining laser pulses of short duration upon flat photocathodes  @xcite or sharp metallic tips  @xcite .",
    "other techniques include electron emission and acceleration in intense plasmon fields  @xcite , and photoemission from supercooled atoms in optical traps  @xcite .",
    "photoelectrons obtained by these methods appear in vacuum with certain velocity distributions and need to be accelerated up to energies appropriate for microscopy or diffraction . during acceleration and posterior free - propagation , the wave packets spread in time .",
    "additionally , if the short pulses contain several electrons , coulomb repulsion among them contributes importantly to the temporal broadening  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to avoid space - charge effects , synthesis of ultrashort pulses consisting of single electrons has been considered  @xcite .    the shortest single electron pulses with a full width at half maximum duration of 28  fs have been demonstrated recently  @xcite .",
    "moreover , various proposals for further compression of these pulses to attosecond durations have been put forward  @xcite . at this point , it is also important to note that theoretical investigations of scattering processes employing attosecond electron pulses have confirmed their ability to image electronic motions in target atoms and molecules  @xcite .",
    "yet , another proposal for producing attosecond electron pulses has been introduced in  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that very short electron bunches , with energies of few kev , can be produced by the interaction of hydrogen - like ions with intense circularly - polarized laser fields . in this case ,",
    "a broad structure located at the high - energy portion of the photoelectron spectrum is formed ( see , also ref .",
    "this structure , the so - called supercontinuum , is characterized by the absence of multiphoton interferences .",
    "moreover , it does not present significant fluctuations of probability in the range of tens to hundreds single - photon energies and , according to the space - time analysis , can be used to obtain electron pulses with attosecond duration .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to further analyze the properties of the supercontinuum in photoionization and its application to the generation of attosecond electron wave packets .",
    "first , we show that the photoelectron energy spectra can exhibit not just one , but two well - defined interference - free structures at different photoelectron kinetic energies . for the laser field parameters considered here and for the fixed electron detection angles ,",
    "the high - energy structure is approximately two orders of magnitude more pronounced than the mid - energy one and , hence , it contributes the most to the energy - integrated probability distribution at fixed angles .",
    "next , we show that this structure can be used to synthesize attosecond electron pulses .",
    "as we demonstrate , the time duration of the resulting electron pulses can be shortened by increasing the intensity of the laser field which drives ionization .",
    "in contrast to our previous works  @xcite , we consider here ionization stimulated by low - frequency laser fields .",
    "this has been motivated by the fact that such fields , with high intensities and short durations , will soon be available in laser facilities such as extreme light infrustructure ( eli )  @xcite or exawatt center for extreme light studies ( xcels )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it appears beneficial to use low - frequency incident laser fields in the context of electron pulse generation .",
    "the point is that , if we fix the laser field intensity , the lower its frequency the more energetic photoelectrons will be detected ( since the ponderomotive energy of electron oscillations in a laser field increases ) .",
    "this , in turn , will lead to the synthesis of shorter electron pulses",
    ".    we would like to point out that the synthesis of attosecond electron pulses from the above - mentioned high - energy supercontinuum may have at least two advantages .",
    "first , the detected photoelectrons have velocities appropriate for ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction , which makes their further acceleration unnecessary .",
    "second , those photoelectrons are observed within a narrow angular window and , depending on the actual size of the final electron beam , additional collimation methods might be less needed .",
    "note , however , that ultrashort electron wave packets have large energy bandwidths , as a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle .",
    "it is , therefore , expected that nonrelativistic short electron pulses spread fast in time during free propagation .",
    "this is not the case for wave packets synthesized with relativistic kinetic energies ( close to mev ) , as their natural spreading is generally slower .",
    "we show here that very energetic photoelectrons can actually be obtained by employing laser fields of larger intensity .",
    "nevertheless , for electron microscopy applications , standard compression techniques can also be applied  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ionization_probability_distribution ] , for convenience of the reader , we present the formulas of the photoionization probability distributions under the scope of the relativistic strong - field approximation and the plane - wave front approximation .",

    "it is also expected that @xmath222 is the largest for the most energetic photoelectrons .",
    "our space - time analysis presented above shows that @xmath222 does not exceed @xmath223 for the time - averaged intensity @xmath203 , and that it decreases for smaller intensities .",
    "hence , @xmath224 in the current example , @xmath222 is smaller than the space - size of the laser focus by at least two orders of magnitude , provided that the total power of the pulse is around 10pw .",

    ", we can extend the validity of the plane - wave - front approximation by designing the laser focus which is not cylindrically symmetric but is elongated in a particular direction .",

    "in addition to our earlier works  @xcite , we have demonstrated a possibility of generating multiple supercontinua in the energy spectra of photoelectrons .",
    "this is possible using relativistically intense laser pulses of circular polarization .",
    "such intense pulses result in producing very energetic photoelectrons , whose final kinetic energy is practically determined by the ponderomotive energy that they acquire from the laser field at the moment of ionization .",
    "specifically , for the parameters used in this paper , we have shown that two supercontinua spanning the electron kinetic energies of kev and tens of kev are produced . since the properties of a single supercontinuum were already studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have focused here on analyzing the conditions for observing the second supercontinuum .    as it has turned out , the high - energy supercontinuum is created in a very small polar - angular window .",
    "moreover , it can be shifted towards even larger kinetic energies if one applies a more intense driving pulse . in this case , also its bandwidth increases .",
    "as we have shown , this high - energy broad structure can lead to synthesis of attosecond electron pulses .",
    "in general , photoelectron energy distributions crucially depend on the incident laser pulse parameters such as the frequency , number of cycles , polarization properties , etc .",
    "this is also clear when comparing the results presented in  @xcite and in the current paper . in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have studied ionization by the high - frequency laser pulse and we have observed , for instance , that the resulting high - energy lobes in the photoelectron energy spectrum are comparable in magnitude with the low - energy structures . on contrary , for a small - frequency laser pulse considered in this paper ,",
    "the corresponding low - energy structures are dramatically suppressed . when it comes to the position of supercontinua ,",
    "they are determined by the temporal ponderomotive energy . as we show in this paper , their positions scale linearly with the temporal ponderomotive energy .",
    "if we fix the averaged intensity of the laser pulse , the ponderomotive energy will be larger for smaller pulse frequencies , pushing the supercontinua towards higher photoelectron energies .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the most favorable conditions for the generation of high - energy supercontinuum and , hence , attosecond electron pulses are met for low - frequency laser fields .",
    "in closing we note that , if ionization is driven by a finite train of laser pulses , one can expect to generate a finite sequence of electron pulses , similarly to the coherent combs investigated for the thomson and compton  @xcite , and for the breit - wheeler processes  @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that interference effects related to ionization assisted by two ( or more ) laser pulses of different shapes and arbitrarily delayed with respect to each other ( similar to the ones studied in  @xcite for the breit - wheeler process ) can be also explored in the present context .",
    "thus , ionization by relativistically intense laser pulses or by their trains can be used to engineer coherent electron pulses that are arbitrarily delayed and have different intensities .",
    "as the central energy of electron wave packets scales linearly with the time - averaged laser intensity , the generation of coherent electron beams in the mev region can , in principle , be achieved in eli and xcels  @xcite . in this context , the compton effect studied theoretically in ref .",
    "@xcite can be also investigated experimentally . moreover",
