    "the observations of sne of type ia @xcite@xcite , showing that the universe has probably recently entered on a phase of acceleration , raised up a renewal of interest in the cosmological constant ( cc ) problem @xcite @xcite .    since then an increasing number of observational evidences for such an acceleration has been settled .",
    "this acceleration together with other cosmological indicators such as the flatness ( @xmath7 ) from the cmb anisotropies observed by boomerang , proxima and wmap @xcite , the present values @xmath8 by the hst key project @xcite , @xmath9 and @xmath10 by observations of the light elements , sbbn and cluster baryon fraction from x - ray emission @xcite ) , led to the so - called  concordance model \" @xcite based on the @xmath11cdm model .",
    "this model is the simplest improvement of the old standard cosmological model ( including inflation ) .",
    "more precisely , the simplest theoretical candidate explaining this accelerated expansion is a cosmological constant @xmath12 , or some component , called dark energy ( de ) : any term in the energy - momentum tensor which can produce the same negative pressure , such as a scalar field @xcite , called quintessence @xcite , or a bulk viscosity @xcite .",
    "however , the re - introduction of the cc @xmath12 leads to new intriguing puzzles .",
    "particularly , we have to face the old cc problem : the discrepancy between the predictions of the effective quantum fields theory concerning the large vacuum energy density and the tiny upper limits observed in astrophysics for the cc .",
    "besides , it gives rise to a new issue , the so - called  coincidence problem \" , where one has to explain why the cc starts recently to dominate the matter .",
    "assuming @xmath13 , it can only be solved by an unsatisfying fine - tuning .",
    "finally , the introduction of @xmath14 needs also to be conciliated with the inflation in the early universe .    in these conditions",
    ", we have to improve the @xmath15 model in order to solve these puzzling issues .",
    "therefore , we propose a @xmath16 model , namely the simplest modification of the @xmath15 model which allows the best account of the theoretical expectations and the observed data .",
    "some  ansatze \" were already proposed to solve the cc problem before the discovery of the present universe acceleration ( for a review , see @xcite ) . by contrast , the present model , namely the event horizon thermodynamics ( eht ) model , is derived from a thermodynamical approach and not based on an ad hoc hypothesis for the law @xmath17 .",
    "such a phenomenological model is an indispensable preliminary to outline the main laws that any further treatment at the statistical or / and quantum level will have to reproduce , as for example the stefan s law has guided the planck law s advent for the black body radiation .",
    "we thus proposed a model with a variable vacuum energy density @xcite@xcite , based on the generalization of the thermodynamics of the black hole event horizons ( bh e.h.)@xcite to the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker event horizons ( flrw e.h.)@xcite .",
    "this model allows to reconstitute the entire evolution from the early inflation to late acceleration ( for another approach , see also @xcite ) .    in this article , we extend this phenomenological model by introducing a logarithmic correction in the @xmath11-entropy . such a corrective term in the entropy",
    "was recently computed for the entropy of any thermodynamical system and applied to black hole by s.das et al .",
    "@xcite . this correction due to statistical fluctuations around an equilibrium state has an universal character . as the cosmological flrw e.h .",
    "presents notable thermodynamical analogies with the bh e.h .",
    "( albeit some differences article15 ) , we examine the effects of the introduction of this new term in the @xmath16 model .",
    "it appears that the derived expression for @xmath18 , with @xmath19 the radius of the event horizon ( e.h . ) , can then be naturally interpreted as a renormalisation relation and allows to describe the main observed features of the evolution of the universe . in this scheme ,",
    "the obtained universe is initially submitted to a local phase of de sitter inflation ( @xmath20 ) . the vacuum density parameter begins to decrease and there is a graceful exit of inflation .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 passes through a small minimum , then grows again , which allows to solve the  coincidence problem \" .",
    "it tends asymptotically to a de sitter universe . at any instant @xmath22 , @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath23 are decreasing functions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we set the basis of the general relativistic framework in which our model for @xmath24 will be developed . in section 3 , we present the eht model for the vacuum ( or de ) energy density .",
    "then in section 4 , we examine the influence of the entropy s correction term in the vacuum energy density and its relevance in the renormalisation approach . in section 5",
    ", we deduce the equations of evolution for @xmath1 and @xmath25 , and present in section 6 , their numerical resolution , in particular , the graphic of @xmath2 .",
    "section 7 is devoted to a brief conclusive summary .",
    "let us briefly recall the minimal assumptions underlying our model .    in order to set our notations ,",
    "let us first write the einstein equations:@xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 a positive constant ( the gr bare cosmological constant ) . only for this choice of coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the bianchi identity @xmath29 is satisfied @xcite@xcite .    assuming a perfect fluid of energy density @xmath30 and pressure @xmath31 , the energy - momentum tensor is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 , and the index `` @xmath34 '' means `` total '' .    following @xcite and @xcite , the perfect fluid",
    "is supposed to admit two components : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the first one corresponds to vacuum , i.e. , it obeys the  pseudo - barotropic \" equation of state : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the second component obeys a barotropic equation of state given by @xmath39 . in section 6",
    ", we consider dust ( @xmath40 ) .    in accordance with the wmap observational results of the cmb s anisotropies @xcite ,",
    "the metrics is taken to be the spatially flat ( @xmath7 ) flrw metrics . with these assumptions , equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath41 with @xmath42 and@xmath43as @xmath44 with @xmath45 variable , @xmath12 varies . in the following ,",
    "we refer to @xmath11 as the  variable cosmological constant \" .",
    "it can be considered as an  effective \" cc . the corresponding dark energy ( de)-component has the energy density : @xmath46 .",
    "we do not make any further assumption on a separated energy conservation for each component . in the old standard cosmological model , this assumption",
    "is made only for each era of  domination \" of one component ( e.g.  era dominated by the radiation \" ,  era dominated by the matter \" , today  era dominated by the de \" , or in the very early universe ",
    "era dominated by the inflation ( or the inflaton ) \" ) .",
    "if such an assumption can seem reasonable for these domination eras ( and so appears more as an approximation ) , it is not the case for the transient periods , as for instance the very recent epoch of transition from dark matter ( dm ) to de domination .",
    "anyway , the complete energy conservation due to the bianchi identity is more general than the separated conservations , which necessitate some supplementary assumption .",
    "for example , in the @xmath0 and quintessence models , a separated conservation law for each component implies a  variable \" equation of state .",
    "by contrast , the present model assumes the equations of state in a thermodynamical sense , i.e. given once for all , with an interaction between the two components .",
    "this kind of approach with components interaction has already been considered ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "let us sketch the rough scenario of the universe evolution .",
    "initially , setting @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the universe undergoes a de sitter inflation , with @xmath49",
    ". then @xmath45 decreases or equivalently , @xmath50 decreases with the universe expansion . in the same time",
    ", @xmath51 is increasing .",
    "finally , @xmath45 tends to @xmath52 or equivalently @xmath12 tends to @xmath53 , which is again a de sitter evolution .",
    "today , we observe a very small value for @xmath54 with a very large vacuum energy density @xmath55 given by quantum field theory ( today @xmath45 is of the order of @xmath56 ) . for a reasonable ( planck ) largest cut - off",
    ", we obtain @xmath57 . assuming a variable cosmological  constant \" solution ( as considered here )",
    ", this scheme appears as an hardly intelligible fine - tuning .",
    "it is the so - called  old problem \" of the cosmological constant ( cc ) .",
    "besides , the recent domination of the vacuum energy by dust constitutes the  new puzzle \" of the cc ( or `` coincidence problem '' ) . at the beginning",
    ", @xmath58 represents the energy density of the radiation and the ultrarelativistic matter . for sake of simplicity",
    ", we shall only consider in the following ( section 6 ) the non relativistic matter ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "we propose a phenomenological model of this de or , equivalently , this variable cosmological  constant \" ( or this vacuum energy density ) able to produce the main properties of this scenario .",
    "more particularly , the two problems of the cc are solved in the framework of our model where @xmath11 runs from a large initial value @xmath59 ( a huge inflation in the very early universe ) to a weak final constant @xmath60 which yet starts again to dominate , leading to `` the coincidence problem '' . in the two cases ,",
    "the same de , with a density @xmath12 is used to explain the universe acceleration .",
    "this de is negligible or dominates , depending on the considered period , and its density decreases all along the universe expansion .",

    "the three thermodynamical equations of state ( [ eq4 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) have to remain valid in flrw spacetime because the thermodynamical equations of state of any actual component ( e.g. @xmath73 , or the stefan law @xmath74 , for the equilibrium radiation ) are always supposed to be independent of the chosen spacetime . besides , the definition ( [ eq8 ] ) of @xmath70 remains also valid in the ( spatially flat ) flrw spacetime .",
    "consequently , from ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , we find that this de component is associated to the flrw e.h . via the relation ( [ eq7 ] ) . using ( [ eq7 ] ) , ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) , we obtain the expression ( [ eq6 ] ) for @xmath75 and ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath11 in the flrw spacetime too .",

    "article14 and major and setter @xcite , when there is not conservation of the number of particles in an open sytem , the sign `` - '' before the @xmath96-term has to be replaced by a sign `` + '' .",

    "another interesting result to be noted is the shape of the curve @xmath252 ( fig.1 ) which presents a symmetry with respect to @xmath253 , suggesting a period for @xmath186 .",
    "each curve ( @xmath254 ) is ( quasi- ) symmetrical with respect to @xmath255 . the functions @xmath256 and @xmath1 decrease ( increase resp .",

    "there is a  big bounce \" on an inflationary space at @xmath255 , with a period that is stretched over more than twice @xmath259 and another one at a very large time on a quasi- de sitter space .",

    "one can also evaluate @xmath268 in the early period of deflation ( i.e. desinflation ) .",
    "for instance at @xmath269 when inflation was present , though decreasing , because @xmath270 , we obtain @xmath271.we can yet obtain @xmath272 for @xmath273 during some time after the end of the initial inflation .",

    "the event horizon thermodynamical model presented here allows us to account for most of essential features of the cosmology such as the value of the age of the universe,@xmath298 ( safe from the age problem @xcite ) , the ratio @xmath299}{\\lambda \\lbrack \\tau _ { 0}]}\\sim 5\\times 10^{112}$ ] , as well as the exit of inflation after about @xmath300 planck times , the existence of a minimum @xmath301 @xmath302 for @xmath21 attained after about @xmath130 @xmath303 , the coming back of the inflation ( after about @xmath304 from the beginning ) , followed by the recent coincidence , at @xmath305 , with the matter density , but also allows us to address the entropy problem , and the creation of ( dark ) matter from the vacuum energy .",
