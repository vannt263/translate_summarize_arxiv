    "<S> we introduce a modular ( integral ) complementary polynomial @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) of two variables of a graph @xmath2 by counting the number of modular ( integral ) complementary tension - flows ( ctf ) of @xmath2 with an orientation @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we study these polynomials by further introducing a cut - eulerian equivalence relation on orientations and geometric structures such as the complementary open lattice polyhedron @xmath4 , the complementary open 0 - 1 polytope @xmath5 , and the complementary open lattice polytopes @xmath6 with respect to orientations @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the polynomial @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) is a common generalization of the modular ( integral ) tension polynomial @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and the modular ( integral ) flow polynomial @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and can be decomposed into a sum of product ehrhart polynomials of complementary open 0 - 1 polytopes @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> there are dual complementary polynomials @xmath13 and @xmath14 , dual to @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively , in the sense that the lattice - point counting to the ehrhart polynomials is taken inside a topological sum of the dilated closed polytopes @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the polynomial @xmath13 is whitney s rank generating polynomial @xmath18 , which gives rise to a combinatorial interpretation on the values of the tutte polynomial @xmath19 at positive integers . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , some special values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath15 and @xmath22 ) count the number of certain special kinds ( of equivalence classes ) of orientations . </S>"
