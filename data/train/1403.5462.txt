    "the models make contact with very recent work on networked control systems where sensors and actuators are separated by a communication network of limited capacity .",
    "( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "much of the motivation for the work reported below comes from attempts to understand the ways in which animals navigate based on visual perception of environmental features .",
    "more specifically , our previous work in @xcite and @xcite discusses ways in which a flying animal s perceptions of optical flow can provide cues that enable goal - directed steering through fields of obstacles .",
    "several steering laws based on optical flows generated both by single features and pairs of features were proposed .",
    "the argued biological plausibility of the laws is supported by simulations that reconstruct actual animal flight paths by incorporating appropriate protocols for switching among the laws .    while the results were encouraging , it is clear that further research is needed in several directions to more completely understand bio - mimetic motion control algorithms .",
    "one limitation of the laws proposed in @xcite and @xcite is that they utilize only one or two features at a time .",
    "animals undoubtedly are sensitive and reacting to larger numbers of features as they fly .",
    "it was also the case that the features on which flight simulations were based were chosen somewhat mechanistically .",
    "biomimetic response to optical flow undoubtedly involves dynamic and continual refocusing of attention based on visual saliency ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our current research continues to be focused on ephemeral sensed data of the type that is generated by sparse optical flow ( @xcite ) . at the same time , the work described in what follows is aimed at developing a conceptual understanding of feedback control that is based on streams of data coming from random elements in a sensor array ( e.g.  photo - receptors in the eye ) with each sensor providing data over time intervals that may be quite short relative to the time - constants of the system being controlled . to ground this work in a familiar context ,",

    "hence , we are explicitly assuming that @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "unlike these earlier references , however , we shall consider the case that the input and output channels are available randomly .",

    "the probability of a randomly selected set of vectors of the form ( [ eq : jb : randomvectors ] ) spanning is high .",
    "there is of course a corresponding notion of _ random channel observability_. as in section 3 , we assume that @xmath45 in ( [ eq : jb : basic ] ) is invertible .    let @xmath4 be an observable pair with @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath83 @xmath84 as in ( [ eq : jb : basic ] )",

    "* remark : * as in the case of random channel controllability , not all observable pairs are random channel observable .",
    "the following is dual to proposition 3.2 .",
    "consider the system ( [ eq : jb : basic ] ) under the assumption that @xmath4 is an observable pair .",
    "let @xmath63 be a random sequence drawn sequentially with equal probability and replacement from the index set @xmath86 . if @xmath64 , the probability @xmath88 that the corresponding random vector sequence @xmath89 spans @xmath25 satisfies the following inequality @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the stirling number of the second kind denoting the number of ways to partition a set of @xmath12 objects into @xmath1 nonempty subsets , and where we have simplified notation by writing @xmath68 . if the system ( [ eq : jb : basic ] ) is random channel controllable , the right hand inequality holds with equality .",
    "if the system is not random channel controllable , the right hand inequality is strict .",
    "the proof is virtually the same as that of proposition 3.2 and hence is omitted .",
    "the discussion in section 3 is focused on conditions under which there exists a sequence of inputs that will steer a controllable system between prescribed initial and final states .",
    "it does not prescribe an algorithm for sequentially choosing the inputs that achieve any particular control objective . following the work in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we consider the problem of stabilizing an lti system with random input channel access of the type discussed above .",
    "because randomness is an essential feature of our problem , feedback stabilization can only be achieved in a probabilistic sense . for systems with unstable modes ,",
    "the controller s random access to input channels will make meaningful stabilization challenging , and feedback gains must be chosen to account for the probability that channels will be inaccessible for certain periods of time . for the probabilistic access models under consideration , occasional randomly occurring inaccessibility of an input channel will lead to large excursions of the system dynamics .",
    "it will be argued that such excursions will be statistically inevitable , and they will occur over time intervals with typical lengths that are similar to the time - to - failure intervals described in @xcite .    to fix ideas , consider example 3.1 .",
    "it follows from proposition 3.2 that when @xmath27 is large , it will require a relatively large number of input steps to produce a controlled motion in every dimension of the state space .",
    "indeed , when channels are selected sequentially and randomly with equal probability equal to @xmath92 , the mean waiting time for any channel to be selected is exactly @xmath27 .",
    "this follows from simply realizing that the selection of each channel is a bernoulli process with probability of selection @xmath93 .",
    "a further consequence of properties of mean waiting times in bernoulli processes is that the variance of channel selections is @xmath94 .",
    "this means that the mean trajectories of the scalar components @xmath95 will not adequately characterize the dynamics of the system since with high probability there will be large waiting times between successive channel availabilities .    to further understand the complexity of this example",
    ", we consider a simple scalar process governed by a bernoulli random switching .",
    "specifically suppose a real - valued process @xmath96 evolves according to    @xmath97    the mean of this process is deterministic and at the @xmath98th step has the value @xmath99 .",
    "the mean is thus asymptotically stable precisely when @xmath100 .",
    "the second moment of the process will be asymptotically stable when @xmath101 , however , and from this , it is easy to see that there are processes that are stable in the mean but which have unbounded variance .",
    "this may be problematic for systems depicted in example 3.1 with unstable open - loop modes . in these cases , @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "we can examine this more explicitly by considering the first and second moments of the process ( [ eq : jb : singlechannel ] ) .",
    "the mean process is the simple linear equation @xmath104 x(k)$ ] .",
    "restricting to non - oscillatory trajectories , the mean of the process will be asymptotically stable when @xmath105 , which requires that @xmath106 .",
    "for the case of example 3.1 , @xmath107 and the maximum size of an open - loop unstable mode , @xmath108 , can be written as a function of @xmath27 : @xmath109 .",
    "the second moment of the process ( [ eq : jb : singlechannel ] ) will similarly be stable when @xmath110 .",
    "simple algebra again shows that the maximum size of a mode @xmath108 leading to a stable second moment is @xmath111 .",
    "it is perhaps not surprising that both these bounds are similar to the stabilizability and error tolerance conditions associated with the data - rate theorem , @xcite .",
    "returning to the remark that bernoulli processes have fat tailed distributions , we note that even when a feedback law stabilizes the means of the eigenmodes of a system of the form given in example 3.1 , the variance may be unbounded .",
    "this is illustrated by the simulations plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zk : simulation ] .",
    "=3 dimensional state , all three open loop modes are @xmath112 , and the stabilizing feedbacks @xmath113 , rendering the closed loop modes equal to @xmath114 .",
    "the solid red curve is the mean of 1000 trajectories , the dotted red curves denote the empirical variance , and the black curves are 500 of the simulated trajectories  which clearly make major excursions from the mean . ]",
    "the paper has introduced problems of feedback control in which sensor and actuator connections to a plant are achieved through randomly accessed communication channels . the motivation for the discussion is biological navigation through feature networks ( e.g. visually perceived features ) . while this is most naturally related to random channel observability problems , limitations of space have led us to consider only random channel control problems .",
    "the paper has introduced what are believe to be new notions that we have called _ random channel controllability _ and _ random channel observability_. these are stronger than the usual notions of controllability and observability in lti systems .",
    "these concepts suggest that we may think of a set of input ( or output ) channels as being salient if any @xmath27-step combination involving all of them is enough to steer the system to an arbitrary goal point .",
    "the main results of the paper point to an increased likelihood of a random sequence of input channels providing controllability ( observability ) when the number of channels is not too large .",
    "specifically this is suggested by propositions 3.2 and 4.2 as well as the example treated in section 5 .",
    "it is partly a consequence of the need to use all available channels to realize controllability combined with the restriction that only a single channel can be used at a time .",
    "while we shall report some relaxation of the single channel restriction elsewhere , ( and consider problem 1 of the introduction ) , we believe it is also worth observing that the limits on stabilization for multi - channel systems may point to fundamental limits in the amount of information that can be processed to achieve desired control objectives .",
    "finally , we remark that future work will be aimed at developing probabilistic extensions of the output stabilizability results in @xcite and @xcite to the case of systems with random access input and output channels .",
