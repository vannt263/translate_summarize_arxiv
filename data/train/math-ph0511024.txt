    "we are interested in products of ratios of characteristic polynomials @xmath19 , averaged with respect to the probability measure @xmath20 .",
    "our goal is to derive exact expressions for such autocorrelation functions .",
    "quantities of a similar kind , for gaussian distributed hermitian matrices , were first computed some time ago in the large-@xmath21 limit by andreev and simons @xcite , using an elaboration of the supersymmetry method pioneered by wegner and efetov .",
    "then , in 1996 - 97 , one of us developed a variant @xcite of the wegner - efetov method to handle the case of haar - ensemble averages for the compact lie groups above .",
    "with guidance from a perceptive remark of sarnak @xcite , it soon transpired that the mathematical foundation of that variant had existed in classical invariant theory for decades , and is known there as _",

    "@xmath22  were presented at the msri workshop on `` random matrices and their applications '' ( berkeley , june 1999 ) .",
    "the second step of that original approach was to express the primitive @xmath22-character as a co - adjoint orbit integral ( actually , a berezin superintegral )  la kirillov , and finally to compute this integral by a super version of the localization principle for equivariantly closed differential forms @xcite . while this last step works in the so - called _ stable range _",
    ", i.e. , for large enough @xmath21 , the superintegral becomes too subtle an object to handle for small values of @xmath21 and , in any case , this type of analysis has not yet been perfected to the stage of yielding mathematical theorems . in the present paper , we replace it by a combination of algebraic and analytical techniques _ avoiding _ superintegration .",
    "while this research was initially motivated by quantum chaos and the physics of disordered systems , the main motivation for bringing it to completion comes from analytic number theory . in that area ,",
    "random matrices have been a recurrent and growing theme ever since montgomery conjectured the pair correlation function of the non - trivial zeroes of the riemann zeta function to be asymptotic to dyson s pair correlation function for the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) and since odlyzko s high - precision numerical study demonstrated asymptotic agreement of the distribution of spacings between the riemann zeroes with the spacing distribution predicted from gue .",
    "the conjectured relation between the zeroes of zeta functions and eigenvalues of random matrices was much clarified by the work of katz and sarnak @xcite , which shifted the emphasis from riemann zeta to _ families _ of @xmath23-functions . carried out in the setting of @xmath23-functions over finite fields , this work explained how a limit procedure for families leads to equidistribution on one of the classical compact lie groups @xmath24",
    ", @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath16 , or @xmath27 , the group being determined by the symmetry of the family .",
    "keating and snaith made the proposal that the connection between @xmath23-functions and random matrices should carry over to the case of global @xmath23-functions .",
    "in particular , they conjectured @xcite that the critical value distribution of the riemann zeta function ( or , more precisely , a certain universal part thereof , which is hard to access by number theory methods ) can be modelled by the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix @xmath28",
    ". a sizable number of precise generalizations of this proposal have since been made , although most of the theory to date remains at the conjectural level .    in a companion paper @xcite we present various conjectures that are suggested for @xmath23-functions by the keating - snaith conjecture and the results of our work .",
    "the present paper is solely concerned with the random - matrix aspect of this unfolding story ; the reader is referred to our second paper for the related details concerning @xmath23-functions .",
    "we now define the quantity to be studied in this paper . postponing the cases of the compact lie groups @xmath29 and @xmath30 to another publication we focus on the case of @xmath31 and , fixing a pair of positive integers @xmath5 and @xmath32 , consider for @xmath33 the product of ratios of characteristic polynomials @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the complex conjugate of the unitary matrix @xmath36 .",

    "the answer is that at some point we will take advantage of a certain riemannian structure , by restricting the complex parameters @xmath49 and @xmath38 to @xmath50 .    if @xmath51 denotes the @xmath52-haar measure normalized by @xmath53 , our goal is to establish an exact expression for the ensemble average @xmath54 for all matrix dimensions @xmath55 .",

    "it is easy to see that the terms in the sum for @xmath7 do not change under the substitution @xmath66 if @xmath67 .",

    "the present paper develops the point of view that ( [ eq thm0 ] ) is best seen as a result in the theory of lie superalgebras and supergroups : it is the latter framework that delivers the answer for _ all _ values of @xmath76 .      the method we will use to prove thm .",
    "[ thm0 ] rests on the fact that @xmath52 is in howe duality with a lie superalgebra @xmath77 for @xmath9 .",
    "the details are briefly speaking as follows .",

    "[ sect:2 ] , the supertrace of the operator representing the pair @xmath91 on @xmath82 equals the product of ratios ( [ r for u(n ) ] ) . moreover , the joint action of the howe dual pair @xmath92 on @xmath82 is _ multiplicity - free _ , which leads to the following key observation .",
    "[ prop 1.2 ] the function @xmath93 is a primitive @xmath77-character , and is given by the @xmath77-representation on the space of @xmath52-invariants in @xmath87 .    from prop .",

    "some answer for @xmath7 ( in the form of a littlewood - richardson sum over products of @xmath95- and @xmath96-characters , using the @xmath97 branching rules ) has recently been given in @xcite ; that answer , however , is not of the explicit form we are looking for .    in this paper @xmath98 will be computed explicitly by drawing on some of berezin s results for the radial parts of the laplace - casimir operators for the classical _ lie supergroup _",
    "the outcome is the formula stated in thm .",
    "let us now rewrite that formula using the standard language of representation theory .",
    "it is appropriate to regard the @xmath100 parameters @xmath101 as linear functions on a cartan subalgebra @xmath102 of diagonal transformations in the lie superalgebra @xmath103 ; by linearly combining them one can then form the roots of @xmath22 and the weights of its representations .",

    "these are the sets @xmath114    the primitive characters of a compact lie group @xmath4 are expressed by the weyl character formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which says that if @xmath115 is an irreducible representation with regular highest weight @xmath116 , then @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the weyl group of @xmath4 , and @xmath119 denotes the system of @xmath116-positive roots .    our answer for @xmath7 will look like a natural generalization of this formula to the case of lie supergroups .",
    "the weyl group @xmath118 of our problem is the same as the symmetric group @xmath120 of permutations of the @xmath121 basis vectors of the first summand in @xmath122 ( which are dual to the coordinate functions @xmath123 ) . while the weyl group @xmath118 is defined by its action on the cartan subalgebra @xmath124 , what is needed here is the induced action on linear functions @xmath125 by @xmath126 .    because the highest weight @xmath112 of the @xmath106-representation at hand turns out to be non - regular , it is not @xmath118 that matters but its quotient by the subgroup @xmath127 that fixes @xmath128",

    "the mathematical situation in this limit is ruled by a howe dual pair @xcite of compact lie groups @xmath146 which is to say that @xmath147 acts without multiplicity on an exterior algebra @xmath148 , and the left - hand side of ( [ eq 1.9 ] ) is the character of the irreducible representation of @xmath149 on the subalgebra of @xmath4-invariants in @xmath148 .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ eq 1.9 ] ) is nothing but the classical weyl character formula evaluated for the irreducible @xmath150-representation with ( non - regular ) highest weight @xmath151      when all of the @xmath152-parameters are removed , thm .",

    "the pair @xmath156 acts without multiplicity on a symmetric algebra @xmath157 ( generated by a direct sum of @xmath5 copies of @xmath158 and @xmath6 copies of the dual vector space of @xmath158 ) by the _ shale - weil _ or _ oscillator representation_.    taking a product of @xmath159 reciprocals of characteristic polynomials and their conjugates and averaging with haar measure of @xmath160 , one again gets a primitive character : @xmath161 which is the character @xmath162 of the representation of @xmath163 on the subalgebra of @xmath4-invariants in @xmath157 . for all positive integers @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath21 , these @xmath163-representations are irreducible , unitary , and with highest weight @xmath164      in the range @xmath165 , the representations with highest weight ( [ hw dprime ] ) belong to the _ principal discrete series _ of @xmath166 , which is to say that they can be realized by hilbert spaces of @xmath167-functions on @xmath163 and are covered by an analog of the borel - weil correspondence known for the compact case .",
    "the characters in that range turn out to have a particularly simple expression : @xmath168 this formula actually continues to hold as long as @xmath169 . as a matter of fact , in that range",
    "the algebra of @xmath4-invariants in the oscillator module @xmath157 is _ freely generated _ by the quadratic invariants that correspond to the system of @xmath170-positive roots .",
    "the range @xmath171 where ( [ stable u(n ) ] ) holds is called the _ stable _ range . from the vantage point of ( [ eq thm0 ] ) the simplicity of the result ( [ stable u(n ) ] )",
    "comes about because throughout the stable range , only the term from the identity coset @xmath172 $ ] in the sum over @xmath69 \\in \\mathrm{s}_{p+q } / ( \\mathrm{s}_p \\times \\mathrm{s}_q)$ ] survives the limit of removing the parameters @xmath173 .    on the other hand , the said characters _",

    "their representations have no realization by @xmath167-functions on @xmath163 and are called _",
    "singular_. the algebra of @xmath4-invariants outside the stable range is _ not _ freely generated ; there exist relations and the characters therefore do not have any expression as simple as ( [ stable u(n ) ] ) .",
    "in fact , when these characters are extracted from our supersymmetric master formula ( [ eq thm0 ] ) , there is a build up of combinatorial complexity because the product over odd - root factors @xmath174 starts competing with the highest weight factor @xmath175 so that an increasing number of terms survives the process of removing the @xmath152-parameters .      given the existence of a stable and a `` non - stable '' range for the non - compact sector , one should expect the same distinction to be visible also in the full , supersymmetric situation .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "our answer ( [ eq thm0 ] ) has recently been reproduced partially by two independent approaches : by the work of conrey , forrester and snaith @xcite which is based on the results for orthogonal polynomials by fyodorov and strahov @xcite and baik , deift and strahov @xcite , and in a preprint by bump and gamburd @xcite using symmetric function theory .",
    "both make a statement only in the stable range for @xmath55 .",
    "a fourth viable approach in that range is our original 1999 method of computation ( i.e. , expressing the character in question as a co - adjoint orbit superintegral and then calculating it by an equivariant localization technique ) which is how the formulas ( [ eq thm1 ] ) and ( [ eq thm0 ] ) were first obtained .    from our experience , proving thm .",
    "[ thm0 ] _ outside _ the stable range for @xmath21 is qualitatively more difficult ! in fact , in view of the singular nature of the representations in the underlying non - compact situation , we consider it somewhat of a miracle that a formula as universal and simple as ( [ eq thm0 ] ) happens to be true for all @xmath60 .",
