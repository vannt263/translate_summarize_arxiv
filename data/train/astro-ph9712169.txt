    "the denis consortium has been imaging the southern sky in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 wavebands since december 1995 . when the survey is complete , around 20002001 , we expect to have extracted tens of thousands of galaxies in @xmath3 , roughly one million in @xmath4 , and a few million in @xmath5 ( see   [ discus ] below for our estimated sizes of homogeneous , highly complete , reliable and photometrically accurate galaxy catalogs ) .",
    "much of the information in this review has been given elsewhere ( mamon et al . 1997b ) .",
    "the notable improvements here are improved reliability estimates from a much larger visually classified sample , a first - order optimization of star / galaxy separation yielding a one - half magnitude improvement in the high completeness / reliability magnitude limit and a more accurate estimate of the photometric accuracy .",
    "wide - angle near infrared ( hereafter nir ) galaxy surveys , such as denis and 2mass ( see schneider , jarrett , rosenberg and cutri , all in these proceedings ) will have a wide array of scientific prospects , of which a few are listed below .",
    "the two important advantages of nir selection are 1 ) the near transparency of interstellar dust in our foreground galaxy and within external galaxies , and 2 ) the low sensitivity of nir light to recent star formation in galaxies ( see mamon et al .",
    "1997b ) , hence a better estimation of the stellar mass content of galaxies in the nir .",
    "[ [ statistics - of - nir - properties - of - galaxies ] ] statistics of nir properties of galaxies : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    denis and 2mass will provide the first very large galaxy databases with nir photometry .",
    "photometry of the brighter galaxies will be coupled with redshift measurements , either already made , or performed during spectroscopic followups ( see , e.g. , mamon 1996 ; paturel , in these proceedings ) to be used for distance estimates and computation of precise parameters of the fundamental plane and tully - fisher relations ( see vauglin et al .",
    "1997 ; rosenberg , in these proceedings ) .",
    "[ [ cross - identification - with - other - wavelengths ] ] cross - identification with other wavelengths : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the extragalactic objects extracted by denis and 2mass will be cross - identified with analogous samples at other wavelengths , such as optical galaxy samples , for example in the zone of avoidance ( see kraan - korteweg et al .",
    ", in these proceedings ) , iras galaxies ( saunders et al .",
    "1997 ) , quasars ( see cutri , in these proceedings ) , radio - galaxies , galaxies found in blind hi surveys ( see kraan - korteweg et al .",
    ", in these proceedings ) , etc",
    ". the nir properties ( mainly their location in color - color diagrams ) of such objects will be targeted for discovering new large samples of such objects .",
    "one should expect followups at non - nir wavelengths of denis and 2mass galaxies .",
    "[ [ galaxy - counts ] ] galaxy counts : + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there has been a debate on the level of galaxy counts at the bright end , as first estimates ( heydon - dumbleton et al . 1989 ; maddox et al . 1990 ) found a depletion relative to the extrapolation of the faint - end counts , while later work ( e.g. bertin & dennefeld 1997 ) disputed this .",
    "this debate has consequences on galaxy evolution and on whether the environment of the local group is underdense on very large scales ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "[ [ zone - of - avoidance ] ] zone of avoidance + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    there are two main applications for studying galaxies behind the galactic plane ( see kraan - korteweg et al . , in these proceedings ) : 1 ) mapping the large - scale distribution of galaxies in this still poorly known region . indeed , the zone of avoidance contains interesting structures such as the largest large - scale concentration of matter in the local universe , the great attractor ( at the intersection of the supergalactic plane and the galactic plane , kolatt , dekel & lahav 1995 ) and within the great attractor , the norma cluster , abell 3627 , richer and closer than the coma cluster ( kraan - korteweg et al . 1995 ) .",
    "2 ) the fluxes and angular sizes of galaxies are affected by extinction from dust in the galactic plane , and one can measure this extinction from galaxy counts ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) , colors ( mamon et al .",
    "1997a ) , and color - color diagrams ( schrder et al .",
    "1997 , and kraan - korteweg et al .",
    ", in these proceedings ) .",
    "[ [ small - scale - structures - of - galaxies ] ] small - scale structures of galaxies + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    only a few catalogs of clusters ( lumsden et al . 1992 ; dalton et al .",
    "1997 ; escalera & macgillivray 1995 , 1996 ) and compact groups ( prandoni , iovino & macgillivray 1994 ) are based upon automatically selected galaxy samples , which happen to be optical and photographic ( hence subject to photometric non - linearities ) . because star formation is probably enhanced by galaxy interactions ,",
    "one expects that the statistical properties of pairs , groups and clusters of galaxies built from nir selected galaxy catalogs will be different from those built from optical catalogs .",
    "denis and 2mass will thus have the double advantage of using a nir galaxy sampled based upon linear ( non - photographic ) photometry .",
    "the applications of such nir - based samples of structures of galaxies are numerous ( e.g. mamon 1994 ) and include understanding the dynamics of these structures , their bias to projection effects , their constraints on @xmath19 and the primordial density fluctuation spectrum , their use as distance indicators , and the environmental influences on galaxies .    [",
    "[ large - scale - structure - of - the - universe ] ] large - scale structure of the universe : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the nir selection and the linear photometry will also benefit the measurement of statistics ( two - point and higher - order angular correlation functions , counts in cells , topological genus , etc . )",
    "of the large - scale distribution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "for example , the ( 3d ) primordial density fluctuation spectrum of galaxy clustering can be obtained from the two - point angular correlation function ( baugh & efstathiou 1993 ) or from the 2d power spectrum ( baugh & efstathiou 1994 ) . moreover , by the end of denis and 2mass , large - scale cosmological simulations with gas dynamics incorporated ( thanks to which galaxies are properly identified ) will provide adequate galaxy statistics in projection that will be compared with those obtained from the surveys , iterating over the cosmological input parameters of the simulations .",
    "the current galaxy pipeline consists of the following steps :    \\1 ) bias subtraction , flat - fielding , bad pixel mapping and astrometric calibration ( standard denis paris data analysis center pipeline , borsenberger 1997 ) ; 2 ) cosmic ray removal ; 3 ) extraction of photometric zero - points and airmasses from relevant files ; 4 ) galaxy extraction using the _ sextractor _ ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) object extraction software , version 1.2b6a ( which includes a neural - network star / galaxy separator , bertin 1996 , whose input parameters are 8 isophotal areas , the maximum intensity and as a control parameter , the fwhm of the psf ) , with detection and kron ( 1980 ) photometry parameters optimized from simulated images .",
    "nevertheless , star / galaxy separation is intrinsically difficult because , at the galaxy extraction limits @xmath20 ( see below ) , denis will extract roughly 5.5 times as many stars as galaxies in @xmath5 , at very high galactic latitude ( @xmath21 , see lidman & peterson 1996 ) , and the ratio worsens considerably at lower galactic latitudes and at brighter magnitudes .",
    "we discuss below the steps towards an efficient star / galaxy separation method . for this",
    ", we extracted in the @xmath5 band ( which has the best angular resolution ) classical star / galaxy separation diagnostics such as isophotal area , peak intensity , and fwhm , as well as the neural - network based stellarity parameter , in a direct fashion , or using a suitably modified version of sextractor that includes a two - dimensional modeling of the psf that is used as input to the neural network .",
    "one of us ( g.a.m . ) has classified by eye a set of 329 galaxy candidates on 109 denis @xmath5 band images ( of which 33 appeared on consecutive images , leaving 296 unique candidates ) . these candidates were chosen with @xmath22 , centers at least 20 pixels from the image borders .",
    "furthermore , they met _ at least one _ of the following loose ( to ensure completeness ) galaxy criteria ( _ dashed lines _ in fig .",
    "[ diag6 ] ) :            we ve optimized each of the 6 algorithms plotted in figure [ diag6 ] for a linear star / galaxy separator in these plots ( slope and normalization , except that we forced a zero slope for the two neural network algorithms ) .",
    "the results are showed in figure [ automatic ] , which plots the completeness - reliability plots for 4 of the 5 truth tables .",
    "the different points in figure [ automatic ] for a given algorithm correspond to different cuts through the algorithm versus magnitude diagram and we only plotted the optimal slope , varying the normalization .",
    "figure [ automatic ] shows that the pseudo - surface brightness criterion is slightly superior to the peak intensity , which , in turn , is slightly superior to the isophotal area ( except for the cosmos - based truth table , for which isophotal area does best ) .",
    "the other three algorithms ( fwhm , and neural network stellarity before and after psf modeling ) , are far inferior to the first three algorithms . for the visually classified denis @xmath5 sample ,",
    "we achieve 92.5% reliability at 98% completeness , and for the global sample we obtain 96% reliability at 96% completeness .",
    "the poor results of the neural networks is probably due to the variations of the psf across the frames , and for this particular denis strip ( number 5570 ) , psf modeling worsened the results !",
    "the limiting factors turn out to be star / galaxy separation in @xmath5 , photometry and star / galaxy separation in @xmath4 , and detection in @xmath3 ( assuming that @xmath5-band star / galaxy separation is used to classify objects detected in the other bands ) .    using the counts from figure",
    "[ counts ] to extrapolate to the entire survey area ( roughly a hemisphere ) , we infer that our homogeneous catalogs will have sizes of @xmath29 at @xmath30 ( 0.2 mag photometry ) , @xmath31 to @xmath32 at @xmath33 and 14.8 ( with 0.2 and 0.1 mag photometry , respectively ) , and @xmath34 galaxies at @xmath2 ( 0.1 mag photometry ) .",
    "the recent installation of an air conditioning system on the @xmath3 band optics has decreased the instrumental background by 0.7 magnitude , which should bring the extraction limit to @xmath35 , and thus increase the size of the homogeneous @xmath3 sample to roughly @xmath36 galaxies .",
    "moreover , there is still room for progress on star / galaxy separation .",
    "c. alard has devised a new algorithm to accurately model the variations of the psf across the frame , which need no longer be an elliptical gaussian ( fitting the asymmetric coma of the images ) , and tests on visually classified data are about to be performed .",
