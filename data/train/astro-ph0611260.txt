    "the synchrotron radiation is a very common emission mechanism among various astrophysical sources : supernova remnants , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) , etc .",
    "it allows to explain a wide range of different broad - band spectra by adjusting distribution functions of radiating particles .",
    "the models employing synchrotron radiation are more constrained in the so - called fast cooling regime , where the bulk of particles radiate away their energy before escaping the emitting region or loosing energy through adiabatic cooling .",
    "the fast cooling regime is desirable for very luminous objects like agns and grbs since the energy limitations of their central engines imply rather high radiative efficiency . also , this regime is what one expects in these objects theoretically , based on the standard assumption that the magnetic field strength is close to the equipartition value , which is enough to ensure fast cooling even through synchrotron radiation alone .    in this paper",
    "we put emphasis on agns and grbs , investigating general characteristics of their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , such as location of the peak and the spectral indices below and above the peak .",
    "we analyze whether the observed spectra can be made consistent with the standard particle acceleration models or in principle explained by the synchrotron radiation ( including into consideration models with non - uniform magnetic field distribution ) .",
    "in the generally accepted model , the observed emission of agns and grbs comes from a succession of multiple mildly relativistic shocks , which form within continuous outflow of magnetized plasma with the bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 .",
    "these internal shocks accelerate electrons , which are eventually advected downstream of the shock front , where they produce synchrotron radiation .    the schematic distribution of electrons injected at the shock front , @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the lorentz factor of an electron ) , is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "most of the electrons belong to `` thermal '' population with average energy of the order of the average energy of shocked protons @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the shock lorentz factor ) . at a certain ( low ) level",
    "there is a smooth transition from the `` thermal '' distribution to a power - law non - thermal one formed by shock - accelerated electrons .",
    "the power - law cuts off at an energy where the radiative losses start to prevail over the acceleration energy gain .",
    "is the shock lorentz factor , @xmath5  electron s gyrofrequency , and @xmath6  the fine structure constant . ]    in the fast cooling regime , the electrons distribution function changes as the electrons are advected away from the shock front and cool : the cut - off shifts towards progressively smaller energies .",
    "however , the observed luminosity is the integral of emissivity along the line of sight , so that in the one - zone model with constant magnetic - field strength downstream one only needs to know the integral of the distribution function along the shock normal , @xmath7 , to calculate the observed spectrum ( due to the effect of relativistic beaming , only those portions of the shock whose normal is closely aligned with the line of sight contribute to the observed emission ) . in effect , the problem is reduced to the case of uniform injection .",
    "the electron distribution function can be found from the continuity equation in the energy - momentum space @xmath8 which gives stationary solution @xmath9 the corresponding sed ( assuming the radiation is monochromatic with frequency @xmath10 ) is : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the fraction of electron s energy transferred to the synchrotron radiation .    apparently , there are two prominent features in the distribution function given by eq .",
    "[ cool - distr ] , and the peak in an observed sed can be related to either of them .",
    "one , more or less standard assignment ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , links the peak to the break at the transitional region between `` thermal '' and non - thermal electrons .",
    "alternatively , one may link the peak to the cut - off region of the electron distribution ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .",
    "the alternative assignment of the sed peak has more explanatory power as far as spectral index above the peak is considered .",
    "the predicted cut - off shape for a particle distribution originating from acceleration at a relativistic shock is model - dependent and very different from a simple exponential cut - off @xcite , in accordance with the observed spectral indices , which are indeed different for different sources . on the contrary ,",
    "the standard assignment of the sed peak has difficulty in explaining this difference since diffusive shock acceleration gives a universal power - law @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "] , resulting in very hard ( @xmath14 ) and _ universal _ spectra above the peak .",
    "in the internal shock model , the comoving - frame lorentz factor of thermal electrons is @xmath15 , so that the standard assignment of sed peak implies that it is observed at the energy @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the magnetic field strength in the comoving frame .",
    "the internal shocks form at a distance @xmath18 from the central engine , where @xmath19 is the source s variability timescale , which is related to the size of central engine .",
    "assuming equipartition between the magnetic - field and the radiation - field energy densities , we find that the magnetic field strength is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the apparent luminosity of a source . substituting eq .",
    "[ b ] into eq .",
    "[ thermal - peak ] , we get the location of sed peak : @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the luminosity in units @xmath24 erg / s , @xmath25 the variability timescale in units @xmath26 s , and @xmath27 the bulk lorentz factor in units @xmath28 . these units are chosen because they are standard parameters of a typical gamma - ray burst .",
    "equation [ sedpeak1 ] predicts that grbs have their spectral energy distributions peaked at roughly 1  mev , in accordance with observations .",
    "however , a typical agn with luminosity @xmath29 erg / s , variability timescale @xmath30  s , and the bulk lorentz factor @xmath31 should have an sed peaked at around 1  ev  hardly enough to explain ir - peaked agns , and far too low for mev - peaked blazars .    assigning the sed peak to the cut - off region of the electron injection function poses difficulties as well .",
    "indeed , in the case of bohm diffusion the acceleration rate at a relativistic shock is @xmath32 and hence the maximum acceleration energy for electrons , determined from the balance between energy gain and radiative losses , @xmath33 equals to @xmath34^{1/2 } m_e c^2}{\\sqrt{e^3 b}}\\ , , \\ ] ] and the associated sed peak of their synchrotron emission is at @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fine structure constant . the location of sed peak given by eq .",
    "[ sedpeak2 ] does not explicitly depend on the magnetic field strength ( although depends on it implicitly through @xmath37 and then @xmath38 ) and even for moderate values of the bulk lorentz factor appears to be in the gev range , unless the synchrotron efficiency @xmath39 is unreasonably low .    however , a diffusion faster than the bohm one results in a smaller peak energy , in better agreement with observations .",
    "for example , if the plasma in the bulk outflow can sustain magnetic - field inhomogeneities with sizes @xmath40 , then the electron scattering length can be made no larger than @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the electron s gyroradius .",
    "the value of the scattering length given by the above equation minimizes acceleration rate , which becomes equal to @xmath43 radiative losses terminate acceleration at @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the classical electron radius .",
    "consequently , the peak of synchrotron sed is at @xmath46 where @xmath47  g is the schwinger magnetic field and @xmath48 the `` cold '' gyroradius .    pushing theory to the limits given by eqs .",
    "[ diff - lim ] and [ min - accel ] requires that electron s motion is random small - angle scattering , that implies the magnetic field is effectively uncorrelated on scales larger than @xmath49 or ",
    "more precisely  that the power spectrum of the magnetic field @xmath50 peaks at @xmath51 and decreases towards smaller wavenumbers faster than @xmath52 . under such circumstances ,",
    "the electrons emit mostly due to their interaction with small - scale magnetic field inhomogeneities . if @xmath53 , then electrons radiate in the undulator regime @xcite and the typical frequency of their emission increases with decreasing magnetic - field scale .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath54 in eq .",
    "[ sedpeak3 ] can be made as small as unity , and prevalence of inverse - compton radiative losses ( @xmath55 ) further decreases @xmath56 . in the case of grbs , where @xmath57  g , we find from eq .",
    "( [ sedpeak3 ] ) that the peak of synchrotron sed can be located at just few mev , roughly in agreement with observations . for agns , whose typical value of the magnetic field strength is @xmath58  g , it is not possible to push the location of sed peak significantly below 1 kev while keeping the synchrotron efficiency at an acceptable level .",
    "this agrees with observations for many blazars , but can not explain ir - peaked agns .",
    "one of the problems in the interpretation of grb emission as the synchrotron radiation is that the low - frequency spectral index in the fast - cooling regime is too soft .",
    "the hardest possible injection @xmath59 gives ( see eq .",
    "[ cool - sed ] ) @xmath60 below the sed peak ( whose position in this case corresponds to @xmath61 ) , that is @xmath62 if the synchrotron efficiency @xmath39 is constant .",
    "however , in the synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) model the synchrotron efficiency is , generally speaking , a rising function of the electron lorentz factor . due to the klein - nishina effect , only photons whose frequency is less than @xmath63 can significantly contribute to the effective energy density of seed radiation : @xmath64 therefore , relative weight of synchrotron energy losses , @xmath65 , compared to the inverse - compton energy losses , @xmath66 , increases for electrons with larger lorentz factors . in a consistent ssc model with prevalence of inverse compton radiative losses in the klein - nishina regime",
    ", the synchrotron efficiency can rise as fast as @xmath67 , leading to a rather hard low - frequency spectrum of synchrotron radiation @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this can be a remedy for the synchrotron model of grb emission for the majority of bursts , although at a price of decreased synchrotron efficiency .    in the internal shock model of grbs applicability of this recipe",
    "is limited by the fact , that the comptonization proceeds not very deep in the klein - nishina regime . moreover , in some bursts the bulk of radiating electrons comptonize their own synchrotron radiation in the thomson regime . in this paper",
    "we propose another way to obtain hard low - frequency spectra , which is also suitable for ssc models in the thomson regime . to reach this goal",
    "we note , that the magnetic field behind the front of a relativistic shock is produced by various plasma instabilities rather than by simple mhd compression . this field is not frozen - in and must decay as the shocked plasma moves away from the shock front .",
    "it means that the different parts of the electron distribution function , which was treated as a single integrated distribution earlier in this paper , in fact `` feel '' different magnetic field strength ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , whereas the spectrum and energy density of seed photons do not significantly change inside a thin slab occupied by radiating electrons .",
    "( thin line ) , the magnetic field strength @xmath17 ( thick line ) , and the effective energy density of seed photons @xmath69 ( dotted line ) , as functions of distance from the shock front . ]    to investigate the main features of the proposed model , we start with delta - functional injection @xmath70 at the shock front . while cooling , the electrons are advected downstream with constant velocity @xmath71 , so that the spacial derivative of their lorentz factor is related to the time derivative : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the distance from the shock front and @xmath74 the thomson cross - section .",
    "let us assume that the spectrum of seed radiation is a power - law @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , so that @xmath77 .",
    "then , the solution to the continuity equation ( eq . [ cool - distr ] ) gives @xmath78    in the case of low synchrotron efficiency @xmath55 we obtain @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the radiation length of an electron with the lorentz factor @xmath61 .",
    "assuming that the magnetic field strength is a power - law function of the distance from the shock front , @xmath81 , we find the synchrotron efficiency @xmath82 and the dependence of typical synchrotron frequency on the lorentz factor of radiating electrons @xmath83    substituting eqs .",
    "[ eta ] and [ nu ] into the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ cool - sed ] , we find the emerging spectrum : @xmath84    there are two cases , which deserve particular attention .",
    "first of all , choosing @xmath85 in eq .",
    "[ non - uniform - sed ] models comptonization in the thomson regime : the effective energy density of seed photons very weakly ( logarithmically ) depends on the electron lorentz factor and this dependence can be ignored when calculating power - law indices . in this case",
    "we get @xmath86 in principle , this model allows for spectra as hard as @xmath87 , which is even harder than the low - frequency asymptotic in the synchrotron spectrum of an individual electron .",
    "however , the low - frequency spectrum remains softer than @xmath68 , unless @xmath88 .",
    "the self - consistent ssc model with comptonization in the klein - nishina regime and @xmath89 eventually brings no difference from its one - zone counterpart with constant magnetic field strength : @xmath90    the above model is easy to generalize for the case of purely synchrotron radiation ( @xmath91 ) in non - uniform magnetic field .",
    "the resulting spectrum is @xmath92 which gives the familiar @xmath62 outcome for the constant magnetic field strength , and even softer spectra for any decaying magnetic field .",
    "however , this case may be interesting if for some reason the magnetic field strength increases behind the shock front , so that @xmath93 is negative ,  such a situation results in relatively hard low - frequency spectra .",
    "we show that the low - energy ( below the sed peak ) part of agn and grb spectra can be adequately described by synchrotron emission models , which allow for a broad range of spectral indices .",
    "the low - energy synchrotron spectra can be as hard as @xmath94 for the synchrotron - self - compton model with comptonization in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "even harder spectra are possible in the case , where the magnetic field decays behind the shock front , and this result holds true even if comptonization proceeds in the thomson regime",
    ". however , this flexibility of theory always comes at a price of low synchrotron efficiency .",
    "comparison of observed high - energy spectra above the sed peak to the predictions of diffusive shock acceleration theory favors assignment of the peak to the cut - off in the injected electron distribution , whereas the standard assignment of the sed peak to the thermal break produces too hard and invariable high - energy spectral index .",
    "both assignments are consistent with the sed peak location observed in grbs , although the agreement is only marginal and may be merely a chance coincidence .",
    "furthermore , none of them can explain the position of sed peaks in all of the observed agns or even in the majority of them .",
    "we consider this result as a strong indication that a particle injection mechanism , other than the standard diffusive shock acceleration , is at work in relativistic shocks .",
