    "one of the central problems in astronomy is that of galaxy formation and evolution : when were the visible parts of galaxies assembled and when were the stars formed ?",
    "the merging of galaxies leads to changes in their masses , and stellar evolution changes their luminosities .",
    "the evolution of the mass - to - light ( @xmath3 ) ratio relates the mass and luminosity evolution .",
    "galaxy mass measurements are notoriously difficult .",
    "fortunately , empirical relations such as the tully - fisher relation for spiral galaxies ( tully & fisher 1977 ) and the fundamental plane ( fp ) for early - type galaxies ( dressler et al .  1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) can provide us with information on the masses and mass evolution of galaxies .",
    "the fp is a tight relation between the structural parameters and velocity dispersion , which under the assumption of homology implies that @xmath14 with low scatter ( faber et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "due to stellar evolution the @xmath3 ratio of a stellar population changes with redshift , and hence also the fp will change .",
    "the redshift evolution of the intercept of the fp is proportional to the evolution of the mean @xmath3 ratio .",
    "hence , the tightness of the fp relation makes it a very sensitive indicator of the mean age of the stellar population of early - type galaxies ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ) .    for cluster galaxies",
    ", the @xmath3 ratio evolves very slowly , indicating that the stars were formed at redshifts @xmath15 ( e.g. kelson et al .",
    "1997 ; bender et al .",
    "1998 ; van dokkum et al .  1998 ) .",
    "current semi - analytical hierarchical models place the assembly time of typical early - type galaxies at much lower redshifts ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1998 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , in hierarchical galaxy formation models the assembly time and star formation epoch are strongly dependent on the environment , with cluster early - type galaxies forming much earlier than those in the general field ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 ) . hence cluster",
    "early - type galaxies do not provide the most stringent tests of these models .",
    "moreover , the measured evolution of early - type galaxies may underestimate the true evolution because of the effects of morphological evolution .",
    "if many early - type galaxies evolved from late - type galaxies at @xmath16 , the sample of early - type galaxies at high redshift is only a subset of all progenitors of present - day early - type galaxies .",
    "this would lead us to underestimate the luminosity evolution , and hence overestimate the stellar formation redshift ( see van dokkum & franx 2001 , hereafter vdf01 ) .",
    "recent studies have started to explore the fp and @xmath3 ratios of high redshift early - type galaxies in the general field .",
    "interestingly , the fp of field early - type galaxies appears to be quite similar to that of cluster early - type galaxies out to @xmath17 ( treu et al .",
    "2001 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2001 ) , in apparent conflict with current semi - analytical models ( see van dokkum et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , there are indications for a significant offset between the two populations at higher redshift ( treu et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "( 2000 , hereafter k00 ) analysed the fp and color evolution of strong gravitational lens galaxies up to @xmath18 .",
    "the lensing cross section is dominated by galaxies with high central velocity dispersions , and the lens galaxies effectively provide a mass - selected sample of field early - type galaxies which can be compared to optically selected samples of field and cluster galaxies . the mass - selection is important because it limits malmquist - type biases , and it is much less sensitive to selection effects caused by morphological evolution .",
    "k00 find that the stars constituting the lens galaxies must have formed at @xmath19 for a flat cosmology with @xmath7 and @xmath20 , and conclude from their analysis that there are no significant differences between field and cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "k00 analyse the evolution of the fp in the observed photometric bands , and their modeling necessarily includes the large variation in observed magnitudes and colors due to redshift ( the `` k''-correction ) .",
    "this complicates the measurement of the smaller effect due to evolution of ( the stellar populations of ) the lens galaxies .",
    "rusin et al .",
    "( 2003 , hereafter r03 ) study the same sample of lens galaxies , with recent photometric observations included .",
    "they convert the data from observed filters into magnitudes in standard restframe bands , so that the evolution of the @xmath3 ratio that follows from the fp ( under the usual assumption that early - type galaxies are a homologous family ) can be investigated instead of the evolution within the fp .",
    "this clarifies the analysis and allows for direct comparison of the results with those of other fp studies . from their @xmath3 evolution analysis r03",
    "find a ( 2@xmath21 ) lower limit @xmath22 for the formation of the stars in lens galaxies .",
    "although this limit is more precise , it is similar to that of k00 .",
    "hence , r03 also conclude that the evolution measurements favor old stellar populations among field galaxies , like those of cluster galaxies , and argue against significant episodes of star formation at @xmath23 , as predicted by the semi - analytical hierarchical models .    for the analysis in this paper we use the tabulated data of k00 , extended with the recent photometric measurements as given by r03 .",
    "we convert the observed surface brightnesses and colors to the restframe johnson @xmath1 and gunn @xmath2 bands .",
    "our transformation to restframe differs from that of r03 . in both approaches the modeled color between restframe band and observed filter is used to convert the observed magnitude into an estimate of the restframe magnitude . r03",
    "obtain the modeled color for a given spectral energy distribution , whereas we use the observed color between a pair of filters to interpolate between the modeled colors for four different spectral types ( fig .",
    "[ fig : magtrafo ] ) .",
    "moreover , while r03 use the ( weighted ) contribution of all observed magnitudes to determine the restframe magnitude , we select the best one with small observational error and filter close to the ( redshifted ) restframe band .",
    "hence , the model dependence of our correction is small and we exclude observed magnitudes with large uncertainties , minimizing the error in the resulting restframe magnitude .",
    "we analyze the @xmath3 evolution of the lens galaxies and compare our results with those of r03 and with results from previous studies",
    ". additionally , we test whether age differences between the lens galaxies are significant .",
    "to this end , we study the scatter in both the @xmath3 evolution and the restframe colors of the lens galaxies , and investigate whether the deviations are correlated .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : fppar ] we determine the fp parameters , using the lensing geometry to estimate the velocity dispersion .",
    "the transformation from observed to restframe bands is described in section [ sec : trafo2restrame ] . in section [ sec : fpandmlevo ] , we construct the fp of the lens galaxies and present the @xmath3 evolution derived from the fp .",
    "we estimate the age of the stellar populations of the lens galaxies by fitting single burst models to the @xmath3 evolution in section [ sec : ages ] . in section [ sec :",
    "colors ] we study the colors of the lens galaxies .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in section [ sec : discconcl ] . unless stated otherwise we assume @xmath24 and a flat cosmology with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "we note that our results are not dependent on the value of the hubble constant .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      we have demonstrated that the @xmath3 evolution of lens galaxies can not be fitted with models that provide good fits to cluster galaxies .",
    "the fit clearly improves if lens galaxies are allowed to be systematically offset from cluster galaxies due to metallicity differences or other systematic effects .    if we consider both this offset and the stellar formation epoch of the lens galaxies as free parameters , the best - fit single burst model in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 band are consistent .",
    "the resulting offset is not significantly different from zero , and although the best - fit stellar formation redshift implies for lens galaxies on average a younger stellar population than for cluster galaxies , the resulting ( @xmath25 ) range of @xmath26 is not significantly different from the formation epoch for cluster galaxies of @xmath27 for the full range from no to maximum progenitor bias correction .",
    "if we impose the constraint that galaxies of the same age have the same @xmath3 ratio irrespective of their environment , we find stellar formation redshifts for the lens galaxies of @xmath28 if the stars in cluster galaxies formed at @xmath29 ( maximum progenitor bias ) , and @xmath30 if the stars in cluster galaxies formed at @xmath31 ( no progenitor bias ) . in the latter case",
    "the stellar populations of the lens galaxies are significant younger ( 1015@xmath12 at the present epoch ) than those of the cluster galaxies .",
    "if the local @xmath3 offset between lens and cluster galaxies is allowed to vary , r03 find for the stellar formation redshift of the lens galaxies a ( @xmath25 ) range of @xmath32 from their @xmath1 band analysis .",
    "although we find a range of @xmath33 ( model a , @xmath1 band ) which implies on average a somewhat younger stellar population , the results are consistent .",
    "r03 conclude that the @xmath3 evolution rates they measure favor old stellar populations for the lens galaxies with a mean formation redshift @xmath34 at a @xmath35 confidence level .",
    "we find a lower @xmath35 confidence limit of @xmath36 .",
    "to test the hypothesis whether the @xmath3 evolution of the lens galaxies can be fitted with a single burst model , we calculate the reduced @xmath37 .",
    "we also compare the measured scatter around the fit with the expected scatter from the uncertainties in the @xmath3 ratios of the lens galaxies .",
    "if we allow more freedom in the single burst models , the fit improves ( lower reduced @xmath37 ) and the measured scatter decreases .",
    "however , even the over - all best - fit single burst model is rejected with @xmath38 confidence and the measured scatter of @xmath39 and @xmath40 in @xmath1 and @xmath2 band is significant higher than the expected scatter of @xmath41 from the observational errors . to establish whether the additional scatter is due to a significant spread in ages among field galaxies , we study in the next section the ( restframe ) colors of the lens galaxies , and investigate if there is also a significant scatter in the color and if it is correlated with the scatter in their @xmath3 ratios .",
    "if the stellar populations of lens galaxies are on average younger than those of cluster galaxies ( section [ sec : ages ] ) we expect their colors to evolve more rapidly and to be on average bluer than those of cluster galaxies . for single burst stellar populations",

    "[ fig : color ] shows the restframe @xmath42 colors of the lens galaxies versus redshift . for the lens galaxies with open circles ,",
    "a modest extrapolation was required in the transformation to either the restframe @xmath1 or @xmath2 band .",
    "the red outlier ( at @xmath46 ) is the lens bri0952 - 0115 , for which the observed @xmath47 ( f675w - f160w ) color is significantly redder than the modeled e / s0 color , and for which we had to extrapolate in the transformation to restframe @xmath1 band .",
    "the single burst evolution of a stellar population formed at the mean cluster formation epoch of @xmath29 ( maximum progenitor bias ) , is drawn ( solid line ) through the averaged color of the coma cluster galaxies ( small dot ) .",
    "a decline in the colors of the lens galaxies with increasing redshift is visible , in spite of the large scatter .",
    "if we fit single burst models as in section [ sec : ages ] ( model a and b ) , we find on average a younger stellar formation epoch for the lens galaxies , but the difference with the cluster galaxies is never significant . in case",
    "the stellar populations of field and cluster galaxies are assumed to evolve in the same way ( model b ) , the evolution model with the best - fit stellar formation redshift of @xmath48 is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "similarly as for the single burst model fits to the @xmath3 evolution , the fits to the color evolution are rejected with @xmath38 confidence , and the measured scatter is in all cases significantly higher than the expected scatter from the observational errors in the restframe colors of the lens galaxies .    to further investigate the scatter in color ,",
    "we subtract the predicted colors of cluster galaxies with @xmath49 , from the restframe colors of the lens galaxies . note that this choice of formation redshift corresponds to the _ minimum _ age difference between field and cluster galaxies . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] we show the resulting residual colors plotted against velocity dispersion , with a linear fit to the coma cluster galaxies .",
    "the lens galaxies show a large spread in their reduced colors , and are on average bluer by @xmath50 mag than the cluster galaxies .",
    "the bluer average color is qualitatively consistent with the on average younger ages of lens galaxies derived from the single burst model fits above and from the fits to the @xmath3 evolution ( section [ sec : summaryresults ] ) . for the total sample of 26 lens galaxies , we measure a scatter in the residual colors of @xmath51 , that is significant higher than the expected scatter of @xmath52 . from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : color ] , we observe that the color scatter increases beyond @xmath53 . for the 15 lens galaxies with @xmath54 we measure a scatter of @xmath55 , whereas for the lens galaxies with @xmath56 the measured scatter is only @xmath57 and nearly identical to the expected scatter of @xmath40 from the errors in the colors of these galaxies",
    ".    the additional measured scatter in the residual colors of the lens galaxies may indicate a significant spread in the ages of the stellar populations of the lens galaxies .",
    "we test whether the color spread is caused by a spread in ages or other effects , by investigating whether the residual colors correlate with the residual @xmath3 ratios . in fig .",
    "[ fig : colvsml ] we plot the color of the lens galaxies against the logarithm of their @xmath3 ratio . for both quantities",
    "the expected evolution of a stellar population formed at @xmath49 was subtracted ; hence a galaxy with the average color and @xmath3 ratio of galaxies in coma would be located at the origin . from eq .   and",
    "it follows that a linear relation is expected in fig .",
    "[ fig : colvsml ] , with a ( time - independent ) slope of @xmath58 ( solid line ) .",
    "the data appear to be correlated in the expected sense , albeit with large scatter .",
    "to test whether the correlation is significant we used the spearman s rank - order correlation coefficient @xmath59 .",
    "we find that @xmath60 , so that with @xmath61 lenses , we can reject the hypothesis that the two quantities are uncorrelated with @xmath62 confidence .",
    "the only viable explanation for the correlation is age variation .",
    "if the correlation would be caused by metallicity variations , ( some ) field galaxies would be much less metal rich than cluster galaxies , opposite to the result by kuntschner et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    the colors and @xmath3 ratios of the bluest lens galaxies are best fitted with stellar formation redshifts as low as @xmath13 .",
    "about half the lens galaxies are consistent with an old cluster - like stellar population with stellar formation redshift @xmath63 .",
    "if galaxies form in a sequence of bursts , formation redshifts are indicative of the last prominent epoch of star formation .",
    "the galaxies can have older underlying stellar populations .",
    "we studied the evolution of the @xmath3 ratios of lens galaxies in the restframe johnson @xmath1 and gunn @xmath2 bands . for an flat cosmology with @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ", we obtained an evolution rate @xmath4 of @xmath5 in restframe @xmath1 and @xmath6 in restframe @xmath2 .",
    "due to differences in the determination of the fp parameters and the corresponding errors , the evolution rate obtained by r03 of @xmath64 is slightly slower but not significant different .",
    "our results are consistent with determinations for field galaxies based on direct spectroscopic measurements of the velocity dispersions . for the @xmath1 band , van dokkum et al .",
    "( 2001 ) arrive at an evolution rate of @xmath65 , and treu et al.(2002 ) find a value of @xmath66 .",
    "the weighted mean of these results and our result yields an evolution rate for field early - type galaxies of @xmath67 in the @xmath1 band . for cluster galaxies van dokkum et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and vdf01 find an evolution rate between @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for minimum and maximum progenitor bias respectively .",
    "the latter value is not significantly different from the average evolution rate for the field galaxies .",
    "we further investigated the @xmath3 evolution in section [ sec : ages ] , where we related it to stellar population ages by fitting simple single burst models for a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf and solar metallicity .",
    "the @xmath3 evolution of cluster galaxies is well approximated by a mean single burst formation redshift of @xmath70 , and @xmath71 after maximum progenitor bias correction ( vdf01 ) .",
    "we first tested if these cluster models could fit the @xmath3 evolution of the lens galaxies .",
    "this is not the case , but the fits improve if there is a systematic offset between lens and cluster galaxies of @xmath72 in @xmath73 such an offset could be caused by , e.g. metallicity variations , systematic differences in the velocity dispersions due to the different measurement techniques , or other effects .",
    "it is interesting to note that hierarchical models have predicted such a constant offset with redshift between cluster and field galaxies ( see van dokkum et al .",
    "however , similar to van dokkum et al.(2001 ) , we conclude that the observed offset is much smaller than the predicted offset of @xmath74 .",
    "if we next allow the stellar formation redshift @xmath75 also to vary , we find for the best - fit single burst model that the offset is not significant from zero , together with a mean stellar formation epoch @xmath76 for the lens galaxies of @xmath77 in the @xmath1 band and @xmath10 in the @xmath2 band .",
    "this means that on average the stellar populations of the lens galaxies are younger , but the difference with the cluster galaxies is not significant .",

    "is not anymore significant .    from their analysis",

    "all single burst models are rejected with @xmath38 based on the reduced @xmath37 , and the measured scatter is in all cases significant higher than the expected scatter from the observational errors .",
    "the additional scatter is most likely caused by differences in the stellar population of the lens galaxies .    to investigate whether there is a significant spread in ages , we studied in section [ sec : colors ] the restframe colors of the lens galaxies and their evolution .",
    "the colors of the lens galaxies are on average bluer than those of the cluster galaxies , consistent with on a younger average stellar population .",
    "we found that the measured scatter in the single burst fits to the colors is much larger than the expected scatter from the observational errors .",
    "moreover , we showed that there is a significant correlation between the colors and the @xmath80 ratios of the lens galaxies .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for a significant spread in the stellar population ages of the lens galaxies .    whereas about half of the lens galaxies are consistent with old cluster - like stellar populations , the bluest galaxies are best fit by single burst models with young stellar formation redshifts @xmath13 .",

    "for the @xmath2 band even six of the seven blue galaxies are best fitted by the scd spectral type , instead of the es/0 spectral type .",
