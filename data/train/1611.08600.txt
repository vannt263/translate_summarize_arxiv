    "given the robust nature of the scatter , individual outliers in the @xmath6 relation can provide valuable tests of the general  galaxy formation paradigm .",
    "halos classified as `` fossil groups '' are promising locations to search for such outliers .",
    "fossil groups were originally conceived to be the end states of group formation  @xcite where all the large galaxies merged via dynamical friction into a single large central galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "the entire merger history of the group was then contained within the bcg itself , and so the `` group '' could then be identified with the bcg .",
    "the longer cooling time of the hot gas means the bcg is surrounded by a luminous x - ray halo characteristic of a group - scale dm halo . as such , these `` classical '' fossil groups were presumed to be ancient , highly relaxed , and evolved systems .",
    "a considerable amount of work has been done over the past 10 + years characterizing the properties of fossil groups .",
    "the conception of a fossil now is broader than when initially discovered by @xcite and includes more massive clusters ; i.e. , a fossil system is now typically defined as ( at least ) a 2 magnitude gap ( @xmath13-band ) between the bcg and next brightest member and possessing a bolometric @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "if fossil systems truly formed earlier than the general population , they should possess systematically higher halo concentrations .",
    "for the nfw profile  @xcite , which is the standard function employed to parameterize  dm halos , the concentration is defined as , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the scale radius and @xmath18 is the radius within which the mean density is @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the critical density of the universe at the redshift of the halo and typically @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite argued that @xmath11 is set by the mean density of the universe at the redshift of halo formation , so that halos with higher concentrations formed earlier than halos with lower concentrations .",

    "using a modest  acis - s observation for the nearby fossil group ngc 6482 , @xcite presented intriguing evidence for an extremely high concentration value @xmath22 compared to the mean  @xmath6 relation  ( @xmath23 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from which they inferred a very early formation time ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that since @xcite did not include a separate component for the stellar mass of the bcg in their hydrostatic equilibrium analysis , the concentration they measured was likely overestimated .",
    "indeed , when including the stellar mass in our analysis of the  data , we obtained a much smaller , though very uncertain , value for @xmath3 that was dependent on assumptions about the baryon fraction profile  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter h06 ) .    a proper interpretation of the measured halo concentration must also account for the halo response to baryons during galaxy formation .",
    "the key process leading to the steepening of the inner dm halo mass profile is `` adiabatic contraction ''  ( ac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the baryons dissipate rapidly onto the central galaxy , but the dm evolves more slowly . in particular , a discrepancy between the halo concentration as given by the mean @xmath6 relation deduced from cosmological simulations that include only dm  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the @xmath11 measured from observations using the standard nfw profile , in principle can be mitigated if instead the observations are interpreted with an adiabatically contracted nfw profile .",

    "h06 and @xcite fitted the modified ac model of @xcite to a total of 22 massive elliptical galaxies and group - scale systems .",
    "both of these studies found the ac model to be modestly disfavored compared to the pure nfw profile , since the ac model tended to yield bcg stellar mass - to - light ratios uncomfortably small compared to stellar population synthesis estimates .",
    "ac model fits to the hot gas of the group / cluster rxcj2315.7 - 0222 by  @xcite are compatible with the data but are not clearly favored over the pure nfw profile because of degeneracies in the assumed stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "ac models are clearly excluded by the x - ray data of the galaxy cluster a2589  @xcite . a similar lack of evidence supporting ac occurs from lensing and stellar dynamical studies . while initially several studies found ac models to be favored  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "as is readily apparent from figures  [ fig.chandra ] and [ fig.suzaku ] , the broad `` hump '' near 1  kev composed of an unresolved forest of emission lines from iron l - shell transitions is the dominant spectral line feature . after iron , for @xmath83  kev the strongest line features arise from @xmath84-shell transitions of o , ne , mg , si , and s. for both  and , the o , ne , and mg lines are heavily blended with the strong , highly temperature - sensitive fe - l lines . consequently , in our spectral model these weaker , unresolved lines may attempt to partially compensate for inaccuracies in the fe - l lines due to , e.g. , plasma code deficiencies or the assumed temperature structure that gives rise to the fe bias  ( @xcite ; see also  @xcite ) ; i.e. , the underestimate of the iron abundance when assuming a single plasma temperature when in fact multiple temperature components are present arising from , e.g. , a range of temperatures due to the projection along the line of sight of a radial temperature gradient . the si and s lines do not suffer from blending with the fe l shell lines , but they are contaminated by strong lines in the particle background . therefore , by default we assume a single temperature component for each spectrum and allow the iron abundance to be fitted freely while restricting the other metal abundances to vary in their solar ratios with respect to iron ; e.g. , for silicon , the quantity @xmath85 is fixed at the solar ratio . for completeness , however , we also examine the effects of allowing the non - fe abundances to be varied separately and adding additional temperature components .",
    "by default we employ the solar abundance standard of  @xcite .",
    "a weaker source of emission arises from unresolved discrete sources in the galaxy , especially from low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "we represent the spectrum of these unresolved point sources by a thermal bremsstrahlung component with @xmath86  kev and assume it follows the stellar mass by requiring the relative fluxes in the different annuli to obey the @xmath84-band light profile (  [ stars ] ) .",
    "we only include this model interior to @xmath87 ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) which corresponds to annuli 1 - 6 for  and the inner annulus @xmath89 for .",
    "based on the @xmath84-band luminosity , the expected 0.3 - 7.0  kev luminosity within @xmath87 from the lmxbs is , @xmath90  erg  s@xmath15 , using the scaling relation of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.e. , their equation 8) .    for the  data we obtain a fitted value consistent with the scaling relation . for the  data our best - fitting value is @xmath91  erg  s@xmath15 ;",
    "i.e. , about @xmath92 above the predicted value . given the nature of our complex , multi - component spectral model with source and background emission , the lmxb component is somewhat degenerate with the cxb and particle packground models , which likely accounts for the possible discrepancy .",
    "consequently , by default for the  spectral fitting we fixed @xmath93 at the predicted value from the scaling relation and treated as a systematic error the case where @xmath93 is allowed to be freely fitted (  [ misc.spec ] ) .",
    "we account for the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) with several model components .",
    "the soft portion of the cxb consists of emission from the local hot bubble ( lhb ) and hot plasma associated with the disk and halo of the milky way  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the temperatures associated with these components @xmath94  kev ) are well below the band - pass of our observations , we find that at most two separate soft components are needed , as in , e.g. , @xcite . as we did in @xcite",
    ", we include separate components for the lhb ( unabsorbed apec component with @xmath95  kev and solar abundances ) and the halo gas ( absorbed apec component with @xmath96  kev and solar abundances ) .",
    "the hard portion of the cxb is dominated by unresolved agn which we model as a power - law with index @xmath97  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as mentioned above in  [ suzaku ] , we adopt a standard model for the particle background and subtact it from the  spectra before fitting . for , however , we parameterize the particle background with a simple broken power - law model and several gaussian components  none of which are folded through the arf ( i.e. , the particle background model components are `` un - vignetted '' )  which we find is sufficient to provide an acceptable description of the data .",
    "in particular , to obtain a good fit for the particle background for annuli 1 - 10 ( which lie mostly on the bi chip s3 ) we added three gaussian components with best - fitting central energies , 1.81 , 2.17 , and 2.88  kev .",
    "their emission is easily seen in the spectrum of annulus  10 shown in figure  [ fig.chandra ] . for annulus  11 , which spans three fi chips , the most important gaussian component we added has energy 2.17  kev , though we also added minor components at 1.49  kev and 2.51  kev .",
    "we required the cxb to be uniform across the field .",
    "therefore , we tied all cxb parameters for all annuli and insured that the fluxes of the cxb model components were the same in each annuli when rescaled to the aperture area .",
    "the same was done for the  particle background model .",
    "we experimented with allowing the particle background normalizations to vary separately for each annulus and found the results were not changed significantly .",
    "in addition to background and lmxb components , the fiducial spectral model described above (  [ specmod ] ) consists of a single coronal plasma component for each annulus where only the temperature , normalization , and iron abundance ( all other elements tied to iron in their solar ratios ) are allowed to vary .",
    "we find this fiducial model provides a good overall fit to the data with a minimum c - statistic of 631.85 for 595 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "this best fit also translates to a reduced @xmath98 with a null hypothesis probability of 12% , indicating a formally acceptable fit .",
    "the good quality of the global fit is on display in figure  [ fig.chandra ] where we show the best - fitting model over - plotted on the spectra in four of the annular regions .",
    "for the hot gas we list the surface brightness ( @xmath99 ) , temperature ( @xmath100 ) , and @xmath101 for each annulus in table  [ tab.gas ] and plot the radial profiles of @xmath99 and @xmath100 in figure  [ fig.best ] .",
    "we define @xmath99 to be the 0.5 - 7.0  kev flux ( erg @xmath60 s@xmath15 ) of the gas emission in the aperture divided by the aperture solid angle taken to be @xmath102 ( arcmin@xmath103 ) .",
    "the temperature profile peaks at the center ( @xmath104  kev ) and decreases with radius until flattening out in the last two bins ( 9 - 10 ) with a slight hint of an upturn that is more pronounced in the  spectra (  [ spec_suzaku ] ) .",
    "the shape of the declining temperature profile agrees well with our previous study of  by h06 using similar models and data reduction methods .",
    "however , the temperatures we have measured here systematically exceed those reported by h06 by @xmath105 , while our iron abundances are much smaller . in our present study",
    "the  plasma emission code uses the current version ( 2.0.2 ) of the atomic database atomdb , whereas h06 used version 1.3.1 .",
    "we find that if we force  to use atomdb version 1.3.1 , then we obtain results that are overall very consistent with those of h06 .",
    "even though we obtain a fit that is formally acceptable , we examined whether the fit could be improved further .",
    "perhaps the most notable fit residuals occur between 0.5 - 0.6  kev for annulus 1 , and also annuli 3 - 4 ( not shown ) , where the model over - predicts the data by @xmath106 with 2-@xmath107 significance .",
    "( excluding these bins does not affect the fitted parameters much . )",
    "other notable , but less significant , residuals occur in the fe - l region ( i.e. , 0.7 - 1.4  kev ) at approximately the @xmath108 level for annuli 1 - 6 .",
    "these features are characteristic of the fe bias (  [ galmod ] ) , but since the annular widths are fairly small , the effect is not highly significant ; for a more detailed study of the effect of aperture width on the fe bias , see , e.g. , the case of ngc  5044  @xcite .",
    "indeed , we find that adding a second temperature component leads to only a marginal improvement in the fit while leading to much more poorly constrained gas parameters .",
    "we also find that essentially the same reduction in the c - statistic obtained by adding a second temperature component can be achieved instead by allowing some other elemental abundances to be varied separately from iron . since the abundances of these other elements are not as well constrained as iron , we tied their values for all annuli .",
    "when doing so , the largest fit improvement occurs for ne , mg and si respectively for which we obtain the following abundance ratios ( in solar units ) : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "since we expect that these non - solar abundance ratios reflect to a large extent the fe bias , we treat this variable abundance case as a systematic error for the mass models (  [ misc.spec ] ) .",
    "the  data from all annuli and all instruments ( xis0 , xis1 , xis3 ) are fitted simultaneously . to account for any relative calibration uncertainties between the detectors , we allow the relative normalizations of the model components for the xis1 and xis3 to vary with respect to the xis0 through the use of additional multiplicative constants .",
    "the strong temperature gradient measured by  within the region of annulus  1 ( i.e. , @xmath112 , see table  [ tab.gas ] ) compels us to consider multiple temperatures there so that the spatial mixing between annuli due to the large psf is sufficiently accurate in our model for all annuli . like our previous study of rxj  1159 + 5531  @xcite , for this purpose we adopted a simple two - temperature model ( 2 t ) , since we have shown previously that such a simple model provides a good description at ccd resolution of the integrated spectrum in a region containing a radial temperature gradient  @xcite .",
    "the 2 t model improves the global fit modestly ( i.e. , @xmath113 , @xmath114 for 1136 dof and 3 additional parameters ) , so that the gas parameters in the other annuli are also modestly affected .",
    "for example , in annulus  2 , @xmath100 rises from 0.47  kev ( 1 t ) to 0.57  kev ( 2 t ) , the difference of which is @xmath115 significant .",
    "we therefore employ the 2 t model in annulus  1 ( and 1 t models in annuli  2 and 3 ) for the fiducial model of the  spectra and treat the case of using the 1 t model in annulus  1 as a systematic error (  [ misc.spec ] ) .    whereas we obtain tight constraints on the gas parameters in annulus  1 for a 1 t model ( e.g. , @xmath116  kev , @xmath117 ) , for the 2 t model the temperatures for each component are not very well constrained .",
    "in fact , the emission - weighted parameters of the 2 t model ( e.g. , @xmath118  kev ) have much larger uncertainties than the corresponding  measurements in the same region .",
    "consequently , we find that annulus  1 does not provide tangible constraining power for the hydrostatic models (  [ models ] ) above that provided by the  data , and thus we do not include annulus  1 in our subsequent analysis .    from visual inspection of figure  [ fig.suzaku ] , where we show the best - fitting fiducial model to the spectra in annuli  2 - 3 , it is apparent that the fiducial model provides a good description of the data there , and the strong spatial mixing of the gas components is readily seen .",
    "the best fit yields a c - statistic of 1349.35 for 1136 dof and reduced @xmath119 . unlike the  data , the  fit is not formally acceptable , and we were unable to greatly improve the fit with small alterations to the fiducial model ( e.g. , varying other abundances , see below ) .",
    "the most prominent model residuals occur for annulus  1 ( not shown ) , providing additional justification for not including the parameters of annulus  1 in our subsequent analysis .",
    "we list the parameters for the hot gas for annuli  2 - 3 in table  [ tab.gas ] and plot them in figure  [ fig.best ] .",
    "the parameters of annulus  2 measured by  agree very well with those measured by  in their overlapping region ( i.e. ,  annuli  8 - 10 ) but with larger statistical error .",
    "for annulus  3 , which is mostly exterior to the  data , the temperature appears to rise . though the rise is not very significant ( @xmath120 ) , it is consistent with the hint of a rise in  annuli  8 - 10 .",
    "the isolated elliptical galaxy ngc  1521  @xcite , which has a halo mass similar to , displays a similar rise in temperature near @xmath121 .    allowing the ne abundance to be free yields a super - solar value @xmath122 very consistent with that obtained from  (  [ spec_chan ] ) .",
    "however , for mg and si we obtain ratios , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 , very consistent with solar and , particularly for mg , significantly less than obtained with .",

    "the results of using spectral fits allowing ne , mg , and si to vary with non - solar ratios with respect to fe are listed in the row `` other abun . ''",

    "next we explored the result of performing a standard @xmath81 frequentist analysis for the hydrostatic equilibrium models ( i.e. , as opposed to the default nested sampling bayesian approach ) and list the results in row `` frequentist '' in the tables .",

    "even larger differences are observed when the  data , which extend out the largest radius in our study , are omitted entirely ( `` no suzaku '' ) .",
    "as expected , the differences manifested when omitting the  data increase with increasing radius ; e.g. , @xmath3 increases and @xmath248 decreases at @xmath626 significance .",

    "note , however , that omitting the  data increases the error bar so that @xmath475 formerly exceeds the cosmic value at a lower significance level ( @xmath629 ) .    finally , we considered the effect of fitting the radial iron abundances ( table  [ tab.gas ] ) with a projected , emission - weighted parameterized model that is used in the evaluation of the plasma emissivity @xmath143 (  [ method ] ) .",
    "for the parameterized model we used a multi - component model related to that consisting of two power - laws mediated by an exponential ( eqn .  5 of @xcite ) and a constant floor .",
    "we list the results for this test of the plasma emissivity in row `` @xmath143 '' of tables [ tab.mass ] and [ tab.fb ] .",
    "this is one of the largest systematic effects and induces parameter shifts very similar to the `` no suzaku '' test .",
    "apparently , the parameterized model fit for the iron abundance is dominated by the  measurements at the largest radii because of the large  error bar on the iron abundance ( table  [ tab.gas ] ) .",
    "the smaller  abundances lead to smaller plasma emissivity and higher gas density at large radius .",
    "the higher gas density translates to higher gas and baryon fractions . indeed , if we use the fitted model for the iron abundance , but omit the  data entirely , then the parameter differences with respect to the fiducial model are all insignificant .",
    "thus , the `` no suzaku '' and `` @xmath143 '' tests demonstrate the importance of obtaining more accurate iron abundance measurements at large radius ( @xmath630 ) to obtain robust measurements of the mass parameters , especially the gas and baryon fractions (  [ baryfrac.disc ] ) .",

    "moreover , from visual inspection of figure  16 of @xcite , which shows @xmath3 and @xmath248 obtained from nfw fits to simulated halos , we notice that for the mass of  there are no  halos with @xmath632 .",
    "while the observational error on @xmath3 permits smaller values , the measured @xmath3 and @xmath248 values for the fiducial model with an nfw dm halo represent an extremely rare system formed in .",
    "( note , however , that otherwise the dm profile does not appear to be unusual ; e.g. , ( 1 ) we measure a dm fraction within @xmath633 of @xmath634 for  that is very consistent with other massive elliptical galaxies  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; ( 2 ) the slope of the total mass profile is consistent with the @xmath456-@xmath30 scaling relation within the observed scatter (  [ slope ] ) . )",
    "we plot in figure  [ fig.c - m ] the @xmath3 and @xmath248 values for  and a few other fossil and nearly fossil systems with evidence for above - average concentrations : ngc  720  @xcite , ngc  1521  @xcite , rxj1159 + 5531  @xcite , and rxj1416.4 + 2315  @xcite .",
    "we designate ngc  720 and ngc  1521 as `` nearly '' fossil systems since they obey the fossil classification within their projected virial radii , although typically they are classified as members of larger groups owing to more distant galaxy associations .",
    "there is presently newer and deeper  and  data for the massive fossil cluster rxj1416.4 + 2315 since the time of the initial analysis of a shallow  observation by @xcite . our preliminary analysis incorporating all the available  and  data yields a smaller concentration @xmath635 below the mean @xmath6 relation ( buote et al .",
    "2016 , in preparation ) . our new measurement for  places it as the most extreme outlier in the @xmath6 relation for fossils , with the next largest being ngc  720 ( @xmath627 with respect to the intrinsic scatter ) .",
    "as noted above , if @xmath3 for  is really @xmath636 it would be a very rare system formed in , and perhaps its existence so near to us ( i.e. , representing a small cosmological search volume ) would be difficult for  to explain .",
    "the lower concentrations inferred by the ac models would mitigate any such tension with . while the standard ac prescriptions ( ac1 , ac2 ) yield @xmath174 values for the bcg that are uncomfortably small compared to the sps models , both ac models derived from cosmological simulations ( ac3 , ac4 ) are consistent with the sps models .",
    "the `` forced quenching '' ac variant ( ac4 ) gives the highest @xmath174 of the ac models identical to that obtained for the un - contracted nfw model .",
    "additional support for the ac models comes from their lower baryon fractions in better agreement with the cosmic value once stellar baryons not associated with the bcg are considered (  [ baryfrac ] and  [ baryfrac.disc ] ) .",
    "therefore , while ac4 still produces a significant outlier in the @xmath6 relation ( see figure  [ fig.c - m ] ) , we believe its advantages over the un - contracted nfw model and other ac models make it the preferred model of all those that we have investigated .",
    "the support for ac4 as opposed to ac1 or ac2 provides new evidence for `` weak '' ac and would seem to be consistent with stellar dynamics and lensing measurements of the mass profiles of early - type galaxies that favor no ac or weak ac  ( see  [ intro ] ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is also generally consistent with the x - ray studies of a small number of massive elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups that somewhat disfavor ac1 and ac2 relative to no ac  ( see  [ intro ] ; h06 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the qualitative features and conclusions of the above discussion also apply to when we use the einasto profile for the dm .",
    "the principle difference is that the outlier significance is lessened somewhat with respect to nfw ; e.g. , the pure einasto profile gives a @xmath3 value that is @xmath439 above the mean  @xmath6 relation in terms of the intrinsic scatter , and @xmath637 above the mean for ac4 .",
    "the lower outlier significance partially arises from the larger intrinsic scatter for the einasto profile ; i.e. , 0.13 dex for einasto vs.  0.11 dex for nfw  @xcite .",
    "finally , note that while the halo concentration of  is extreme compared to the other fossil systems , the @xmath13-band magnitude gap between the bcg and the next brightest member is quite typical for fossils ( just over 2 magnitudes ) .",
    "in fact , the @xmath13-band luminosity function of , as well as its color - magnitude relation , appear to be typical of the general group and cluster population  @xcite .",
    "when comparing the @xmath3 we have measured from the x - ray data to theory , we have used the theoretical concentration - mass relations published by @xcite for the following reasons .",
    "( 1 ) it is a recent study using state - of - the - art numerical simulations with up - to - date cosmological parameters from .",
    "( 2 ) the study provides convenient power - law approximations to the @xmath435 relation as a function of redshift for relaxed halos .",
    "( 3 ) results for both nfw and einasto profiles are provided .",
    "moreover , the @xmath638 @xmath435 relations obtained by recent studies are quite consistent for our needs . for example , the double power - law approximation of @xcite for relaxed , mass - selected , @xmath639 halos with @xmath640 gives @xmath641 compared to 7.2 which we obtain from the relation of @xcite for @xmath639 halos .",
    "the relation of @xcite gives a slightly larger value ( @xmath642 ) for halos selected according to the maximum circular velocity ( see tables a1 and a2 of @xcite ) .",
    "another example is provided by the recent study of @xcite who present the theoretical @xmath435 relation for the einasto profile as a function of @xmath643 . using the redshift and best - fitting einasto mass of  ( i.e. , @xmath644 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath645 for the relation published by @xcite compared to the value of 8.1 we obtain from @xcite .",
    "therefore , the uncertainties in the theoretical @xmath435 relation at @xmath646 are considerably less than the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with our measurement of @xmath3 from the x - ray data . as a result , we do not discuss systematic differences in the theoretical relations henceforth in this paper .      whereas previously the global baryon fraction was effectively unconstrained for , with the addition of new  data and an improved hydrostatic modeling procedure we obtain @xmath647 ( i.e. , @xmath648 precision ) for the fiducial hydrostatic model . as mentioned in ",
    "[ baryfrac ] and  [ sys.stars ] , this value is very consistent with @xmath649 , but it only includes the stellar baryons from the bcg . adding reasonable estimates for the non - bcg stellar baryons",
    "increases the baryon fraction to @xmath650 .",
    "this value marginally exceeds @xmath566 ( @xmath629 ) , and various systematic errors could lower the significance ( table  [ tab.fb ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the lower baryon fractions obtained for the ac models ( table  [ tab.custom ] ) mitigate such tension with .",
    "for example , for ac4 , considering only the bcg stellar bayons gives @xmath651 which rises to @xmath652 when including the non - bcg stars ; i.e. , only @xmath626 above @xmath566 . we conclude that the baryon fraction constraints favor the ac models .",
    "( to a lesser extent , they favor the einasto model as well  see table  [ tab.fb ] ) .",
    "this solid evidence for a baryonically closed @xmath653 halo associated with  has important implications for the `` missing baryons problem '' at low redshift  @xcite as it suggests that , at least in massive elliptical galaxy / small group halos , many of the `` missing '' baryons can be located in the outer halo as part of the hot component ",
    "consistent with results we obtained previously for ngc  720  @xcite and ngc  1521  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the baryon fraction at @xmath571 depends strongly on the form of the assumed dm profile ( table  [ tab.fb ] ) .",
    "for both the nfw and einasto models ( i.e. , profiles consistent with  simulations ) baryonic closure is clearly indicated . however , the pseudo - isothermal corelog profile yields a much smaller value , @xmath654 .",
    "while the corelog profile is not motivated by the standard cosmological paradigm , it is consistent with the x - ray data of .",
    "in addition to assumptions about the dm profile , the ability to measure @xmath424 accurately for @xmath655  kev systems like  is limited to a large extent by the accuracy of the iron abundance profile measured within @xmath571 . as discussed in ",
    "[ mischm ] , for systems with @xmath655  kev the plasma emissivity , and thus also the gas mass , are each very sensitive to the iron abundance at large radius where most of the gas mass resides ( see the `` @xmath143 '' systematic error in table  [ tab.fb ] ) .",
    "this issue is particularly relevant when considering that @xcite found that @xmath51-model fits to the radial x - ray surface brightness profile of ngc  720 gave a value for the gas mass at @xmath571 only about half of that we obtained in @xcite using essentially the same methodology as in our present investigation .",
    "while much of the difference undoubtedly can be attributed to the different model types employed in the two studies ( e.g. , the @xmath51 model is equivalent to the corelog potential hosting isothermal hot gas ",
    "see , e.g. ,  2.1.1 of  @xcite ) ,",
    "another key difference is that @xcite assumed a constant metallicity @xmath656 while @xcite assumed @xmath657 for @xmath658 . for @xmath659  kev the factor of 2 higher metallicity assumed by @xcite translates to a plasma emissivity higher by essentially the same factor and a gas mass that is lower by @xmath660 .      to directly quantify the accuracy of the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation requires measurements of the gas kinematics . in the central region of the perseus cluster , which displays large cavities and other asymmetric features in the x - ray image presumed to arise from agn feedback , _ hitomi _",
    "found somewhat surprisingly that the pressure from turbulence is only @xmath661 of the thermal gas pressure  @xcite .",
    "if , as the _ hitomi _ observation suggests , the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation is very accurate in a system like perseus that possesses pronounced x - ray surface brightness irregularities , it also seems likely to be very accurate in  which exhibits a highly regular x - ray morphology ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "consistent with an accurate hydrostatic equilibrium approximation , we find that plausible hydrostatic equilibrium models provide excellent fits to the x - ray data (  [ mass ] ) and the derived high halo concentration (  [ highc ] ) implies a system that is very old and is therefore highly evolved and relaxed .",
    "the value of @xmath662 that we obtain for the bcg from the hydrostatic equilibrium analysis agrees with sps models that assume a chabrier or kroupa imf and also favors a value for @xmath30 close to the upper limit of the systematic range considered ( see  [ stars ] and  [ mass ] ) .",
    "our measurement strongly disfavors a salpeter imf which predicts an @xmath662 that is too high ; i.e. , even when using the upper limit for @xmath30 ( for the fiducial model and ac4 ) we obtain @xmath663 solar which is @xmath664 smaller than the sps value with a salpeter imf ( 1.58 solar ) .",
    "the clear preference for a chabrier or kroupa imf over salpeter is consistent with our previous x - ray studies of massive elliptical galaxies , groups , and clusters  ( h06 , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the possible exception of ngc  720  @xcite",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the preference for different imfs between the x - ray and lensing / stellar dynamical studies likely indicates an unappreciated large systematic error in one or both of the approaches .",
    "since , other than the case of perseus noted above , it has not been possible to accurately and precisely measure hot gas motions directly , it is natural to consider deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium as a leading candidate for a large systematic error . for , however , to account for the almost factor of 2 difference in the stellar mass implied by a chabrier and salpeter imf would require a non - thermal gas pressure comparable to the thermal pressure .",
    "given the evidence presented at the beginning of this section that  is very old and relaxed , we believe that such a large non - thermal pressure fraction is extremely unlikely .",
    "nevertheless , resolving this imf discrepancy provides additional motivation for obtaining measurements of hot gas motions of similar quality to perseus for massive early - type galaxies .",
    "in  [ entropy ] we found that for @xmath658 the entropy profile we obtain for the fiducial hydrostatic model , when rescaled by @xmath665 , diverges from the baseline @xmath233 entropy profile produced by cosmological simulations with only gravity , so that near @xmath610 it nearly equals the original profile ( see  [ entropy ] ) .",
    "this result is generic to all the dm models we investigated ( nfw , einasto , corelog , ac ) .",
    "whereas the good matching of the rescaled profile to the baseline profile interior to @xmath666 suggests feedback spatially rearranged the gas without heating it ( as is found typically ) , the fact that the rescaled entropy exterior to @xmath666 exceeds the baseline profile suggests the feedback raised the temperature of the gas in that region .",
    "this behavior of the entropy profile is very similar to that of the nearly fossil system ngc  1521  @xcite which has a total mass very close to  and has gas temperature and density measurements extending out to @xmath610 .",
    "the entropy profiles of  and ngc  1521 suggest possibly different feedback mechanisms shape the gas interior and exterior to @xmath666 in those systems .",
    "but since other systems like ngc  720 do not display the same behavior  @xcite , the feedback history is not universal .",
    "measurements of the hot gas properties extending out to at least @xmath667 in more galaxies are needed to assess the generality of this result and its possible implications for galaxy formation .",
    "in 2010  observed  for a nominal 46.5  ks providing motivation for us to revisit its uncertain , but possibly extremely high , halo concentration inferred previously from a modest 20  ks  observation  ( @xcite ; h06 ) .  is an optimal target for analysis of its mass profile with x - ray observations because it is nearby and fairly bright with a highly regular x - ray image that displays no evidence of a central agn disturbance ( see  [ intro ] ) . whereas our  density and temperature profiles in h06 only extended to @xmath668 ,",
    "the  data allow these profiles to be measured fully out to @xmath669 leading to tighter constraints on the mass profile .",
    "the improved constraints partially arise from the addition of the  data but are also the result of our hydrostatic modeling approach having advanced since h06 ; i.e. , we implement an `` entropy - based '' hydrostatic method that allows us easily to enforce the additional constraint of convective stability  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the fiducial hydrostatic equilibrium model we employ for our study has the following components : ( 1 ) reference pressure value at @xmath670  kpc ; ( 2 ) entropy proxy profile consisting of a constant plus a broken power - law with two break radii ; ( 3 ) stellar mass of the bcg represented by a sersic model ; ( 4 ) an nfw profile for the dm halo .",
    "the primary method we use to fit the hydrostatic equilibrium models to the data is bayesian nested sampling .",
    "in addition , we employ a standard @xmath81 minimization frequentist approach both to compare best - fitting parameters to the bayesian values and for hypothesis testing .      * * extremely high halo concentration (  [ mass ] ,  [ highc ] ) * we measure @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the fiducial model . for a halo of this mass , the value we measure for @xmath3 exceeds the expected value of @xmath434 for relaxed halos  @xcite by @xmath4 with respect to the statistical observational error , and by @xmath5 considering the intrinsic scatter in the  @xmath6 relation .",
    "this measurement situates as the most extreme outlier known for a fossil system .",
    "a @xmath5 outlier in the @xmath6 relation would represent an extremely rare object , possibly even too rare to form in  simulations when taking into account the small cosmological sampling volume implied by the low redshift of .",
    "we believe this possible tension with  favors ac models since they yield lower @xmath3 values that are modestly less significant outliers in the @xmath6 relation .",
    "we reach the same conclusions when using einasto dm profiles instead of nfw though with modestly lower significances . * * weak adiabatic contraction (  [ ac ] ,  [ mass ] ,  [ highc ] ,  [ baryfrac.disc ] ) * we considered four variants of ac and applied them to the nfw and einasto dm profiles .",
    "we found all the ac models fitted the data equally well in terms of a frequentist @xmath81 analysis .",
    "generally , the ac models give smaller @xmath174 , smaller @xmath3 , larger @xmath248 , and smaller @xmath424 than the un - contracted models .",
    "these parameter differences are strongest for the standard ac prescriptions  @xcite .",
    "we argue the x - ray analysis favors the _ ad hoc _ `` forced quenching '' ac model of @xcite , since not only does it have the advantages of producing smaller @xmath3 and @xmath424 than the un - contracted models , but it also yields the largest @xmath174 of the ac models ( equal to the un - contracted models ) which agrees best with the stellar mass predicted by the sps models .",
    "support for ac that is weaker than the standard prescriptions is not inconsistent with other x - ray studies  ( h06 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or stellar dynamics and lensing measurements  @xcite of the mass profiles of early - type galaxies  ( see  [ intro ] ) .",
    "* * baryonically closed (  [ baryfrac ] ,  [ baryfrac.disc ] ) * we obtain @xmath647 very consistent with @xmath671 for the fiducial model .",
    "when including estimates for the stellar baryons not associated with the bcg , @xmath424 increases and marginally exceeds @xmath671 ( @xmath672 ) . for ac models the discrepancy is weaker @xmath673 .",
    "the solid evidence for @xmath674 in  indicates that at least some of the `` missing baryons '' at low redshift may be located in the outer regions of hot halos in massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "* * surface brightness and temperature (  [ spec ] ) * the @xmath99 and @xmath100 profiles obtained from  and agree well in their overlap region . at the largest radii ( @xmath675 )",
    "there is weak evidence @xmath676 that the temperature profile turns around and begins to rise .",
    "our measurements for  differ significantly from h06 due to improvements in the atomic physics database used by the vapec plasma code . * * entropy (  [ entropy ] ,  [ entropy.disc ] ) * interior to @xmath666 the radial profile of the entropy proxy displays evidence for feedback that has spatially rearranged the hot gas without heating it , very consistent with measurements of other galaxies , groups , and clusters .",
    "this is not the case exterior to @xmath666 , where the entropy profile suggests that feedback has raised the gas temperature . * * pressure (  [ pressure ] ) * the pressure profile of broadly agrees with ( considering the intrinsic scatter ) the universal profile of galaxy clusters  @xcite for radii approximately 0.1 - 0.7  @xmath160 , but exceeds it elsewhere . * * bcg stellar mass and the imf (  [ mass ] ,  [ he ] ) * the stellar mass we infer for the bcg , when allowing for plausible uncertainty in the assumed @xmath30 , agrees with sps models having a chabrier or kroupa imf and strongly disfavors a salpeter imf .",
    "this result agrees with previous x - ray studies of massive elliptical galaxies , groups , and clusters but disagrees with results from many lensing and stellar dynamical studies .",
    "we argue that it is very unlikely the preference for a chabrier / kroupa imf in  arises from a strong violation of the hydrostatic equilibrium approximation . * * dark matter profiles (  [ mass ] ) * the three dm profiles we investigated  nfw , einasto , and a pseudo - isothermal logarithmic potential with a core ( `` corelog '' )  all fit the data equally well in terms of a frequentist @xmath81 analysis . * * slope of the total mass profile (  [ slope ] ) * the total mass profile interior to @xmath677 is very close to a power - law with a mass - weighted density slope @xmath678 .",
    "exterior to this radius the density profile steepens so that @xmath679 for @xmath680 , which is @xmath681 larger than the mean value of the @xmath469 scaling relation  @xcite but is consistent within the observed scatter  @xcite . * * mond (  [ mond ] ) * mond is unable to explain the x - ray data without dm ; e.g. , at @xmath589  kpc the mond dm fraction is @xmath682 considering only the stellar baryons in the bcg which decreases to @xmath591 when including plausible contributions from other stellar baryons . if we use the upper limit on @xmath30 for the bcg , the dm fraction is reduced by an additional 0.09 .",
