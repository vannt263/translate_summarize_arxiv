    "it requires that the temperature must be almost constant in the period of the oscillation of the condensate .",
    "it is expected that the temperature may be almost constant as a function of time at the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) because of the large difference of entropy density between qgp and hadron phases .",

    "the amplified mode ( 174 mev ) at @xmath40 is softer than that ( for example , about 265 mev in one dimensional expansion case @xcite ) at @xmath126 in @xmath3 field because the difference between sigma and pion masses at @xmath2 is smaller than that at @xmath126 .",
