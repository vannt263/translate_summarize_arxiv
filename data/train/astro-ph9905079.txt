    "the point of all statistics is simplification .",
    "the amount of data the world can throw at us would swamp einstein : we have to simplify to survive .",
    "statistics is the art of extracting simple comprehensible facts that tell us what we want to know for practical reasons , from the floods of data washing over us .",
    "consider the fuel consumption of cars , for example .",
    "every car will be different , depending on its model , year , maintenance state , and the aggression level of its driver . to fully characterize the fuel economy of cars in the usa would require a different number for every car / driver combination : that is , more than @xmath0 numbers .",
    "for most purposes , however , such as working out the nation s likely oil usage , these @xmath0 numbers can be replaced with one : the average fuel consumption . an enormous simplification",
    "!    principal components analysis ( pca ) is a tool for simplifying one particular class of data .",
    "imagine that you have @xmath1 objects ( where @xmath1 is large ) , and you can measure @xmath2 parameters for each of them ( where @xmath2 is also large ) .",
    "for example , the objects could be the @xmath1 qso researchers attending a meeting in la serena , and the parameters could be the @xmath2 things you know about each of them : e.g. , their heights , weights , number of publications , frequent flier miles and the fuel consumption of their cars .",
    "let us imagine that you want to investigate how these @xmath2 parameters are related to each other .",
    "for example , do astronomers who spend most of their lives in airports publish more ?",
    "does this depend on how fat they are ?",
    "do people with inefficient cars fly more , or is it only the smart ones ( with lots of publications ) that do so ?",
    "do these correlations represent real causal connections , or it it just that once you get tenure you buy a new car , become fat , stop publishing and give lots of invited talks in exotic foreign locations ?",
    "the traditional way of dealing with this type of problem is to plot everything against everything else and look for correlations .",
    "unfortunately , as the number of parameters increases , this rapidly becomes impossibly complicated .",
    "it is easy to get lost in the web of parameters , each of which correlates more or less well with some combination of the other parameters .",
    "the human brain can cope with two or three parameters easily . by plotting all the different variables against each other separately",
    ", we can just about learn something about 5  7 variables .",
    "but once we are beyond this , the human brain needs help .",
    "pca is specifically designed to help in situations like this : when you know lots of things about lots of objects , and want to see how all these properties are inter - related .",
    "basically , pca looks for sets of parameters that always correlate together . by grouping these into one new parameter ,",
    "an enormous saving in complexity can be achieved with minimal loss of information .",
    "pca is one of a family of algorithms ( known as multivariate statistics ) designed to handle complex problems of this sort .",
    "it was first widely applied in the social sciences .",
    "the most infamous early application of pca was to intelligence testing .",
    "you can test the intellectual ability of people in many ways .",
    "for example , you could give a sample of @xmath1 people a set of @xmath2 exams , with questions testing their creativity , memory , math skills , verbal skills etc .",
    "do people who score well on one test score well on all ? or do the scores break up into sub - groups , such as verbal or logical scores , which correlate well with the scores on other similar tests ?",
    "pca was applied to these exercises , and it was found that nearly all the scores correlate well with each other .",
    "thus , it was claimed , a single underlying variable ( known as iq ) can be used to replace all the individual scores , and once you know someone s iq , you can accurately predict their performance on all the tests .",
    "( see steven jay gould s ` the mismeasure of man ' for a hilarious account of the misuse of this application of pca . )",
    "the task of pca is then , given a sample of @xmath1 objects with @xmath2 measured quantities for each , i.e. @xmath2 variables , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 = 1 ,  , @xmath2 ) , find a set of @xmath2 new , orthogonal ( i.e. independent ) variables , @xmath5 , each one a linear combination of the original variables , @xmath3 : @xmath6 determine the constants @xmath7 such that the smallest number of new variables account for as much of the variance of the sample as possible .",
    "the @xmath8 are called principal components .",
    "if most of the variance in the original data can be accounted for by just a few of the @xmath2 new variables , we will have found a simpler description of the original dataset . a smaller number of variables may point to a way of classifying the data .",
    "more interesting , beyond the realm of statistical description , the pca , by showing which original variables correlate together , may lead to new physical insight .",
    "of course it will sometimes happen that the observed variables are uncorrelated , or at least , lead to no dominant principal components .",
    "that may be useful to know , but not very interesting .",
    "the concept of pca is usually introduced either algebraically , through covariance matrices , or geometrically",
    ". we will first give a geometrical overview , then illustrate with examples and interpretation .",
    "many textbooks on multivariate statistics give rigorous mathematical treatments ( e.g. , kendall 1980 ) .",
    "consider the case of @xmath2 variables .",
    "the data of @xmath1 qsos are represented by a large cloud in @xmath2-dimensional space . if two or more parameters are correlated , the cloud will be elongated along some direction in hyper - space defined by their axes .",
    "large extensions can arise when a few parameters are correlated , or when smaller correlated variations occur for a substantial number of variables .",
    "pca identifies these extended directions and uses them as a set of axes for the parameterization of the multidimemsional space . following the analysis , each qso",
    "can be represented by its coordinates in the new space .",
    "the new axes are identified sequentially : pca first finds the most extended direction in the original @xmath2-dimensional space by minimizing the sums of squares of the deviations from that direction .",
    "this direction forms the first principal component ( often called eigenvector 1 ) , and accounts for the largest single linear variation among measured qso properties .",
    "next we consider the ( @xmath9)-dimensional hyper - plane orthogonal to the first principal component .",
    "we then search for the direction that represents the greatest variance in ( @xmath9)-space , thus defining the second principal component .",
    "this process is continued , defining a total of @xmath2 orthogonal directions .",
    "consider the case of 22 qsos each with measured values of x - ray spectral index @xmath10 ( defined by f@xmath11 between 0.15 kev and 2kev ) , and fwhm h@xmath12 ( full width at half maximum for the broad h@xmath12 emission line ) .",
    "the data points are distributed in an elongated cloud in 2 dimensions , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . it is standard practice to subtract the mean value from each variable , and normalize by dividing by the standard deviation .",
    "one can find the direction of the first principal component axis by rotating an axis to align with the direction of maximum elongation , actually maximum variance , of the data .",
    "the result of this is shown by the dashed line labeled pc1 in fig .",
    "because the points remain the same distance from the origin , by pythagoras theorem , maximizing the variance along pc1 is equivalent to minimizing the sums of squares of the distances of the points from this line through the origin ; these distances are shown as dotted lines .",
    "the distance of a point from the origin , projected onto the direction pc1 represents the value ( score ) of the first principal component for that data point . clearly , pc1 is a linear combination of the original input variables .",
    "the variance of pc1 is 1.764  rather more than the unit variance of the original variables .",
    "the total variance of the sample is the sum of the variances for each variable , in this case , 2 .",
    "because the new coordinates are found simply by rotation , the distance of the points from the origin remains unchanged , so the total variance remains the same .",
    "thus the first principal component accounts for 1.764/2 = 88.2% of the total sample variance .",
    "the remaining variance of the sample can be accounted for by the projection of the data points onto the axis pc2 , perpendicular to pc1  or 0.236/2 = 11.8%",
    ". these projections ( lengths of the dotted lines ) are the values or scores of the second principal component .",
    "we have succeeded in defining a new variable , a linear combination of @xmath10 and log fwhm h@xmath12 , that accounts for most of the variation within the sample ( pc1 ) .",
    "the interpretation of this parameter is a hotly contended topic ( e.g. , pounds , done & osborne 1995 , laor et al .",
    "1997 , brandt & boller 1998 ) .",
    "is pc2 of any significance ?",
    "the astronomer , with knowledge of the measurement uncertainties , may have more hope of addressing this . if the original variables had been uncorrelated , we could still define pc1 and pc2 mathematically , but we would be no better off as a result of the analysis .      lcccccc + pg name & log & @xmath10 & log fwhm & feii/ & log ew & log fwhm + & l@xmath13 & & h@xmath12 & h@xmath12 & [ oiii ] & ciii ] +   + 0947@xmath14396 & 45.66 & 1.51 & 3.684 & 0.23 & 1.18 & 3.520 + 0953@xmath14414 & 45.83 & 1.57 & 3.496 & 0.25 & 1.26 & 3.432 + 1001@xmath14054 & 44.93 &  & 3.241 & 0.82 & 0.85 & 3.424 + 1114@xmath14445 & 44.99 & 0.88 & 3.660 & 0.20 & 1.23 & 3.654 + 1115@xmath14407 & 45.41 & 1.89 & 3.236 & 0.54 & 0.78 & 3.403 + 1116@xmath14215 & 46.00 & 1.73 & 3.465 & 0.47 & 1.00 & 3.446 + 1202@xmath14281 & 44.77 & 1.22 & 3.703 & 0.29 & 1.56 & 3.434 + 1216@xmath14069 & 46.03 & 1.36 & 3.715 & 0.20 & 1.00 & 3.514 + 1226@xmath14023 & 46.74 & 0.94 & 3.547 & 0.57 & 0.70 & 3.477 + 1309@xmath14355 & 45.55 & 1.51 & 3.468 & 0.28 & 1.28 & 3.406 + 1322@xmath14659 & 45.42 & 1.69 & 3.446 & 0.59 & 0.90 & 3.351 + 1352@xmath14183 & 45.34 & 1.52 & 3.556 & 0.46 & 1.00 & 3.548 + 1402@xmath14261 & 45.74 & 1.93 & 3.281 & 1.23 & 0.30 & 3.229 + 1411@xmath14442 & 44.93 & 1.97 & 3.427 & 0.49 & 1.18 & 3.275 + 1415@xmath14451 & 45.08 & 1.74 & 3.418 & 1.25 & 0.30 & 3.434 + 1425@xmath14267 & 45.72 & 0.94 & 3.974 & 0.11 & 1.56 & 3.666 + 1427@xmath14480 & 45.54 & 1.41 & 3.405 & 0.36 & 1.76 & 3.300 + 1440@xmath14356 & 45.23 & 2.08 & 3.161 & 1.19 & 1.00 & 3.192 + 1444@xmath14407 & 45.92 & 1.91 & 3.394 & 1.45 & 0.30 & 3.479 + 1512@xmath14370 & 46.04 & 1.21 & 3.833 & 0.16 & 1.76 & 3.546 + 1543@xmath14489 & 46.02 & 2.11 & 3.193 & 0.85 & 0.00 &  + 1626@xmath14554 & 45.48 & 1.94 & 3.652 & 0.32 & 0.95 & 3.631 +   +",

    "other examples of pca analyses are given and discussed by whitney ( 1983a , b ) , and murtagh and heck ( 1987 ) .",
    "some pcas have a larger number of variables than input observables , @xmath2 @xmath25 @xmath1 .",
    "this results in a singular matrix and therefore requires modifications to the techniques to solve the eigenvector equations .",
    "these techniques are discussed , for example , by wilkinson ( 1978 ) , and mentioned by mittaz , penston , & snijders ( 1990 ) .",
    "this situation occurs in ` spectral pca ' .",
    "the principles are identical , but the number of variables is larger than the number of qso spectra . here",
    "the qso spectra are divided into many discrete bins , by wavelength or log ( wavelength ) ( or velocity ) , and the @xmath2 variables are the fluxes in these @xmath2 bins . an excellent example and discussion of interpretation is given by francis et al .",
    "for another example , see wills , brotherton , wills & thompson ( 1997 ) .",
    "pca also finds application to spectral time variability .",
    "for example , mittaz et al . (",
    "1990 ) analyze the spectra of ngc4151 at 59 epochs , binning each spectrum in wavelength space ( 1375 bins ) .",
    "a more recent example is given by trler & courvoisier ( 1998 ) .",
    "recommended for further reading , is chapter 6 from manly s ` multivariate statistical methods ' ( 1994 ) , which gives a good brief discussion of the method , with useful insights into interpretation . a more rigorous mathematical treatment , together with discussion , is given by _ the _ great researcher and expositor of statistics m. kendall ( chapters 1 and 2 of ` multivariate analysis ' . )",
