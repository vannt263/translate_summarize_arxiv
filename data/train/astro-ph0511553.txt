    "the open cluster trumpler2 is located near the famous rich clusters h and @xmath15 in the perseus constellation .",

    "catalogue it is classified as ii 2p ( a pure cluster with little central concentration ) .",
    "all that was known about the cluster to the present day is based on the data from the washington catalogue `` photometry of stars in galactic cluster fields''(hoag et al .",
    "1961)(hj ) .",
    "for trumpler2 it included ubv photoelectrical photometry of 28 stars in the @xmath21 area and photographic photometry of 133 stars in the circle @xmath22 around the supposed cluster center .",
    "all the contemporary determination of the cluster parameter are based on that data ( fig.1 a&b presented the color - magnitude diagram(cmd ) and the two - color diagram of the cluster from that study ) .",
    "the existence of the cluster itself was not confirmed by any other original papers .",
    "this area was never investigated kinematically on the base of proper motions .",
    "our paper has to fill this gap .",
    "the observational material belongs to the normal astrograph collection of the pulkovo observatory and dates from 1937 to 2000 ( table1 ) .",
    "the scale of the normal astrograph plates is @xmath23 .",
    "the cluster region star positions from the usno - a 2.0 catalogue were used as an additional plate ( epoch 1954.8 ) .",

    "the description of the complex was presented in frolov et al ( 2002)(fja ) .",
    "the positions of the 2362 stars in the area @xmath1 centered on the cluster trumpler2 up to the limit magnitude @xmath24 mag were measured .",
    "positions of some faint stars were not measured on all plates because of the poor quality of their images .",
    "so from three to seven stellar positions were used to derive proper motions(pm ) .",
    "pm were determined by the line - method .",
    "the details of this method were presented in jilinski et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the deepest plate @xmath25 with the faintest images was considered to be the central plate .",
    "it was orientated by means of the stars positions from the `` tycho-2 '' catalogue .",
    "then all the other plates were reduced to this central one . for that reduction",
    "were selected 72 reference stars in the interval between @xmath26 and @xmath27 mag .",
    "the rms errors of derived pm are : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the analysis of error distributions demonstrates that they increased from @xmath30 to @xmath31 with the increasing of the distance from the area center and from @xmath32 for stars with the magnitude @xmath33   mag to @xmath34 for @xmath35 mag stars .",
    "the astrometrical results are given in the table2 which columns contain : 1 - the star number , 2 - the star number from the usno - a 2.0 catalogue , 3,4 - its rectangular coordinates x and y on the plate k376 , 5 - radius - vector , 6,7,8,9 - x and y relative proper motions and their errors , 10 - the number of used plates , 11 - photographical b - magnitude , resulted from the `` fantasy '' measurements , 12 - notes(bl marks blends , bad - bad measurement , abs -absence of the star on the plates , bd and ad - star identification ) .",
    "the selection of cluster members was made for stars located in the circle with the @xmath36 around the cluster center .",
    "that region contains 313 stars with determined proper motions .",
    "blended images and stars measured only on two or less plates were expelled .",
    "the size of this circle was selected according to two reasons : first , it should be large enough for not to miss the cluster members from the corona , second , not be too large to litter the vector point diagram ( vpd ) with a large amount of the field stars .",
    "we used the method in which membership probabilities , magnitude equations ( me ) and parameters of the star distributions on the vector point diagram ( vpd ) were determined step by step in iterative process .",
    "the details of this procedure are described in fja .",
    "the starting selection was realized in the circle with the r@xmath37 centered on the trumpler2 . as a first approximation stars with the photoelectric bv magnitudes from the hj",
    "were considered to be the cluster members .",
    "based on proper motions and magnitudes of these stars the magnitude equation ( me ) was studied and the proper motions of all stars were corrected for it . then at each step characterized by increasing value of r ( + 2@xmath38 ) the parameters of the bivariate gaussian distributions of proper motions , circular for the cluster and elliptical for the field , were computed by the sanders method ( 1971 ) .",
    "the preliminary selection of the cluster members had been made in each iteration step .",
    "then the proper motions were tested for the me . if it had been revealed then all the pm in the catalogue were refreshed .",
    "the latest step was made for the stars in the circle with the radius r@xmath39 .",
    "it is important to note that it is impossible to divide stars of the cluster and of the field on the vpd visually because of the proximity of the centers of their distributions .",
    "this fact is frequently registered for the far clusters ( for example see j. sanner et al.(199,2000,2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless it takes only 8 iteration to reach the stable solution numerically with relative precision e=0.001 .",
    "the following initial values of the parameters were accepted : @xmath40 , centers of the distributions : the field -1 , 1 , the cluster : 1,-1 , the dispersion : the field 12 , 8 , the cluster 4 .",
    "calculations resulted in the following values : the relative number of cluster members and all stars @xmath41 ; centers of distributions : the field @xmath42 , @xmath43 ; the cluster @xmath44 , @xmath45 ; standard deviations : the field @xmath46 , @xmath47 , the cluster @xmath48 .",
    "all the values are in @xmath49 .",
    "they were used to calculate the individual membership probabilities of the stars in the area by the formulae : @xmath50 where @xmath51 - normalized number of cluster stars , @xmath52 - normalized number of field stars , @xmath53 , @xmath54 - proper motion in @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the @xmath57 star .",
    "the resulting histogram shows that the stars with the probabilities @xmath58 can be considered the cluster members ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the whole amount of such stars is 192 .",

    "the final conclusion of the star membership was based on two criteria : its proper motion and its position on the cmd .",
    "only small part of situated in the central circle stars has got the initial ubv - photometry(hj ) .",
    "the @xmath59 and @xmath60 magnitudes of the rest stars were determined partly as by - product of astrometric plate measurements ( image diameters ) or by our original ccd - observations and partly were calculated from the infrared j , h , k magnitudes from 2mass catalogue by the derived transformation formulae . unfortunately due to the technical reasons we were able to obtain ccd - magnitudes only in the area of @xmath61 .",
