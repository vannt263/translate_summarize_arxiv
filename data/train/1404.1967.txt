    "exoplanet surveys like nasa s _ kepler _ mission are discovering planets in a variety of environments , e.g. , systems with multiple stellar components , which suggests that planet formation mechanisms are remarkably robust .",
    "an important result in attempts to understand these planet formation mechanisms is that giant planets are found to be more prevalent around solar - type stars that are typically enriched in metals by @xmath90.15 dex relative to similar stars that have no detected giant planets  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this evidence indicates that giant planet formation is most successful in metal - rich environments .    beyond overall metallicity ,",
    "investigations of abundance patterns in elements besides fe in planet - hosting stars have uncovered evidence that planet hosts may be enriched or depleted ( relative to the sun ) with elements of high condensation temperatures ( @xmath1  @xmath10 900 k , i.e. , the refractory elements that are the major components of rocky planets ) depending on the architecture and evolution of the their planetary systems .",
    "there are at least two planet formation processes that may alter stellar surface abundances : ( 1 ) the accretion of hydrogen - depleted rocky material  @xcite , which would result in the _ enrichment _ of the stellar atmosphere , and ( 2 ) h - depleted rocky material in terrestrial planets may be withheld from the star during their formation , which would result in the _ depletion _ of heavy elements relative to h in the stellar atmosphere  @xcite . for the enrichment scenario ,",
    "@xcite suggest that stars with close - in giant planets ( @xmath90.05 au ) may be more enriched with elements of high condensation temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is thought to be a result of giant planets which form in the outer planetary system migrating inward to their present close - in positions .",
    "as they migrate , they can push rocky material into the host star  . for the depletion scenario , @xcite and",
    "propose that the depletion of refractory elements in sun - like stars may correlate with the presence of terrestrial planets .",
    "certainly there are processes other than planet formation that may alter stellar atmospheric abundances , but these effects can be mitigated by simultaneously considering a pair of stars that have experienced essentially the same evolution and environments over the course of their lives , such as stars in wide binaries .    indeed , wide stellar binaries known to harbor planets are valuable laboratories for studying the connection between how planets form and the chemical compositions of their host stars . since most binary stars are believed to have formed coevally from a common molecular cloud  ( * ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , planet - hosting wide binaries are particularly valuable , because both stars can be presumed to have the same age and initial composition .",
    "in fact , studied the differential fe abundances for a set of 50 wide binaries .",
    "they found that only one binary pair possessed a @xmath11[fe / h ] @xmath12 0.09  dex , while for the majority of the systems they found @xmath11[fe / h ] @xmath13 0.03  dex .",
    "thus , for components of wide binaries where at least one star possesses a planet , it is reasonable to expect that any significant difference in their present - day chemical abundances is most likely due to some aspect of the planet formation process .",
    "for example , the investigation by  @xcite of 16cyg ( a triple system that includes a wide binary pair of two nearly identical stars , plus the secondary hosts a giant planet at @xmath91.7 au while the primary does not ) found that 16cyga  and 16cygb  were chemically identical ( however , we should note that @xcite found that 16cyga  is more metal rich than 16cygb  by @xmath14 dex , but @xcite found that the two stars are chemically identical ) .",
    "the authors speculated that one possible reason 16cygb  formed a giant planet , while 16cyga  may not have , is because 16cyga  itself has a resolved m dwarf companion ( the tertiary in the system ) .",
    "this third star may have truncated the primary s circumstellar disk and inhibited planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the two stars must be the same age , and in addition they were found to be chemically identical , the authors were forced to consider the properties of the system described above , which could have led to these two stellar twins failing to form planetary systems with similar architectures .",
    "the 16cyg wide binary was an ideal first system for this kind of comparison study , because the component stars have almost identical physical properties , i.e. , their masses are nearly equal .",
    "this minimizes systematic errors that may arise from analyzing two stars with drastically different basic stellar properties  @xcite .",
    "ascertaining how planet formation may influence the composition of host star atmospheres could revolutionize target selection for future exoplanet surveys . if chemical abundance patterns can identify a star as a planet host , then a single high - resolution spectrum@xmath15instead of solely relying on large , time - intensive monitoring surveys@xmath15will permit selection of probable planet hosts among nearby stars in our galaxy .",
    "furthermore , if particular chemical signatures indicate the existence of specific kinds of planets , such as terrestrial planets , considerably more targeted searches for solar system analogs would be possible .",
    "the goal of this series of papers is to study the interplay between planet formation and the chemical composition of the host star by directly comparing the chemical abundances of each stellar pair in planet - hosting wide binaries .",
    "this paper presents the analysis of detailed abundance trends in the two stars comprising the hd20782/81  system .",
    "hd20782  and hd20781  are a common proper motion wide binary with an angular separation of @xmath16 and a projected physical separation of @xmath17 au .",
    "they are both solar - type stars with spectral types of g1.5v and g9.5v , and apparent v magnitudes of 7.36 and 8.48 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "for hd20782/81 we present the investigation of the only known binary system where both stars have detected planets .",
    "hd20782  has a jupiter - mass planet on a very eccentric ( @xmath18 ) orbit at @xmath91.4 au  @xcite , and hd20781  hosts two moderately eccentric ( @xmath19 ) neptune - mass planets within @xmath90.3 au ( m. mayor 2013 , private communication ) .",
    "therefore , _ if _ the formation and evolution of planetary systems with different architectures affect the host star composition in distinct ways , studying systems like hd20782/81  allows us to discern which aspects of their architectures play the most important roles .    in section  [ s : data ]",

    ", we adopt the _ weighted _ fits",
    ". however , in figure  [ fig : tc_unweight ] , we provide the unweighted fits for comparisons to previous studies that only reported unweighted fits .    as can be seen in figures  [ fig : tc_unweight]-[fig : tc_weight ] , the slopes of the unweighted linear least - squares fits are : @xmath86 dex k@xmath7 and @xmath87 dex k@xmath7 for hd20782  and hd20781 respectively .",

    "to estimate the impact that the accretion of a rocky planet would have on the atmospheric composition of a solar - type star , we simulated the accretion of a massive body with earth - like composition onto the sun . since jupiter and saturn",
    "are predominantly composed of h and he with approximately solar h / he ratios  @xcite , the chemical composition of a gas giant planet is likely to be fairly similar to the protoplanetary disk , and thereby to the host star . the accretion of gas giant planets , therefore , would be unlikely to produce the refractory element versus @xmath1  correlation observed in some planet hosts .",
    "such trends would be expected to arise only from the accretion of h - depleted rocky material .    to perform our calculation of the expected trend between refractory elemental abundance and @xmath1 , we begin by considering what would happen to the refractory abundances of the sun if it accreted a certain multiple of @xmath93  of refractory material with a composition similar to the earth . since the metallicities of hd20782/81  are consistent with solar ( all elemental abundances are within @xmath90.1 dex of their solar values ) it is reasonable to assume that the primordial abundances of both stars were similar to the present - day solar abundances .",
    "we use the values of @xcite to obtain the mass fraction for each element in the earth . with the mass of the earth , and the molar mass for each element , we can determine an absolute number of atoms for each element . then we add this amount of each element into the solar convection zone and see how the abundances change . given the mass of the sun , the mass fraction of hydrogen , and the fact that at 30 myr ( by which time gas should have dissipated from the protoplanetary disk , and only fully formed planets and a debris disk remain ) the convection zone was 3% of the sun s mass  @xcite , we can determine the amount of hydrogen in the sun s convection zone at that time . using the solar abundances listed in  , the photospheric abundance of each element relative to hydrogen can be determined .",
    "thus , the change in the abundance of each element due to the accretion of a certain multiple of @xmath93  of earth - like rocky material can be calculated .    through the order - of - magnitude calculation",
    "described above , we derived the values for the [ x / h]-@xmath1slopes in each of the accretion scenarios shown in figure  [ fig : tc_acc ] .",
    "for example , if a solar - type star were to accrete 5@xmath93of material with a chemical composition similar to the earth , then from our calculation we would expect a trend with @xmath1  among the refractories that corresponds to a slope of @xmath94 dex k@xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : tc_acc ] ) .",
    "furthermore , as a result of our simulation of a sun - like star accreting earth - like planets , we would _ not _ expect a perfect correlation between abundance and @xmath1 .",
    "there is some scatter about the linear fit to the simulated data , as shown in figure  [ fig : tc_acc ] . indeed ,",
    "some of the elements deviate in a similar manner from the linear fit in both the observed and modeled data .",
    "for example , in figures  [ fig : tc_unweight]@xmath15[fig : tc_acc ] , the elements na ( @xmath1  @xmath9960 k ) , al ( @xmath1  @xmath91653 k ) , and sc ( @xmath1  @xmath91659 k ) are consistently below the fits to both the simulated and observed data .",
    "since these elements are similarly scattered about the fit in both the model and the observations , the scatter in the observed correlation may not solely be the result of observational noise .",
    "there are several ways to extend the above calculation , for example , to take into account differences in the mass of the star , the mass - dependence of the size of the convection zone , and possible variations in the composition of the planets accreted by the star .",
    "such additional considerations could perhaps explain additional scatter in the observed abundances . here",
    "our intent is to illustrate the sense and magnitude of the effect .",
    "however , given that @xmath11@xmath74  @xmath95 k for hd20782/81 , we investigated how differences in the depths of their convection zones would affect the results of our simple model .",
    "using figure  1 from pinsonneault et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which provides a relationship between @xmath74  and the mass of the convection zone , we estimate that for a star like hd20781  ( @xmath74@xmath96 k ) the mass of the convection zone is at most @xmath90.05@xmath97 . using the empirical relationships described in torres et al .",
    "( 2010)which yield the mass and radius of a star as functions of the spectroscopic stellar parameters  we can estimate the mass of hd20781  to be @xmath90.9@xmath97 .",
    "this means that about 6% of the mass of hd20781  is in the convection zone ( as opposed to @xmath93% for stars with masses similar to the sun ) .",
    "thus , while our simulation shows that the ingestion of 10@xmath93  of earth - like material would produce the measured slope for hd20782 , about twice as much material is required to produce the measured slope for hd20781(figure  [ fig : tc_acc ] ) .    ) for hd20782/81 . ]    ) from our modeled accretion of @xmath98 amount of @xmath93  by a solar - composition star ( see section  [ sec : sim_acc ] ) .",

    "the positive trends with @xmath1  seen among the refractory elemental abundances of hd20782/81  may be due to the presence of eccentric giant planets that have migrated to orbits within @xmath91 au .",
    "hd20782  hosts a very eccentric jupiter at 1.4 au , with a pericenter of @xmath99 au .",
    "hd20781  possesses two close - in neptunes at 0.2 and 0.3  au .",
    "these giant planets could have pushed refractory - rich planetary material into their host stars as they migrated inward to their current orbits .",
    "we have shown in section  [ sec : sim_acc ] that compared to a simple model of a solar - type star accreting earth - like material , both hd20782/81  have slopes that are consistent with the ingestion of @xmath100@xmath93  of rocky material .",
    "several studies have performed simulations of giant planet migration that result in a substantial amount of hydrogen - depleted material falling into the star  .",
    "this usually occurs because of planet - planet scattering in a rocky debris disk after the gas - rich protoplanetary disk has dissipated .",
    "found that in 40% of their simulations , giants migrating in debris disk as as result of planet - planet scattering removed all rocky material from the planetary system , most of which was accreted by the host star .",
    "furthermore , for giant planets with a minimum orbital distance less than @xmath91 au , all terrestrial material was destroyed .",
    "both of the planets around hd20781  have semi - major axes @xmath00.3  au , and the eccentric planet hosted by hd20782  has a perihelion distance of only @xmath90.04  au .",
    "therefore the simulations performed by   indicate that both planetary systems should be devoid of rocky material .",
    "in addition , @xcite also noted that over billions of years planets can be driven into their host stars because of the presence of a wide binary companion and kozai resonances . as the binary pair orbits the galaxy , galactic tides can perturb the binary system and change the pericenter . at closest approach",
    ", each star can disrupt any planetary system that may exist around its binary companion .",
    "when  @xcite compared hd20782/81  to wide binaries in their simulations with similar masses and semimajor axes , they found that @xmath955% of the systems like hd20782/81  triggered instabilities , and more that 90% of those instabilities occurred in the planetary system after 100 myr .",
    "these instabilities resulted in planets colliding with the star 14% of the time .",
    "therefore , both perturbations of the stellar binary as well as planetary migration through planet - planet scattering can lead to the ingestion of planetary material by the host star , and thereby generate the abundance patterns which are present in our data and predicted by our accretion model .      our findings , namely that the positive trends with @xmath1  for the refractory elements indicate that both hd20782/81  have accreted h - depleted , refractory - rich material , are consistent with the interpretations of .",
    "in particular , @xcite analyzed abundances versus @xmath1  trends for 10 stars known to host giant planets .",
    "the trends with @xmath1  for these 10 stars were compared to a sample of 121 stars with and without detected giant planets from @xcite ; the distribution of slopes with respect to [ fe / h ] for the @xmath9120 stars from the @xcite sample was interpreted as the general trend from galactic chemical evolution .",
    "of the 10 stars investigated by @xcite , the four with very close - in ( @xmath90.05 au ) giant planets were found to have positive slopes that lie above the galactic trend .",
    "hd20782/81  also have positive slopes that lie above this galactic trend .",
    "the four stars from @xcite were also hypothesized to have ingested refractory - rich planetary material as a result of the evolution of their planetary systems .",
    "however , analyzed a sample of 61 late - f to early - g stars , 29 of which have detected planets and 32 do not . after correcting their trends with @xmath1  for galactic chemical evolution , they found that their stars with and without detected planets possessed similar [ x / h]-@xmath1  slopes .",
    "therefore , they concluded that , in general , trends with @xmath1  may not indicate the presence or absence of planets .",
    "part of the value of comparing coeval stars in wide binaries , is that any _ difference _ in their abundance trends is most certainly not the result of galactic chemical processes .",
    "however , since hd20782/81  exhibit _ similar _ abundance trends , this finding could in fact either be the result of the planet formation process or galactic chemical evolution . in order to distinguish between these two scenarios",
    ", we compared the [ x / h]-@xmath1slopes for hd20782/81  to the distribution of slopes observed for the the @xmath9120 stars in the @xcite sample . among the stars within 0.1  dex of solar metallicity in this sample ,",
    "the slopes of hd20782/81  lie in the upper envelope of the distribution of slopes , which suggests that they are on the higher end of the galactic trend .",
    "furthermore , the fact that they both deviate from the galactic trend in the same way also suggests that their abundances have most likely been changed by a similar process , i.e. , the accretion of rocky planetary material . finally , it is not obvious that galactic chemical evolution can produce the specific element - by - element scatter that we observe ( e.g. , na , al , sc , see section  [ sec : sim_acc ] ) , whereas the planet accretion scenario appears to reproduce it naturally , at least in our current simple model ( section  [ sec : sim_acc ] ) .",
    "@xcite and have performed studies of solar twins ( stars with physical parameters nearly identical to the sun ) , and found that solar refractory abundances decrease as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , since the sun formed terrestrial planets , they posit that a negative slope may indicate the presence of terrestrial planets , which contain the refractory - rich , h - depleted material that would have otherwise been accreted by the host star . since we can rule out negative slopes for both hd20782/81  at the 2@xmath90 level , the interpretation suggested by @xcite and implies that neither star hosts terrestrial planets , which , as noted previously for planetary systems with giant planets at @xmath01 au , is consistent with models of planet migration that predict that both hd20782/81  are unlikely to host rocky planets  .    unlike the work performed by  @xcite on planet - hosting field stars , or the work by @xcite and on solar twins culled from a sample of field stars , or even the work by  @xcite and @xcite on 16cyg , this paper s focus on hd20782/81permits the comparison of two coeval stars that _ both _ have detected planetary systems . the kozai mechanism that is likely the source of the large eccentricity of 16cygb  b  @xcite , is most likely the cause of the very high eccentricity of hd20782  b as well .",
    "however , in the multiplanetary system hosted by the secondary star , the two planets hd20781  b / c can dynamically interact with each other to suppress the effect of the kozai mechanism , and prevent highly eccentric orbits  . thus , while the architectures of the planetary systems hosted by hd20782/81  are not identical , the fact that both stars possess giant planets with pericenters @xmath00.2 au probably resulted in the injection of @xmath100  @xmath93of earth - like rocky material into both stars .",
    "we have performed a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the planet - hosting wide binary hd20782/81 , which is presently the only known wide binary where both stars have detected planets .",
    "the mean element - to - element abundance difference between the two stars is @xmath3 dex , signifying that their bulk metallicities are identical , as expected for a binary system .",
    "both stars show modestly significant ( @xmath92@xmath90 ) positive trends with @xmath1   among their refractory elemental abundances .",
    "we can not definitively rule out that these trends may be the result of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "however , given the orbital characteristics of the stellar binary , and the fact that both stars have eccentric giant planets that approach within @xmath00.2 au , models of dynamical interactions between binary stellar companions and models of giant planet migration indicate that the host stars could have accreted rocky planetary bodies that would have initially formed interior to the giant planets .",
    "this is also consistent with previous studies that found positive trends with @xmath1  in field stars with close - in giant planets .",
    "according to our simple model for the accretion of earth - like planets , the slopes of the weighted fits to these trends are consistent with hd20782  accreting @xmath910  @xmath93and hd20781  accreting @xmath920  @xmath93  of material with earth - like composition .",
    "our model also predicts that there should not be a perfect correlation between refractory abundances and @xmath1  for stars accreting h - depleted , rocky planetary material .",
    "three elements ( na , al , and sc ) are similarly discrepant with both the fit to the simulated data and the fit to the observed data .",
    "therefore , the scatter in the [ x / h]-@xmath1  correlation is not necessarily due solely to observational noise , but may in fact be a signature of the accretion of refractory - rich material driven by the inward migration of the giant planets orbiting these stars . indeed , the specific character of the element - by - element scatter might be used as a strong discriminant between the planetary accretion and galactic chemical evolution scenarios . as we investigate other planet - hosting wide binaries , we hope to further refine these insights into abundances trends and their relation to the planet formation process .",
