    "supersymmetry , if it is realized in nature , must be spontaneously broken on a ground state that is at least metastable , in such a way to comply with the negative experimental searches performed so far . in the context of supergravity theories ,",
    "this has motivated several systematic studies of the circumstances under which metastable non - supersymmetric vacua may arise .",
    "finding such vacua turns out to be surprisingly difficult , even when allowing the freedom of adjusting all the parameters of the theory , because the scalar potential has a restricted functional form in supersymmetric theories .",
    "this difficulty moreover increases with the number of supersymmetries .    one general strategy that can be pursued to uncover possible obstructions against metastable supersymmetry breaking in generic supergravity theories consists of studying the general structure of the masses of the sgoldstini , which represent an endemic danger of instability .",
    "for n=1 theories , this study has been performed exhaustively in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the outcome is that metastable de sitter vacua may exist only if the scalar manifold has a suitable curvature . for n=2 theories ,",
    "the same study has only been carried out in certain special classes of theories . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that metastable de sitter vacua are ruled out in theories with only hypermultiplets @xcite or only abelian vector multiplets @xcite . on the other hand , for the more general classes of theories with charged hypermultiplets or non - abelian vector",
    "multiplets a few examples of metastable de sitter vacua are known @xcite , but no constraint on the existence of such vacua has been worked out so far . for n=4 and n=8 theories ,",
    "a similar study has been done in @xcite , where it was proven that metastable de sitter vacua could only arise in a very constrained region of parameter space .",
    "no genuine examples of such vacua are known in this context , but their existence has not yet been excluded ( examples of unstable de sitter vacua @xcite and marginally stable minkowski vacua possessing flat directions @xcite are known ) . finally , the same kind of study has also been applied to theories defined through a truncation that reduces the amount of supersymmetry , where an unstable de sitter vacuum of the original theory may lead to a metastable de sitter vacuum in the truncated theory .",
    "the simplest case of n=2 to n=1 truncations with only scalar multiplets has been studied in @xcite , and several non - trivial examples in the context of n=8 to n=4 and n=4 to n=2 were described in @xcite .",
    "the same issue of vacuum metastability when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken already arises in the simpler context of theories with global supersymmetry .",
    "one may then also study the problem in this simpler context , without losing any of its essential features , at least for n=1 and n=2 theories where , contrary to n=4 and n=8 theories , one can have a generic scalar geometry even in the rigid limit . moreover , for simplicity one may discard constant fayet - iliopoulos terms , since these are essentially an accidental feature of rigid supersymmetry and are only compatible with gravity under quite restrictive circumstances",
    ". this rigid version of the metastability problem was studied in some detail in @xcite , again using the strategy of looking at the masses of the sgoldstini .",
    "the rigid limit of all the results known from the supergravity analyses for generic n=1 and special n=2 theories were recovered in a simpler and more transparent way .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that in n=2 theories with non - abelian vector multiplets there is no obstruction against metastability from the sgoldstini . on the other hand ,",
    "no constraint has been derived so far with this approach for the general case of n=2 theories with charged hypermultiplets .    in the context of rigid supersymmetry",
    ", one can also use other types of analyses that better exploit the control that one has over the off - shell theory .",
    "for instance , assuming that metastable supersymmetry breaking is possible and that the only massless states are the goldstini , one can try to explicitly construct their low - energy effective theory in which supersymmetry is realized non - linearly .",
    "any obstruction showing up in this attempt can then be interpreted as signaling the impossibility of realizing the assumed metastable supersymmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "proceeding along these lines , it was shown in @xcite that n=2 theories possessing an @xmath9 global symmetry can not admit a genuinely metastable supersymmetry breaking vacuum , at least under the further , more technical assumption that they admit a well - defined supercurrent superfield satisfying a conservation law that involves at most a superconformal linear anomaly multiplet .",
    "this result strongly suggests that a crucial requirement for a generic n=2 theory to admit a viable metastable non - supersymmetric vacuum is that it should not possess any global @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "remarkably , the presence of such an @xmath9 symmetry rests on radically different features in the hypermultiplet and vector multiplet sectors , and this introduces an important distinction between them . in the vector multiplet sector ,",
    "an @xmath9 symmetry automatically emerges whenever constant fayet - iliopoulos terms are absent , even if the scalar manifold is arbitrarily curved . in the hypermultiplet sector , on the other hand , no @xmath9 symmetry can arise if one considers a sufficiently generic curved scalar manifold . as a consequence ,",
    "the simplest candidates for n=2 theories admitting metastable non - supersymmetric vacua are those involving charged hypermultiplets .",
    "following this expectation , it has been shown in @xcite that the simplest class of such theories based on just one hypermultiplet and one abelian vector multiplet with suitably curved scalar manifolds does indeed admit metastable non - supersymmetric vacua .",
    "the aim of this work is to construct a simple , minimal class of n=2 supergravity theories that admit metastable de sitter vacua , without involving either constant fayet - iliopoulos terms or non - abelian gaugings , by generalizing the construction presented in @xcite from rigid to local supersymmetry .",
    "the setup involves one hypermultiplet and one vector multiplet spanning suitably curved quaternionic - khler and special - khler geometries , with an abelian gauging based on a single triholomorphic isometry .",
    "our aim is to construct the most general model of this type and study the circumstances under which this admits a metastable supersymmetry breaking vacuum .",
    "we shall see how this can be achieved by fixing a point in the scalar manifold and then tuning the geometry in the neighborhood of that point such that it corresponds to a metastable de sitter vacuum . as already argued in @xcite , this possibility could a priori depend on the value of the cosmological constant @xmath0 relative to the gravitino mass squared @xmath1 in planck units , and the relevant dimensionless parameter is therefore expected to be given by the following expression , which we restrict for simplicity to be positive : = .",
    "[ epsilon ] more precisely , when @xmath10 the influence of gravitational effects on scalar masses is negligible .",
    "therefore , by virtue of the results derived in @xcite for the rigid limit , it should be possible to achieve a viable metastable vacuum by adjusting the form of the scalar manifolds . on the other hand , when @xmath11 the influence of gravitational effects on scalar masses is a priori significant and the possibility to achieve a viable metastable vacuum by adjusting the form of the scalar manifolds must be reexamined within supergravity .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the main features of n=2 gauged supergravity theories that will be relevant for our purposes .",
    "in particular , we describe useful explicit parametrizations of the most general quaternionic - khler and special - khler manifolds of minimal dimensions four and two in terms of toda and laplace potentials , respectively , which are the main building blocks of our model . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we then review the known properties of the models with only one hypermultiplet and only one vector multiplet that can be constructed with these spaces , and recall specifically the structure of their scalar mass matrices and the sum rules forbidding the existence of metastable vacua . in section 5 we then explicitly construct the class of models involving one hypermultiplet and one vector multiplet that we are interested in . next we compute the structure of the scalar mass matrix and study the constraints that can be put on its eigenvalues .",
    "finally , we derive a sharp upper bound on the smallest scalar mass as a function of the parameter @xmath12 , and deduce from this the range of values for @xmath12 for which metastable vacua are allowed . in section 6 , we briefly discuss the rigid limit of our supergravity analysis and show how it matches the rigid supersymmetry analysis of @xcite . in section 7 , we then present a class of explicit examples of models admitting metastable de sitter vacua and compute for these the full spectrum of scalar masses . in section 8",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "let us briefly review the general structure of n=2 gauged supergravity theories , restricting to abelian symmetries and using planck units . in general , there can be @xmath13 hypermultiplets and @xmath14 vector multiplets . the @xmath15 real scalars @xmath16 from the hypermultiplets span a quaternionic - khler manifold with metric @xmath17 while the @xmath14 complex scalars",
