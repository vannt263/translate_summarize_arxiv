    "the main objective of this work is to study the final fate of charged perfect fluid gravitational collapse in the cylindrically symmetric background .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we discuss the solution of the einstein - maxwell field equations .",

    "this section is devoted to the solution of the einstein field equations coupled with the charged perfect fluid as the source of gravitation distributed per unit length of the cylinder .",
    "the general cylindrically symmetric spacetime is given by the following line element @xmath11 @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "here we take the following restrictions on the coordinates in order to preserve the cylindrical symmetry of the spacetime @xmath27 the proper unit length of the cylinder for the line element ( [ 1 ] ) is defined by @xmath28 the einstein field equations are given by @xmath29 the energy - momentum tensor for perfect fluid is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the energy density , @xmath32 is the pressure and @xmath33 is the four - vector velocity in co - moving coordinates .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field is given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the maxwell field tensor .",
    "now we solve the maxwell s field equations @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the four potential and @xmath38 is the four current . in co - moving coordinate system , the charge per unit length of the cylinder",
    "is assumed to be at rest so that the magnetic field will be zero .",
    "thus we can choose the four potential and four current as follows @xmath39 where @xmath40 is charge density .",
    "the only non - zero component of the field tensor is @xmath41 thus the maxwell field equations take the following form @xmath42 = 4{\\pi}{\\sigma } a^3,\\\\\\label{11 } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial{t}}(\\frac{1}{a^4}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial{r } } ) + ( \\frac{1}{a^4}\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial{r } } ) [ \\frac{\\dot{b}}{b}+\\frac{\\dot{c}}{c}+2\\frac{\\dot{a}}{a}]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where dot and prime indicate derivatives with respect to time @xmath25 and radial coordinate @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "integration of eq.([10 ] ) implies that @xmath43 where @xmath44 , being the consequence of conservation law of charge , i.e. , @xmath45 is known as the total amount of charge per unit length of the cylinder .",
    "it is mentioned here that eq.([11 ] ) is identically satisfied by the solution of eq.([10 ] ) .",
    "we can write eq.([9 ] ) as follows @xmath46 the non - zero components of @xmath47 turn out to be @xmath48    the electric field intensity is defined by @xmath49 we assume that the charged perfect fluid distributed per unit length of the cylinder follows along the geodesics in the interior of the cylindrical symmetry .",
    "this requires that velocity should be uniform and acceleration must be zero which is only possible if @xmath50 is constant and in particular , we take @xmath51 ( for simplicity ) .",
    "thus the field equations ( [ 3 ] ) take the following form @xmath52 we note that there are five equations and five unknowns @xmath53 and @xmath54 , thus we can find a unique solution .",
    "for this purpose , we adopt the method of separation of variables .",
    "the comparison of eqs.([18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) give @xmath55 which yields the necessary condition for pressure to be isotropic .",
    "we take @xmath56 using eq.([21 ] ) in ( [ 16 ] ) , we get @xmath57 where @xmath58 , for non - trivial solution ) is a separation constant while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are integration constants . using eq.([22 ] ) in ( [ 20 ] ) , it follows that @xmath61 since both sides are functionally independent , we put them equal to constant say @xmath62 ) @xmath63 application of eq.([22 ] ) to eq.([24 ] ) leads to @xmath64 the solution to these equations is @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants of integration .",
    "further , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are given by the following relations @xmath70    using eq.([27 ] ) in ( [ 22 ] ) , it follows that @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constants of integration .",
    "thus the metric coefficients , given by eq.([21 ] ) , turn out to be @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , the spacetime ( 2.1 ) takes the form @xmath76 using the following transformations @xmath77 this metric reduces to @xmath78 by assuming @xmath79 , it is clear that the above metric preserves cylindrical symmetry with the restriction on coordinates given by eq.([2 ] ) . here",
    "we take @xmath80",
    "here , we discuss some physical and geometrical properties of the solution .",
    "the physical parameters , i.e. , pressure @xmath32 , density @xmath31 , and the electric field intensity @xmath54 for the metric ( [ 34 ] ) are given by @xmath81 @xmath82,\\\\\\label{36 } e&=&[\\frac{1}{32{\\pi}^2}\\{\\frac{2l(1 + l)^2w^2 { \\sec}^2(wt')-(1+l)^3 w^2-(l-1)^3 s^2}{(1-l^2)^2}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{2ls^2{\\sec}^2h(sr')}{(l+1)^2}\\}]^\\frac{1}{2},\\\\\\label{a37 } \\rho&=&\\frac{1}{8\\pi}[\\frac{-s^2(1+l+l^2+l{\\sec}^2h(sr'))}{(l+1)^2 } + \\frac{lw^2{\\tan}^2(wt')}{(l-1)^2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we would like to mention here that eqs.([31 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ a35])-([a37 ] ) satisfy all the field equations with the restriction on constants given by eq.([29 ] ) .",
    "the proper unit length of the cylinder for the new metric is given by @xmath83 and the longitudinal length in this case is @xmath84    the rate of change of longitudinal length is @xmath85 where negative sign shows that motion is directed inward.@xmath86 thus such motion represents gravitational collapse of the charged perfect fluid distributed per unit length of the cylinder .    in order to analyze the nature of singularity of the solution",
    ", we use the curvature invariants .",
    "many scalars can be constructed from the riemann tensor but symmetry assumption can be used to find only a finite number of independent scalars .",
    "some of these are @xmath87 here , we give the analysis for the first invariant commonly known as the ricci scalar .",
    "for the metric ( [ 34 ] ) , it is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 is given by eq.([39 ] ) .",
    "we see that ricci scalar as well as all the other curvature invariants and physical parameters of the solution are finite for @xmath90 .",
    "thus @xmath91 is the conical singularity of the metric ( [ 34 ] ) .",
    "now we analyze the values of the constants for which the solution is physical . in this solution , @xmath92 and @xmath93 are non - zero separation constants for the non - trivial solution while the rest are integration constants that are removed by applying the transformations to eq.([33 ] ) and by evaluating the physical parameters from the field equations . from eq.([29 ] ) , it is clear that the constants @xmath68 and @xmath69 can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "these are non - zero because @xmath94 for non - trivial solution .",
    "further , for @xmath68 and @xmath69 to be real , there are following four possible solutions : @xmath95 keeping in mind these restrictions on the constants , we find that the cases * 1 * and * 2 * lead to non - physical solutions ( i.e. , negative energy density for the arbitrary choice of coordinates ) . in the case * 3 * , for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , there exists a physical solution which represents the gravitational collapse . the graphs * 1 - 4 * in this case indicate that all the physical quantities become homogeneous .",
    "thus the geodesic model with charged perfect fluid distributed per unit length of the cylinder is free of initial inhomogeneities .",
    "it is interesting to mention here that pressure remains function of time only for the geodesic model that is analogous to the spherical case.@xmath98 in the case * 4 * for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , all quantities except pressure behave like the case * 3 * , in this case pressure is negative indicating a dark energy solution .",
    "as long as the realistic energy condition @xmath101 holds , the gravity remains attractive .",
    "@xmath102 however , the violation of this condition i.e. , @xmath103 due to negative pressure , leads to the repulsive gravitational effects .",
    "thus in the relativistic physics , negative pressure acting as a repulsive gravity plays the role of preventing the gravitational collapse .",
    "we are interested to study the gravitational collapse which is the consequence of attractive gravity , so the case * 4 * is not interesting here .",
    "thus the only interesting case is the case * 3*.    now we proceed to discuss the energy conditions for case * 3 * which are given by the following relations @xmath0    1 .",
    "weak energy condition : @xmath104 2 .",
    "dominant energy condition : @xmath105 3 .",
    "strong energy condition : @xmath106    for the pressure and energy density given by eqs.([a35 ] ) and ( [ a37 ] ) respectively , it follows that @xmath107,\\\\\\label{37 } \\rho - p&&=\\frac{1}{16\\pi}[\\frac{-s^2}{1+l}\\{1 + 2\\frac{(1+l+l^2+l{\\sec}^2h(sr'))}{1+l}\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{w^2}{l-1}(6l\\frac{\\tan^2wt'}{l-1}-\\frac{1}{2l-1})],\\\\\\label{37 } \\rho+3p&&=\\frac{1}{16\\pi}[\\frac{s^2}{1+l}\\{3 - 2\\frac{(1+l+l^2+l{\\sec}^2h(sr'))}{1+l}\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{w^2}{l-1}(\\frac{1}{2l-1}}-10{l\\frac{\\tan^2wt'}{l-1})].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that all these equations satisfy eqs.([3.3])-([3.5 ] ) for @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the rate of change of longitudinal length in figure * 1 * shows that the longitudinal length is a decreasing function of time , thus the resulting solution represents the gravitational collapse.@xmath110 the collapse starts at some finite time and ends at @xmath111 , where longitudinal length of the cylinder reduces to zero .",
    "further , energy density is an increasing function of time shown in figure * 2*. this is the strong argument for a model to collapse .",
    "the pressure in the interior of cylinder starts decreasing as shown in figure * 3*. this causes to initiate the gravitational collapse , more matter is concentrated in the small volume , hence density goes on increasing .",
    "it is to be noted that decrease in the proper unit length of the cylinder , increases the interaction between the electric charges and a strong electromagnetic tension inside the cylinder is created .",
    "this is an increasing function of time as shown in figure * 4*. the coupled action of electromagnetic and gravitational forces play a dominant role to reduce longitudinal length of cylinder to zero .",
    "the nature of the collapse can be seen as follows : when latitudinal and vertical lengths of the cylinder reduce to zero , there is a complete collapse . from the metric ( 2.32 )",
    ", we have @xmath112 . since singularity analysis implies that the ricci scalar diverges at a point where the longitudinal lengths @xmath113 .",
    "thus when the longitudinal length as well as the latitudinal and vertical lengths reduce to zero , we obtain a conical singularity at @xmath114 .",
    "the conical singularity has effects on the gravitational collapse of non - zero mass objects .",
    "the conical singularity belongs to the class of line singularities which are gravitationally weaker than point singularities and stronger than the plane singularities .",
    "the tidal forces for point and line singularities are so strong that these can crush an object of finite size and non - zero mass to zero volume .",
    "however , it was pointed out by nakao et al .",
    "@xmath115 that only conical singularity is the exceptional line singularity which does not crush an object to zero volume that collapses onto it .",
    "hence , it is concluded that massive objects of finite size are collapsed on it without crushing to zero volume .",
    "the reason of non - crushing to zero volume does not imply that tidal forces are weak but it may be due to the geometric structure of the conical singularity .",
    "following,@xmath116 we proceed to cut the spacetime and match it with another spacetime , which represents the exterior region of the collapsing cylinder .",
    "we match the charged perfect fluid solution with the electro - vacuum solution . for this purpose , we consider the darmois junction conditions , @xmath117 which require that the first and second fundamental forms ( that are the line elements and the extrinsic curvature respectively ) must be continuous over the boundary surface @xmath118 .",
    "we assume that the @xmath119 timelike boundary surface @xmath118 splits the two @xmath120 cylindrically symmetric spacetimes @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the metric which describes the internal region @xmath122 is the charged perfect fluid solution given by eq.([34 ] ) . for the representation of the exterior region @xmath121 ,",
    "a charged cylindrically symmetric electro - vacuum solution is taken as @xmath123 @xmath81 @xmath124 where @xmath125 , @xmath93 and @xmath126 are the mass and charge per unit length of the cylinder , respectively .",
    "this choice of the exterior solution in @xmath121 region is compatible with the charged perfect fluid solution in the interior region @xmath122 for their smooth matching over the boundary surface @xmath118 .",
    "now the boundary surface @xmath118 in terms of interior and exterior coordinates can be described by the following equations @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a constant . using these equations , the interior and exterior metrics on @xmath129 take the following form @xmath130dt^2-r_\\sigma^2(d\\theta^2+dz^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume @xmath131 in eq.([c6 ] ) so that @xmath132 is a timelike coordinate .",
    "the continuity of the first fundamental form gives @xmath133^{\\frac{1}{2}}dt=(dt')_\\sigma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the components of extrinsic curvature @xmath134 in terms of interior and exterior coordinates are @xmath135 where dagger @xmath136 and bar @xmath137 represent differentiation with respect to the new coordinates @xmath138 and @xmath139 respectively .",
    "the continuity of the extrinsic curvature components with eqs.([c7 ] ) and ( [ c8 ] ) leads to @xmath140_\\sigma.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here eq.([c13 ] ) implies that the boundary surface @xmath129 represents a cylinder with constant proper unit length which behaves as boundary of the interior charged perfect fluid distributed per unit length of the cylinder .",
    "thus it connects the interior charged perfect fluid solution to the exterior electro - vacuum solution . using this equation , eq.([c14 ] ) reduces to @xmath141 .",
    "the parametric representation of this equation implies that the gravitational and coulomb forces of the system balance each other on the boundary surface @xmath129 .",
    "this consequence in the absence of pressure on the boundary , is equivalent to the result found by thirukkanesh and maharaj.@xmath15",
    "in this paper , we find an analytical solution to the einstein field equations coupled with the charged perfect fluid distributed per unit length of the cylinder . it has been found that all the physical parameters become homogenous but isotropic pressure is function of time only .",
    "this property ( i.e. , pressure being only time dependent ) of cylindrically symmetric geodesic model is similar to the spherical case .",
    "further , all the energy conditions are satisfied for a range of separation parameters and coordinates for which the solution is physical .",
    "all sorts of singularities of the solutions are discussed in detail . it is found that physical singularity of the solution occurs at a point where proper areal radius of the cylinder reduces to zero .",
    "the physical and geometrical properties of the solution such as increase of density and decrease in proper unit length of the cylinder with respect to time represents the gravitational collapse . also , the time interval for the collapse has been investigated .",
    "it is found that the electric field intensity of the system increases with time .",
    "this implies that as longitudinal length of the cylinder decreases , charges come close to each other and the interaction between the charges is increased .    in general ,",
    "it is known @xmath142 that the presence of an electromagnetic field in a geometry causes to disturb its generic properties which may result in the form of oscillation of spacetime . here ,",
    "we discuss the absence of oscillation in geometry by showing the absence of outgoing gravitational waves .",
    "following pereira and wang @xmath143 , the component of the weyl tensor for our solution , is @xmath144 , where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are null vectors .",
    "it means that there does not exist outgoing gravitational waves implying that oscillations are absent in the geometry of the spacetime .",
    "thus there is no energy loss and hence no bouncing .",
    "further , the absence of fluctuations in the energy density graph * 2 * indicates the absence of bounce , oscillation and gravitational waves . the prediction that the fluctuation in energy density represents gravitational waves",
    "is recently made by hussain et al.@xmath147 .",
    "we would like to remark here that in this case electromagnetic field is weak as compared to matter field which is obvious from figures * 2 * and * 4*. this condition ( @xmath148 ) for the weak electromagnetic field was stated by tasagas @xmath149 and used by us @xmath17 to preserve the generic properties of the friedmann universe models . in a paper @xmath150 implies that there exist outgoing gravitational waves from the cylindrical symmetric radiating fluid gravitational collapse .",
    "it would be interesting to find solution of the field equation with radiating fluid and electromagnetic field in order to predict collective role of the electromagnetic field and radiation flux for the existence of the gravitational waves .",
    "the darmois criteria for the smooth matching of the cylindrically symmetric charged perfect fluid solution to an electro - vacuum charged static cylindrically symmetric solution leads to the following consequences : ( a ) boundary surface represents a cylinder with constant proper unit length and behaves as the boundary of the charged perfect fluid distributed per unit length of the cylinder ; ( b ) the gravitational and coulomb forces of the system balance each other on the boundary surface @xmath129 .",
