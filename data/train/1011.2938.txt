    "using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite it has been shown that if an abelian symmetry has been broken outside of a black hole in ads space , scalar hair can form creating a holographic superconductor in the dual cft@xcite . in the last few years",
    "it has been seen that these systems exhibit several characteristics seen in real world strongly coupled superconductors and seem very promising .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence has also been applied to other areas of condensed matter physics @xcite ; some reviews are @xcite .",
    "studying the conductivity of holographic superconductors , horowitz and roberts @xcite noted that at the breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound of the scalar hair of the dual black hole , quasinormal modes appeared to move toward the real axis at low temperatures .",
    "once the back reaction to the metric was included , they showed that the quasinormal modes never became normal .",
    "their number was determined by the height of an effective potential associated with the wave equation of an electromagnetic perturbation .",
    "the study was done numerically which limited the ability to go to very low temperatures .    using the analytic tools developed recently in @xcite , we explore the low temperature regime of holographic superconductors near the bf bound . we find that in the probe limit , when the bf bound is saturated , the condensate diverges at low temperatures as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a constant that we compute and depends on the dimension of spacetime .",
    "this is a very mild divergence which explains why it was not detected in earlier numerical studies @xcite .",
    "it signals the breakdown of the probe limit at very low temperatures , and by including corrections to the probe limit we determine when this occurs . when back reaction to the metric is included , the effective potential associated with the electromagnetic perturbation that determines the conductivity has a finite height .",
    "this results in a finite number of quasinormal modes .",
    "as one approaches the probe limit , the height of the potential increases with an attendant increase in the number of modes .",
    "the latter approach the real axis as the temperature is lowered at frequencies that we compute analytically . in 2 + 1 ( 3 + 1 )",
    "dimensions they are given in terms of the zeroes of the airy ( gamma ) function .",
    "we emphasize that , even though we probe the low temperature regime , we do not have access to the zero temperature state .",
    "this is because for a given charge of the scalar field , there is a lower bound on the temperature ( for scaling dimensions @xmath2 ) below which the probe approximation breaks down .",
    "thus , even though it is often possible to take a `` zero temperature '' limit of our expressions , the limit itself is _ unphysical_. it is , however , useful for computational purposes , as _ physical _ low - temperature systems are close to it , as we shall show .",

    "we deduce the limit conductivity ( as @xmath138 ) [ eq55 ] ( ) = the real frequencies that solve ( [ eq47 ] ) are the poles of the conductivity . notice that @xmath139 , except at the poles of @xmath140 where @xmath141 diverges as a @xmath1-function .",
    "this expression is unphysical , as we have already explained ( the probe limit breaks down in the limit @xmath77 ) , but it is useful for computational purposes . we shall use it as a starting point to calculate the conductivity of a physical system at low temperatures .    at low temperatures , we can calculate the first - order correction analytically by considering the @xmath77 wave equation ( [ eq44zero ] ) as the zeroth - order equation .",
    "then for the first - order correction @xmath142 to the potential at low temperatures , we obtain from ( [ eq44 ] ) , [ eq44f ] -  + [ z-^2 ] = - _ 1 where _ 1 = z + 3b^3 z ( 2f_1(z ) + z^3 ) - ( 1 + 2z+3z^2)i+ ^2 the first - order potential leads to quasinormal modes which are zeroes of @xmath143 .",
    "thus the real frequencies ( [ eq47 ] ) of the ( unphysical ) @xmath77 limit get shifted at low temperatures away from the real axis .",
    "we obtain @xmath144 , where [ eqdo ] = _ 0 ^ 1 ( bz - ^2 ) _ 1 ( bz-^2 ) this first - order expression is valid for low frequencies .",
    "as we heat up the system , most modes disappear and we are left with a finite number of quasinormal modes .",
    "their number decreases as we increase the temperature .",
    "conversely , as we cool down the system , ( [ eqdo ] ) becomes increasingly accurate for an increasing number of modes .",
    "these modes shift toward the real axis ( @xmath145 ) as we lower the temperature . in the low temperature regime ,",
    "the large @xmath3 is , the more spikes one obtains for @xmath146 .",
    "this shifting of quasinormal modes can be seen in plots of the conductivity . as the mode frequency approaches the real axis ,",
    "the corresponding spike in the plot of the imaginary part of the conductivity becomes more pronounced . to demonstrate this , we calculated the conductivity using the first - order approximation ( [ eq12f ] ) to the scalar field . in figure [ fig01 ]",
    ", we show the imaginary part of the conductivity at temperature @xmath147 and compare with the exact numerical solution .",
    "the agreement is very good even at such high temperature at which only one quasinormal mode is left .",
    "unfortunately , this is the low temperature limit attained by numerical analysis as numerical instabilities prohibit one from lowering the temperature further .",
    "using our analytic results , we see in figure [ figsigintermediate ] the emergence of an increasing number of poles as we lower the temperature to @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "finally in figure [ figsigavsap ] we compare the lower temperature ( @xmath150 ) result with the @xmath77 limit analytic expression ( [ eq55 ] ) , thus demonstrating convergence .     using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for the scalar field ( dotted line ) compared with the exact numerical solution ( solid line ) at @xmath151     using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for @xmath36 at @xmath152 ( left ) , @xmath149 ( right ) .",
    "as the temperature decreases , poles move toward the real axis.,title=\"fig : \" ]   using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for @xmath36 at @xmath152 ( left ) , @xmath149 ( right ) . as the temperature decreases ,",
    "poles move toward the real axis.,title=\"fig : \" ]     using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for f at @xmath153 ( dotted line ) and the @xmath77 limit ( [ eq55 ] ) ( solid line ) . ]    for @xmath154 , the potential is v = b^2 z^2 - 2 ( 1-z^3 ) f(bz ) with @xmath36 given approximately by ( [ eqfd ] ) .",
    "it attains a maximum of order @xmath155 for @xmath156 .",
    "therefore , at zero temperature it has infinite height .",
    "however , the width becomes infinitely narrow leading to a finite tower of poles for the conductivity ( quasinormal modes ) .",
    "in the zero temperature limit , the number of modes increases as one approaches the bf bound and decreases away from it . for @xmath157 ,",
    "the height of the potential becomes finite at zero temperature .",
    "it turns out that the potential is too narrow to possess bound states , so no poles exist for @xmath157 .",
    "the @xmath52 case is similar .",
    "working as in the @xmath51 case , in the ( unphysical ) @xmath77 limit , the wave equation for @xmath158 ( at the bf bound ) in the probe limit reduces to a  - a - [ b^4 z^2 - ^2 ] a = 0 whose acceptable solution can be written in terms of a whittaker function , a = w _ , ( b^2z^2 ) ( the other solution diverges as @xmath135 . ) at the boundary ( @xmath20 ) , it has a logarithmic divergence which we need to subtract before we can calculate qnms and the conductivity @xcite . the conductivity is then given by ( ) = + where a ( z ) = a_0 + a_2 b^2z^2 - a_0 b^2z^2(b^2z^2 ) +  with an arbitrarily chosen cutoff .",
    "using the expansion for small arguments , w _ , ( b^2z^2 ) = - \\ { 1 - } +  we deduce the limit conductivity as @xmath159 , [ eq55d4 ] ( ) = + iwe have a pole at @xmath160 , as expected and an infinite tower of real poles determined by the poles of the digamma function .",
    "the poles have real frequencies [ eqc2 ] = = 2  ,  n=0,1,2 ,      using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for the scalar field ( dotted line ) compared with the exact numerical solution ( solid line ) at @xmath161    these poles are unphysical , but are good approximations to the quasinormal modes at low temperatures , in the physical regime .",
    "as we increase the temperature , these modes move away from the real axis . at any given temperature",
    "we have a finite number of such modes .",
    "as we lower the temperature , their number increases and the quasinormal modes approach the poles on the real axis . to demonstrate this ,",
    "we have calculated the conductivity using the first - order approximation ( [ eq12f ] ) to the scalar field . in figure [ fig01d4 ]",
    "we compare with numerical results at temperature @xmath162 and find good agreement .",
    "as we go to lower temperature , numerical instabilities arise and it is no longer possible to compare our analytic results with their numerical counterparts .",
    "we find convergence to the @xmath77 limit ( [ eq55d4 ] ) , but much slower than in @xmath51 . in figure [ figsigintermediated4 ]",
    "we show the imaginary part of the conductivity at @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "as we lower the temperature , the number of poles increases and the poles shift to the right on the real axis approaching the limit values ( [ eqc2 ] ) which correspond to the @xmath77 limit of the conductivity shown in figure [ figsigavsapd4 ] .     using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for @xmath36 at @xmath165 ( left ) , @xmath149 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   using the expression ( [ eq12f ] ) for @xmath36 at @xmath165 ( left ) , @xmath149 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]     in @xmath52 ( [ eq55d4 ] ) . ]",
    "we discussed holographic superconductors in the probe limit when the scalar hair of the dual black hole is near the bf bound . using the analytic tools",
    "developed in @xcite , we analyzed the low temperature regime trying to go beyond the range of applicability of numerical techniques which fail at very low temperatures .",
    "thus undeterred by numerical instabilities , we found that at low temperatures the condensate diverges as @xmath0 where @xmath1 depends on the dimension of spacetime ( eq .  ( [ eqc1 ] ) ) .",
    "this signals the breakdown of the probe limit at low temperatures even at the bf bound .",
    "the divergence is very mild which explains why it was missed in earlier numerical analyses .",
    "even though the probe limit at zero temperature can not be a physical state for scaling dimensions @xmath2 , it is still useful to analyze it , because it is a good approximation to physical states at low temperatures and thus a good starting point for computational purposes .",
    "we calculated the low temperature conductivity at the bf found in the probe limit and found exact limit analytic expressions in @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we showed that as we lower the temperature , the conductivity has an increasing number of spikes ( quasinormal modes ) which approach the infinite tower of real poles determined by the zeroes of the airy function in @xmath51 ( eq .  ( [ eq47 ] ) ) and the gamma function in @xmath52 ( eq .  ( [ eqc2 ] ) ) .",
    "as we heat up the system , the number of spikes decreases and their positions move off of the real axis .",
    "the probe limit we studied here can be used as a zeroth - order contribution to a perturbative expansion in @xmath115 .",
    "our results can be extended in a systematic way to include back reaction to the bulk metric in order to analyze physical states .",
    "this will greatly facilitate the probe of the zero temperature limit and shed light on the ground state of the system , as numerical methods fail due to numerical instabilities .",
