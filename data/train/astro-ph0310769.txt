    "complex  c is an extensive high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) covering 1700 square degrees in the northern galactic sky and falling at an average lsr velocity of @xmath9 km  s@xmath0  onto the milky way . because of its low metallicity ( @xmath10 solar ) , complex  c is suspected of comprising either intergalactic gas or material tidally stripped from a nearby galaxy , with perhaps some contribution from upwelling galactic outflow .",
    "hvcs are defined as clouds whose observed radial velocities deviate significantly with those expected from galactic rotation , corresponding in practice to clouds with @xmath11 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "they have traditionally been studied in neutral hydrogen 21 cm emission , and more recently with both h@xmath12  emission measurements and absorption line studies .    until 1995",
    ", all the absorption detected in hvcs had been in lines of neutral or low ionization species .",
    "highly ionized gas was then discovered with the detections of high - velocity  in the spectra of mrk  509 and pks  2155304 @xcite . following the launch of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) satellite in the summer of 1999 ,  has been repeatedly detected in absorption in hvcs ; the first high - velocity  results were reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , a survey of high - velocity  has been completed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s03 ) .",
    "since  is an ion that exists at temperatures of a few@xmath13 k @xcite , its presence in hvcs poses a variety of intriguing questions : primarily , what physical process produces the ?",
    "does the ion originate at some form of interface between the neutral and warm ionized components of hvcs and a surrounding hot medium",
    "? can photoionization by the hard extragalactic radiation field play an important role ?",
    "s03 began to address these issues with a study of 102 sight lines , 58 of which displayed high - velocity  absorption .",
    "in this project we focus our attention on five extragalactic sight lines ( mrk  279 , mrk  817 , mrk  876 , pg  1259 + 593 , and pg  1351 + 640 ) passing through hvc complex  c , in order to determine the inter - relationships between the various phases of gas present in hvcs .",
    "our approach is to compare the kinematics and column densities of high and low ion absorption in high - velocity gas .",
    "clues concerning the physical conditions within the absorbing material are provided by observing the extent and structure of the absorption profiles in different species .    in figure 1",
    "we show a color map of complex  c from the dwingeloo hvc survey @xcite , displaying the velocity structure within the complex .",
    "gas covering a range in velocities of @xmath14 km  s@xmath0  is present in complex c. the observed range in column densities and velocities indicates a complex system with a large amount of sub - structure .",
    "the sight lines studied in this paper are marked with stars .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in  2 we give a brief summary of previous studies of complex  c. section 3 contains a description of our observations and data reduction .",
    "we present spectroscopic measurements of high - velocity , highly ionized absorption in  4 . in  5 we display our spectra and compare the high and low ion absorption along five complex  c sight lines . in ",
    "6 we discuss and review various models that might explain the existence of highly ionized gas in hvcs . in  7",
    "we discuss the influence of non - solar abundance patterns on the model predictions .",
    "the theories are compared with our observations in  8 , using ionic ratios and kinematic information .",
    "we mention interesting results from sight lines passing near to complex  c in  9 .",
    "our results are summarized in  10 .",
    "detailed abundances studies of complex  c have been carried out by a number of authors @xcite , who have all used _ hst _  and _ fuse _  spectroscopy to determine column densities of various ionic species through the complex , and combined them with  21 cm emission measurements to derive elemental abundances .",
    "these studies have found values of ( / ) between 0.09 and 0.25 times solar , and no evidence for depletion onto dust .",
    "precise measurements are difficult because of a number of sources of error , particularly uncertain ionization corrections , the difficulty of measuring a precise @xmath15 value , and the fact that  radio emission measurements sample a beam far larger than that probed in absorption measurements .",
    "relative elemental abundance ratios are important in understanding the history of complex  c. @xcite find that in the magellanic clouds log(n / o)@xmath16 and log(n / o)@xmath17 , and @xcite found that log(n / o ) typically lies between @xmath18 and @xmath19 in dwarf galaxies with log@xmath20 . an observed value in complex  c is",
    "log(n / o)@xmath21 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* towards pg  1259 + 593 ) , in line with these measurements in other locations .",
    "a conclusive direct distance determination would be an invaluable piece of information in studying complex  c ; unfortunately , such a determination is difficult to make . the strongest constraint that exists is a lower limit of 6.1kpc @xcite , based upon the non - detection of in absorption towards stars at known distances lying in this part of the sky .",
    "note , however , that this non - detection is not strongly significant ( as defined by * ? ? ?",
    "a more reliable lower limit to the distance is 1.3kpc .",
    "it has been suggested that hvcs may represent material taking part in a galactic fountain @xcite .",
    "however , the low metallicities observed make this scenario unlikely for complex  c , since fountain gas , having been blown out of the disk by type ii supernovae , should have solar or super - solar rather than sub - solar abundances , and a solar n / o ratio of log(n / o)@xmath22 . substantial dilution by primordial gas would be necessary to bring fountain gas down to the observed level of metallicity .",
    "we note that the approximately solar abundances measured in intermediate velocity clouds ( ivcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest they are formed by galactic material ; it is the ivcs that are consequently thought to be tracing the fountain circulation .",
    "the _ fuse _  satellite @xcite operates in the far - ultraviolet wavelength regime between 905 and 1187 , providing medium resolution ( @xmath23 , corresponding to @xmath24 km  s@xmath0  fwhm ) spectra with enough sensitivity that faint extragalactic sources can be observed .",
    "the _ fuse _  data analyzed in this paper were obtained from the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) .    in order to investigate the highly ionized gas in complex  c",
    ", we took all the sight lines through complex  c observed with the _ fuse _  satellite and applied a set of selection criteria to identify those directions containing useful high ion information .",
    "these criteria took the form of a series of constraints , that eventually left us with our sample .",
    "to be classified as going through complex  c , we required that a sight line had to lie within the @xmath25@xmath26  contour of @xmath3 ( ) in the @xcite dwingeloo hvc survey .",
    "constraint 1 eliminated sight lines with poor signal - to - noise , i.e. s / n@xmath27 near 1030  in the 10-pixel - rebinned _ fuse _  spectrum . constraint 2 looked for sight lines with good  data , and rejected those with blending or continuum placement problems .",
    "finally , constraint 3 looked for sight lines that have been observed with either the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) or the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on _ hst _ , at better than 30 km  s@xmath0  resolution .",
    "those that were not were eliminated .",
    "the reason for constraint 3 is that with _",
    "_  data we can form ionic ratios with , or at least upper limits , to investigate the ionization mechanism . such an approach can not be achieved with _ fuse _",
    "data alone . applying these conditions generated our sample of five sight lines , namely mrk  279 , mrk  817 , mrk  876 , pg  1259 + 593 , and pg  1351 + 640 , each of which have good _ fuse _  and _ hst _  data .",
    "of our chosen five sight lines , two ( mrk  279 and mrk  817 ) have ghrs spectra of the region near 1240 , where the  doublet lies , and three ( mrk  876 , pg  1259 + 593  and pg  1351 + 640 ) have stis spectra covering this region . in the case of pg  1259 + 593",
    ", we were also able to use stis data of , , and various low - ionization species .",
    "consequently , this remains the sight line for which we have the best quality data available , and the strongest insight into ionization processes .",
    "a summary of basic target data is given in table 1 , where for each sight line we include galactic longitude @xmath28 , galactic latitude @xmath15 , redshift of source @xmath29 , type of source , apparent @xmath30 magnitude of source , galactic foreground interstellar reddening @xmath31 , high - velocity neutral hydrogen column density @xmath3 ( ) , heliocentric to lsr velocity correction @xmath32 , and recent measurements of [ o / h ] and [ n / h ] in complex  c by @xcite .",
    "in the following two subsections we describe our data handling procedures for our two separate datasets .",
    "details of our _ fuse _",
    "observations are given in table 2 .",
    "the data were reduced using the data reduction pipeline calfuse v2.1.6 , except for mrk  279 , for which we used v2.0.5 .",
    "this anomaly was because of compatibility problems between early _ fuse _   datasets ( such as the mrk  279 observations ) and the newer versions of the calfuse pipeline .",
    "the difference in velocity calibration caused by this inconsistency is expected to be minimal , since all calfuse versions after 2.0 have greatly improved velocity scale accuracy over earlier ones .    despite the improvements made in the calibration software , we still found it necessary to apply velocity shifts to each spectrum to register the velocity scale correctly .",
    "our approach was to tie the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 absorption lines to the centers of emission observed in , using effelsberg 100 m radio telescope 21 cm observations .",
    "this process transforms the velocity scale into the local standard of rest ( lsr ) frame .",
    "after using gaussian component fitting software to measure the velocity centroids of components in neutral gas absorption lines , we determined the velocity correction necessary to align these components with the corresponding components seen in .",
    "where possible , we tied the scale to the high - velocity components of , since these velocities were often cleaner and more distinct , and hence easier to measure .",
    "the actual lines used for alignment in each case depended on the individual spectrum .",
    "we checked for velocity scale differences between different channels and different exposures within the same channel .",
    "the shifts we applied were all in the range 10 to 50 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the effelsberg 100 m radio telescope has a beam size of @xmath37 , and a velocity resolution of @xmath38 km  s@xmath0 ; the  observations we used are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "our alignment procedure has the advantage that  spectra are extremely reliable in their velocity calibration , since radio frequencies can be measured with very high precision .",
    "additionally , when observing an  spectrum towards an extragalactic source , one has the advantage of knowing that the source is beyond the emitting gas , so absorption lines and emission lines can be reliably compared .",
    "thus the only potential source of errors in our alignment process are the assumptions that the neutral ions trace the , and that emission measurements extending over the radio telescope beam of ten arcminutes can be safely compared to absorption measurements sampled over an effectively infinitesimally small beam equal to the angular size of the agn . in light of these concerns , we estimate an error of 5 km  s@xmath0  in our _ fuse _  velocities after alignment . a detailed discussion of velocity calibration issues in _ fuse _  spectra , and how to deal with them , is given in @xcite .",
    "since each pixel on the _ fuse _  detectors has a velocity width of @xmath39 km  s@xmath0 , but the instrumental resolution is only @xmath24 km  s@xmath0  ( fwhm ) , the data from the instrument are highly oversampled , and so we have rebinned each spectrum by five pixels ( i.e. to @xmath40 km  s@xmath0  bins ) to obtain the versions displayed and measured in this paper .",
    "we fit continua to our spectra using low order ( @xmath41 ) legendre polynomials over @xmath42  regions on either side of each line under study .",
    "the primary focus of our investigation is  @xmath43 , since the presence of transition - temperature gas in high - velocity clouds has only recently been discovered .",
    "absorption from @xmath44 is responsible for blending with high - velocity ( complex  c ) absorption from the weak  line , at 1037.627 ; we therefore do not include measurements of the weak line in this work .",
    "we also study @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the line is very strong , and although this typically leads to saturation in the line center , the high sensitivity in the wings helps to reveal the full extent of the neutral gas absorption ; the  21 cm line is not sensitive to these lower column density regions .",
    "unfortunately , we could make no clean observation of @xmath45 , a tracer of intermediate - ionization gas , at complex  c velocities , because the line is blended below @xmath46 km  s@xmath0  by zero velocity absorption from @xmath47 .",
    "the same blending problem afflicts high - velocity absorption by @xmath48 , this time by @xmath49 .",
    "although or are stronger and hence more preferable tracers of intermediate - ionization gas , we do include profiles of @xmath50 , to trace the kinematics of this phase of interstellar gas .    the strength of contamination from molecular hydrogen varied between our five sight lines .",
    "the h@xmath51 ( 60 ) p(3 ) line at 1031.191  is the offending line , since in the rest frame of @xmath43 it has a velocity of @xmath52 km  s@xmath0 , near the negative velocity limit of complex  c. for mrk  876 , where the h@xmath51 column density is the highest , we corrected the  profile for contamination from h@xmath51 by measuring the other h@xmath51 lines in the vicinity of the  line .",
    "our model of the h@xmath51 ( 60 ) p(3 ) line included two components ( 1 : @xmath53 km  s@xmath0 , depth = 0.60 , fwhm = 31 km  s@xmath0 ; 2 : @xmath54 km  s@xmath0 , depth = 0.30 , fwhm = 19 km  s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the effect of this process is to reduce the measured high - velocity  column density slightly . to account for the errors this process introduces",
    ", our systematic error on the  column density towards mrk  876 includes the effect of varying the model parameters : @xmath55(h@xmath51 ) by @xmath56 km  s@xmath0 , the h@xmath51 depth by @xmath56% , and the h@xmath51 width by @xmath56% . towards",
    "pg  1351 + 640 , the sight line with the second highest molecular hydrogen column density , the complex  c  absorption does not extend to @xmath57 km  s@xmath0 , so there is no h@xmath51 interference .",
    "the ghrs and stis spectra we use are described in table 3 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for descriptions of the on - orbit performance of the ghrs and stis instruments , respectively .",
    "all data were all taken with intermediate resolution gratings , and were reduced using standard processing pipelines .",
    "the grating used and its resolution , found in the ghrs @xcite and stis @xcite instrument handbooks , are listed for each exposure in columns three and eight .    in order to achieve consistency in comparing _ fuse _  and",
    "_ hst _  spectra , we chose to display all absorption line spectra in 10 km  s@xmath0  bins . given that the pixel size between ghrs and stis exposures varies ( column nine ) , our wish for 10 km  s@xmath0  rebinned pixels implied a different rebinning factor for the different _ hst _  spectra , and this factor is given in column ten of table 3 .    the velocities were converted from the heliocentric to the lsr reference frame using the corrections listed in table 1 .",
    "the velocity calibration from the _ hst _  detector pipelines is far more reliable than from the _ fuse _  pipelines , so no further alignment was considered necessary .",
    "any residual errors introduced by inaccuracies in the ghrs and stis wavelength scales are unlikely to change the conclusions of this paper , since the kinematic inter - relationships we focus on are mainly between absorption lines in the _ fuse _  dataset .",
    "we used @xmath40  regions on either side of @xmath58 for continuum fitting , in the same manner as was used for the _ fuse _  data (  3.1 ) . in the case of pg  1259 + 593",
    ", the same procedure was used for  @xmath59 ,  @xmath60 , and various low and intermediate ionization lines .",
    "all our targets are extragalactic sources , which tend ( unlike stellar spectra ) to have flat continua , so the continuum placement process was generally straightforward .",
    "our measurements of high - velocity , highly ionized absorption are presented in table 4 . for each high ionization absorption line detected at complex  c velocities",
    ", we list the rest vacuum wavelength ( @xmath61 ) , velocity range of high - velocity absorption ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , velocity centroid and width of high - velocity absorption ( @xmath64 and @xmath15 ) , obtained through either the moments of the apparent optical depth profile or through gaussian component fitting , equivalent width ( @xmath65 ) , column density ( @xmath3 ) and signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element ( s / n ) in the vicinity of the line .",
    "all velocities in this table , and throughout this paper , are quoted in the lsr reference frame , and all column densities quoted are measured in the high - velocity gas , not integrated over the full extent of the absorption . is not usually recognised as a high ion , but we include measurements of high - velocity absorption here to assess the relationship between absorption in intermediate and highly ionized gas .",
    "the velocity ranges we used for the complex  c absorption were chosen after careful consideration of the extent of the high - velocity absorption in different species along each sight line . in some cases",
    "these are different ( by up to 20 km  s@xmath0 ) from the velocity ranges used in s03 , due to the addition of newer , higher s / n data and improvements in the pipeline processing .",
    "our table makes use of two methods for finding the central velocity and width of highly ionized absorption .",
    "when possible , we fit gaussian components to the data , and present the formal central velocity ( @xmath64 ) and width ( @xmath15 ) of the gaussian .",
    "this is only possible when the high - velocity component is distinct and free from blending with other lines .",
    "the other method makes use of the moments of the apparent optical depth , found from the continuum - normalized flux profile @xmath66 by @xmath67 the first moment gives the velocity centroid @xmath68 the second moment yields the doppler width @xmath69 when the gaussian fit method is available , we use this as the preferable indicator of velocity centroid , since the moment method gives a skewed result when the absorption is highly asymmetric about the line center . with either method , our error on @xmath64 accounts for both statistical errors and uncertainty in the velocity zero point ( 5 km  s@xmath0  for _ fuse _  spectra , and 2 km  s@xmath0  for _ hst _  data ) . the error on @xmath15 accounts only for statistical errors , since the line width is insensitive to the zero point of the velocity scale .",
    "the column densities were calculated using the apparent optical depth ( aod ) technique @xcite ; first @xmath70 is converted to @xmath71 using @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the oscillator strength and @xmath61 the wavelength of the transition ( expressed in   when using the second form , to give @xmath71 in @xmath26(kms@xmath0)@xmath0 ) .",
    "equation ( 4 ) is then integrated to find the total column density between two velocity limits :    @xmath74    for sight lines in which we detect no high - velocity or absorption , we present 3@xmath7 upper limits for the column density , unless blending prevents such a measurement being made .",
    "there are two errors quoted for each measurement of equivalent width and column density .",
    "the first is a statistical error , found from a quadrature sum of uncertainties in the count rate ( poisson noise ) and continuum placement uncertainty .",
    "the second error is a conservative estimation of systematic error , found from a quadrature addition of fixed pattern noise in the detectors , and choice of velocity integration limits .",
    "we estimated fixed pattern errors per pixel of 10% for _ fuse _ , 2% for ghrs , and 1% for stis detectors , and an uncertainty in the velocity limits of 15 km  s@xmath0  for _ fuse _  spectra , and 6 km  s@xmath0  for both ghrs and stis spectra .",
    "note that this velocity error itself has two components : one due to the intrinsic uncertainty in the post - calibration velocity scale , and one due to the uncertainty over which velocities should be used to define high - velocity absorption .",
    "it is the velocity range uncertainty which dominates our systematic error in most cases , since the high - velocity absorption is not always distinct from low - velocity absorption , and sometimes the chosen division is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element is calculated by measuring of the rms dispersion of the data around the fitted continuum , in the proximity of each line . in every case",
    "our independently measured   column density is statistically identical ( within the 1@xmath7 error ) to the one previously published in s03 .",
    "figures 2 , 3 , and 4 display stacks of absorption line and  21 cm emission line profiles for mrk  279 and mrk  817 , mrk  876 and pg  1351 + 640 , and pg  1259 + 593   respectively . dashed vertical lines correspond to the peaks in the neutral hydrogen emission line profile given in the top panel , and show the velocities at which the neutral gas column density is highest .",
    "dotted lines illustrate our continuum placement , chosen using the technique described in  3 .",
    "absorption in the velocity range corresponding to complex  c absorption is shaded in gray , according to the limits quoted in table 4  we note that the width of the complex  c absorption components may vary between species , hence the shading is included principally for illustrative purposes .",
    "short vertical tick marks indicate the location of absorption blends . for galactic blends ,",
    "the tick marks designate the velocity where we expect the component to appear , assuming the absorbing ion occurs at the same velocity as the neutral hydrogen . in the cases of mrk  876 and pg  1351 + 640 , many of the blends have a two - component structure , which is marked accordingly . for extragalactic blends , where the absorption blend occurs at higher redshift ,",
    "the tick marks simply designate the line center of the blend .",
    "the  profile towards mrk  279 shows eight components between @xmath75 and 50 km  s@xmath0 , including two complex  c features at @xmath76 and @xmath77 km  s@xmath0  ( left panel of figure 2 )",
    ". there appears to be corresponding absorption centered near @xmath76 km  s@xmath0  in the , ,  and  profiles .",
    "the detection of high - velocity  absorption , although tentative , is particularly interesting , and was first reported in @xcite .",
    "this feature is centered at @xmath78 km  s@xmath0 , and we measure its equivalent width as @xmath79m , between the velocity limits of @xmath80 and @xmath81 km  s@xmath0 , corresponding to log@xmath3()@xmath82 . since the systematic errors change the equivalent width but not the presence of the feature ( i.e. , it could be @xmath83 or @xmath84m ) , the formal significance of the high - velocity  detection is @xmath85 .",
    "this absorption extends down to @xmath80 km  s@xmath0 , not to @xmath86 km  s@xmath0  as do the other ions shown in figure 2 .",
    "the large number of neutral hydrogen components present in this direction makes the separation of low and high - velocity gas difficult .",
    "however , it is striking how the high - velocity absorption traces the shape of the absorption closely ; on the negative side of the high - velocity absorption , both ions recover to the continuum just beyond @xmath86 km  s@xmath0 , and on the positive side they both start to recover at @xmath81 km  s@xmath0 . though the line is heavily saturated , damping wings would not appear unless @xmath3 ( )  @xmath87@xmath26 , so the observed wings are likely kinematic , not lorentzian . with our chosen velocity limits , we measure @xmath65()@xmath88m , corresponding to log@xmath3()@xmath89 .",

    "nonetheless , this is a first attempt at quantifying the effects of low metallicities on high ion production .",
    "equation 10 has to be applied twice in order to apply the model ionic ratio predictions to the complex  c gas ; these two corrections are described in the next two subsections .",

    "the absence of h@xmath51 in complex  c @xcite is consistent with the absence of dust since h@xmath51 is thought to form on the surface of dust grains .",
    "finally , note that ( with the exception of carbon ) we have used measured abundance ratios of the _ neutral _ gas in complex  c ; if this hvc is interacting with a surrounding medium , then this medium could also display non - solar abundance patterns . in any model",

    "uncertainties of @xmath222dex are likely because of incomplete knowledge of the elemental abundances ; perhaps a similar error arises from the assumption that the cooling is dominated by oxygen . from these two plots",
    "we conclude that tmls or cis could be potential explanations for the highly ionized material around complex  c. we have outlined these two model boxes in blue in figures 6 and 7 to highlight their position .    examining the ci model further",

    "the data are most consistent with _ young _ ( @xmath225yr ) interfaces , since the adjusted - abundance ci boxes in figures 6 and 7 overlap the data at their high @xmath3(x)/@xmath3 ( ) extents , which correspond to lower interface age .",
    "physically this is because the columns do not reach their maximum values until @xmath226yr , but the other high ions peak in abundance at earlier interface age .",
    "the theory predicts @xmath3 ( )  @xmath227@xmath26  per interface ( depending on the magnetic field direction ) , which we can correct by a factor of 0.8 to account for non - solar abundances . even if we assume a magnetic field normal to the cloud boundary , we would still require between six to eighteen interfaces ( i.e. , three to nine clouds ) , to account for the observed  column densities in complex  c of @xmath228 , with a larger number if the magnetic field has a component parallel to the boundary , quenching the conduction .",
    "in one particular case , we already know of a multiple component structure : two high - velocity neutral components are thought to exist toward pg  1259 + 593  @xcite , providing four interfaces .",
    "therefore , at least one more low density neutral absorber at complex  c velocities , with a pair of hot interfaces , is necessary to explain the  toward pg  1259 + 593  in the ci model .",
    "such a component could be too close in velocity to the @xmath229 km  s@xmath0  component to be resolved with current instruments .",
    "the @xmath3 ( ) prediction may be the least robust of the various models , since  has the lowest creation ionization potential ( 33.5ev ) of any of the high ions under study , and so is most susceptible to production by photoionization , for example by photons escaping the galactic disk .",
    "this might lead to enhanced @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( ) ratios over the individual model predictions , raising all boxes vertically upward toward the pg  1259 + 593  data point on figure 7 .",
    "photoionization could also enhance the @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( ) ratio , if the radiation field were hard enough . on the other hand , depending on the slope of the ionizing spectrum , the @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( ) ratio could",
    "also _ decrease _ if enough is formed to depress the  prediction . a more detailed understanding of the escaping radiation filed is needed to fully investigate the effect of additional photoionization .",
    "if it does play a role , then multiple ionization processes are occuring in hvcs , just as multiple ionization processes appear to be at work in the hot galactic halo @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , given the paucity of data points and the uncertainty in the model predictions stemming from the numerous metallicity issues , we can not at this point uniquely specify the ionization mechanism purely from the ionic ratios .",
    "analysis of ionic ratios has the further problem that multiple , separate regions of absorbing gas , closely related in velocity space , can contribute to the integrated column density along a line of sight , making interpretation of ionic ratios very difficult .",
    "however , the _ kinematics _ of the absorption provide further information ; by comparing the extent and line centers of high - velocity absorption between species , one can gain useful information regarding the ionization mechanism .    in the case of mrk  279 and",
    "mrk  817 , high - velocity absorption is detected in low and high ionization species at very similar velocities ( mrk  279 : @xmath230 km  s@xmath0 , @xmath231 km  s@xmath0 ; mrk  817 : @xmath232 km  s@xmath0 , @xmath233 km  s@xmath0 ) . in the other three sight lines",
    "the difference is less than 20 km  s@xmath0 . in table 8",
    "we list our measured central velocities of the high - velocity , and compare them to both the centers of the and components , and to earlier measures of the  velocities from s03 . in our sample",
    "the average displacement @xmath1 km  s@xmath0 , where the error represents the standard deviation of the sample , whereas the s03 results ( that used nine complex  c sight lines ) have an average displacement @xmath234 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the differences between our measurements and the s03 measurements of @xmath235 are due to different data reduction pipelines ( v2.1.6 versus v1.8.7 ) , and in the case of pg  1351 + 640 , our inclusion of new data .",
    "these changes caused the choice of velocity integration limits to change ( when @xmath55 is measured using the moment of the optical depth technique ) , or by our using the component fitting method when the line center was more clearly defined .",
    "we also measure @xmath2 km  s@xmath0 . these small differences between the velocities of , , and reveal a strong kinematic connection between the neutral and highly ionized gas in complex  c.    the observed velocity alignments are consistent with , and indeed suggestive of , an origin at some form of interface between cold / warm and hot regions of gas .",
    "there is no reason why the ion  should line up with  otherwise , since these two species trace different interstellar phases and do not exist in the same physical regions , unless the  is frozen - in at a far lower temperature than that at which it normally appears .",
    "we stress that the observed alignment between  and neutral species is not an artifact of the velocity calibration procedure , which relied upon tying the neutral species ( but not the ) in the _ fuse_bandpass with  emission components .    in an interface scenario , any neutral cloud , _ regardless of its depth _ , contributes two interfaces to the line of sight .",
    "thus one would not expect to see a good correlation between @xmath3 ( ) and @xmath3 ( ) along lines of sight sampling hot and cold regions of gas separated by interfaces .",
    "indeed , @xcite found no such correlation when studying the  distribution along 102 sight lines through the galactic halo .",
    "the ability of interface geometries to explain kinematic correspondences between low- and high - ionization absorbing species has been recognised before @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite concluded that interfaces along the line of sight toward globular cluster star vz  1128 are a plausible explanation for the similar kinematics observed in low- and high - ionization species in that direction .    toward pg  1259 + 593",
    ", a displacement of @xmath130 km  s@xmath0  is observed between the high - velocity  and  centroids .",
    "however , it is already suspected that there are two high - velocity neutral gas components along this sight line , with the @xmath229 km  s@xmath0  component containing enough neutral gas to be seen in  emission , and the @xmath236 km  s@xmath0component not detected in  emission , but seen in the more sensitive absorption line @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if we assume the high - velocity  toward pg  1259 + 593  to be predominantly associated with the @xmath236 km  s@xmath0  neutral gas component , so that @xmath237 km  s@xmath0 , then the average displacement between neutral and highly ionized complex  c gas becomes @xmath238 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "such a scenario , with two components having very different @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( ) ratios , can easily be explained in the interface picture by two neutral clouds of different column density , each with its own pair of interfaces .",
    "therefore the type of displacement seen toward pg  1259 + 593  is not inconsistent with the interface theory , but rather can be explained by multiple interfaces .",
    "table 9 contains a detailed study of all the absorption species toward pg  1259 + 593  for which we could measure a precise line center to the complex  c gas , using gaussian component fitting .",
    "each of the species appears to be centered either near @xmath229 km  s@xmath0  ( designated component 1 ) , or near @xmath236 km  s@xmath0(component 2 ) . component 2 has a overall higher degree of ionization , being seen in  and .",
    "though assigning a component to each absorption line is difficult on the basis of these velocities alone , the stucture seen in figure 4 and the fact that these components have been reported elsewhere lend support to our conclusion that multiple components exist toward pg  1259 + 593 .",
    "the conductive interface ( ci ,  6.4 ) and the turbulent mixing layer models ( tml ,  6.5 ) both have the attractive feature of naturally explaining the closely aligned kinematics observed between low and high ionization species .",
    "recent studies have shown that turbulent magnetic fields do not completely suppress thermal conduction across interfaces @xcite , so the true nature of the ionization at hvc surfaces likely includes both turbulent and conduction effects .",
    "regardless of whether the energy is transported by thermal conduction or turbulent mixing , our kinematic observations are consistent with the core - interface structure of hvcs suggested by @xcite , and discussed in @xcite .",
    "complex  c is known to have an  component at velocities @xmath239 km  s@xmath0 , along a ridge passing spatially along the middle of the main cloud @xcite .",
    "this feature can be seen in figure 1 , and was dubbed the `` high - velocity ridge '' ( hvr ) by @xcite .",
    "these authors found similar morphologies and low - ion column density ratios in the hvr and complex  c proper , suggesting similar abundances and physical conditions in the two parts of the complex .",
    "of the five sight lines we study in detail here , mrk  876 and pg  1351 + 640  pass through the hvr , with mrk  279 just adjacent to the @xmath3 ( )  @xmath240@xmath26  contour , whereas mrk  817 and pg  1259 + 593  clearly contain no hvr  emission .",
    "interestingly , as seen in table 4 , mrk  817 and pg  1259 + 593  are the same two sight lines whose velocity limits of  absorption only extend to @xmath97 km  s@xmath0 .",
    "in other words , those sight lines that display hvr  emission also display hvr absorption . this is further evidence of a kinematic correspondence between the low and high ionization species .",
    "analysis of the widths of the high - velocity components can give information on the temperature in the absorbing gas .",
    "fully interpreting line widths is difficult because of line blending , the presence of multiple components , instrumental broadening , and non - thermal broadening .",
    "however , we find that our observed high - velocity  line widths lie in the range @xmath241 km  s@xmath0  ( not accounting for instrumental broadening , which for _ fuse _  is of order @xmath242 km  s@xmath0 ) . a purely",
    "thermally broadened  absorber at 300,000k would have @xmath243 km  s@xmath0 , suggesting that some non - thermal process is contributing to the line widths .",
    "however , it is also possible that these detections are multiple thermally - broadened components blended together , especially toward pg  1259 + 593  where we already know of two high - velocity components .",
    "one explicit prediction of the conductive interface theory is that the  lines should be predominantly thermally broadened  unfortunately , there are too many unknowns to fully test this prediction , but our data are not inconsistent with it .",
    "s03 noticed a trend in which the value of @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( ) in complex c increases toward lower longitudes and latitudes .",
    "@xcite interpreted this as evidence supporting their claim that the lower latitude and lower longitude parts of the complex are interacting more vigorously with the surrounding medium , forming a `` leading edge '' of the complex .",
    "this claim is based on their detailed study of the physical conditions in the gas towards 3c  351 . with our small sample of five sight lines with new measurements of",
    ", it is difficult to either confirm or refute this claim .",
    "however , we note that the variation in @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( ) is predominantly caused by variation in @xmath3 ( ) , which changes by a factor of @xmath24 over the face of complex  c , whereas @xmath3 ( ) only varies by a factor of @xmath244 . in the conductive interface scenario that we favor ,",
    "this situation could reflect a cloud geometry in which the lower longitude and latitude parts of the cloud have a lower depth of neutral gas , but still have a similar number of interfaces and hence similar @xmath3 ( ) .    by using the  a tracer of a hot shell of material surrounding complex  c",
    ", one can estimate the total amount of mass contained in the hot ionized gas phase of the complex , according to @xmath245    where @xmath166 is the fraction of oxygen atoms in the five - times - ionized state , and @xmath246 is the oxygen abundance in complex  c. using the average observed ratio of @xmath247 in complex  c ( s03 ) and @xmath248 , we find the mass of complex  c in -bearing gas to be approximately 18% of the  mass , or @xmath249% of the total ( + ) hydrogen mass",
    ". this fraction would decrease if a significant amount of is contained within the warm ( @xmath250k ) ionized material , but would increase if @xmath251 .",
    "@xcite has estimated the neutral mass of complex  c to be @xmath252 , so that @xmath253 if the distance to complex  c is 6kpc .    in the interface scenario , the detection of highly ionized gas in hvcs offers further evidence ( albeit indirect ) for the presence of a hot extended corona or local group medium with which complex  c is interacting .",
    "several lines of evidence already exist that indicate a interaction between hvcs and the low density gaseous galactic halo @xcite . these include ( a ) the pattern of decreasing cloud velocities for clouds closer to the galactic plane , expected if drag dominates the cloud infall , ( b ) cometary ( head / tail ) hvcs and evidence of stripping , ( c ) h@xmath12 enhancement on cloud edges , ( d ) x - ray emission possibly associated with complex  c , and ( e ) high non - thermal  pressures .",
    "studies with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray satellites have recently detected both and absorption near zero velocity @xcite .",
    "these ions could be tracing the same extended corona that we believe is interacting with complex  c.",
    "several sight lines passing close to complex  c have been observed with _ fuse _  - we briefly mention the important properties of the most relevant , since it is of interest how highly ionized gas in these directions may relate to complex  c.      @xcite have published absorption line measurements of the sight line toward h1821 + 643 , passing near complex  c. there is a highly ionized absorption component in this direction at @xmath254 km  s@xmath0 , with unusual ionization properties : seen in  and , but not in  emission or absorption . h1821 + 643 is a direction that passes through the outer arm of the milky way , but the high - velocity component is well separated from the outer arm absorption . using the @xcite measurements of , , and  together with the s03 measurement of  we find @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( )  @xmath255 , @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( )  @xmath256 , and @xmath3()/@xmath3 ( )  @xmath257 , similar to what is observed in complex c. however , it is not clear whether this component has any affiliation with complex  c , since the absorption is centered almost 100 km  s@xmath0  away from the highly ionized gas seen in complex  c proper",
    ". furthermore , the h1821 + 643 sight line passes more than @xmath258 from where gas at such velocities is seen in .",

    "the 3@xmath7 limit for high - velocity toward mrk  487 is @xmath3()@xmath266 , unfortunately not a strong constraint .",
    "an  non - detection would represent an important result , since in this case the interface surrounding complex  c would have to be thin enough not to be detected toward mrk  487 .",
