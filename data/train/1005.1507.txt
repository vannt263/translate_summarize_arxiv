    "however , smooth solutions of do not exist in general ( shocks may develop ) , and weak entropy solutions have to be considered , cf .  definition [ def : entropy ] and lemma [ lemmanonloc ] below .",
    "nonlocal equations like appear in different areas of research .",
    "for instance , in mathematical finance , option pricing models based on jump processes ( cf .",

    "equation consists of three different terms : nonlinear convection @xmath11 , nonlinear diffusion @xmath12 , and fractional diffusion @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "it is expected that the effect of a diffusion operator is that solutions become smoother than the prescribed initial data . in our case , however , @xmath13 can be strongly degenerate ( i.e. , vanish on intervals of positive length ) , and hence solutions can exhibit shocks .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the case when @xmath14 , and to @xcite for the case when @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the discontinuous galerkin ( dg hereafter ) method is a well established method for approximating solutions of convection @xcite and convection - diffusion equations @xcite . to obtain a dg approximation of a nonlinear equation , one has to pass to the weak formulation , do integration by parts , and replace the nonlinearities with suitable numerical fluxes ( fluxes which enforce numerical stability and convergence ) .",
