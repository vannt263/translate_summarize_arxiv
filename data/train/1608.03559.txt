    "as an introduction , we report to the work of accioly and mukai @xcite previously published back in 1997 . in their work they claim that the massive fermions of energy @xmath1 do exhibit helicity flip as the particles interact with podolsky s generalized electromagnetic field . their claim is based on and drawn from the three - dimensional diagram plots shown in figures 7 and 8 in the conclusion section of their article . however , those plots clearly show us that _ there is no helicity flip _ since de graph for their @xmath2 ( fermion s polarization ) axis for both diagrams present _ only _ positive values in the range @xmath3 . in order to show",
    "a helicity filp one has to have in the plot , a graph going from positive values to negative values of @xmath2 .    in this work",
    "we revisit their calculation for the polarization considering a charged fermion being scattered by a charged scalar pion in the podolsky s electrodynamics @xcite . to do that , we consider at the tree level the scattering of a charged fermion by a scalar charged pion , initially at rest in the laboratory frame . for a fermion with energy @xmath1",
    "we reproduce their tree - dimensional plot ( see figure [ fig : accioly ] ) .",
    "this plot does not evidence helicity flip for the fermion .",
    "however , as we lower the fermion s energy to @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig : sales ] ) we can clearly see the helicity flip for the fermion , from positive values of @xmath2 going to negative values of @xmath2 ( the bottom right corner of the tree - dimensional graph has values around @xmath4 ) .",
    "we analyse the reaction process @xmath5 where @xmath6 represents the electron traveling with energy @xmath7 towards a pion @xmath8 at rest .",
    "after the scattering , there emerges an electron in a direction that makes an angle @xmath9 relative to the original direction .",
    "this process reveals a change in the polarization of the electron discussed in @xcite , using podolsky s theory @xcite .",
    "first we obtain the relevant podolsky s photon propagator which enter in the calculation of the right - handed and left - handed helicities .",
    "we show that for the electron with @xmath1 , there is no helicity flip ; however , for lower energy electron with @xmath0 , helicity flip does really occur .",
    "the covariant lagrangian density for the theory is given by @xmath10    in the lagrangean density above , we have represented the electron mass by @xmath11 and the pion mass by @xmath12 , electrically charged with charges @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectivelly .",
    "the relevant feynman rules that we need are @xmath15    the propagator for the photon in the podolsky s theory can be calculated from the lagrangean density and is given by @xcite @xmath16 , \\label{propagador}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the momentum of the virtual photon exchanged between the electron and the pion and @xmath18 is the characteristic podolsky s parameter .    without loss of generality",
    ", we may consider the effect of negative helicity of an incident electron in a pion at rest according to the process ( [ espalhamento ] ) @xcite .",
    "the helicity flip for a fermionic particle beam can be calculated by the evaluation of the scattered polarization defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the number of fermions that emerge from the scattering with negative helicity and @xmath21 is the number of scattered fermions with positive helicity .",
    "the polarization as defined by equation ( [ helicity ] ) ranges between @xmath22 .",
    "if there is no positive helicity among the scattered particles , @xmath23 , and consequently @xmath24 and all the scattered fermions have the same helicity as the incident fermions , that is , negative helicity .",
    "we then conclude that there is no helicity flip in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath25 ( that is , all the scattered fermions have now positive helicity , or opposite helicity as compared to the incident ones ) then @xmath26 and we conclude that there is a total helicity flip . evidently ,",
    "between these two extreme situations , we may find helicity flip occuring partially .",
    "the key to determine whether there was or there was not a helicity flip is the behavior of the polarization @xmath2 : a change in the sign of the quantity @xmath2 as defined in equation ( [ helicity ] ) signals helicity flip ; otherwise no helicity flip .",
    "for the process of scattering ( [ espalhamento ] ) , we have the analytic expression from the feynman rules , @xmath27 and @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the photon propagator ( [ propagador ] )",
    ".    spinors @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfy the property ( we use feynman slash notation for contraction with dirac gamma matrices ) @xmath32 and the polarization vectors are given by @xmath33    we thus have @xmath34    using now the following properties for fermions with momentum @xmath35 and @xmath36 , we have : @xmath37    the @xmath38 and @xmath39 are matrix indices and we may rewrite the expression as @xmath40 where @xmath41 . using the trace properties for gamma matrices , we have @xmath42 \\right . \\times   \\notag \\\\ & & \\times \\left [ \\sqrt{e^{2}-m_{e}^{2}}(-e_{\\rm lab}+2m_{\\pi } ) + e_{\\rm lab}\\sqrt{% e^{2}-m_{e}^{2}}\\cos \\theta \\right ] + \\frac{\\left ( 4m_{\\pi } ^{2}-t_{\\rm lab}\\right ) } { m_{e}^{2 } }   \\notag \\\\ & & \\left ( e\\sqrt{e_{\\rm lab}^{2}-m_{e}^{2}}-e_{\\rm lab}\\sqrt{e^{2}-m_{e}^{2}}\\cos \\theta \\right ) \\left ( e_{\\rm lab}\\sqrt{e^{2}-m_{e}^{2}}-e\\sqrt{% e_{\\rm lab}^{2}-m_{e}^{2}}\\cos \\theta \\right ) +   \\notag \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left ( 4m_{\\pi } ^{2}-t_{\\rm",

    "we note that the scattered fermion polarizarion @xmath2 as given in equation ( [ helicity ] ) does not depend on the overall coefficient @xmath47 that appears in front of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the polarization does not depend on the characteristic podolsky s parameter @xmath18 .",
    "this means our result is independent of the character of the virtual photon propagator , whether it is given by the usual maxwell s theory or by the podolsky s approach to electromagnetism .",
    "we are working in the reference frame where the pion is at rest , that is , @xmath50 , with initial energy for the electron @xmath51 mev . in this case",
    ", we reproduce exactly the result obtained in reference @xcite , and our graph in figure [ fig : accioly ] is precisely their figure 7 .",
    "neither their figure 7 nor figure 8 of their article show that for fermion mass of the order of electron mass , there is a helicity flip as they claimed . even when the fermion mass gets larger than the electron mass there is only a change in the direction of the helicity ( not exactly paralel to the momentum direction ) , but still the helicity does not undergo sign change , so there is no flip .        in our graph of figure",
    "[ fig : sales ] , however , we have a curious effect : if we lower the electron energy from @xmath52 mev to @xmath53 mev , we observe a range of negative polarization , implying that helicity flip is occuring for increasing mass of the fermion .",
    "we have shown that the authors of reference @xcite have missed their point as far as their claim of helicity flip for electron interacting with podolsky s photon is concerned.their affirmation of helicity flip for the electron undergoing interaction with a scalar charged meson with an exchange of podolsky s type photon can not be substantiated .",
    "their graph does not corroborate for such an assertion and neither their allegation that this effect is due to the podolsky s photon is warranted .",
    "however , we have shown that for a particular lower energy for the electron , i.e. , 20 mev instead of 100 mev considered in reference @xcite we clearly see a helicity flip .",
    "morever , this flip has nothing to do with the interacting intermediate photon being _ a la _ podolsky or not , for the polarization factor does not depend on any podolsky s factor @xmath54 .",
