    "it is well known ( see , i.e. , @xcite ) that conventional numerical schemes such as runge - kutta , adams - bashforth , predictor - corrector and others produce misleading dynamics in the integration of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) .",
    "typical difficulties are , for instance , the convergence to spurious steady states , changes in the basis of attraction , appearance of spurious bifurcations , etc .",
    "the essence of such difficulties is that the dynamics of the numerical schemes ( viewed as discrete dynamical systems ) is far richer than that of its continuous counterparts .",
    "contrary to the common belief , drawbacks of this type may not be solved by reducing the step - size of the numerical method .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable the development of numerical integrators that preserve , as much as possible , the dynamical properties of the underlaying dynamical system for all step sizes or relative big ones . in this direction",
    ", some modest advances has been archived by a number of relative recent integrators of the class of exponential methods , which are characterized by the explicit use of exponentials to obtain an approximate solution .",
    "in fact , their development has been encouraged because their capability of preserving a number of geometric and dynamical features of the odes at the expense of notably less computational effort than implicit integrators .",
    "this have become feasible due to advances in the computation of matrix exponentials ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , dieci - papini00 , @xcite , @xcite ) and multiple integrals involving matrix exponentials ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some instances of this type of integrators are the methods known as exponential fitting @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , exponential integrating factor @xcite , exponential integrators hochbruck - etal98,@xcite , exponential time differencing @xcite , @xcite , truncated magnus expansion @xcite , @xcite , truncated fer expansion @xcite ( also named exponential of iterated commutators in iserles 1984 ) , exponential runge - kutta @xcite , hochbruck - ostermann05 , some schemes based on versions of the variation of constants formula ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , local linearization ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , jimenez05 amc , @xcite ) , and high order local linearization methods @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , hochbruck - ostermann11 .    the present paper deals with the class of high order local linearization integrators called local linearization - runge kutta ( llrk ) methods , which was recently introduced in @xcite as a flexible approach for increasing the order of convergence of the local linearization ( ll ) method while retaining its desired dynamical properties .",
    "essentially , the llrk integrators are obtained by splitting , at each time step , the solution of the underlying ode in two parts : the solution @xmath0 of a linear ode plus the solution @xmath1 of an auxiliary ode .",
    "the first one is solved by an ll scheme in such a way that the a - stability is ensured , while the second one is integrated by any high order explicit runge - kutta ( rk ) scheme .",
    "likewise implicit - explicit runge - kutta ( imex rk ) and conventional splitting methods ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) , the splitting involved in the llrk approximations is based on the representation of the underlying vector field as the addition of linear and nonlinear components .",
    "however , there are notable differences among these methods : i ) typically , in splitting and imex methods the vector field decomposition is global instead of local , and it is not based on a first - order taylor expansion .",
    "ii ) in contrast with imex and llrk approaches , splitting methods construct an approximate solution by composition of the flows corresponding to the component vector fields .",
    "iii ) imex rk methods are partitioned ( more specifically , additive ) runge - kutta methods that compute a solution @xmath2 by solving certain ode for @xmath3 , setting different rk coefficients for each block .",
    "llrk methods also solve a partitioned system for @xmath3 , but a different one . in this case ,",
    "one of the blocks is linear and uncoupled , which is solved by the ll method . after inserting the ( continuous time )",
    "ll approximation into the second block , this is treated as a non - autonomous ode , for which any extant rk discretization can be used . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth noting that the llrk methods can also be thought of a flexible approach to construct new a - stable explicit schemes based on standard explicit rk integrators . in comparison with the well known rosenbrock @xcite , shampine97 and exponential integrators @xcite , hochbruck - ostermann05",
    "the a - stability of the llrk schemes is achieved in a different way .",
    "basically , rosenbrock and exponential integrators are obtained by inserting a stabilization factor ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 , respectively ) into the explicit rk formulas , whose coefficients must then be determined to fulfil both a - stability and order conditions .",
    "in contrast , a - stability of an llrk scheme results from the fact that the component @xmath0 associated with the linear part of the vector field is computed through an a - stable ll scheme .",
    "another major difference is that the rk coefficients involved in the llrk methods are not constrained by any stability condition and they just need satisfy the usual order conditions for rk schemes .",
    "thus , the coefficients in the llrk methods can be just those of any standard explicit rk scheme .",
    "this makes the llrk approach greatly flexible and allows for simple numerical implementations on the basis of available subroutines for ll and rk methods .    in @xcite",
    ", @xcite a number of numerical simulations were carried out in order to illustrate the performance of the llrk schemes and to compare them with other numerical integrators . with special emphasis ,",
    "the dynamical properties of the llrk schemes were considered , as well as , their capability for integrating some kinds of stiff odes . for these equations , llrk schemes showed stability similar to that of implicit schemes with the same order of convergence , while demanding much lower computational cost .",
    "the simulations also showed that the llrk schemes exhibit a much better behavior near stationary hyperbolic points and periodic orbits of the continuous systems than others conventional explicit integrators .",
    "however , no theoretical support to such findings has been published so far .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to provide a theoretical study of llrk integrators .",
    "specifically , the following subjects are considered : rate of convergence , linear stability , preservation of the equilibrium points , and reproduction of the phase portrait of the underlying dynamical system near hyperbolic stationary points and periodic orbits .",
    "furthermore , unlike the majority of the previous papers on exponential integrators , this study is carried out not only for the discretizations but also for the numerical schemes that implement them in practice .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , the formulations of the ll and llrk methods are briefly reviewed .",
    "sections 3 and 4 deal with the convergence , linear stability and dynamic properties of llrk discretizations .",
    "section 5 focuses on the preservation of these properties by llrk numerical schemes . in the last section ,",
    "a new simulation study is presented in order to compare the performance of an specific order 4 llrk scheme and some matlab codes in a variety of odes representing different types of dynamics .",

    "adopting this linear approximation of @xmath11 at each time step , the solution of ( [ ode - lla-1])-([ode - lla-2 ] ) can be locally approximated on each interval @xmath31 by the solution of the linear ode@xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant matrix , @xmath34 is a linear vector function of @xmath30 . according to the variation of constants formula ,",

    "the local linear discretization  ( [ ode - lla-4 ] ) is , by construction , a - stable .",
    "furthermore , under quite general conditions , it does not have spurious equilibrium points @xcite and preserves the local stability of the exact solution at hyperbolic equilibrium points and periodic orbits @xcite , @xcite . on the basis of the recursion ( [ ode - lla-4 ] ) ( also known as exponentially fitted euler , euler exponential or piece - wise linearized method ) a variety of numerical schemes for odes has been constructed ( see a review in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these numerical schemes essentially differ with respect to the numerical algorithm used to compute ( [ ode - lla-7 ] ) , and so in the dynamical properties that they inherit from the ll discretization .",

    "figure 2 shows the path of the variable @xmath511 and its approximation @xmath512 obtained by the llrk@xmath513 scheme in the integration of these equations .",
    "remarkable , in all the examples , the relative error of the solution obtained by the llrk@xmath475 scheme is much lower that those of the ll@xmath245 , ode@xmath477 and ode@xmath495 with the same or lower number of steps .",
    "these results are easily comprehensible for five reasons : 1 ) the dynamics of these equations strongly depend on the linear part of their vector fields ; 2 ) the ll@xmath245 and llrk@xmath475 schemes preserve the stability of the linear systems for all step - sizes , which is not so for conventional explicit integrators ; 3 ) the ll@xmath245 and llrk@xmath475 schemes are able to``exactly '' ( up to the precision of the floating - point arithmetic ) integrate linear odes , which is a property not satisfied by for conventional explicit and implicit schemes ; 4 ) the ll@xmath245 and llrk@xmath475 schemes update the exact jacobian of the vector field at each integration step , which is not done by most of conventional schemes ; and 5 ) the llrk@xmath475 has higher order of convergence than the ll@xmath245 scheme .",
    "further , note that although the llrk@xmath475 scheme is not designed for the integration of stiff odes in general ( because the auxiliary equation ( [ ode - lls-14])-([ode - lls-14b ] ) might inherit  the stiffness of the original one ) it is clear that , by construction , it is suitable for equations with stiffness confined to the linear part .",
    "example are the classes of stiff linear and semilinear equations represented in the examples @xmath245 and @xmath514 .",
    "this is so , because at each integration step the stiff linear term is locally removed from the vector field of the auxiliary equation ( ode - lls-14 ) and , in this way , the stiff linear part is well integrated by the ( a - stable ) ll scheme and the resulting non - stiff equation ( ode - lls-14 ) can be well integrated by the explicit rk scheme .",

    "( solid line ) and its approximation @xmath512 ( dots ) obtained by the llrk4 scheme in the integration of the odes of examples 2 - 7 .",
    "the time partition @xmath14 used in each case for @xmath512 is specified in table ii .",
    "the `` exact '' path of @xmath511 is computed with the matlab code ode15s with @xmath522 on a very thin partition.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the results of the integration of last two equations for each scheme are also shown in table ii and figure @xmath245 . for these equations , the relative error of the solutions obtained by",
    "the llrk@xmath475 scheme is much lower that those of the ll@xmath245 , but quite similar to those of the codes ode@xmath477 and ode@xmath495 ( which have higher order of convergence ) .",
    "this indicates that the llrk@xmath513 scheme is also appropriate for integrating non - stiff and mild - stiff nonlinear problems as well .    in summary ,",
    "results of table ii clearly indicate that the non adaptive implementation of the llrk@xmath475 scheme provides similar or much better accuracy than the matlab codes with equal or lower number of steps in the integration of variety of equations .",
    "this suggests that adaptive implementations the llrk discretizations might archive similar accuracy than the matlab codes with lower or much lower number of steps , a subject that has been already studied in @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to point out that equations of type ( [ semi - linear ] ) frequently arises from the discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "in such a case , mild or high dimensional odes of that form are obtained and , as it is obvious , llrk schemes like ( [ llrk4 scheme ] ) based on pad approximations are not appropriate . nevertheless , because the flexibility of the high order local linearization approach described in section [ section lla ] , feasible high order ll schemes can be designed for this purpose too .",
    "for instance , by taking into account that @xmath523where @xmath524 , the llrk@xmath475 scheme ( [ llrk4 scheme ] ) can easily modified to defined an order @xmath475 llrk scheme for high dimensional odes .",
    "indeed , such scheme can be defined by the same expression ( [ llrk4 scheme ] ) , but replacing the formulas of @xmath525 and @xmath526 by @xmath527and@xmath528respectively , where @xmath529 denotes the approximation to @xmath135 provided by the krylov subspace method ( see , i.e. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , a comparison with exponential - type integrators designed for high dimensional equations of the form ( [ semi - linear ] ) can be carried out , but this subject is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "in summary , this paper has shown the following : 1 ) the llrk approach defines a general class of high order a - stable explicit integrators ; 2 ) in contrast with others a - stable explicit methods ( such as rosenbrock or the exponential integrators ) , the rk coefficients involved in the llrk integrators are not constrained by any stability condition and they just need to satisfy the usual , well - known order conditions of rk schemes , which makes the llrk approach more flexible and simple ; 3 ) llrk integrators have a number of convenient dynamical properties as the linearization preserving and the conservation of the exact solution dynamics around hyperbolic equilibrium points and periodic orbits ; 4 ) unlike the majority of the previous published works on exponential integrators , the above mentioned convergence , stability and dynamical properties are studied not only for the discretizations but also for the numerical schemes that implement them in practice ; 5 ) because of the flexibility in the numerical implementation of the llrk methods , specific - purpose schemes can be designed for certain classes of odes , e.g. , for stiff equations , high dimensional systems of equations , etc . ;",
    "6 ) order @xmath513 llrk formula considered in this paper provides similar or much better accuracy than the order @xmath476 matlab codes with equal or lower number of steps in the integration of variety of equations , as well as , much better reproduction of the dynamics of the underlying equation near stationary hyperbolic points .",
    "finally , it is worth to point out that theoretical properties of the llrk methods studied here strongly support the results of the numerical experiments carried out by the authors in previous works @xcite , @xcite , in which the performance of other llrk schemes is compared with that of existing explicit and implicit schemes .",
