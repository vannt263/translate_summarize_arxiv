    "to date , the most statistically significant trend in host star abundances pertains to metallicity .",
    "stars hosting giant , close - in planets have higher metallicities ( measured as [ fe / h]=log@xmath3(x ) - log@xmath3(x)@xmath0 , where log@xmath3(x)=log@xmath3(x / h)+12 ] ) than stars without detected giant planets ( e.g. , gonzalez 1998 & 2001 ; santos et al.2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ; ghezzi et al.2010 ) . statistical studies of dwarf stars hosting planets indicate a metallicity enhancement of @xmath20.15 dex for stars with giant planets and a 99.9994% probability that stars with / without giant planets are drawn from different parent populations ( buchhave et al .",
    "2012 ; ghezzi et al .",
    "2010 ) . however , the host star metallicity trend is weaker for neptune - sized planets ",
    "the difference in the mean [ fe / h ] of jovian - mass hosts versus neptunian - mass hosts is @xmath20.10 dex , with the neptune - mass hosts showing lower [ fe / h ] values ( e.g. , ghezzi et al.2010 ) .",
    "smaller planet ( r@xmath44 r@xmath5 ) host stars from the _ kepler _ sample show no metallicity enhancement , and have a flatter distribution of metallicities , though roughly peaked at solar .",
    "these smaller planet host stars have a probability between 0.98 and 0.9996 of originating from a different parent population as larger planet host stars from _ kepler _ ( buchhave et al.2012 ; everett et al.2013 ) .    looking beyond the correlation between planet size and stellar metallicity ,",
    "several studies have searched for other trends between planet parameters and host star abundances indicative of planet formation conditions .",
    "melndez et al.(2009 ) find through abundance analyses of 11 solar `` twins '' that the sun is deficient by @xmath220% in refractory elements , which have condensation temperatures @xmath6 900 k , relative to volatile elements when compared to other solar twins .",
    "this trend of decreasing refractory elemental abundances as a function of @xmath7 is suggested to be a signature of terrestrial planet formation  the `` missing '' refractory elements from the stellar photosphere are incorporated into rocky planets ( melndez et al.2009 ) .",
    "however , subsequent studies of similar precision measurements of solar analogs ( gonzlez hernndez et al.2010 ; gonzlez hernndez et al.2013 ) and stars with planets ( schuler et al.2011a & 2011b ) across a range of @xmath7 show that the abundance patterns of stars with and without planets are not significantly different , or may be indistinguishable from galactic chemical evolution effects . new evidence from jupiter- and neptune - sized planet host stars that are more metal - rich , or warmer than the sun and have less massive convective envelopes",
    ", indicates that the depletion signature may depend on the stellar convective envelope size at the time of planet formation , and thus the timescale of disk dispersal around different types of stars ( ramrez et al.2013 )    the growing number of transiting and directly - imaged exoplanet observations enable estimates of elemental and molecular abundances in the atmospheres of the planets themselves .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _ and _ spitzer space telescope _",
    ", aided by multiple ground - based facilities , have detected the most abundant molecules ( h@xmath8o , co , ch@xmath9 , co@xmath8 ) in the atmospheres of several of the brightest transiting planets ( e.g. , tinetti et al .",
    "2007 ; swain et al.2008 , 2009ab ; snellen et al.2010 ; beaulieu et al.2010 ) .",
    "ground - based observatories have made similar strides in studying the molecular properties of a handful of directly imaged self - luminous exoplanets ( e.g. , marois et al.2008 ; barman et al.2011ab ; skemer et al.2012 , 2013 ; konopacky et al.2013 ; janson et al.2013 ) .",
    "the differences and trends between the elemental compositions of host star and exoplanet atmospheres provide clues about the formation and evolution processes of planetary systems .",
    "carbon and oxygen are important players in the composition of stars and planets , as the third and fourth most abundant elements in the universe .",
    "the measurement of c and o in stars , especially with respect to iron , which is produced in both type ia and type ii supernovae , serves as a fundamental diagnostic of the chemical enrichment history of the galaxy .",
    "the impact of massive stars type ii supernovae , and thus the major oxygen contributor , lessens with time and increasing metallicity as the influence of low- and intermediate - mass stars carbon contribution grows .",
    "measuring c and o in exoplanets is diagnostic of current atmospheric composition and temperature structure : the atmospheric c / o ratio / n@xmath10=10@xmath11 . ]",
    "affects the molecular composition , and hence observed spectral signatures , through thermochemial equilibrium partitioning of carbon in co , ch@xmath12 , and co@xmath8 .",
    "the c / o ratio can also reflect where in the protoplanetary disk a planet formed , as well as subsequent migration and evolution ( e.g. , stevenson & lunine 1988 ; gaidos 2000 ; ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ; berg et al.2011 ) .",
    "theories of planet formation describe how close - in giant planets form in the outer protoplanetary disk , where icy planetesimals coalesce into a core , which accretes gas and migrates inwards ( e.g. , pollack et al.1996 ; owen et al.1999 ; ida & lin 2004b ) .",
    "the main molecular reservoirs of c and o have different condensation temperatures ( @xmath7 ) , so their relative amounts vary at different temperatures and disk radii , as do the amounts of these molecules in gas or solid form ( berg et al.2011 ) .",
    "gas and grains also move differently in the disk with time , as grains grow and decouple from the gas , sequestering solid material beyond the `` ice '' lines of different molecules ( e.g. , ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ; berg et al.2011 ) .",
    "the c / o ratio of a planet therefore does not necessarily reflect the protoplanetary - disk - averaged c / o ratio , and instead may point towards localized concentrations / depletions of carbon- and oxygen - bearing molecules ( ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ; berg et al.2011 ; najita et al.2013 ) .",
    "many groups have performed stellar abundance analyses of exoplanet host stars in order to determine their physical parameters ( t@xmath13 , log _ g _ , [ fe / h ] ) and chemical abundances , to further study the trends discussed above ( e.g. , delgado mena et al.2010 ; petigura & marcy 2011 ; brugamyer et al.2011 ; schuler et al.2011ab ; nissen 2013 ) .",
    "however , only a few transiting exoplanet host stars have published abundances other than [ fe / h ] or the more generic [ m / h ] ( e.g. , hd 209458 , schuler et al.2011a ; wasp-12 , petigura & marcy 2011 ; 55 cnc , bond et al.2010 & teske et al.2013b ; xo-2 , teske et al.2013a ) .    here",
    "we add to the small sample of transiting exoplanet host stars with measured abundances beyond [ fe / h ] , and the handful with measured c / o ratios .",
    "we report on sixteen transiting hot jupiters hosts to investigate the extent to which we can relate host star compositions to those of their planets , and search for carbon - rich planet formation environments .",
    "the sample presented here contains the host stars of some of the most - observed exoplanets whose atmospheres can and are being modeled to constrain their c / o ratios ( e.g. , madhusudhan 2012 ; moses et al.2013 ; line et al.2013 ) .",
    "this work provides a step toward comparing specific host star and exoplanet atmospheres to search for the chemical effects of exoplanet formation .",
    "our target list was chosen to include some of the best - studied hot jupiter s host stars that are observable from the northern hemisphere , and to include a range of planet radii , masses , and orbital periods .",
    "all but three of the planetary hosts in this sample have at least the 3.6 @xmath14 m , 4.5 @xmath14 m , 5.8 @xmath14 m , and 8.0 @xmath14 m diagnostic measurements of secondary eclipse depth from the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ) ( fazio et al.2004 ) .",
    "these data cover wavelengths with features of ch@xmath9 , co , co@xmath8 , and h@xmath8o , which are the most abundanct oxygen and carbon molecules in hot jupiter atmospheres .",
    "these measurements , in addition to @xmath15 and ground - based observations , are analyzed to infer the carbon and oxygen content in exoplanets ( moses et al .",

    "there are three sources of observations for this project : the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ; noguchi et al.2002 ) on the 8.2-m subaru telescope at mauna kea observatory , the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ; vogt et al.1994 ) at the keck i telescope , and the keck / hires archive .",
    "all observations are logged in table [ tab : log ] , and the platform configurations are detailed in table [ tab : platform ] . to facilitate a differential abundance analysis of these stars with respect to the sun ( as indicated by the bracket notation ) , spectra of the sun as reflected moonlight",
    "were taken at subaru / hds , and as reflected light from vesta at keck / hires ( pid n014hr ; pi marcy ) .",
    "the hds raw data were overscan - corrected , bias - subtracted , scattered - light subtracted , flat - fielded , extracted , and wavelength calibrated using standard techniques within the iraf software package using five bias frames , 20 flat fields , and thorium argon ( thar ) comparison lamp frames .",
    "all hires data were subject to a similar reduction procedure within the makee pipeline using corresponding bias ( @xmath23 ) , flat ( @xmath230 ) , thar , and trace star frames . multiple exposures of single targets were then summed in iraf .",
    "we also obtained keck / hires archive spectra of four targets that we originally observed with subaru / hds .",
    "the subaru / hds spectra were contaminated by atmospheric emission around the [ o i ] 6300 line , preventing a secure measurement of [ o / h ] ; the o i triplet at @xmath27775 was outside the subaru / hds wavelength coverage .",
    "thus the keck / hires archival data were used to verify the carbon abundance derived from the subaru / hds data , and to measure the oxygen abundance as described below .",
    "the four targets for which we obtained archival data are hat - p-7 ( pid a285hr ; pi bakos ; august 2008 ) , tres-3 ( pid c290hr ; pi herczeg ; june 2008 ) , hd 189733 ( pid a259hr ; pi winn ; august 2006 ) , and hd 149026 ( pid n59h ; pi marcy ; june 2005 ) .",
    "we determine stellar parameters ( t@xmath13 , log @xmath21 , microturbulence [ @xmath22 ) and elemental abundances of fe , c , ni , and o following the procedures in schuler et al.(2011a ) and teske et al.(2013a ) .",
    "briefly , the strength and shape of absorption lines in stellar spectra depend on the formation environment ( temperature , electron pressure ) and the number and excitations state of absorbers themselves and thus their atomic constants .",
    "thus one uses measurements from abundant , unblended lines in multiple ionization states  typically fe  to determine the stellar environment in which the observed line strengths form , in an interative manner .",
    "the `` best '' stellar model parameters  effective temperature , microturbulent velocity , log @xmath21 , and [ fe / h ]  results from fulfilling excitation equilibrium such that the [ fe / h ] values derived from the fe i lines do not show any correlation with the lower excitation potential of the lines ( @xmath23 ) , ionization equilibrium such that averaged abundances from fe i and fe ii lines are equal , and ensuring that fe i lines of all different equilvalent widths yield consisten abundances . specifically , the fe lines in this analysis are the same as in teske et al.(2013ab ) .",
    "the final fe line list contains 56 fe i and 10 fe ii lines , although not every fe line is measureable in every star in the sample .",
    "lower excitation potentials and transition probabilities for the fe lines are from the vienna atomic line database ( vald ; piskunov et al.1995 ; kupka et al.1999 ; ryabchikova et al.1999 ) .",
    "abundances of fe , c , and ni are derived from equivalent width ( ew ) measurements of spectral lines in each target individually ( sample subaru / hds spectra are shown in fig.[spectra_plots ] ) .",
    "the ew measurements are performed with the goal of mitigating errors of the fit  we use a gaussian profile to fit most lines , though some strong lines ( ew@xmath2490 m ) are fit with a voigt profile to account for the broader wings of the line at the continuum , and some weaker lines are fit with a simpson s rule approximation .",
    "the lines of the host stars are fit with either the one - dimensional spectrum analysis package spectre ( fitzpatrick & sneden 1987 ) or the ` splot ' task in iraf .",
    "the solar spectra corresponding to each target used to derive differential abundances were fit with the same package as the target , e.g. , where we use ew measurements from spectre , we use corresponding ew measurements from spectre of the sun in our analysis .",
    "the abundances are then determined with an updated version of the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) spectral analysis code moog ( sneden 1973 ) , with model atmospheres interpolated from the kurucz atlas9 grids . for oxygen",
    ", we use the spectral synthesis method of matching a set of trial synthetic spectra to the observed spectrum derive the abundance from the blended [ o i ] line at @xmath25 = 6300.3 ( see fig.[synth_fig ] ) .",
    "initial values of t@xmath13 , log @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and [ fe / h ] from the literature serve as our starting values in the iterative process of meeting the criteria outlined above . prior to this iterative scheme , for each target",
    "s ew measurements we ensure no correlation between @xmath23 and the ews of the fe i lines analyzed , as unique solutions for t@xmath13 and @xmath26 are only possible if there is no such initial correlation .",

    "uncertanties in the derived stellar parameters are calculated as detailed in teske et al.(2013a ) . in table",
    "[ tab : stellar_params ] we list the final derived stellar parameters and their 1@xmath27 uncertainties for each target , as well as the derived [ fe i / h ] and [ fe ii / h ] , the number of lines used in our analysis , and the uncertainy in the mean ( @xmath28 , where @xmath27 is the standard deviation of the derived abundances and @xmath3 is the number of lines used to derive the abundance . ] ) .",
    "a similar procedure as that used for the fe lines is used to identify and select lines for ni and c , with the same line lists as teske et al.(2013ab ) , which include 5 lines for carbon and 20 lines for nickel , though not every line was measureable in every star in our sample .",
    "the c and ni abundances are determined through standard ew analysis procedures with moog and the adopted stellar model for each target .",

    "all lines parameters , equivalent widths , and resulting abundances are available in the full online version of table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "we favor the two bluest c i lines ( 5052 and 5380 ) in our analysis because they arise from the lowest energy levels considered here and have negligible non - lte ( nlte ) corrections ( @xmath300.05 ; asplund et al.2005 ; takeda & honda 2005 ; caffau et al.2010 ) .",

    "the remaining three c i lines arise from higher energy levels , potentially making them more susceptible to nlte effects ( asplund 2005 ) , although asplund et al.(2005 ) find nlte corrections for these lines in the sun are comparable to those for the bluer c i lines . in cases where we find discrepant ( larger ) carbon abundances from the redder c i lines , we base our [ c / h ] measurement on the two bluest c i lines .    in hat - p-7 ,",
    "tres-3 , hd 149026 , and hd 189733 , [ o / h ] is not measurable with the subaru / hds data because the [ o i ] 6300 is contaminated by atmospheric emission and the wavelength coverage ends blueward of the o i triplet .",
    "the oxygen abundances of these four targets are instead measured from keck / hires archive data ( detailed below ) . in these cases",
    "the stellar parameters and [ ni / h ] derived from the subaru / hds data are carried through the analysis , but [ c / h ] is remeasured in the keck / hires data so that the c / o ratio originates completely from one data source . in all four cases the [ c / h]@xmath31 value is equal to the [ c / h]@xmath32 value within errors , with the differences all @xmath300.04 dex , giving confidence to this method .",
    "the oxygen abundances of the targets in our sample are determined from two indicators , the forbidden [ o i ] line at @xmath25 = 6300.3 and the o i triplet at 7771 - 7775 , depending on what data are available . for seven of the thirteen ( including xo-2s ) targets ,",
    "the oxygen abundance is derived solely from the subaru / hds data and the [ o i ] line , which is well - described by lte ( e.g. , takeda 2003 ) .",
    "we adopt the storey & zeippen ( 2000 ) log @xmath29 = -9.717 value , based on their forbidden transition probability calculations including both relativistically - corrected magnetic dipole and electric quadruopole contributions .",
    "however , the 6300.3 feature is blended with a ni i line composed of two isotopic components , with log @xmath29(@xmath33ni)=-2.695 and log @xmath29(@xmath34ni)=-2.275 ( johansson et al.2003 ; bensby et al.2004 ) . in the sun ,",
    "nickel accounts for @xmath230 - 40% of the [ o i ] absorption line depth ( caffau et al.2008 ; 2013 )",
    ". therefore , in determining [ o / h ] from this line , we account for the nickel component by measuring [ ni / h ] directly from each target s spectrum as described above and appropriately scaling the strength of the blend component due to nickel .",
    "we also test for potential blending in the 6300.3 [ o i ] line with another , much weaker , cn line ( davis & phillips 1963 ; sneden & lambert 1982 ) by fixing the carbon abundance to our measured [ c / h ] value and remeasuring the 6300 line oxygen abundance . except in the cases of xo-2n and xo-2s ( teske et al.2013b ) ,",
    "our resulting oxygen abundances do not change significantly ( @xmath300.02 log@xmath3(o ) ) by fixing the carbon abundance .",
    "the free parameters in our synthesis fits are the continuum normalization , wavelength shift , line broadening , and oxygen abundance ; we use our measured ni and c abundances for each star , and n scaled from solar based on the measured [ fe / h ] of each star .",

    "investigation , two larger studies of the c / o ratios of non - host stars versus host stars were conducted .",

    "they measure equivalent widths with the ares program ( sousa et al.2007 ) , and used moog and kurucz atlas9 model atmospheres ( kurucz1996 ) for abundance analysis .",

    "the goal of this paper is to investiage and constrain values of stellar host c / o ratios in systems with observed transiting giant planets , since transit spectroscopy potentially allows for determinations of the corresponding planetary c / o ratios .",
    "this goal is driven partially by the recent suggestion by fortney(2012 ) that the c / o ratios of both host- and non - host stars in the studies noted above have been overestimated due to errors in the derived c / o ratios and the observed apparent frequency of carbon dwarf stars implied by these studies .",
    "nissen(2013 ) recently rederived the carbon and oxygen abundances for 33 of delgado mena et al.(2010 ) s host stars that have additional eso 2.2 m feros spectra covering the o i triplet at 7774 , which was not originally used by delgado mena .",
    "he implements a differential analysis with respect to the sun , with equivalent widths of c and o measured in iraf with gaussian profiles and abundances derived by matching the observed equivalent widths with those measured in plane parallel marcs atmosphere models ( gustafsson et al.2008 ) having the same stellar parameters as those published by delgado mena et al.(2010 ) .",
    "accounting for nlte effects on the triplet line strengths by using the fabbian et al.(2009 ) corrections , nissen(2013 ) finds differences from delgado mena et al.(2010 ) in the derived oxygen abundances .",
    "this results in both a tighter correlation between [ fe / h ] and c / o ( nissen finds c / o = 0.56@xmath490.54[fe / h ] with an rms dispersion @xmath27(c / o)=0.06 ) , as well as a much smaller fraction of host stars with c / o@xmath180.8 ( only 1 out of 33 ) .",
    "the tight trend of increasing c / o with [ fe / h ] , e.g. , nissen ( 2013 ; as noted above ) , is indicative of the importance of overall galactic chemical evolution in setting the fraction of dwarf stars that might be carbon rich .",
    "the increase in c / o with metallicity points to the importance of low- and intermediate - mass star carbon nucleosynthesis at later , more metal - rich times .",
    "the influence of mass - star type ii supernovae , the major oxygen contributors , is diluted with time as low- and intermediate - mass stars become more important , thus c / o increases .",
    "the fraction of `` carbon - rich '' ( c / o @xmath240.8 ) planet - hosting stars is thus expected to increase with increasing metallicity in the disk , with the nissen trend indicating metallicities greater than [ fe / h]@xmath20.4 might begin to have significant fractions of carbon - rich dwarf stars .",
    "all of the planet - hosting stellar samples discussed here have very few , if any , stars at these metallicites or higher .",
    "this paper differs from the studies listed above because 1 ) the sample here is much smaller , being limited to only hosts of transiting exoplanets , and 2 ) only one non - host star is included ( the binary companion xo-2s ) . in figure [ comparison_plot1 ]",
    "the host star abundances derived here , shown with red filled circles with error bars , for [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] versus [ fe / h ] are compared to the results of the large samples of delgado mena et al.(2010 ) , shown as gray asterisks for host stars and open squares for non - host stars , and nissen(2013 ) , shown as blue asterisks .",
    "all three studies define similar behaviors of [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] as a function of [ fe / h ] , with the carbon exhibiting larger slopes with iron relative to oxygen ; this illustrates the increasing importance of carbon production from low- and intermediate - mass stars relative to massive stars with increasing chemical maturity .",
    "the slopes of the trends in figure [ comparison_plot1 ] are all quite similar , with the nissen ( 2013 ) trend exhibiting the smallest scatter about a linear fit . using the results of this paper , linear trends are fit to both [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] versus [ fe / h ] with the following results : [ c / h ] = 0.95[fe / h ] - 0.05 and [ o / h ] = 0.56[fe / h ] + 0.01 . excluding the apparently carbon - rich outlier hd 189733 , these fits are [ c / h ] = 1.02[fe / h ] - 0.08 and [ o / h ] = 0.56[fe / h ] + 0.01 ; we refer to these fits without hd 189733 throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "quantitatively , the c versus fe slope is about twice as large ( in dex ) as that for o versus fe based on the linear fits to the abundances derived here .",
    "the relation for carbon passes 0.08 dex below solar ( i.e. , at [ fe / h],[c / h]=0,0 ) while passing close to solar for oxygen , offset by only + 0.01 dex .",
    "because of these even rather small offsets ( @xmath20.05 - 0.1 dex ) , the c / o ratios as a function of [ fe / h ] might fall below solar as defined by our results for this particular sample of stars : an offset of -0.05 to -0.1 dex in [ c / o ] would correspond to an offset of 0.1 to 0.2 lower in a linear value of c / o .",
    "this does not necessarily correspond to simply errors in the analysis , but may reflect both fitting linear relations to our results , which are probably only approximate descriptions of the real galactic disk relation , as well as there not being a universal trend of [ c or o]/h versus [ fe / h ] .",
    "the offsets here most probably reflect both uncertainties in the analysis ( already discussed in section 3.2 ) and intrinsic scatter in real galactic disk populations that will map onto the sample of stars analyzed here .",
    "figure [ comparison_plot2 ] illustrates values of c / o versus [ fe / h ] from this study , along with those values from delgado mena et al.(2010 ) and nissen ( 2013 ) .",
    "all three studies find a clear increase in c / o verus [ fe / h ] , which represents the signature of galactic chemical evolution , as discussed previously .",
    "the relation in c / o in this work falls somewhat below those of the other two studies , but all three exhibit similar slopes .",
    "this similarity is born out by a quantitative comparison of c / o versus [ fe / h ] between nissen ( 2013 ) and this study .",
    "nissen derived a linear fit of c / o = 0.54[fe / h ] + 0.56 , while the same fit to the results here find c / o = 0.53[fe / h ] + 0.45 .",
    "the adopted solar value in this study of c / o = 0.54 is larger by 0.09 than the value defined by the best - fit linear relation defined by our sample of stars and our results . including the outlier hd 189733 in our linear fit results in c / o = 0.43[fe / h ] + 0.49 , corresponding to a c / o ratio 0.05 smaller than the solar value of 0.54 ; including this outlier increases the scatter around the fit from 0.04 to 0.1 .",
    "a linear difference of 0.09 corresponds to 0.08 dex for the solar - relative [ c / o ] , which is comparable to the repsective offsets of -0.08 dex and + 0.01 dex in the [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] relations .",
    "another way of investigating the inherent scatter within our results is to remove the linear best - fit from the values of c / o and look at the scatter about the fitted relation . when this is done the median residual scatter in c / o is @xmath200.04 , or 0.03 dex in [ c / o ] .",
    "this comparison of c / o versus [ fe / h ] trends between nissen ( 2013 ) and this study indicates that the derived slopes are very similar , but there remain small offsets in zero - point c / o of @xmath2 0.10 - 0.15 caused by a combination of differences in ( presumably ) the stellar samples , the adopted solar c / o ratios ( 0.58 for nissen and 0.54 for this study ) , as well as the abundance analysis , e.g. , much of the offset is due to somewhat smaller values of [ c / h ] at our lower metallicity range .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of the [ c / h ] , [ o / h ] , and c / o distributions from this study , as well as those from all the previous studies of host star carbon and oxygen abundances mentioned above , are listed in table [ tab : compare2 ] .",
    "the mean [ c / h ] of the transiting exoplanet hosts in this paper is less than the mean [ c / h]@xmath50 from the previous works , 0.14 in the five previous studies versus 0.08 found here .",
    "the mean [ o / h ] value found in our sample is the same as the mean [ o / h]@xmath50 from previous studies , 0.07 .",
    "however , the standard deviations of [ c / h]@xmath51 and [ o / h]@xmath51 from this paper are large , 0.20 and 0.13 , respectively , so any differences in our mean [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] values are to be viewed with caution .",
    "the mean c / o ratio of the transiting exoplant host stars in our sample is 0.54 , with a standard deviation of 0.15 , versus the mean from the previous papers of 0.71 with a standard deviation of 0.07 . therefore , the sample of carbon and oxygen abundance ratios for transiting exoplanet host stars presented here , while marginally consistent , are on average lower than those measured by other groups for non - transiting exoplanet host stars .",
    "our measurements are more in line with the suggestions by fortney(2012 ) and nissen ( 2013 ) that prior studies overestimated c / o ratios ; the mean c / o@xmath52 of nissen is 0.63@xmath200.12 .",
    "however , as noted by fortney(2012 ) , each previous study scales their c / o ratios based on different log@xmath3(c)@xmath0 and log@xmath3(o)@xmath0 values .",

    "accounting for the difference in log@xmath3(c)@xmath0 and log@xmath3(o)@xmath0 decreases the average c / o ratios from the other sources ( from top to bottom ) in table [ tab : compare2 ] by @xmath20.15 , @xmath20.13 , @xmath20.11 , and @xmath20.05 , closer to the average c / o ratio we derive for our sample .",

    "this underscores the caution , as mentioned in fortney(2012 ) and nissen(2013 ) , required when directly comparing c / o ratios derived from different groups .",
    "we now focus on the c / o ratios in each studied system to investigate possible links between host star c / o ratios with planetary and system properties .",
    "presently there are two major observed trends relating stellar chemical composition to the presence of planets ",
    "hot jupiter exoplanets are more often found around intrinsically higher - metallicity stars ( e.g. , fischer & valenti 2005 ) , and the fraction of stars with giant planets increases with stellar mass ( e.g. , johnson et al.2010 ; ghezzi et al.2010 ; gaidos et al.2013 ) .",
    "measuring potential host stars chemical abundance distributions may develop into a powerful tool for inferring the presence , or even specific type ( size , orbit , composition ) , of exoplanets around different types of stars .",
    "this technique is of increasing importance in the context of large surveys that are discovering exoplanets , and targeted studies of unusual or potentially - habitable exoplanets .    in this study",
    "we explore whether the stellar c / o ratio has predictive power with respect to hot jupiter properties , particularly the exoplanetary atmosphere compositions .",
    "characteristic observations of the atmospheres of the exoplanets in this sample  the _ spitzer / irac _ 3.6 , 4.5 , 5 . , and 8.0 @xmath14 m secondary eclipse fluxes  as well as their physical properties like mass , radius , semi - major orbital axis , period , and equlibrium temperature were gathered from the nasa exoplanet archive and compared to host star c / o ratios . by eye",
    "it appears that planet radius and planet equlibrium temperature may decrease with increasing c / o@xmath55 ( fig.[pparam ] ) , but these trends are dominated by one or two points and , once these points are removed , no significant trends with planet parameters are found .",
    "we also find weak negative correlations between each system s c / o@xmath56 and planetary _",
    "spitzer_/irac secondary eclipse fluxes ( e.g. , @xmath57 - 0.4 to -0.6 ) , but these correlations are not statistically significant ( @xmath580.05 ) .    this lack of trends between c / o@xmath55 is perhaps not surprising . the hot jupiter host stars in this sample were chosen based on the amount of observational data that exists for their planets , and thus how `` characterizable '' their planets atmospheres are , with the goal of directly comparing star and planet c / o ratios .",
    "no planetary or stellar parameters serve as `` control variables '' in this study , and our sample is actually diverse in both respects . the host stars span 5100@xmath59t@xmath356470 k , -0.21@xmath59[fe / h]@xmath590.44 , and spectral types f6 through k1 . the planets in our sample range in mass from @xmath20.5 - 4.2 m@xmath19 , in period from @xmath21.09 - 111 days ( with the second longest being 4.5 days ) , in density from @xmath20.2 - 8 g @xmath60 ( with the second most - dense being 3.4 g @xmath60 ) , and in equilibrium temperature from @xmath2400 - 2500 k. that we do not find a significant correlation between c / o@xmath55 and any of these planetary parameters implies that ( 1 ) our sample may yet be too small to reveal distinct trends , and/or ( 2 ) the influence of the host star c / o ratio is a more complex function of multiple parameters of the planet and/or its formation history .",
    "while ( 1 ) is possible , ( 2 ) also seems likely and could result in the c / o ratio comparison between stars and planets serving a more interesting function .",
    "in protoplanetary disks , different condensation fronts due to temperature and the movement of gas and grains in the disk can change the relative ratios and/or of carbon and oxygen as compared to those in the parent star ( stevenson & lunine 1988 ; lodders 2010 ; ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ; berg et al .",
    "in particular , the enhancement or depletion of water and thus oxygen is sensitive to the size and migration of icy solids in the disk , so the c / o ratios of the inner and outer disk regions evolve with time and depend on both initial conditions and the efficiency with which solids grow to large sizes ( ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ; najita et al.2013 ) .",
    "overall , the final c / o@xmath61 does not necessarily reflect the c / o@xmath62 , and depends on the location and timescale of formation , how much of the atmosphere is accreted from gas versus solids , and how isolated the atmosphere is from mixing with core materials ( ciesla & cuzzi 2006 ; berg et al.2011 ) . in our own solar system gas",
    "giant planets , oxygen is not well constrained because water , the major oxygen carrier , condenses deeper down in their cool ( t@xmath30125 k ) atmospheres , out of the observable range of remote spectra ( madhusudhan 2012 ) . however , carbon is known to be enhanced above solar by factors of @xmath22 - 6 , 6 - 11 , 18 - 50 , and 28 - 63 in jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune , respectively ( wong et al.2008 and references therein ) . thus , though the composition of the host star provides a good estimate of the system c / o ratio and the natal molecular cloud environment , differences between the host star and planetary c / o ratios may be common , and may be used to probe where and when in the disk the planet formed .",
    "a third possibility is that the host star c / o ratio has no connection to the formation of planets and is not a useful metric for distinguishing planet types .",
    "however , theoretical results ( e.g. , johnson et al.2012 ; ali - dib et al.2013 ) demonstrating the influence of the host star c / o ratio on the composition of protoplanetary disk , and recent observations ( e.g. , najita et al.2013 ; favre et al.2013 ) indicating that disks themselves likely have a range of c / o ratios which are related to other planet formation parameters ( mass of the disk , grain growth and composition , etc . ) , suggest that c / o ratios of host stars do play a role , at some stage , in planet formation .      a small fraction of exoplanets , mostly hot jupiters orbiting very close to their host stars ,",

    "as discussed in the introduction , a gas giant planet s c / o ratio has important implications for its composition . at the temperatures and pressures characteristic of such atmospheres , a high c / o ratio ( @xmath630.8 )",

    "the dayside spectrum of wasp-12b is best explained by a featureless 3000 k blackbody ( crossfield et al.2012 ) .",
    "subsequent data ( sing et al.2013 ) do not detect metal hydrides mgh , crh , and tih or any ti - bearing molecules , which were previously suggested as indicative of high - c / o ratio scenarios ( madhusudhan 2012 ; swain et al.2013 ) .    a c / o@xmath661 composition for wasp-12b is also consistent with the study of line et al.(2013 ) , who use a systematic temperature and abundance retrieval analysis , combining differential evolution mcmc with an optimal - estimation - based prior , to rule out strong temperature inversion in wasp-12b s atmosphere and thus the presence of tio causing such an inversion .",

    "recent directly - imaged , moderate - resolution ( @xmath944000 ) spectra from @xmath21.97 - 2.38 @xmath14 m of hr 8799c show absorption of co and h@xmath8o but little to no ch@xmath9 ( mixing ratio @xmath6610@xmath79 ) .",
    "@xmath89 minimization modeling of these data finds best - fit log@xmath3(c ) and log@xmath3(o ) values of 8.33 and 8.51 , respectively , indicating hr 8799c is depleted in both c and o with respect to solar , and resulting in a c / o ratio of 0.65@xmath95 ( konoapacky et al.2013 ) .",
    "the host star is classified as both @xmath96 doradus and @xmath25 bootis , making stellar abundance analysis challenging , but one previous study of the star derives c / o=0.56@xmath200.21 ( sadakane 2006 ) .",
    "determining the c / o ratios of the other planetary components in this system , and other multi - planet systems , may provide constraints on how the composition of the host star affects giant planet formation as a function of planet mass and orbital radius .",
    "the differences between [ fe / h ] distributions in hosts versus non - hosts have been the subject of study for over a decade , and a few more recent studies suggest that refractory element distributions may differ in stars with / without planets , but differences in volatile elements have not been as thoroughly explored . here",
    "we present a uniform stellar parameter and abundance analysis of 16 stars that host transiting hot jupiter exoplanets .",
    "our study also includes one binary companion that is not known to host planets .",
    "this work presents detailed measurements of transiting exoplanet host star carbon and oxygen abundances , derived using muliple indicators of oxygen abundance .",
    "the derived host star c / o ratios contribute one component to the direct comparison of stellar and exoplanetary atmospheric compositions .",
    "we compare our results to other studies of c / o vs. [ fe / h ] in exoplanet host stars , and find a similar positive slope between these two parameters .",
    "this is indicative of galactic chemical evolution and the increasing importance of the carbon contribution from the death of low- and intermediate - mass stars at more metal - rich times in the galaxy .",
    "a linear fit to our [ c / h ] versus [ fe / h ] data results in a slope @xmath2twice that of a linear fit to our [ o / h ] vs. [ fe / h ] , with the former relation passing 0.08 dex below solar and the latter passing 0.01 above solar .",
    "we derive a linear fit of c / o=0.53[fe / h ] + 0.45 to our data , which falls 0.09 below our adopted c / o@xmath0=0.54 , but corresponds to a 0.08 dex difference in [ c / o ] , similar to the offsets in [ c / h ] and [ o / h ] relations .",
    "these offsets likely reflect both analysis uncertainties and the real , intrinsic scatter in galactic disk populations",
    ".    there is agreement between the average [ c / h ] , [ o / h ] , and c / o values found here and the results of other studies of rv - detected planet host stars , supporting previous findings ( ammler von - eiff et al.2009 ) that elemental abundance ratios do not differ significantly between transiting and rv - planet host stars .",
    "the mean c / o ratio of the transiting exoplanet host stars in this paper is slightly lower than that found by other studies that consist of non - transiting host stars , 0.54@xmath200.15 versus 0.71@xmath200.07 .",
    "this is more in line with recent suggestions that the prior studies overestimated c / o ratios .",
    "several cases in which the process of directly comparing the chemistry in specific stars to their planets is already beginning are highlighted ",
    "wasp-12 , xo-1 , tres-2 , tres-3 , hd 149026 , xo-2 , corot-2 , and hd 189733 .",
    "we encourage follow - up observational and theoretical studies of all of the exoplanets whose host stars are included in this paper .",
    "facilities that are currently available in space and on the ground can be used strategically to obtain estimates of c / o ratios of a large sample of transiting exoplanets , which jwst and several other upcoming space - based missions ( e.g. , echo ) will be able to better characterize .",
    "the more precise abundance analysis that is possible right now for host stars can help infer their exoplanets formation histories , as well as inform future planet formation theories and models .",
    "the authors wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of mauna kea has always had within the indigenous hawaiian community .",
    "we are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain .",
    "this work would not have been possible without the efforts of the daytime and nighttime support staff at the mauna kea observatory and subaru telescope , particularly akito tajitsu , rita morris , and jennie berghuis .",
    "the authors also thank the anonymous referee for her / his helpful corrections and comments .",
    "the work of j. t. and c. g. is suppored by nasa s planetary atmospheres program .",
    "j.t . thanks andy skemer for his aid in interpreting directly - imaged planet results .",
    "this research has made use of the exoplanet orbit database and the exoplanet data explorer at exoplanets.org .",
