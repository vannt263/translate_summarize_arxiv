    "the primary purpose of the current paper is to show that , as a matter of principle , contrary to discerning lore that is realized in many fascinating systems , e.g. , @xcite , the appearance of a _ topological _ ground state degeneracy _ does not _ imply that these degenerate states are `` topologically ordered '' , in the sense that local perturbations can be detected without destroying the encoded quantum information @xcite . towards this end ,",
    "we introduce various models , including a classical version of kitaev s toric code @xcite , that exhibit robust genus dependent degeneracies but are nonetheless landau ordered .",
    "those models do not harbor long - range entangled ground states that can not be told apart from one another by local measurements .",
    "rather , they ( as well as all other eigenstates ) are trivial classical states . along the way we will discover that these two - dimensional classical models ( including rather mundane clock and @xmath0 gauge like theories with four spin interactions ( specifically , toric clock and @xmath0 theories that we will define ) may not only have genus dependent symmetries and degeneracies but",
    ", for various lattice types , may also exhibit _ holographic _ degeneracies that scale exponentially in the system perimeter .",
    "similar degeneracies also appear in classical systems having two spin interactions .",
    "thus , the classical degeneracies that we find may be viewed as analogs of those in quantum models such as the haah code model on the simple cubic lattice @xcite , a nontrivial theory with eight spin interactions that is topologically quantum ordered , and other quantum systems .",
    "to put our results in a broader context , we first succinctly review current basic notions concerning the different possible types of order .",
    "the celebrated symmetry - breaking paradigm @xcite has seen monumental success across disparate arenas of physics .",
    "its traditional textbook applications include liquid to solid transitions , magnetism , and superconductivity to name only a few examples out of a very vast array . within this paradigm ,",
    "distinct thermodynamic phases are associated with local observables known as order parameter(s ) . in the symmetric phase(s ) , these order parameters must vanish .",
    "however , when symmetries are lifted , the order parameter may become non - zero .",
    "phase transitions occur at these symmetry breaking points at which the order parameter becomes non - zero ( either continuously or discontinuously ) .",
    "landau @xcite turned these ideas into a potent phenomenological prescription .",
    "indeed , long before the microscopic theory of superconductivity @xcite , ginzburg and landau @xcite wrote down a phenomenological free energy form in the hitherto unknown complex order parameter with the aid of which predictions may be made .",
    "albeit its numerous triumphs , the symmetry - breaking paradigm might not directly account for transitions in which symmetry breaking can not occur .",
    "pivotal examples are afforded by gauge theories of the fundamental forces and very insightful abstracted simplified renditions capturing their quintessential character , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "theorem @xcite prohibits symmetry breaking in gauge theories .",
    "another notable example where the symmetry breaking paradigm can not be directly applied is that of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition @xcite in two - dimensional systems with a global @xmath0 symmetry . by the mermin - wagner - hohenberg - coleman theorem and its extensions @xcite ,",
    "such continuous symmetries can not be spontaneously broken in very general two - dimensional systems .    augmenting these examples , penetrating work illustrated that something intriguing may happen when the quantum nature of the theory is of a defining nature @xcite . in particular ,",
    "strikingly rich behavior was found in fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems @xcite , chiral spin liquids @xcite , a plethora of exactly solvable models , e.g. , @xcite , and other systems .",
    "one curious characteristic highlighted in @xcite concerns the number of degenerate ground states in fqh fluids @xcite , chiral spin liquids @xcite , and other systems .",
    "namely , in these theories , the ground state ( g.s . ) degeneracy is set by the topology alone .",
    "for instance , regardless of general perturbations ( including impurities that may break all the symmetries of the hamiltonian ) , when placed on a manifold of genus number @xmath1 ( the determining topological characteristic ) , the fqh liquid at a laughlin type filling of @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 an odd integer ) universally has @xmath4 orthogonal ground states @xcite .",
    "_ equation ( [ top_deg ] ) constitutes one of the best known realization of topological degeneracy . _",
    "exact similarity transformations connect the second quantized fqh systems of equal filling when these are placed on different surfaces sharing the same genus @xcite . making use of the archetypal topological quantum phenomenon , the aharonov - bohm effect @xcite",
    ", it was argued that , when charge is quantized in units of @xmath5 ( as it is for laughlin states ) , the minimal ground state degeneracy is given by the righthand side of eq .",
    "( [ top_deg ] ) @xcite .",
    "this may appear esoteric since realizing fqh states on riemann surfaces is seemingly not feasible in the lab .",
    "recent work @xcite proposed the use of an annular superconductor - insulator - superconductor josephson junction in which the insulator is ( an electron - hole double layer ) in a fqh state ( of an identical filling ) for which this degeneracy is not mathematical fiction but might be experimentally addressed .",
    "associated fractional josephson effects of this type in parafermionic systems were advanced in @xcite .    historically , the robust topological degeneracy of eq .",
    "( [ top_deg ] ) for fqh systems and its counterparts in chiral spin liquids suggested that such a degeneracy may imply the existence of a novel sort of order  `` topological quantum order '' present in kitaev s toric code model @xcite , haah s code @xcite , and numerous other quantum systems @xcite  a quantum order for which no local landau order parameter exists . as we will later review and make precise ( see eq .",
    "( [ tqo ] ) ) , in topologically ordered systems , no local measurement may provide useful information .",

    ", it may be readily established that an identical degeneracy appears for all excited states ; that is the degeneracy of each energy level is an integer multiple of @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the minimal degeneracy amongst all energy levels is given by @xmath9 .",
    "same ground state degeneracy @xcite appears in kitaev s honeycomb model @xcite .",
    "as is widely known , an identical situation occurs in the quantum dimer model @xcite . invoking the well - known `` @xmath10ality '' considerations of @xmath11 , leading to a basic spin of 1/2 in @xmath12 and a minimal quark charge of 1/3 in @xmath13 , it was suggested @xcite that in many systems , fractional charges ( quantized in units of @xmath14 ) are a trivial consequence of the @xmath15 phase group center structure of a system endowed with an @xmath11 symmetry , which is associated with the @xmath16 states comprising the ground state manifold .",
    "this @xmath16-ality type phase factors and other considerations , prompted sato @xcite to suggest the use of topological degeneracy ( akin to that of eqs .",
    "( [ top_deg ] ) and ( [ tcd ] ) ) as a theoretical diagnosis delineating the boundary between the confined and the topological deconfined phases of qcd in the presence of dynamical quarks .",
    "other notable examples include , e.g. , the bf action for superconductors ( carefully argued to not support a local order parameter @xcite ) .    references @xcite examined the links between various concepts surrounding topological order with a focus on the absence of local order parameters . in particular ,",
    "building on a generalization of elitzur s theorem @xcite it was shown how to construct and classify theories for which no local order parameter exists both at zero and at positive temperatures ; this extension of elitzur s theorem unifies the treatment of classical systems , such as gauge and berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type theories in arbitrary number of space ( or spacetime ) dimensions , to topologically ordered systems .",
    "moreover , it was demonstrated that a sufficient condition for the existence of topological quantum order is the explicit presence , or emergence , of symmetries of _ dimension @xmath17 lower _ than the system s dimension @xmath18 , dubbed @xmath17-dimensional gauge - like symmetries , and which lead to the phenomenon of _ dimensional reduction_. the topologically ordered ground states are connected by these low - dimensional operator symmetries @xcite .",
    "all known examples of systems displaying topological quantum order host these low dimensional symmetries , thus providing a unifying framework and organizing principle for such an order .",
    "as underscored by numerous pioneers , features such as fractionalization and quasiparticle statistics , e.g. , @xcite , edge states @xcite , nontrivial entanglement @xcite , and other fascinating properties seem to relate with the absence of local order parameters and permeate topological quantum order . while all of the above features appear and complement the topological degeneracies found in , e.g. , the fqh ( eq .",
    "( [ top_deg ] ) ) , the toric code ( eq . ( [ tcd ] ) ) , and numerous other systems , it is not at all obvious that one property ( say , a topological degeneracy such as those of eqs .",
    "( [ top_deg ] ) and ( [ tcd ] ) ) implies another attribute ( for instance , the absence of meaningful local observables ) .",
    "the current work will indeed precisely establish the absence of such a rigid connection between these two concepts ( viz .",
    ", topological degeneracy is not at odds with the existence of a local order parameter ) .",
    "we will employ the lack of local order parameters ( or , equivalently , an associated robustness to local perturbations ) as the defining feature of topological quantum order @xcite .",
    "this robustness condition implies that local errors can be detected , and thus corrected , without spoiling the potentially encoded quantum information . to set the stage , in what follows",
    ", we consider a set of @xmath19 orthonormal ground states@xmath20 with a spectral gap to all other ( excited ) states .",
    "specifically @xcite , a system will be said to exhibit topological order at zero temperature if and only if for _ any quasi - local operator _",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a constant , independent of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is a correction that is either zero or vanishes ( typically exponentially in the system size ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the physical content of eq .",
    "( [ tqo ] ) is clear : no possible quantity @xmath21 may serve as an order parameter to differentiate between the different ground states in the `` algebraic language '' @xcite where @xmath21 is local @xcite .",
    "that is , all ground states look identical locally .",
    "similarly , no local operator @xmath21 may link different orthogonal states  the ground states are immune to all local perturbations .",
    "notice the importance of the physical , and consequently mathematical , language to establish topological order : a physical system may be topologically ordered in a given language but its dual ( that is isospectral ) is not @xcite",
    ".    expressed in terms of the simple equations that we discussed thus far , the goal of this work is to introduce systems for which the ground state sector has a genus dependent degeneracy ( as in eqs .",
    "( [ top_deg ] ) and ( [ tcd ] ) ) while , nevertheless , certain local observables ( or order parameters ) @xmath21 will be able to distinguish between different ground states ( thus violating eq .",
    "( [ tqo ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , they will be connected by global symmetry operators as opposed to low - dimensional ones .",
    "our conclusions are generic and , as shown , they apply to many classical models .",
    "the paradigmatic counterexample that we will introduce is a new classical version of kitaev s toric code model @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the outline of the paper . in section [ general ] ,",
    "we generalize the standard ( quantum ) toric code model .",
    "after a brief review and analysis of the ground states of kitaev s toric code model ( section [ toric_quantum ] ) , we exclusively study our classical systems . in section [ toric_classical ]",
    ", we extensively study the ground states of the classical variant of the model for different square lattices on riemann surfaces of varying genus numbers @xmath27",
    ". a principal result will be that this and many other _ classical systems exhibit a topological degeneracy_. we will demonstrate that an intriguing holographic degeneracy may appear on lattices of a certain type .",
    "as will be explained , topological as well as exponentially large in system linear size ( `` holographic '' ) degeneracies can appear in numerous systems , not only in this new classical version of kitaev s toric code model @xcite .",
    "we further study the effect of lattice defects . the partition function of the classical toric code model is revealed in section [ ctc ] and appendix [ z ] .    in section [ sec : clock ] ,",
    "we introduce related classical clock models . generalizing the considerations of section [ toric_classical ]",
    ", we will demonstrate that these clock models may exhibit topological or holographic degeneracies .",
    "the ensuing analysis is richer by comparison to that of the classical toric code model . towards this end",
    ", we will construct a new framework for broadly examining degeneracies .",
    "we then derive lower bounds on the degeneracy that are in agreement with our numerical analysis .",
    "these bounds are _ not confined to the ground state sector_. that is , all levels may exhibit topological degeneracies ( as they do in the classical toric code model ( section [ ctc ] ) ) .    in section [ u1sec ] , we will relate our results to @xmath0 models and to @xmath0 lattice gauge theories in particular .",
    "the fact that simple lattice gauge systems , that constitute a limiting case of our more general studied models , such as the conventional classical clock and @xmath0 lattice gauge theories _ on general riemann surfaces _ ( and their toric code extensions ) , _ exhibit topological _ ( or , in some cases , holographic ) _ degeneracies _ seems to have been overlooked until now . in section [ lattice_type ] , we will study honeycomb and triangular lattice systems embedded on surfaces of different genus . in section [ mm ] , we will discuss yet three more regular lattice classical systems that exhibit holographic degeneracies .",
    "we summarize our main message and findings in section [ conclusionss ] .    before embarking on the specifics of these various models , we briefly highlight the organizing principle behind the existence of degeneracies in our theories",
    ". irrespective of the magnitude and precise form of the interactions in these theories , the number of independent constraints between the individual interaction terms sets the system degeneracy . as such ,",
    "the degeneracies that we find are , generally , _ not a consequence of any particular fine - tuning_.",
    "we start with a general description of a class of two - dimensional stabilizer models defined on lattices embedded on closed manifolds with arbitrary genus number @xmath1 ( the number of handles or , equivalently , the number of holes ) .",
    "the genus of a closed orientable surface is related to a topological invariant known as euler characteristic @xmath28 which , for a general tessellation of that surface , satisfies the ( euler ) relation @xmath29 in eq .",
