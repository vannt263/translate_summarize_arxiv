    "the main computational challenges associated with the modelling of hydraulic fractures are : a ) strong nonlinearity resulting from the coupling between the solid and fluid phases , b ) singularity of the gradients of the physical fields near the crack tip , c ) moving boundaries , d ) degeneration of the governing equations at the crack tip , multiscaling and others .    to achieve the maximal possible efficiency of numerical simulations",

    "this model contains all the peculiarities mentioned above , except for the non - local relation for the fluid - solid coupling .",
    "although we restrict our interest only to a single fracture , the developed algorithms , thanks to their robustness , can be successfully applied to model a system of cracks .",

    "the classic mathematical formulation of the pkn model of hydrofracturing was given in @xcite .",
    "below we present a system of equations constituting the model .",
    "the mass conservation principle is expressed by the continuity equation : @xmath9 while the poiseuille equation describes the flow in a narrow channel . in the case of a newtonian fluid",
    ", it is written in the following form : @xmath10 here @xmath11 stands for the crack opening , @xmath12 is the fluid flow rate , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 - confining stress ) refers to the net fluid pressure .",
    "the constant @xmath16 , involved in the poiseuille equation , is computed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the dynamic viscosity ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath19 from is the volumetric rate of fluid loss to formation in the direction perpendicular to the crack surfaces per unit length of the fracture .",
    "this function is usually assumed to be given , but it may depend on the solution itself as well . to account for various leak - off regimes , we accept the following behaviour of @xmath20 : @xmath21 for some constant @xmath22 . note that the case @xmath23 corresponds to the carter law @xcite , while @xmath24 guarantees that the leak - off vanishes near the crack tip as fast as the crack opening at least ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    "the group of fluid equations is to be supplemented by the relation describing deformation of the rock under applied hydraulic pressure . in the case of the pkn model ,",
    "a linear relationship between the net fluid pressure and crack opening is in use : @xmath25 where a known proportionality coefficient @xmath26 is found from the solution of a plane strain elasticity problem @xcite for an elliptical crack of height @xmath27 .",

    "it was shown in @xcite and @xcite that the asymptotic behaviours of @xmath35 and @xmath36 near the crack tip are interrelated , and the first term of the expansion for the crack opening may be written as : @xmath37 for the classic pkn model the exponent @xmath38 was found in @xcite .",
    "thus condition ( [ bc_2])@xmath39 is always satisfied as it follows from ( [ poiseulle_1 ] ) and ( [ elastic_1 ] ) . as a result , the model does not account for the standard stress singularity of fracture mechanics at the crack tip , and thus is relevant for the so - called zero toughness regime ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "despite that zero crack opening and length are considered as the initial conditions , all authors begin their studies from the asymptotic model for the small time . with the assumption of zero leak - off term in the continuity equation and constant @xmath40 ,",
    "the problem is reduced to a self - similar formulation .",
    "the full numerical analysis is then continued by taking the similarity solution as the initial state .",
    "this effectively means that the initial conditions can be replaced by the non - zero crack opening @xmath41    in this paper , the modified formulation of the pkn model is considered , following the recent advance in the area of numerical modelling @xcite .",
    "thus , to trace the fracture front we use the so - called speed equation , instead of the fluid balance relationship : @xmath42 the speed equation assumes that the fracture tip coincides with the fluid front , which excludes the presence of a lag or an invasive zone ahead of the fracture tip .",
    "originally it was introduced by kemp @xcite and has been recently revisited by linkov @xcite .",
    "note that , on substitution of equations , and into , one obtains a relationship between the crack propagation speed and the multiplier of the leading term of the crack opening asymptotic expansion : @xmath43 _ this implies that the quality of the numerical estimation of @xmath44 ( see estimate ( [ as_1 ] ) ) should be vital for the accuracy of computations . _    by substituting the poiseulle equation ( [ poiseulle_1 ] ) into the continuity equation ( [ continuos_1 ] ) one obtains a lubrication ( reynolds ) equation for the considered problem , where the net fluid pressure function @xmath45 is eliminated : @xmath46    in this way the modified formulation of the pkn model includes : i ) the reynolds equation ; ii ) the boundary conditions ",

    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next subsection we present the normalized formulation of the problem .",

    "these solutions are used in section 2 to investigate a numerical algorithm for a time independent variant of the problem . in section 3 ,",
    "the algorithm is modified to tackle the transient regime .",
    "two alternative integral solvers are developed and their performances and applicability are examined .",
    "section 4 contains the final conclusions .",

    "the crack length can be computed from ( [ se_2 ] ) by direct integration to give : @xmath60 which is useful when an implicit method ( for example crank - nicolson scheme ) is utilised ( see @xcite ) .    on substitution of ( [ se_2 ] ) into ( [ stiff_2 ] )",

    "thus , equation ( [ se_2 ] ) transforms to an identity if one takes : @xmath66    on substitution of , , and into the equation ( [ rey ] ) one can reduce the latter to the following ordinary differential equation : @xmath67 with @xmath68 . here , the nonlinear differential operator @xmath69 is defined by the right - hand side of equation ( [ rey ] ) and is equipped with the boundary conditions @xmath70_{\\tilde x=0}=q_0^*,\\quad u(1)=0,\\ ] ] where we have introduced an auxiliary notation : @xmath71 if @xmath72 is constant , then equation ( [ rey1 ] ) together with the boundary conditions ( [ bc_12 ] ) do not depend on time and constitute a boundary value problem ( bvp ) degenerated at point @xmath73 . indeed , the nonlinear coefficient in front of the second order term of the differential operator vanishes at the point @xmath73 in view of the boundary condition ( [ bc_12])@xmath39 .",
    "this bvp is in fact a self - similar formulation of the original problem with specific , given leak - off regime and the inlet flux .",
    "other class of similarity solutions can be found , for some @xmath74 , by assuming : @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77    as a result , one again obtains the bvp ( [ rey1 ] )  ( [ bc_12 ] ) with @xmath78 and @xmath79 thus , for @xmath80 the self - similar solution corresponds to the constant injection flux rate , while the crack propagation speed decreases with time as @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",
    "if , however , one takes @xmath83 , the crack propagation speed is constant and the injection flux rate increases with time : @xmath84 for @xmath82 .",
    "note that self - similar solutions do not necessarily satisfy the initial conditions ( [ ic_11 ] ) as the normalised initial crack lengths are : @xmath85 for the first and the second type , respectively .",
    "as one can see the second type of similarity solution has a physical sense for any @xmath86 and thus , can be used to model three different transient regimes of the crack evolution : crack acceleration ( @xmath87 ) , crack deceleration ( @xmath88 ) , and a steady - state propagation of the fracture ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the first type of solution possesses a physical interpretation only for positive values of @xmath89 , which restricts its application to the cases of accelerating crack .",
    "the self - similar solutions formulated above are used in the following sections to analyse computational accuracy provided by the developed solvers . so far to this end , the asymptotic models have been usually employed @xcite .",
    "however , all of them are restricted to the case of a constant influx , @xmath40 .",

    "indeed , in @xcite for a fluid velocity defined as @xmath262 , a parameter describing its variation along the crack length was introduced : @xmath263\\left[\\int_0 ^ 1v(x , t)dx\\right]^{-1}.\\ ] ] this parameter reflects indirectly the balance between the flux injection rate and leak - off to formation .",
    "it was also shown there that it has a decisive influence on the accuracy of computations ( the greater value of @xmath264 , the greater error of the computations ) .",
    "for the benchmarks with comparable values of @xmath264 , one can expect similar accuracy of the computations .",
    "this trend was also confirmed in @xcite . in our case ,",

    "a pronounced jump of the error is observed at the crack tip , especially for _ solver 2 _ , which explains the deterioration of accuracy when comparing with the finite leak - off case .",
    "however , if one considers the accuracy of the solution away from the crack tip , it is still of the same quality as before .    the same trend can be observed for the temporal derivative of the crack opening , @xmath212 , see fig .",
    "[ blad_dwt_carter ] .",
    "opposite to the benchmark case with the finite leak - off , the distribution of @xmath205 for _ solver 2 _ becomes highly non - uniform , with distinct increase at the crack tip .",
    "this deterioration of the solution accuracy near @xmath73 for the carter leak - off model should not be a surprise , as the algorithm described above in ( [ dm1 ] )  ( [ g_2 ] ) accounted directly only for the first ( leading ) term of the asymptotic expansion for the crack opening .",
    "for the singular leak - off model , the function @xmath102 and other integrands employed in @xmath198 and @xmath199 are not sufficiently smooth near the crack tip , which increases the errors of integration .",
    "however , one can counteract this tendency by accounting for further asymptotic terms in the algorithm , which will be illustrated in the following with the example of two terms of @xmath35 expansion .",
    "let us investigate the evolution of solution errors ( @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 ) in time in the way it was done in fig .",

    "the next terms of asymptotic expansion of the crack opening may be taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , for the carter leak - off model the number of nodal points for which the accuracy saturation is observed is larger than for a finite leak - off .",

    "both new solvers provide better computational accuracy than the conventional algorithms from @xcite .",
