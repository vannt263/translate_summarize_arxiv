    "developed at the same time than morse theory @xcite , lusternik - schnirelmann theory @xcite complements morse theory .",
    "it is used in rather general topological setups and works also in infinite dimensional situations which are used in the calculus of variations . while morse theory is stronger when applicable , lusternik - schnirelmann theory is more flexible and applies in more general situations .",
    "we see here that it comes naturally in graph theory . in order to adapt the lusternik - schnirelmann theorem to graph theory , notions of `` contractibility '' , `` homotopy'',``cup length '' and `` critical points '' must be carried over from the continuum to the discrete .",
    "the first two concepts have been defined by ivashchenko @xcite .",
    "it is related to notions put forward earlier by alexander @xcite and whitehead @xcite ( see @xcite ) . who defined `` simple homotopy '' using `` elementary contractions '' and `` elementary expansions '' or `` subdivisions '' .",
    "we use a simplified but equivalent definition used in @xcite , who noted that edge removal and addition can be realized with pyramid vertex additions and removals .",
    "this is an essential simplification because this allows to describe homotopy contractions using injective functions @xmath14 as @xmath15 .",
    "allowing contractions and expansions together produces homotopy .",
    "functions enter the picture in the same way as in the continuum .",
    "a smooth function @xmath14 on a manifold @xmath16 defines a filtration @xmath17 which for general @xmath18 is a manifold with boundary .",
    "this one parameter family of manifolds crosses homotopy thresholds at critical points of @xmath18 .",
    "this idea can be pushed over to the discrete : any injective function @xmath14 on the vertex set @xmath19 of a graph @xmath1 orders the vertex set @xmath20 and defines so a sequence of graphs @xmath21 generated by the vertices @xmath22 .",
    "analogously to the continuum , this graph filtration @xmath21 gives structure to the graph and builds up any simple graph starting from a single point . while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are often ivashchenko homotopic , there are steps , where the homotopy changes .",
    "quite drastic topological changes can happen at vertices @xmath25 , when the euler characteristic of @xmath26 changes .",
    "this corresponds to the addition of a critical point with nonzero index .",
    "one can however also encounter critical points of zero index which do not necessarily lead to an euler characteristic change .",
    "category can track this .",
    "as in the continuum , homotopy for graphs is an equivalence relation for graphs . it can be seen either directly or as a consequence of the euler - poincar formula , that euler characteristic is a homotopy invariant .",
    "one has also in the discrete to distinguish `` contractibility '' with `` homotopic to a point '' which can be different .",
    "it can be necessary to expand a space first before being able to collapse it to a point .",
    "a first example illustrating this in the discrete was given in @xcite .",
    "we take a definition of contractibility , which is equivalent to the one given by ivashchenko for graphs and which is close to what one can look at in the continuum or simplicial complexes .",
    "a topological space @xmath16 can be called * contractible in itself * , if there is a continuous function @xmath14 on @xmath16 such that @xmath27 are all homotopic or empty .",
    "this implies that @xmath16 is homotopic to a point and shares with the later quantitative topological properties like category or euler characteristic .",
    "of course , this notion does not directly apply in the discrete because for discrete topological spaces , the addition of a discrete point changes the homotopy notion when taken verbatim from the continuum .",
    "the homotopy definition can be adapted however in a meaningful way to graphs , as ivashchenko @xcite has shown .",
    "as in the continuum , it will be important however to distinguish between `` contractibility in itself '' and `` contractibility within a larger graph @xmath3 '' .",
    "+ also the notion of critical points for a continuous function can be deduced from the continuum . for a function which lacks differentiability like a function on a metric space",
    ", we can still define critical points .",
    "to do so , define a point to be a * regular point * if or sufficiently small @xmath28 , the sets @xmath29 are contractible in themselves .",
    "all classically regular points of a differentiable function on a manifold are regular points in this more general sense .",
    "the notion of contractibility allows therefore to define critical points also in nonsmooth situations .",
    "the definition of contractibility for graphs is inductive and as in the continuum , we either can look at contractibility within itself or contractibility of a subgraph within a larger graph .",
    "it will lead to the equivalence relation of homotopy for graphs .",
    "a simple closed curve on a simply connected space @xmath16 for example is contractible in @xmath16 but not contractible in itself nor homotopic to a point .",
    "indeed , the three notions `` contractible in itself '' , `` contractible within a larger graph @xmath3 '' and `` homotopic to a point '' are all different from each other .",
    "seeing the difference is essential also in the continuum .",
    "all three notions are important : `` contractible in itself '' is used to define critical points and simple homotopy steps  , `` contractible within a larger graph @xmath3 '' is used in the definition of category .",
    "`` homotopy '' finally is the frame work which produces natural equivalence classes of graphs .",
    "+ the inductive definition goes as follows : a simple graph @xmath1 is * contractible in itself * if there is an injective function @xmath14 on @xmath19 such that all sub graphs @xmath30 generated by @xmath31 are contractible . only at the global minimum @xmath25 ,",
    "the set @xmath30 is empty .",
    "the * geometric category * @xmath32 of a graph @xmath3 is the smallest number of in itself contractible graphs @xmath33 which cover @xmath1 in the sense @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as in the continuum ,",
    "the geometric category is not a homotopy invariant .",
    "+ contractible sets have euler characteristic @xmath36 and can be built up from a single point by a sequence @xmath37 of graphs which all have the same homotopy properties since @xmath38 is obtained from @xmath39 by a pyramid construction on a contractible subgraph .",
    "examples of properties which are preserved are euler characteristic , cohomology , cup length or category .",
    "these are homotopy invariants as in the continuum .",
    "two graphs @xmath40 are homotopic if one can find a sequence of other graphs @xmath41 such that @xmath42 contracts to @xmath41 or @xmath41 contracts to @xmath42 .",
    "as in the continuum , topological properties like dimension or geometric category are not preserved under homotopy transformations . a graph which is in itself contractible is homotopic to a single point but there are graphs homotopic to a single point which need first to be homotopically enlarged before one can reduce them to a point . these graphs are not contractible .",
    "we should mention that terminology in the continuum often uses `` contractibility '' is a synonym for `` homotopic to a point '' and `` collapsibility '' for homotopies which only use reductions .",
    "we do not think there is a danger of confusions here .",
    "a subgraph @xmath9 of @xmath3 is * contractible in @xmath3 * if it is contractible in itself or if there is a contraction of @xmath3 such that @xmath9 becomes a single point .",
    "any subgraph @xmath9 of a contractible graph @xmath3 is contractible . in the continuum ,",
    "a closed curve in a three sphere is contractible because the sphere is simply connected , but the closed loop is not contractible in itself .",
    "this is the same in the discrete : a closed loop @xmath43 is a subgraph of @xmath44 which is contractible within @xmath44 because @xmath44 can be collapsed to a point , but @xmath43 in itself is not contractible .",
    "the smallest number of * in @xmath3 contractible * subgraphs of @xmath3 whose union covers @xmath3 is called the * topological category * of @xmath3 and denoted @xmath2 .",
    "the minimal @xmath8 among all @xmath9 homotopic to @xmath3 is called * category * and is a homotopy invariant .",
    "we will show that the topological lusternik - schnirelmann category @xmath2 is bounded above by the minimal number @xmath4 of critical points by verifying that for the gradient sequence @xmath21 , topological changes occur at critical points @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , we will see that if @xmath25 is a regular point then the category does not change and consequently that if the category changes ( obviously maximally by one ) , then we have a critical point . from @xmath0 and @xmath46",
    "we get @xmath47 and since the left hand side is a category invariant , we have @xmath48 . +",
    "as mentioned earlier , category theory has morse theory as a brother .",
    "morse theory makes assumptions on functions .",
    "one of them implies that critical points have index @xmath49 or @xmath36 .",
    "the index of critical points has been defined in @xcite .",
    "an euler characteristic change implies that the critical point has nonzero index @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the graph generated by @xmath52 .",
    "the lusternik - schnirelmann theorem @xmath47 bounds the category above by the minimal number @xmath4 of critical points among all injective functions @xmath14 .",
    "it is in the following way related to the poincar - hopf theorem for the graph @xmath53 @xmath54 in both cases , lusternik - schnirelmann as well as poincar - hopf , the left hand side is a homotopy invariant while the right hand side uses notions which are not but which combine to a homotopy invariant .",
    "the lusterik - schnirelmann theorem throws a loser but wider net than euler - poincar because unlike euler characteristic , category can see also `` degenerate '' critical points of zero index .",
    "the analogy can be pushed a bit more : the category difference @xmath55 defines a * category index * of a point and almost by definition , the poincar - hopf type category formula @xmath56 holds .",
    "since the expectation value of the index @xmath57 $ ] is curvature @xcite we can define a category curvature @xmath58 $ ] which is now independent of functions and have a gauss - bonnet type theorem @xmath59 similarly , @xmath60 for some function @xmath61 on the vertices .",
    "+ the analogue , that @xmath62 is bounded above by the number of critical points with nonzero index is the lusternik - schnirelmann theorem @xmath47 . viewed in this way , the lusternik - schnirelmann theorem is also a sibling of a weak morse inequality : if @xmath14 is called a * nondegenerate function * on a graph if @xmath63 or @xmath64 for all critical points @xmath65 and if @xmath4 is the minimal number of critical points a morse function on @xmath3 can have , then @xmath66 . + in order to prove strong morse inequalities , we need to define a morse index at critical points .",
    "this is possible as mentioned in section 5 but requires to look at an even more narrow class of functions for which the betti vector at a critical point should only change at one entry @xmath67 paraphrasing the addition or removal of a @xmath68-dimensional  handle \" .",
    "while morse theory needs assumptions on functions , the lusternik - schnirelmann theorem works for general finite simple graphs .",
    "discrete morse theory has been pioneered in a different way by forman since 1995 ( see e.g. @xcite ) and proven extremely useful .",
    "forman s approach also builds on whitehead and who looks at classes of functions on simplicial complexes for which strong morse inequalities ( and much more ) was proven .",
    "this theory is much more developed than the pure graph theoretical approach persued here .",
    "+ to get the lower bound @xmath6 for category implying @xmath69 , we need a cohomology ring , that is an * exterior multiplication * on * discrete differential forms * and an * exterior derivative*. to get a grassmannian algebra , to define the cup length , a homotopy invariant .",
