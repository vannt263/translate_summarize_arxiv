    "oxygen ions in different ionization stages are abundant in a wide variety of astrophysical objects , including planetary nebulae , stellar atmospheres , seyfert galaxies and the interstellar medium .",
    "in particular , emission lines arising from transitions among the ground state 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath1 levels of can be utilized as a diagnostic tool for determining electron density ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested the use of the emission doublet - line ratio @xmath3@xmath4@xmath5 of arising from nebular transitions from the ground - state levels @xmath6 and @xmath7 to the lowest level @xmath8 as a density indicator . their work combined seaton s newly developed collision theories with osterbrock s access to modern instrumentation to usher in a new era of precision nebular astrophysics ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "osterbrock s observations showed that , in the low - density limit , the observed line ratio was equal to the ratio of statistical weights of the upper levels , as expected from seaton s theories .",
    "the ratio was the main density indicator for nebulae until improvement in detector technology made the red lines accessible .",
    "when both nebular and auroral transitions ( at 7720 and 7730 ) are considered , both @xmath2 and the electron temperature @xmath9 of the plasma may simultaneously be found , as shown by for example @xcite .    to calculate reliable line ratios",
    ", one must employ highly accurate atomic data , especially for electron impact excitation rates and transition probabilities for the forbidden lines . until the last decade",
    ", the most reliable excitation rates for transitions among the 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath1 levels of have been those of @xcite , obtained by employing the r - matrix method with inclusion of the five energetically lowest @xmath10 states , 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath1 @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and 1s@xmath02s2p@xmath14 @xmath15 , @xmath12 .",
    "although the calculation was performed in the non - relativistic approach , the data for the excitation of the fine - structure levels 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath1 @xmath7 , @xmath6 from the ground state @xmath8 were customarily obtained by splitting the non - relativistic values of the excitation rates @xmath16 proportionally to the statistical weights of the final levels , the scaling originally suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite have recalculated excitation rates for using the r - matrix method within the breit - pauli approximation , where the 11 fine - structure levels were included explicitly into a close - coupling formulation of the scattering problem .",
    "their data are significantly different from those of @xcite , and the differences were attributed to the larger number of states included and a better resolution of the resonance structure in the calculation of mclaughlin & bell .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used these newly calculated electron impact excitation rates in their model to calculate the emission - line ratio diagrams for lines of for a range of @xmath9 and @xmath2 appropriate to gaseous nebulae .",
    "more recently , @xcite compared density estimates for planetary nebulae based on different density - indicator lines of , , , , and .",
    "they found systematic deviations for values of @xmath2 derived from the lines , and attributed these to errors in the atomic data , particularly the collision strengths used by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have considered four density indicators , including the [ ] @xmath17 doublet ratio , for a large sample of more than 100 planetary nebulae , and concluded that the calculations of collision strengths by @xcite are inconsistent with the observations .",
    "very recently , @xcite have investigated relativistic and correlation effects in electron - impact excitation of using the breit - pauli r - matrix method .",
    "they concluded that the fine - structure collision strengths are not affected by relativistic effects and do not significantly depart from the values obtained from a @xmath18 transformation .",
    "@xcite discussed the astrophysical implications of these new atomic data and have derived the line ratios @xmath19 .",
    "their results confirmed analyses of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "in our work we study electron - impact excitation of forbidden lines in using the r - matrix approach in the breit - pauli framework .",
    "we attempt to establish if relativistic effects and a sufficient resolution of the resonance structure in the collision strengths can cause the significant departure from the statistical - weights ratio for the maxwellian - averaged effective collision strengths @xmath16 , as was claimed in @xcite .",
    "two different sets of configuration basis are employed to describe the target states , in order to evaluate the influence of the number of states included in the scattering problem on the collision strength parameters .",
    "furthermore , we use two different types of radial orbitals , namely those obtained using thomas - fermi - dirac model potential and slater - type orbitals , in our scattering calculation .",

    "t07_. in addition , we include data from @xcite , denoted as _ mb98 _ , for comparison in the last column of table  [ tab : compare ] .",
    "there are two main differences between our calculation and that of @xcite : ( i ) they used a smaller ci expansion of the target , 6 configurations compared to our 22 ; ( ii ) their 3p and 3d radial functions were real physical orbitals , whereas ours are correlation orbitals optimized to improve the representation of the 2s@xmath02p@xmath1 and 2s2p@xmath14 levels .",
    "when comparing our results obtained using the experimental target energies but different sets of configuration expansion and different radial orbitals , we can see that the values for @xmath16 show no substantial differences .",

    "there are minor differencies in the effective collision strengths for the @xmath0d@xmath30d@xmath29 transition at very low electron temperatures , but this becomes negligible for @xmath31  k.    for the results obtained using the _ ab initio _",
    "target levels energies , the situation is quite different .",
    "there are noticeable discrepancies in the values of @xmath16 for the different configuration expansion sets and different radial orbitals .",
    "this is particularly true for @xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath33 , @xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath29 and @xmath0d@xmath30d@xmath29 , and for low electron temperatures .",
    "there is much better agreement at higher temperatures for these transitions as well as for @xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath29 and @xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath34 , where the discrepancies in @xmath16 are very small at all temperatures .",
    "results obtained using the theoretical target level energies are generally consistent , and agree with the data obtained using the experimental target energies .",
    "difference are due to the resonances positioned very close to the excitation threshold .",
    "their position depends on the type of radial orbitals used and on the ci expansion applied ( see table  [ tab : target ] ) .    for illustrative purposes , we present a plot of the near - threshold collision strengths @xmath25 for @xmath0d@xmath33 ",
    "@xmath0d@xmath29 obtained within the _ sto1 _",
    "set , using both the experimental ( solid line ) and the theoretical ( dashed line ) target level energies in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega23 ] .",
    "it is clear that the first resonance structure is located right on the edge of the excitation threshold , at 0.26519  ry ( see table  [ tab : target ] ) in the case of the theoretical target energies .",
    "however , the same resonance structure is shifted away from the threshold by more than 0.01  ry when energy adjustments are introduced . even if the background value of collision strength does not depend on the type of target energies used ( as may be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : omega23 ] ) , the low electron temperature behaviour of the effective collision strength @xmath16 is defined by the near - threshold resonances and their positions .    when the electron temperature increases , the low - energy part of the collision strength @xmath25 becomes less important in the overall value of @xmath16 , and the agreement of the different sets of effective collision strengths @xmath16 becomes significantly better .",
    "this points to the fact that collision strength background values are essentially the same both for the experimental and theoretical target level energies .",
    "hence , introducing the target - energy adjustments changes only the positions of resonances .",
    "therefore , these adjustments can not lead to substantial deviations for the calculated effective collision strengths , especially at the higher electron temperatures .    a comparison with the breit - pauli results ( _ bprm06 _ ) of @xcite and @xcite indicates reasonable agreement , although our @xmath16 values are consistently smaller than their values . for the transition @xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath33 ,",
    "the difference is @xmath35 , for @xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath29 is @xmath36 , for @xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath29 is around @xmath37 and for @xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath34 is @xmath38 .",
    "these discrepancies are caused by the different background values of the corresponding collision strengths @xmath25 , arising from the different configuration expansion sets used in our calculation and in those of @xcite .",
    "a slightly more complicated situation is observed for @xmath0d@xmath30d@xmath29 , where the discrepancy in @xmath16 is @xmath39 at @xmath40  k , which falls to just @xmath41 at @xmath42  k. we can attribute the larger discrepancy of the low temperature results to differences in the resonance structure of the collision strengths positioned right on the excitation threshold of this transition , which is noticeable in fig .  1 from @xcite",
    ". the discrepancies at higher temperatures are for the same reason as for the transitions originating from the ground level 2s@xmath02p@xmath1 @xmath14s@xmath43 .",
    "a similar pattern can be observed for transitions originating from the levels @xmath0d@xmath33 and @xmath0d@xmath29 , where differences in the calculated values of @xmath16 remain approximately constant , and are largely due to the differing background values .",
    "when we compare effective collision strength ratios for the transitions originating from the ground level @xmath14s@xmath29 , we see that they are very close to the ratios of the statistical weights of the upper levels . at @xmath44",
    "k , the ratio @xmath16(@xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath33)/ @xmath16(@xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath29 ) is 1.505 in our calculation and 1.509 in that of @xcite , while the ratio @xmath16(@xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath29)/ @xmath16(@xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath34 ) is 1.94 and 2.06 , respectively .",
    "although for transitions originating from @xmath0d@xmath33 and @xmath0d@xmath29 to @xmath0p@xmath29 and @xmath0p@xmath34 , the ratio of @xmath16 does not correspond to the ratio of the upper level statistical weights , it is approximately the same both in our calculation and in that of _",
    "bprm06_.    a comparison with data of @xcite presented in the column _ t07 _ of table  [ tab : compare ] indicates very good agreement . for the transitions @xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath33 , @xmath0d@xmath29",
    ", the differences in @xmath16 values do not exceed few percent , with our results being slightly higher .",
    "for the transitions to the levels @xmath0p@xmath29 and @xmath0p@xmath34 our calculated effective collision strengths are slightly smaller than those of @xcite .",
    "a similar pattern is observed for the forbidden transitions not only from the ground level but also from the excited levels of the multiplets @xmath0d and @xmath0p .",
    "however , we note that the results for the excitation to the levels @xmath0p@xmath29 and @xmath0p@xmath34 in table 3 of @xcite should be swapped to obtain the correct data .",
    "this was probably due to the fact that the energy ordering for the corresponding calculated levels differs from the experimental one .",
    "the effective collision strengths for the transition @xmath0d@xmath30d@xmath29 differ significantly , the deviation reaching some @xmath45 at the lower temperature end .",
    "it should be noted that the differences are smaller when the theoretical level energies are employed in our calculations , suggesting that the main reason for this disagreement is that we use experimental level energies in our scattering calculation leading to more accurate data .",
    "this is particularly important for the transition @xmath0d@xmath30d@xmath29 because of resonance structures present very close to the excitation threshold ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : omega23 ] ) .",
    "a comparison of our data ( from the _ tfd _ set ) with the breit - pauli calculations of @xcite reveals two different trends .",
    "for some transitions , namely @xmath14s@xmath32d@xmath33 and @xmath14s@xmath32p@xmath29 , the agreement is exceptionally good , even better than the @xcite data .",
    "this is due to the similar target and wavefunction ci expansion used . for @xmath0d@xmath30d@xmath29 ,",
    "the effective collision strengths agree very well at higher electron temperatures , whereas some difference appears at @xmath46  k , which can be attributed to the effect of the near - threshold resonances .    for other transitions from the ground state , shown in table  [ tab :",
    "compare ] , there are very significant discrepancies between our effective collision strengths and those of @xcite .",
    "the data differ by nearly 30% for excitation to the @xmath0d@xmath29 level and by 1520% for the @xmath0p@xmath34 level .",
    "it is worth noting that both of these are the upper levels of their corresponding terms , @xmath0d or @xmath0p , respectively .",
    "such a large drop in the value of the effective collision strength @xmath16 causes the significant deviation from the statistical weights ratio , which is not expected for a singly - ionized ion with @xmath47 .",
    "mclaughlin & bell explain this effect by the influence of configuration mixing , but there are no data presented in their work to confirm such a conclusion .    checking our ci wavefunction expansion coefficients for the fine - structure levels of the 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath1 configuration , we do not find any substantial configuration mixing effects which can cause this kind of deviation .",
    "the main contributing term is usually more than 0.95 for levels with @xmath48 and approximately 0.99 for levels with @xmath49 .",
    "these appear to be very reasonable values for a low - z ion .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the data of @xcite for some transitions are incorrect . although we can not define any particular reason for the inaccuracy of their data , the most plausible cause is a limited ci expansion of the target wavefunctions , where an incomplete set of csfs is used .",
    "in the current work we have determined the collision strengths @xmath25 and the effective collisions strengths @xmath16 for a wide range of electron temperatures @xmath50 using the relativistic breit - pauli r - matrix code for the excitation of forbidden lines among the fine - structure levels of the ground configuration 1s@xmath02s@xmath02p@xmath1 of the o@xmath51 ion .",
    "the collision strengths are calculated using a very fine energy mesh , which allows the delineation of all resonance structure to high accuracy .",
    "a comparison of the effective collision strengths obtained using different energy meshes confirms that a convergence of @xmath25 on the energy mesh was achieved .",
    "the collision strengths are computed using various target wavefunction expansions and different sets of the radial orbitals , employing both _",
    "ab initio _ theoretical and the experimental energies for the target levels . in all cases",
    "we do not detect any sizeable difference in the background value of the calculated @xmath25 .    in all six datasets for our calculations",
    ", we do not find any significant departure from the statistical distribution for the ratio of the collision strengths @xmath25 and the effective collision strengths @xmath16 .",
    "this confirms the findings of @xcite , and shows that the results of @xcite for some transitions are inaccurate .",
    "although we have tried to replicate the latter calculation and establish the origin of the departure of their results from the statistical weight rule , we did not find any reason why it could happen .",
    "consequently , any analysis of observations based on the atomic data from @xcite must be treated with caution .",
    "the differences between our results and those of @xcite and @xcite can be attributed to the more extensive and converged ci expansion used here and we therefore consider the results given in table  [ tab : upstfd ] to be the best available for this ion at present .",
