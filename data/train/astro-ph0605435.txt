    "molecular cloud complexes ( mccs ) in the galaxy show an abundance of internal structure , both in density and velocity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the density contrasts are non - linear  independent of the importance of gravity @xcite  , and the mccs exhibit non - thermal line - widths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , generally interpreted as supersonic turbulence .",
    "filaments seem to dominate the morphologies in ( column ) density and velocity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of densities and velocities is consistent with a turbulent spectrum , the details of which are a matter of debate , though @xcite .    extremely puzzling",
    "is the source of this wealth of structure .",
    "while stellar feedback certainly is a powerful driver ( see e.g. @xcite ) , it only acts locally , and definitely only after the first stars have formed within the cloud .",
    "moreover , stellar driving might be difficult to reconcile with the observed , nearly self - similar spatial energy distribution .",
    "external drivers suffer from the fact that the cold dense gas essentially acts like a wall to any incoming wave ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , preventing an efficient energy transfer from the warm diffuse component to the cold dense phase ( see , however , @xcite for 1d models ) .",
    "@xcite argue that openings ( holes , channels ) in a mcc serve as an inroad for alfvn - waves , however , the question of what forms these channels remains .    with growing evidence that the lifetimes of molecular clouds  at least in the solar neighborhood  range around a few ( @xmath1 to @xmath2 ) myrs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a picture in which mccs are envisaged as transient objects in large - scale atomic colliding flows rather than as well - defined entities in a quasi - equilibrium state ( giant molecular cloud , gmc ) is emerging .",
    "the colliding flows would accumulate atomic gas which might eventually reach column densities high enough for h@xmath0-formation  at which point the `` lifetime '' of the molecular cloud would start , i.e. the accumulation time could be much longer .",
    "some of the molecular regions might become self - gravitating and form stars instantaneously ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large - scale flows might be driven by supernova explosions , galactic shear , or might occur in galaxy interactions ( for recent evidence of cloud collisions , see @xcite ) .",
    "we propose and extend the idea ( see  [ s : prevcurwork ] ) that the structures observed in mccs arise from the very processes that form mccs , i.e. they arise without recourse to non - linear perturbations put in by hand , an approach which defers the problem to an even earlier stage .",
    "we investigate numerically the formation of structure in mcc precursors via colliding flows . to avoid the somewhat unwieldy `` precursor of molecular cloud complexes '' , we will abbreviate this to _ pomcloc_s . by this",
    "we mean cold clouds ( usually identified as cold neutral medium , cnm ) , which may be fully atomic or may already contain traces of h@xmath0 . in any case",
    ", the pomclocs serve as the initial stage of molecular cloud complexes , mccs .",
    "our numerical models emphasize the ease with which colliding flows generate structure via a combination of dynamical and thermal instabilities . due to the thermal instability",
    ", structure grows predominantly on small scales , leading to early non - linear density perturbations as possible seeds of gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "the resulting line - widths in the cold gas when seen in projection agree with observed values , however , the cold gas does not seem to exhibit internal supersonic turbulence .",
    "only a few percent of the energy input remains available for driving turbulent motions in the cold gas , the bulk of the energy is lost due to radiative cooling . within the scope of the models , we find that the time scale for h@xmath0 formation is limited not by a minimum temperature , but by the highly unsteady environment .",
    "this work extends our previous study @xcite , in dimensions ( here , we present corresponding 3d models ) , in resolution and in scope of physical applications .",
    "of course , we rely heavily on earlier work (  [ s : prevcurwork ] ) .",
    "the physics of the problem is described in  [ s : physics ] , and the numerical realization as well as numerical artifacts are discussed in  [ s : numerics ] and  [ ss : effectbounds ] , in order to provide a background for the interpretation of the results (  [ s : results ] ) .",
    "these are summarized in  [",
    "s : summary ] , while ",
    "[ s : wheretogo ] suggests possible routes to follow in the future .",
    "the concept behind this study is that molecular cloud formation should be seen as a non - equilibrium process . when the perception of the ism as a dynamical medium gained acceptance , many aspects of molecular cloud and star formation theory were revisited . @xcite and @xcite re - examined the jeans criteria and found that converging velocity fields could provoke the gravitational collapse of sub - jeans mass gas clouds .",
    "@xcite followed this line of thought , further emphasizing that diffuse gas cooling upon compression by even mild velocity and pressure disturbances could easily be transformed to high densities .",
    "they applied this idea to externally perturbed spherical clouds .",
    "motivated by these investigations into the role of compressive velocity fields in promoting fast cooling and gravitational collapse , @xcite used two - dimensional numerical simulations to study the cooling and fragmentation of gas compressed at the interface of two identical , oppositely directed supersonic colliding gas streams .    since these early works which explored some consequences of a dynamical ism , molecular cloud formation and evolution has been studied within the framework of compressible turbulence . a strongly fluctuating medium with motions on many scales results in high density albeit transient regions which might be identified as molecular clouds .",
    "large - scale ( kiloparsec ) models of molecular cloud formation were presented in two - dimensional simulations by @xcite and @xcite , throwing light on the role of turbulence in the cycle of cloud and star formation @xcite , and specifying conditions for cloud formation in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "but the numerical resolution needed to yield a detailed explanation of the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds makes it necessary to tackle the problem with smaller - scale simulations ( tens of parsecs ) .",
    "for instance , the role played by thermal instability continues to be actively explored .",
    "this instability alone has been shown to be an efficient mechanism for generating substructure and even driving turbulence @xcite .",
    "as indicated by earlier work ( e.g. @xcite in an application to the solar atmosphere ) , thermal instability can be triggered by compression .",
    "indeed one - dimensional plane - parallel simulations of transonic converging flows @xcite show how this mechanism transforms inflowing diffuse atomic gas to dense cold gas that is long - lived .",
    "shock waves ( driven e.g. by supernova explosions , @xcite ; @xcite ) are another means to create cold , dense gas from warm , diffuse gas . propagating into the warm ism , shock waves have been shown to fragment in the presence of thermal instability @xcite and linear perturbations @xcite leading to h@xmath0-formation within a few myrs @xcite .",
    "however the passage of a single shock might not leave in its wake enough dense , cold , cloudlets to constitute a mcc .",
    "encounters between streams of transsonically transported gas , on the other hand might be a way to collect , compress , and cool large quantities of gas while at the same time possibly endowing the cold , dense gas with the dynamical and structural characteristics of molecular cloud complexes .",
    "this scenario has recently come into the spotlight .    in high - resolution two - dimensional simulations of supersonic , colliding gas flows ,",
    "@xcite confirm that even in a very dynamical environment a bistable medium develops as compressions initiate thermal instability .",
    "however their study concentrates on how turbulence generates and influences thermally unstable gas , not on the reverse problem of how thermal instability could feed the turbulence characteristic of molecular clouds . in three - dimensional simulations of transonic colliding flows ,",
    "@xcite show that a thin cold sheet , reminiscent of those observed by @xcite and @xcite forms at the junction of the two flows .",
    "it develops turbulence which they attribute to the non - linear thin shell instability ( ntsi , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore they find that even in simulations without gravity , the highest density gas is overpressured with respect to the mean warm neutral medium pressure , suggesting that the ram pressure of the colliding flows is responsible .    to be fair , we should mention that favorable conditions for molecular cloud formation not only exist in converging flows , but also in `` focal planes '' of ( sustained ) mhd - waves , as @xcite shows .",
    "however , he notes that while highly structured mccs form in such a system , the cold gas does not acquire significant turbulence .",
    "the notion of generating the turbulent substructure of molecular clouds by their formation process has been discussed in various contexts ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite emphasized the evolution of the thermal states in the colliding flows , and provided a semi - analytical model for the evolution of a gas parcel .",
    "one of the main differences to the present study is that they impose velocity perturbations on their incoming gas flow  as do @xcite , although as `` random noise '' at a percent - level  , whereas we defer the structure generation to the actual flow collision site .",
    "@xcite compared in detail analytical solutions with one - dimensional and three - dimensional models . @xcite and their subsequent work discuss molecular cloud formation behind a shock - compressed layer , more resembling the situation of an expanding shell . in their case ,",
    "the initial perturbations reside in the density field .",
    "the present study extends the `` proof of concept '' of `` structure formation from scratch '' in two dimensions presented in @xcite by focusing on the dynamical state and the turbulent properties of the pomcloc during its formation , and on the conditions necessary for the onset of h@xmath0 formation .",
    "we restrict the models to hydrodynamics with radiative cooling , leaving out the effects of gravity and magnetic fields .",
    "gravity would lead to further fragmentation , and magnetic fields could have a stabilizing effect ( see also discussion in  [ s : wheretogo ] ) .",
    "for this regime , then , we identify three relevant instabilities , namely the ntsi , the kelvin - helmholtz - instability ( khi ) and the thermal instability ( ti ) .",
    "this enumeration of course does not mean that the instabilities work independently of each other .",
    "rather , the resulting dynamical system is a consequence of a combination of all three instabilities , however , in degrees depending on the local flow properties .      the ntsi ( @xcite , fig .  [",
    "f : ntsisketch ] ) arises in a shock - bounded slab , when ripples in a two - dimensional slab focus incoming shocked material and produce density fluctuations .",
    "gas streaming along the @xmath3-direction will be deflected at perturbation peaks and collect in the troughs .",
    "thus , @xmath3-momentum is transported laterally ( along the @xmath4-direction ) . for a weak equation of state , the slab can act as a wall to deflect the incoming gas streams , while for an adiabatic one , the bounding shocks will travel faster at the @xmath4-locations of the troughs because of the higher compression , thus leveling out the initial perturbations ( see @xcite for a discussion of the speed of the bounding shock ) .",
    "the growth rate is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the sound speed , @xmath7 is the wave number along the slab , and @xmath8 is the amplitude of the spatial perturbation of the slab .    various aspects of the ntsi have been investigated numerically . @xcite and @xcite focused on the combination of the ntsi and self - gravity .",
    "the former authors found a criterion for forming self - gravitating fragments either under isothermal conditions or with line - cooling .",
    "@xcite discussed the effect of the cooling strength on the evolution of the ntsi , stating that strong cooling leads to small - scale fragmentation which wipes out the ntsi - effects .",
    "@xcite investigated vishniac s analysis numerically , noting that the shear flows along the slab lead to kelvin - helmholtz modes and identifying them as the main cause for the internal structure of the slab .",
    "although in their radiative shock study , @xcite focused mainly on the interaction of stellar winds , they extended the argument and the implications to the more general interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the ntsi in the context of cloud collisions , applying the process to the formation of clumpy filaments in e.g. the orion molecular cloud .",
    "they partially included magnetic fields , following the magnetic pressure term and the induction equation , but leaving out the tension term of the lorentz - force .",
    "the flows deflected at the slab ( as indicated in fig .",
    "[ f : ntsisketch ] ) can cause shear instability modes , which have been studied at great length ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , to name a few ) . in the incompressible case , for a step function profile in the velocity and constant densities across the shear layer , the growth rate is given by the velocity difference @xmath9 , i.e. all wave modes get unstable .",
    "if aligned with the flow , magnetic fields can stabilize against the khi via the tension component of the lorentz force , and the growth rate is given by @xmath10 , i.e the modes that will get unstable are those for which the flow velocity difference is larger than the alfvn speed @xmath11 . for compressible gas",
    ", the situation changes substantially : the system will be stable for all those wave numbers whose effective mach number is larger than a critical value @xcite .",
    "thus , while kelvin - helmholtz modes definitely _ will _ play a role in the suggested scenario , figure  [ f : ntsisketch ] certainly can give only a very simplified picture .",
    "the ti @xcite rests on the balancing of heating and cooling processes in the ism .",
    "the ti develops an isobaric condensation mode and an acoustic mode , which  under ism - conditions  is mostly damped .",
    "the condensation mode s growth rate is independent of the wave length , however , since it is an isobaric mode , smaller perturbations will grow first @xcite .",
    "heat conduction sets the smallest growth scale .",
    "if this scale is not resolved numerically , perturbations will grow at the resolution scale @xcite .",
    "the signatures of the ti are fragmentation and clumping .",
    "they persist as long as the sound crossing time across a density perturbation is smaller than the cooling time scale @xmath12 the ti can drive turbulence in an otherwise quiescent medium , even continuously , if an episodic heating source is available @xcite .",
    "all three instabilities grow fastest or at least first on the smallest scales .",
    "this poses a dire challenge for the numerical method .",
    "we chose a method based on the 2nd order bhatnagar - gross - krook formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , allowing control of viscosity and heat conduction .",
    "the code evolves the navier - stokes equations in their conservative form to second order in time and space .",
    "the hydrodynamical quantities are updated in time unsplit form .",
    "as shown below , statistical properties of the models are resolved with respect to grid resolution , viscosity and heat conduction , although the flow patterns change in detail  as is expected in a turbulent environment .",
    "the heating and cooling rates are restricted to optically thin atomic lines following @xcite , so that we are able to study the precursors of mccs up to the point when they could form h@xmath0 .",
    "dust extinction becomes important above column densities of @xmath13@xmath14 , which are reached only in the densest regions modeled .",
    "thus , we use the unattenuated uv radiation field for grain heating @xcite , expecting substantial uncertainties in cooling rates only for the densest regions . the ionization degree is derived from a balance between ionization by cosmic rays and recombination , assuming that ly @xmath15 photons are directly reabsorbed .",
    "numerically , heating and cooling is implemented iteratively as a source term for the internal energy @xmath16 of the form @xmath17 in units of energy per volume per second . here",
    ", @xmath18 is the heating contribution ( mainly photo - electric heating from grains ) , @xmath19 the cooling contribution ( mainly due to the cii hfs line at @xmath20 m ) .",
    "since the cooling and heating prescription has to be added outside the flux computations , it lowers the time order of the scheme . to speed up the calculations , equation  ( [ e : cooling ] )",
    "is tabulated on a @xmath21 grid in density and temperature .",
    "for each cell and iteration , the actual energy change is then bilinearly interpolated from this grid .",
    "two opposing , uniform , identical flows in the @xmath3-@xmath4 computational plane initially collide head - on at a sinusoidal interface with wave number @xmath22 ( and @xmath23 for 3d models ) and amplitude @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ f : ntsisketch ] ) .",
    "the incoming flows are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the system is thermally unstable for densities @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "the cooling curve covers a density range of @xmath26 @xmath25 and a temperature range of @xmath27 k. the box side length is @xmath28pc .",
    "thus , coriolis forces from galactic rotation are negligible , however , the simulation domain is large enough to accommodate a moderately - sized molecular cloud complex . for an interface with @xmath29 , a cold high - density slab devoid of inner structure forms .",
    "the onset of the dynamical instabilities thus can be controlled by varying the amplitude of the interface perturbation .",
    "this allows us to test turbulence generation under minimally favorable conditions .",
    "this setup might seem artificial : ( 1 ) the incoming flows are not expected to be perfectly uniform , however , we chose to defer the moment of structure generation to the last possible moment in the simulation , instead of imposing perturbations on the incoming flows ( see  [ ss : asymmetries ] ) .",
    "( 2 ) as we will see below , the model run times extend considerably beyond @xmath30myrs . at an inflow speed of @xmath30",
    "km s@xmath31 this would correspond to a total extent of the system of @xmath32pc .",
    "this suggests that the initial densities of the flows are more likely to be a few @xmath25 to form molecular clouds with flows of order @xmath33-@xmath34 pc length .",
    "spiral density waves can also produce coherent flows of the length required , at least in principle .",
    "the boundary conditions in the transverse ( i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath35 ) directions are periodic , while in the @xmath3-direction , the boundary values are defined as uniform inflow at constant density @xmath36 and inflow speed @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the boundaries can not treat outgoing waves or flows .",
    "thus , the models have to be halted once the bounding shocks reach the boundaries .",
    "the corresponding time scales have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "sketch of the ntsi mechanism and geometry of the initial conditions .",
    "gas is streaming along the @xmath3-direction and colliding at the perturbed interface .",
    "the resulting shear flows excite kh - modes . ]    to facilitate the analysis of the dynamics and time history of the cold gas , the code is equipped with lagrangian tracer particles , that are advected after each flux update .",
    "tracer particles are deployed at grid cell centers where @xmath38k and in four generations , starting at approximately @xmath39 myrs in intervals of @xmath40 myrs .",
    "this allows us to study the effect of turbulent motions on the fluid parcels as well as the time history of ( representative ) regions of cold gas . extending the model sequence of @xcite",

    "we will restrict the numerical discussion to the 2d models , since similar effects pertain to the 3d models .",
    "figure  [ f : prettypic ] shows stills of models 2c10c , 2c20c and 2c30c ( i.e. a sequence in mach numbers 1 , 2 and 3 ) taken @xmath62 myrs after flow contact time .",
    "while model 2c10c preserves the symmetry of the initial conditions , at larger mach numbers , the structures develop strong asymmetrical features with respect to the mid - plane .        since this could be cause for concern , we measured the degree of asymmetry in the models with time ( fig .",
    "[ f : asymmetry ] ) .",
    "asymmetry is defined in terms of the density differences as @xmath63 where the average is over all cells with @xmath64 ( and not over the whole domain in order to exclude the inflow initial conditions which are symmetric ) , and @xmath65 is the absolute value of the density difference between cells which should be symmetric across the upper and lower half of the simulation midplane .",
    "the initial conditions are perfectly symmetric , but slight differences at the machine accuracy level in the reconstruction of hydrodynamical variables eventually lead to a difference in the cooling strength and thus cause perceptible asymmetries .",
    "the code preserves perfect symmetry for a purely adiabatic equation of state ( i.e. without the additional heating and cooling terms ) .",
    "after onset , the asymmetries grow linearly in time until they reach a saturation level between @xmath66 and @xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds approximately to the temperature ( and density ) contrast between the warm and cold gas and thus to the maximum asymmetry reachable for the system .",
    "although the asymmetries increase with mach number and  to a lesser extent  with resolution , they only appear well after the system has evolved .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite chose an alternative route : they added perturbations ( in density or velocity ) to the incoming flow , thus breaking the symmetry of the initial conditions .",
    "while the physical reason for adding perturbations to the inflow is perfectly obvious , in the present study we want to emphasize the point that even with the least possible perturbation to the flow , ( turbulent ) substructures are generated with ease . in some sense , this is an attempt to carry the argument to extremes .",
    "conversely , one could argue that imposing perturbations on the incoming flow helps to hide the symmetry breaking due to truncation errors . to get a stronger handle on how our somewhat extreme initial conditions are affecting the results , we repeated model 2c20 twice , once with an interface perturbation mode of @xmath67 instead of @xmath22 , and in the second repetition with the @xmath67-mode overlaid on the @xmath22 mode at @xmath68% of the amplitude at @xmath22 , motivated by a turbulent cascade . in both cases ,",
    "the system develops small - scale structures at @xmath67 , meaning that the instability grows at the smallest imposed ( @xmath67 ) scales , as long as these are larger than the field length ( see next section ) .",
    "@xcite demonstrated with 1d models that the choice of the heat conductivity @xmath69 can strongly influence the dynamics of the system . especially they argue that a too low heat conductivity can damp turbulent motions in the cold phase and can lead to artificial fragmentation at the grid scale ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "the critical parameter here is the field length @xcite  the length scale below which heat conduction can stabilize the ti ",

    "@xcite conclude that for ism - conditions , a linear resolution of several thousand cells is needed ( they get convergence at @xmath73 cells ) .",
    "the heat conduction in the bgk scheme can be controlled explicitly ( see @xcite for an analysis ) by varying the kinematic viscosity , since the prandtl number in the code is @xmath74 by construction .",
    "the choice of the viscosity is controlled by two considerations , namely ( a ) it should be large enough to prevent numerical artifacts on small scales , and ( b ) it should be small enough to leave enough dynamical range . obviously , both requirements are difficult to meet simultaneously .    to establish to what degree our models are resolved , we begin by measuring the field lengths ( eq .

    "the inset numbers give the average number of cold regions per line of sight , i.e. normalized to resolution .",

    "molecular clouds consistently show non - thermal line - widths of a few km s@xmath31 ( e.g. @xcite ) that  together with temperatures of @xmath86k  are generally interpreted as supersonic turbulence .",

    "the `` observed '' linewidth is derived from the histogram of the density - weighted line - of - sight velocity dispersion in the cold gas at @xmath38k ( fig .",

    "this linewidth would correspond to linewidths in the cold neutral medium as e.g. traced by hi .",
    "since the _ internal _ line - widths of coherent cold regions ( open symbols ) range around the sound speed of the cold gas ( @xmath89 km s@xmath31 ) , the _ internal _ velocity dispersions do not reach mach numbers @xmath90 ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the `` supersonic '' line - widths are a consequence of cold regions moving with respect to each other within a warmer and more diffuse medium , but not a result of internal supersonic turbulence in the cold gas which eventually would be hosting star formation @xcite .",
    "note from figure  [ f : veldis_dens_obsint ] , that this result is independent of resolution and geometry .",

    "the time scales give a lower limit , i.e. denote the point at which the first h@xmath0 could potentially be formed .",
    "since the cooling curve only extends down to @xmath77k anyway , we can not make more detailed statements about h@xmath0 formation . from figure",
    "[ f : massfrac ] we already saw that for reasonable inflow speeds , a few @xmath137 pc@xmath31 at @xmath38k accumulate within approximately @xmath138 myrs . this material would be in principle available for h@xmath0 formation  at least as far as the temperature is concerned .",
    "\\(2 ) the ( now cold ) gas has to stay cold `` long '' enough to allow for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "time estimates for h@xmath0 formation vary . in their analysis of h@xmath0 formation behind shock fronts ,",
    "@xcite quote time scales between @xmath39 and @xmath30 myrs , depending on the inflow momentum .",
    "once h@xmath0 exists , its further formation could well be a run - away process , since self - shielding is much more efficient than dust shielding .",
    "this means that the critical time scale is given by the onset of h@xmath0 formation .",
    "a minimum requirement therefore is that the cold gas is not re - heated during this time scale . to measure this",

    "apart from a small fraction at short time intervals @xmath139 ( these are particles at the rims of the cold regions ) , most of the particles stay cold for at least @xmath121 myrs .",

    "molecular clouds in our galaxy are complex and highly - structured , with broad , non - thermal line - widths suggesting substantial turbulent motions .",
    "thus , molecular clouds very likely are not static entities and might not necessarily be in an equilibrium state , but their properties could well be determined by their formation process .",

    "the open boundaries are implemented via a constant extrapolation of the last active cells , so that the pressure gradient at the boundary in the transverse direction is constant .",
    "however because for models l2c20 and l2c30 we implement an `` inactive '' region above and below the inflow region , the gas in the dense compressed region , i.e. the inflow region , sees a pressure gradient along the transverse direction at the boundaries between the `` active '' and `` inactive '' regions .    for models l2c20 and l2c30",

    "only model l2c20 shows some deviation from a linear evolution at later times .",

    "however , this would only refer to motions of the cold gas regions with respect to each other , but not necessarily to internal motions in the cold gas .",

    "@xmath152 @xmath14 . thus",
    ", molecular clouds might preferentially form in flows where the ambient atomic density is higher than the average density , i.e. @xmath153 @xmath25 , @xmath154 km s@xmath31 . then , the mechanism described above might well dominate the formation of low - mass molecular clouds .",
    "more massive objects need either more time or a different parameter regime as in e.g. galaxy mergers .",
    "( 2 ) the models presented here do not account for gravity .",
    "since a slab - like geometry is favored by construction in the colliding flow scenario , gravity would lead to collapse in the plane , causing the densities ( and column densities ) needed for shielding to be rapidly reached . in that sense ,",
    "any time scales given for conditions favorable for h@xmath0 formation are upper estimates .",
    "note that the _ lateral _ collapse can set in much later , and , if the cloud is large enough , and sufficiently dense substructures exist , might only occur after stars have formed locally .",
    "we would like to stress the point that since the presented models are concerned with the formation of precursors of molecular clouds , the somewhat largish assembly time scales do not constitute a problem for short molecular cloud lifetimes .",
    "as @xcite discussed , the ratio of the precursor s assembly time scale over the actual molecular cloud lifetime can be as large as the relative amounts of atomic over molecular gas ( approximately a factor of @xmath155 in the solar neighborhood , @xcite ) . for a molecular cloud life time of , say , @xmath2myrs in the solar neighborhood ( @xcite and references therein ) , the accumulation time for the pomcloc",
    "would be expected to range around @xmath156myrs .",
    "obviously , the _ molecular cloud _ lifetime starts only once molecules are being formed .",
    "our models generally run longer than @xmath30 myrs . at an inflow velocity of @xmath30 km",
    "s@xmath31 , this corresponds to a coherent flow of approximately @xmath34pc , or strictly speaking , twice that length for a colliding flow . although higher flow velocities and/or densities ( note that at least with the densities we seem to be on the lower side of the parameter range , see e.g @xcite ) would allow shorter time scales and thus shorter coherence lengths , the question nevertheless arises whether such coherent flows are realistic . on smaller scales",
    "( and higher densities ) , the interaction of winds of nearby stars might provide a possible source ( see e.g. @xcite ) , while on larger scales , the most probable source would be interacting supernova shells .",
    "the somewhat longish assembly timescales suggest that the initial densities of the flows are more likely to be a few @xmath25 to form molecular clouds with flows of order @xmath33-@xmath34 pc length .",
    "spiral density waves can also produce coherent flows of the required length , at least in principle .",
    "the main purpose of this work was to demonstrate that precursors of molecular cloud complexes forming in colliding flows reproduce observational measures such as line - widths and column densities , without any recourse to initially imposed perturbations .",
    "the combination of dynamical and thermal instabilities efficiently generates the non - linear substructures necessary for a fast gravitational collapse and a ( close to ) instantaneous onset of star formation , thus meeting the short time scales required by observations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "once the material is cold and dense , it seems difficult to drive highly supersonic motions ( unless there is an internal driver , meaning stars ) ( @xcite ; @xcite , see however @xcite ) or even to mix it with warm gas @xcite .",
    "however , the cold and warm gas must be efficiently mixed in order to allow the cold material to move `` freely '' at velocities which are supersonic with respect to the cold gas temperature .",
    "thus , the cold substructures must arise during the formation process of the cloud , from compression and cooling in the warm phase . we demonstrated that colliding flows provide a generic physical mechanism for creating non - linear structure in pomclocs , without any recourse to perturbed initial conditions . in their further evolution ( i.e beyond the models presented here )",
    ", these non - linear perturbations will be the seeds for gravitational collapse and star formation .",
    "thus , our models show that  from a dynamical point of view ",
    "the concept of `` short '' cloud life times is feasible .",
    "ultimately , one can begin to see how realistic the concept of `` turbulent support '' of molecular clouds actually is ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an mcc in the solar neighborhood has an average column density of @xmath157 @xmath14 @xcite , coinciding with the dust - shielding column density necessary for h@xmath0 formation .",
    "once this value is reached , h@xmath0-formation is expected to begin . within @xmath1 or @xmath2 more myrs",
    ", star formation will have occurred , and the cloud will have dispersed again . within this scenario , the average column density of an ensemble of mccs should be roughly constant , implying a mass - size relation of @xmath158 .",
    "the latter would be expected for a @xcite relation of the type @xmath159 , consistent with observed scalings ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "clearly , this study leaves us with many unanswered questions .",
    "gravity might lead to global edge effects @xcite as well as to local `` supersonic '' velocities and to additional instabilities ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "actual h@xmath0 formation would further lower the temperature in the cold gas , in which case eventually supersonic velocities might be reached .",
    "the inflows might already be partially molecular , in which case the filling factor of h@xmath0 should be low @xcite . and finally , magnetic fields could influence and maybe control the structure formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
