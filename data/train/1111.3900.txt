    "the question of the stability of the ferromagnetic state against different kinds of thermal and quantum fluctuations is a crucial technological issue which at the same time provides serious challenges to a theoretical modeling and understanding .",
    "the magnetic properties of a ferromagnetic nanoparticle can be described by a heisenberg model @xmath3 with positive exchange coupling @xmath4 between microscopic spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the spins give rise to magnetic moments which are assumed to be localized at the sites @xmath7 .",
    "the latter may constitute a @xmath8-dimensional lattice of finite size with @xmath9 sites in total and constant exchange @xmath10 between nearest neighbors @xmath11 and @xmath12 only . in a ground state of the model",
    "all spins are perfectly aligned , and the particle is ferromagnetic . however",
    ", this state is unstable against thermal fluctuations .",
    "strictly speaking , for a system of finite size , the ferromagnetic state is destroyed at any finite temperature by fluctuations originating from a coupling of the system to an external heat bath .    on the other hand , anisotropic contributions to the hamiltonian , such as a single - site anisotropy of the form @xmath13 which for @xmath14 distinguishes the @xmath15-axis as the easy axis , stabilize the ferromagnetic state .",
    "inclusion of @xmath16 leads to a model with only two degenerate ground states in which all spins are pointing into the @xmath17 or @xmath18 direction , respectively .",
    "the anisotropic ferromagnetic heisenberg model @xmath19 in fact represents the simplest model to study magnetization reversal , i.e.  the thermally activated transition between two ground states across an energy barrier induced by the anisotropy .",
    "@xcite the rate of magnetization switching and thus the magnetic stability obviously crucially depends on the height of the anisotropy - energy barrier @xmath20 .        for weak anisotropy @xmath21 ,",
    "it is self - evident to consider the spins as tightly coupled by the exchange interaction and forming a huge macrospin , @xmath22 the dynamics of which can be approximated by an effective model @xmath23 with an anisotropy barrier @xmath24 in this macrospin model , magnetization reversal takes place at zero temperature by suppression of the barrier due to an external magnetic field as described by the stoner - wohlfarth model .",
    "@xcite at finite temperature @xmath25 , reversal may be caused by thermal activation .",
    "for low @xmath25 , the switching frequency is exponentially small and a ferromagnetic state is stable over macroscopically relevant times while for high @xmath25 , in the so - called superparamagnetic state , the magnetization vanishes on the time scale of the measurement .",
    "classical theory @xcite for superparamagnetic dynamics based on the landau - lifshitz equation @xcite and including a stochastic langevin field to simulate a thermal bath leads to an arrhenius law for the thermal activation rate @xmath26 .",
    "this neel - brown law again emphasizes the role of the energy barrier @xmath20 for the magnetic stability of the particle .    for stronger anisotropy , the macrospin approximation is no longer applicable as magnetization reversal preferably takes place by nucleation and domain - wall propagation ( see fig .",
    "[ mechs ] ) . here , classical many - spin models @xcite are frequently used to study the reversal mechanism and in particular the transition from coherent rotation to nucleation and domain - wall propagation with increasing strength of the anisotropy . in particular , classical monte - carlo simulations",
    "are employed @xcite where monte - carlo update steps are related to physical time propagation . as a function of the model parameters , reversal mechanisms different from coherent rotation , can be identified and `` phase boundaries '' can be found in this way .",
    "the strong influence of the shape of the nanoparticles on the switching rate , as observed experimentally , @xcite can be explained by theoretical analysis of domain - wall propagation .",
    "@xcite    the macrospin has a high spin quantum number @xmath27 and may be treated to a good approximation classically .",
    "there are , however , different types of quantum effects to be considered : for example , quantum tunneling as a reversal mechanism is competing with thermally induced reversal .",
    "@xcite in case of not too small systems , tunneling is significant only for systems extremely isolated from any dissipative environment at ultralow temperatures . for a macrospin coupled to a conduction band ,",
    "kondo screening is another issue .",
    "since @xmath28 there is an underscreened kondo effect , the development of which is hampered by the anisotropy as has been shown by time - dependent numerical renormalization group .",
    "@xcite as the quantum character of the macrospin is not accounted for by simple langevin dynamics , @xcite different approaches @xcite have been suggested to treat the macro- or many - spin dynamics in contact with bosonic baths by means of quantum master - equation approaches and to determine , e.g. , the blocking temperature .",
    "the importance of a many - spin model , for example , is demonstrated by studies of the probability density function of the macrospin obtained by replacing thermal with markov processes .",
    "@xcite differences between the classical - spin limit and large quantum spins have been discussed .",
    "@xcite    here we reconsider the question of competing reversal mechanisms by taking a quantum many - spin model as the starting point .",
    "the competition between coherent rotation and nucleation can be addressed in a less ambitious way by studying the _",
    "static _ properties of an anisotropic quantum heisenberg model @xmath29 . as the single - site anisotropy ( [ eq : hamani1 ] ) , which is frequently studied in the classical context , can not be used for the lowest spin @xmath30 in a quantum model since trivially @xmath31 , we also consider a coupling anisotropy of the form @xmath32 i.e.  @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "this model will be investigated by different complementary techniques including perturbation theory in @xmath35 , exact diagonalization and the lanczos approach for systems with small size @xmath9 and classical stability analysis in the high - spin limit .",
    "there are different goals of the present paper : as the status of the macrospin approximation is less clear in the quantum case , we aim at a strict derivation of the macrospin model in the weak - anisotropy limit . in this way it should be possible to relate the effective anisotropy strength of the macrospin to the parameters of the underlying many - spin model .",
    "the dependence on the spin quantum number @xmath0 should exhibit quantum effects for small @xmath0 and recover the classical result for @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , beyond the weak - anisotropy limit , the breakdown of the macrospin approximation and the competition between the different reversal mechanisms , depending on system size , coordination , dimensionality and on @xmath0 , will be investigated .",
    "our goal is to understand whether or not it makes a qualitative difference for the transition from coherent rotation to nucleation with increasing anisotropy strength if starting from a classical or from a quantum spin model .",
    "finally , the high - spin limit is addressed as a reference and for comparison with the quantum - mechanical calculations .",

    "as dictated by the symmetry of the model , configurations that transform into each other by rotations around the @xmath15 axis are degenerate . for a chain geometry ,",
    "there is also degeneracy between configurations obtained by mirror transformations , @xmath189 , and nucleation can thus start from both edges with equal probability .",

    "more important , however , the physical origin of the critical point can be identified easily : at @xmath168 ( or at @xmath191 , respectively ) , and approaching the critical point from the weak - anisotropy side , the optimal spin configuration exhibits an instability towards a non - collinear ordering . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ mechan ] , the instability develops simultaneously for any @xmath46 .",
    "this observation can be exploited to calculate the critical anisotropy strength for arbitrary system size and system geometry in the following way : using @xmath188 , we parameterize the spin variables as @xmath192 with @xmath193 .",
    "this yields the energy functional in the form @xmath194 which comprises both , the coupling and the single - site anisotropy case . to find the critical point",
    ", it is sufficient to concentrate on @xmath63 and to compute the magnetic response of the system in the @xmath63 state with spin configuration @xmath195 . close to the critical point , we can assume @xmath196 . expanding the total energy in powers of @xmath197 then yields @xmath198 with the inverse susceptibility matrix @xmath199 and where we have defined @xmath200 .",
    "we assume the model parameters as real and symmetric , @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "note that approaching the isotropic limit with anisotropy strength @xmath203 , the susceptibility matrix exhibits an eigenvalue approaching zero .",
    "this corresponds to an instability of the state towards ferromagnetic ordering with all @xmath204 and indicates the incipient degeneracy of states with different @xmath46 .    for finite @xmath130 ,",
    "this eigenvalue is negative and thus implies an indefinite susceptibility .",
    "this indicates that , by construction , @xmath205 refers to the thermodynamically unstable excited state with @xmath63 and @xmath206 .",
    "the _ local _ instability of this state towards a non - collinear alignment of the magnetic moments at the critical anisotropy strength @xmath187 shows up as a zero of another eigenvalue of @xmath205 .",

    "results for the critical anisotropy strength as a function of the system size are shown in fig .",
    "[ critical ] for both , coupling and single - site anisotropy and for systems of different dimensions @xmath8 . in all cases we considered systems with open boundaries .",
    "generally , the anisotropy strength up to which the macrospin approximation is found to be valid , decreases rapidly with system size but depends only weakly on the type of the anisotropy term .",
    "there is also a weak dependence on the form of the particle as is obvious from the comparison of cubic arrays and spheres in @xmath210 dimensions .    for small nanosystems ,",
    "the dimension and shape dependence of @xmath187 is somewhat irregular . for a larger number of classical spins , on the other hand , the critical anisotropy strength for which the macrospin model can be applied ,",
    "is the stronger the higher the dimension of the nanostructure . in fact , in the limit @xmath128 , the different results are found to follow a simple power law , @xmath211 where @xmath8 is the dimensionality , @xmath9 the number of spins and @xmath212 the _ linear _ extension of the system .",
    "this can easily be explained by comparing the energy barrier for coherent rotation @xmath213 with the barrier for nucleation and domain - wall propagation @xmath214 . while the volume of the system @xmath215 is relevant for @xmath216 , the @xmath217-dimensional domain wall of width @xmath218 @xcite essentially determines @xmath219 .",
    "the critical anisotropy is then obtained from @xmath220 , resulting in the scaling law ( [ eq : scal ] ) .",
    "anisotropy terms coupled to the ferromagnetic heisenberg model of many - spin nanosystems give rise to an energy barrier @xmath20 that crucially determines the thermal activation of magnetization reversal and thus the magnetic stability of nanosystems .",
    "employing perturbation theory , exact diagonalization and lanczos as well as classical total - energy minimization and stability analysis , different quantum effects have been revealed that substantially affect the barrier height .",
    "quantum effects are absent in the limit of strong anisotropy @xmath130 . for @xmath221",
    "the ising model is approached , i.e.  a classical model where there are no quantum fluctuations .",
    "the magnetization - reversal mechanism in the ising limit is given by nucleation at the edge or surface of the system followed by the propagation of a domain wall with minimal ( unit ) width .",
    "with decreasing anisotropy strength , the domain - wall width increases .",
    "finally , a critical value @xmath222 is reached where the reversal mechanism changes to a coherent rotation of the spins that are tightly aligned by the exchange coupling @xmath209 and form a huge macrospin .",
    "this critical anisotropy strength is well defined in the classical limit @xmath36 ( with model parameters rescaled by the factor @xmath223 ) and can be computed for arbitrary dimension , system size and shape by an analysis of the local stability of the susceptibility matrix in the globally ( thermodynamically ) unstable excited state at the top of the barrier . for @xmath224 ,",
    "i.e.  for coherent rotation , the classical anisotropy - barrier height is simply given by @xmath225 , i.e. : @xmath226 this is the same as the barrier of a classical macrospin of length @xmath227 , composed of microscopic spins of unit length @xmath228 , as described by a macrospin model @xmath229 with a barrier @xmath230 if @xmath231 .",
    "classically , and in the regime where coherent rotations takes place , the macrospin approximation is exact .",
    "the first quantum effect manifests itself in the absence of the a well - defined critical anisotropy strength .",
    "as can be seen in the spin - spin correlation function @xmath175 , there is rather a smooth crossover from nucleation and domain - wall propagation to coherent rotation with decreasing @xmath130 .",
    "this crossover becomes less and less sharp with decreasing @xmath0 , i.e.  as the importance of quantum fluctuations increases .",
    "second , for any finite anisotropy strength , the macrospin approximation is no longer correct in the quantum case . only within perturbation theory to first order in @xmath130 , the macrospin model emerges as the effective low - energy theory of the anisotropic quantum heisenberg model . comparing the true anisotropy - energy barrier @xmath20 of the many - spin system with the one of the corresponding effective macrospin model , we find @xmath232 in the quantum case , there is virtually never a reversal by pure coherent rotation but always some `` admixture '' of nucleation and domain - wall propagation .",
    "the latter leads to the decrease of @xmath20 as compared to @xmath233 .",
    "this quantum effect becomes more and more pronounced with increasing anisotropy strength , with increasing system size , with decreasing dimensionality and with decreasing average coordination number .",
    "third , the quantum derivation of the macrospin model by means of first - order perturbation theory provides an explicit expression for the anisotropy parameter [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : macro1 ] ) and ( [ eq : macro2 ] ) ] .",
    "this leads to an energy barrier that is lower than the classical one : @xmath234 consider a single - site anisotropy case as an example : after the rescaling @xmath235 we have @xmath236 [ l^2s^2 / s(s+1 ) ] d$ ] .",
    "therewith , the classical result ( [ eq : deltaeclass ] ) is recovered in the high - spin limit : @xmath237 . in the low - spin case ,",
    "e.g.  for @xmath163 , which is the extreme case for single - site anisotropy , however , we have @xmath238 . this is smaller by a factor of 4 than the classical barrier @xmath239 . even in the limit of large systems @xmath128 , there is substantial difference , @xmath240 compared to the classical limit which is approached rather slowly , i.e.   @xmath241 .",
    "we conclude that , in addition to quantum many - spin effects , there is a quantum correction of the macro - spin model itself which , for low spin quantum numbers , can be as important as the former one ."
