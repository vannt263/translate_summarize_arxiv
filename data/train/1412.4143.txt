    "resolution 1 of the 24th meeting of the general conference on weights and measures ( cgpm ) outlines a revised international system of units ( si ) based upon fixed numerical values of invariants of nature  @xcite .",
    "a consequence is that the unit of mass will be realized through an assigned value of the planck constant , @xmath2 .",
    "a method for realizing mass via @xmath2 utilizes a watt balance that requires the determination of the local acceleration of gravity , @xmath3 , with parts in @xmath1 accuracy . at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) ,",
    "significant progress has been made with the existing watt balance ( nist-3 ) towards providing the necessary experimental results  @xcite for the possible si redefinition to occur at the 26th meeting of the cgpm . in preparation for disseminating mass in the revised si , a new robust nist watt balance , nist-4 ,",
    "is being constructed  @xcite .",
    "we discuss our methods for modeling the new nist-4 laboratory and major instrument components , our measurements of gravity and final results , and our uncertainty analysis  @xcite .",
    "to summarize the operational principle of a watt balance , the measurements involved relate the planck constant to mass , length , and frequency through @xmath4 where @xmath5 is mass , @xmath3 is the local acceleration due to gravity , @xmath6 is a velocity , and @xmath7 is a combination of frequencies and scalar constants . with a total uncertainty goal for the watt balance on the order of a few parts in @xmath0 , equation  [ eq : prin ] highlights the importance of determining @xmath3 at the location of the mass standard used in a watt balance to an accuracy of a few parts in @xmath1 or lower such that its uncertainty is negligible in the final watt balance result .",
    "a challenge in evaluation of @xmath3 for the recent nist-3 result  @xcite was that the apparatus was physically in the way .",
    "moreover , the measurements of the absolute value of @xmath3 were performed intermittently , with corrections being applied for tidal , polar motion , and atmospheric effects during the operation of the watt balance .",
    "the determination of gravity for nist-4 follows that of more thorough evaluations of gravity of other watt balance efforts  @xcite .",
    "ties ( the difference in gravity between two points ) were measured between absolute measurement locations and the horizontal - plane position of the nist-4 test mass along the vertical concentric symmetry axis of the permanent magnet used to generate the magnetic field for nist-4 .",
    "this was done before the mass pan and related components were installed , which will prevent such measurements in the future .",
    "these measurements allow us to validate and refine the gravity model of the room and the apparatus so that the model may be used for gravity determinations in the future .",
    "furthermore , a permanent relative gravimeter will be installed in the location of previously - recorded measurements of absolute @xmath3 for real time monitoring .    to stay consistent with the field of absolute gravimetry , the non si unit of acceleration ,",
    "the gal ( symbol gal ) , is used in this text .",
    "it is defined as 1gal = 1cm / s@xmath8  @xcite .",
    "[ fig:218 ]        the model of the nist-4 laboratory and components was created using the method of right rectangular prisms  @xcite . following  @xcite ,",
    "this method was chosen because it provides a simple analytical solution for the gravitational attraction in the vertical direction at any point in space .",
    "the accuracy of the solution is then only dependent on the accuracy in the gravitational constant , @xmath9 , and object densities and dimensions .",
    "the coordinate system was chosen such that most significant rectangular components were aligned , and non - rectangular components were approximated with simple algorithms to break them into a finite number of prisms of varying dimensions .",
    "the laboratory for the nist-4 watt balance is in a subterranean building approximately 11.5 m underground and is much closer to the building limits on the south and west facing walls than on the others , as shown in figure  [ fig:218 ] .",
    "this placement results in a significant change in gravity as a function of horizontal position across the room .",
    "the watt balance sits on the center of a 60metric ton concrete slab ( dimensions : 4m@xmath104m@xmath102.4 m ) , with the magnet and horizontal position of the test mass offset by approximate 25 cm in both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 directions .",
    "the greatest contributors to changes in gravity throughout the laboratory are the concrete slab and the surrounding earth , which were assumed to have average densities of 2.4g/@xmath13 and 1.4g/@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "a horizontal mapping of the gravity at a height of 25.9 cm from the top surface of the concrete slab was made in july 2013 using a scintrex cg-5 autograv relative gravimeter  @xcite . at that time , a 1 m diameter hole existed in the center of the concrete slab , extending through the bottom .",
    "the results were used as an initial confirmation of the model , which neglects the building foundation and other relatively insignificant changes in density .",
    "the model extended the earth below and on the sides of the laboratory to approximately 100 m from the center of the slab .",
    "figure  [ fig : gmaps ] shows both the measurements and the model at the same height .",
    "note that the reduction in gravitational attraction due to the hole in the slab appears off center in the measurements plot .",
    "this is believed to be measurement error due to using a coarse measurement grid and because only two measurements were used for an average in each position ( data was smoothed by interpolating between measurements ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : residuals ] shows the difference between the model and the measurements at the grid spacing of the measurement . generally , the model is in good agreement with the measurement .",
    "the model reproduces the gradient along the @xmath12-direction .",
    "the largest residuals occur at the position of the hole and can be explained with worse measurement conditions .",
    "the hole was covered with plywood , providing a less stable base than the block itself .        in order to use the model to predict gravity variations between absolute reference points and the test mass location , several of the more massive components of nist-4",
    "were modeled to account for instrument self - attraction .",
    "a visualization of these modeled components is shown in figure  [ fig : comps ] , along with a photograph of the lower half of the vacuum chamber during installation .",
    "the approximate masses of these objects is given in table  [ table : mass ] .",
    "the modeled gravitational attraction of each of these components as a function of height ( on axis with the center of the magnet ) is shown in figure  [ fig : contributions ] .",
    "note that the magnet is much heavier than any of the other components and thus is responsible for most of the instrument self - attraction .",
    "the other modeled components create a gravitational attraction on the order of about @xmath14 each .",
    "thus , no other components were modeled as their effect was determined to be negligible . the full model , including major nist-4 components , at a height of 130 cm ( approximately the normal height of the test mass ) is shown in figure  [ fig : fmodel ] .",
    "the effect of the vacuum bell jar was modeled and the gravitational attraction was found to be below 1@xmath15gal .",
    ".masses of components in the computer model to calculate the gravitational field . [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : validation ]",
    "gravity variations for the laboratory of the new nist-4 watt balance were modeled and showed good agreement with a mapping made one year prior .",
    "four ( partially ) unique ties between absolute gravity reference points and the nist-4 test mass location were established through relative measurements , and a total uncertainty of only about 4@xmath16 was obtained , well within the necessary range required by the watt balance experiment .",
    "several relatively massive watt balance components were modeled , and modeled ties were shown to be accurate within about 0.7@xmath17 of one measured tie and within about 5.5@xmath17 of the other measured tie . in the future , both the model and the presented data will be used for determination of absolute gravity at the precise test mass location once nist-4 is fully operational .",
    "the authors would like to thank jacques liard for guidance on modeling and measuring gravity",
