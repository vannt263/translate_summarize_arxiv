    "recent results on standard model higgs production at the lhc @xcite have gained lots of attention throughout the high energy physics community . on the one hand , this is due to the tantalizing hints for a light higgs boson around @xmath2 .",
    "the implications of the observed excess have already been discussed in the literature  @xcite , yet , it is too early to claim that the higgs has been found and we might well observe a statistical fluctuation  @xcite .    on the other hand , the 95% confidence level bounds published by atlas and cms state that if a higgs - like resonance is to be realized at higher masses , the higgs boson is significantly underproduced or has suppressed branching fractions to the ( partially ) visible decay channels .",
    "this has triggered some effort in how to reconcile one or more heavy higgs bosons in the light of this heavily constraining data through modified production cross sections  @xcite , decays  @xcite , or combinations of both  @xcite .",
    "the dominant channel which drives the exclusion bounds in the high higgs mass regime is the clean higgs decay channel to four leptons via two @xmath3 bosons  @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` gold - plated '' mode allows a great deal of higgs `` spectroscopy '' as soon as the decay channel @xmath4 opens up .",
    "statics in this channel is limited due to the branching ratios of the @xmath3 bosons to the light and clean leptons @xmath5 , but it benefits from a large branching ratio @xmath4 for heavy higgs masses @xmath6 . the dominant partial decay width to longitudinal @xmath7 is a direct consequence of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the purely leptonic final state of @xmath8 can be fully reconstructed and , hence , its merits range from line - shape measurements  @xcite to obtaining spin and @xmath9 of the reconstructed excess  @xcite . of similar importance in the high higgs mass region at the 14  tev lhc",
    "are the semi - hadronic @xmath10 decay modes for boosted kinematics  @xcite .    avoiding a large branching ratio @xmath4 , or in general @xmath11",
    ", @xmath12 , for heavy higgs particles is theoretically challenging unless we allow for non - perturbative strong couplings  @xcite .",
    "the reason is that ordinary perturbative @xmath13 interactions of a minimally extended higgs sector , _",
    "i.e. _ the ones which do not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking , can not compete against the fast - growing partial decay width of the higgs @xmath14 .",
    "higgs - portal type interactions are pushed into a non - perturbative regime by requiring a vanishing @xmath15 phenomenology  @xcite .    one way to reconcile a vanishing higgs phenomenology in @xmath16 in a controlled way",
    "is by turning to strongly coupled theories in the  t hooft limit  @xcite . a playground , which serves as a model - building dictionary ,",
    "is the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite of randall - sundrum models  @xcite .",
    "while rs i type models predict a tower of scalar and/or vectorial resonances which can be tackled with standard search strategies in the @xmath17 final states  @xcite , the phenomenology of rs ii models can be fundamentally different . once put into a realistic form by introducing a weak breaking of conformal invariance via a modulation of the ads metric towards the infrared  @xcite , such models can be interpreted as `` unparticles '' in georgi s language  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that such a non - local object can , in fact , be responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking , restoring the good high energy behavior of longitudinal gauge boson scattering  @xcite , while it behaves very much like an ordinary higgs in electroweak precision tests @xcite .",
    "in essence , the model s gauge sector at low energies is similar to the sm , while this is not necessarily true for the unhiggs - fermion sector  @xcite .",
    "therefore every channel which allows cross - talk between the fermion and the gauge boson sector is a strong probe of such a mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the production of the unhiggs from gluon fusion and its subsequent decay precisely serves this purpose .",
    "given the recently observed underproduction of higgs - like states in the @xmath10 channel it is possible to formulate bounds on unhiggs - symmetry breaking , which is the purpose of this paper .",
    "as it turns out , the gold - plated mode is perfectly suited for such a reanalysis , since systematics for heavy higgses are sufficiently small in the fully reconstructed final state .",
    "note that this is vastly different from @xmath18 , which drives the higgs exclusion for very heavy higgs masses  @xcite .",
    "systematic uncertainties in these channels limit a straightforward re - application of the existing strategies pursued by atlas and cms .",
    "we organize this work as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] provides a recap of the model s properties to make this work self - contained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we first validate our analysis strategy against the results of refs .  @xcite .",
    "in particular we show that we can reproduce the experiments exclusion bounds in the higgs mass region we are interested in .",
    "we subsequently compute the exclusion bounds on the unhiggs model s parameters that are implied by the data of refs .",
    "@xcite in sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] .",
    "we give our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "the gauge interactions of the unhiggs field @xmath19 follow from the effective lagrangian  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the familiar @xmath22 gauge covariant derivative , @xmath23 is the unhiggs field s scaling dimension and @xmath24 is the infrared cut - off of the conformal sector . consequently , the gauge interactions of the unhiggs can be dialed away by increasing @xmath25 .",
    "the naive growth with the center of mass energy of the longitudinal gauge boson scattering amplitude , which would eventually lead to unitarity violation if left un - tamed , is cured by non - local interactions  @xcite .",
    "similar gauge cancellations in massive quark annihilation to longitudinal gauge bosons constrain the unhiggs scaling dimension @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 implies modifications of the massive fermion sector by inducing non - local contributions .",
    "these can eventually alter also the higgs phenomenology for low masses in _",

    "( [ eq : switchoff ] ) and the sm yukawa sector is unitarity - conserving , and results in a similar higgs phenomenology for higgs masses below the @xmath3 and @xmath31 thresholds .    since the resulting higgs field is manifestly non - local as a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ eq : switchoff ] ) , so are the longitudinal gauge bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ the would - be nambu goldstone bosons in unitary gauge",
    ". the higgs two - point function is given by a pole at what would be interpreted as the physical higgs particle ( dubbed `` unhiggs '' in the following ) and a branch cut above the conformal symmetry breaking scale @xmath24 .",
    "the impact of this continuum is , however , phenomenologically irrelevant at the lhc for small @xmath25 since it is difficult to access the gauge boson s polarizations in a clean way in the context of higgs production  @xcite .",
    "the resulting contribution to the cross section of the order of a few percent in @xmath32 , is difficult to isolate from background uncertainties , especially at the given luminosity @xmath33 , which predicts only a couple of events in the decay leptons invariant mass tails .",
    "hence search strategies will be sensitive to the modifications of the unhiggs with respect to the sm higgs .     +    due to the modifications of the higgs sector that arise from eq .",
    "( [ eq : switchoff ] ) after electroweak symmetry breaking , both the partial decay width ( _ i.e. _ the line shape ) and the production cross section are modified .",
    "more precisely , the unhiggs propagator reads @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the pole mass .",
    "the top - yukawa coupling for @xmath26 follows from @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the model s cut - off scale ( see  refs .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "@xmath38}{(\\mu^2 - q^2)^{2 - d}-(\\mu^2 -              m_h^2)^{2 - d } }          \\right|^2_{q^2=\\sqrt{s}}\\ , ,        \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39    the above modification of width stems from the pole contribution and its decay to sm particles .",
    "this should be contrasted to an additional imaginary part that the propagator eq .",
    "( [ eq : prop ] ) can pick up .",
    "( [ eq4b ] ) gives an approximation for the pole contribution in terms of cross section times branching ratio . in the final analysis we use the full off - shell propagator",
    "including imaginary parts in sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds ] , _ i.e. _ the one that arises from the conformal structure of the propagator and the one that arises from the decay of the @xmath35 state .",
    "doing so , we recover the sm propagators , widths and cross sections upon taking the limit @xmath40 .",
    "this is also clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq4a])-([eq4c ] ) , for @xmath40 we have @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath42 channel is potentially sensitive to both of these modifications in the heavy mass region @xmath43 , especially because the observed higgs width is dominated by the physical one  @xcite . for light higgs particles",
    "the width is dominated by the detector resolution , also in the gold - plated @xmath4 decay mode ( see _ e.g. _",
    "to formulate exclusion bounds on the unhiggs model , we apply a binned log - likelihood ratio hypothesis test as formulated during the lep2 era in the context of higgs searches  @xcite .",
    "the test statistic is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the poissonian likelihood , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of expected events at a given luminosity and @xmath48 is the number of actually observed events in the unhiggs model .",
    "the generalization to binned histograms is straightforward .    the test statistic eq .",
    "( [ eq : loglike2 ] ) is different from the profile likelihood which is employed by atlas and cms  @xcite in its asymptotic behavior and in the treatment of uncertainties",
    ". since the shape and systematic uncertainties are not publicly available , we neglect them throughout and take the distributions by atlas and cms at face value .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",

    "[ fig : mud ] we show the dependence of @xmath55 on @xmath24 for a representative value of the higgs mass . from this figure",
    "we see that a variation of @xmath24 in the signal hypothesis leaves our findings for @xmath51 largely unmodified unless we face a situation where the conformal symmetry breaking scale @xmath24 is close to the unhiggs pole mass .",
    "if we consider the situation @xmath56 there is an additional contribution to the width @xcite , which eventually can yield @xmath57 .",

    "local deficits and excesses in the data do typically not change this situation , _",
    "i.e. _ when we see a deficit in data this typically carries over to a larger - than - expected @xmath51 for fixed @xmath63",
    ". the combination of both searches in regions where the data is consistent with the background allows to impose even stronger bounds on unhiggs production , as can be seen from the comparison of figs .",
    "[ fig : unhiggscl ] with [ fig : unhiggsclcomb ] .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : exiref ] ( and refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it is clear that for some higgs masses we observe excesses @xmath54 by the individual experiments .",
    "since the unhiggs model generically predicts smaller cross sections in @xmath64 for @xmath58 than encountered in the sm , we are therefore not able to put bounds on the unhiggs model in these particular regions for the individual analyses .",
    "cms and atlas , however , observe these excesses in different higgs mass regions .",
    "this allows us to constrain the full considered higgs mass range in the unhiggs model from the combination of the atlas and cms searches , yielding @xmath65 over the entire mass range @xmath66 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unhiggsdmh ] , where we scan the observed 95% cl on @xmath51 over the mass range @xmath67 ( again for @xmath52 ) .",
    "the shaded areas represent higgs mass regions where atlas and cms can not constrain the unhiggs model individually",
    ". the combination of the two experiments amounts to a combined bound of @xmath68 . in the region where no bound can be imposed by the atlas experiment ,",
    "the observed exclusion is @xmath69 , which results from a rather large @xmath70 upward fluctuation .",
    "this excess weakens the observed cms exclusion in the combination , which holds also vice - versa for @xmath71 in a more pronounced way .    in total ,",
    "the resulting sm bounds translate into only mild bounds on unhiggs production , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 . expecting @xmath73 in the unhiggs scenario ,",
    "these constraints are not strong enough to rule out the existence of the unhiggs scenario .",
    "this , however , should be possible with the future increase of luminosity and .",
    "the lhc has tested standard model higgs production at @xmath74 tev center of mass energy with a luminosity of about 5 fb@xmath75 .",
    "significant bounds on the sm higgs could be established in 2011 by both atlas and cms .",
    "the combination of both data sets allows to impose constraints @xmath76 over the range @xmath77 in the @xmath42 channel .",
    "we show that we can reproduce the experiments sensitivity to very good approximation , thus allowing us to understand the observed underproduction if a higgs is realized in this particular mass range in terms of unhiggs symmetry breaking .",
    "we find that the data only mildly constrains the unhiggs scenario @xmath72 , with a very flat dependence of these results on the high scale conformal symmetry breaking scale as long as @xmath58 .",
