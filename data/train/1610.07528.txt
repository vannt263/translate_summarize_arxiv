    "we now reinterpret this in terms of the farey graph @xmath25 .",
    "recall from the introduction that the vertex set of @xmath25 consists of primitive elements of @xmath58 up to negation , so can be identified with @xmath59 through the map @xmath60 under this identification , the action of @xmath61 on @xmath62 is by fractional linear transformations .",
    "two vertices @xmath63 are adjacent if @xmath64 , so @xmath65 is exactly the set of vertices in @xmath25 that @xmath4 translates a distance of @xmath66 .        fix a matrix @xmath0 and let @xmath69 be a @xmath70-orbit of @xmath4 . adding in edges connecting each @xmath71 to @xmath72",

    "the turning number at @xmath74 is positive if the turn is counterclockwise when @xmath75 is traversed positively , and negative when the turn is clockwise . when @xmath76 , the turning number is just @xmath77 .",
    "for instance , in figure [ iteration ] all turning numbers on the red 1-orbit are @xmath31 , on the blue 1-orbit they are @xmath78 .    when @xmath61 is orientation preserving , all the turning numbers on a given 1-orbit coincide . on the other hand , if @xmath61 is orientation reversing then the turning numbers on a 1-orbit all have the same absolute value and alternate sign .",
    "as @xmath79 acts edge transitively on @xmath25 , any @xmath70-orbit of @xmath61 may be translated to pass through @xmath80 , which conjugates @xmath4 so that it has the form @xmath81 when @xmath4 is as above , the turning number at @xmath82 is @xmath83 . checking eigenvalues , two matrices @xmath84 , where @xmath85 , are conjugate in @xmath86 if and only if @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "this implies that the turning numbers of all the 1-orbits of a matrix @xmath4 have the same absolute value .",
    "it suffices to prove the lemma when @xmath90 as above . here",
    ", the conjugacy classes of @xmath68 correspond to the cases @xmath91 , so the goal is to prove that there are two 1-orbits in those cases , and one otherwise .    *",
    "if @xmath92 , then @xmath93 and one can check directly that the only 1-orbit of @xmath4 is the edge connecting @xmath94 . * if @xmath95 and @xmath96 , then @xmath4 is orientation preserving and @xmath97 .",
    "each of its @xmath66-orbits has turning number either @xmath66 or @xmath98 , so bounds a complementary triangle in @xmath25 .",

    "if @xmath95 and @xmath100 , then @xmath61 is parabolic . its 1-orbit has turning number @xmath101 , so consists of all vertices in the @xmath25-link of the fixed point of @xmath4 .      * if @xmath103 and @xmath104 , then @xmath4 is hyperbolic and orientation - reversing .",
    "the turning numbers on a 1-orbit @xmath69 alternate sign , so there is an edge of @xmath75 that separates @xmath105 from @xmath106 in the upper half plane .",
    "any other 1-orbit would then have to intersect @xmath69 , which is impossible , so @xmath4 has a single 1-orbit",
    ". see figure [ reversingturning ] for an illustration of the case @xmath107 .",
    "* if @xmath108 and @xmath109 , then @xmath4 is orientation preserving , hyperbolic and conjugate to @xmath5 . when @xmath110 , the orbits of @xmath98 and @xmath111 are distinct , since they have opposite turning numbers ( see figure  [ iteration ] ) .",
    "since the edge from @xmath98 to @xmath111 in @xmath25 separates the attracting and repelling fixed points of @xmath4 , any 1-orbit of @xmath4 must pass through either @xmath98 or @xmath82 .",
    "so , the orbits of @xmath112 and @xmath98 are the only 1-orbits .",
    "the argument when @xmath113 is similar .",
    ", its _ 1-orbits _ , on which the matrix acts as a translation by a distance of @xmath66 .",
    "the action is hyperbolic , with every forward orbit converging to @xmath114 and every backwards orbit converging to @xmath115 .",
    "incidentally , the square of @xmath116 is a conjugate of @xmath117 , which is why the vertex set of the 1-orbit in figure [ reversingturning ] is a translation of the union of the vertices of the two 1-orbits above . ]",
    "it remains to deal with the case @xmath108 , @xmath118 , in which case @xmath4 is again orientation preserving and hyperbolic .",
    "we claim that any biinfinite path @xmath69 whose turning numbers are all at least @xmath31 in absolute value is a geodesic in @xmath25 , and that if the turning numbers are all at least @xmath119 in absolute value then @xmath69 is the unique geodesic in @xmath120 connecting its endpoints .",
    "this will imply that when @xmath118 , the matrix @xmath4 has only a single 1-orbit .",
    "so , suppose that @xmath122 is a biinfinite path in @xmath25 whose turning numbers are all at least @xmath123 in absolute value . for each @xmath124 ,",
    "let @xmath125 be the edge of @xmath25 incident to @xmath126 that lies between the edges @xmath127 $ ] and @xmath128 $ ] , and shares a complementary triangle of @xmath25 with @xmath128 $ ] , as in figure [ third ] .",
    "each @xmath125 separates @xmath129 from @xmath130 , so by planarity all the @xmath125 are disjoint .",
    "two vertices @xmath126 and @xmath131 , with @xmath132 , are disjoint from and separated by all the edges @xmath133 any path from @xmath126 to @xmath131 must go through all of these edges , so must have length at least @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , @xmath69 is a geodesic in @xmath25 .",
    "suppose now that all the turning numbers of @xmath122 are at least @xmath135 in absolute value .",
    "choose for each @xmath136 two more edges @xmath137 incident to @xmath126 that lie between @xmath127 $ ] and @xmath128 $ ] , as in figure [ third ] .",
    "all the edges @xmath138 separate the forward and backward limits of @xmath69 , so any geodesic @xmath139 in @xmath25 connecting these limits must pass through a vertex of each @xmath138 . as @xmath139 can not pass through all three of the non-@xmath126 vertices of @xmath138 , it must pass through @xmath126 , so @xmath140 .",
    "thus , @xmath69 is the unique geodesic in @xmath25 connecting its endpoints .",
    "this concludes the proof of lemma [ geometrytorus ] , and thus the proof of theorem [ torus2 ] ."
