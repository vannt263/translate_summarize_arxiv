    "selective trace_. we briefly sketch what a selective trace is in the next paragraph .",
    "recall that a closed walk about a vertex , @xmath96 , is a walk in the graph beginning and ending at @xmath96 . recall that the trace of the @xmath97-th power of the adjacency matrix equals the sum over all @xmath96 of the number of closed walks about @xmath96 of length @xmath97 .",
    "the _ @xmath97-th irreducible trace _ ( used in both @xcite and @xcite ) is the same sum as the @xmath97-th power trace , except that we require the closed walks to be _",

    "a selective trace is a sum like an irreducible trace , but where we further require that the walk have no small contiguous piece that `` traces out '' a `` supercritical tangle '' ( the notions of `` tracing out '' and `` supercritical tangles '' will be defined later ; roughly speaking , a `` supercritical tangle '' is a small graph with many cycles ) .",
    "since these `` tangles '' occur with probability at most proportional to @xmath98 , with @xmath99 as in theorem  [ th : main ] , the selective trace usually agrees with the standard `` irreducible '' trace .    analyzing the selective traces",
    "involves a new concept of the `` new type , '' which is a refinement of the `` type '' of @xcite .",
    "we caution the reader about the notation used here . in this paper",
    "we work with only @xmath0-regular graphs . in @xcite @xmath100-regular graphs",
    "were studied ; in @xcite the graphs are usually @xmath100-regular , although for a part of section  3 the graphs are @xmath0-regular .",
    "we also caution the reader that here we use the term `` irreducible '' ( as used in @xcite and , for example , in the text @xcite ) as opposed to `` reduced '' ( which is quite common ) or `` non - backtracking '' ( sometimes used in @xcite ) in describing walks and related concepts .",
    "we hope to generalize or `` relativize '' the theorems here to theorems about new eigenvalues of random covers ( see @xcite for a relativized broder - shamir theorem ) . in this paper",
    "we occasionally go out of our way to use a technique that will easily generalize to this setting .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",

    "we describe `` types '' and `` new types , '' explaining how they help to estimate `` walk sums ; '' walk sums are generalizations of all notions of `` trace '' used here . in section  6",
    "we describe the `` selective trace '' used in this paper ; we give a crucial lemma that counts certain types of selective closed walks in a graph . in section  7",
    "we explain a little about `` @xmath0-ramanujan '' functions , giving a theorem to be used in section  14 that also illustrates one of the main technical points in section  8 .",

    "section  2 explains the problems with the trace method encountered in @xcite .",

    "subsection  6.4 and section  14 involve the alon conjecture for @xmath104 .    throughout the rest of this paper",
    "we will work with @xmath29 unless we explicitly say otherwise , and we understand @xmath0 to be a fixed integer at least @xmath105 . at times we insist that @xmath0 be even ( for example , in dealing with @xmath29 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "in this section we summarize the trace method used in @xcite , and why this method can not prove alon s conjecture . during this section",
    "we will review some of the ideas of @xcite , involving asymptotic expansions of various types of traces , which we modify in later sections to complete our proof of alon s conjecture .",
    "we begin by recalling the trace method as used in @xcite , and why it did not yield the alon conjecture .",
    "the trace method ( see @xcite , for example ) determines information on the eigenvalues of a random graph in a certain probability space by computing the expected value of a sufficiently high power of the adjacency matrix , @xmath106 ; this expected value equals the expected value of the sum of that power of the eigenvalues , since @xmath107 now @xmath108 may also be interpreted as the number of closed walks ( i.e. , walks ( see section 3.1 ) in the graph that start and end at the same vertex ) of length @xmath97 .",
    "now restrict our discussion to @xmath29 .",
    "a word , @xmath109 , of length @xmath97 over the alphabet @xmath110 ( i.e. each @xmath111 ) , determines a random permutation , and the @xmath112-th entry of @xmath113 , is just the number of words , @xmath114 , of length @xmath97 , taking @xmath88 to @xmath115 . but given a word , @xmath114 , the probability , @xmath116 , that @xmath114 takes @xmath88 to @xmath88 is clearly independent of @xmath88 .",

    "this analysis was refined in @xcite .",
    "we review the ideas there .",
    "first , a word , @xmath114 , is said to be _ irreducible _ if @xmath114 contains no consecutive occurence of @xmath119 .",
    "it is well - known that any word , @xmath114 , has a unique _ reduction _ to an irreducible word elements ( see @xcite , sections  1 and 7 of chapter 1 ) .",
    "alternatively , see proposition  2.5 of @xcite or theorem  1 of @xcite ( this theorem says that a free group on a set , @xmath120 , is in one - to - one correspondence with the set of reduced words , @xmath121 , which means that every word over @xmath121 has a unique corresponding reduced word ; here `` reduced '' is our `` irreducible '' ) . ] ( or reduced word ) , @xmath122 , obtained from @xmath114 by repeatedly discarding any consecutive occurences of @xmath123 and @xmath124 in @xmath114 , and @xmath125 .",
    "similarly a walk is said to be _",
    "irreducible _ if it contains no occurrence of a step along an edge immediately followed by the reverse step along that edge .",
    "similarly , every irreducible walk has a unique reduction .",
    "let @xmath126 be the set of irreducible words of length @xmath97 , and let @xmath127 be the number of irreducible closed walks of length @xmath97 in @xmath14 in terms of @xmath14 , but we shall soon see ( lemma  [ lm : chebyshev ] ) that @xmath127 can be defined as a polynomial in @xmath106 and @xmath0 . ] .",

    "it is easy to see that for any fixed word , @xmath114 , we have a power series expansion @xmath131 ( see , for example , theorem  [ th : exp_polys ] ) .    as examples , we note that for a random permutation , @xmath132 , on @xmath133 , the probability that the sequence @xmath134 first returns to @xmath68 at @xmath135 ( i.e. , the probability that @xmath68 lies on a cycle of length exactly @xmath97 ) is @xmath101 for @xmath136 .",
    "it follows that @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the number of positive integral divisors of @xmath139 , assuming @xmath140 . in this example",

    "it is then easy to see that @xmath144 provided that @xmath145 are at most @xmath16 . if @xmath145 are at least @xmath30 , then the @xmath146 are non - zero for @xmath147 and involve number theoretic functions of @xmath145 for @xmath21 .",
    "so set @xmath148 ( we easily see @xmath149 for @xmath150 and @xmath151 and so @xmath152 for @xmath151 ) .    [",

    "this , it turns out , gives a second eigenvalue bound of roughly @xmath163 for a universal constant , @xmath55 .",

    "it follows that for any @xmath5 we have @xmath1856 this ( and theorem",

    "the proofs of the theorems are as the proof for @xmath29 .",
    "we only need to establish the following results for the different models of random graph :    1 .",
    "labelling : the model comes with edges labelled from a set @xmath398 such that to each @xmath1857 we associate a @xmath397 such that @xmath1858 ( in other words , the elements of @xmath398 are paired , with the possibility that an element is paired with itself ) .",
    "coincidence : if @xmath97 of the random edges have been determined , and if we fix any two vertices , @xmath1859 , in the graph , then the probability that an edge of a given label takes @xmath96 to @xmath114 is at most @xmath1860 for some constant @xmath10 .",
    "we have only briefly mentioned coincidences in this paper , but our lemmas  [ lm : big_order ] and [ lm : equiv_classes ] , proven in @xcite , require a property like this .",
    "3 .   expansion with error : consider a @xmath398-labelled graph , @xmath338 , with vertices a subset of @xmath4 , that can occur as a subgraph of a graph in our model .",
    "the probability that @xmath338 occurs must depend only on the number of edges , @xmath1861 , of each label , @xmath132 ( of course , @xmath1862 ) .",
    "furthermore , this probability times the number subsets of @xmath4 of size @xmath1863 is , for every positive integer @xmath250 , @xmath1864 where @xmath791 are polynomials in @xmath1865 ( where @xmath1865 is the collection of all @xmath1861 ) and where @xmath1866 for all @xmath1867 , where @xmath1868 depend only on @xmath250 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1869 if @xmath88 is less than the order of @xmath338 .",
    "simple word sum : let @xmath867 be those words that begin with @xmath123 , end in @xmath12 , and are _ irreducible _ ( meaning no consecutive occurrence of @xmath132 and @xmath1707 ) .",
    "then for any polynomial , @xmath1870 ( with @xmath1865 as above ) , we require @xmath1871 for a polynomial , @xmath1872 , and a function @xmath373 with @xmath1873 for some constant @xmath10 ( i.e. , the above sum is super-@xmath0-ramanujan ) .",
    "@xmath49 determination : we must determine @xmath49 for the model . 6 .   spreading : there is a constant @xmath1583 such that the probability that a random graph has @xmath1874 for some @xmath1829 is of order at most @xmath1875 .",
    "we have already shown spreading and determined @xmath49 for all three models .",
    "the labelling of the models is quite simple : @xmath57 is labelled like @xmath29 ; @xmath65 is labelled with @xmath1876 where @xmath1877 ( each @xmath1878 represents a perfect matching ) ; @xmath69 is labelled with @xmath1879 with @xmath1880 as before and @xmath1881 with @xmath1882 , and where the @xmath1878 represent the near perfect matching and the @xmath1883 represents the single completing half - loop for @xmath1878 .",
    "coincidence is easily checked for all three models .",
    "we address the issue of simple word sum .",
    "the word sum for @xmath57 is the same as for @xmath29 . for @xmath65 , the technique of lemma  2.11 of @xcite reduces the matter to the irreducible eigenvalues of a vertex with @xmath0 half - loops ; since these eigenvalues are the eigenvalues of a @xmath1884 matrix which is @xmath214 on the diagonal and @xmath68 s elsewhere , the eigenvalues are @xmath580 with multiplicity @xmath68 and @xmath682 with multiplicity @xmath580 .",
    "hence the simple word sum of equation  ( [ eq : simple_word ] ) is given by @xmath1885 where @xmath977 are polynomials .",
    "for @xmath69 we can break the sum by how many half - loops are involved . for a fixed set of half - loops involved in the irreducible word , the sum is a convolution of functions of the form in equation  ( [ eq : matching_walk ] ) , which by theorem  [ th : baby_convolute ] is again super-@xmath0-ramanujan .",
    "we now establish expansion with error for the three models .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : probability ] ) has the @xmath57 analogue @xmath1886 now recall the proof of theorem  [ th : exp_polys ] , especially equations  ( [ eq : g_rational ] ) and ( [ eq : error_term ] ) . for @xmath57 , we have @xmath1887 @xmath1888 with @xmath631 as in equation  ( [ eq : g_rational ] ) with @xmath1889 being @xmath804 and @xmath1890 being the collection of the sequences @xmath1891 .",
    "hence for a walk of length at most @xmath97 we have @xmath1892 accordingly expansion with error holds for @xmath57 with expansion polynomials determined by equation  ( [ eq : chnd_form ] ) , and with error term bounded by @xmath1893 this bound is @xmath1894 for all @xmath1895 with @xmath1896 and @xmath1897 .    similarly for @xmath65",
    "we have the analogue @xmath1898 the analysis goes through essentially as before ; in the error bound we have @xmath803 is again @xmath805 , but this time the @xmath806 is as large as @xmath1899 ( taking one @xmath1900 and the rest @xmath214 ) .",
    "so expansion with error holds for @xmath65 with error term bounded by @xmath1901    for @xmath69 , consider a random @xmath68-regular graph , @xmath497 , consisting of a near perfect matching plus one complementing half - loop on the vertex set @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the number of such graphs is @xmath1902 .",
    "hence the probability of occurrence of a specified half - loop and @xmath1190 other matchings in @xmath497 is @xmath1903 and the probability of @xmath1190 specified matchings ( with no specified half - loop ) is @xmath1904 so for any specification of half - loops in @xmath338 , i.e. , any fixing of each @xmath1905 to @xmath214 or @xmath68 , @xmath1906 is a polynomial in the @xmath1907 s ; this makes @xmath1906 a polynomial in the @xmath1865 , namely @xmath1908 we also see that , in the terminology above , @xmath1909 and @xmath1910 .",
    "hence expansion with error holds for @xmath69 as well .",
    "this establishes the six required results mentioned at the beginning of this section for the models @xmath57 , @xmath65 , and @xmath69 .",
    "theorems  [ th : mainh ] and [ th : maini ] follow .",
    "we make a number of final remarks .    [ [ stronger - conjectures ] ] stronger conjectures : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as mentioned before , numerical experiments indicate that the average ( and median ) @xmath118 for a random graph is @xmath1911 , where @xmath44 is a negative function ( tending to @xmath214 as @xmath82 ) . by the results of friedman and kahale ( extending the alon - boppana result ) ,",
    "@xmath1912 ( see @xcite ) . however , the trace method , even with selective traces , seems to require some fundamental new idea in order to have any hope of achieving @xmath44 that is zero or negative .",
    "[ [ critical - d ] ] critical @xmath0 : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    as mentioned before , when there is a critical tangle of order strictly less than that of any hypercritical tangle , then our techniques leave a gap in that we can only prove @xmath299 with probability at least @xmath1913 where @xmath1914 .",
    "this case is extremely interesting , since it seems that there should be a theorem that closes this gap , and such a theorem would either get around a poorly bounded @xmath1915 or improve the very interesting theorem  [ th : remarkable ] ( or do something else ) .    [",
    "[ relative - alon - conjecture ] ] relative alon conjecture : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    following @xcite , it seems quite possible to relativize the main theorems in this paper .",
    "namely , fix a `` base '' graph , @xmath482 , ( or , more generally , a `` base '' pregraph , in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "fix an @xmath5 .",
    "then we believe that most random coverings of @xmath482 of degree @xmath16 have all `` new '' eigenvalue @xmath1916 , where @xmath249 is the spectral radius of the universal cover of @xmath482 .",
    "similarly , we can ask for @xmath1480 to be zero or even a negative function of @xmath16 . see @xcite for further discussion and a result in this direction .    [ [ alternate - proof - with - trace - see - the - end - of - section2 ] ] alternate proof with trace ( see the end of section  2 ) : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    it may be possible to analyze the expected irreducible trace over all of @xmath29 . as remarked in theorem  [ th : nottreelike ] and the discussion thereafter , the coefficients of @xmath1917 there could no longer be @xmath0-ramanujan",
    ". it may be possible to analyze selective traces without discarding contributions from tangled graphs .",
    "in other words , if we better understood how selectivity affected irreducible traces , we might not need section  9 ( and certain parts of our understanding of these traces might improve ) .",
    "clearly selectivity in @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of walks in an induced subgraph of a `` higher block presentation '' of @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
