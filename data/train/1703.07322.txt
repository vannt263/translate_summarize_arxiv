    "in fact , denoting the hamiltonian as @xmath364 we find that such a term grows under renormalization group arguments at large length scales or low energy ( see appendix c ) , and therefore the ground state will pin the field @xmath365 to one of the classical minima of the cosine potential , opening a mass term @xmath366 through this continuum description , the gap becomes equal on each bond since formally we have taken @xmath352 .",

    "this approach complements then the efforts at large @xmath285 presented above .    before addressing the case of doping the brickwall ladder with a pair of holes , we briefly comment on the case of square ladders , close to @xmath42 , which has been previously addressed in the literature ( see , for example , ref . ) .",

    "the rest of the description is unchanged since the bosonization continuum description assumes a vanishing lattice spacing and therefore the forms of @xmath363 and @xmath391 remain the same .",

    "in addition , @xmath395 becomes an irrelevant operator in the sense of the renormalization group and therefore should not affect ( deeply ) the fixed point .",
    "nevertheless , proceeding along the lines of ref . , then one can integrate out the antisymmetric mode @xmath116 at the fixed point exactly .",
    "this would only renormalize the luttinger parameter @xmath378 .",
    "we then conclude that the transition lines in the square ladder at small @xmath101 could also be described by a similar luttinger theory . starting from the @xmath8 phase of the sure ladder",

    "here , we study the effect of a few holes in the system starting from the gapless line of the brickwall ladder .    to study the motion of holes in the dilute limit , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we assume that the magnetic ground state @xmath294 at large @xmath285 ( related to eq .",
    "( 32 ) ) containing pre - formed pairs is not modified by the addition of a few holes .",
    "this means that the propagation of a few holes will be treated perturbatively , modifying only weakly the total energy of the system . using the properties of mott phases that spin-1/2 magnetizations",
    "are associated with electron spins , we introduce the electron creation and annihilation operators : @xmath396 these operators respectively create and annihilate a spin in the state @xmath397 on the site @xmath54 of the chain @xmath398 .",
    "the hopping of a hole from a site @xmath55 to the site @xmath54 is thus described by : @xmath399 we assume that double occupancy is suppressed on each site as a result of a large on - site hubbard repulsion , which has produced the mott phase , with one ( localized ) electron per site at half - filling ( or one spin-1/2 per site ) .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the motion of a hole along each chain then takes the form : @xmath400 where @xmath401 is the ( effective ) hopping amplitude along the chains .",
    "( in the regime studied below , two holes on a given rung will pair and therefore we do not need to introduce inter - chain hopping of single holes @xcite . )     -0.2 cm     we work in the dilute limit following ref . ,",
    "and therefore we neglect the hole correlation functions on different sites @xcite . formally ,",
    "in the limit of @xmath402 , the hole will preferably localize on a rung @xmath321 in fig .",
    "9 to minimize the magnetic exchange .",
    "indeed , the introduction of a hole is equivalent to suppress a spin-1/2 particle on a rung and therefore would increase the energy by an amount @xmath285 on a rung @xmath126 in fig .",
    "propagation of single holes have been addressed theoretically in two dimensions @xcite . here ,",

    "could then preferably tunnel from the rung @xmath321 to the rung @xmath406 or the rung @xmath407 .",
    "below , we address in contrast the propagation of two holes ( 2 spin vacancies ) or even number of holes in the dilute limit where @xmath42 is not so distinct from @xmath101 .",
    "this corresponds to situations with intermediate values of @xmath101 .",

    "iv.a .    in this limit , to minimize the magnetic energy ( see sec .",
    "iva ) , it is then favorable for two holes to form a pair on a rung @xmath54 where one hole localizes on the site @xmath54 of each chain .",
