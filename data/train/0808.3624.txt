    "since their inception in the early 1970 s , quantum field theories formulated on the lattice have been mapped to dual theories  models mathematically equivalent to the original formulation , but with different degrees of freedom . in many cases , configurations in the dual model can be interpreted as extended geometric structures such as closed sheets or self - avoiding polymers living on the space - time lattice  @xcite ; such structures can in turn be interpreted as histories of the physical degrees of freedom of the theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , the concept of dual methods as an alternative framework for computations in lattice gauge theory has seen a renewal of interest  @xcite .",
    "apart from the geometric insight provided by the dual theories and their use of gauge - invariant physical degrees of freedom , dual methods may provide a source of novel algorithms with attractive numerical performance in some regimes . from early work",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) it was found that abelian gauge theories are particularly tractable in their dual form .",
    "the abelian case was initially a source of many dual results and continues to provide a practical alternative to conventional numerical simulations  @xcite . with the above motivations in mind , we turn to the dual model of @xmath0 yang - mills theory on the four - dimensional lattice .",
    "this case is an important proving ground for the viability of dual non - abelian method , and one that has long been out of reach for practical calculations .    in analogy with dual abelian constructions , a dual formulation for pure non - abelian yang - mills lattice gauge theory ( lgt ) in four dimensions",
    "can be constructed from the character expansion of a local lattice action and has been known for decades ( e.g.  see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the nave application of character expansion leads to a non - local expression for the amplitude  a group integral over the entire lattice .",
    "it has since been realized by several authors that this group integral , which involves products of characters , can be expanded into intertwiner labellings at lattice edges , such that the dual amplitude becomes a product of amplitudes _ local _ in the plaquette and intertwiner labellings .",
    "following the description of an explicitly local amplitude in the case of @xmath4 and @xmath5 by anishetty _",
    "_ in  @xcite , halliday and suranyi observed in  @xcite that a local amplitude in four and higher dimensions can in principle be defined .",
    "however , a practical formula for the dual amplitude in @xmath6 ( analogous to that of  @xcite ) has proven more elusive .    recently , a systematic approach to non - abelian dual theories that emphasizes the underlying representation - theoretic structure has been developed starting with work by oeckl and pfeiffer  @xcite .",
    "these developments make use of the diagrammatic formalism to establish explicit representation - theoretic formulae for the local amplitudes that arise upon expanding in an intertwiner basis .",
    "it was demonstrated in  @xcite that numerical computations could be carried out for the dual form of lgt with @xmath5 on a cubic three - dimensional ( @xmath4 ) lattice .",
    "one major hurdle to extending the algorithm of  @xcite to @xmath6 is the problem of finding a closed - form formula for the vertex amplitude that can be evaluated efficiently on a computer and gives reasonable scaling with increasing spin labels .    in what follows , we present such an explicit and efficient evaluation of the vertex amplitude , a non - trivial function of 48 spin labels that dominates the computational costs of evaluating the dual amplitude in four dimensions .",
    "our implementation of this formula has been validated for a range of special cases ; currently , full monte carlo simulations using this amplitude are under way and will be described in an upcoming paper .",
    "the steps we shall use to find an explicit formula for the vertex amplitude are analogous to those described in  @xcite for the case of @xmath4 . for a hypercubic lattice @xmath7 in four dimensions , we write",
    "the integral of the six @xmath0 matrices sharing a given edge variable @xmath8 as follows : @xmath9{cables } } \\,\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath10 denote irreducible representations of @xmath0 , which we index by non - negative half - integers @xmath11 .",
    "the rhs of  ( [ eq : hidef ] ) is a projection map from the space of all linear maps @xmath12 onto the space of intertwiners ( maps commuting with the action of @xmath13 ) , and can thus be expanded using an orthogonal basis of intertwiners @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15{hproj } } \\int dg_e~\\raisebox{-1.45cm}{\\includegraphics[height=3.4cm]{cables } }       ~=~\\sum_i \\frac{i_i i^*_i}{\\langle i^*_i , i_i\\rangle }      ~=~\\sum_i          \\frac {              \\raisebox{-0.169cm}{\\includegraphics[height=2.60cm]{invvec } } ~~              \\includegraphics[height=2.4cm]{invdual }          } { \\raisebox{0cm}{\\includegraphics[height=2.2cm]{norm}}}.\\ ] ]    carrying out the contractions results in a spin foam model ( see , for example ,  @xcite for details ) , with the vertex amplitude defined as a spin network evaluation of the network shown in figure  [ fig:48j ] .    in drawing this figure , we have placed the vertex labelled @xmath16 `` at infinity '' .",
    "the edges of this network carry the irrep labels @xmath17 from the associated plaquettes meeting at the vertex and the vertices carry the intertwiner labels appearing in the expansion  ( [ eq : hiresolution ] ) , associated to the edges incident to the vertex .",
    "the orientations of the edges are determined from an orientation of the plaquettes in the lattice .",
    "we note in passing that this network has 24 edges and 8 vertices , and shares the same graph structure as a `` hyperoctahedron '' .",
    "to apply diagrammatic techniques leading to an explicit formula , our first task is to work with a diagram possessing 3-valent vertices , for which recoupling rules from  @xcite can be applied . a basis for the 6-valent intertwiners appearing in ( [ eq : hiresolution ] )",
    "can be readily chosen in terms of 3-valent networks having six edges entering or leaving ( see figure  [ fig : splitting ] ) .",
    "because three internal edges are required , the edges of the four - dimensional lattice will carry three half - integer spin labels , subject to some constraints .",
    "( in contrast , for the 4-valent vertices arising in @xmath4 , only a single label is required to define the intertwiner assigned to an edge . )    returning to the spin network that defines the vertex amplitude , we see that because each network vertex is associated with three spins , the vertex amplitude becomes a function of 48 spins in total ; 24 from the network edges ( coming from lattice plaquettes ) and 24 from the 8 network vertices ( 3 from each of the 8 lattice edges ) .",
    "thus , we shall refer to a vertex amplitude ( with its vertex splitting specified ) as a _",
    "@xmath18 symbol_. it should be noted that different patterns of splittings over the edges of the lattice can be chosen leading to numerically different vertex amplitudes .",
    "an important technical consideration is that the network resulting from an arbitrary splitting does not necessarily have translation symmetry over all the lattice vertices , as the splitting along one direction may not be related to the splitting in its opposite direction by a translation of the network .",
    "indeed , this is the case for the choice of splitting we will introduce below .",
    "however , a pattern of partial reflections leading to @xmath19 `` versions '' of the @xmath18 symbol can be repeated to fill a lattice . as the sixteen versions are related to each other by appropriate permutations of arguments , it is sufficient to work out a single case , which we shall by convention define to be the @xmath18 symbol at the origin .    in what follows",
    "we present the explicit evaluation of the @xmath18 symbol associated with a particular splitting ( choice of intertwiner basis ) that we give in the next section .",
    "we now specify the splitting we shall use for our 6-valent intertwiners .",
    "first we recall that a 3-valent intertwiner is uniquely determined up to a scale factor , and to fix conventions we use the intertwiners defined in  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : splitting ] shows a 6-valent intertwiner @xmath20 and its dual @xmath21 .        as the internal labels @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 vary , the intertwiners @xmath20 form an orthogonal basis of all 6-valent intertwiners , and these are the splittings used in our recoupling of the vertex amplitude below .",
    "observe here that the six incident edges are grouped into three pairs ; the choices we make are shown in figure  [ fig:48j_split ] ,     symbol in our choice of splitting . ]",
    "in which each 6-valent vertex has been replaced by an intertwiner @xmath20 as in figure  [ fig : splitting ] .",
    "the central vertex of @xmath20 is labelled with the same label as the original 6-valent vertex had .",
    "before we can apply recoupling rules to explicitly compute the vertex amplitude spin network , we must cast it into the form where the rules of  @xcite can be applied . to do this",
    "we follow the procedure described in appendix a of  @xcite , which relates the original spin network ( with oriented edges ) defining the @xmath18 symbol to a spin network in the sense of  @xcite ; although the two are equal in magnitude , in general there is a sign factor that depends on the spin arguments .    to determine the sign factor , we start by redrawing the network with all edges directed down the page , except for some edges which wrap around the right to the top of the page and contribute a sign factor . in doing this",
    ", the order of the edges incident on each vertex must be kept the same , but over - crossings and under - crossings can be reversed .",
    "such a mapping is presented in figure  [ fig : orderedmap ] .",
    "we first recall each line wrapping around contributes a sign factor of @xmath25 .",
    "we next observe that each intertwiner label that appears in the overall sign factor @xmath26 for a given vertex will also appear in the sign factor of the vertex on the other side of the edge .",
    "thus , globally these sign factors will cancel .",
    "because of this , we are free to `` drop the orientation '' of the original spin network and apply the rules of  @xcite and  @xcite , as was done in  @xcite .      referring to the splitting we have indicated in figure  [ fig:48j_split ] , we have drawn the diagram so as to make clear eight triangles , the edges of which are labelled by spins coming from plaquettes , and the vertices",
    "of which connect to edges carrying intertwiner labels .",
    "the next step in our recoupling procedure is to collapse each of these by applying the identity @xmath27{collapse}\\end{matrix } , \\label{eqn : collapse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which introduces the kauffman - lins tet symbol ( the square bracketed expression ) and theta network .",
    "note that  @xcite uses integer spins where we and  @xcite use half - integer spins . ]    after collapsing the triangles , the vertex amplitude @xmath28 is given by @xmath29= \\tau_{1 } \\tau_{2 } \\left ( \\prod_{n=1}^{8 } \\frac { \\left [   \\begin{array}{ccc } i_{a_{1}(n ) }    &   j_{b_{1}(n ) }   &   i_{e_{1}(n ) }   \\\\",

    "[ fig : recoupling1 ] it should be noted that , relative to figure  [ fig : orderedmap ] , two twists ( indicated by bars spanning twisted strands ) have been introduced , giving rise to associated sign factors @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see step 3 below for discussion ) .",
    "this was to put the diagram in a particular planar order so that the identity ( [ eqn : recouple ] ) defined in the next section below can be applied unambiguously .",
    "an interesting remark at this point is that the dependence on the 24 plaquette spins @xmath17 has been completely absorbed into the product of collapse factors in  ( [ eq : step2result ] ) ; the remaining spin network is purely a function of the 24 intertwiner labels .      in this step",
    "we transform the spin network @xmath30 into a ladder via a sequence of eight recoupling moves of the form @xmath33{recouple}\\end{matrix } , \\label{eqn : recouple}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "the moves are indicated in figure  [ fig : recoupling1 ] as follows .",
    "the eight edges to be recoupled are drawn as solid lines and labelled with letters from @xmath35 through @xmath36 .",
    "as given by  ( [ eqn : recouple ] ) , each of these moves leads to an auxiliary sum over an additional irrep label @xmath37 . upon applying the recoupling moves one arrives at the spin network shown in figure  [ fig : recoupling_final](a ) .    while these moves are sufficient to give a network having the topology of a ladder , there are a number of vertices at which `` twist moves '' have to be performed to arrive at a ladder without crossings .",

    "the eight intertwiners that labelled the edges @xmath35 through @xmath36 in figure  [ fig : recoupling1 ] , denoted @xmath47 in the recoupling move  ( [ eqn : recouple ] ) , appear as @xmath48 in  ( [ eqn : step2recouple ] ) .      here",
    "we apply the recoupling move to the eight `` rungs '' of the ladder .",
    "superficially , this leads to an additional eight auxiliary summations .",

    "having chosen the three - fold splitting described above for our intertwiners , we draw the edge amplitude evaluation as shown in figure  [ fig : edgenorm](a ) .",
    "as above , one can compute the sign relating the original network with directed edges to an undirected kauffman - lins spin network , and once again one finds that globally these signs cancel .",
    "the undirected spin network is shown in figure  [ fig : edgenorm](b ) and can be transformed into a theta network by collapsing the three bubbles according to the identity  ( [ eqn : bubble ] ) , as follows : @xmath66= \\frac{\\theta(j_4,j_1,i_2 ) \\theta(j_2,j_3,i_3 ) \\theta(j_6,j_5,i_1 ) } { \\delta_{i_1}\\delta_{i_2}\\delta_{i_3 } } \\theta(i_1,i_2,i_3).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 are the labels for the six plaquettes incident to an edge and @xmath67 are the three intertwiner labels .",
    "figure  [ fig : edgenorm ] also makes it clear that different intertwiners are orthogonal .",
    "the best comprehensive check for the validity of the amplitude derived above is a full simulation of the dual theory at increasingly large cut - offs .",
    "while this work is currently in progress , a more limited form of validation has been done . in the case where dual configurations are ensembles of closed , self - avoiding surfaces on the lattice",
    ", there is an explicit closed - form expression for the resulting amplitude related to the coloring of self - avoiding surfaces by irreps and their euler characteristic ; this formula is derived in  @xcite . to verify that the amplitude was correct for these configurations ,",
    "code was implemented to generate a range of such self - avoiding topologies ( corresponding topologically to 2-tori and 2-spheres ) and colorings . using an implementation of the vertex and edge amplitudes given above , the amplitudes of self - avoiding dual configurations were found to be in agreement with the closed form formula .",
    "we have presented an explicit formulation of pure yang - mills theory on a @xmath6 hypercubic lattice with @xmath5 .",
    "computationally , the critical part of the amplitude is the vertex amplitude , a function of 48 spins coming from the 24 plaquette labels and 24 intertwiner labels associated to a vertex . in a variety of special cases where a closed form formula was available , the amplitude was successfully verified .",
    "the first results of dual simulations using this amplitude will be reported on in forthcoming work by the first author .    while the vertex amplitude scales with @xmath1 rather than @xmath56 ( as in the @xmath4 case )",
    ", the achievable performance is sufficient to enable the first practical four - dimensional computations within the dual model .",
    "this is an important step in evaluating the feasibility of dual algorithms for non - abelian lgt as a possible alternative to conventional methods .",
    "we would also like to remark that the discovery of the original @xmath4 amplitude  @xcite prompted a number of intriguing analytic results .",
    "these include work by diakonov and petrov  @xcite revealing a gravitational interpretation to the dual degrees of freedom , as well as recent work by conrady  @xcite . with the present result , the way is now clear to establish analogous analytic results in @xmath6 . in particular , it will be interesting to see which results of the above work are specific to @xmath4 and which ideas can be extended @xmath6 .",
