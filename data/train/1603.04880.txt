    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are highly - dispersed radio transients emitting a radio flux density of @xmath4  jy for only a few milliseconds or less . since the first discovery reported in 2007 @xcite , more than 17 frbs @xcite have been discovered with the parkes radio telescope ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the arecibo observatory @xcite , and the green bank telescope @xcite .",
    "this population of frbs is highly inhomogeneous , with some showing high circular polarization @xcite , others showing high linear polarization @xcite , and others with little polarization @xcite .",
    "although most detected frbs are isolated events , one source has recently been found to be repeating @xcite .",
    "the origin of the frbs remains uncertain .",
    "their large dispersion measures , @xmath5  @xmath6pc , exceed expected values for propagation in the interstellar medium , suggesting that frbs are extragalactic at redshifts of @xmath7 .",
    "an extragalactic pulsed signal enables a direct probe of properties of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) through the cold plasma dispersion relationship , just as pulsars are used to probe the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) of the milky way .",
    "the short durations and extreme brightness temperatures of frbs suggest compact progenitors , such as the magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , neutron stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , white - dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the repeating frb is incompatible with the many proposed cataclysmic events .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter ) reported the discovery of a new frb ( frb150418 ) followed by a slower radio transient detected with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the radio light curves of this transient ( hereafter j0716 - 1900 ) at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz show rapid decay on timescales of @xmath16  d. optical observations with _",
    "subaru _ found that j0716 - 1900 is associated with the elliptical galaxy wise j071634.59 - 190039.2 at the redshift of 0.492@xmath80.008 .",
    "if this galaxy is indeed associated with frb150418 , then its identification provides the first measured redshift of a frb .",
    "the dispersion measure of the frb then provides an estimate of the density of the igm , in this case giving a value consistent with the standard @xmath9cdm cosmology .",
    "however , scintillation in the ionized interstellar medium can also introduce rapid variability of compact radio sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , pulsars and masers ( see ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , follow - up observations of j0716 - 1900 by @xcite detected rapidly varying flux density , with some measurements as high as the original detections by following the frb .",
    "moreover , because the line of sight to frb150418 lies close to the galactic plane ( galactic latitude @xmath10 ) , it has scattering that is significantly stronger than that at larger latitudes .",
    "consequently , as noted by , the effects of scintillation are significant for this frb and other nearby compact sources and must be considered as a potential source of the rapid variation seen in j0716 - 1900 .",
    "if the variation is indeed extrinsic , caused by scintillating emission from a compact galactic nucleus , then its association with frb150418 is likely spurious .    in this letter",
    ", we study the role of interstellar scintillation in the radio variability of j0716 - 1900 . in ",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we briefly introduce the theory of the interstellar scattering and give expected scattering properties along the line of sight to frb150418 . then , we present theoretical simulations based on these quantities in  [ sec:3 ] . finally , we discuss the role of continued follow - up observations of frb150418 and general considerations for follow - up of future frbs in ",
    "[ sec:4 ] . throughout the letter",
    ", we use a @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , providing the luminosity distance and linear scale of 2808  mpc and 6.1  pc mas@xmath14 for j0716 - 1900 , respectively .",
    "scattering of radio waves in the interstellar plasma arises from fluctuations in electron density .",
    "a variety of measurements find that the three - dimensional power spectrum @xmath15 of the density fluctuations corresponds to a turbulent cascade that is injected on scales of @xmath16  au and is dissipated on scales of @xmath17  km : @xmath18 , with @xmath19 close to the value of @xmath20 expected for kolmogorov turbulence @xcite . in many instances ,",
    "the scattering properties can be well described by a single , thin phase - changing screen @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a transverse coordinate on the screen .",
    "the statistical characteristics of the scattering and scintillation can then be related to statistical characteristics of the phase fluctuations through a spatial structure function @xmath23 ^ 2\\rangle_{{\\bf x_0}}$ ] .",
    "density fluctuations that follow the above power - law then give rise to a power - law structure function , @xmath24 .",
    "the properties of the scattering screen are characterized by a pair of length scales .",
    "the _ phase coherence length _ ( or diffractive scale ) , @xmath25 , decreases with increasing observing wavelength @xmath26 and determines the scale at which the screen phase decorrelates : @xmath27 . the _ fresnel scale _ ,",
    "@xmath28 , depends on the distance @xmath29 from the observer to the scattering screen and determines how the geometrical phase of propagation varies across the screen . for radio observations ,",
    "interstellar scattering is usually in the strong scattering regime , corresponding to the condition @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath31 ) , and a third scale becomes important : the _ refractive scale _ , @xmath32 , which determines the size of the scattered image of the point source .",
    "scintillation in strong scattering is dominated by two distinct branches , _ diffractive _ and _ refractive _ , on these widely separated scales .",
    "diffractive scintillation , arising from fluctuations on scales of @xmath33 , is quenched by a source exceeding the angular scale @xmath34 . as a result",
    ", diffractive scintillation is typically quenched by agn .",
    "refractive scintillation arises from fluctuations on scales of @xmath35 and is only quenched by a source exceeding the angular scale @xmath36 so can persist for compact agn . with the characteristic transverse velocity of the scattering material @xmath37 , the _ diffractive _ and _ refractive timescales _ are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for pulsars , @xmath40  cm  s@xmath14 is typical ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is typically dominated by proper motion of the pulsar . for an extragalactic source ,",
    "the velocity is determined by a combination of motion of the earth and of the scattering material , and we adopt a characteristic velocity of @xmath41  cm  s@xmath14 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the flux variability due to the scattering effects is often quantified with the _ modulation index _",
    ", defined by @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the flux density . for refractive scintillation ,",
    "the modulation index for a source with angular size @xmath44 smaller than @xmath45 ( i.e. , the refractive scale ) is @xmath46 , where the precise prefactor is of order unity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "larger sources suppress the modulation index by a factor of @xmath47 , where @xmath44 is the unscattered source size .",

    "for this model , the expected fwmh scattering size along the line of sight to j0716 - 1900 at 1  ghz is @xmath62  mas . due to its low galactic latitude ,",
    "this value is significantly higher than the median angular broadening at 1  ghz ( @xmath63 ) . leaving @xmath64 as a free parameter to provide formulas that are applicable to arbitrary lines of sight ( but referencing to our assumed value for j0716 - 1900 ) , other scattering parameters",
    "can then be estimated as follows : @xmath65 in table [ tab : prm ] , we give characteristic quantities for a screen at @xmath66  kpc at 1 , 5.5 and 7.5  ghz with a power - law index of @xmath67 .",
    "we emphasize that these results are only appropriate in the strong - scattering regime , so for j0716 - 1900 they are applicable at frequencies below @xmath68 .",
    "this weak / strong transition frequency is much higher than that of most lines of sight because of the low galactic latitude of j0716 - 1900 .",
    "the most important implication from table [ tab : prm ] is that j0716 - 1900 can be highly affected by refractive scattering at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz , if the source is more compact than @xmath69  mas ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath70  pc at the redshift of @xmath2 ) .",
    "this upper - limit is reasonable for the radio core of a relativistic jet ( e.g. , as has been seen directly with space vlbi ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that recent vlbi surveys have shown that fainter sources are more likely to be dominated by compact components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and preliminary results of vlbi observations show that j0716 - 1900 is unresolved on milliarcsecond scales @xcite .",
    "refractive scattering would then cause modulation of @xmath71 on a timescale of a few days , similar to what has been observed ( see figure  [ fig : lc1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite have also obtained a similar conclusion .",
    "thus , in addition to the importance of scintillation for the radio variability a compact afterglow , as noted by , refractive scintillation is also a critical consideration even for compact emission from an agn , and the radio variability of j0716 - 1900 is comparable to the expected refractive scintillation in the ism . note also that the pulse broadening due to the interstellar scintillation is only @xmath10.02  ms at 1  ghz , which is much shorter than the observed pulse duration of @xmath72  ms for frb150418 .",
    "to further study the radio - flux variation caused by the interstellar scintillation and understand how the variations may be correlated at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz , we performed numerical simulations of the scattering of j0716 - 1900 .",
    "following @xcite , we generated scattered images at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz for an intrinsic source that was a circular gaussian with a full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) size of 0.1  mas .",
    "we generated a scattering screen with @xmath73 random phases with the characteristic scattering parameters given in table  [ tab : prm ] .",
    "our simulations span 1207  d ( @xmath1 300 - 600  @xmath74 ) with a time resolution of 0.27  d ( @xmath75 @xmath74 ) .",
    "to investigate the variability statistics , we also generated @xmath76 different scattering realizations , providing a total span of @xmath77 d. we show example images of the scattered structure for one realization of the scattering in fig .",
    "[ fig : images ] .",
    "we calculated the total flux density of each scattered image at each time to generate a light curve for each frequency .        in figure",
    "[ fig : lc1 ] , we show simulated light curves at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz , and in figure  [ fig : lc2 ] we show the probability distribution for the simulated light curves .",
    "the light curves exhibit the expected fast variability discussed in  [ subsec : prm ] .",
    "the modulation index is @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the whole data at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz , respectively , consistent with the original observations of the atca and also with the follow - up observations with the very large array ( vla ) @xcite . for direct comparison with these observations ,",
    "we also compare light curves for 400 d with the normalized light curve of , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : lc1](b ) .",
    "the simulated light curves vary on scales of @xmath80  d , consistent with all observations , and have highly correlated variability at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz , again consistent with the synchronized flux variation reported by .",
    "refractive scintillation can also explain the gentle spectral modulation across 2 - 18  ghz reported by @xcite .",
    "we have shown that refractive scattering can potentially explain the amplitude and timescale of the radio variations of j0716 - 1900 .",
    "this explanation requires that the source is sufficiently compact , most plausibly a weak , radio - loud agn .",
    "this explanation is consistent with preliminary results of vlbi observations @xcite . here ,",
    "we briefly discuss expected observational properties for this scenario .",
    "the typical flux density of @xmath81  mjy of j0716 - 1900 corresponds to the radio power of @xmath82 this power is consistent with the typical nuclear radio power of the nearby low luminosity agns ( llagn ) and elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are thought to be powered by a hot accretion flow ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or a faint jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this radio power is also consistent with the low - power end of the known blazars @xcite .    to avoid quenching the refractive scintillation ,",
    "the source angular size must subtend @xmath83  mas , providing a lower limit on its brightness temperature : @xmath84 the lower limit of the brightness temperature is compatible with low - power radio galaxies and blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , in addition to the source size , the radio power and the brightness temperature are also reasonable as nuclear emission from a llagn , low - powered blazar , or weak agn .",
    "we note that @xcite have very recently measured a flat radio spectrum for j0716 - 1900 , which is generally seen in blazars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the flat radio spectrum suggests that the majority of the arcsecond - scale flux density originates in the optically - thick radio core emission , which could be sufficiently compact to be scintillating , and other observations have revealed the presence of compact jet structure in elliptical galaxies without any feature of agn in the optical / infrared spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the radio spectrum supports the scenario in which the variability j0716 - 1900 is predominantly from interstellar scintillation .",
    "@xcite were the first to argue that the radio emission from j0716 - 1900 arises from an agn and have noted that the observed variability is incompatible with standard afterglow evolution .",
    "based on the deep vla imaging study of @xcite at 5  ghz , @xcite further note that @xmath85 sources above @xmath86 are expected per parkes beam .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that most sources between @xmath87 were unresolved ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "these estimates are then favorable for ascribing the variability of j0716 - 1900 to refractive scintillation .",
    "however , we caution that the variability of j0716 - 1900 should not be directly compared with variability reported in other surveys at these frequencies because its line of sight is close to the galactic plane and so has significantly stronger scattering than the median galactic values .",
    "consequently , the transition to weak scattering , where the refractive modulation index @xmath61 peaks , is at higher frequencies for j0716 - 1900 than for higher - latitude sources .",
    "in short , the fast variation of j0716 - 1900 can be reasonably explained as refractive scintillation in the ism and may not represent an afterglow associated with frb150418 .",
    "both the analytical theory of refractive scattering and our numerical simulations show that the expected scattering of j0716 - 1900 can reproduce the observed timescales and modulation index at 5.5 and 7.5  ghz .",
    "they also naturally explain the synchronized modulation at these frequencies and the gentle modulation across the wider radio spectrum reported by @xcite .",
    "refractive scintillation requires that the source size is smaller than @xmath89  mas ( @xmath90  pc at the source ) , which is consistent with preliminary results of vlbi observations @xcite .",
    "this source size corresponds to a brightness temperature @xmath91 , compatible with llagn and faint blazars .",
    "our results would also apply to more compact emission , such as an frb afterglow , and demonstrate that fast variability does _ not _ necessitate a high doppler factor .",
    "our estimates of the scattering are not sensitive to assumptions about the location of the scattering screen , but our derived timescales are uncertain by a factor of several , both from the unknown velocity of the scattering material and the unknown distance of the scattering from the earth .",
    "also , our estimates of the scattering of j0716 - 1900 ( from the ne2001 model ) are uncertain by a factor of several .",
    "finally , refractive scintillation can only cause the observed flux variability if the majority of the source flux originates in the compact core emission .",
    "the core dominance of j0716 - 1900 is therefore one of the key questions for continued studies and can be confirmed using vlbi . even with these cautions and remaining uncertainties ,",
    "it is evident that refractive scintillation is of fundamental importance for the interpretation of j0716 - 1900 and for radio identification of frb afterglows more generally .",
