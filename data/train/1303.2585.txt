    "due to the random character of muon implantation , the amplitudes of the different types of precession signals are proportional to the volume fraction of the respective environments .",

    "typical asymmetry spectra for the @xmath53 case , collected at two selected temperatures in the forward - backward ( f - b ) detectors with a nonrotated muon spin , are shown in figure  [ fig : asym10_nsr ] .",
    "one can distinguish two different temperature regimes : in the low - temperature regime ( @xmath54 k ) clear oscillations with a rather high damping rate are observed , demonstrating that the sample has made a transition to a magnetically ordered state characterized by long - range order . here the oscillating signal is superimposed to a slowly decaying exponential relaxation , observable only at longer times ( not shown ) . above @xmath30 , instead , the amplitude of the oscillating signal goes abruptly to zero , leaving only two slow but distinct exponential relaxations . to follow the above evolution across the whole temperature range , all data sets were fitted to the function : @xmath55 here the transverse component , characterized by an amplitude @xmath56 and a damping rate @xmath57 , is an oscillating function @xmath58 , with @xmath40 the zeroth - order bessel function , @xmath59 the magnitude of the internal magnetic field , and @xmath60 mhz / t the muon s gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the longitudinal component was fitted to a relaxing lorentzian term , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath10s@xmath63 , the initial amplitude and relaxation rate , respectively , while @xmath64 is a temperature - independent relaxing background term that could be ascribed to a non negligible volume fraction that remains paramagnetic even at low temperatures ( as inferred also from tf-@xmath10sr data  see previous section and table  [ tab : magnprop ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the highly damped oscillation found at short times below @xmath30 in the @xmath5 sample could be fitted satisfactorily using either a cosine term or a bessel function . despite the long data - acquisition times , the collected statistics was still not high enough to clearly distinguish between these two cases .",
    "consequently , although we can safely state that the system shows a long - range magnetic order , not much can be said about the commensurability of the order @xcite . by taking into account the whole @xmath10sr data set and the theoretical predictions on the muon implantation sites ( _ vide infra _ ) , for the @xmath65 case ( pure fete ) we privilege the fit results where the oscillating term was fitted with a zeroth - order bessel function .",

    "these field values lie in the range 50 to 150 mt ( left scale in figure  [ fig : bint ] ) .      in order to study the direction of the internal magnetic field @xmath59 in the differently doped samples we take advantage of the zf-@xmath10sr as a non - perturbing technique ( no applied external field ) . to simplify the interpretation of the results we consider here the case when the initial muon - spin polarization is antiparallel to the beam direction and systematically compare the data collected by the f - b with those of the u - d detectors ( see figure  [ fig : geom ] ) .",
    "we recall that each investigated sample consists of a mosaic of single crystals from the same batch , positioned so that their @xmath74 surfaces coincide with the @xmath75 plane ( i.e.  orthogonal to the muon spin ) , as shown schematically in figure  [ fig : geom ] .",

    "these features indicates that the internal magnetic field @xmath72 , as probed by the implanted muons , can be exclusively either in the @xmath74 plane or orthogonal to it ( i.e.  not in some arbitrary out - of - plane direction ) . now ,",
    "if the internal magnetic field @xmath59 were parallel to the crystal @xmath29-axis , we would expect the asymmetry measured by the u - d and f - b detector pairs to be equal to zero and to a constant value , respectively . since this is not the case ,",
    "we conclude that the direction of the internal field lies necessarily in the laboratory @xmath75 plane , i.e.  in the sample s @xmath74 plane .",

    "+ _ dc magnetization _ : as a general feature , the investigated samples display a complex magnetic behaviour .",
    "first , all the samples with @xmath83 are superconductors , whose @xmath84 and shielding fraction scale with @xmath4 .",
    "since the normalized sc shielding is always far away from the ideal value @xmath17 , even for the sample with the highest se content , this suggests that superconductivity has not a bulk character .",
    "second , @xmath85 curves taken at 200 mt ( large enough to destroy a weak superconductivity ) exhibit a pronounced hysteresis , with irreversibility temperatures @xmath18 that decrease both with increasing se content ( instead of being independent of it , as previously reported , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and with the applied field ( not shown ) . in particular , the field dependence of @xmath18 is generally ascribed to the presence of a spin glass phase @xcite .",
    "such a hysteretic behaviour most likely originates from the competition between the antiferromagnetic _ intra_-cluster and the ferromagnetic _ inter_-cluster interactions .",
    "it suggests the lack of a true long - range magnetic order @xcite , as confirmed also by our zf-@xmath10sr experimental results ( _ vide infra _ ) .",
    "further insight on the glassy magnetic behaviour is obtained from the isothermal magnetization curves taken below and above the respective antiferromagnetic transitions ( see figure  [ fig : hyst ] ) .",
    "the low temperature data show two noteworthy features : _ i _ ) for @xmath86 the first magnetization curve is compatible with the presence of a small superconducting phase .",
    "_ ii _ ) the hysteresis cycles consist of a complicated superposition of weak superconductivity ( for @xmath83 ) and a glassy magnetic state , that give rise to characteristic `` _ _ s__-shaped '' @xmath87 profiles @xcite .",
    "this feature becomes more prominent at a higher se content , whereas it seems hidden in the @xmath53 sample .",

    "the maximum of @xmath22 , observed at freezing temperatures @xmath8815  k for frequencies @xmath8910  khz , represents the point where the system s relaxation time @xmath90 equals the characteristic time scale of the ac measurement , @xmath91 .",
    "the ac magnetic response becomes frequency - independent only above that maximum , a behaviour peculiar of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23 value determined from the @xmath22 maximum is in very good agreement with the @xmath18 value extracted from the dc - magnetization fc - zfc irreversibility curves at 200 mt ( see figure  [ fig : dcmagn ] ) .",
    "we notice also that the peak position , @xmath23 , shifts to higher temperatures with increasing frequency , yet another characteristic of spin glasses or superparamagnetic states .",
    "in fact , in these systems the relative freezing temperature variation , @xmath92 , scales proportionally with the logarithmic frequency variation of the excitation frequency @xmath93 @xcite : @xmath94 the scaling parameter , @xmath95 , usually lies between 0.005 and 0.06 in case of spin glasses , while it exceeds 0.1 in superparamagnets with noninteracting spin clusters .",
    "as shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : acmagn ] , the fit of experimental data provides @xmath96 , a value close to those found in other spin - glass / cluster - glass systems @xcite .",
    "this rules out any possible superparamagnetic state and represents strong evidence about spin - glass behaviour in the fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2  family .",
    "+ _ muon spectroscopy _ : the low - temperature , short - time asymmetry data for @xmath97 show a coherent muon - spin precession successfully fitted by a @xmath40 term .",
    "this feature is generally ascribed to the onset of a long - range afm order , although somehow weakened by the incommensurate character of the magnetic structure @xcite or , more simply , by the presence of magnetic clusters @xcite . in principle , our findings are in agreement with previous neutron diffraction @xcite and @xmath10sr measurement @xcite data , both suggesting a long - range afm magnetic order . however , the more marked manifestations of a disordered magnetism in our case , lead us to associate the bessel term of the fits with a generic medium - to - short range magnetism , as is the case of glassy magnetic phases .",
    "indeed , the presence of large magnetic clusters has been invoked to explain the damped oscillations observed in certain conventional spin - glass systems @xcite .",
    "this picture most likely applies whenever sufficiently big magnetic clusters can cause both coherent muon precessions , and give rise to a glassy magnetic hysteresis in the dc magnetization data . as the se content",
    "is further increased beyond @xmath98 , there is a progressive loss of muon - spin polarization , reflected in an enhanced damping of the oscillating signal , which evidences a transition to a pure short - range magnetic order @xcite .",

    "indeed , the typical features expected in a classical spin - glass phase ( such as , e.g. , the bifurcation in dc magnetization ) are present in all of them , but they are most pronounced in the @xmath20 case , which fulfills at best the criteria defining the spin - glass state ( see also figs .",
    "[ fig : acmagn ] and [ fig : hyst ] ) . in this sense , by considering only dc magnetization data , our results fully agree with the phase diagram reported in ref .",

    "the difficulty in unambiguously defining the spin - glass state in fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2  is most likely due to the presence of local structural , chemical and electronic inhomogeneities , intrinsic to this class of materials @xcite . as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : field_direction ] , our experimental data suggest that the internal magnetic field , as sensed by the precessing muons , lies in a plane parallel to the iron layers . to better appreciate the implications of this finding we tried to determine the muon - stopping site(s ) by investigating an ideal stoichiometric fete crystal with the density functional theory ( dft ) formalism in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) @xcite .",

    "the resulting isosurfaces for @xmath110 are presented in figure  [ fig : muon_isosurfaces ] .",

    "the dominant @xmath118 term at the muon - stopping site was calculated by means of the probability density obtained from the ahw ground - state wavefuction . by considering the ordered configuration of fe(i ) magnetic moments ( each carrying 2.54 @xmath106 , as from neutron powder diffraction on fe@xmath0te polycrystalline samples ) @xcite",
    ", the expected dipolar field at the muon implantation sites is @xmath120  mt . the latter result is in good agreement with @xmath121  mt , the value obtained from zf-@xmath10sr data .",
    "the residual discrepancy can be attributed to a possible small contribution arising from the fermi - contact term , that was neglected in a first instance .",
    "we recall here that the excess of iron ( present in all samples ) is strongly magnetic @xcite and may play an important role in broadening the local field distribution . moreover , as shown in figure  [ fig : bint ] , the low - temperature field value at a muon site , @xmath59 , decreases slightly with increasing se content .",
    "provided the hyperfine coupling tensor does not depend ( or depends only weakly ) on se content , this would imply that the magnetic moment of the iron ions does the same , in apparent contrast with neutron powder diffraction results @xcite .",
    "+   + finally , we recall that exafs@xcite , stem and eels @xcite results , previously mentioned in the introduction , bring strong and clear evidence about local structural inhomogeneities , nanometer - scale phase separation and chemical inhomogeneities on _ crystallographically homogeneous",
    "_ fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2samples .",
    "these important findings let us unify our experimental results into a coherent picture .",
    "since x - ray diffraction measurements evidence that our samples are in a single phase @xcite , the above mentioned nanoscale phase separation scenario would imply : _ i _ ) the formation of magnetic clusters , hence justifying the glassy behaviour evidenced by both ac / dc magnetometry and muon spectroscopy data .",
    "this same glassy behaviour could potentially attenuate , or even mask , the true variation of the fe magnetic moment with se / te substitution .",
    "_ ii _ ) the presence of a non negligible volume fraction that stays in the paramagnetic state also at low temperatures . in our case , this fraction represents ca .",
    "2030% of the sample volume and is mostly se - independent .",
    "_ iii _ ) the absence of any possible nanoscopic - like m - sc coexistence , rather common instead in the 1111 pnictide family @xcite .",
    "the latter can be ruled out because none of the investigated sc samples shows bulk superconductivity . in particular , this seems to be a general feature of the iron chalcogenide family that confirms _ a posteriori _ previous muon spectroscopy and neutron diffraction results on fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2  single crystals @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature antiferromagnetic order in an extended series of fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2  single crystals was studied by means of ac / dc magnetometry and by muon - spin spectroscopy .",
    "muons are most likely implanted close to a fe(ii ) site , where they sense a local magnetic field @xmath122  mt , lying in the @xmath74 plane . at low se content",
    "@xmath10sr detects a medium / long range af order that progressively weakens with se substitution and , for @xmath123 , turns into a short - range order .",
    "both ac and dc magnetometry data on the same samples show clear evidence about a magnetic glassy phase , which becomes more prominent for @xmath20 , but vanishes at higher se content .",
    "the magnetometry results , combined with the unusually highly - damped zf-@xmath10sr oscillations , observed in the same temperature range where the glassy behaviour occurs , suggest that the system is most likely in a _ magnetic cluster - glass state _ , probably induced by the nanometer - scale phase separation and the chemical inhomogeneity .",
    "the last feature seems to be an intrinsic property of the fe@xmath0se@xmath1te@xmath2  family , as confirmed also by recent extensive studies on polycrystalline fese@xmath124te@xmath124 @xcite .",

    "the vertical arrows indicate the onset of superconductivity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the @xmath10sr measurement of single crystals with a typical size of @xmath125 mm@xmath126 and 0.10.3 mm thickness was made possible by using a standard `` mosaic technique '' .",
    "several crystals from the same batch were sticked close together using an aluminated mylar tape .",
    "the resulting mosaic was then centred on a standard aluminium fork sample holder suited for muon fly - past measurements .",
    "for all the investigated samples the effective sample area exposed to the beam was never below 25 mm@xmath126 .",
    "taking into account the relatively large sample thickness ( @xmath127 mm ) and the average sample density , a 0.6 mm thick kapton mask was sufficient to ensure that the majority of the incoming muons were implanted into the sample volume .",
    "the further use of veto counting ( which accounts for only those muons effectively stopped in the sample ) , contributed also to a significantly improved signal - to - noise ratio . in this configuration a total asymmetry in the range 0.150.22 could be obtained , still low if compared with the normal asymmetry value expected at the gps instrument ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "the discrepancy could be ascribed to muonium ( or muonated radical ) formation in the kapton mask with a relatively high hyperfine coupling constant . since the ensuing muon - spin depolarization reduces only the total signal asymmetry , but does not otherwise affect the measured signal , we could safely ignore the fraction of muons being stopped in the kapton frame .",
