    "let @xmath1 be a locally compact group .",
    "an important notion in representation theory is that of a _",
    "model_. broadly speaking , a model is a representation space of @xmath1 ( usually defined geometrically ) which contains any irreducible constituent with multiplicity one .",
    "consider the case where @xmath1 is the @xmath0-points of a reductive group @xmath2 defined over a local field @xmath0 .",
    "there are many examples of models which are realized on induces spaces @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a character of a closed subgroup @xmath5 of @xmath1  i.e. , on the space of smooth functions on @xmath1 which are left @xmath6-equivariant with the right @xmath1-action .",
    "( for simplicity we assume that @xmath5 is unimodular . ) in this case we say that the pair @xmath6 satisfies multiplicity one .",
    "the representations which occur in this model are called distinguished by @xmath6 .",
    "they are characterized by the property that there exists a non - zero functional on them which is @xmath6-equivariant .",
    "if @xmath7 is such a representation then we denote by @xmath8 its realization in the model .",
    "the most well - known case is the _ whittaker model _ in which @xmath1 is quasi - split , @xmath5 is a maximal unipotent subgroup and @xmath4 is a non - degenreate character of @xmath5 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of the whittaker model in representations theory and automorphic forms can not be overestimated . for other instances of models , including recent progress cf .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the following question .",
    "let @xmath1 be a reductive group defined over a @xmath9-adic @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 two closed subgroups of @xmath1 defined over @xmath0 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 characters of @xmath14 .",
    "suppose that @xmath15 , @xmath13 satisfy multiplicity one and let @xmath7 be an irreducible representation of @xmath1 which is distinguished by both @xmath15 , @xmath13 .",
    "then up to a scalar there is a unique isomorphism @xmath16 can one explicate such an isomorphism , as well as its inverse ?",
    "more precisely , can one find a @xmath1-equivariant integral transform from @xmath17 to @xmath18 with an explicit inversion formula ?",
    "the question is meaningful for any irreducible representation @xmath7 of @xmath1 such that @xmath19 ( whether or not @xmath20 or @xmath21 satisfy multiplicity one in general ) .",
    "we will call such an explicit map @xmath22 a _ model transition_. assume for simplicity that @xmath23 and @xmath24 coincide on @xmath25 . a first attempt would be to consider the map @xmath26 which _ formally _ defines an intertwining operator @xmath27 .",
    "( often , this integral needs to be regularized . )",
    "it turns out however that it is sometimes advantageous to replace the domain of integration by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a proper subgroup of @xmath11 containing @xmath25 .",
    "( this reflects the fact that we secretly work within a subgroup @xmath30 of @xmath1 containing @xmath10 and consider maps @xmath31 . )",
    "of course this procedure does not give rise to a map from @xmath32 ( or a suitable @xmath1-invariant subspace @xmath33 where the regularized integral is defined ) to @xmath34 .",
    "however , one can hope that in certain cases for ( suitable ) @xmath20-distinguished representations @xmath7 we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we will give several examples of this phenomenon .",
    "the first example is for the group @xmath37 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a tempered representation @xmath7 of @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , @xmath7 has a whittaker model @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the subgroup of upper unitriangular matrices in @xmath38 and @xmath41 a non - degenerate character of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the centralizer of @xmath43 in @xmath38 , isomorphic to @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 has a model @xmath45 with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "( it is known that , for any @xmath7 , this model is unique if it exists @xcite . )",
    "note that the character @xmath41 is trivial on @xmath46 .",
    "in one direction we define @xmath47 by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the mirabolic subgroup of @xmath38 .",
    "the integral converges absolutely ( even if @xmath7 is only assumed to be unitarizable and generic ) .",
    "moreover , it is known that the image of @xmath50 indeed lies in @xmath45 @xcite . in the other direction when @xmath7 is tempered , define @xmath51 by @xmath52 the meaning of the regularized integral ( in a more general context ) will be explained in  [ sec : stable ] .",
    "it is a slight extension of the stable integrals studied in @xcite .",
    "we show that the maps @xmath50 and @xmath53are inverse to each other ( proposition [ prop : inversionm ] ) .",
    "this result is a version of local rankin ",
    "selberg unfolding .",
    "it is closely related to the material of @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a similar result in a different setup .",
    "an immediate consequence is that we can define @xmath50 with respect to the other mirabolic subgroup without changing the result ( see proposition  [ prop : sametran ] which is analogous to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 7.2 ) ) .",
    "next , we will ` inflate ' the @xmath54 result to the group @xmath55 ( a subgroup of @xmath56 of rank @xmath57 ) .",
    "we identify @xmath38 with the levi subgroup of the siegel parabolic subgroup @xmath58 of @xmath1 via @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 be the subgroup of upper unitriangular matrices in @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the centralizer of @xmath61 in @xmath1 ; it is isomorphic to @xmath62 .    with @xmath7 as before , consider the induced representation @xmath63 realized on the space of smooth functions @xmath64 such that for all @xmath65 the function @xmath66 on @xmath38 belongs to @xmath39 .",
    "the representation @xmath67 admits a unique irreducible quotient ( the langlands quotient ) which we denote by @xmath68 . the representation @xmath68 has a unique model @xmath69 ( theorem [ thm : mwl ] ) .",
    "meanwhile let @xmath70 be the extension @xmath41 to @xmath60 , trivial on @xmath71 .",
    "then @xmath68 has also a unique model @xmath72 ( proposition [ prop : tadic ] ) .",

    "we define @xmath78 by @xmath79 once again the regularized integral is defined in  [ sec : stable ] .",
    "we show that @xmath80 defines a model transition from @xmath72 to @xmath69 , whose inverse is @xmath81 ( theorem [ thm : mwl ] ) . in particular ,",
    "the integral defining @xmath80 is an @xmath5-invariant functional .",
    "note that in general @xmath82 is finite - dimensional ( but not necessarily zero or one - dimensional ) if @xmath83 is an irreducible representation of @xmath1 .",
    "( we do not know whether @xmath84 for all @xmath83 . )",
    "one can also realize @xmath69 by the map @xmath85 given by the absolutely convergent integral @xmath86 we have the following commutative diagram ( proposition [ p : l ] ) : +    i(,12 ) & ^(h,1 ) ( ) + & ^(n,_n ) ( )     + where @xmath87 is the standard epsilon factor @xmath88 ( which does not depend on @xmath89 since @xmath7 has a trivial central character ) .",
    "this leads us to the second theme of this paper which is the compatibility of model transitions .",
    "more precisely , given three models with respect to pairs @xmath15 , @xmath90 with transition maps we will be interested in the commutativity of the diagram +    ^(h_1,_1 ) & & ^(h_2,_2 ) + & ^(h_3,_2 ) &    we will study this question for the representations @xmath68 above .",

    ". see proposition [ prop : main ] for the precise statement .",
    "the main tool for proving the results is repeated applications of fourier inversion ( see appendix [ a : int ] ) .",
    "this idea is of course not new .",

    "soudry @xcite .",
    "in fact , this paper owes a lot to their work .",
    "our point of view however is slightly different as we are interested in explicit computations in the various models .",

    "reznikov @xcite for a closely related theme .",
    "the integral transforms @xmath108 and @xmath109 are related by conjugation by a certain element of the normalizer of @xmath5 ( see  [ sec : etwon ] ) .",
    "it follows from the above diagram that on @xmath72 , there is a functional equation relating the integral transforms @xmath110 and @xmath105 .",
    "a version of this functional equation is stated in corollary  [ cor : fornextpaper ] .",
    "the results of this paper will be used in our work on whittaker - fourier coefficients of automorphic forms on the metaplectic double cover of @xmath111 .",
    "more precisely , the results ( and their variants proved in  [ sec : mfactor ] ) will be used in proving a conjectural local identity stated in @xcite .",
