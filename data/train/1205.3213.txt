    "previous work by grinstein , oconnell , and wise  @xcite , repurposing the seminal work of lee and wick ( lw )  @xcite , has demonstrated the effectiveness of introducing negative - norm states to cancel the quadratic divergences endemic to the standard model ( sm ) . in this formulation ,",
    "the lw states amount to the additional solutions of a higher - derivative ( hd ) field equation possessing two poles in its feynman propagator . starting with @xmath3 one obtains @xmath4 which scales as @xmath5 at high energies , thereby improving the convergence of feynman diagrams in the hd formulation of the theory . for @xmath6 , the field @xmath7 has poles at @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can perform an auxiliary field redefinition to split the single field @xmath7 into two fields , one of positive and one of negative norm : @xmath10 which becomes exact in the limit @xmath11 .",
    "it was also shown in  @xcite that the heavy lw fields have the interesting property of possessing negative decay widths , a feature that figures prominently in the remainder of this work .",
    "the primary theoretical motivation to study the lwsm is rooted in the resolution of the hierarchy problem provided by higher - derivative lagrangians .",
    "the level of attractiveness of this solution relies upon whether these heavy lw states can be definitively observed at colliders using present experimental capabilities ( _ i.e. _ , the lhc ) .",
    "this line of research was initially conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the author analyzed , among other processes , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 refers to either a sm or lw virtual gauge boson , and a lw mass of 1.5  tev was assumed .",
    "however , analyses of electroweak parameters carried out in succession of improvements  @xcite ( by scanning the lw parameter space in  @xcite ; by including only lw masses for the fields most important for the hierarchy problem  @xcite ; by using not just oblique parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 , but also the `` post - lep '' parameters @xmath1 , @xmath16  @xcite ; by including bounds from the @xmath17 direct correction  @xcite ) reach the consensus conclusion that the lw @xmath1 mass must be at least @xmath18  tev in order to maintain consistency with current electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) , and even then only at the price of making lw fermion masses substantially higher ( as much as 10  tev , according to the same references ) . more generic scenarios , in which all lw particles have comparable masses , have typical bounds of @xmath19  tev , which not only places experimental signals out of reach for the lhc , but also diminishes the value of lw states for providing a natural hierarchy problem resolution .",
    "nevertheless , significant work on the phenomenology of the lwsm at the lhc has been carried out in a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "however , the conventional lw approach studied to date provides only the first nontrivial example in a series of higher - derivative theories with an increasing number @xmath20 of propagator poles . naming the original theory @xmath21 and the conventional lw theory @xmath22",
    ", one may generate an @xmath23 theory  @xcite , or any higher @xmath20 , each of which resolves the hierarchy problem .",
    "in particular , the lagrangian for the scalar @xmath23 theory reads @xmath24 which gives rise to the propagator @xmath25 for @xmath26 , this theory exhibits three well - separated poles , in analogy to the @xmath22 case discussed above .",
    "however , when one performs successive auxiliary field transformations to the original hd lagrangian , the new state so obtained is a heavy _ positive_-norm field , with a positive decay width just like its sm partner .",
    "work underway  @xcite shows that this crucial alternation of norm provides a substantial cancellation of the complete lw contribution to the ewpt , and therefore significantly relaxes the bounds on the lw masses ; however , in anticipation of the results of this detailed analysis , we consider here as a first step whether the lw states themselves are easily discernible in realistic lhc data , and whether they are easily distinguishable from other beyond - sm ( bsm ) scenarios .",
    "this work therefore closely follows the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , which found the answers to these questions for the lw @xmath1 to be _ yes _ and _ no _ , respectively ; we , on the other hand , show not only that the two lw @xmath1 states with generic @xmath27  tev masses are easily visible already with 10  fb@xmath2 of data , but also that the generic case produces a spectrum distinguishable from that generated by other common bsm scenarios .",
    "the only assumptions essential to this analysis are the @xmath28 signature of the states and the @xmath29 hierarchy of masses . the construction of ref .",
    "@xcite then shows that one can build a canonically normalized lagrangian of the form @xmath30 + \\mathcal{l}_{\\rm int } ( \\ { \\phi^{(i ) } \\ } ) \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 refers to the sm state , @xmath32 refers to the negative - norm lw state , @xmath33 refers to the heavy positive - norm lw state , and so on , up to arbitrary @xmath20 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , we outline the method of calculation for analyzing collider production of @xmath34 states , and discuss the expected signals of such states from not only lw , but kaluza - klein ( kk ) and other popular bsm scenarios as well .",

    "the factors @xmath44 represent cross terms between the allowed @xmath45 propagators ( see the appendix for a detailed description of the calculation of @xmath46 ) , and the @xmath14 ( symmetric ) and @xmath47 ( antisymmetric ) terms are the combinations of helicities @xmath48 and couplings @xmath49 of the leptons and quarks that carry the indicated parities with respect to the variable @xmath50 .",

    "the present work extends the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite by introducing an additional heavy state with positive norm , and hence with @xmath58 .",
    "one converts the differential cross section eq .",
    "( [ xsec ] ) into a distribution in the transverse mass @xmath59 , obtained from @xmath60 : @xmath61 the jacobian factor @xmath62 produces the peak structures seen in the plots in the next section .",
    "the new positive - norm state produces an observable signal in the region near @xmath63 , with a distinctive sharp interference edge generated by the off - diagonal terms in @xmath44 .    how do the predictions of the @xmath0 lwsm compare with those of other theories featuring a heavy @xmath64 boson ?",
    "the @xmath64 could , in principle , have arbitrary helicities and couplings to sm fields .",
    "the alternating - norm lw states offer just one such example amidst a plethora of possibilities .",
    "these include the sequential standard model ( the sm with extra gauge bosons carrying the same couplings ) , left - right symmetric models ( such as pati - salam ) , and kk excitations of the @xmath1 on a compactified @xmath65 dimension ( see  @xcite for a thorough list of references ) . it was shown in",
    "@xcite that the first two scenarios are already clearly distinguishable from the @xmath66 lwsm , so we do not consider them further .",
    "the hypothetical kk excitations of the @xmath1 , on the other hand , demand a more careful treatment .",
    "the most straightforward universal extra dimension models  @xcite already require @xmath67 to exceed several tev , but alternative mechanisms allow @xmath67 to be brought down to scales that can be probed at the lhc .",
    "suppose , for example , that gauge and higgs bosons propagate in the bulk of the @xmath68 dimension @xmath69 $ ] , but that leptons are localized at @xmath70 and quarks are localized at @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "such a mechanism can have a lower compactification scale ; as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for sake of argument we take it to be @xmath72  tev .",
    "the @xmath73 mode of the @xmath1 in the compactified dimension has a 5d wave function of the form @xmath74 .",
    "reading off the couplings from eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref .  @xcite , one sees that the localization of the quarks at @xmath75 forces their couplings in the 4d effective theory to be @xmath76 for the @xmath73 kk excitation of the @xmath1 . upon making this change to eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) , one finds that the kk excitations can mimic the wrong - sign propagator of the lw bosons quite faithfully .",
    "the only algebraic difference comes from the negative sign of @xmath77 , but due to the very narrow widths under consideration ( as calculated in the appendix ) , the two models are potentially virtually indistinguishable .",
    "this ambiguity could not be resolved within the framework of the @xmath66 lwsm , but we find that the @xmath0 lwsm yields starkly different predictions .    to illustrate this point , consider the mass term of the kk excitations , with @xmath78 being the bulk higgs field with vev @xmath79  @xcite and @xmath80 being the 5d gauge coupling : @xmath81 one sees that the squared masses of the kk excitations obey a specific @xmath82 hierarchy ; therefore , if the first excitation has a mass equal to that of the @xmath66  @xmath1 boson , the mass of the second kk excitation is pre - determined by the theory , whereas the masses of lw bosons can in principle assume any positive values .",
    "the spacing restriction is especially apparent in the limit @xmath83 , in which case the kk excitations have equally spaced masses @xmath84 in order for the kk and @xmath0 lwsm scenarios to be confused , either the experimental sensitivities must be such that only one excitation can be discerned in each case ( which reduces to the situation described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , or the spacing of the lw partners matches by unfortunate chance the spectrum given by eq .",
    "( [ kkmass ] ) . in this case",
    ", the natural next step would be to look for the kk and lw partners of other particles and examine their mass spectra for further evidence to distinguish the two possibilities .",
    "in general , however , we conclude that the generic @xmath0 lwsm makes unique predictions for mass and coupling spectra that can not be mimicked by well - known alternative @xmath64 theories .",

    "we start with the lhc inputs @xmath92  tev and 10  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity . assuming the masses @xmath93  gev , @xmath94  tev , @xmath95  tev , a set chosen purely for illustration",
    ", one then has all the necessary inputs to compute transverse mass distributions in the lwsm .",
    "we plot our results in fig .",
    "[ m2eq1m3eq2 ] .",
    "the most exciting feature is the statistically robust jacobian peak near @xmath63 at 10  fb@xmath2 , which is not only revealed as dozens of events that would not appear in the sm or even the @xmath66 lwsm , but one that exhibits a very distinctive morphology .",
    "this result indicates that , for a sufficiently light @xmath96 boson , the @xmath0 lwsm makes unambiguous predictions ( _ i.e. _ , are highly unlikely to be confused with kk modes or even the @xmath66 lw theory ) that can be tested at the lhc , given a reasonable 10  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "however , we hasten to add that nothing is special about the value @xmath86  tev ; in principle , the @xmath96 could be significantly heavier , still resolving the hierarchy problem ( although likely creating tension with ewpt  @xcite ) , but evading detection any time within the next decade .",
    "behavior that satisfies a theory well can provide a dull phenomenology : a sufficiently heavy @xmath96 combined with a lighter @xmath97 might still satisfy the ewpt constraints while slipping past the range of detection . even for @xmath98  tev",
    "this effect is quite stark ; see fig .",
    "[ m2eq1m3eq5 ] for a plot of the transverse mass distribution in such a theory .",
    "one can check that the absence of a strong @xmath98  tev signal is not due to the limited integrated luminosity , but rather the limited cm energy .",
    "one can also show that a 2012 lhc data set of 15  fb@xmath2 at @xmath91  tev allows the discovery bounds to be pushed even further . in fig .",
    "[ 15fb-1 ] we present the expectation in such a scenario for @xmath99  tev and @xmath90  tev , which provides further evidence that a wide expanse of lw parameter space will be probed in the near future at the lhc .",
    "the crucial point of the present work is that , regardless of the masses of the @xmath34 under consideration , the alternating - sign metric of the lwsm plus the lack of a specific mass spectrum functional dependence produces distinct jacobian peak structures that can be easily distinguished from those of other theories .",
    "our work in the @xmath0 lwsm shows that the presence of a heavy , positive - norm state has observable consequences for physics at the lhc .",
    "it makes predictions above and beyond that of the conventional @xmath66 lwsm , and moreover is clearly distinguishable from other heavy @xmath64 theories , most specifically the kaluza - klein excitations associated with particles propagating along a compactified @xmath68 dimension .",
    "the novel contribution of our work is the second jacobian peak associated with the @xmath0 @xmath1 boson .",
    "however , since little information exists to constrain the value of @xmath100  @xcite , our choice @xmath86  tev should be interpreted as one possibility of many .",
    "we find that , for a sufficiently heavy choice of @xmath100 ( @xmath101  tev ) , the expected signal for the @xmath0 theory does not rise significantly above the sm background for 10  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "finally , one might question the naturalness of the choice @xmath0 , and argue either that one has no good reason to stop at 3 , or that including as many as 2 lw partners is already excessive . for argument",
    "s sake , why would one settle with a theory of @xmath20 sets of states when @xmath102 sets might do an even better job of solving the hierarchy problem ?",
    "it is even possible ( albeit unpalatable ) for a countably infinite tower of lw states to exist , alternating in the signs of their norms , while still conspiring to cancel out divergences in loop diagrams ; the study of field equations of motion for infinite - order propagator poles was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , wherein the authors found that basic elements such as the propagator could still be reliably constructed in such a theory .",
    "these increasingly heavy states would serve an important theoretical role in the structure of the sm , but would lie far beyond the reach of any collider in the foreseeable future , not to mention creating a proliferation of new degrees of freedom .",
    "moreover , as discussed in the introduction , the @xmath22 lwsm with lighter partner masses is known to create significant tension with electroweak precision constraints ( particularly for custodial isospin violation ) , but we anticipate a large degree of cancellation at the @xmath23 level between the opposite - norm lw partners . for these reasons , we have restricted our attention solely to the @xmath0 lwsm ; the full range of phenomenologically allowed possibilities awaits an analysis of the precision constraints  @xcite .",
    "first address the question of diagonalizing gauge boson masses . in a lw theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking ,",
    "one generically encounters mass mixing terms between the sm and lw gauge bosons ; one must diagonalize this sector in order to construct gauge boson mass eigenstates .",
    "start with the higgs kinetic energy lagrangian @xmath103 where the metric @xmath104 encodes the opposite signs of the lw states , and the @xmath105 are given by @xmath106 note that only @xmath107 carries a nonzero vev .",
    "the hat on @xmath108 indicates an action on superfields containing both the sm field and its lw partners . for fields such as @xmath105 transforming under the fundamental representation of the group with gauge bosons denoted by @xmath109",
    ", one has @xmath110 . upon expanding the hd gauge superfield @xmath111 in terms of its lw components and resolving the resulting fields into mass eigenstates",
    ", one finds @xmath112 where the first equality is due to eq .",
    "( 3.9 ) of ref .",
    "the correlation of sm and lw fields  @xcite with @xmath113 is incorporated by defining the vector @xmath114 the mass eigenstates are denoted by a 0 subscript , and @xmath115 is a mixing matrix whose origin is explained shortly . expanding the superfield covariant derivative for the gauge fields using eq .",
    "( [ gaugesuper ] ) , one notes that in the absence of spontaneous symmetry breaking , the fields @xmath116 are the eigenstates with masses given by @xmath117 .",
    "however , the nonzero higgs vev connects all terms quadratic in the su(2 ) fields @xmath118 equally , mandating somewhat more effort to obtain the complete mass eigenstates . keeping only the terms quadratic in @xmath119",
    ", @xmath120 evaluated at its vev gives the additional mass contribution @xmath121 one sees that the higgs vev introduces a contribution to the gauge boson masses beyond the explicit masses @xmath122 , @xmath100 generated by the pure yang - mills lagrangian of the theory .",
    "since the diagonalization of the gauge sector entails solving the eigenvalue problem of a @xmath123 matrix , we introduce numerical matrices @xmath124 satisfying @xmath125 , where @xmath126 are the mass eigenstates associated with the eigenvalues in the propagator factors of eq .",
    ".      for the quarks , begin with definitions of the purely left - handed supermultiplets @xmath127 and @xmath128 , and define @xmath129 and @xmath130 analogously .",
    "( of course , @xmath15 and @xmath131 can refer to the collection of all up- and down - type quarks , respectively . ) here , the unprimed lw fields possess the same quantum numbers as their sm counterparts [ _ i.e. _ , all @xmath132 transform as @xmath133 under su(2)@xmath134u(1 ) ] , whereas the primed fields possess quantum numbers identical to the _ unprimed _ fields of _ opposite _ chirality , so that all @xmath135 ( like @xmath136 ) transform as @xmath137 and all @xmath138 ( like @xmath139 ) transform as @xmath133 .",
    "this relationship can be clarified by examining the derivation of the hdlw lagrangian from the original @xmath0 hd theory  @xcite , but arises quite generally for bsm theories in which fermions are permitted to possess explicit dirac mass terms .",
    "now examine the mass contribution to the lagrangian , which allows all sm and lw states to mix .",
    "these terms are of the form @xmath140 where the metric @xmath141 conveniently encodes the opposite signs of the positive- and negative - norm states . not counting the hermitian conjugates , eq .",
    "( [ supermass ] ) contains only @xmath142 mass terms of the forms ( @xmath143 ) @xmath144 for @xmath145 , which transform as @xmath146 and are manifestly invariant under su(2)@xmath134u(1 ) , and ( @xmath147 ) @xmath148 , which originate via yukawa couplings that are also invariant under su(2)@xmath134u(1 ) when the scalar fields are included , and which are made possible by the higgs vev .",
    "therefore , any linear combination of these mass terms via matrix diagonalization results in a gauge - invariant contribution to @xmath149 . in order to diagonalize the mass matrix , one must solve a system more involved than the standard eigenvalue problem in order to respect the metric @xmath150 of the lw lagrangian . to carry out the procedure , introduce symplectic transformations @xmath151 for each supermultiplet @xmath152 satisfying @xmath153 under these transformations",
    ", one identifies the linear combinations @xmath154 as the mass eigenstates corresponding to the diagonal mass matrix @xmath155 , thereby providing each field @xmath156 with an unmixed propagator .",

    "( [ quarkdiag ] ) in terms of a standard hermitian matrix diagonalization .",
    "the price of this diagonalization becomes apparent in the kinetic terms . using the supermultiplet notation ,",

    "<S> inspired by the lee - wick higher - derivative approach to quantum field theory , grinstein , oconnell , and wise have illustrated the utility of introducing into the standard model negative - norm states that cancel quadratic divergences in loop diagrams , thus posing a potential resolution of the hierarchy problem . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent work has shown that consistency with electroweak precision parameters requires many of the partner states to be too massive to be detected at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the phenomenology of a yet - higher derivative theory that exhibits three poles in its bare propagators ( hence @xmath0 ) , whose states alternate in norm . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the interference effects of @xmath1 boson partners on lhc scattering cross sections , and find that the @xmath0 lwsm already makes verifiable predictions at 10  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .    </S>",
