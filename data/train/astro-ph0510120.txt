    "ideally , one would like to use the proper probability distribution functions for the microlensing magnification probability as a function of , e.g. position in lens galaxy . in the following however , we assume a simple gaussian distribution and assume that extreme events with very large microlensing magnification factors can be identified from , e.g. pecularities of the lightcurves and be removed from the sample .",

    ", we follow the same recipe as ref .",
    "@xcite and obtain very similar results , see fig .",
    "[ fig : at1 ] . small differences are due to the random fluctuations in the simulation of lens systems as well as the fact that we only include the scatter in the slope @xmath67 in the uncertainty  not as a modification of the simulated sample as was the case in ref .",

    "the black line indicates the 95% confidence level for one of the parameters to lie within the contour ( i.e.  @xmath82 ) .",
    "because of the strong degeneracy in the time delay between @xmath4 and @xmath67 , flux ratio measurements are needed to constrain the hubble parameter . combining the results from the time delay and flux ratio measurements , we are able to make a determination of @xmath4 within 10% and  perhaps more interestingly  to determine @xmath67 at the per cent level at 95% confidence ( right panel ) . even for an extremely conservative value of @xmath83",
    ", we can determine @xmath67 within 2% and @xmath4 within 25% .",

    "this is equivalent to maximizing the quantity @xmath88 from a sample of @xmath89 lens systems , we are thus able to obtain @xmath90 time delay ratios with maximum sensitivity to @xmath68 .",

    "the `` false '' minima at very low @xmath68 is due to the fact that the ratio of distances often is degenerate in @xmath68 .",

    "the constraining power of the sample is limited by the low redshift ( @xmath104 ) of the cluster @xcite .",

    "note that the shape and size of the contours in the @xmath128$]-plane is very dependent on the exact configuration of the lens system .",
    "in general , results benefit from a large redshift separation for the sources since the time delay ratio is proportional to @xmath129 . however , even in the lucky case of finding a lensing system with two well - observed multiply imaged sources with time delays determined to good accuracy , we can only hope for very rough constraints on @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",

    "while cmb and lss data probe properties of dark matter on large scales , measurements of galactic halos can probe the small scale properties of dark matter .",
    "furthermore , gravitational lensing mainly probes halos at relatively high redshift where few methods for measuring galaxy density profiles are available .",

    "this bound is independent of the slope of the halos and the flux ratio measurements .",
    "second , we compared the results obtained for multiple systems with single sources with the use of lens systems with several multiply lensed sources in a single lens . for massive cluster size lenses , we expect to find several multiply imaged galaxy sources .",
    "the position of these images can provide a sanity check on @xmath68 .",
    "the error budget is dominated by the observational error in image position that need to be of the order or less than @xmath115 to be able to rule out an einstein - de sitter universe .",
    "systems with multiply imaged sources with measurable time delays will be rare and not very useful for the purposes discussed in this paper .    in the case of a large sample of individual multiple image systems , the error budget in the time delay analysis",
    "is dominated by the observational time delay error .",
    "the flux ratio constraints are quite robust to an increase in the ( gaussian ) error size . increasing the errors by a factor of 3 ( to 150% ) , we are still able to obtain @xmath130 ( @xmath82 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rq ] ) , it is evident that systems with large flux ratios ( i.e.  high @xmath58 ) are very important when constraining galaxy density profiles since the flux ratio in these systems are more sensitive to changes in @xmath67 .",
    "if such systems are absent from the sample , the error on @xmath67 will increase significantly .",
    "also , increasing the size of the external shear by a factor of ten causes a systematic bias in the determination of @xmath67 of @xmath131 .",
    "it should be noted that the use of flux ratio measurements is potentially very problematic because of large uncertainties in the microlensing magnification of individual images .",
    "since the errors are probably not gaussian , additional information on the probability distribution of the microlensing magnifications is most likely needed in order to be able to use the flux ratio information in an unbiased way . on the other hand , observations of the microlens",
    "magnification distribution is potentially a powerful probe of the small scale structure in galaxy halos .",
    "a possible complication is that our results for individual multiple image systems are based on the assumption that we can define average properties of lensing halos , i.e.  the value of @xmath67 , while n - body simulations indicate large dispersions in the individual halo properties @xcite .",
    "another caveat is that real lensing systems are too complicated to allow for an analysis as simplistic as in this paper .",
    "however , we are able to constrain @xmath67 and @xmath4 even with a quality factor @xmath64 as low as @xmath132 .",
    "is left more or less unconstrained for such low values of @xmath64 . ] if it is possible to retain a large number of lens systems , properties like redshift evolution of density profiles , variations in density profiles with galaxy luminosity , colour and many other important parameters can be measured by dividing the lens systems into different categories ( in which also the scatter in individual halo properties may be smaller ) .",
    "undoubtedly , modelling of real future lens systems will use more complicated lens models and observational information than the one used in this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our simple model is able to show the general parameter dependencies and approximate confidence contours that can be obtained with future strong lensing data .",
    "since our results are fairly robust to changes in the quantity and quality of the observational data , we conclude that strong lensing should be able to give useful constraints on the matter distribution in galaxies and galaxy clusters as well as complement other cosmological probes of the hubble parameter and the matter density .",

    "<S> we also investigate how strong lensing can provide useful constraints on the matter density of the universe independently of the flux ratios and other cosmological probes . </S>"
