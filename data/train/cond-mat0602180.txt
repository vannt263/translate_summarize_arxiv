    "since the pioneering work by anderson and fazekas  @xcite the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the triangular lattice has been considered one of the most promising candidates for a spin liquid phase in a frustrated antiferromagnet . however several numerical studies  @xcite have all consistently confirmed that in the isotropic triangular lattice the classical magnetically ordered state appears stable .",
    "nevertheless the ordered moment is found considerably smaller than the classical value ,  @xcite suggesting that the model is very close to a quantum critical point ,  @xcite namely to a phase where the long range antiferromagnetic order is completely destroyed .",
    "this picture is supported by the recently established result that in the quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice geometry  @xcite a spin liquid phase is stable , a result that is particularly important because for instance the same model on the square lattice displays only non spin liquid phases with broken translation symmetry .",
    "@xcite    recent experiments on two different materials  @xcite have renewed the interest in the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the triangular lattice described by the following hamiltonian :  @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a spin 1/2 located at site @xmath11 on the triangular lattice , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) indicates nearest neighbor sites along the chain ( between different chains ) , and the corresponding antiferromagnetic couplings are denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( see fig .",

    "clearly the anisotropy increases the quantum fluctuations in this model as for @xmath14 the hamiltonian @xmath15 reduces to a system of uncoupled one dimensional ( 1d ) chains , implying spin fractionalization and no antiferromagnetic order . in this limit",
    "the spin one excitations should form a broad two - spinon continuum of states as predicted theoretically ,  @xcite and indeed several experiments by inelastic neutron scattering have revealed this non trivial spin dynamics .",

    "_ ,  @xcite the low energy spin dynamics of @xmath0 have been studied systematically and found to be described essentially by the model hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) with anisotropic exchange interaction @xmath17 . in their experiments ,  @xcite there are two facts supporting the existence of a spin liquid phase in this system : i ) a spin spiral phase appears at temperatures below @xmath18 k , which is about the same order of magnitude as the inter - plane coupling @xmath19 in the third spatial direction , and therefore sizably smaller than the two dimensional ( 2d ) couplings @xmath5 ( @xmath20 mev ) and @xmath6 .",
    "in fact , true long range order in 2d is possible only at zero temperature and a finite @xmath21 is due to the inter plane coupling @xmath22 which allows to cut - off the logarithmically divergent quantum fluctuations in 2d .",
    "a finite @xmath21 is therefore expected to be of order @xmath23 , which appears slightly off from the observed @xmath24 k. ii ) at temperatures larger than @xmath21 ( or by applying an external magnetic field ) , the inelastic neutron scattering experiments  @xcite found that the line shape of the spectrum consists of a broad continuum , which is in contrast to the expected behavior of a magnetically ordered state , but is instead similar to the broad two - spinon continuum expected in the 1d systems mentioned above . therefore these experiments suggest that spin fractionalization can be realized also in this 2d system for temperatures higher than the corresponding 3d transition temperature @xmath21 .",

    "( [ defsr ] ) for the matrix @xmath125 in the sr scheme [ eq .",
    "( [ iterforce ] ) ] is particularly simple and convenient compared to the simplest steepest descent method . for a stable iterative method for the energy optimization , such as the sr method and the steepest descent one",
    ", a basic ingredient is that at each iteration the new set of parameters @xmath143 are determined close enough to the previous set @xmath144 in terms of a prescribed distance .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath148 the reason to normalize the two wave functions before computing their distance is obvious because , within a vmc scheme , the normalization of the wave function is irrelevant for quantum mechanical averages .",
    "the basic advantage of the sr method is the possibility to work directly with the wave function distance @xmath149 .",
    "in fact , this quantity can be explicitly written in terms of the matrix @xmath125 [ eq ,  ( [ defsr ] ) ] by substituting eq .",
    "( [ derwf ] ) in its definition eq .",
    "( [ defdistsr ] ) , yielding @xmath150 therefore the most convenient change of the variational parameters is to minimize the functional @xmath151 here @xmath152 is the linear change in the energy @xmath153 , and for @xmath154 the leading term of the expansion in small @xmath155 given in eq .",
    "( [ expdelta ] ) can be used .",
    "@xmath156 is a lagrange multiplier that allows for a stable minimization with small change @xmath154 of the wave function @xmath157 .",
    "then the stationary condition @xmath158 naturally lead to the sr iteration scheme described by eq .",
    "( [ iterforce ] ) with @xmath159 .    in a similar manner ,",
    "it is also possible to obtain the standard steepest descent method . in this case",
    "the cartesian metric defined in the @xmath139-dimensional space of the variational parameters is implicitly assumed to distinguish the two sets of variational parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ , the distance here is defined to be @xmath160 the same argument used above to minimize @xmath161 with respect to the variational parameter change @xmath162 will then lead to the standard steepest descent algorithm described by eq .",
    "( [ itersd ] ) .    the advantage of the sr method compared with the steepest descent one is now transparent .",
    "sometimes a small change of the variational parameters corresponds to a large change of the wave function , and conversely a large change of the variational parameters can imply only a small change of the wave function .",
    "the sr method takes into account this effect through a better definition of the distance @xmath163 [ eq .",
    "( [ defdistsr ] ) ] .    here",
    "a single sr iteration of the sr minimization scheme is summarized as follows : i ) a set of variational parameters @xmath164 is given after the @xmath36-th iteration , ii ) the generalized force @xmath116 [ eqs .",

    "[ plotmin ] , after the first few hundred iterations needed for equilibration , the variational parameters fluctuate around the stable mean values .",
    "it is interesting to notice in fig .",
    "[ plotmin ] that the variational parameters may continue to change substantially , even after the energy appears to reach its equilibrium value only after the first @xmath169 iterations .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath128 for @xmath170 .",
    "a stochastic minimization method like the steepest descent method or the sr one , which is based not only on the energy but also on its derivatives ( @xmath116 ) , is therefore much more efficient , especially for statistical methods where energy differences for slight changes of the variational parameters are often very noisy .",
    "having determined the optimized variational parameters @xmath171 as described above , a single standard vmc simulation is performed to calculate various physical quantities for @xmath172 using a bin length much larger than the one used in the sr minimization procedure .",
    "nevertheless , the mentioned euler conditions ( @xmath128 for all @xmath173 ) are usually satisfied within a few standard deviations simply because the statistically averaged variational parameters are much more accurate than the ones obtained at the final sr iteration .",
    "@xcite      as is well known , within the variational approach , it is sometimes very difficult to describe long range properties accurately .",
    "this is simply because these long range properties are rather insensitive to the energy , which is instead determined mainly by short range correlation functions .",
    "a clear example of this limitation is found when this method is applied , for instance , to study the long range antiferromagnetic order for the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the square lattice .",

    "<S> the strength of the spatial anisotropy can increase quantum fluctuations and can destabilize the magnetically ordered state leading to non conventional spin liquid phases . in order to understand these intriguing phenomena , quantum monte carlo methods </S>",
    "<S> are used to study this model system as a function of the anisotropic strength , represented by the ratio @xmath4 between the intra - chain nearest neighbor coupling @xmath5 and the inter - chain one @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found evidence of two spin liquid regions . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is stable for small values of the coupling @xmath7 , and appears gapless and fractionalized , whereas the second one is a more conventional spin liquid with a small spin gap and is energetically favored in the region @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that in both spin liquid phases there is no evidence of broken translation symmetry with dimer or spin - peirls order or any broken spatial reflection symmetry of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the various phases are in good agreement with the experimental findings , thus supporting the existence of spin liquid phases in two dimensional quantum spin-1/2 systems . </S>"
