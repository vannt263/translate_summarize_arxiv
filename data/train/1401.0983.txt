    "the kubo - transformed quantum correlation function @xmath0 is an important quantity to characterize quantum dynamical effects of operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 and plays a central role in the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "however , it is not easy to calculate @xmath0 , because most of the numerical techniques for quantum many - body systems @xcite are based on the imaginary time path integral formalism @xcite and we can not directly apply them to the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "recently , a new quantum dynamics method to calculate @xmath0 has been proposed by krishna and voth @xcite .",
    "this is an extended quantum dynamics perturbed by external sources @xcite and is applicable to the case that the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 depend on the position operator @xmath3 only .",
    "the calculation procedure is summarized as follows : ( 1 ) introduce two external sources @xmath4 and @xmath5 that couple to the operators @xmath1 and @xmath6 , respectively ; here , @xmath6 is the operator that satisfies @xmath7 .",
    "( 2 ) calculate the expectation value of the momentum operator @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where the equilibrium density operator @xmath10 is given by the hamiltonian @xmath11 and the time evolution of @xmath8 is driven by the hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "( 3 ) differentiate @xmath13 with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 ; we obtain the kubo - transformed quantum correlation function using the krishna - voth formula @xmath15 .",
    "their method is quite promising , because @xmath13 is a nonequilibrium expectation value that can be calculated by means of various quantum dynamics methods @xcite .",
    "they have applied this new method to a quantum anharmonic oscillator and shown that it works well for the calculation of nonlinear correlation functions @xcite .",
    "it is still unclear , however , whether their method can be applied to general quantum systems , because basic properties of the krishna - voth formula have not been clarified .    in this work ,",
    "we refine the formulation of krishna and voth s external source method , and derive a new exact formula for kubo - transformed quantum correlation functions .",
    "we clarify the approximation implicitly used by krishna and voth and show that the approximation is valid in the short time limit . as an example , we show the calculations of the position autocorrelation function for a harmonic oscillator and discuss some properties of this method .",
    "in this section , we present a refined formulation of krishna and voth s external source method @xcite . for simplicity , we consider a one - dimensional quantum system described by hamiltonian @xmath16 the equilibrium density operator of this system is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the inverse temperature and @xmath19 is the quantum partition function .",
    "the thermal expectation value of an operator @xmath1 is defined by @xmath20 .",
    "we consider a kubo - transformed quantum correlation function for position dependent operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kubo - transformed operator , @xmath25      first , we introduce a constant external source @xmath4 which couples to the operator @xmath1 .",
    "the perturbed hamiltonian is defined by @xmath26 assuming small @xmath4 , we expand the boltzmann operator for @xmath27 , @xmath28 this leads to following identities : @xmath29 here , @xmath30 is the quantum partition function and @xmath31 is the equilibrium density operator of the perturbed system . +",
    "next , we consider a position dependent operator @xmath32 that satisfies @xmath33 and introduce another external source @xmath5 that couples to the operator @xmath6 .",
    "another perturbed hamiltonian is defined by @xmath34 then , we consider a time - dependent momentum operator @xmath35 , the time evolution of which is given by @xmath36 , @xmath37 using perturbative expansions of the time evolution operators with respect to @xmath5 , @xmath38 and using an identity @xmath39=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial q}f(\\hat{q } ) , \\label{13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] is the commutator @xmath41=\\hat{a}\\hat{b}-\\hat{b}\\hat{a}$ ] , we obtain the following identity @xmath42 here , @xmath43 is an operator , @xmath44 , \\label{15a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is omitted in the krishna - voth formalism @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath43 vanishes at @xmath45 , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "let us rewrite the kubo - transformed quantum correlation function @xmath0 ( eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) ) by means of two external sources ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) and corresponding perturbed hamiltonians ( @xmath27 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "consider a time - dependent expectation value of the momentum operator @xmath8 , @xmath47 this is a nonequilibrium expectation value of @xmath8 , because the initial distribution is given by one hamiltonian whereas the time evolution is driven by another .",
    "the derivative of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 at @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be written using eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) as @xmath50 using eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) , we obtain a new exact formula for kubo - transformed quantum correlation functions , @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "this formula allows us to calculate @xmath0 by pursuing the dynamics of the momentum expectation value @xmath13 and the operator @xmath43 . + it should be noted here that there is a restriction on the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the operators we can treat in this external source method are limited depending on the hamiltonian of the original system .",
    "this is because the spectra of the perturbed hamiltonians @xmath27 and @xmath36 should be bounded from below for the stability of the perturbed systems .      although eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) is exact , this formula is not suited for practical uses , because the calculations of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are in general more demanding than the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason , it might be useful to give an approximate expression of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) . as a simple approximation",
    ", we neglect the contribution of the operator @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) @xmath56 and obtain a simple formula @xmath57 this is identical to the formula given by krishna and voth @xcite .",
    "therefore , we refer to the approximation ( eq .",
    "( [ 19a ] ) ) as the krishna - voth approximation and refer to @xmath58 ( eq . ( [ 19 ] ) ) as the krishna - voth correlation function .",
    "because of @xmath46 for any system , the krishna - voth approximation is exact in the short time limit .",
    "let us apply the external source method ( eqs .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) ) ) to the calculations of kubo - transformed autocorrelation functions @xmath59 for a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator , the potential of which is given by @xmath60 in the harmonic system , if the operator @xmath1 is nonlinear in position , @xmath61 , either @xmath27 or @xmath36 always gives energy spectra unbounded from below .",
    "therefore , we treat the linear operator , @xmath62 , to illustrate the method . the exact expression of @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64 in this case , the perturbations are introduced as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where the external source @xmath5 is assumed to be @xmath67 for the stability of the perturbed system . the time dependent momentum operator ( eq . ( [ 11 ] ) ) and its nonequilibrium expectation value ( eq .",
    "( [ 16 ] ) ) can be calculated analytically , @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the modified frequency .",
    "the derivative of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 is evaluated at @xmath48 and @xmath49 as @xmath70 on the other hand , the operator @xmath43 is given by @xmath71 and another kubo - transformed quantum correlation function @xmath53 is obtained as @xmath72 we also obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "although eqs .",
    "( [ 24 ] ) and ( [ 26 ] ) contain unfavorable terms that diverge in the long time limit , these terms are cancelled out in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) to reproduce the exact result ( eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) ) .",
    "finally , we obtain the krishna - voth correlation function ( eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) ) , @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the plot of the exact kubo - transformed quantum correlation function ( eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) ) and the krishna - voth correlation function ( eq . ( [ 28 ] ) ) with the parameters @xmath77 .",
    "the krishna - voth correlation function coincides with the exact correlation function at @xmath45 .",
    "this is because the krishna - voth approximation ( eq . ( [ 19a ] ) ) is exact in the short time limit .",
    "however , as the time @xmath14 increases , the krishna - voth correlation function deviates from the exact one and its amplitude grows with time . in the long time",
    "limit @xmath78 , the phase shift @xmath79 converges to @xmath80 , whereas the amplitude enhancement factor @xmath81 diverges .",
    "such unbounded growth of amplitude is often observed in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the second term of eq . ( [ 27 ] ) , which is proportional to @xmath82 , corresponds to the secular term in perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the calculation of the position autocorrelation function for the harmonic oscillator , the krishna - voth approximation ( eq . ( [ 19a ] ) )",
    "works only in the short time region . the discrepancy between @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "can be improved by neither increasing nor decreasing the temperature @xmath85 .",
    "this is because in this case , the ratio of @xmath84 to @xmath83 , @xmath86 is independent of the temperature .",
    "therefore , at any temperature , we obtain the result similar in shape as figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "+ here , we give a brief discussion on the origin of the secular behavior of @xmath58 ( eq . ( [ 19 ] ) ) .",
    "let us start with an eigenstate representation of @xmath13 , @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the eigenstates and eigenvalues of the perturbed hamiltonian @xmath36 ( eq . ( [ 10 ] ) ) .",
    "the derivative of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 contains terms proportional to @xmath90 .",
    "how these terms contribute to @xmath58 depends on the character of the system and the functional forms of operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "as we have shown in this section , for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator , the secular term becomes dominant in @xmath84 as the time @xmath14 increases . on the other hand , krishna and voth",
    "have applied the method to a one - dimensional anharmonic oscillator @xmath91 and computed nonlinear correlation functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "their numerical results show no sign of diverging behavior and agree reasonably well with the exact results in a wide time range .",
    "their work suggests that the contribution of the terms proportional to @xmath90 could be suppressed by non - linearity of the potential and/or the operators .",
    "in this work , we have reformulated the external source method proposed by krishna and voth @xcite and derived an exact formula for kubo - transformed quantum correlation functions ( eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) ) .",
    "an approximation ( eq . ( [ 19a ] ) ) , which is exact at @xmath45 , have been proposed and identified as the approximation implicitly used by krishna and voth @xcite .",
    "we have carried out analytical calculations of the position autocorrelation functions for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) ) and found that the krishna - voth correlation function ( eq .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) ) has a term that behaves as the secular term in perturbation theory .",
    "+ it will be important in future work to clarify the condition that the krishna - voth approximation ( eq .",
    "( [ 19a ] ) ) remains valid beyond the short time region .",
    "more detailed analyses based on the eigenstate representation ( eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) ) will be needed .",
    "the test calculations performed by krishna and voth @xcite suggest that the secular behavior of @xmath58 could be suppressed by nonlinearity of the potential @xmath94 and/or nonlinearity of the operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to these nonlinear effects , symmetry and multi - dimensionality of the system might be significant .",
    "this is because , in general , symmetry of the system could give some constraints on the behavior of correlation functions , and many - body effects could cause dephasing , that is , suppression of the oscillating behavior of correlation functions .",
    "it will also be interesting to examine the possibility to get rid of the secular terms by means of some prescriptions like the renormalization group method for ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "+ in the external source method , the types of operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 are limited by a stability condition : the spectra of the perturbed hamiltonians @xmath27 and @xmath36 should be bounded from below to ensure the stability of the perturbed systems . however , in practice , the condition could be relaxed , because the method is formulated by means of the perturbative expansion with respect to infinitesimal external sources @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and , therefore , the equilibrium distribution and the time evolution of the unstable perturbed systems could be effectively stable .",
    "in analytical calculations , we could make a rigorous discussion on the effective stability of unstable perturbed systems , because we can take the limit @xmath95 analytically . on the other hand , in numerical calculations ,",
    "more careful handling of the effectively stable systems would be required , because in numerical treatments , the external sources @xmath4 and @xmath5 are chosen to be small but finite to evaluate the derivatives of @xmath96 by the finite difference approximation , for example , @xmath97 @xcite . therefore , some practical prescriptions to handle such perturbed systems should be established . + it is also important to develop efficient algorithms to calculate the time - dependent momentum expectation value @xmath13 ( eq . (",
    "[ 16 ] ) ) . by means of the nonequilibrium path",
    "integral centroid dynamics @xcite , @xmath13 for the position autocorrelation functions for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator ( eq .",
    "( [ 23 ] ) ) can be calculated exactly @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical implementation of the nonequilibrium path integral centroid dynamics could be much more demanding than the usual path integral molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "other nonequilibrium quantum dynamics methods @xcite would be better suited for further applications of the external source method to more realistic systems .    99 kubo , r. ; toda , n. ; hashitsume , n. , _ statistical physics ii : nonequilibrium statistical mechanics _ , 2nd ed . , springer - verlag : heidelberg , * 1991*. berne , b. j. ; thirumalai , d. , annu .",
