    "recently @xcite the glauber approach to final state interaction ( fsi ) in the inclusive quasi - elastic @xmath3 process , has been extended by taking into account the virtuality of the hit nucleon after @xmath4 absorption .",
    "it has been found that at large @xmath2 , due to the fact that the hit nucleon need a finite formation time ( fft ) to reach its asymptotic form , the interaction with the remainder of the target nucleus becomes very weak and vanishes in the asymptotic limit . in this contribution , we present the results of a calculation based upon the extension of the method of @xcite to the exclusive , @xmath0he(e , ep)@xmath1h , and semi - inclusive , @xmath0he ( e , ep)x , processes .",
    "under certain approximations whose validity will not be discussed here ( see e.g. @xcite , the cross section for the process @xmath3 , can be shown to have the following form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a kinematical factor and @xmath7 the nucleon distorted momentum distributions , which in the case of the semi - inclusive process @xmath0he(e , ep)x ,",

    "@xmath7 is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18    with @xmath19 denoting the @xmath1h wave function .",
    "in our calculations both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 wave functions , which correspond to the reid soft core v@xmath22 interaction , have been taken from @xcite .",
    "the glauber operator @xmath15 is explicitly given by @xcite @xmath23 where the knocked out nucleon is denoted by `` 4 '' . here the @xmath24-axis is oriented along the direction of the motion of the knocked out proton , @xmath25 is the component of the nucleon coordinate in the @xmath26 plane , and @xmath27 stands for the usual glauber profile function @xmath28 with @xmath29 denoting the total proton - nucleon cross section , and @xmath30 the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the forward elastic @xmath31 scattering amplitude .",
    "the value of @xmath29 and @xmath30 were chosen at the proper values of the invariant mass of the process , and the numerical values were taken from ref .",

    "1 , the following remarks are in order . the pwia predicts a minimum at @xmath47 , which is completely filled up by the glauber - type fsi .",
    "the latter exhibits a very small @xmath2 dependence , unlike fft effects which depend on @xmath2 in such a way that at @xmath48 they completely kill the fsi , so that the minimum is fully recovered .",
    "the fft effects on the semi - inclusive reaction @xmath0he(e , ep)x at parallel kinematics are shown in fig .",

    "the results of the calculations that we have exhibited , show that the exclusive process @xmath0he(e , ep)@xmath1h at high values of @xmath2 could provide a clear cut check of various models which go beyond the treatment of fsi effects in terms of glauber - type rescattering .",
    "in particular , the fft approach of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts a clean and regular @xmath2 behaviour leading to the vanishing of fsi effects at moderately large values of @xmath2 ; such a prediction would be validated by the experimental observation of a dip in the cross section at @xmath51 .",

    "the @xmath0he(e , ep)@xmath1h reaction , using a colour transparency model . at variance with our results ,",
    "their model does not lead to the vanishing of fsi at @xmath52 .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that exclusive electron scattering off @xmath20 would really represent a powerful tool to discriminate various models of hadronic final state rescattering .    5 m.a .",
