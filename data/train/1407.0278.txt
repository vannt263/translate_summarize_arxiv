    "computer simulations of physical and mechanical behaviors provide powerful tools for overcoming the difficulties that material properties can not be designed . generally , according to the scales ,",
    "two well - established classes of models are widely used , i.e. molecular models and continuum models .",
    "the study of the relationships between structures and properties in various levels produces rigorous theoretical supports and effective computational techniques in new material developments ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    the molecular models , such as coarse grained molecular dynamics ( cgmd ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and tight binding molecular dynamics ( tbmd ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , provide detailed information about the micro - nano mechanism .",
    "but most of those rely heavily on the empirical potential functions between particles and grains .",
    "thus it is still an open problem of formulating the multi - element systems ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . meanwhile , the density functional theory ( dft ) is coded and applied to complex systems , and present papers confirm the physical and chemical quantities obtained by first principle calculations ( ref .",
    "however , for the cases when numerous electrons contained and particular symmetry lacked , such as anisotropic films and polymer materials ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the local approximation fails in the descriptions of exchange and correlation effects .",
    "note that even micro - nano devices are composed by more than @xmath0 atoms and electrons , thus high efficient computable models are urgent to be developed for micro - nano simulations .",
    "the continuum models describe the physical responses of large scale systems and long running processes .",
    "but the sufficient accuracy initial parameters and boundary conditions are needed to make the results credible .",
    "so there emerged many multi - scale algorithms and models to solve the governing equations , such as the quasicontinuum method ( qc ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the bridging scale method ( bsm ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the heterogeneous multi - scale method ( hmm ) ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , etc .",
    "most of those models need special transition regions that link the atom and the continuum regions , while few of them link directly .",
    "unfortunately , the boundary conditions under different scales are generally incompatible , thus occurs the `` ghost force '' ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , the transition regions are not easy to determine in real - time simulations .    for approaching the real physical processes in the macro - meso - micro coupled simulations ,",
    "a quantum - atomic - continuum - coupled method ( qacc ) with the local quantum effects considered is modeled . in qacc model , the atom and the continuum regions are linked without the transition regions .",
    "a linear expansion method is employed and the high - order terms are truncated when solving the electronic structure kohn - sham equation . unlike traditional finite element triangulations ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we use primitive cells of the complex bravais lattice to construct basic deformation elements and deduce the mechanical tensors , as most of the polycrystalline systems and the micro - nano devices have particular topological structures . furthermore , the physical properties of micro - nano materials are extremely sensitive to the variation of intrinsic structures ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and the material damages occur exactly in the defect areas where the micro - structures deconstruct",
    ". thus our model may give better results of plastic variations and constitutive parameters .",
    "the remainder of this paper is outlined as follows : in section ii , a quantum energy density distribution of large atomic system is described .",
    "section iii introduces basic deformation elements of the complex bravais lattice firstly , and then the explicit expressions of strain , stress and other mechanical tensors are derived .",
    "section iv shows the numerical simulations of copper nanowires composed of 25313 atoms under tension and bending .",
    "strain and stress fields are calculated to confirm our model .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section v.",
    "as mentioned previously , it takes enormous amount of efforts solving the atomic system completely by first principle calculations . for the computations of multi - scale and multi - model coupled quantities , some necessary assumptions and techniques",
    "are adopted in this section .",
    "keeping certain precision , qacc model can simulate damage processes and behaviors of materials at the micro - nano scale by the ab initio quantum mechanics .",
    "consider a local atomic system which composed with @xmath1 nuclei and @xmath2 electrons . here",
    "the uppercase letters are used for quantities of nuclei and the lowercase letters for electrons .",
    "the hartree atomic units are adopted so that the four fundamental physical constants are unity , i.e. @xmath3 . according to density functional theory , the non - relativistic kohn - sham equation can be written as @xmath4 note that @xmath5 is the exchange - correlation energy , @xmath6 is the electron density , @xmath7 contains both the external field potential @xmath8 and the coulomb interaction @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the atomic number ( ref .",
    "thus the ground state total energy is @xmath11    now we consider @xmath12 as contributions of each atom centered at @xmath13 , a traditional consideration is the average distribution , and each atom occupies @xmath14 of the total energy .",
    "but when a micro - damage occurs in materials , stress concentrates , crack propagates , and finally energy dissipates in the defect area .",
    "thus the simple average method is not able to reflect the energy variation between atoms in and around the defect area ( ref .",

    "in order to simulate the process from defects to damages of micro - nano devices , and to formulate the constitutive law of materials at the micro - nano scale , the total displacement field of each atom is decomposed into a low oscillatory deformation part and a high frequent vibration part @xmath45 , as the boundary conditions at the atom scale and the continuum scale differ by orders of magnitudes . here",
    "the deformation part is obtained by the average position of 2 picoseconds of each atom in each loading step .",
