    "the observation that the low energy limit of certain open string theories can be interpreted as yang - mills theories living on a noncommutative  ( nc ) manifold  @xcite has raised renewed interest in noncommutative quantum field theories . furthermore , noncommutative quantum field theory  ( ncqft ) in itself remains an appealing way to introduce a length scale and to cut off some short - distance contributions  @xcite consistently with the symmetries of a given model .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the nc structure of spacetime is described by a set of _ constant c - number _ parameters  @xmath3 , or , equivalently , by an energy scale @xmath4 and dimensionless parameters  @xmath5 : @xmath6      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu }      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{nc}}^2 } c^{\\mu\\nu }      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{nc}}^2 }               \\begin{pmatrix }                  0 & - e^1 & - e^2 & - e^3 \\\\",

    "obviously , fixed non - vanishing values for  @xmath3 result in a breaking of lorentz invariance .",
    "a possible mechanism of spontaneous breaking is the condensation of a rank two antisymmetric background field . in this paper",
    ", we will investigate phenomenological consequences of  @xmath3 at hadron colliders and not deal with the dynamics of the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "since the string scale is essentially unknown , we have also no prediction for @xmath4 .",
    "the current best collider tests  @xcite give @xmath9{gev}$ ] for a nc extension of qed , while experiments at a future photon collider are expected to reach  @xcite .",
    "tests of rotation invariance in atomic physics and astrophysical tests give substantially higher bounds , but assume nc geometry at large scales ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "collider experiments do not probe space - time coordinates themselves , but functions of space - time coordinates , such as wave functions of external particles and effective lagrangians .",
    "consequently , one can employ a deformed product to describe the scattering theory on a given nc manifold by an equivalent scattering theory on a commuting manifold with new effective interactions . in the case of the operator algebra  ( [ eq : theta ] ) , one can use the moyal - weyl @xmath10-product  @xcite @xmath11 to map products of functions of nc coordinates , @xmath12 , to the equivalent products of functions on ordinary space - time coordinates , @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to see that the commutation relation  ( [ eq : theta ] ) is reproduced by the @xmath10-commutator : @xmath14(x )     =    ( x^\\mu \\ast x^\\nu)(x )     - ( x^\\nu \\ast x^\\mu)(x )     = { \\mathrm{i}}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}=[\\hat{x}^\\mu,\\hat{x}^\\nu]\\,.\\ ] ] the obvious approach to constructing ncqfts by replacing all field products by the @xmath10-product  ( [ eq : moyal - weyl ] ) fails for general gauge theories .",
    "for example , in such a nc version of qed all charged matter field must carry the same charge  @xcite which makes this approach unsuitable for the @xmath15 hypercharge of the standard model .",
    "furthermore , this approach does not work for @xmath16 gauge theories , because the @xmath10-commutator of two infinitesimal gauge transformations does not close in the @xmath16 lie algebra  @xcite : @xmath17 =    [ \\alpha^at^a \\operatorname{\\stackrel{\\ast}{,}}\\beta^bt^b ] =    \\frac{1}{2}\\{\\alpha^a\\operatorname{\\stackrel{\\ast}{,}}\\beta^b\\}[t^a , t^b ]     + \\frac{1}{2}[\\alpha^a\\operatorname{\\stackrel{\\ast}{,}}\\beta^b]\\{t^a , t^b\\ } \\,.\\ ] ] in order to circumvent these problems , we follow the approach of  @xcite and let the nc gauge field  @xmath18 and gauge parameter  @xmath19 take their values in the enveloping algebra of the lie algebra of the standard model  ( sm ) gauge group @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 and the nc matter fields  @xmath21 are expressed as nonlinear functions of ordinary fields @xmath22 , @xmath23 and  @xmath24 via seiberg - witten maps ( swm )  @xcite such that the nc gauge transformations of the former ,    [ eq : nc - gauge - transformations ] @xmath25            + \\frac{({\\mathrm{i}}g)^2}{2 ! } [ \\hat\\lambda\\operatorname{\\stackrel{\\ast}{,}}[\\hat\\lambda\\operatorname{\\stackrel{\\ast}{,}}\\hat a_\\mu ] ]            + \\partial_\\mu \\hat\\lambda            + { \\mathrm{i}}g [ \\hat\\lambda\\operatorname{\\stackrel{\\ast}{,}}\\partial_\\mu \\hat\\lambda ]            + \\mathcal{o}(\\hat\\lambda^3)\\ , , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    are realized by ordinary gauge transformations of the latter :    [ eq : gauge - transformations ] @xmath26            + \\frac{({\\mathrm{i}}g)^2}{2 ! } [ \\lambda , [ \\lambda , a_\\mu ] ]            + \\partial_\\mu \\lambda            + { \\mathrm{i}}g",

    "the swm approach also solves the charge quantization problem by introducing a separate nc gauge field for each eigenvalue of the @xmath15 charge operator .",
    "each of these gauge fields is subsequently mapped by the swm to the _ same _ sm @xmath15 field .",
    "thus no additional degrees of freedom appear .",
    "this approach has been used to construct a nc generalization of the complete electroweak standard model  @xcite , which will be referred to as ncsm below .",
    "this construction leads to modifications of the familiar sm interaction vertices as well as to new interactions that are forbidden in the sm .",
    "the most striking feature of the ncsm is that it allows direct interactions among neutral gauge bosons , depending on the representation of the enveloping algebra chosen for the trace in the gauge boson lagrangian  @xcite @xmath30 note that all representations are equivalent up to a renormalization only in the case of lie algebras , but not in the corresponding enveloping associative algebra .",
    "we should point out that nc gauge theories constructed from commutative gauge theories using the swm are not renormalizable by field and gauge coupling renormalization alone , since the @xmath31-point functions of matter fields require additional counterterms that can not be obtained from the application of the swm  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the ncsm can be employed as a well defined effective field theory , because any chiral model that is constructed from an anomaly free chiral model using the swm has been shown to be anomaly free  @xcite .",
    "to first order in  @xmath3 , all modifications of the sm correspond to effective dimension - six operators . the latter lead to observable deviations from the sm predictions or , in the absence of deviations , to bounds on @xmath4 .",
    "initially , most phenomenological studies have focused on rare and @xmath32-decays  @xcite , while tests at future colliders have been considered in  @xcite .",

    "we shall point out experimental signatures unique to the ncsm and estimate the range of the nc scale  @xmath4 that can be probed at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : xsect ] , we discuss the scattering amplitude that gives rise to the signals described in section  [ sec : signals ] . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we analyse the results of our monte carlo  ( mc ) simulations and estimate the discovery reach . section  [ sec : concl ] gives a short outlook on future work .",
    "feynman rules and analytical results for the cross section are presented in the appendix .",
    "the pair production of neutral electroweak gauge bosons @xmath34 at a hadron collider is described by the partonic process @xmath35 .",
    "the corresponding squared matrix element at @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the sm amplitude with @xmath39 and @xmath40 denotes the new contributions arising in the ncsm .",
    "the relevant feynman rules are provided in appendix  [ app : feynman ] .",
    "below , the @xmath36 contributions to the sm vertices  ( [ eq : vertex - ffv ] ) have been marked by an open box in the corresponding sm feynman diagrams :    [ eq : nc - amplitude ] @xmath41 the contact term @xmath42 with the vertex given in  ( [ eq : vertex - ffvv ] ) , is required by gauge invariance , as can be seen from the ward identity  ( [ eq : wia ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the two @xmath43-channel diagrams @xmath44    involving the triple gauge boson couplings given in  ( [ eq : vertex - vvv ] ) are separately gauge invariant .",
    "the corresponding ward identities    @xmath45    have been proven in  @xcite .",
    "the separate gauge invariance of  @xmath46 and  @xmath47 is not surprising , because the strength of the triple gauge boson interactions depends on the choice of representation of the enveloping algebra  @xcite used for the gauge field lagrangian  ( [ eq : tr(f^2 ) ] ) .",
    "the new coupling constants  @xmath48 and  @xmath49 are only constrained by the matching to the sm in the limit @xmath50 and can vary independently in a finite range  @xcite , as illustrated in fig .",

    "it has been shown  @xcite for @xmath51-collisions that polarization is essential for obtaining a non - vanishing signal in @xmath36 . at the lhc",
    "one will not have polarized initial states , neither can one expect to observe the polarization of outgoing photons or use @xmath52-decays as a polarimeter .",
    "therefore , we have concentrated on unpolarized @xmath2-production . the analytical result for @xmath53",
    "is presented in appendix  [ app : xsect ] .    without polarization ,",
    "the most important observable , i.e.  an azimuthal dependence of the cross section , vanishes for symmetric initial and final states , as we will see in section  [ sec : signals ] . in the present case ,",
    "it is the axial coupling of the  @xmath52 that will engender an observable deviation from the sm prediction .",
    "since the width of the intermediate @xmath52 is negligible for @xmath54 , one needs another source for an imaginary part in the scattering amplitudes to compensate the factor of @xmath55 that comes with @xmath3 and to obtain a non - vanishing contribution to the @xmath36 interference . in polarized scattering",
    ", the polarization vectors and spinors can provide this imaginary part , but all the polarization sums are real , of course .",
    "however , the @xmath56 factor in the axial coupling of the @xmath52 produces a factor @xmath57 after tracing and thus creates a non - vanishing effect from contractions with the three independent momenta and  @xmath3 .",
    "the relevant hadronic processes are @xmath59 at the lhc and @xmath60 at the tevatron with subsequent decays of the @xmath52 into @xmath61 and @xmath62 . for these",
    ", the cross sections and lepton distributions have been calculated using the results for the hard @xmath63 cross sections from section  [ sec : xsect ] together with the phase space generation and parton distribution functions provided by whizard  @xcite for monte carlo simulation .",
    "as expected for new short distance physics , we observe a deviation of the photon @xmath64 distribution at high @xmath64 from the sm prediction .",
    "however , this deviation is not specific to the ncsm and , in addition , turns out to be smaller than a few  @xmath65 for  @xmath66 . on the other hand , the nc parameter @xmath3 breaks rotational invariance and leads to a characteristic dependence of the cross sections on the azimuthal angle  @xmath67 , which can be used to discriminate against other new physics effects .",
    "for this reason , we have focussed our phenomenological analysis on the azimuthal distribution of the photon .",
    "as has been shown previously  @xcite , the @xmath68 amplitude in the ncsm depends only on @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath71 amplitude also depends on  @xmath72 and  @xmath73 , due to the axial @xmath74 couplings .",
    "in addition , a dependence on  @xmath75 appears because the vector bosons are not aligned with the beam axis  @xmath76 .",
    "nevertheless , the cms parton cross sections show a much stronger dependence on the components @xmath7 than on @xmath8 , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuthal / e / b ] . to be precise , this is true everywhere except sufficiently close to the polar angle @xmath77 , where the dependence on @xmath7 vanishes due to the antisymmetry of the @xmath36 contribution to @xmath78 in @xmath79 .",
    "azimuthal distribution of the @xmath80 in @xmath81 at fixed cms energy @xmath82 for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , in comparison with @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "]    however , at hadron colliders , the partonic cms of most events is boosted significantly along the beam axis . as is well known from electrodynamics , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mixed by lorentz boosts along the beam axis @xmath76 : @xmath87 ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively , are therefore highly correlated by kinematics .",
    "we have verified that the strenght of the correlation is essentially determined by the expectation value of the boost @xmath92 .",
    "[ sec : unphysical ]    calculating the scattering amplitude only to first order in the noncommutativity  @xmath3 , one must neglect the @xmath93 contributions in the squared amplitude for consistency .",
    "therefore , in this approximation , the deviations from the sm only come from the interference of  @xmath94 with  @xmath95 in  ( [ eq:|a|^2 ] ) . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath36 cross section can even become negative in some regions of phase space for sufficiently large absolute values and appropriate signs of components of  @xmath3 , such that the nc / sm interference dominates over the sm contribution .",
    "the relative size of the interference term is determined by @xmath96 , @xmath82 being the partonic cms energy .",
    "there is a wide range of possible values of @xmath82 in high energy hadron collisions , but the most statistics will be collected at moderate values of  @xmath82 .",
    "thus in @xmath36 , values of  @xmath4 that cause observable deviations at such moderate values of  @xmath82 can lead to unphysical cross sections at the highest  @xmath82 available .",
    "this problem is not specific to simulations in the ncsm , but common to all studies of new physics that can be parametrized by anomalous couplings .",
    "a pragmatic solution is to unitarize the contributions from new physics by applying appropriate form factors that cut off the unphysical effects .",
    "since there are very few events to be expected at the highest cms energies , the conclusions should not depend on the details of the form factors .",
    "therefore , we have simply replaced @xmath78 by @xmath97 everywhere in our simulations .    this solution is also legitimized by the expectation that higher orders in  @xmath3 will damp the large negative interference contributions .",
    "in fact , preliminary results to second order in @xmath3 support this expectation  @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain a realistic estimate of the sensitivity at the tevatron and the lhc , one has to take into account backgrounds , detector effects and selection cuts .",
    "clearly , a comprehensive analysis of all reducible backgrounds and detector effects is beyond the scope of a theoretical study and must eventually be performed by the experimental collaborations .",
    "however , the final states under consideration are simple enough for a phenomenological analysis based on simple cuts .",
    "moreover , experience at the tevatron  @xcite indicates that the combined detection efficiency for @xmath98 can be assumed to be larger than @xmath99 .",
    "all numerical results presented below are obtained for a @xmath100 efficiency .",
    "smaller uniform efficiencies can easily be taken into account by scaling up the integrated luminosity accordingly .",
    "we have simulated the process @xmath101 at @xmath102{tev}$ ] using the program package whizard  @xcite and demanding the following acceptance cuts on leptons and photons :    [ eq : acceptance ] @xmath103{gev } \\\\",

    "this assumption is not justified , because we should expect that @xmath3 is aligned with a fixed cosmic reference frame , that is determined by the dynamics of the underlying string theory .",
    "therefore the alignment of the detector must be recorded with each event and the combined effect of the earth s rotation and revolution must be taken into account .",
    "this poses no principal difficulty and will not change our conclusions .",
    "the hard scattering process @xmath81 ( [ eq : nc - amplitude ] ) with subsequent decays @xmath106 has the drell - yan process @xmath107 with photon radiation and @xmath108 with @xmath109 as irreducible backgrounds .",
    "both have been taken into account in our calculation .    as explained in section  [ sec : xsect ] , the unpolarized azimuthal distribution in @xmath110 is flat .",
    "we suppress this background by requiring @xmath111 in order to also reduce the radiative drell - yan events , we have applied an angular separation cut of @xmath112 ( cf .",

    "the average momentum fraction of the light valence quarks is much higher than that of the anti - quarks which exist only in the sea . as a result",
    ", all @xmath114-events will be boosted strongly in the direction of the quark .",
    "therefore we can enrich our samples of signal events by requiring a minimal boost in the appropriate direction .",
    "we have found that demanding the momenta of both the photon and the lepton pair to lie in the _ same _ hemisphere in the laboratory frame , that is @xmath120 produces a nice signal , as displayed in fig .",
