    "the electron - bunch bombardment of solids and transit of the bunches through diaphragms allow to generate short high - power pulses which are widely used for radiolocation  @xcite .",
    "the effect of transition radiation of anharmonic non - stationary electromagnetic pulses in free space and in a dispersive medium was investigated in ref .  .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the longitudinal profile of the bunch density and the plasma parameters can be determined from the values of the radiated fields and their derivatives near the leading edge of the resulting signal .",
    "the transition radiation of surface electromagnetic waves by a non - relativistic electron bunch which crosses the vacuum - semiconductor interface or a thin plate of a semiconductor was studied in ref .  , and now the radiation of modulated electron beams crossing a boundary of a plasma - like medium becomes a very effective method for generation of surface electromagnetic waves  @xcite .",
    "the properties of the transition radiation by the electrons crossing anisotropic conducting interfaces , such as a wire shield , have been studied in ref  .",
    "specifically , the possibility of obtaining an elliptical polarization of electromagnetic waves has been shown in this paper .",
    "pafomov  @xcite predicted the cherenkov radiation of the electromagnetic waves with negative group velocity in media which possesse simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability ( so - called , left - handed media ) .",
    "a similar effect occurs if an electron crosses an interface between the vacuum and a uniaxial anisotropic conducting medium ( e.g. , a layered superconductor ) in the case when _ the conducting layers are parallel to the interface _  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic waves in layered superconductors ( so - called , josephson plasma waves ) belong to the terahertz frequency range , which is very important for various applications , but not easily accessible with modern electronic and optical devices .",
    "this technological perspective provides a strong motivation for studying these waves .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the transition radiation produced by an electron entering ( or escaping from ) a layered superconductor _ with layers perpendicular to the interface_. we have studied in detail the strongly - anisotropic angular distribution of the radiation energy flux and have shown that , in this geometry , unlike the results of ref .  , the excitation of the electromagnetic waves with negative group velocity is impossible . in other words , the directions of the electron motion and of the energy flux in the superconductor",

    "a remarkable feature of the cherenkov radiation in a layered superconductor is that , contrary to the isotropic case , the cherenkov radiation distinctly manifests itself in the angular dependence of the radiation energy flux .",
    "we have found that the electron transit from a dielectric to a layered superconductor results not only in the generation of _ bulk josephson plasma waves _ , but also in the excitation of _ oblique surface electromagnetic waves _ ( osws ) .",
    "we show that osws with frequencies close to the josephson plasma frequency @xmath0 provide the main contribution to the osws energy flux",

    ", @xmath24 can be excluded from the set of equations for the electromagnetic fields , and the electrodynamics of layered superconductors can be described in terms of an anisotropic frequency - dependent permittivity with components @xmath25 and @xmath26 across and along the layers , respectively . indeed , as was shown in ref .",

    "the total electromagnetic field in each medium can be presented as a sum of the so - called electron s field and radiation field .",
    "the first of them represents a particular solution of the inhomogeneous maxwell equations , while the latter is the solution of the homogeneous set of equations .",

    "it is difficult to observe the radiation field inside the layered superconductor , and , therefore , below we analyze the electromagnetic fields only in the dielectric ( e.g. , in the vacuum ) .",
    "the expressions for all components of the total radiation field in the dielectric are presented in appendix c.    in order to derive the spatial and temporal dependences of the total electromagnetic fields in explicit form , we need to integrate expressions ( c1c6 ) in appendix c over @xmath53 and @xmath55 by means of the stationary - phase method for double integrals  @xcite . using this method , we obtain the following quite clear result for the stationary points : @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the tilt angle with respect to the @xmath9-axis ( i.e. , the angle between the radius vector @xmath74 and the @xmath9-axis ) , @xmath1 is the azimuth angle in the interface plane ( i.e. , the angle between the radius vector @xmath75 and the @xmath7-axis ) ( see fig .
