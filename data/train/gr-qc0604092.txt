    "understanding the nature and origin of the apparent dark matter responsible for the bulk of the gravitational mass of galaxies and clusters is one of the most important challenges in modern cosmology .",
    "although many candidates have been proposed for the required weakly interacting cold dark matter @xcite , to date there has been no convincing detection of a suitable particle candidate . for this reason",
    "there is considerable interest in a recent proposal @xcite that accurate modeling of galactic dynamics using general relativity is consistent with observed flat rotation curves and luminous mass without the need for additional dark matter . in this scenario ,",
    "the authors assume a cylindrical stationary space - time containing pressureless dust and solve the weak - field einstein equation to first order in the gravitational constant @xmath0 to obtain the associated velocity distribution as described below .    at first glance",
    ", this would seem to be a compelling solution to the dark matter problem .",
    "however , objections have already been raised by several authors , on a various grounds .",
    "these include the conditions at @xmath1 @xcite , general approximation principles @xcite , and specific analysis of the approximations used @xcite .",
    "the original authors have responded to some of these criticisms @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we suggest yet another possible problem with this interpretation of the dark - matter problem .",
    "we reanalyze the galactic rotation curve as in @xcite and find that the model , as applied , contains an implied large ( infinite ) mass distribution extending beyond the observed galactic disk , and hence at best has simply moved the dark - matter to the outer galaxy , and more likely , the model is ruled out on energetic grounds .",
    "our goal is to analyze the implied mass distribution in the cooperstock & tieu @xcite model . in order to deduce this",
    "we first summarize their approach . in their analysis of rotation curves ,",
    "the galaxy to be described is treated as a uniformly rotating axisymmetric system containing pressureless fluid .",
    "the general stationary axially symmetric metric is chosen of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are functions of cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the metric coefficient @xmath3 is taken to be unity . in a co - moving frame the the fluid four - velocity is just @xmath9 making a local ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 held fixed ) transformation to @xmath10 diagonalizes the metric and , in the weak field limit , leads to simple approximations for the local angular velocity @xmath11 and the tangential velocity @xmath12 : @xmath13    the einstein field equations to first order in the gravitational constant @xmath0 are easily combined to yield a poisson - like equation for @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15    the geodesic equation @xmath16 together with the adopted metric and four - velocity ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) simply becomes @xmath17 and hence @xmath18 within the fluid .",
    "the interior equations for @xmath19 and @xmath6 then become : @xmath20 @xmath21 eq . ( [ eq9a ] ) can be expressed as @xmath22 where @xmath23 hence , flat - space harmonic functions @xmath24 become the generators of the axially symmetric stationary pressure - free weak fields . using ( [ eq4 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq10a ] ) , the tangential velocity distribution becomes @xmath25 since the field equation for @xmath19 is non - linear , the galactic rotation is deduced by first finding the required generating potential @xmath24 and from this the appropriate function @xmath6 for the galaxy is deduced .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq9b ] ) yields the density distribution .",
    "each galaxy analyzed requires its own composing elements to build the generating potential .",
    "a separation of variables yields a solution for @xmath24 in terms of bessel functions @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the general solution is expressed as a linear superposition @xmath29 with @xmath30 chosen appropriately for the desired level of accuracy . from ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) ,",
    "the tangential velocity is @xmath31    this expression was used in @xcite to fit the rotation curve for the milky way . in this paper",
    "we analyze this fit and show that any fit implies a large mass at larger radii .",
    "hence , this approach does not solve the dark matter problem , but has merely moved to dark matter to large radii .",
    "worse , we now have an excess mass problem !",
    "figure [ fig : vel500 ] reproduces the velocity curve fit for the milky way given in @xcite , but extended to larger radius . the large oscillations in velocity although alarming , are rendered harmless if the density is sufficiently low .",
    "figure [ fig : density100 ] shows the extended density profile .",
    "it would be tempting to assume from this that the density could be cutoff at the limits of the observed galaxy .",
    "however , we show that for any velocity fit the total mass is infinite , in contrast to the original claim of finite integrated mass .",
    "in fact , smoothed out , the enclosed mass rises linearly with radius .",
    "velocity @xmath32 as a function of radius @xmath33,width=302 ]     density @xmath34 as a function of radius @xmath33,width=377 ]",
    "to obtain the total implied galactic mass , consider a model with a single value of @xmath35 , @xmath36 eq ( [ eq9b ] ) written for density is @xmath37 in this case @xmath38 we note @xmath39 as @xmath40 , illustrated in figure [ fig : rdensityk ] .",
    "@xmath41 as a function of radius @xmath33 , @xmath42,width=377 ]    the mass element is @xmath43 so the mass enclosed within cylindrical coordinate r is @xmath44 r~~ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this case @xmath45 clearly rises linearly .",
    "now we look at the general case .",
    "taking our cue from eq.([eq : m ] ) , @xmath41 is plotted against @xmath7 for the milky way model using two different scales of extended range , shown in figures [ fig : rdensity100 ] , [ fig : rdensity1000 ] .",
    "@xmath41 as a function of radius @xmath33 , @xmath42,width=377 ]     @xmath41 as a function of radius @xmath33 , @xmath42,width=377 ]    it appears that @xmath41 oscillates around a positive average value .",
    "if the @xmath8 dependence were independent of @xmath7 like that in the single @xmath35 case , this would imply that @xmath45 tends to rise linearly in the limit of large @xmath7 .",
    "the following analysis shows this is the case , even though the @xmath8 dependence is not simple .    if we can find @xmath46 such that for large enough @xmath7 @xmath47 and @xmath48 then @xmath49 for large enough @xmath7 .",
    "to find @xmath50 , for fixed @xmath7 define @xmath51 from ( [ eq : density ] ) , @xmath52 with coefficients @xmath53 determined by the model .",
    "note @xmath54 .",
    "define @xmath50 as the minimum over all sets @xmath55 , in any model , of the integral , @xmath56 @xmath57 since otherwise @xmath58 and continuity of @xmath59 imply @xmath60 , a contradiction .",
    "+   + to find @xmath61 first find the form of the density for @xmath1 using ( [ eq : density ] ) , @xmath62/r^2 , \\ ] ]    with coefficients determined by the model . so as @xmath40 @xmath63 \\\\        & \\rightarrow & \\left ( \\sum_k   a_k \\sin{kr } \\right)^2 + \\left ( \\sum_k   b_k \\cos{kr } \\right)^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with a re - scaling of the coefficients .",
    "so the integral @xmath64 the first sum consists of a piece linear in @xmath7 plus an oscillating piece , while the second sum is purely oscillating .",
    "the oscillations are all bounded , so overall the required @xmath65 exists , and @xmath45 behaves as predicted .",
    "despite the close fit to observed velocity curves over the galatic range , we find that the total enclosed mass in the model of cooperstock and tieu rises as a linearly increasing function of radius .",
    "this indicates that the model has not removed the dark matter problem , but has merely moved the mass to large radius .",
    "moreover , the implied infinite mass , and large velocity fields suggest that this interpretation is probably not realistic .",
