    "zipf s law is the observation that the frequency @xmath0 of the occurrence of various events is an inverse power - law function @xmath1 , where the rank @xmath2 is determined by the descending order of the frequency of each event.@xcite zipf first made this observation for the frequency of occurrence of english words in literature ; that is , the most frequent word the  ( rank @xmath3 ) appears twice as many times as the second most frequent word of(rank @xmath4 ) .",
    "since then , zipf s law has been found in various fields , including the population of cities@xcite and the asset distribution of companies.@xcite for example , zipf s law for income distribution asserts that the size and number of companies are in inverse proportion ; that is , the number of companies that have more than @xmath5 assets is one - tenth of the number of companies that have more than @xmath6 .",
    "this universality of zipf s law , however , has not been well explained theoretically . to date , we have only models specific to each problem .",
    "@xcite    in the present paper , we introduce a simple and generic model that reproduces zipf s law .",
    "we can regard this model both as the time evolution of the asset distribution and that of the population of cities .",
    "we also explain theoretically why this model reproduces zipf s law .",
    "our explanation shows that zipf s law of our model is very robust .",
    "in this section we introduce our model and the results of its simulation .",
    "the model that we introduce here evolves as follows : first , we consider a set of positive values @xmath7 with @xmath8 entities",
    ". these values may be the assets of @xmath8 companies or the population of @xmath8 cities . for simplicity , we assume that the initial values of @xmath7 are all equal",
    ". then we repeat the following procedures @xmath9 times :    1 .",
    "choose an entity @xmath10 randomly from @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath12",
    ", we move the amount @xmath13 from the @xmath14th entity to the @xmath10th entity , where @xmath15 is a constant parameter with @xmath16 .",
    "in other words @xmath17 this procedure may be regarded as a deal between two companies or population movement between two cities . for @xmath18",
    ", we increase all values @xmath7 by the same amount @xmath19 .",
    "3 .   rearrange the entities in the descending order of the values @xmath7 .",
    "let us explain this model from the viewpoint of asset distribution .",
    "we focus on the hierarchical structure of the companies .",
    "assume that a company will tend to trade with a company of similar size .",
    "that is , money flows from one company to a smaller company and the smaller company delivers products to the larger company .",
    "hence , in our model , money flows from high - rank companies to low - rank companies as in eqs.([xm ] ) and ( [ xp ] ) .    ;",

    "the number of the companies is @xmath26 . in every case ,",
    "the model reproduces zipf s law as @xmath27 .",
    "we see that the parameter @xmath15 is related to the rapidity of the convergence to zipf s law . in fig.[asset](a )",
    "( @xmath28 ) the distribution evolves slowly , but eventually converges to zipf s law .",
    "in this section we give a theoretical explanation as to why the model in the previous section reproduces zipf s law .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath29 . then",
    ", the value of the @xmath10th entity is nearly equal to the value of the @xmath14th entity , that is @xmath30 .",
    "hence we regard the set of variables @xmath7 as a continuous variable @xmath6 .",
    "we consider in this limit the time evolution of the probability distribution function of @xmath6 .",
    "we note that eqs.([xm ] ) and ( [ xp ] ) give probability flows in the directions @xmath31 the evolution equation of @xmath32 is therefore the following : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the probability distribution of @xmath6 at time @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a certain constant .",
    "the first term is a flow from the point @xmath6 to the points @xmath37 , while the second and third terms are flows from @xmath38 into @xmath6 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 in front of @xmath0 in eq.([x ] ) are necessary in order to satisfy the probability conservation . to see this , we integrate eq.([x ] ) over @xmath6 as @xmath40 changing the variables",
    "to be @xmath41 we can rewrite eq.([int ] ) as @xmath42 thus , the total probability is conserved .    to see eq.([x ] ) from a different point of view , we change the variable to be @xmath43 .",
    "the probability distribution function is transformed to @xmath44 in other words , we define @xmath45 by rewriting @xmath0 in terms of @xmath46 as @xmath47 we transform the evolution equation ( [ x ] ) to @xmath48 where @xmath49    we can see the evolution equation ( [ xi ] ) as a random walk from @xmath50 to ( @xmath51 ) , that is , a random walk with a fixed step size .",
    "although we can solve eq.([xi ] ) exactly , it is obvious even without solving it that the stationary solution is given by @xmath52constant as @xmath53 .",
    "changing the variable back to @xmath54 , we have @xmath55 as @xmath53 , or zipf s law .    from the above viewpoint",
    ", the resulting distribution always obeys zipf s law as long as the diffusion of @xmath6 is uniform in the logarithmic scale .",
    "we can thus generalize the model in @xmath562 extensively .",
    "we assumed in @xmath562 that a chosen entity is given some value from the entity one rank higher in the model , but this is not necessary .",
    "the model reproduces zipf s law as long as there is a flow @xmath57 proportional to its size .",
    "for example , the following procedure ( the nonconservative model  ) also reproduces zipf s law :    1 .",
    "choose an entity @xmath10 randomly from @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   give or reduce randomly the amount @xmath57 from the chosen entity : @xmath58    the simulation of the above procedure yields fig.[zipfex](a ) .",
    "it is even unnecessary to make @xmath15 a fixed value ; choosing @xmath15 randomly from @xmath59 at each step in this nonconservative model , we obtain similar results to those shown in fig.[zipfex](b ) . in this case , however , we need to bind the diffusion of @xmath6 ; otherwise , @xmath60 as @xmath53 . in fig.[zipfex](b ) , we set the limit @xmath61 .",
