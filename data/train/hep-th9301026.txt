    "have drawn particular attention .",
    "pasquier showed , in fact , that to any arbitrary graph one can associate a solvable restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model .",
    "requiring criticality led to the restriction to graphs which are dynkin diagrams of the simply - laced a - d - e lie algebras .",
    "an important feature of the a - d - e models is that they can all be mapped onto the same polygon or loop model , which in turn is equivalent to the 6-vertex model .",
    "recently , by extending pasquier s and similar methods of owczareck and baxter @xcite , warnaar _ et al . _ @xcite found a new family of models associated with graphs . via a different approach",
    "these same models were also found by roche @xcite , who suggested the name dilute a - d - e models .",
    "again , the whole family of dilute a - d - e models can be mapped onto a single loop model , the o@xmath3 model @xcite , which is related to the 19-vertex vertex model of izergin and korepin @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we further exploit the relation between rsos models related to graphs and loop models .",
    "we define a general multi - colour loop ( mcl ) model and show its equivalence with a rsos model defined by arbitrary sets of graphs .",
    "then we consider several examples for which these models are actually solvable , and find , besides the known a - d - e and dilute a - d - e models , new families of critical rsos models labelled by dynkin diagrams . as a further generalisation we also consider models of mixed loop - vertex type",
    ". finally , for one of the examples , related to the c@xmath4 lie algebra , we present an off - critical extension .",
    "this extension has the property that it breaks the z@xmath2 symmetry of the underlying dynkin diagrams . in the appendix",
    "we describe the ybe for loop models @xcite and show how it relates to the ybe for the rsos model .",
    "we consider a square lattice @xmath5 .",
    "each edge of @xmath5 can either be occupied by a line segment , that has one of @xmath6 possible colours , or be empty .",
    "line segments of equal colour on adjoining edges must form closed polygons or loops .",
    "a configuration @xmath7 is defined as a collection of coloured loops on @xmath5 , with the restriction that polygons of the same colour do not intersect .",
    "an example of a configuration is given in figure  [ loopsoup ] .",
    "the total number of allowed vertices @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 .",
    "for @xmath10 and @xmath11 all possible vertices are shown in figure  [ 23vertices](a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "a loop of colour @xmath12 has fugacity @xmath13 and the boltzmann weight of vertex @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 .",
    "the partition function of the mcl model is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the total number of loops of colour @xmath12 and @xmath18 the number of vertices of type @xmath14 . for @xmath10",
    "the mcl model coincides with the loop model defined in @xcite .",
    "if the weights @xmath19 are all zero , only configurations that densely cover the entire lattice give a non - zero contribution to the partition function .",
    "such loop models we call _ dense _ , opposed to so - called _ dilute _ loop models which allow for edges of @xmath5 to be unoccupied .    in this section",
    "we define a restricted solid - on - solid model and show that its partition function equals that of the multi - colour loop model .",
    "consider an arbitrary connected graph @xmath20 .",
    "such a graph consists of a set of @xmath21 nodes , labelled by an integer _ height _",
    "@xmath22 and a number of bonds between the nodes .",
    "we do not allow more than one bond between two nodes .",
    "two nodes are called adjacent @xmath23 on @xmath20 if they are connected via a single a bond .",
    "a graph is called simple if it has no nodes connected to themselves .",
    "examples of simple and non - simple connected graphs are shown in figure  [ adediagrams ] and [ tadpoles ] respectively .",
    "we can represent the graph @xmath20 by an adjacency matrix @xmath24 as follows @xmath25 we denote the largest eigenvalue of @xmath24 by @xmath26 and the corresponding eigenvector by @xmath27 .",
    "we now take @xmath6 such arbitrary graphs , labelled @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be the @xmath6-dimensional vector @xmath30 and define @xmath31 where we use the convention that sums and products over @xmath12 and @xmath32 always range from 1 to @xmath6 . with the above definitions the boltzmann weight of an elementary face of the rsos model",
    "is defined as @xmath33 where the @xmath12-th component of the _ height _ vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 can take any of the @xmath21 heights on @xmath20 .",
    "the generalised kronecker @xmath36 and the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 used above are given by @xmath39 with @xmath40 the step function : @xmath41 we note that the total number of terms in equation ( [ rsos ] ) is @xmath8 .    in analogy with the mcl model , if @xmath19 are all zero , we name the rsos model dense . for such models ,",
    "if all adjacency graphs are simple , neighbouring sites of the lattice must have different height .",
    "so - called dilute rsos models allow for neighbouring sites of @xmath5 to have equal height .    as will become clear in the following , we require for dilute rsos models that all @xmath6 adjacency graphs are simple .",
    "we now show that the partition function of the rsos model , given by @xmath42 where the product is over all faces of the square lattice @xmath5 , can be mapped onto that of the mcl model .",
    "the method is a straightforward generalisation of the work of pasquier @xcite , owczarek and baxter @xcite and warnaar _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .    as a first step we substitute the expression for",
    "the boltzmann weight ( [ rsos ] ) and expand the above partition function into a sum over @xmath43 terms , where @xmath44 is the number of faces of the lattice .",
    "for each face of @xmath5 , a given term in the expansion has one of the @xmath8 terms of equation ( [ rsos ] ) .",
    "these @xmath8 possible terms can be represented diagrammatically as shown in figure  [ 23vertices](a ) and ( b ) for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 case respectively .",
    "a line of colour @xmath12 , separating two neighbouring sites with heights @xmath29 and @xmath45 respectively , implies @xmath46 we now have to distinguish between dense and dilute rsos models .    for dilute rsos models ,",
    "since we do not allow for non - simple graphs , all diagonal elements of the @xmath6 adjacency matrices are zero .",
    "consequently , @xmath47 means that @xmath48 , and hence that a line separating two neighbouring sites can be viewed as a domain wall separating two neighbouring sites with different heights . as a results of this and the @xmath36-functions in ( [ rsos ] ) , only configurations in which lines of the same colour join together , to form domain walls separating regions of the lattice with different height ,",
    "give a non - zero contribution to the partition function . a typical configuration",
    "is shown in figure  [ loopsoup ] .",
    "if we had allowed for non - simple graphs , configurations where domain walls would simply end somewhere on the lattice would not give a vanishing contribution .",
    "for dense rsos models we do not have this complication .",
    "all edges of the lattice are occupied by polygon segments and domain walls therefore can not end . besides simple graphs",
    ", we can now allow for non - simple adjacency graphs as well .",
    "if adjacency graph @xmath20 is non - simple , a line of colour @xmath12 separating two neighbouring sites does not necessarily separate two sites with different height .",
    "for simplicity we will still refer to such a line as a ( local ) domain wall . due to the @xmath36-functions we again have that only configurations in which lines of the same colour join together , to form global domain walls , give a non - zero contribution to the partition function .",
    "the partition function is now given as the sum over all configurations @xmath7 of domain walls and a sum over heights consistent with @xmath7 @xmath49 where we have used the factorisation property ( [ factorise ] ) of @xmath50 and the meaning of a domain wall of colour @xmath12 , as formulated in ( [ restriction ] ) .",
    "the integer @xmath51 denotes the total power of @xmath52 arising from the vertices of type @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where we count the powers of @xmath52 and @xmath55 separately .    to avoid technical difficulties , we assume that all boundary sites of @xmath5 carry the same height vector .",
    "( for the treatment of other boundary conditions see @xcite . )",
    "all domain walls then form closed polygons or loops .",
    "polygons may of course surround other polygons of any colour , but can only be intersected by polygons of a different colour .",
    "if a polygon of colour @xmath12 is intersected by other polygons , the height vectors immediately inside and outside this polygon are not unique .",
    "however , the @xmath12-th component of these vectors does have a unique value .",
    "we call these the inner and outer height of the polygon respectively .",
    "we now make the following decomposition : @xmath56 where the labels @xmath12 and @xmath32 in the diagrams denote colours . as a result ,",
    "the total contribution to @xmath57 of a polygon of colour @xmath12 , with inner height @xmath58 and outer height @xmath59 is always 1 .",
    "we can now perform the summation over the height vectors in ( [ zexpand ] ) for each component independently .",
    "when summing over the @xmath12 height components , we start with polygons of colour @xmath12 which do not surround other polygons of the same colour . if such a polygon has inner height @xmath58 and outer height @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 the result is that these polygons contribute a factor @xmath26 and that their dependence on the outer height @xmath59 disappears .",
    "therefore , the summation over the @xmath12-th height component of the regions immediately outside these polygons can now be performed in the same way . repeating this process from inside out and we obtain , after completely summing out the @xmath12-th height component , @xmath61 where @xmath17 is the number of polygons of colour @xmath12 .",
    "if we perform the summation for all @xmath6 height components , and make the identification @xmath62 we find that the partition function of the rsos model is that of the mcl model .",
    "the equivalence between the partition functions of the mcl and rsos model holds irrespective of the solvability of the models .",
    "clearly , as a consequence of the equivalence , if either one of the models is solvable , in the sense that we can compute its partition function , the other model is solvable as well . in the appendix",
    "we show that if the mcl model satisfies the ybe , then , as an immediate consequence , the ybe for the rsos model holds as well .",
    "we now consider several special cases for which the mcl model and hence the rsos model is solvable . by a solvable mcl model we mean that it satisfies the ybe for loop models @xcite , which is described in some detail in appendix  [ ybloop ] .",
    "two of these cases are already known in the literature and are only presented for completeness .",
    "all examples are either 1- , or 2-colour loop models .",
    "so far we have not been able to find any non - trivial solvable mcl model with more than two colours .    in appendix",
    "a we give an alternative equivalence between the mcl model and the rsos model on the level of the ybe .",

    "we substitute the definition of the weights @xmath148 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 , where @xmath155 and @xmath156 are given by ( [ rsos ] ) with @xmath15 replaced by @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and expand both sides of the ybe into @xmath159 terms .",
    "we then use the factorisation ( [ factorise ] ) and perform the trivial summation over the @xmath36-functions . as a result , most terms in the expansion no longer contain the variable @xmath160 . only terms",
    "for which the internal site differs in height from all its three neighbouring sites , which in that case all have equal height , yield a @xmath160 dependent factor of the form @xmath161 . here",
    "@xmath160 and @xmath58 are the @xmath162th height components of the center site and its neighbouring sites respectively , and @xmath163 , @xmath164 @xmath165 .",
    "performing the sum over @xmath160 yields a factor @xmath26 , see equation ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "we now group together all terms that have the same dependence on the vectors @xmath27 .",
    "if we demand that the resulting equation holds for any arbitrary set of graphs @xmath166 , a sufficient and presumably necessary condition is that each group of terms vanishes independently .",
    "if we draw domain walls ( of the appropriate colour ) between regions of different height , terms within the same group all have the same connectivity .",
    "furthermore , a term with an internal loop of colour @xmath12 contributes an extra factor @xmath26 . as a result we find , upon setting @xmath62 , that each group yields precisely one of the equations of the ybe for the mcl model .",
