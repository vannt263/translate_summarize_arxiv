    "we consider the external field model of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) or no - photon qed which describes a dirac sea of electrons evolving subject to a prescribed external electromagnetic four - vector potential @xmath0 . to infer the evolution operator of this model one attempts to implement the one - particle dirac evolution @xmath1 in second - quantized form . here",
    ", @xmath2 denotes the mass of the electron ; the elementary charge of the electron @xmath3 ( having a negative sign in the case of an electron ) is already absorbed in @xmath4 ; units are chosen such that @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the employed relativistic notation is introduced with all other notations in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] . for sake of simplicity",
    "we will restrict us to smooth and compactly supported @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath7 although this condition is unnecessarily strong .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that , on standard fock space and for equal - time hyperplanes , a second quantization of the one particle dirac evolution is possible if and only if @xmath8 , i.e. , the spatial components of the external field vanish  a condition that appears strange in view of gauge invariance . in physics",
    "the ill - definedness of the evolution operator and its generator for general vector potentials @xmath4 is usually ignored at first which later manifests itself in the appearance of infinities in informal perturbation series .",
    "those infinities have to be taken out by hand or , as for example in the case of the vacuum expectation value of the charge current , absorbed in the coefficient of the electron charge . nevertheless , since the sole interaction arises only from a prescribed four - vector field one",
    "may rather expect that it should be possible to control the time evolution non - perturbatively .",
    "one way to construct a well - defined second - quantized time evolution operator , as sketched in @xcite , is to implement it between time - varying fock spaces .",
    "such constructions have been carried out , e.g. , in @xcite . while the idea of changing fock spaces might be unfamiliar as seen from the non - relativistic setting , in a relativistic formulation it is to be expected .",
    "a lorentz boost for instance may tilt an equal - time hyperplane to a space - like space - like hyperplane @xmath9 , which requires a change from standard hilbert space @xmath10 to one attached to @xmath9 , and likewise , for the corresponding fock spaces .    in this work",
    "we extend the existing constructions in @xcite , which deal exclusively with equal - time hyperplanes , by implementing the second - quantized dirac evolution from one cauchy surface to another .",
    "the resulting formulation of external field qed has several advantages : 1 ) its lorentz and gauge covariance can be made explicit ; 2 ) as it treats the initial value problem for general cauchy surfaces it allows to study the evolution in the form of local deformations of cauchy surfaces in the spirit of tomonaga and schwinger , e.g. , @xcite ; 3 ) it gives a geometric and more general version of the implementability condition @xmath8 that was found in the special case of equal - time hyperplanes .    before presenting our main results in section  [ sec : main ] we outline the construction of the evolution operator for general space - like cauchy surfaces .",
    "given a cauchy surface @xmath9 in minkowski space - time ( see definition  [ def : cauchy - surface ] below ) , the states of the dirac sea on @xmath9 are represented by vectors in a conveniently chosen fock space , here , denoted by the symbol @xmath11 . in this notation @xmath12 is the hilbert space of @xmath13-valued , square integrable functions on @xmath9 ( see definition  [ def : hsigma ] below ) and @xmath14 is one of its polarizations :    let @xmath15 denote the set of all closed , linear subspaces @xmath16 such that @xmath17 and @xmath18 are both infinite dimensional . any @xmath19 is called a _ polarization _ of @xmath12 . for @xmath19 ,",
    "let @xmath20 denote the orthogonal projection of @xmath12 onto @xmath17 .",
    "the fock space corresponding to polarization @xmath17 on cauchy surface @xmath9 is then defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the hilbert space direct sum , @xmath23 the antisymmetric tensor product of hilbert spaces , and @xmath24 denotes the conjugate complex vector space of @xmath17 , which coincides with @xmath17 as a set and has the same vector space operations as @xmath17 with the exception of the scalar multiplication , which is redefined by @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "each polarization @xmath17 splits the hilbert space @xmath12 into a direct sum , i.e. , @xmath28 .",
    "the so - called standard polarizations @xmath29 and @xmath30 are determined by the orthogonal projectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 onto the free positive and negative energy dirac solutions , respectively , restricted to @xmath9 : @xmath33 loosely speaking , in terms of dirac s hole theory , the polarization @xmath14 indicates the `` sea level '' of the dirac sea , and electron wave functions in @xmath18 and @xmath17 are considered to be `` above '' and `` below '' sea level , respectively .",
    "however , it has to be stressed that the mathematical structure of the external field problem in qed does not seem to discriminate between particular choices of polarizations @xmath17 . hence ,",
    "unless an additional physical condition is delivered , the @xmath17-dependent labels `` electron '' and `` positron '' are somewhat arbitrary , and @xmath17 should rather be regarded as a choice of coordinate system w.r.t .  which the states of the dirac sea are represented . to describe pair - creation on the other hand it is necessary to have a distinguished @xmath17 , and the common ( and seemingly most natural ) ad hoc choice in situations when the external field vanishes is @xmath34 .",
    "nevertheless , it is conceivable that only a yet to be found full version of qed , including the interaction with the photon field , may distinguish particular polarizations @xmath17 in general situations .    given two cauchy surfaces @xmath35 and two polarizations @xmath14 and @xmath36 a sensible lift of the one - particle dirac evolution @xmath37 ( see definition  [ def : ua ] ) should be given by a unitary operator @xmath38 that fulfills @xmath39 here , @xmath40 denotes the dirac field operator corresponding to fock space @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 here , @xmath43 denote the annihilation and creation operators on the @xmath18 and @xmath44 sectors of @xmath45 , respectively . note that @xmath46 is _ anti - linear _ ; thus , @xmath47 is anti - linear in its argument @xmath48 .",
    "the condition under which such a lift @xmath49 exists can be inferred from a straight - forward application of shale and stinespring s well - known theorem @xcite :    [ thm : shale - stinespring ] the following statements are equivalent :    1 .   there is a unitary operator @xmath50 which fulfills .",
    "2 .   the off - diagonals @xmath51 and @xmath52 are hilbert - schmidt operators .",
    "note that the phase of the lift is not fixed by condition .",
    "even worse , as indicated earlier , depending on the external field @xmath4 this condition is not always satisfied ; see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the choices made for the polarizations @xmath17 and @xmath53 were completely arbitrary .",
    "we shall see next that adapting these choices carefully will however yield an evolution of the dirac sea in the corresponding fock space representations .",
    "there is a trivial but not so useful choice .",
    "pick a @xmath54 in the remote past of the support of @xmath4 fulfilling @xmath55 then the choices @xmath56 and @xmath57 fulfill ( b ) of theorem  [ thm : shale - stinespring ] as the off - diagonals are zero .",
    "the drawback of these choices is that the resulting lift depends on the whole history of @xmath4 between @xmath54 and @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , such @xmath17 and @xmath53 are rather implicit .",
    "but statement ( b ) in theorem  [ thm : shale - stinespring ] also allows to differ from the projectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 by a hilbert - schmidt operator .",
    "hence , it lies near to characterize polarizations according to the following classes :    [ def : pol - classes ] for a cauchy surface @xmath9 we define @xmath60_{\\approx } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where for @xmath61 , @xmath62 means that @xmath63 , i.e. , is a hilbert - schmidt operator @xmath64 .    the equivalence relation @xmath65 can be refined to give another equivalence relation @xmath66 describing polarization classes of equal charge ; c.f .",
    "@xcite and remark  [ rem : approx_0 ] . as a simple corollary of theorem  [ thm : shale - stinespring ] one",
    "gets :    [ thm : evolution - lift ] let @xmath35 be cauchy surfaces .",
    "then any choice @xmath67 and @xmath68 implies condition ( b ) of theorem  [ thm : shale - stinespring ] and therefore the existence of a lift @xmath38 obeying .",
    "consequently , any choice @xmath67 and @xmath68 gives rise to a lift of the one - particle dirac evolution between the corresponding @xmath11 and @xmath69 that is unique up to a phase .",
    "the crucial questions are : 1 ) on which properties of @xmath4 and @xmath9 do these polarization classes depend ?",
    "2 ) how do they behave under lorentz and gauge transforms ?",
    "3 ) is there an explicit representative for each class ? these question will be answered by our main results given in the next section .",
    "the next important question is about the unidentified phase .",
    "although transition probabilities are independent of this phase , dynamic quantities like the charge current will depend directly on it .",
    "we briefly discuss this in section  [ sec : outlook ] and give an outlook of what needs to be done to derive the vacuum expectation of the polarization current .",
    "the definition   of the physical polarization classes involves the one - particle dirac evolution operator and is therefore not very useful in finding an explicit description of admissible fock spaces for the implementation of the second - quantized dirac evolution . in our main results theorems  [ thm : ident - pol - class]-[thm : representative ]",
    "we give a more direct identification of the polarization classes classes @xmath70 and state some of their fundamental geometric properties .",
    "the first one ensures that the classes @xmath70 are independent of the history of @xmath4 , instead they depend on the tangential components of @xmath4 on @xmath9 only .",
    "[ thm : ident - pol - class ] let @xmath9 be a cauchy surface and let @xmath4 and @xmath71 be two smooth and compactly supported external fields . then @xmath72 where @xmath73 means that for all @xmath74 and @xmath75 we have @xmath76 .",
    "ruijsenaar s result , see @xcite , may be viewed as the special case of this theorem pertaining to @xmath77 and , for @xmath78 fixed , @xmath79 being an equal - time hyperplane .",
    "furthermore , the polarization classes transform naturally under lorentz and gauge transformations :    [ thm : lorentz - gauge ] let @xmath14 be a polarization .",

    "@xmath84 for some @xmath85 given by the multiplication operator @xmath86 , @xmath87 .",
    "then : @xmath88    as we are mainly interested in a _ local _",
    "study of the second - quantized dirac evolution , we only allow compactly supported vector potentials @xmath4 , and therefore , have to restrict the gauge transformations @xmath89 to compactly supported @xmath90 as well . treating more general vector potentials @xmath4 and gauge transforms @xmath89 would require an analysis of decay properties at infinity which is not our focus here .",
    "finally , given cauchy surface @xmath9 , there is an explicit representative of the equivalence class of polarizations @xmath70 which can be given in terms of a compact , skew - adjoint linear operator @xmath91 , as defined in below .",
    "with it the polarization class can be identified as follows :    [ thm : representative ] given cauchy surface @xmath9 , we have @xmath92_{\\approx}$ ] .",
    "other representatives for polarization classes @xmath70 beyond the `` interpolating representation '' @xmath93 , as used in definition  [ def : pol - classes ] , can be inferred from the so - called furry picture , as worked out for equal - time hyperplanes in @xcite , and from the global constructions of the fermionic projector given in @xcite .",

    ", , and lemma  [ lem : pminus - lambda ] below .    the implications on the physical picture can be seen as follows .",
    "the dirac sea on cauchy surface @xmath9 can be described in any fock space @xmath11 for any choice of polarization @xmath67 .",
    "the polarization class @xmath70 is uniquely determined by the tangential components of the external potential @xmath4 on @xmath9 .",
    "this is an object that transforms covariantly under lorentz and gauge transformations .",
    "the choice of the particular polarization can then be seen as a `` choice of coordinates '' in which the dirac sea is described . when regarding the dirac evolution from one cauchy surface @xmath9 to @xmath94 another `` choice of coordinates '' @xmath68 has to be made .",
    "then one yields an evolution operator @xmath95 which is unique up to an arbitrary phase corollary  [ thm : evolution - lift ] .",
    "transition probabilities of the kind @xmath96 for @xmath97 and @xmath98 are well - defined and unique without the need of a renormalization method .",
    "finally , for a family of cauchy surfaces @xmath99 that interpolates smoothly between @xmath9 and @xmath94 we also give an infinitesimal version of how the external potential @xmath4 changes the polarization in terms of the flow parameter @xmath78 ; see theorem  [ thm : inf ] below .",
    "[ rem : approx_0 ] given two polarizations @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is a compact operator , e.g. , as in the case @xmath102 as defined in , one can define their relative charge , denoted by @xmath103 , to be the fredholm index of @xmath104 ; cf .",
    "the equivalence relation @xmath65 in the claim of theorem  [ thm : representative ] can then be replaced by the finer equivalence relation @xmath66 , which is defined as follows : @xmath105 if and only if @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this is shown as an addendum to the proof of theorem  [ thm : representative ] .",
    "as indicated at the end of the introduction the current operator depends directly on the unspecified phase of @xmath108 .",
    "this can be seen from bogolyubov s formula @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a cauchy surfaces in the remote future of the support of @xmath4 such that @xmath111 .",
    "hence , without identification of the derivative of the phase of @xmath49 the physical current is not fully specified .",
    "nevertheless , now the situation is slightly better than in the standard perturbative approach . as for each choice of admissible polarizations in @xmath112 and @xmath70 , identified above",
    ", there is a well - defined lift @xmath49 of the dirac evolution operator @xmath113 and therefore also a well - defined current .",
    "now it is only the task to select the physical relevant one .",
    "one way of doing so is to impose extra conditions on the , and hence , the phase , so that the set of admissible phases shrinks to one that produces the same currents up to the known freedom of charge renormalization ; see @xcite . in the case of equal - time hyperplanes a choice of the unidentified phase",
    "was given by parallel transport in @xcite .",
    "on top of the geometric construction and despite the fact that there are still degrees of freedom left , mickelsson s current is particularly interesting because it agrees with conventional perturbation theory up to second order . yet",
    "the open question remains which additional physical requirements may constraint these degree of freedoms up to the one of the numerical value of the elementary charge @xmath3 fixed by the experiment .",
