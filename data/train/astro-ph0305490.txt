    "although the problem of birth rates of radio - pulsars ( psrs ) and supernova remnants ( snrs ) has been discussed for many years , it is still an open question .",
    "the main difficulties in solving this problem are the selection effects in observations .",
    "it is not well known under which circumstances single psrs are born under a supernova ( sn ) explosion .",
    "actually , psrs may be born under sn explosions of types ib , ic and ii ( here we do not consider the accretion induced collapse ) .",
    "snrs are formed as a result of sn explosions with energies 10@xmath11 - 10@xmath12 erg , and in some cases , even with energies several times smaller than 10@xmath11 erg ( e.g. crab , sollerman et al . 2000 ) and with energies @xmath310@xmath12 erg ( e.g. cas a , vink et al . 1998 ; wright et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "according to lorimer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) psrs are formed once every 150 years in the galaxy and the lower limit for the mass of the stars which form psrs at the end of their evolution is about 5 m@xmath13 . by examining the historical snrs , strom ( 1994 ) found that a sn explosion occurs every 6 years in the galaxy and the lower limit for the mass of the progenitors of these snrs is also about 5 m@xmath13 .",
    "there is an unlikely large difference between the birth rate of psrs given by lorimer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and the formation rate of sne given by strom ( 1994 ) .",
    "does the formation of psrs predominantly depend on some other parameters because of the lower limit for the progenitor mass being the same in both cases ?",
    "it is known that in sb - type galaxies rate of sn explosion is similar to the sn rate in our galaxy , @xmath141 - 2 in 100 years on average , because our galaxy also is sb - type .",
    "( van den bergh & tammann 1991 ) .",
    "recent statistical investigations of sn rate in sb - type galaxies show that the rate of sn ia is 0.4@xmath10.2 in 100 years and the rate of sn ii together with sn ib and sn ic is about 1.5@xmath11.0 per century in sb - type galaxies and so in our galaxy ( capellaro et al . 1999 ; capellaro & turatto 2001 ) .    in our galaxy",
    "no evidence was found of a sn explosion in the last 300 years .",
    "the results of optical , radio and x - ray observations of the region up to 5 kpc around the sun showed that there is a very small probability to find a neutron star ( ns ) or a snr with such a small age .",
    "kaspi et al . ( 1999 ) and kaspi & helfand ( 2002 ) give a list of the youngest ( @xmath15@xmath162.44@xmath810@xmath17 yrs ) 17 psrs .",
    "ten of these psrs are genetically connected to snrs .",
    "the opposite of this is not true , i.e. in most of the snrs with such ages no psr has been found .",
    "searching for dim point x - ray sources in nearby snrs is essential to solve this important problem , because after finding point x - ray sources in snrs these point sources can precisely be examined in the radio band .    assuming the lower limit for the mass of the progenitors , which end their evolution with sn explosion , to be 5 or 8 m@xmath13 leads to a difference of a factor of 3 in the formation rate of snrs , if we use the initial mass function ( imf ) of blaha & humphreys ( 1989 ) . even for different galaxies and star formation regions ( sfrs ) we can use a simple imf with a value of power about 2.33 ( schaerer 2002 ) . a lower limit for the mass of progenitors of sn about 7 - 8 m@xmath13 is in accordance with a rate of one sn in 65 years .",
    "it is necessary also to note that the sfrs in our galaxy are not symmetrically located and also the star formation rates vary from one region to another .",
    "it is known that the background radio radiation increases when the line of sight becomes closer to the galactic center direction and the galactic plane .",
    "distribution of the temperature which characterizes the background radiation at 400 mhz is known ( physics of cosmos 1986 ) .",
    "when we compare the intensity ( temperature ) of the background radiation with the structure of the galactic arms ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ; paladini et al .",
    "2003 ) , the effect of giant hii regions located in sfrs is seen .",
    "as known , the source of the background radiation in the radio band is electron gas and number density of electrons increases under the approach to the galactic center . mainly because of this reason , as the direction approaches to the galactic longitude l=0@xmath0 and the galactic latitude b=0@xmath0 , intensity of this radiation increases . naturally , the background radiation is most effective on the psrs with low flux values and on the snrs with low surface brightness ( @xmath4 ) values",
    ".    in the galaxy , there are hii region complexes ( which include several ob associations ) with large sizes and high surface brightness values .",
    "some of these complexes are located close to the sun and in the directions far away from the galactic center direction .",
    "such hii region complexes can have considerable contribution to the background radio radiation and they can change the smoothness of distribution of the background radiation at small angular sizes .",
    "this is clearly seen , for example , for the region where vela is located in ( 262@xmath0 @xmath10 l @xmath10 268@xmath0 ) .",
    "below , we will discuss the effect of the background radiation and the effects of different sfrs ( which include many o - type stars ) on the psr search at 1400 mhz and on the snr search at 1000 mhz .",
    "please note that the searches for psrs at 400 mhz have high sensitivity only in the arecibo window ( 40@xmath0 @xmath10 l @xmath10 65@xmath0 , @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath162.5@xmath0 , hulse & taylor 1974 , 1975 ) .",
    "it must also be noted that psrs have steep spectrum in general , so that , effect of the background radiation is not so important on radiation of psrs at 400 mhz .",
    "we have examined the effect of galactic background radiation on the observed snrs by considering the l and b values .",
    "snrs g3.8 + 0.3 and g354.8 - 0.8 are the dimmest among the snrs which are the closest to the galactic center direction ( in the range l=0@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 and @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath102@xmath0 ) .",
    "@xmath4 values of these 2 snrs are , respectively , 1.86@xmath810@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 and 1.17@xmath810@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 .",
    "the snrs g6.4 + 4.0 and g358.0 + 3.8 ( which have a bit larger @xmath18b@xmath18 values ) have @xmath4 values 2.04@xmath810@xmath9 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 and 1.56@xmath810@xmath9 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "it is possible to observe such low-@xmath4 snrs with @xmath18l@xmath18@xmath360@xmath070@xmath0 ( i.e. far away from the galactic center ) and even with @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath102@xmath0 . among the observed snrs only 2 of them ( g156.2 + 5.7 , which is not shown in figure 1 , and g182.4 + 4.3 ) have @xmath4 @xmath10 10@xmath9 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 ( green 2001 ) .",
    "so , the effect of the background radiation on the snr search in the galactic anticenter directions can surely be neglected for the snrs with @xmath4 @xmath19 3@xmath810@xmath9 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 ( see figures 1 and 2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only 21% of all the snrs given in green ( 2001 ) have @xmath4 @xmath10 10@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 . for the snrs in the anti - center directions ,",
    "even if the @xmath4 values are small , the flux values ( f@xmath14@xmath4@xmath8@xmath20@xmath21 , where @xmath20 is the angular diameter of the snr ) can be larger compared to the flux values of the snrs in the galactic central directions in most of the cases ( see figure 3 ) , because the snrs in the anticenter directions have , in general , smaller distances and larger sizes .    among the known psrs in the interval l=0@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 and @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath102@xmath0 , psr j1728 - 3733 ( l = 350@xmath0.8 , b = @xmath221@xmath0.66 ) has the lowest flux at 1400 mhz : f@xmath2 = 0.19 mjy .",
    "other low - flux psrs are psr j1804 - 2228 ( l = 7@xmath0.72 , b = @xmath220@xmath0.4 ) with f@xmath2 = 0.2 mjy and both psr 1736 - 3511 ( l = 353@xmath0.6 , b = @xmath221@xmath0.6 ) and psr j1751 - 2516 ( l = 3@xmath0.85 , b = 0@xmath0.69 ) with f@xmath2 = 0.22 mjy .",
    "so , the background radiation practically can not hide psrs in the surveys of the last @xmath1410 years if f@xmath2 @xmath3 0.2 mjy ( similar to the case of snrs with @xmath4@xmath310@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 ) ( figures 4,5 ) .",
    "it is necessary to note that the observations of psrs also depend on the pulse period , the dispersion measure and also the observational instruments .",
    "here it is easier and more reliable to make statistical investigations because most of the psrs were observed with the same telescope .",
    "below , we will examine the influence of the background radiation and the influence of nearby hii regions on psr and snr searches .",
    "we can assume that , the snr search in the galaxy has been made with roughly the same sensitivity , but not necessarily with the same precision , in all directions . in figure 3 ,",
    "flux values ( at 1000 mhz ) of the snrs ( green 2001 ) with respect to galactic longitude for the snrs with @xmath18b@xmath18 @xmath10 5@xmath0 are represented .",
    "as seen in this figure , the snrs were searched down to the same flux value in all directions , but , since snrs are extended objects , the snrs with larger angular sizes are more easily observed in the galactic anticenter directions .",
    "observing snrs depends significantly on their @xmath4 values as well as their fluxes .",
    "the distribution of the snrs in different longitude intervals with respect to @xmath4 show that the longitude interval which is the most affected by the background radiation is l=0@xmath0@xmath140@xmath0 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "how this effect decreases as the line of sight recedes from the galactic center direction is also clearly seen . as mentioned above , among the snrs with @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath105@xmath0 the lowest @xmath4 value belongs to snr g182.4 + 4.3 . as seen from figure 1 , in the galactic central directions , except l@xmath230@xmath140@xmath0 , almost all the snrs with @xmath4@xmath33@xmath810@xmath9 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 are observable .",
    "the background radiation is strong in the regions l @xmath23 10@xmath030@xmath0 and",
    "l @xmath23 330@xmath0340@xmath0 , and the number of the hii regions in these intervals is large ( physics of cosmos 1986 ; georgelin & georgelin 1976 ; paladini et al .",
    "since this is related to the number of massive stars being large in these intervals , this fact shows itself in figure 1 . in such regions",
    "the formation rates of snrs and psrs must be high .",
    "the result of this is not clearly seen in figures 13 , but it can be seen in figures 4 and 5 which show the distributions of the psr sample including young psrs . in these regions also , number of the snrs with high surface brightness values is large .    in the last 7 years ,",
    "the galactic plane ( especially the southern hemisphere ) and particularly the galactic central directions were observed at 1400 mhz and a large number of new psrs were found ( johnston et al . 1995 ; manchester et al .",

    "2002 ; morris et al .",
    "2002 ) . as a result of these searches , today",
    "the number of the known psrs with measured 1400 mhz flux is larger than the number of the known psrs with measured 400 mhz flux . because of this",
    ", we examine the psrs observed at 1400 mhz .    in figure 4 ,",
    "634 psrs with @xmath18b@xmath18 @xmath10 5@xmath0 are displayed .",
    "as seen from the flux distribution with respect to the galactic longitude , many psrs with small f@xmath2 values are located in galactic arms and in the galactic central directions . from the figure",
    "it is seen that , in the 280@xmath0 @xmath10 l @xmath10 340@xmath0 part of the region which was searched with the highest sensitivity ( f@xmath2 @xmath10 0.2 mjy ) more low - flux psrs were found . in the interval l",
    "= 0@xmath0@xmath120@xmath0 the number of psrs with f@xmath2 @xmath10 0.2 mjy is very small .",
    "the reason for this is not the search being not so sensitive and precise , but the background radiation being very strong . in figure 5 ,",
    "f@xmath2  l diagram of 496 psrs with @xmath18b@xmath18 @xmath10 2@xmath0 is displayed .",
    "when we compare figures 4 and 5 , we see a larger decrease in the number of the psrs located in the galactic central directions which have f@xmath2 @xmath10 0.2 mjy .    in figure 6 , @xmath18z@xmath18l diagram of the psrs with @xmath18l@xmath18@xmath1070@xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath18b@xmath18 @xmath10 2@xmath0 , dm @xmath10 800 pc/@xmath24 and f@xmath2 @xmath10 0.5 mjy is represented .",
    "since the electron density strongly depends on the longitude value , as the direction becomes far away from the galactic center direction , the psrs ( in such directions ) which have the same dm value that the psrs in the galactic center direction have , are located at larger distances .",
    "this leads to the possibility of the @xmath18z@xmath18 values to be larger for the same @xmath18b@xmath18 values .",
    "for the same dm value of two different psrs , the smaller distance value belongs to the one which is closer to the galactic center direction . as seen from figure 8 ,",
    "although the distances of the psrs in the interval l = 0@xmath0@xmath120@xmath0 are somewhat less , the average @xmath18z@xmath18 value is larger and this shows that the average @xmath18b@xmath18 value of these psrs is larger .",
    "this is also a result of the effect of the background radiation .    in order to have the probability of observing the psrs with roughly the same flux values and the snrs with roughly the same @xmath4 values to be almost the same for the whole galactic plane and in",
    "order not to reduce the number of the objects too much , we will first consider only the psrs with f@xmath2 @xmath19 0.2 mjy and the snrs with @xmath4 ( at 1 ghz ) @xmath19",
    "10@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7ster@xmath7 .",
    "the character of the background radiation ( see figure 1 ) does not show the possibility of the influence of each of the ob associations separately on observations of psrs and snrs . despite this fact , we have checked the possibility of influences of the ob associations given in the lists of garmany & stencel ( 1992 ) and melnik & efremov ( 1995 ) .",
    "we did not find any significant contribution of any one of the ob associations to the galactic background radiation .",
    "observational data of psrs ( atnf pulsar catalogue 2003 ; guseinov et al .",
    "2003a ) and snrs ( green 2001 ) show that even in the galactic central directions ( l=0@xmath0@xmath110@xmath0 , @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath102@xmath0 ) all the snrs with @xmath4@xmath310@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7sr@xmath7 and the psrs with f@xmath2@xmath30.2 mjy are observable .",
    "since the background radiation is strongly dependent on the galactic latitude , the snrs with @xmath4@xmath31.5@xmath810@xmath9 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7sr@xmath7 in the same longitude interval can be observed if @xmath18b@xmath18@xmath34@xmath0 .",

    "it is seen from psr - snr associations that the ages of the snrs which are genetically connected to psrs do not exceed 3@xmath810@xmath17 yr in general ( kaspi & helfand 2002 ) .",
    "since the snrs in the regions we examined have less surface brightness values on average , we can roughly say that the ages of these snrs may exceed 3@xmath810@xmath17 yr but not greater than 5@xmath810@xmath17 yr . there are 23 snrs with @xmath4@xmath310@xmath5 wm@xmath6hz@xmath7sr@xmath7 located at d@xmath163.2 kpc from the sun , among which 14 of them are in the sector under consideration .",

    "if we further assume that the radius of the galaxy is 12 kpc and the average number density of the snrs in the whole galaxy is the same as the number density of the snrs within 3 kpc around the sun , then the number of the snrs having ages less than 5@xmath810@xmath17 yr must be about 800 in the galaxy .",
    "( since the distribution of snrs in the galaxy is not homogeneous and the distribution of their number density with respect to galactic radius is not known well , we can not estimate number of the snrs considerably better ) . from this result ,",
    "the formation rate of snrs turns out to be about one in 65 yr which is approximately the same as the sn explosion rate ( van den bergh & tammann 1991 ; capellaro et al .",
