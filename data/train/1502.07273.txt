    "although , in principle , @xmath0+bse can be applied to any material , it is computationally too demanding for many systems of technological interest . quantum chemistry offers powerful tools , such as coupled clusters ( cc ) and configuration interaction singles and doubles ( cisd ) , @xcite to accurately compute optical properties of molecules .",
    "again , only small systems can be treated with these methods , due to their huge computational costs .",
    "since the turn of the century , time - dependent density - functional theory ( tddft ) has gained increasing popularity , @xcite due to its remarkable ability in reproducing optical spectra of small molecules and clusters , with relatively low computational effort .",

    "@xcite @xmath1 blue - shifts the absorption onset above the kohn - sham ( ks ) gap , and redistributes the oscillator strength ( os ) to higher energies , providing a good approximation for the optical spectra .",
    "@xcite however , tddft suffers from severe drawbacks when dealing with extended systems .",
    "the spurious long - range behavior of standard @xmath2 inhibits reproducing bound excitons in solids .",
    "@xcite for the same reason , tddft is unable to describe charge - transfer - like excitations in molecular complexes .",
    "@xcite to overcome these limitations , new kernels have been developed including many - body effects @xcite and exhibiting the correct long - range behavior .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , these improvements mainly concern specific classes of materials and/or excitations , and therefore do not often extend , in practice , the range of applicability of tddft .    the goal of this work is to understand the role of many - body effects in the optical excitations of molecular materials , from the gas - phase to crystals , and to clarify when and why tddft can be trusted .",
    "we adopt the adiabatic local - density approximation ( alda ) , @xcite as the simplest and most common kernel of tddft .",
    "while more sophisticated kernels can quantitatively improve the results , @xcite the physical picture is already clear from alda .",
    "@xcite we compare tddft with mbpt , with the aim to identify the most relevant contributions to the optical excitations and to understand to which extent tddft is able to reproduce them .",
    "to do so , we choose the family of oligothiophenes as prototypical example . since only a few intense peaks characterize their uv - visible spectra , @xcite they are ideally suited for this study .",

    "the imaginary part of the macroscopic dielectric function is related to the bse eigenvectors @xmath22 , which correspond to the amplitude of the excitons .",

    "our finding , indicating the lowest excitation energy of 2 t at 4.05  4.09 ev ( see table [ table1 ] ) , is in agreement with experiments , @xcite and with quantum - chemistry results , @xcite which evaluate the peak between 4.05 and 4.11 ev . as the size of the oligomer increases , discrepancies between the @xmath3+bse and alda spectra emerge in both the energy of the first peak and the overall spectral shape .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to better identify the cause of the disagreement between alda and mbpt results , we further analyze the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ( upper panel ) . compared to the @xmath25 spectrum ( turquoise shaded area ) ,",
    "the onset of _ triplet _ excitation energies ( green bars ) is red - shifted .",
    "we recall that in both cases the bse hamiltonian does not include the exchange term @xmath20 .",
    "hence , @xmath25 and _ triplet _ differ only by the treatment of the screened _ e - h _ interaction : in the former case , it is @xmath29-independent ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : h0 ] ) , while in the latter one the full dielectric tensor is included .",
    "@xcite remarkably , the character of lowest - energy excitations is the same ( table [ table3 ] ) . from this",
    "we conclude that , no matter how we treat the attractive _ e - h _",
    "term , the lowest - lying excitons keep their character . transferring this knowledge to the _ singlet _ spectrum ( blue line )",
    ", we emphasize that only the inclusion of the exchange term , @xmath20 , yields the correct description of the first two excitations .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous example of 6 t , where _",
    "e - h _ correlation plays the dominant role . in 1 t ,",
    "lfe are not only responsible for the redistribution of the os to higher energies , but also for the right order and composition of the lowest excitons .",
    "again , alda can not account for these many - body effects , inaccurately describing the first two peaks and slightly overestimating the absorption onset ( see @xmath30 and @xmath31 in table [ table1 ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ( bottom panel ) , the main effect of the alda kernel ( orange line ) , compared to the independent - particle approximation ( ipa , shaded gray area ) , is to blue - shift the energy of the first two peaks and to redistribute the os to higher energies .",
    "overall , the tddft results reflect the discrete spectrum of molecular levels .",
    "therefore , above the onset ( 7  10 ev ) , alda captures transitions between such localized single - particle states , in better agreement with bse than in the regime dominated by strongly bound excitons .",
    "when intermolecular interactions come into play , the shortcomings of tddft become even more dramatic . to extend our analysis in this direction",
    ", we go systematically to the 1 t crystalline phase , considered with two inequivalent molecules in an orthorhombic unit cell , of lattice vectors @xmath32=9.76  , @xmath33=7.2  , and @xmath34=6.67  .",
    "@xcite we investigate also a model system with lattice vectors scaled by a factor 1.25 with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 : we refer to this structure as _ expanded _ crystal .",
    "the corresponding spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( bottom and middle panels ) . due to the small size of the molecular constituents , large values of @xmath35 , and hence of @xmath36 and of @xmath37",
    ", are obtained from mbpt ( table [ table1 ] ) . a systematic decrease of these quantities , going from the isolated compound to its crystalline phases , indicates enhanced screening together with delocalization of the exciton wave - function , as also found for other molecular crystals and polymers .",
    "@xcite a number of intense bound excitons appear in the spectra of both crystal structures .",
    "these are signatures of the strong _ e - h _ interaction in organic crystals , also beyond the first few excitations .",
    "this is also confirmed by the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ( upper panel ) . by comparing",
    "_ triplet _ ( green bars ) and @xmath25 excitation energiess ( turquoise shaded area ) ,",
    "we observe a large difference between their absorption onsets , similarly to the case of the 1 t molecule .",
    "also lfe play an important role .",
    "the _ singlet _ spectrum ( blue line ) is blue - shifted by over 2 ev compared to the _ triplet _ onset and the os of the low - energy peaks is drastically reduced with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "given this complexity , it is not surprising that tddft presents serious problems in correctly yielding the spectra .",
    "alda slightly underestimates the absorption onset ( table [ table1 ] ) and gives only two peaks in the respective energy regime , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ( bottom panel ) .",
    "likewise , two intense peaks appear also in the ipa spectrum ( gray shaded area ) , @xmath38 1 ev below the alda onset ( orange line ) . in both spectra ,",
    "the continuum starts at about 8 ev , in a region where bse features bound excitonic peaks .",
    "this confirms once again that alda reproduces only  ipa - like \" excitations , and thus can not quantitatively capture the spectral features of molecular crystals .",
    "in summary , through a systematic analysis of the optical absorption features in oligothiophenes , we have clarified the role of @xmath18-@xmath19 exchange and correlation in describing optical excitations in molecular materials . for the crystal structures",
    ", tddft turns out to be an inadequate approach , being unable to reproduce bound excitons and drastically underestimating the continuum onset . in large oligomers ,",
    "as shown for the case of 6 t , correlation effects turn up in terms of _ e - h _ interaction , evidenced by mixed excitations .",
    "conversely , in the single thiophene ring , the low - energy excitations are driven by lfe .",
    "neither scenario is captured by tddft .",
    "alda results are in excellent agreement with bse merely in the case of 2 t , where the first intense peak stems from one vertical transition . from this",
    "we conclude that alda can be trusted for optical excitations in molecular systems barely when correlation effects do not play a predominant role .",
    "only high - level methodologies , such as mbpt , which explicitly take into account @xmath18-@xmath18 and @xmath18-@xmath19 interactions , can reproduce optical spectra of organic materials , from the gas phase to any of their crystalline structure on equal footing .",
