    "the gauge / gravity duality  @xcite can map a strongly coupled conformal field theory onto a weak gravity system , which hence provides us a new method to study the condensed matter physics involving the strong interaction , especially the high temperature superconductors .",

    "moreover , for a given @xmath3 , the critical value @xmath105 in the case of @xmath131 is larger than that for @xmath94 .",
    "the effect of @xmath108 and @xmath111 on the critical value @xmath105 can be understood from the effective mass of the vector field . from eq .",
    "( [ smcvpsixr ] ) , it is easy to see that both the increasing @xmath108 and the larger @xmath111 corresponding to the increasing @xmath86 improve the effective mass , and thus hinder the superconductor phase transition .    to backup the numerical results , we recalculate the critical value @xmath105 by the analytical sl method . as worked in the gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background , by defining a trial function @xmath112 as @xmath113 , we can construct the sl eigenvalue equation in term of @xmath190 from eq .",
    "( [ smcvpsiu ] ) @xmath191 with the boundary conditions @xmath115 and @xmath116 . according to eq .",
    "( [ integ ] ) , we find the critical value @xmath105 as a function of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath3 for @xmath94 and  @xmath107 .",
    "the values of @xmath105 with respect to @xmath3 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] in the form of black points , from which we clearly see that the analytical results agree with the numerical results .",
    "apart from the case of the lowest landau level , by using the shooting method , we also show the critical chemical potential @xmath183 with respect to the magnetic field @xmath192 in the case with the landau level @xmath193 in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] ( where we have considered @xmath134 , sign(@xmath61)@xmath62 , and @xmath140 ) ,    ) , where @xmath185.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    from which we see the increasing magnetic field will break the superconducting phase and tend to make the normal phase more stable , which is similar to the ordinary superconductor model  @xcite .",
    "what is more , fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] has nothing to do with the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath3 and the mass squared of the vector field @xmath86 , which is obvious due to the scaling unit @xmath187 .",
    "similar to the calculation in sec .",
    "ii , we also calculate the critical behavior induced by the applied magnetic field in the gauss - bonnet - ads soliton background coupled to the su(2 ) gauge field , with the ansatz of the gauge field same as eq .",
    "( [ su2ans ] ) . by using complicated calculations",
    ", we find the su(2 ) ym model is still a special case of the mcv model with the parameters chosen as @xmath194 , and @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , the results of the su(2 ) model are qualitatively the same as the case of the mcv model .",
    "so far , working with the probe approximation , we have studied the holographic @xmath0-wave superconductor phase transition in the gauss - bonnet gravity via numerical and analytical methods .",
    "concretely , we mainly studied the effects of the applied magnetic field on the mcv model in the five - dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black hole and soliton backgrounds , respectively .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follows .    in the five - dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads black hole , even without the charge density , the superconductor phase transition can still be induced by the applied magnetic field .",
    "essentially , it is the nonminimal coupling term between the vector field @xmath21 and the u(1 ) gauge field that triggers the vector condensate . in the case of the lowest landau level @xmath196",
    ", the increasing magnetic field enhances the emergence of the vector  hair \" , which is rather similar to the qcd vacuum instability induced by the strong magnetic field  @xcite , while the stronger magnetic field makes the system more difficult to develop the vector condensate for the excited landau level , which is reminiscent of the ordinary superconductor  @xcite .",
    "all these appearances perhaps result from the diamagnetic and pauli pair breaking effect of the magnetic field .",
    "moreover , with the increase of the gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath3 , the critical temperature always decreases regardless of the charge density and whether the system is at the lowest landau level , which implies that the increasing @xmath3 always inhibits the superconductor phase transition .",
    "in addition , we find the analytical results are in agreement with the numerical results , and the mcv field model is always a generalization of the su(2 ) ym model with the general mass squared @xmath86 , the charge @xmath20 and the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath22 .",
    "the results in the five - dimensional gauss - bonnet - ads soliton are similar to the case in the gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background , while the difference is that , in the ads soliton , we obtained the curve for the critical chemical potential @xmath197 as a function of the external magnetic field @xmath198 for the lowest landau level , which is independent of @xmath3 and @xmath86 due to the fact that the scaling unit @xmath187 is calculated by @xmath199 .    in a word",
    ", the results showed that the magnetic field enhances the holographic @xmath0-wave superconductor phase transition with the lowest landau level , which is similar to the qcd vacuum instability , and the increasing gauss - bonnet parameter @xmath3 always makes the vector condensate more difficult .",
    "moreover , it is universal that the mcv model is a generalization of the su(2 ) ym model .",
    "furthermore , related studies such as refs .",
    "@xcite suggested that the magnetic field can indeed trigger the superconductor phase transition .",
    "therefore , our results shed light on understanding the strong interacting system from the perspective of the gravity / gauge duality to some extent .",
    "it is worth stressing that we study the mcv model and the su(2 ) model at the probe approximation . to further understand the process of the holographic superconductor phase transition",
    ", it is our task in the near future to study the backreaction of this mcv model without the external magnetic field in the gauss - bonnet - ads gravity and then to find the boundaries of the phase diagram in the parameter spacetime .",
