    "quantum mechanics and chaos theory are two great discoveries of the @xmath1 century .",
    "combining them leads to highly interesting and important questions ; for example , how does the uncertainty principle s inherent ` blurriness ' affect the sensitivity to initial conditions characteristic of chaotic systems ?",
    "quantum chaos rose to popular attention in the 1970s , first in the context of electron dynamics in atoms  @xcite , and subsequently for model two - dimensional ( 2d ) dynamical systems known as ` billiards '  @xcite . from a classical perspective",
    ", a billiard contains a particle traveling in straight lines between specular reflections at a shaped boundary wall . a variety of billiard shapes",
    "have been studied ranging from simple geometries ( e.g. , circle or square ) to more complex geometries ( e.g. , stadia and ` lemon ' billiards  @xcite ) and geometries with multiple topologically - independent walls ( e.g. , the sinai billiard  @xcite ) .",
    "billiards have since become an archetypal system for studies of quantum chaos  @xcite .",
    "the quest for experimental realizations of quantum billiards naturally followed , with microwave billiards formed in open resonators  @xcite and superconducting slabs  @xcite leading the way , closely followed by semiconductor microstructures  @xcite . in the years that followed , quantum billiards",
    "have also been realized in quantum ` corrals ' defined by scanning tunneling microscopy on metal surfaces  @xcite , in acoustic systems  @xcite , atom - optics systems  @xcite , and various optical systems including micro - cavity lasers  @xcite and double - clad optical fibers  @xcite .",
    "an important consideration in comparing measurements to theoretical expectations is to adequately account for practical aspects of the experimental implementation that affect the correspondence . for semiconductor billiards ,",
    "two important aspects are the electrostatic nature of confinement and impurities in the semiconductor  @xcite .",
    "these aspects , impurity scattering in particular , were considered in initial studies  @xcite and suggested to not obscure the essential physics .",
    "this has resulted in a widely - held perception that semiconductor microstructures are an ideal test - bed for dynamical quantum chaos ; for example , _  ... it is important to understand the consequences of non - diffusive electron dynamics on the electronic conductance or other transport properties .",
    "this question has been studied in much detail for semiconductor nanostructures in which the motion of electrons is ballistic rather than diffusive . in such systems ,",
    "disorder is negligible , and , consequently , all transport properties are determined by the shape of the sample , as in a billiard model . \" _",
    "however , a range of experiments following these initial studies have gradually shown that impurity scattering not only can not be ignored , but may actually dominate over boundary - dependent ` ballistic ' transport in semiconductor billiards .    here , we provide a short , focussed review of studies of electron transport in semiconductor microstructures , and offer evidence that these devices are not the ideal embodiment of quantum dynamical billiards , as is often thought based on the pioneering papers on this topic  @xcite . our aim is to show that the true picture of transport in these devices is much more complex than initially anticipated .",
    "the underpinning structure for most studies of semiconductor quantum dots and billiards is the modulation - doped algaas / gaas heterostructure  @xcite .",
    "it typically consists of a gaas substrate supporting an undoped algaas spacer layer , a si - doped algaas modulation - doping layer , and an undoped gaas cap layer ( fig .",

    "the narrow , triangular potential well at the algaas / gaas interface forms self - consistently through the band - bending induced by ionization of the si dopants ( fig .",
    "the well width is comparable to the electron fermi wavelength ( @xmath2  nm ) , strongly confining the electrons in the growth direction to form a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "further confinement of the 2deg is typically achieved using a set of metal surface electrodes ( gates ) defined using electron beam lithography techniques  @xcite ( fig .",
    "application of a negative bias @xmath3 to the gates electrostatically depletes the 2deg directly underneath , transferring the gate pattern into the 2deg as shown in fig .",
    "the result is a quasi - zero - dimensional quantum dot connected by small one - dimensional ( 1d ) entrance and exit ports to 2deg source and drain reservoirs .",

    "the two electron beams interfere when recombined , giving a transmitted beam intensity that is an oscillatory function of the flux @xmath27 enclosed by the loop ( and in this case , restricted entirely to the solenoid s interior ) .",

    "the aharonov - bohm effect lays at the heart of a range of magnetic field induced fluctuations in the electrical conductance of mesoscopic devices . at its simplest , it produces a sinusoidal fluctuation with a period @xmath30 in the conductance @xmath28 of nanoscale ring structures enclosing an area @xmath31 ; observed in both gold rings  @xcite and etched ring - shaped structures in an algaas / gaas heterostructure  @xcite .",
    "these experiments are performed at a temperature @xmath32  k using a @xmath33he cryostat or a @xmath33he/@xmath34he dilution refrigerator to ensure electron phase coherence .",

    "a classic example is the @xmath35 m square quantum dot in fig .",
    "3(a ) , which is connected to 2deg source and drain reservoirs via a pair of quantum point contact ( qpc ) entrance and exit ports .",
    "the qpc strongly diffracts the incoming electron wave  @xcite , allowing a range of trajectories linking the entrance and exit qpcs to interfere and contribute to @xmath28 . in a semiclassical picture ,",
    "each trajectory pair encloses a different area @xmath36 , giving a slightly different period of ab oscillation ; these combine to yield reproducible multi - spectral magnetoconductance @xmath37 fluctuations ( fig .",
    "these fluctuations are not noise ; as the lower trace in fig .",
    "3(b ) demonstrates , identical fluctuations are obtained if a device returned to a given gate bias configuration after measurements at other biases , providing the temperature remains low throughout ( see @xmath22 ) .",
    "the link between the spectral content of the magnetoconductance fluctuations ( mcf ) and the distribution of loop areas @xmath38  @xcite provides a ` magnetofingerprint ' of the electron trajectories within the dot  @xcite . while the underlying mechanism for these fluctuations is the same as that driving the well - known universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf )  @xcite , the amplitude of the fluctuations for dots is not universal  @xcite ; this is due to the lack of ensemble averaging that occurs in diffusive systems  @xcite .",
    "another commonly held difference between ucf in metals or mosfets and mcf in quantum dots is that whereas in the former transport is diffusive , in the latter the transport is assumed to be ballistic and hence determined by the geometry of the dot walls .",
    "we will return to examine this assumption in @xmath22 in light of recent experiments  @xcite that question the way we think about semiconductor billiards as systems for studying quantum chaos .",
    "the use of ballistic microstructures for studies of quantum chaos  @xcite evolved from experimental studies of ballistic junction devices  @xcite in the late 1980s .",
    "in particular , a seminal theoretical paper by jalabert _",
    "@xcite proposed that knowledge of the chaotic classical scattering dynamics could be used to predict quantitatively measurable properties of ballistic microstructures .",
    "this relies on a universal property of chaotic dynamics in open scattering systems whereby a particle s probability of escape is exponential in time  @xcite , giving measurable correlations in the energy / frequency spectrum  @xcite .",
    "et al _ extended this property to ballistic microstructures , translating the escape time distribution into a distribution of accumulated trajectory areas , which , using semiclassical arguments , produces mcf with particular statistical properties via the ab effect .",

    "@xcite were heavily averaged ( @xmath52 fast fourier transform ( fft ) spectra from half - overlapping @xmath53-point ( @xmath54  mt ) wide windows ) .",
    "single fft spectra for @xmath55 point blocks spanning @xmath56  mt revealed structure at low frequencies , consistent with structure in the large @xmath57 tails of the @xmath58 versus @xmath57 data presented in ref .",
    "such low frequency spectral peaks are an expected signature of wavefunction scarring by periodic orbits  @xcite , and have been extensively studied in subsequent calculations  @xcite , transport studies  @xcite and scanning - gate microscopy ( sgm ) studies  @xcite .",
    "however , of particular note for the discussion in @xmath22 is a comparison between the power spectra for nominally identical geometries ( i.e. , the stadium on device 1 with the stadium on device 2 or the circle on device 1 with the circle on device 2 ) in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "if the dominant factor in determining the trajectory distribution is device geometry , then the spectra for identical geometries on different chips should match , or at least be very similar ; they instead differ significantly , indicating that dot shape alone can not account for the electron dynamics .    subsequent theoretical work by baranger _",
    "et al _  @xcite proposed the alternative possibility of distinguishing between geometries supporting chaotic and regular ( i.e. , non - chaotic ) dynamics using the ` ballistic ' analog  @xcite of another important interference effect in diffusive 2d systems known as weak localization ( wl )  @xcite .",
    "weak localization involves interference between a trajectory that returns to its point of origin via a set of impurity scattering events , and its time - reversed counterpart .",
    "application of an increasing perpendicular magnetic field @xmath23 progressively breaks time - reversal symmetry for shorter length paths , leading to a positive magnetoconductivity correction ( minima in @xmath37 at @xmath59 ) , and hence a peak in the magnetoresistance .   in quantum dots have also been subsequently proposed  @xcite . ]",
    "the proposal by baranger _",

    "it is important that the average above is taken over an infinite window in @xmath64 to ensure that the contributions to eq .",
    "3/4 only include the interference of paths that are precise time - reversed pairs .",
    "this averaging has important experimental implications ",
    "the geometry effect should not be directly observable in a single magnetoresistance @xmath65 trace , but only when sufficient averaging is applied to eliminate the conductance fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is reported in ref .",

    "this is borne out experimentally ; e.g. , in studies of dots featuring an additional ` shape - distorting ' gate by chan _",

    "it is very important to note that these studies were not performed in single dots , but in devices consisting of 48 dots with nominally - identical geometry arranged in a @xmath69 array .",
    "this is vital in terms of the averaging issues discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but may also have important implications in terms of small - angle scattering , as we will discuss in @xmath70 .",
    "this brings us to an important turning point in terms of our understanding of ballistic transport and quantum chaos in semiconductor billiards and quantum dots .",
    "on the basis of the work discussed above it is tantalizing and easy to assume a great simplicity in these devices : images of electrons traveling along straight line trajectories between specular reflections from walls with well defined geometrical shapes , clear divisions of geometries into chaotic and non - chaotic , which in turn give clear and distinct experimental signatures , etc .",
    "see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . as the following discussion will show , in reality , the picture of electron dynamics in semiconductor billiards is more complex .",
    "the practicalities involved in the experimental realizations have effects that are far from negligible , and that will ultimately force us to rethink our understanding of the results previously described in this section .",
    "the complexities involved in the theoretical calculations described above typically forced semiconductor billiards to be stripped down to their most basic elements for modeling ( particularly in the early 90s , where computational capabilities were not what they are today ) .",
    "the early models of dynamics in semiconductor microstructures assumed hard - walls ( i.e. , the location of the wall in terms of particle reflection is independent of energy ) and geometries where the phase space is either completely chaotic ( ergodic ) or completely regular .",
    "however , semiconductor billiards are defined by electrostatic depletion of selected regions of the 2deg , using either negatively biased surface - gates or by locally etching away the dopants .",
    "this naturally results in a soft - wall potential  @xcite , often best approximated as parabolic  @xcite .",
    "this profile results generically in a mixed phase - space , containing both chaotic and regular regions ; the ramifications of this were explored by ketzmerick  @xcite .",
    "trapping by the infinite hierarchy of cantori at the boundaries between regular and chaotic regions in the phase space causes the escape time probability distribution to take a power - law form @xmath71 with exponent @xmath72 .",

    "this ` universality ' bears a strong resemblance to that of universal conductance fluctuations ( ucf ) in mesoscopic metal films and mosfets ( see , for example , fig .  3 of skocpol  @xcite ) where the transport is diffusive rather than ballistic .",
    "this raises interesting and radical questions : even though @xmath106 for billiards and they are ballistic by traditional measures  @xcite , is the transport really ballistic ? or is it diffusive , such that a form of scattering essentially undetected by the mobility , dominates the transport ?",

    "these positively charged ionized dopants interact electrostatically with the electrons in the 2deg causing significant scattering .",
    "high mobility 2degs are obtained through a process known as ` modulation doping '  @xcite , where the si dopants are separated from the 2deg by a @xmath107  nm undoped algaas spacer layer .",
    "the key to modulation doping is that ionized dopants are converted from large - angle scattering sites to small - angle scattering sites by increases in the dopant-2deg separation .",
    "this effectively ` hides ' some of the ionized dopant scattering because the mobility is weighted towards large - angle scattering  @xcite ( see @xmath70 ) .",

    "@xcite gives a remarkable visual demonstration of the impact that small - angle scattering has on even quite short and simple ballistic transport paths between qpcs .",
    "although small - angle scattering clearly does nt prevent ballistic focussing from being observed electrically  @xcite , it certainly forces one to question whether the concept of semiconductor billiards with long straight - line trajectories bouncing specularly off the billiard walls ( see e.g. , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite or fig .",
    "1/6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) is a realistic picture ? it also raises the question of the extent to which small - angle scattering governs the dynamics and resulting electrical properties of these devices .",
    "scannell _ et al _",
    "@xcite and see _ et al _",
    "@xcite have recently performed experiments aimed at illuminating the relative importance of disorder and boundary scattering in semiconductor billiards .",
    "these experiments rely on an important feature of the dopant physics of algaas / gaas heterostructures and the newly developed capability to make billiards where the 2deg is populated electrostatically using a gate enabling the dopants to be removed  @xcite and the effect of small - angle dopant scattering on transport to be clearly observed .",
    "si dopants in modulation - doped al@xmath136ga@xmath137as / gaas heterostructures with @xmath138 can take one of two possible configurations  @xcite .",
    "the first is as a shallow hydrogenic donor with a positive or neutral charge ( @xmath139/@xmath140 ) sitting at a substitutional site .",
    "the second , known as a dx center , involves a lattice distortion that pulls the si donor into an interstitial position along the @xmath141 direction , producing a deep trap . at temperatures below @xmath142  k ,",
    "the dx centers normally bind two electrons and have a negative charge ( dx@xmath143 ) , but can be excited thermally or optically to detrap into dx@xmath144 and dx@xmath118 states .",
    "as described earlier , the ionized dopants impose a ` disorder potential ' on the 2deg  @xcite , with a density of scattering sites @xmath145dx@xmath146dx@xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the density of a particular dopant configuration .",
    "while @xmath149 is normally fixed for a given heterostructure and gate - voltage configuration during cooldown  @xcite , the allocation of particular si site as @xmath150 or dx varies varies each cooldown .",
    "thus the resulting disorder potential is fixed for a single cooldown , leading to the repeatability of @xmath37 traces shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) and ref .  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the disorder potential should change markedly on separate cooldowns , and this would produce one of two results . if the transport in the billiard is truly ballistic , such that the disorder is negligible and the electron trajectories are determined only by scattering from the boundaries , then @xmath37 should remain the same in subsequent cooldowns ( providing @xmath151  k in between ) . alternatively ,",
    "if the disorder potential does affect transport , then we should see some level of change in @xmath37 , as predicted by feng , lee and stone  @xcite .    figure  5(a ) shows @xmath37 traces obtained on separate cooldowns of the modulation - doped device inset to fig .",
    "there is clearly a striking difference between the traces indicative of the disorder potential affecting the transport .",
    "the gate voltage was adjusted slightly on the second cooldown in order to match @xmath121 and obtain similar injection conditions  @xcite , but see _ et al _ observe the same behaviour if @xmath3 is kept the same , or takes other values as part of an extensive search for matching @xmath37 traces  @xcite . as fig .",
    "5(b ) shows , the change in disorder potential upon thermal cycling also alters the gate characteristics ; the fluctuations there also originate from quantum interference  @xcite .",
    "this thermally - induced irreproducibility is also evident in a parallel study by scannell _",
    "@xcite , where the device is cooled to @xmath152  mk and @xmath37 is measured , the temperature is raised to an intermediate temperature @xmath153 for 30 minutes and returned to @xmath152  mk , @xmath37 is measured again , the temperature is raised to @xmath154 , re - cooled and measured again , and so on until @xmath155  k. the various post - cycling @xmath37 traces are compared to the first cooldown @xmath37 trace using a cross - correlation analysis  @xcite , with a precipitous drop in the correlation coefficient @xmath156 from @xmath157 to @xmath128 obtained at @xmath158  k for algaas / gaas and gainas / inp billiards and gaas quantum wires .",
    "this temperature dependence points strongly to ionized dopant scattering playing a major role in influencing transport in these devices .",
    "the ` acid test ' for the hypothesis that the disorder potential dominates transport is to remove the dopants entirely .",
    "this requires a complete redesign of the device ; a metallic gate needs to be added and this needs to overlap the contacts to the 2deg to ensure electrical continuity .",
    "this is achieved using a degenerately - doped gaas cap layer as the gate , which enables self - alignment of the gate to the contacts  @xcite .",
    "the n@xmath118-gaas cap is divided into three gates by shallow wet etching as shown inset to fig .",
    "5(d ) ; the central gate ( green ) is biased positively to @xmath117 to electrostatically populate the 2deg , the side - gates ( red ) can be used to tune the device further , but remain grounded here . figure  5(c ) shows @xmath37 before and after thermal cycling to @xmath152  k for three different @xmath117 , in each case the mcf are reproducible with high fidelity . as fig .",
    "5(d ) shows , the gate characteristics are also highly reproducible .",
    "given the mcf s role as a ` magnetofingerprint '  @xcite of electron transport within the dot , fig .",
    "5 demonstrates that the disorder potential has a significant , perhaps even dominant , influence on the electron dynamics .",
    "we now discuss an explanation for how and why this occurs , the implications regarding past results , and some thoughts on follow - up experiments to further elucidate the role that disorder plays in billiards .",
    "historically , a major focus in mesoscopic physics has been to improve the mobility to access new physical regimes that are otherwise obscured by disorder .",
    "this was a key driver for work on the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite and ballistic transport devices ( e.g. , quantum wires , dots and billiards . ) as per figs .",
    "2(a - c ) .",
    "it is vital to note that the mobility , and by association @xmath11 , are only part of the picture .",
    "the mobility is a measure of momentum decay and it contains a weighting term @xmath159cos@xmath160  @xcite , where @xmath36 is the scattering angle , that makes it preferentially sensitive to large - angle scattering events  @xcite figures  2(d / e ) present a more refined picture for the diffusive and ballistic regimes ; here large - angle scattering sites are black and small - angle scattering sites are grey ( darker shades represent a propensity towards larger scattering angles ) .",
    "the two pictures of diffusive transport ( a / d ) are essentially the same , and in either case , it is impurity scattering that dominates over boundary scattering .",
    "the two pictures for ballistic transport ( b / e ) are very different ; as in @xmath22 the ionized dopants present as small - angle scatterers with a scattering length set by the spacer thickness  @xcite , which is much smaller than @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath11 .",
    "these deflect the electron trajectories between the walls as shown , suggesting a more complex picture with a less clear - cut distinction between the traditional diffusive and ballistic regimes .",
    "bearing in mind the thermal redistribution in dopant potential  @xcite , this explains why the mcf changes so much between cool - downs and differs when studying the same geometry on two separate chips ( see fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from this perspective",
    ", the mcf in modulation - doped billiards is probably best viewed as analogous to ucf in metal films and narrow mosfets  @xcite . in both cases the transport is dominated by disorder scattering , the fluctuations are reproducible in a single sample / disorder configuration but vary between samples and disorder configurations , are quenched by an increase in temperature , and have certain universal statistical properties independent of the sample shape and precise dopant configuration  @xcite  for the ucf this is the amplitude @xmath161 which depends on the ratio of length @xmath12 to coherence length @xmath162  @xcite , whilst for mcf in billiards , this appears to be the fractal dimension @xmath80 which depends on a more complex combination of area @xmath31 and quantum lifetime @xmath92 , at fixed temperature  @xcite .",
    "the billiard walls should help rather than hinder this analogy ; their action is to repeatedly feed the electron back into the diffusive environment inside the billiard  @xcite . in a sense ,",
    "the walls impose reflective periodic boundary conditions , effectively converting the billiard into a larger area , diffusive 2d system .",
    "the natural correlations between these mirrored sub - units , combined with the two qpcs acting as points of focus for the interference contribution may explain the loss of amplitude universality , and its replacement by the more complex universality in fig .",
    "4(b )  @xcite . modeling a small - area , small - angle diffusive system with reflective boundary conditions on the edge for all but two points where trajectories can enter / exit and",
    "contribute to @xmath37 , and comparing with traditional ucf  @xcite may give interesting insights .",
    "alternatively , it may be interesting to consider existing ucf models , but with the uniform random disorder replaced by repeating small ` tiles ' of a common disorder configuration .    nonetheless , `",
    "ballistic ' transport , where the walls rather than disorder is the shaping force for a given trajectory , can not be neglected entirely in billiards .",
    "comparing figs .  2(b , c , e ) it is clear that the diffusive effect of small - angle scattering should increase with trajectory length . as a result ,",
    "the long trajectories crucial to discriminating between chaotic and regular geometries in semiclassical theories  @xcite are likely destroyed by disorder such that all billiards are essentially chaotic , irrespective of geometry , from the perspective of the tails in the trajectory area distributions @xmath38 .",
    "as such , the disorder has the same ` chaos - inducing ' effect as a sinai diffuser  @xcite , but with a scale and quantity more similar to antidot arrays  @xcite where chaotic transport , weak localization and quantum interference fluctuations are also observed . shorter trajectories",
    "may well survive , and we see two separate categories of these .",
    "the first are skipping orbits as highlighted by christensson _",
    "@xcite , and used for studying phase - breaking in dots by bird _ et al _  @xcite .",
    "these are likely protected from disorder scattering by the short distance between bounces combined with a field - induced curvature mechanism similar to that involved in the quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "the feasibility of the survival of skipping orbits amidst the disorder potential is evident in the sgm studies by aidala _",
    "the survival of short ballistic trajectories may also explain measurements of the symmetry of mcf in the non - linear voltage regime as a function of the symmetry of billiard shape  @xcite .",
    "combined , the work above provides strong evidence that billiard shape is still exerts an influence on the mcf .",
    "the second category is periodic orbits , the classic example being the diamond scar in square dots  @xcite ; this also clearly survives small - angle scattering as observed in sgm studies by burke _",
    "@xcite , but scars with other shapes have also been reported very recently  @xcite .",
    "it is easy to consider this as a straightforward case of wavefunction scarring  @xcite , but there may be more to it . the diffusive effect of disorder should not only affect the unstable periodic orbit underlying the wavefunction scar , but it will do so differently between devices , between different cooldowns of the same device , and possibly also as parameters such as the gate voltage are changed .",
    "the latter may partially explain the observation of some but not all of the expected scar states in previous experiments on modulation - doped dots  @xcite .",
    "wavefunction scarring in dots has recently been linked to a theory known as ` quantum darwinism '  @xcite , where preferred states within the dot survive coupling with the environment , which acts as the ` selection pressure ' in the theory  @xcite . from an experimental perspective  @xcite",
    ", it may be that disorder presents an additional selection pressure , acting in partnership with environmental coupling , that eliminates scar states connected to much more complex underlying periodic orbits . from this perspective",
    ", it would be interesting to extend recent sgm studies of dots  @xcite to undoped heterostructure system to see if a greater variety of scars are observed .",
    "it would also be interesting to perform sgm studies of undoped 2degs and ballistic focussing structures more generally to establish the level of improvement provided by eliminating the ionized dopants .",
    "the current architecture , with a gate above the 2deg , is unsuitable for sgm ; an alternative would be to use an inverted structure  @xcite , possibly using deep etching instead of surface gates and/or patterning of the doped gate layer using focussed ion - beam lithography , as in the bilayer billiard  @xcite .",
    "we conclude by attempting to ` close the loop ' and reconsider ballistic microstructures as devices for studying dynamical chaos in the quantum limit . the data in fig .",
    "5(c / d ) shows that removal of the modulation doping instils thermal robustness in the mcf obtained from the device .",
    "correspondingly , one would expect a significant reduction in small - angle scattering , despite this , substantial disorder will remain .",
    "this includes background impurities , some ionizable , some not , as well as interface roughness , defects in the walls of the device , etc .",
    "we suspect that this remnant disorder will prevent perfectly identical @xmath37 from being obtained in separate undoped devices with nominally identical geometry , obviating the truly ballistic quantum dots envisioned theoretically  @xcite .",
    "one path forward might be the approach used by chang _",
    "@xcite , where a @xmath69 array of nominally identical dots was studied to average out the mcf .",
    "this averaging of the mcf essentially constitutes an averaging of the dot disorder potentials to expose the effect of the common lithographic geometry .",
    "attempting this using arrays of undoped dots in clean heterostructures with low background impurity densities may bring these devices close to a true ` ballistic ' limit in terms of semiclassical dynamics , providing of course that the lithography defining their walls can be made sufficiently identical .",
    "this would be a useful challenge for future work .",
    "ultimately , while single quantum dots are not sufficiently ` ballistic ' for use in studies of quantum chaos in our opinion , they have been shown to be sufficiently ballistic for potential applications  @xcite as ballistic rectifiers  @xcite and y - branch switches  @xcite .",
    "the reduced small - angle scattering in undoped quantum dots offers much potential in this regard , their thermal robustness suggests they may also offer a path to devices with significantly reduced charge noise , which is a well known effect of fluctuations in the charge state of ionized dopants  @xcite .",
