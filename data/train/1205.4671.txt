    "after several decades of neutrino experiments , a clear quantitative picture of the neutrino oscillation parameters is gradually emerging ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . the super - kamiokande collaboration established that the atmospheric neutrino mass squared splitting is @xmath11 and that the corresponding mixing angle is large , possibly maximal @xmath12  @xcite . the data from sno , super - kamiokande and kamland experiments @xcite allowed to established the large mixing angle solution as a unique solution of the long standing solar neutrino problem , with a solar neutrino mass squared splitting @xmath13 and mixing angle @xmath14 .",
    "a series of subsequent experiments , using reactor and accelerator neutrinos , have pinned down the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation parameters with a few to several percent accuracy , as summarized in table [ tab : tabdata-1106 ] .    furthermore , in june of 2011 the t2k collaboration reported @xcite evidence at @xmath15 for a non - zero value of the angle @xmath3 .",
    "subsequently the minos @xcite and double chooz @xcite collaborations also reported evidence for @xmath16 , although with a smaller statistical significance .",

    "subsequently , the reno experiment reported a @xmath25 evidence for a non - zero value of @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath26 the value of @xmath3 determined in the reno experiment is compatible with that measured in the daya bay experiment .",
    "it is interesting to note also that the mean value of @xmath27 found in the global analysis of the neutrino oscillation data in @xcite differs very little from the mean values found in the daya bay and reno experiments .",
    "the results on @xmath3 described above will have far reaching implications for the program of research in neutrino physics .",
    "a relatively large value of @xmath28 opens up the possibilities , in particular , i ) for searching for cp violation effects in neutrino oscillations experiments with high intensity accelerator neutrino beams ( like t2k , no@xmath29a , etc . ) ; ii ) for determining the sign of @xmath30 , and thus the type of neutrino mass spectrum , which can be with normal or inverted ordering ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , in the long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments at accelerators ( no@xmath29a , etc . ) , in the experiments studying the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as in experiments with reactor antineutrinos @xcite .",
