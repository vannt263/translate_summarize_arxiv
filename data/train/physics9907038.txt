    "evolving from the initial experiments@xcite , the study of atom focusing using standing wave ( sw ) light fields has developed into a broad area of research in atom optics .",
    "a standing wave field acts as a lens as a result of a spatially - dependent light shift , focusing atoms into a periodic set of lines or dots having widths of the order of tens of nanometers and distanced from one another by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wave length of the light . focusing by thick lenses and atomic deposition on a substrate",
    "have been observed for beams of na@xcite , metastable he @xcite , and cr@xcite .",
    "the latest achievements in this area are summarized in a recent review article@xcite .",
    "perhaps even more significantly , lithographic techniques have been developed to create nanosurfaces in semiconductors and metals using metastable atoms as a pattern template for selective etching@xcite .",
    "similarly , cold , trapped atoms can be subjected to sw light pulses@xcite , creating a periodic wave packet which will focus along the field propagation direction at specific times following the atom - field interaction .",
    "previous experiments with atomic beams have been carried out in a thick lens regime for which the atoms focus within the laser beam .",
    "since the substrate surface is typically placed near the plane of peak intensity of the thick sw lens and mechanically fixed to the retroreflecting mirror , in some sense these experiments are easier to set up when compared to thin lens experiments .",
    "the classical and quantum motion through a thick lens have been numerically simulated and compared to experimental data in refs.@xcite .",
    "the classical motion and lens parameters after thick and thin lenses have also been studied in detail within a ray optics formalism@xcite . for that work",
    "the lens characteristics and aberrations beyond the parabolic lens approximation were simulated numerically as were the effects of different atomic velocity distributions .",
    "however , a comprehensive theoretical study of the thin sw lens from a quantum perspective that details corrections to the lens parameters as a result of spherical aberration , chromatic aberration , and angular beam divergence has not appeared previously .",
    "in this article we stress the flexibility and validity of a thin lens approach , where the atoms are detected or used for lithography after the interaction with the field .",
    "we derive exact and computationally expedient results for atomic matter waves by quantizing the center - of - mass motion from the outset , a process that naturally accounts for spherical aberration .",
    "our hope is to stimulate interest in thin lens experiments by introducing a straightforward , yet rigorous theoretical framework for the problem and by deriving analytical results for lens parameters to facilitate lithographic and atom optical configurations .",
    "the thin sw lens creates high contrast periodic structures in free flight and opens up numerous possibilities for fourier atom optics to image and manipulate modulated matter waves .",
    "this approach is highly desirable , especially when coupled with advances in bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) atom laser sources@xcite with large fluxes and narrow velocity distributions . to our knowledge",
    "similar studies have been carried out only numerically using a fresnel diffraction theory in the coordinate representation for a ",
    "doughnut-mode optical field@xcite , standing wave field@xcite , and conical lens@xcite .    rather than using the diffraction theory simply for numerical propagation of the matter waves , we extend its usefulness by deriving approximate analytical expressions for the sw field lens parameters .",
    "the fresnel - kirchhoff integral , incorporating the lowest - order spherical aberration , gives a relatively simple form for the atomic wave function near the focal plane and sw intensity extrema .",
    "asymptotically for large atom - field pulse areas , this integral leads to a universal atomic density profile , revealing the behavior of the focal distance , peak atomic density , focal spot size [ half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the atom density at the focus ] , depth of focus , and background density as a function of the pulse area .",
    "the analytical asymptotic results can then be compared to either numerical asymptotic approximations of the fresnel integral or to the exact atomic distributions and lens parameters , most easily evaluated using a fourier approach .",
    "the time evolution of a free particle s wave function , when subject to a spatially periodic initial condition such as that imposed on an atom beam after passing through a sw field or microfabricated grating@xcite , can be expressed in terms of a fourier expansion in the ( plane wave ) spatial harmonics of the modulation period . as such , the results we derive are closely related to the canon of research on periodic light optics@xcite . in the thin lens approximation the fourier components can be calculated exactly for the wave function and density and then superposed to evaluate the atomic spatial distribution : for this approach the calculations effectively take place in a momentum representation , whereas a numerical integration over the free particle propagator gives results in a coordinate representation .",
    "the expressions for the density s fourier components that we use below were obtained recently for far - detuned @xcite and resonant@xcite sw fields . to our knowledge",
    "this exact solution has not been used previously to examine periodic focusing parameters , nor to compare with approximate solutions of focused waves .",
    "however , the fourier components and the degradation of this type of focusing have been proposed recently as a way to study the onset of many - body effects in condensates@xcite .",
    "the fourier approach has several advantages .",
    "first , the time dependence of the fourier coefficients directly reveals the quantum nature of the periodic atomic density as it varies explicitly with the atomic recoil energy of integer pairs of photons .",
    "second , summation of the fourier series leads to fast convergence of the fresnel solutions to arbitrary accuracy for all times when compared to the numerical integration of the full fresnel - kirchhoff integral . with this fourier method for example",
    ", we can reproduce the main fresnel diffraction results of ref.@xcite without having to integrate the partial differential equation or equivalent integral equation on a lattice . furthermore",
    ", the fourier method can be employed for the general case of typical atomic beam experiments , where the incident beam or trapped atoms are most accurately specified by a density matrix in momentum space , such as a thermal velocity distribution .",
    "the implications are that the spatial extent of the atomic distribution is much larger than the wavelength of the standing wave and the wave function is not transform limited ( except perhaps for the case of a condensate ) , so that the focal densities are conveniently found as a function of this initial density matrix . as a direct result , while the failure to account for finite beam size effects with the fourier series limits our calculations to the near - field and fresnel diffraction regimes , it is relatively unimportant for atom focusing immediately following the sw pulse .",
    "we can then calculate the effects of chromatic aberration and angular beam divergence by averaging the exact fourier solution over any longitudinal and transverse atomic velocity distributions .",
    "in addition to lithographic detection schemes , one can detect atomic distributions modulated by sw fields by backscattering a pulsed traveling wave probe off of the density either ( a ) at a certain distance from the grating for the beam case or ( b ) after a certain time for the atoms released from a trap .",
    "the scattered signal is sensitive to the lowest - order fourier component@xcite of the modulated density .",
    "previously , the backscattered signal from a cold vapor subjected to strong sw pulses was observed in rb in a ground state echo experiment@xcite .",
    "the excellent agreement between the fourier theory and experiment that was achieved in that case insures that our theoretical approach can be applied to the atom focusing problem as well .",
    "a new regime of atom focusing arises if the sw field is resonant with the transition between a ground and excited state and the time of interaction is less than the excited state lifetime . after propagating from the sw field for a time just long enough for the excited state to decay ,",
    "the atom spatial distribution consists of two parts@xcite : the stimulated density , caused by direct amplitude modulation of the ground state wave function by the field , and the spontaneous density , produced by excitation to and decay from the excited state . as a result of the periodic talbot revival , or",
    "self - imaging @xcite , of the atomic spatial distribution , free evolution of the stimulated part leads to atom focusing not only at the focal distance @xmath9 but also at the distances @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a positive integer , @xmath12 is a talbot length , and @xmath13 is the atom de broglie wavelength .",
    "in contrast to the stimulated part ,  the spontaneous modulation decays at a distance on the order of @xmath14 as a result of the doppler shift associated with spontaneous emission . at a sufficiently large distance , the modulated spontaneous",
    "part disappears , and one can observe and analyze atom focusing by a resonant sw field .",
    "this analysis then reveals a new effect , a rabi - like oscillation of the focal parameters with the atom - field interaction strength that arises from an interference between different components of the matter wave .",
    "this article is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii we consider the focusing by a far - detuned field acting as a phase grating .",
    "focusing by a resonant field acting as an amplitude grating is studied in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to the influence of chromatic aberration ( longitudinal velocity distributions ) and angular beam divergence ( transverse velocity distributions ) .",
    "the quantitative results and illustrative examples are discussed in section v.",
    "atom optical experiments can operate in the spatial or time domain .",
    "for example , in the time domain a vapor of cold atoms interacts with one or more radiation pulses forming spatial gratings in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "correspondingly , in the spatial domain an atom beam traverses one or more optical elements or interaction regions . for a monovelocity beam propagating along the @xmath16 axis with longitudinal velocity @xmath17 and with the optical elements aligned in the @xmath15 direction ,",
    "the spatial domain configurations can be analyzed in the time domain if calculations are performed in the atomic rest frame moving with velocity @xmath17 . in this frame",
    "the optical elements appear as interaction pulses . as a result ,",
    "our calculations are restricted to the time domain without loss of generality ( and are adapted to account for a longitudinal velocity distribution in section iv ) .",
    "we consider the focusing effects of a single pulse .",
    "the atom optical elements couple to the center - of - mass degrees of freedom of an atom with mass @xmath18 and de broglie wavelength @xmath19 .",
    "when the sw laser field , @xmath20 drives the atomic transition between the ground state @xmath21 and the excited state @xmath22 , the schrdinger equation , @xmath23 , governs the motion .",

    "a paraxial approximation is unnecessary , and @xmath45 is simply the wave function .",
    "experimentally@xcite , for focusing it has proven advantageous to optically pump the atoms into an initial ground state with magnetic quantum number @xmath46 and use circularly polarized fields to avoid multiple rabi frequencies in the state dynamics , justifying our two - level approximation .",

    "we follow the experimental findings of natarajan and coworkers@xcite .",

    "before we proceed , a clarification is needed to emphasize the differences between the thin lens ( raman - nath ) and thick lens regimes of the sw atom lens .",
    "some of the quantitative differences have been examined by henkel and coworkers@xcite in relation to fraunhofer diffraction of atoms and from a ray optics ( classical ) perspective by mcclelland for focusing@xcite . for focusing considerations",
    "we assume square pulses , @xmath69 for @xmath70 and zero otherwise , in order to obtain quantitative results .",

    "condition ( [ 27 ] ) arises from the requirement that atoms moving at an angle @xmath375 not be displaced more than @xmath7 at the talbot distance @xmath557 . even though effective focusing requires the displacement to be @xmath558 times smaller asymptotically ( since @xmath559 ) , this displacement occurs at a distance that is @xmath0-times shorter than the talbot distance ( since @xmath560 ) .",
    "this argument is consistent with eqs .",

    "[ fig08 ] :      our work suggests emphatically that the thin sw lens can focus atoms effectively if the angular divergence is cooled near the recoil limit , even in the presence of strong chromatic aberration .",
    "this makes physical sense if one considers that the longitudinal velocity average over slightly different focal regions for each velocity subclass is a slowly - varying integral over the fourier _ amplitudes _ when compared to the more sensitive transverse velocity integral , an average over the doppler _ phases_. atomic beams of the type considered throughout this article can be made in the laboratory with current technology .",
    "in addition to the experimental possibilities for standard atomic beams that limit angular divergence by slit collimation or transverse laser cooling , recent experiments that use higher - order bragg diffraction of a bec to form atomic beams with transverse and longitudinal @xmath385 velocities smaller than the recoil velocity@xcite offer a promising avenue to observe and characterize thin lens focusing effects .",
    "we would even argue that focal patterns nearly identical to those described in this paper have already been achieved but not recognized in recent condensate experiments on the so - called momentum space talbot effect@xcite . in these experiments",
    "a cloud of cold atoms from a condensate interacts with two off - resonant sw pulses , separated by a variable time delay .",
    "the detection scheme is insensitive to fresnel effects as the researchers image the far - field diffraction pattern and therefore the atomic momentum distribution .",
    "however , the accurate fit of the data in that experiment to our raman - nath theory suggests that the thin lens focusing effect is occurring after the first pulse along the sw grating direction .",
