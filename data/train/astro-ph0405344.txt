    "the first extrasolar planets discovered were found around the millisecond pulsar @xcite .",
    "the system consists of ( at least ) three planets , planet  a with approximately a lunar mass , planet  b with @xmath1 , and planet  c with @xmath2 @xcite . although planetary systems around main - sequence stars had been long anticipated and numerous such systems have been found since , pulsar planetary systems were unexpected .",
    "it was assumed that any planets orbiting the pulsar progenitor would have become gravitationally unbound in the supernova that produced the pulsar .",
    "various mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of these planets @xcite , but all generally rely on an accretion disk around the pulsar within which the planets form .",
    "millisecond pulsars are a class of pulsars that , subsequent to their formation , undergo an episode of mass accretion from a companion @xcite .",
    "this process is thought to occur via an accretion disk , which transfers angular momentum to the pulsar as well , thereby spinning it up .",
    "various mechanisms exist to shut down the accretion ( e.g. , evolution of the companion ) , but , if the accretion is not 100% efficient , the millisecond pulsar will be left with an orbiting disk of material .",
    "such a residual accretion disk is a natural location for the formation of planets .",
    "even if planets form , the formation process may leave a debris disk .",
    "@xcite investigated the long - term stability of a debris disk in the system , finding a stable zone outside  1  .    since the discovery of planets around",
    ", a planet has also been found around the pulsar @xcite , in the globular cluster m4 .",
    "in contrast to the planets orbiting , which are thought to have formed _ in situ _ , the planet orbiting is thought to have been acquired during a dynamical exchange within the globular cluster .",
    "pulsar planetary systems offer valuable insights , even if their total number is unlikely ever to approach the number of planetary systems around main - sequence stars . taken together",
    "the two pulsar planetary systems already indicate that planets can form and exist in a wide variety of environments .",
    "the presence of terrestrial mass planets around suggests that terrestrial planets may be widespread , a hypothesis to be tested by future space missions such as kepler and the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) .",
    "planets orbiting main - sequence stars near the sun are found almost exclusively around stars with solar- or super - solar metallicities @xcite , which has led to the belief that only stars with high metallicities can host planets .",
    "in contrast , the planet around , if it was acquired during a dynamical exchange , probably has existed for a substantial fraction of the age of the globular cluster m4 .",
    "this is a low - metallicity globular cluster , suggesting that planets can form in low - metallicity environments .",
    "although the notion that planets can form in a residual accretion disk is plausible , no such examples of residual accretion disks are known .",
    "the presence of a planet ( or stellar companion ) can be inferred using traditional pulsar timing techniques from the periodic advance and delay of the arrival time of the pulsar s pulse , due to the pulsar s reflex motion .",
    "a relatively uniform disk of material would produce little reflex motion and therefore would remain undetected by these traditional techniques . detecting dust disks around millisecond pulsars not only would elucidate the late stages of millisecond pulsar `` spin up '' and planet formation , it would be a new probe of the local environments around millisecond pulsars .",
    "a modest number of unsuccessful searches for infrared emission from dust disks around millisecond pulsars have been conducted .",
    "figure  [ fig : b1257 + 12 ] summarizes the current situation using as an example .",
    "the limits for other pulsars are similar .    this paper reports 60 and  90  observations of  7 pulsars with the isophot instrument onboard the iso satellite . in  [ sec : observe ] we describe the observations and present our results and in  [ sec : discuss ] we describe how our results constrain the presence of dust disks around millisecond pulsars and present our conclusions .",
    "we compiled a list of millisecond pulsars known prior to 1994  august and with distances less than 1  kpc .",
    "distances are estimated from the @xcite model and should be accurate to approximately 25% .",
    "most of these millisecond pulsars lie at high galactic latitudes .    of these ,",
    "seven were observed with the isophot instrument @xcite onboard the iso satellite @xcite between  1996 august and  1997 may .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] summarizes the observing details ; we also report the distance to each pulsar and , anticipating later discussion , whether or not it is a binary and its spin - down luminosity .",
    ", where @xmath3 is its moment of inertia and  @xmath4 is its rotation frequency . ]",
    "all of the observations used the p32 observing mode with the c100 detector . in this mode",
    "the spacecraft was commanded to cover a series of raster pointings around the nominal pulsar position . at each raster pointing an internal chopper pointed the beam toward  13 adjacent sky positions .",
    "the throw of the chopper was larger than the offset between raster pointings .",
    "the result was that , in general , an individual sky position within the raster was observed multiple times or oversampled . before and after each observation of a pulsar , an internal calibration source was observed .",

    "the key difference was the amount of `` deglitching '' performed .",
    "glitches result from cosmic rays striking the detector or secondary electrons produced by spacecraft materials struck by primary cosmic rays .",
    "failure to remove glitches can corrupt later calibration of _ all _ data , not just of the portion containing the glitches .",
    "the standard isophot analysis pipeline removes glitches but does so without making use of the redundancy implicit in the oversampled p32 observations .",
    "deglitching proceeded in the following fashion . within each spacecraft",
    "pointing the chopper would sweep past a particular sky position multiple times ( typically 35 times ) . for each sky position ,",
    "the median signal level was determined , then subtracted from all observations at that sky position .",
    "the observations from all sky positions were then combined to form a signal strength histogram .",
    "a signal strength threshold was specified , and signals above this level were eliminated .",
    "typically 3%10% of the signals were eliminated in this stage .",
    "depending upon the number of chopper sweeps per spacecraft pointing and deglitching prior to this stage , the median signal strength per sky position could not always be determined accurately .",
    "thus , additional manual deglitching was done to remove any remaining outlier signals .",
    "our use of the observations of the internal calibration sources followed the standard isophot analysis pipeline .",
    "after deglitching and calibration using the internal calibration sources , mapping was done within the isophot interactive analysis package .",
    "measurements from the individual detector pixels were co - added to form a sky image , with the contributions from the individual detector pixels weighted by their distances from the image pixels .",
    "doing so takes into account the beam profile falling on each detector pixel .",
    "we also employed a median flat field , which has the effect of reducing substantially our sensitivity to any extended emission in the field .",
    "as we are attempting to detect point sources , we regard this reduced sensitivity to extended emission as unimportant .    in no case",
    "have we identified a source at the location of a pulsar . utilizing the inner quarter of the image , we determined the rms noise level .",
    "we take our upper limits to be 3 times this rms noise level .",
    "table  [ tab : limits ] summarizes the upper limits .",
    "lc    & 80 + & 35 + & 190 + & 100 + & 100 + & 59 +    & 48 + & 59 + & 140 + & 55 + & 73 + & 39 +",
    "we have not detected infrared emission associated with any of the pulsars observed with .",
    "other infrared and sub - millimeter observations of millisecond pulsars have been conducted , and all of these have yielded only upper limits as well . those observations most relevant to our sample of millisecond pulsars are those by @xcite at  10  and @xcite at  850  .",
    "@xcite also utilized iras observations to obtain upper limits on the infrared emission from their sample of pulsars .",
    "as figure  [ fig : b1257 + 12 ] shows , the upper limits set by iras are typically well above the limits set by our iso observations .",
    "moreover , there is unfortunately little overlap between these three samples of pulsars ( those whose observations are reported here , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "most of the pulsars that have been observed between  10 and  850  have been observed at only one or two wavelengths .",
    "@xcite developed a model for the infrared emission from a dust disk around a millisecond pulsar .",
    "their model assumes that the disk consists of particles of a uniform radius  @xmath8 heated by a fraction  @xmath9 of the pulsar s spin - down luminosity  l@xmath10 .",
    "the total mass of the disk is @xmath11 .",
    "while the model is simplistic  an actual dust disk presumably consists of particles with a range of sizes , the heating mechanism is left unspecified , non - equilibrium effects such as stochastic heating are ignored , and the impact of any stellar companions ( see table  [ tab : log ] ) on the disk are ignored ",
    "we believe that this simplicity is justified given the uncertainties of the heating mechanism and of the environs of a millisecond pulsar .    in this model , for @xmath12% , typical dust temperatures are predicted to be @xmath1350  k for disks having @xmath14  m@xmath0 and  @xmath15  and heated by a pulsar with l@xmath16  l@xmath17 .",
    "these temperatures are similar to the lower temperature range used by @xcite and considerably lower than those assumed ( @xmath18  k ) by @xcite , who estimated disk temperatures by scaling from observations of t  tauri stars .",
    "the lower temperatures result from our assumption of a weaker coupling between the pulsar s spin - down luminosity and the disk .",
    "@xcite considered disk temperature to be a major uncertainty in converting from measured flux densities to inferred disk masses . accordingly , our assumption of a weaker coupling means that larger disk masses can be tolerated without violating the observational constraints .",
    "given the paucity of data , it is not possible , in general , to constrain all three parameters of this model with the existing observations .",
    "we therefore adopt an approach in which we infer limits on two parameters of the foster & fischer  ( 1996 ) model for fiducial values of the third parameter . here , as an example , we consider the millisecond pulsar @xcite which has a probable white dwarf companion , is at a distance of  1  kpc , and has a spin - down luminosity of  10  l@xmath17 .",
    "greaves & holland  ( 2000 ) placed a @xmath19 limit of  3.7  mjy at 850  , and we place a @xmath19 limit of  50  mjy at  90  .",
    "figure  [ fig : like2 ] shows the allowed region of the disk mass - grain size plane given these observational limits and an assumed heating efficiency of @xmath20% .    allowed regions in the @xmath11-@xmath8 plane occur for one of two possible reasons .",
    "first , the peak of the dust disk emission may appear shortward of  90  , where no constraints exist for this pulsar , with the rayleigh - jeans tail of the emission falling below the two measured values .",
    "this region is to the lower left in figure  [ fig : like2 ] .",
    "second , the peak of the emission may appear between  90  and  850  , but with a magnitude comparable to that measured at  90  so that the rayleigh - jeans tail again does not violate the 850  limit while the wien tail of the emission does not violate the 90  limit .",
    "this region is to the lower right in figure  [ fig : like2 ] .",
    "obviously , a lower value of  @xmath9 would produce larger allowed regions in the @xmath11-@xmath8 plane .",
    "larger allowed regions would also exist for other pulsars ( table  [ tab : log ] ) with smaller spin - down luminosities .",
    "we conclude that , with the current observational constraints and the assumption of a fairly weak energy coupling between pulsars and disks , dust disks of order 100  m@xmath0 easily could exist around millisecond pulsars . @xcite",
    "have reached similar conclusions based on  15 and  90  observations . to the extent that such disks would be uniform",
    ", they would also escape detection from traditional pulsar timing techniques .",
    "pulsar timing techniques utilize the advance or delay of the pulse arrival time resulting from the pulsar s reflex motion to detect planetary or stellar companions .",
    "a relatively uniform dust disk would produce little reflex motion .",
    "the current limits on dust disk masses are far larger than the mass of the disk thought to have produced the planets around .",
    "the minimum combined mass of the two larger planets in that system is 8.2  m@xmath0 @xcite . assuming that these planets are composed largely of metals",
    ", we expect that any dust mass prior to the planets formation would be comparable in magnitude .",
    "indeed , @xcite has shown how an initial disk of mass 0.1@xmath21  m@xmath17 containing of order 10  m@xmath0 in metals could form a system similar to that orbiting .",
    "( see also @xcite and figure  [ fig : b1257 + 12 ] . ) for those pulsars orbited by stellar companions , the companions will introduce regions of limited orbital stability within the disks , potentially implying even smaller expected disk masses .",
    "we conclude that current observational limits on dust disk masses are at least an order of magnitude above plausible values .",
    "the mid- to far - infrared detectors ( 24 , 70 , and  160  ) on the spitzer space telescope should have sensitivities some 12 orders of magnitude better than the limits we report here . at a minimum",
    ", we expect that future observations with the spitzer space telescope may require more sophisticated modelling of disks , including the possible effects of stellar companions . if future observations with the spitzer space telescope do not detect infrared emission from dust disks around millisecond pulsars , the resulting mass limits should be in the range of  10  m@xmath0 , sufficient to begin placing stringent constraints on their existence , or the temperatures of any pulsar dust disks must be no more than a few kelvin .",
    "we thank the organizers of the isophot workshop on pht32 oversampled mapping , particularly r.  tuffs , c.  gabriel , n.  lu , and b.  schulz for their many helpful discussions , and r.  tuffs for his deglitching software . without their assistance ,",
    "no results would be reported here .",
    "we thank the referee for comments that helped us clarify certain points and c.  chandler for helpful discussions .",
    "the results reported here are based on observations with iso , an esa project with instruments funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : france , germany , the netherlands and the united kingdom ) and with the participation of isas and nasa .",
