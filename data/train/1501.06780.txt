    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "our renewed interest in the hencky energy is motivated by a recent finding that the hencky energy ( not the logarithmic strain itself ) exhibits a fundamental property . by purely differential geometric reasoning , in forthcoming papers @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) it will be shown that @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the canonical left invariant geodesic distance on the lie group @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 denote the corresponding geodesic distances on the lie groups @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand , some constitutive issues ,",
    "e.g. the invertible true - stress - true - strain relation and the monotonicity of the cauchy stress tensor as a function of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the left cauchy - green tensor , recommend the energies from our family of exponentiated energies as good candidates in the study of nonlinear deformations .",
    "moreover , in the first part @xcite it is shown that the proposed energies have some other very useful properties : analytical solutions are in agreement with bell s experimental data ; planar pure cauchy shear stress produces biaxial pure shear strain and the value 0.5 of poisson s ratio corresponds to exact incompressibility .",
    "it is found @xcite that the analytical expression of the pressure is in concordance with the classical bridgman s compression data for natural rubber .",
    "an immediate application to rubber - like materials is proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have also shown that the energies from the family of exponentiated energies improve several features of the formulation with respect to mathematical issues regarding well - posedness .",
    "we have established that , in planar elasto - statics , the exponentiated energies @xmath29 satisfy the legendre - hadamard condition ( rank - one convexity ) @xcite for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , while they are polyconvex @xcite for @xmath8 , @xmath7 and satisfy a coercivity estimate @xcite for @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "these results now allow us to show the existence of minimizers @xcite for @xmath8 , @xmath7 .",
    "the notion of polyconvexity has been introduced into the framework of elasticity by john ball in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "various nonlinear issues , results and extensive references are collected in dacorogna @xcite .",
    "in the two dimensional case , a free energy function @xmath32 is called polyconvex if and only if it is expressible in the form @xmath33 , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is convex .",
    "polyconvexity is the cornerstone notion for a proof of the existence of minimizers by the direct methods of the calculus of variations for energy functions satisfying no polynomial growth conditions , which is the case in nonlinear elasticity since one has the natural requirement @xmath36 as @xmath37 .",
    "polyconvexity is best understood for isotropic energy functions , but it is not restricted to isotropic response . the polyconvexity condition in the case of space dimension 2 was conclusively discussed by rosakis @xcite and ilhav @xcite , while the case of arbitrary spatial dimension was studied by mielke @xcite .",
    "the @xmath38-dimensional case of the theorem established by ball @xcite has been reconsidered by dacorogna and marcellini @xcite , dacorogna and koshigoe @xcite and dacorogna and marechal @xcite .",
    "it was a long standing open question how to extend the notion of polyconvexity in a meaningful way to anisotropic materials @xcite .",
    "an answer has been provided in a series of papers @xcite .",
    "rank - one convexity domains for the hencky energy @xmath39 ^ 2\\,\\ ] ] have been established in @xcite .",
    "satisfaction of the baker - ericksen inequalities in terms of the logarithmic strain tensor is discussed in @xcite , while necessary conditions for legendre - hadamard ellipticity are given in @xcite .",
    "we have remarked that the rank - one convexity holds true for @xmath6 , while the polyconvexity holds true for @xmath8 .",
    "hence , the following question arose : is there a gap for @xmath40 ? in a previous work",
    "we have used the sufficiency condition for polyconvexity which has been discovered by steigmann @xcite .",
    "eventually , it is based on a polyconvexity criterion of ball @xcite , but it allows one to express polyconvexity directly in terms of the principal isotropic invariants of the right stretch tensor @xmath41 ( see also @xcite ) . as it turns out , in plane elastostatics ,",
    "steigmann s criterion is already hidden in another sufficiency criterion for polyconvexity given earlier by rosakis @xcite . however , steigmann s criterion is clearly not necessary for polyconvexity .",
    "hence , our previous results may be improved .    in this paper",
    ", we use a direct approach based on the fact that the function @xmath42 given by @xmath43 is convex for @xmath6 and it is also increasing for @xmath44 , while @xmath45 given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the largest singular values ( principal stretches ) of @xmath48 , is polyconvex .",
    "therefore , we prove that the exponentiated hencky energies are in fact polyconvex for @xmath6 and the main existence results is also valid for these values of the fitting parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the static problem in the planar case consists in finding the solution @xmath50 of the equilibrium equation @xmath51 where the first piola - kirchhoff stress tensor corresponding to the energy @xmath52 is given by the constitutive equation @xmath53 ^ 2}\\,\\tr(\\log u)\\cdot \\id\\right]f^{-t } ,   \\qquad x\\in\\overline{\\omega},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath54 .",
    "the above system of equations is supplemented , in the case of the mixed problem , by the boundary conditions @xmath55 where @xmath56 are subsets of the boundary @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the unit outward normal to the boundary and @xmath61 are prescribed fields .      in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the following results were established .",

    "then the function @xmath67 is convex if and only if @xmath68    this lemma together with a results established in @xcite led to :    [ corolarbun](convexity of the volumetric part ) @xcite the function @xmath69 is rank - one convex in @xmath48 for @xmath70 .",

    "( -25,40 ) ( -90,90 ) ( -155,120 )    hence , in order to prove the polyconvexity of @xmath85 , in view of lemma [ lemajh ] , it is suffices to prove that @xmath90 is polyconvex , since we have the following result :    if @xmath91 is increasing and convex and @xmath45 is polyconvex , then @xmath92 is polyconvex .",
    "this is proved in exactly the same way as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.1 ) ; only the elements @xmath93 and @xmath94 of the proof have to be interpreted as pairs @xmath95 , where @xmath63 and @xmath96 .",
    "the generalization to arbitrary dimension , if needed , is straightforward .",
    "the function @xmath90 is polyconvex on @xmath97 .",
    "an elementary evaluation of the hessian matrix shows that for @xmath98 the function @xmath99 is convex on @xmath100 if and only if @xmath101 .",
    "we take @xmath102 and @xmath103 and we observe that @xmath104 for every @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath106 for each @xmath107 and @xmath96 .",
    "using the well - known fact that @xmath108 ( the largest singular value ) is convex ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.3 ) and also appendix [ convmax ] ) , we now prove that @xmath109 is convex .",
    "indeed , since @xmath110 is increasing in the first argument , we have for any @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and any @xmath113 , @xmath114 , that @xmath115 where we used the convexity of @xmath110 asserted above .",
    "thus @xmath116 is polyconvex .",
    "therefore , we conclude :    if @xmath6 , then the function @xmath117 is polyconvex on @xmath97 .    in view of the above proposition and using corollary [ corolarbun ]",
    "we conclude that :    [ mainth ] the functions @xmath118 from the family of exponentiated hencky type energies are polyconvex for @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "in plane elastostatics , having proved the coercivity and the polyconvexity of the energy @xmath122 for @xmath6 and @xmath123 , it is a standard matter to improve the existence results established in @xcite .",

    ". then the problem @xmath130 admits at least one solution .",
