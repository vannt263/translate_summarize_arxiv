    "observations of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have revealed that many of them are obscured by material ( dust and gas ) located within the inner tens of parsecs of the central engine ( see e.g. bianchi et al .",
    "2012 for a review ) and intercepted by our line of sight .",
    "this obscuring material will influence both the agn and our observations , and the study of its properties is fundamental for an unbiased understanding of agn physics .",
    "for example obscuration by gas and dust is a key ingredient of the agn unified scheme , which proposes that type 2 and type 1 agn are intrinsically the same type of object viewed from different orientation angles ( antonucci 1993 ) : when our line of sight does not intercept any absorbing material the source is classified as a type 1 agn while in the opposite case , where we see obscuring gas and dust , the source is defined as a type 2 agn .",
    "the absorbing material which determines the two main flavours of active galaxies is most likely a toroidal structure ( doughnut like or clumpy ) thought to be present in all agn .",
    "+ how many objects are absorbed or not and what is the distribution of absorption among all objects are important information for agn studies . cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) synthesis models , in the context of the agn unification theory and based on a combination of absorbed and unabsorbed agn , have been quite successful in reproducing the overall broadband spectral shape of the observed background ( gilli et al .",
    "2007 ) , but they need accurate observational information on the absorption parameter . absorbed sources constitute also an important ingredient for the ir and the sub - mm backgrounds , where most of the absorbed radiation is re - emitted by dust ( e.g. fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) . +",
    "many important issues related to the population of absorbed agn are still to be understood , like the number of type 2 qso , the nature of the x - ray bright optical normal galaxies ( xbong ) , the role of liners and the relationship between optical absorption and x - ray obscuration .",
    "+ because of the effect it may have on observations , absorption can be problematic for surveys performed at various wavebands and this is the main motivation for performing agn surveys above 20 kev .",
    "+ in this work we have gathered a large number ( 272 ) of agn detected by integral , collected their optical classification and x - ray column density measurements in order to be able to study the absorption properties in a large sample of hard x - ray selected agn , explore the nature of absorption in xbongs , type 2 qso s and liners and finally compare the optical classification with the x - ray absorption as a tool to test the agn unification theory .",
    "+ it is worth noting that these studies have often been performed employing samples of agn observed in the soft ( below 20 kev ) x - ray band and only recently with the advent of enough agn being detected at higher x - ray energies have similar studies been attempted for the first time . + the paper is organized as follows : the integral agn catalogue is presented in section 2 , the study of absorption properties including a discussion on the fraction of heavily absorbed objects is reported in section 3 , peculiar objects belonging to the liner , xbong and type 2 qso classes are presented in section 4 . in section 5 the optical classification versus",
    "x - ray absorption has been treated and in subsections 5.1 and 5.2 the absorbed type 1 agn and unabsorbed type 2 agn have been discussed .",
    "the summary and conclusions are drawn in section 6 .",
    "in the 4th integral / ibis survey ( bird et al . 2010 ) there are 234 objects which have been identified with agn .",
    "to this set of sources , we have then added 38 galaxies listed in the integral all - sky survey by krivonos et al .",
    "( 2007 ) updated on the website but not included in the bird et al .",
    "catalogue due to the different sky coverage ( see source names in bold in the appendix ) .",
    "the final dataset presented and discussed in this work therefore comprises 272 agn ( last update march 2011 ) , which represents the most complete view of the integral extragalactic sky to date .",
    "although new source identifications / classifications are continuously coming in ( e.g. masetti et al . 2012 ) , they are not considered in the present dataset because they are not properly characterized in x - rays ( see below ) . in the appendix we present the full catalogue , listing all 272 integral agn together with their optical coordinates , redshift , class , 20 - 100 kev flux and x - ray data ( 2 - 10 kev flux , column density and reference work from which these data have been taken ) .",
    "+ the sample has two great strengths : a ) all sources have optical spectra , which means a secure identification and a measured redshift ( the only exception is the bl lac object rx j0137.7 + 5814 for which no redshift measure is available ) , and b ) all sources have x - ray data available , which provides a measure of the intrinsic absorption in each source . until recently",
    ", 34 sources did not have x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) coverage mainly due to the fact that they are newly discovered agn ; for these sources x - ray data available from the swift and xmm - newton archives have been analysed and the results were published by malizia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) except for igr j04221 + 4856 which has been recently observed by swift and the measurements of 2 - 10 kev flux and column density are reported here for the first time ( see table in the appendix ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that for each source we have verified that the x - ray counterpart of the ibis object corresponds to the optical identification . + in order to assign to each object the most appropriate optical class , we have searched the literature thoroughly and when possible have also compared the class reported in ned ( nasa extragalactic database ) with that listed in the 13th edition of the veron - cetty , veron extragalactic catalogue ( 2010 ) ; a significant number of agn in the sample have been classified through our own follow up work ( masetti et al . 2012 and references therein ) . in these cases , we have adopted the classification criteria of veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) and the line ratio diagnostics of both ho et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1997 ) and kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; for assigning seyfert subclasses ( 1.2 , 1.5 , 1.8 , and 1.9 ) , we have used the h@xmath1/[oiii]@xmath25007 line flux ratio criterion described in winkler ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have generally preferred the most recent classification and , in case of conflicting results , we have always checked the optical spectra before assigning the most appropriate optical type . + the overall result is a list of agn properly characterized at optical , soft and hard x - ray frequencies thus available for population studies .",
    "+ in figure 1 the whole sample is reported in the classical 20 - 100 kev luminosity @xmath3 redshift plot .",
    "the luminosities have been calculated for all sources assuming h@xmath4=71 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and q@xmath4 = 0 .",
    "all agn have been plotted using three different symbols and following the optical classification ( broad line ( bl ) and narrow ( nl ) agn plus blazar ) ; a more detailed analysis of the various optical classes also in terms of absorption , can be found in section 5 . from figure 1",
    "it can be estimated that our sensitivity limit is around 1.5 @xmath6 10@xmath7 erg @xmath8 s@xmath5 .",
    "we find that the source redshifts span from 0.0014 to 3.7 with a mean at @xmath9=0.1477 and a peak in the distribution at @xmath9 = 0.015 ; while the log of 20 - 100 kev luminosities ( in erg s@xmath5 ) ranges from 40.7 to @xmath048 with a mean at around 46 , although the peak of the distribution is at 43.9 .",
    "ngc 4395 ( a seyfert 2 ) is the closest and least luminous agn seen by integral , while igr j22517 + 2218 ( a broad line qso ) is the farthest and most luminous one ; the former hosts a relatively small central black hole ( m @xmath010@xmath10 - 10@xmath11 m@xmath12 , filippenko & ho 2003 ) while the latter houses a more massive object ( m = 10@xmath13 m@xmath12 , de rosa private communication ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the present integral sample spans a large range in source parameters and is therefore representative of the population of agn selected in the hard x - ray band .",
    "since hard x - ray selected samples provide the most accurate estimate of the fraction of absorbed objects as well as of compton thick agn , we can use the present sample for this purpose .",
    "the column density distribution for the entire sample is shown in figure 2 . here and in the following we assume n@xmath14 = 10@xmath15 @xmath8 as the dividing line",
    "between absorbed and unabsorbed sources : this is the value conventionally used because it corresponds to a column density sufficiently high to hide the broad line region ( blr , silverman et al .",
    "it is also worth noting that for a number of objects we did not measure any absorption in excess of the galactic value and have therefore used the galactic column density as an upper limit to the source intrinsic absorption . with the assumptions made above the fraction of absorbed objects present in our sample is 48% as can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "+ within our catalogue we find 15 mildly ( 1.5 @xmath6 10@xmath16 @xmath17 n@xmath14 @xmath17 10@xmath18 @xmath8 ) and 3 heavily ( n@xmath19 10@xmath18 @xmath8 ) compton thick agn ( the full list of objects can be extracted from the table in the appendix ) ; we therefore estimate the fraction of compton thick objects to be around @xmath07% , in full agreement with estimates available in the literature ( malizia et al .",
    "2009 , burlon et al .",
    "despite the fact that hard x - ray instruments are the least biased in terms of detecting absorbed agn , they still miss some compton thick objects , essentially those with weak ( intrinsic ) fluxes and at large distances .",
    "this has been fully discussed by malizia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and burlon et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , who have shown that once the correction for this bias is applied the real intrinsic fraction of compton - thick agn is around 20 - 24% . in particular , in our previous work ( malizia et al .",
    "2009 ) we have adopted a redshift cut ( z=0.015 or 60 mpc ) in a complete sample of integral agn in order to remove the bias and to probe , although only locally , the entire agn population . following this reasoning and using the present much larger sample of objects",
    ", we should be able to expand this study and to confirm our previous hypothesis , having in mind that the present sample is not complete .",
    "for comparison with our previous study , we have divided our sample in the same bins of redshift ( up to z=0.57 considering only the agn with log l@xmath20 46 ) and plotted the fraction of absorbed ( n@xmath2110@xmath15 @xmath8 ) objects compared to the total number of agn in these bins .",
    "the result is shown in figure 3 for the present sample ( red points ) and for that used in malizia et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( black points ) .",
    "+ a number of considerations can be made from this figure : first , the bias is still present as we keep observing a trend of decreasing fraction of absorbed objects as the redshift increases ; second , we note that in the first bin the fraction of absorbed objects remains the same as found in our previous analysis : in particular we find that , over the 66 objects present in this bin , 53 ( or 80% ) have a column density @xmath22 10@xmath15 and 11 ( or 17% @xmath23 3% ) are compton thick .",
    "taking into consideration the fact that this is not a complete sample , these results are in close agreement with those found previously and confirm our original suggestion that our survey is able to pick up all agn , even the most absorbed , but only in the local universe .",
    "finally , we note that the fraction of absorbed ( and compton thick ) agn has increased in the second bin from 35% to 57% ( including 4 compton thick sources ) , implying that as the integral survey enlarges , we are able to pick up more absorbed objects among those which are distant and faint and therefore lost in previous catalogues .",
    "we have also looked for a trend of decreasing fraction of absorbed agn with increasing source hard x - ray luminosities .",
    "this effect , which is well documented in the x - ray band ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 , hasinger et al .",
    "2005 , la franca et al .",
    "2005 , della ceca et al .",
    "2008 ) , has also been observed at higher energies ( bassani et al .",
    "2006 , sazonov et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) and is found in our sample too . in figure 4",
    "we show how the fraction of the agn with n@xmath14 @xmath24 10@xmath15 @xmath8 in the integral sample changes with 20 - 100 kev luminosity where the width of each bin has been chosen so that the number of objects in each is constant ( @xmath034 ) .",
    "again , the fraction of absorbed sources is around 80% at low luminosities , decreasing to @xmath020% at higher luminosities . at the moment",
    "it is not possible to discriminate as to whether the redshift effect may have contaminated this result or if it is a direct consequence of the evolution of agn luminosity function with @xmath9 , but this issue will be addressed in more detail in a dedicated paper .",
    "+ summarizing our results , we conclude that the bias effecting deep hard x - ray surveys of agn is real but negligible if we deal with objects located in the nearby universe , where the `` true '' fraction of absorbed and compton thick objects can be estimated with some precision at 80% and @xmath017% respectively .",
    "a few interesting classes of objects are now emerging in the integral surveys ; these are discussed in some detail in the following sub - sections .",
    "one of the most interesting findings of recent soft x - ray surveys is the existence of xbongs , i.e. x - ray bright optically normal galaxies ( comastri et al .",
    "these sources are characterized by an x - ray luminosity of 10@xmath25 - 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath5 but are optically dull , i.e. they are hosted by normal galaxies whose optical spectra show no emission lines .",
    "different interpretations have been suggested to explain these unusual properties ( trump et al .",
    "2009 ) including : heavy obscuration by gas covering almost 4@xmath27 of the nuclear source ; a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) which provides a featureless hard x - ray spectrum and negligible emission in the optical and uv bands ; and finally dilution of nuclear emission from the host galaxy starlight which prevents the detection of the agn optical spectrum ( moran et al . 2002 ) .",
    "+ although these explanations provide a good description of the observed properties of a few objects , the nature of xbongs is still the subject of debate and recent studies suggest that they could be a mixed bag of different source typologies ( civano et al .",
    "+ in the present sample of integral agn there are 5 objects classified as xbong ( see table in the appendix ) ; all 5 are heavily absorbed in x - rays ( log n@xmath14 from @xmath023 up to @xmath2224 @xmath8 ) and quite bright ( l@xmath28 in the range 6@xmath610@xmath29 - 6@xmath610@xmath26 erg s@xmath5 ) . clearly , option one is a viable explanation to account for their properties , while it is difficult to reconcile a riaf accretion model with the x - ray brightness of our objects .",
    "we also note that 4 out of 5 sources are optically very bright as they are listed in the usno b1 catalogue with r @xmath1710.3 ; the only exception is igr j17009 + 3559 which has r=14.4 but is also the xbong with the highest redshift ( z=0.13 ) .",
    "this suggests that the dilution hypothesis ( bright galaxy host ) combined with heavy obscuration may be the explanation for the peculiar optical classification of our objects .",
    "type 2 qso are the high redshift / high luminosity counterparts of local seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "they play an important role in our understanding of the universe as their existence in considerable numbers is needed for the synthesis of the x - ray background ( gilli et al .",
    "they are also important objects in the subject of the evolution of absorption with intrinsic luminosity and/or redshift ; this is an issue which is still matter of intensive debate , but potentially very important for the influence that it can have on many astrophysical issues . +",
    "despite much effort put into their search / quest , very few type 2 qso have so far been found especially at very high redshifts .",
    "they are hard to discover because a significant fraction of their emitted power is absorbed by an optically thick torus and , since they are distant / faint , they are missed by most surveys ; in particular , the lack of emission lines over a wide wavelength range hampers their identification in the optical .",
    "hard x - ray surveys are ideally suited for this purpose as they can penetrate the torus in most objects .",
    "the definition of type 2 qso is somewhat arbitrary and depends on the waveband used to find them . in x",
    "- rays the definition first introduced by mainieri et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is generally adopted : a type 2 qso has to have an intrinsic x - ray luminosity of l @xmath30 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath5 ( 0.5 - 10 kev ) and an absorbing hydrogen column density of n@xmath14 @xmath30 10@xmath15 @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have 0.5 - 10 kev luminosity information for all our objects , but can adopt the 2 - 10 kev band as a measure of the x - ray brightness and the same threshold in luminosity ( @xmath30 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath5 ) and column density ( n@xmath14 @xmath3010@xmath15 @xmath8 ) used by mainieri et al .",
    "+ we have 12 sources fulfilling the above criteria ; however 4 of then are local seyferts ( @xmath310.1 ) and can not be considered as type 2 qso while 2 of them , pks 1830 - 211 and igr j22517 + 2218 are high redshift blazars in which the high column density measured may not be related to the toroidal structure implied by the agn unified theory .",
    "pks 1830 - 211 ( z = 2.507 ) is a complicated system , gravitationally lensed by an intervening galaxy at z = 0.89 .",
    "the observed flattening in the x - ray spectrum at low energies has been interpreted in other ways : either as absorption coming from the lensing galaxy , or due to a change in the source spectral shape related to its blazar nature ( zhang et al .",
    "this last interpretation has also been used in the case of the other absorbed blazar igr j22517 + 2218 ( bassani et al .",
    "the other source to explain is igr j10147 - 6354 , classified as a seyfert 1.2 at z=0.2 , where the absorption , as well as in other type 1 agn , is less easy to understand and will be the subject of an in - depth analysis in section 5 .",
    "+ we are left with 5 objects which display evident narrow emission lines in their optical spectra and therefore qualify to be type 2 qso : igr j00465 - 4005 , swift j0216.3 + 5128 , igr j09523 - 6231 , igr j12288 + 0052 and igr j23524 + 5842 .",
    "only igr j09523 - 6231 is a type 1.9 agn implying that a weak broad h@xmath1 emission line is present in its optical spectrum .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev luminosity of these objects goes from 3.6 @xmath6 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath5 to 5.6 @xmath6 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath5 while in the 20 - 100 kev band ranges from 7.6 @xmath6 10@xmath26 erg s@xmath5 to 7.8 @xmath6 10@xmath32 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the maximum absorption is measured in igr j00465 - 4005 with n@xmath14",
    "@xmath0 2.4 @xmath6 10@xmath33 @xmath8 ( landi et al .",
    "despite early indications that igr j12288 + 0052 could be a compton thick agn ( vignali et al .",
    "2010 ) we find that it is only moderately absorbed ( fiocchi et al .",
    "2010 , but see considerations in section 5.2 ) ; it is also the source at the highest redshift ( 0.5756 ) within this group .",
    "+ type 2 qso constitute therefore a small fraction ( 2% ) of the entire agn population selected in the hard x - ray band ; they are outnumber by type 1 qso implying that are either more rare or more difficult to find .",
    "+ finally , type 2 qso have often been associated with very red objects and some authors ( gandhi et al .",
    "2004 ; severgnini et al .",
    "2005 ) have even suggested a connection with ero ( extremely red objects ) .",
    "ero are characterized as having r - k colour @xmath30 5 ( severgnini et al . 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "we have collected this information for 4 out 5 sources and found that r - k is in the range 2.3 - 5.6 ; only igr j12288 + 0052 is marginally compatible with being a ero but its r - k value is only an upper limit .",
    "we can therefore conclude that probably none of our sources qualifies to be an ero .",
    "low - ionization nuclear emission regions ( liners ) were identified as a class of galaxies by heckman ( 1980 ) based on the relative intensities of their oxygen emission lines .",
    "suggestions for the ultimate power source of these objects include ( 1 ) a weak active galactic nucleus harboring an accreting , supermassive black hole , ( 2 ) hot stars ( either young or old ) and ( 3 ) shocks .",
    "recent radio , uv , and x - ray surveys at high spatial resolution , mid - ir spectroscopy , and variability studies have uncovered weak agn in the majority of liners studied so far , suggesting that they make up a large ( perhaps the largest ) subset of all agn ( eracleous et al .",
    "2010 ) . furthermore ,",
    "as suggested by ho ( 1999 ) the detection of broad lines in the optical spectra of many liners constitute strong evidence in favour of the agn interpretation .",
    "as seyfert galaxies , also liners can be classified in two classes , 1 and 2 , depending on whether or not a broad component in their optical spectra can be seen . + in our sample , a number of objects ( 11 ) have liner features : in the optical diagnostic diagrams used for agn optical classification , 6 fall at the boundary with seyfert 2 galaxies and 3 at the boundary with seyfert 1 galaxies ; the first are absorbed in x - rays while the second are not .",
    "two objects lie in the region occupied by `` pure '' liners and are also absorbed in x - rays ; both display only narrow lines in their optical spectra .",
    "so we conclude that , like seyfert galaxies , also liners come in two flavours : unabsorbed type 1 and absorbed type 2 .",
    "given their high x - ray luminosities , it is almost certain that all of these objects are powered by agn , although their 20 - 100 kev mean luminosity ( @xmath01.7 @xmath6 10@xmath25 erg s@xmath5 ) is slightly lower than that of seyfert galaxies ( @xmath05.5 @xmath6 10@xmath25 erg s@xmath5 ) ."
