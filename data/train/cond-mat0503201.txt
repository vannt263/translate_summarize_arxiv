    "this paper deals with physical situations when one or two `` guest '' charges , say arbitrarily charged colloidal particles with a hard core of radius @xmath3 , are immersed in a classical electrolyte modelled by an infinite coulomb gas of positive / negative unit charges . in order to obtain explicit results we consider the point - like limit of the guest charges , i.e. @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a characteristic correlation length of electrolyte species ;",
    "the obtained results are not expected to be applicable to large - sized colloids . if the charges of the guest particles are sufficiently large , anomalous counterintuitive phenomena emerge in the system @xcite",
    ".    one of such phenomena is the appearance , under some circumstances , of an effective ( i.e. , mediated by the electrolyte ) attraction between like - charged colloids . while the traditional dlvo theory @xcite always predicts an effective repulsion between two like - charged colloids @xcite , experimental measurements @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite provide evidence for attraction , especially within confined geometries ( close to a dielectric wall or between two glass plates ) but also in the bulk of the electrolyte @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the effective attraction of two like - charged colloids in the presence of a single wall can arise also from a non - equilibrium hydrodynamic effect @xcite .",
    "another interesting effect is the overcharging , or the charge inversion , of a highly charged colloid @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs when the number of electrolyte counterions in the vicinity of the colloidal surface becomes so high that the colloidal bare charge is locally overcompensated .",
    "the charge inversion has been observed experimentally by electrophoresis @xcite and in simulations @xcite .",
    "its theoretical explanation is based on wigner - crystal theories @xcite .",
    "the latter effect is related to the concept of renormalized charge @xcite .",
    "the true electric potential far from the colloid immersed in a weakly - coupled electrolyte is supposed to exhibit the debye - hckel form , but with a renormalized - charge prefactor which is different from the bare charge of the colloid .",
    "an important feature , which occurs in the framework of the nonlinear poisson - boltzmann equation , is that the renormalized charge saturates monotonically at some finite value when the colloidal bare charge goes to infinity @xcite .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of a salt - free colloidal cell model @xcite indicate the existence of a maximum in the plot of the renormalized charge versus the bare colloidal charge .",
    "tllez and trizac @xcite considered the possibility of a more general phenomenon of _ potential _ saturation .",
    "a theoretical elucidation of anomalous phenomena requires to go beyond mean - field approximations by incorporating electrostatic correlations among electrolyte particles .",
    "heuristic phenomenological approaches applied so far are based on plausible , but not rigorously justified , arguments .",
    "some exactly solvable models are needed .",
    "the best candidates are two - dimensional ( 2d ) coulomb systems with logarithmic pairwise interactions among the charged constituents .",
    "the 2d coulomb gas of @xmath0 unit point - like charges is stable against the collapse of positive - negative pairs of charges at high enough temperatures , namely for @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the ( dimensionless ) inverse temperature or coupling constant .",
    "the collapse point @xmath7 , at which the collapse starts to occur , is equivalent to the free - fermion point of the thirring representation of the 2d coulomb gas @xcite ; although the free energy and the particle density diverge , the truncated ursell correlation functions are finite at this point . in a recent work @xcite , we have solved exactly the 2d problem of one colloid immersed in the coulomb gas just at the free - fermion point .",
    "an explicit form of the induced electric potential as a function of the bare colloidal charge was derived at every point of the space .",
    "based on this exact result , the concept of renormalized charge was shown to fail in this strong - coupling regime .",
    "on the other hand , the anticipated phenomenon of the electric potential saturation was confirmed at the free - fermion point .",
    "our present aim is to extend the exact treatment of the guest - charge(s ) problem to the whole coulomb - gas stability region of inverse temperatures @xmath8 . a first important step towards this aim",
    "has already been done by solving exactly the equilibrium statistical mechanics of the 2d coulomb gas in the stability regime ( the bulk thermodynamics , special cases of the surface thermodynamics and the large - distance behavior of the two - body correlation functions ) via an equivalence with the integrable 2d euclidean sine - gordon theory ; for a short review , see ref .",
    "@xcite . as is shown in this paper , the problem of one ( two ) guest charge(s ) immersed in the coulomb plasma",
    "is related to the evaluation of one - point ( two - point ) expectation values of the exponential field in the sine - gordon theory .",
    "based on recent progress in the latter topic , we derive explicit formulas for the chemical potential of one guest charge and for the asymptotic large - distance behavior of the effective interaction between two guest charges .",
    "the exact results imply , under some circumstances , an effective attraction ( repulsion ) between like - charged ( oppositely - charged ) guest particles and the charge inversion in the electrolyte around a highly - charged guest particle .",
    "the adequacy of the concept of renormalized charge is confirmed in the whole stability region @xmath8 .",
    "the related saturation phenomenon is revised .",

    "let us summarize briefly the crucial results of the present work .",
    "section 3 deals with the case of one point - like particle of charge @xmath45 ( with @xmath113 ) immersed in the bulk of the stable 2d coulomb gas .",
    "passing to the sine - gordon representation , we were able to relate in eq .",
    "( [ 3.3 ] ) the excess chemical potential @xmath44 of the guest charge to the expectation value of the exponential field",
    ". the explicit form of the latter quantity was conjectured by lukyanov and zamolodchikov @xcite , see eqs .",
    "( [ 3.4 ] ) and ( [ 3.5 ] ) , and subsequently verified by various methods .",
    "our coulomb - gas formulation provides two other checks of this conjecture : the guest - charge collapse test at @xmath114 and the predicted singular behavior ( [ 3.11 ] ) of the exponential - field expectation close to the collapse value of @xmath236 @xmath237 .",
    "the problem of two guest point - like particles , charged by @xmath135 and @xmath137 and being at distance @xmath110 from one another , is studied in section 4 . using the form - factor method for the two - point correlation functions in the sine - gordon formulation of the problem",
    ", we have derived the explicit formula ( [ 4.13 ] ) for the effective interaction energy of the two guest charges @xmath191 at asymptotically large distance @xmath40 .",
    "this formula is valid rigorously for @xmath238 ; in a subspace of this region of charge values we have noticed an anomalous weakening of the effective interaction when one of the guest charges is increasing . since in the definition ( [ 4.4 ] )",
    "of @xmath191 the divergences of chemical potentials ( caused by the collapse of guest charge with electrolyte counterions ) cancel with each other , we have suggested an extended validity of the formula ( [ 4.13 ] ) for arbitrary values of @xmath135 and @xmath137 ( the regularization hypothesis ) .",
    "then , under certain circumstances ( especially , the inequality @xmath239 must hold and one of the guest charges has to be large enough ) , the result ( [ 4.13 ] ) implies an effective attraction ( repulsion ) between like - charged ( oppositely - charged ) guest particles .",
    "the adequacy of the concept of renormalized charge was confirmed in section 5 .",
    "this is not a surprise : in the whole stability interval of inverse temperatures @xmath8 , the large - distance behavior of two - point correlators is determined by the form - factor of the same particle from the sine - gordon spectrum , namely the @xmath72-breather with the lightest mass @xmath179 playing the role of the inverse correlation length of electrolyte species .",

    "the previous results obtained at the free - fermion ( collapse ) point @xmath7 @xcite are different from the present ones concerning the stability interval @xmath8 in the following aspects .",
    "firstly , the concept of renormalized charge fails at @xmath7 .",
    "secondly , at @xmath7 , when the bare charge @xmath235 the induced electrostatic potential saturates _ monotonically _ at a finite value in each point of the electrolyte region .",
    "the reason for the fundamental differences is obvious .",
    "the lightest @xmath72-breather disappears from the particle spectrum of the sine - gordon model just at @xmath7 , and the asymptotic behavior of two - point correlation functions at this coupling constant is governed by the soliton - antisoliton pair . since @xmath241 as @xmath242 , the particle mass in the exponential decay is a continuous function of @xmath1 at @xmath7 . on the other side",
    ", the inverse - power - law asymptotic behavior , which is determined by the form - factor of the dominant particle(s ) in the sine - gordon spectrum , undertakes an abrupt modification when passing through the @xmath7 point .",
    "the basic qualitative features of the results obtained at the free - fermion point @xmath7 are expected to be present also for such @xmath243 where the soliton - antisoliton pair exists .",
    "it is known @xcite that the soliton - antisoliton pair disappears from the sine - gordon particle spectrum ( and the sine - gordon theory ceases to be massive ) at the point @xmath76 @xmath77 which corresponds to the kosterlitz - thouless transition of infinite order from the conducting ( fluid ) phase to the insulating phase .",
