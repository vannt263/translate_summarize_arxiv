    ", free - space optical ( fso ) communications have gained a significant attention due to their advantages of higher bandwidth in unlicensed spectrum and higher throughput compared to their rf counterparts @xcite .",
    "hence , the gathering of both fso and rf technologies arises as a promising solution for securing connectivity between the rf access network and the fiber - optic - based backbone network . as such",
    ", there has been prominent interest in mixed fso / rf systems where rf transmission is used at one hop and fso transmission at the other .",
    "most contributions within this research line consider restrictive irradiance and channel gain probability density function ( pdf ) models for the fso and rf links , respectively .",
    "the most commonly utilized models for the irradiance in fso links are the lognormal and the gamma - gamma @xcite-@xcite .",
    "recently , a new generalized statistical model , the mlaga-@xmath0 distribution , was proposed in @xcite to model the irradiance fluctuation of an unbounded optical wavefront ( plane or spherical waves ) propagating through a turbulent medium under all irradiance conditions in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence .",
    "the mlaga-@xmath0 distribution is a generalized distribution that unifies most statistical models proposed so far with its ability to better reflect a wider range of turbulence conditions @xcite . on the rf side ,",
    "previous works typically assume either rayleigh or nakagami-@xmath3 fading @xcite,@xcite , thereby lacking the flexibility to account for disparate signal propagation mechanisms as those characterized in 5 g communications which will accommodate a wide range of usage scenarios with diverse link requirements . to bridge this gap in the literature",
    ", the @xmath1-@xmath2 shadowed fading model , recently derived in @xcite , is an attractive proposition .",
    "in addition to presenting an excellent fit to the fading observed in a range of real - world applications ( e.g. device - to - device , and body - centric fading channels @xcite ) , the @xmath1-@xmath2 shadowed fading encompasses several rf channel models such as nakagami-@xmath3 , rayleigh , ricean , @xmath1-@xmath2 and shadowed rician fading distributions .",
    "this new channel fading model offers far better and much more flexible representations of practical fading los ( line of sight ) , nlos ( non - los ) , and shadowed channels than the rayleigh and nakagami - m distributions .",
    "this letter presents a unified mathematical framework to study the ergodic capacity of mixed fso / rf amplify and forward ( af ) relay systems operating over mlaga-@xmath0 and @xmath1-@xmath2 shadowed fading channels . the paper further accounts for pointing errors on the fso link , while considering two detection techniques : heterodyne and intensity modulation / direct detection ( im / dd ) @xcite .",
    "we consider a relay - assisted mixed fso / rf transmission composed of both mlaga-@xmath0 with pointing errors and @xmath1-@xmath2 shadowed fading environments .",
    "the source communicates with the destination through an intermediate relay , able to activate both heterodyne and im / dd detection techniques at the reception of the optical beam .",
