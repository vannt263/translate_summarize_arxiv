    "the schrdinger - newton equation ( sne ) was proposed in the context of quantum foundations @xcite . assuming a newtonian self - interaction , it realizes the concept that gravity is responsible for the observed spatial localization of macroscopic objects .",
    "it leads to plausible scales of localization .",
    "the sne has been studied in numerous works @xcite .",
    "its basic feature is that the newtonian mean - field self - interaction modifies the free schrdinger equation in such a way that it acquires localized ground states ( solitons ) .",
    "these solutions are then considered as natural ` pointer ' states for the macroscopic objects . on the other hand ,",
    "these stationary pointer states are expected to emerge through the evolution of the wave function .",
    "unfortunately , this irreversible mechanism can not be realized by the reversible sne .",
    "to make the solutions converge toward pointer states , one gives the newton coupling @xmath1 a negative imaginary part .",
    "it turns the reversible sne into an irreversible frictional sne ( frsne ) .",
    "the specific frsne with @xmath2 has been an emergent structure in the author s decoherence model @xcite , and its relationship to the reversible sne has been analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we recall the one - body frsne in sec .",
    "[ one ] , we solve it numerically and determine the unique stationary wave packet in sec .  [ num ] .",
    "we discuss the two - body frsne in the special case when the bodies are far form each other and find that the imaginary coupling induces gravitational attraction , as if it were real coupling ( sec .",
    "[ two ] ) .",
    "the strength of this induced gravity , however , turns out to depend on the quantum state of the participating bodies . the general case of complex coupling @xmath3 with @xmath4",
    "is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ complex ] .",
    "the sne is a schrdinger equation with a newtonian mean - field potential where - in contrast to textbook many - body equations - we retain the self - interaction terms .",
    "therefore the mean - field potential is already present in the one - body sne : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the c.o.m .",
    "wave function of the object of mass @xmath7 , @xmath1 is the newton constant , and @xmath8 is the newtonian mean - field potential of a point - like object .",
    "the stationary ground states are solitons of spread @xmath9 @xcite but they do not attract other solutions . we create a basin of attraction ( convergence ) if we give @xmath1 an imaginary part .",
    "robust convergence is achieved by the replacement @xmath2 : @xmath10 the imaginary mean - field corrupts the normalization of @xmath11 , we restore it by the constant counter term : @xmath12 the frsne preserves both the momentum and the position expectation values @xmath13 and @xmath14 . if , for simplicity , we start a wave function with @xmath15 and @xmath16 then the solution will converge to the rotational invariant stationary state @xmath17 where @xmath18 surprisingly , the ` energy ' @xmath19 of the stationary state ( [ stac_sol_spher ] ) contains the kinetic energy only , without the contribution of the newton self - interaction .",
    "this is a consequence of the choice @xmath2 which makes the mean - field pure imaginary , there is no real dynamical potential left in the frsne .",
    "little is known about the details of the stationary solution ( [ stac_sol_spher ] ) .",
    "dimensional analysis of the standard spread yields the same order of magnitude @xmath9 as in case of the reversible sne @xcite .",
    "analytic results exist for large extended spherical objects @xcite ; for point - like bodies we have to use numeric simulations . once we know the stationary solution @xmath20 in the c.o.m",
    "frame then , thanks to the galilean invariance of the frsne , we know all stationary solutions : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 while @xmath24 . if the frsne is perturbed by a weak smoothly varying field , real or imaginary , we can still retain the above form if we make the c.o.m .",
    "momentum @xmath25 time - dependent .",
    "this will be the case later when we apply the frsne to two bodies far from each other .",
    "the following position - momentum correlation matrix will play a definitive role in their effective interaction : @xmath26 due to the rotational invariance of @xmath20 , the stationary matrix @xmath27 becomes proportional to the unit matrix @xmath28 , i.e. : @xmath29 .",
    "the correlation scalar @xmath30 will be determined numerically .",
    "we restricted our numeric simulations for rotational invariant states @xmath31 .",
    "the mean - field ( [ pot ] ) takes the following form : @xmath32 the frsne ( [ frsne ] ) reduces to : @xmath33 we have simulated the solution of this equation with various initial wave functions ( gaussian , smoothened rectangle , superposition of two gaussians ) .",
    "they all converged to the unique localized stationary solution ( [ stac_sol_spher ] ) .",
    "we illustrate the convergence process by monitoring the time - dependence of the standard spread @xmath34 of the wave function : @xmath35 a competition between the spreading kinetic term and the contractive potential term is witnessed by transient oscillations until the stationary value @xmath36 is reached ( fig .  [ fig : dev ] ) .    the fig .",
    "[ fig : abs2 ] shows the stationary distribution @xmath37 .",
    "it is bell - shaped but it is not gaussian .",
    "also the complex phase of the numeric solution @xmath38 is shown in the same figure .",
    "we numerically observed the constant shift of the phase at speed @xmath39 , with @xmath40 .",
    "this value has independently been confirmed by numeric integration of the expression ( [ e_stac ] ) using the numerically calculated @xmath20 .",
    "we also determine the stationary position - momentum correlation matrix ( [ r ] ) in the numerically obtained stationary state @xmath20 . the correlation scalar @xmath30 can be written as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "numeric integration obtained @xmath43 .",
    "for two identical objects the wave function reads @xmath44 and the frsne has the following structure @xcite : @xmath45 where the laplacians @xmath46 refer to @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the mean - field self - interactions read : @xmath48 the mean - field cross - interactions read : @xmath49    we do not intend to discuss the generic two - body solutions .",
    "we are interested in the special case when the two bodies are far from each other at locations @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath52 is much larger than the one - body stationary extension @xmath53 then we expect the following scenario .",
    "considering first the limit @xmath54 , the cross - interactions @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be omitted , the two - body frsne ( [ frsne2 ] ) splits into two separate one - body equations ( [ frsne ] ) : both bodies reach their localized stationary states in their respective c.o.m .",
    "frames . accordingly , the two - body solution is simply the product @xmath57 of the one - body solutions ( [ stac_sol ] ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and a similar definition holds for @xmath61 , too .",
    "as we said , the effect of the cross - interaction terms @xmath62 is perturbative and leads to the slight acceleration of the c.o.m .",
    "momenta @xmath63 .",
    "let us calculate the acceleration of @xmath64 .",
    "first , we expand the cross - interaction term",
    "@xmath55 : @xmath65 where : @xmath66 if we substitute the ansatz ( [ psi_stac2 ] ) into the two - body frsne ( [ frsne2 ] ) , the following separate structure can be obtained for @xmath67 : @xmath68 this is an effective frsne , valid for @xmath69 , to calculate the c.o.m .",
    "acceleration @xmath70 of the stationary wave packet of the body .",
    "the vector @xmath71 is the newton force at location @xmath50 caused by the other body at the remote location @xmath51 , and @xmath72 is the force on the second body caused by the first one . a similar equation could be derived for @xmath73 , with the opposite force @xmath72 .",
    "however , the vector @xmath71 _ does not play the role of a real force _ in the eq .",
    "( [ frsne1 ] ) .",
    "if it did , it should have come with the additional imaginary factor @xmath74 .",
    "nevertheless , we are going to prove that even these imaginary newton forces can mimic the true newton forces .",
    "indeed , they do accelerate the bodies in a newtonian way apart from a numeric factor @xmath30 .",
    "the acceleration @xmath70 has the standard form : @xmath75^\\ast\\nabla_1\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}\\psi_0^{(1)}({\\mathbf{r}}_1)}{{\\mathrm{d}}t}{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathbf{r}}_1                                 -i\\hbar\\int\\left[\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}\\psi_0^{(1)}({\\mathbf{r}}_1)}{{\\mathrm{d}}t}\\right]^\\ast\\nabla_1\\psi_0^{(1)}({\\mathbf{r}}_1){\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathbf{r}}_1~.\\ ] ] let us substitute the effective equation ( [ frsne1 ] ) and recall the matrix @xmath27 for the position - momentum correlation ( [ r ] ) in the stationary state @xmath20 .",
    "after trivial steps we get @xmath76 which , due to the rotational symmetry , amounts to the ultimate form : @xmath77 and , of course , similar steps would give the opposite acceleration @xmath78 for the other body .",
    "the value of @xmath30 was obtained numerically in sec .",
    "we outline some features of the general frsne - first advocated in the present letter - where the coupling @xmath1 in the sne is replaced by @xmath3 .",
    "obviously , @xmath79 means the reversible sne ( [ sne ] ) , @xmath80 is the case @xmath2 known earlier @xcite and studied through secs .",
    "[ one]-[two ] while @xmath81 would mean the reversible sne with repulsive newton gravity which we exclude from considerations . inside the region",
    "@xmath4 we have generalized frsnes with features resembling the investigated special case @xmath80 .",
    "all these frsnes have localized one - body asymptotic states of unique shape with parameters of the same order of magnitude .",
    "convergence was numerically observed already at small imaginary couplings .",
    "( we conjecture that the ground state solution of the sne is exactly indetical with the stationary state @xmath20 of the frsne with coupling @xmath82 , where @xmath83 . ) for @xmath80 one has a fairly robust convergence which becomes finally lost towards the edges @xmath84 . for a general frsne",
    ", the strength of newton attraction has two contributions : the true dynamics which is proportional to @xmath85 and the induced acceleration which is proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "the resulting gravity is characterized by an effective coupling : @xmath87 on fig .",
    "[ fig : geff ] , we have plotted the factor @xmath88 in function of the phase @xmath89 .",
    "we see that the effective newton forces are bigger than the standard ones by a small numeric factor about , apparently , less than @xmath90 .",
    "we could renormalize the bare coupling @xmath1 by the inverse of this factor in order to get the right effective coupling .",
    "this discussion is beyond our scope now , yet we mention a very similar issue with an alternative - and perhaps related - concept of emergent ( induced ) gravity @xcite .",
    "we have studied the simplest frictional schrdinger - newton equation characterized by the pure imaginary coupling @xmath91 .",
    "we solved the one - body frsne numerically and found robust convergence to a unique localized wave packet in the c.o.m . frame . in case of the two - body frsne",
    "we discussed a heuristic solution in the special case when the two bodies are far from each other .",
    "they quickly form stationary wave packets in their respective c.o.m",
    "an effective attraction emerges between them which is @xmath92 times the newtonian attraction where @xmath30 is the position - momentum correlation of the one - body stationary wave packet .",
    "therefore our ` induced gravity ' depends on the details of the wave function of the participating bodies .",
    "before they reach their stationary states towards the limit @xmath93 , the emergent gravity may be very different from newton s .",
    "as to the stationary regime itself , an immediate question arises : can we tune the factor @xmath30 to @xmath94 ?",
    "yes , we can .",
    "the frsne of extended spherical bodies yields just @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "therefore it may well be that the concept of the frsne with pure imaginary coupling @xmath91 contains a bit of real physics : for large extended objects the frsne would show stable convergence to one - body localized states and induces correct newton forces between the distant objects .",
    "yet , we would not like to over - interprete this theory since any sne in itself faces serious interpretational problems , like any other non - linear deterministic schrdinger equation @xcite . finally , we discussed a novel class of frsne with general complex coupling .",
    "our simulations show that for point - like objects the effective ( real + induced ) gravity is bigger than newton s by a small factor .    in both our conceptional and numerical analysis we followed restricted aims . without sinking into the interpretational context ( wave function collapse , macroscopic quantum mechanics , quantum gravity , etc . )",
    "we wanted to point out the hitherto unknown mechanism of gravity induced by the imaginary mean - field .",
    "our numeric simulations served this aim basically , we have not targeted a systematic numeric study of the frsne .",
    "we add , nonetheless , the irreversible frsne is an easy subject of simulation , compared to the irreversible sne , its numeric study might be an attractive further task in itself while , more importantly , it would serve our conceptional understanding a possible role of the frsne in foundations .",
