    "the operation of icecube detector @xcite and the r&d effort of km3net @xcite are important progresses toward a km@xmath7-sized detection capability in the neutrino astronomy @xcite .",
    "furthermore the radio and air - shower detectors , such as anita @xcite and pierre auger detector @xcite respectively , are also taking the data .",
    "these detectors are sensitive to neutrinos with energies higher than those probed by icecube and km3net . finally , the radio extension of icecube detector , the iceray @xcite , is also under consideration .",
    "it is expected to detect a score of cosmogenic neutrinos @xcite per year .",
    "motivated by the development of neutrino telescopes , numerous efforts were devoted to studying neutrino mixing parameters with astrophysical neutrinos as the beam source @xcite . due to the large neutrino propagation distance",
    ", the neutrino oscillation probabilities only depend on the mixing angles @xmath0 and the cp phase @xmath8 @xcite , which make the astrophysical beam source favorable for extracting the above parameters , provided there are sufficient number of events .",
    "most of the astrophysical neutrinos are believed to be produced by the decay of charged pion through the following chain : @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "this leads to the neutrino flux ratio @xmath11 at the astrophysical source where @xmath12 is the sum of @xmath13 and @xmath14 flux .",
    "such a flux ratio results from an implicit assumption that the muon decays into neutrinos before it loses a significant fraction of its energy .",
    "however , in some source the muon quickly loses its energy by interacting with strong magnetic fields or with matter @xcite .",
    "such a muon eventually decays into neutrinos with energies much lower than that of @xmath15 from @xmath16 decays .",
    "consequently this type of source has a neutrino flavor ratio @xmath17 , which is referred to as the muon - damped source .",
    "the third type of source emits neutrons resulting from the photo - disassociation of nuclei .",
    "as neutrons propagate to the earth , @xmath18 are produced from neutron @xmath19 decays @xcite , leading to a neutrino flavor ratio @xmath20 .",
    "finally , neutrinos might be produced deep inside optically thick sources so that the flavor ratio at the source surface is significantly different from the flavor ratio at the production point due to the oscillations @xcite",
    ". hence , unlike the previous three cases , the @xmath21 fraction can be significant at the surface of such sources . in the class of sources studied by mena _",
    "_ @xcite , which are referred to as the astrophysical hidden sources , the neutrino flux ratio for @xmath22 gev approaches to @xmath23 with both @xmath24 and @xmath25 oscillating with the neutrino energy under the constraint @xmath26 .    as mentioned before , almost all previous studies treat astrophysical neutrinos as the beam source for extracting neutrino mixing parameters @xcite . to have a better determination of certain neutrino mixing parameter , for instance the atmospheric mixing angle @xmath27 or the cp phase @xmath8 , a combined analysis on the terrestrially measured flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos coming from different sources , such as the pion source and the muon - damped source , has been considered @xcite .",
    "a natural question to ask is then how well one can distinguish these neutrino sources .",
    "the answer to this question depends on our knowledge of neutrino mixing parameters and the achievable accuracies in measuring the neutrino flavor ratios on the earth such as @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this article",
    ", we shall provide an answer to this question with a statistical analysis .",
    "the possibility of measuring neutrino flavor fraction by icecube has been discussed in ref .",
    "it is through the measurement of muon track to shower ratio .",
    "it was demonstrated that the @xmath30 fraction can be extracted from the above ratio by assuming flavor independence of the neutrino spectrum and the @xmath31 symmetry , i.e. , @xmath32 .",
    "taking a pion source with @xmath33 gev @xmath34s@xmath35 @xcite and thresholds for muon and shower energies taken to be @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 tev respectively , the @xmath30 fraction can be determined to an accuracy of @xmath38 at icecube for one year of data taking , or equivalently to an accuracy of @xmath39 for a decade of data taking . however , the tau neutrino events are too rare to provide additional information on the neutrino flavor composition .",
    "the analysis in ref .  @xcite as summarized above provides a feasibility of measuring @xmath5 in a good precision at icecube and detectors with comparable capacities .",
    "in fact one may repeat the analysis in @xcite and extract @xmath5 and its associated uncertainty directly . the uncertainty in @xmath5",
    "is expected to be comparable to that of @xmath30 fraction .",
    "we note that the precisions on measuring @xmath5 and @xmath6 should depend on neutrino energies .",
    "however , for simplicity in discussions , we shall take @xmath5 and @xmath6 as ratios of integrated neutrino flux with appropriate energy thresholds for suppressing the atmospheric neutrino background . these ratios and the corresponding precisions , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ,",
    "are therefore energy independent . in our analysis",
    ", we do not assume @xmath31 symmetry for the neutrino flux measured on the earth .",
    "we shall argue that , besides measuring @xmath5 , it is essential to measure @xmath6 in order to reconstruct the neutrino flavor ratio at the astrophysical source .",
    "this implies that a neutrino telescope beyond the capability of icecube is needed to study the neutrino flavor astronomy .",
    "it is important to understand the atmospheric neutrino background which affects the precisions on measuring @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the flux spectrum of conventional atmospheric neutrinos which arise from pion and kaon decays is well understood @xcite .",
    "the measurement on such a spectrum @xcite has reached to the energy of @xmath42 gev . the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux arising from charm decays still contains large uncertainties @xcite and it has not yet been measured experimentally .",
    "the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux takes over the conventional one around @xmath42 gev for @xmath30 and @xmath43 gev for @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the flavor ratio of conventional atmospheric neutrino beyond tev energies is approximately @xmath45 ; while the flavor ratio of prompt atmospheric neutrino flux is approximately @xmath46 .",
    "such flavor ratios differ significantly from those of astrophysical neutrinos which arrive on earth with @xmath47 .",
    "to suppress atmospheric neutrino background in the search of astrophysical neutrinos , energy distributions of astrophysical neutrino events and cuts on pmt hits are imposed @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss properties of the probability matrix that links the initial neutrino flavor ratio to the ratio measured on the earth . in sec .",
    "iii , we begin with a brief review on the current understanding of neutrino mixing angles .",
    "we then present the reconstructed neutrino flavor ratio at the source from the simulated data , which is generated by the chosen true values of the neutrino flavor ratio at the source and best - fit values of neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "the statistical analysis is performed with different measurement accuracies in @xmath5 and @xmath6 , as well as different ranges of neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "the implications of our results are discussed in sec .",
    "the neutrino flux at the astrophysical source and that detected on the earth are related by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the neutrino flux measured on the earth while @xmath12 is the neutrino flux at the astrophysical source , and the matrix element @xmath50 is the probability of the oscillation @xmath51 .",
    "the exact analytic expressions for @xmath50 are given in eq .",
    "( [ exact_prob ] ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the limit @xmath54 , i.e. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in this case , the probability matrix @xmath57 is singular with a vanishing determinant . in general , the determinant of this matrix remains suppressed since both @xmath58 and @xmath59 are expected to be small . for @xmath54 , the eigenvectors of @xmath57 are given by @xmath60 with the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , those initial flavor ratios that differ from one another by a multiple of @xmath63 shall oscillate into the same flavor ratio on the earth . to illustrate this explicitly ,",
    "we write the initial flux @xmath64 at the astrophysical source as @xmath65 where we have imposed the normalization condition @xmath66 .",
    "this normalization convention will be adopted throughout this paper . the first term on the right - hand side ( rhs ) of eq .",
    "( [ initial ] ) can be expressed as @xmath67 .",
    "hence the neutrino flux measured by the terrestrial neutrino telescope is @xmath68 it is seen that the vector @xmath63 , with a coefficient proportional to @xmath69 , does not appear in the terrestrially measured flux @xmath70 .",
    "hence the terrestrial measurement can not constrain @xmath69 in this case .",
    "the above degeneracy is lifted by either a non - vanishing @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) or a deviation of @xmath27 from @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) . to simplify our discussions ,",
    "let us take @xmath75 and @xmath74 .",

    "both @xmath175 and @xmath177 should be of the order @xmath176 or smaller .",
    "we have also performed a statistical analysis with the errors of @xmath27 and @xmath189 both reduced and the limit of @xmath71 improved to @xmath190 ( i.e. , @xmath191 ) .",
    "the result of this analysis can be best described by the modification to the left panel of fig .",
    "[ pi1 ] . with @xmath190 ,",
    "it is possible to rule out the muon - damped source at the @xmath133 level for an input pion source by reducing the errors of both @xmath27 and @xmath189 to @xmath192 of their original values .",
    "we like to point out that our analysis has been based upon the ideal scenario that the true astrophysical neutrino source is either a pure pion source or a pure muon - damped source . in practice ,",
    "the neutrino flavor ratio in a single astrophysical source can depend on neutrino energies such that it behaves like the one from a pion source at the low energy and gradually makes a transition to the one from a muon - damped source as the neutrino energy increases @xcite .",
    "hence the reconstruction of the source flavor ratio ought to be carried out separately for low and high energy portions of the data .",
    "furthermore an analysis on the diffuse neutrino flux is challenging since such a flux arises from astrophysical sources with different neutrino flavor ratios . nevertheless , the very high energy part of the flux spectrum is possibly dominated by the cosmogenic neutrino flux @xcite arising from gzk @xcite interactions .",
    "the cosmogenic neutrino flux is a typical example of neutrino fluxes due to the pion source .",
    "therefore it is sensible to reconstruct the source flavor ratio with respect to the highest energy part of the diffuse neutrino spectrum , provided there are sufficient number of events .",
    "the accuracy @xmath141 ( @xmath193 ) frequently used in our discussions requires @xmath194 neutrino events for each flavor .",
    "furthermore , the above accuracy requires an improved understanding on the background atmospheric neutrino flux to a level better than @xmath3 in the future .",
    "taking a neutrino flux upper bound @xmath195 gev @xmath34s@xmath35 ( @xmath196 ) derived by waxman and bahcall @xcite , we estimate by a simple re - scaling of the result in ref .  @xcite that it takes the icecube detector about a decade to accumulate @xmath194 @xmath44 events .",
    "we stress that the above bound is for diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "the flux from individual point source is smaller .",
    "hence it takes even a longer period to accumulate the same number of events .",
    "the iceray @xcite detector is expected to accumulate neutrino events in a much faster pace .",
    "however the efficiency of flavor identification in this detector still requires further studies .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that it is challenging to reconstruct the neutrino flavor ratio at the astrophysical source , requiring a lot more than a decade of data taking in a neutrino telescope such as icecube for distinguishing between the pion source and the muon - damped source .",
    "we stress that the large uncertainty in the flavor ratios of astrophysical neutrinos should be taken into account as one uses these neutrinos as a beam source to extract the neutrino mixing parameters .    _ note added . _",
    "as we were writing up this paper , we became aware of a paper by a. esmaili and y. farzan , arxiv:0905.0259 [ hep - ph ] , which also discusses the initial flavor composition of cosmic neutrinos with an approach different from ours .",
