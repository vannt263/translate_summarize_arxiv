    "in view of the rapid development of the experimental realization of quantum information processing ( qip ) by using different physical systems , it is an urgent obligation to find a proper strategy for detection of entanglement .",
    "one of the most commonly used systems in the study of physical realizations of qip is an ensemble system and the best - known technology therein is nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite .",
    "the ensemble system of nmr has been employed for implementation of even relatively complicated quantum algorithms @xcite . however , nmr has been facing difficulty with regard to the existence of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the complication actually arises because of somewhat confusing ensemble behavior of the nmr system .",
    "the confusion manifests itself when macroscopic quantities , such as results of nmr measurement involving an average over a large number of molecules , are used to detect microscopic properties , such as entanglement between pairs of nuclear spins inside each molecule .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that , for some particular case of nmr implementation of quantum nonlocal algorithms , the apparent nonlocal behavior of the highly mixed states in nmr is due to a large number of molecules involved in the ensemble system @xcite .",
    "hence , highly mixed states of nmr are separable and can not be used for immaculate implementation of quantum nonlocal algorithms for which entanglement is believed to play an essential prerequisite role @xcite .    on the other hand , ensemble quantum computing",
    "( qc ) pertains some inevitable advantages .",
    "it is particularly workable since spin manipulation is performed easily by applying corresponding pulses .",
    "in addition , ensemble qc , such as nmr , is supported by a long term research in the area of spectroscopy .",
    "thus , it would be unfair and also inefficient to totally ignore ensemble qc .",
    "we have been involved in realization of qip by means of electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopy ( endor ) @xcite .",
    "although this system should be taken as an ensemble system at the moment , it has been profoundly evaluated for more elaborated nonlocal qip through experimental studies @xcite .",
    "however , after applying entangling operations in an experiment , it might still be premature to claim that the state is properly entangled enough for implementation of nonlocal qip .",
    "at least some qualitative detection of general multipartite entanglement for a particular system of interest should be examined in advance .",
    "detection of a general multipartite entanglement is one of the most challenging problems for an experimental study in qip .",
    "there are several approaches in this context .",
    "one may first employ a full state tomography with which the complete density matrix would be obtained .",
    "then , direct application of an existing entanglement measure would be evaluated on the quantum state in order to extract information about the entanglement of the state .",
    "this is , however , a bit too general to be efficient .",
    "the density matrix of the quantum state includes far more information than necessary for an entanglement estimation only .",
    "furthermore , it is difficult to find a sufficient condition of entanglement for a given state in general if the dimension of the state is neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 for which the peres - horodecki criterion @xcite would be applicable .",
    "detection of entanglement of a quantum state through violation of the bell inequalities also should not be taken to be perfect since there are entangled states that do not violate any known bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "still one may try the existing approaches that work for a state that is totally unknown in advance @xcite .",
    "however , this may not be the most proper choice for our system of interest since as long as we are working in an experiment , we have definitely some knowledge about the state , i.e. , through the prepared initial state or applied operations .",
    "if this is the case , it would be more appropriate to define an entanglement detector measure that is easily workable with less experimental effort by taking advantage of the available information on the state .",
    "we have studied the concept of entanglement witness ( ew ) @xcite with the motivation to introduce an entanglement detection applicable for a particular system of interest .",
    "the ew is an observable which has non - negative expectation values for all separable states .",
    "therefore , detection of a negative value indicates the entanglement of the state .",
    "in addition to the very fast development in the theory of ews for different classes of states @xcite , in experiments also detection of entanglement by the use of witness operators has attracted special attention @xcite . for physical systems in thermodynamical limits , witness operators",
    "are developed @xcite .",
    "in addition , ews are generated for detecting entanglement of mixed states that are close to a given pure state @xcite .",
    "ews are used for characterizing different classes of a multipartite quantum state @xcite .",
    "after determination of the ew for a particular expected state in an experiment , the important task is to decompose it into local operators that are easily measurable in the given physical system .",
    "this approach for detection of entanglement is operationally possible and , for most cases , is a simple method @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite detection of multipartite entanglement with few local measurements is studied . throughout the study on this issue , it has been more appreciated to operationally simplify the entanglement detection process by modifying the required observables for the particular working system and/or decreasing the number of local measurements .    generally speaking ,",
    "previously introduced methods for detection of entanglement by the use of ews require several projective measurements on the copies of a state in order to extract the outcome .",
    "however , it is somehow operationally difficult to prepare several copies of a quantum state to be measured for detection of entanglement .",
    "therefore , it is more advantageous if an ew works just with a single run experiment .",
    "also , the detection process would be better to be specially modified for the particular working system .",
    "for instance , if the physical system of interest is an ensemble system , then the available measurements are ensemble average measurements .",
    "we work with ensemble systems .",
    "therefore , ensemble average measurements should be employed here , in contrast with the projective measurements widely used in the previous works .",
    "therefore , in this work , we propose a proper single - experiment - detectable ( sed ) ew for the ensemble system qc .",
    "the most significant result of our work is that our schemes require only a single - run experiment to detect entanglement by using nondestructive ensemble average measurements , which allow us to measure several non - commuting operators simultaneously .",
    "a well known example of nondestructive measurement is the free induction decay measurement that is frequently used in nmr quantum computing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first in the following section we will briefly summarize the concept of the ew and will give a short review particularly for multipartite ews .",
    "then , in the third section we will introduce and prove a method with which the conventional ew can be transformed into a collection of separate but simultaneous measurements of individual local systems of the ensemble qc .",
    "the analysis of this section is based on the assumption that the density matrix is diagonal after application of the disentangling operations introduced there . in the subsequent section , a different sed ew , which works without any assumption on the density matrix ,",
    "is introduced . as a drawback",
    ", however , we have to introduce an ancillary qubit . in sec .",
    "[ five ] we will extend discussions on our scheme , study the complexity of the corresponding quantum circuits for sed ew , and give some remarks on the behavior of this scheme under generally existing noise in the system .",
    "a density matrix @xmath2 is entangled if and only if there exists a hermitian operator @xmath3 , called an entanglement witness ( ew ) , such that @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the set of separable states @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is concluded that a state is entangled if some negative value is obtained in measurement of an ew .",
    "there are several methods to construct an ew @xcite . for the case",
    "in which a density matrix has a negative eigenvalue when partially transposed , the construction of the ew is very simple .",
    "the partially transposed projector onto the eigenvector corresponding to the negative eigenvalue of the partial transpose of the state is an ew @xcite .    one important and notable point about ews appears when dealing with the multipartite case .",
    "ews can be used to detect different kinds of multipartite entanglement by defining the space @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ define ] ) to be the set of states that does not have a special kind of entanglement to be detected @xcite .",
    "let us give an example . while all the entanglements for two qubits are actually equivalent to each other , for three qubits there are two classes of genuine pure tripartite entangled states @xcite .",
    "the entangled states from different classes can not be transformed into each other by local operations and classical communications ( locc ) .",
    "one class is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) class that includes entangled states locc - equivalent to @xcite @xmath6 this classification can be extended to more general tripartite mixed states .",
    "we remind the reader that a tripartite ( and generally any multipartite ) state @xmath2 is separable if it can be written as a convex combination of fully separable states .",
    "however , a state @xmath2 may not be fully separable but biseparable , i.e. , it can be written as a convex combination of biseparable pure states . if a tripartite state @xmath2 is neither fully separable nor biseparable then it is entangled , in either the ghz class or the w class @xcite . corresponding to each class of entangled states ,",
    "there are ews already known .",
    "needless to say , these entanglement witnesses are not sufficient to decide if the system possesses a genuine multipartite entanglement .",
    "for instance , for the ghz state , the ew is @xmath7 while for the w state , it is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the identity operator @xcite .",
    "the ew that detects a genuine tripartite entanglement of a pure state @xmath10 , and of states close to @xmath10 , is given by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes the set of biseparable states .",
    "then @xmath14 for all biseparable states @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the coefficient @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ alpha ] ) is determined by using the schmidt decomposition @xcite .    for an ensemble system",
    ", it is desirable to find an observable that can be performed by a small number of experiments to satisfy operational requirements .",
    "any ew that is defined for the state @xmath18 , which is the most expected state after the applied operations and is close to the experimentally realized state @xmath2 , should be decomposed into a linear combination of individual polarization operators , in order to make it locally measurable . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new method with which an ew for multipartite states can be measured just with a single - run experiment .",
    "for starting up an experiment , the state is supposed to be initialized to a simple fiducial state , such as @xmath19 , for an @xmath20-qubit system . from now on we will drop the subscripts @xmath21 to simplify notation , unless otherwise stated .",
    "however , in an ensemble qc , the initial state is prepared in the form of a pseudopure state as follows @xmath22 where @xmath23 characterizes the fraction of the state @xmath18 .",
    "it is important to note here that the confusion regarding the concept of entanglement in an ensemble system is intrinsically apart from the concept of pseudopure state as an initial state .",
    "a pseudopure state is used for making the required input state for qc .",
    "improvement of experimental conditions above some definite threshold is required to realize an entangled state experimentally .",
    "in other words , the pseudopure state still can be used for realization of a genuine entangled state if the experimentally required conditions are all satisfied . here",
    ", we do not enter into the discussion of the very large required number of steps for making a pseudopure state as we suppose that , anyhow , we are given some prepared input state for which the status of entanglement should be studied .    in order to produce a particular entangled state ,",
    "the corresponding entangling operation @xmath24 is applied on a state @xmath18 to yield @xmath25 the corresponding pseudopure state is @xmath26 note that , even though the entangling operation @xmath24 is applied , @xmath27 may or may not be entangled , and our task is to detect entanglement of @xmath27 in order to examine whether @xmath27 is applicable for some quantum nonlocal algorithm , for example .",
    "the corresponding conventional ew , eq .",
    "( [ ew ] ) , for @xmath28 is @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is determined properly so that we do not get a negative value for separable states @xcite . the entanglement witness @xmath31 detects @xmath27 as entangled if @xmath32 where @xmath33 for instance , if a state @xmath34 is the experimentally achieved pseudopure state for the state @xmath35 eq .",
    "( [ ghz ] ) , then @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",
    "this large value of @xmath23 is in accordance with the results of studies on entanglement of pseudopure states which are indeed mixed states @xcite .",
    "one may still work with entanglement for an ensemble system without being engaged in the concept of a pseudopure state @xcite .",
    "however , if the state should be used for a quantum computation it is a formidable task to prepare a pseudopure state that works exactly as a pure state under unitary operations for qc .    generally speaking ,",
    "the expectation value of the observable @xmath31 is given after several measurements on copies of state @xmath27 . if @xmath38 then @xmath27 is entangled . in this work ,",
    "we introduce a strategy with which the ew can be detected in a single run - measurement .",
    "the most usual and convenient measurement in an ensemble qip is the spin magnetization @xmath39 of the @xmath40th spin .",

    "as illustrated in the figure , positive values are returned in the range of @xmath191 in which the noise - free entanglement witness ( i.e. , the case of @xmath193 ) returns negative values .",
    "a sed ew is more fragile against noise than a conventional one in the sense that the range of @xmath192 in which negative values are returned is small .",
    "nevertheless , it is important that we never obtain a negative value for a separable state even under noise in this example . for a general case ,",
    "a mathematical proof for returning non - negative values for all separable states is not easy because it is strongly dependent on the structure of the quantum circuit that has been used for the scheme introduced in this paper .",
