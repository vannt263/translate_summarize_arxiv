    ", a charged particle following toward a black hole emits radiation of the corresponding field .",
    "thus , a scalar particle falling into a black hole emits scalar waves .",
    "this collision process is interesting from the point of view of the dynamics itself in relation to the possibility of manufacturing black holes at lhc within the brane world scenario @xcite , and from the point of view of the ads / cft conjecture , since the scalar field can represent the string theory dilaton , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath2 ( besides @xmath8 ) are dimensions of interest for the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "in addition , one can compare this process with previous works , since there are results for the quasinormal modes of scalar , and electromagnetic perturbations which are known to govern the decay of the perturbations , at intermediate and late times @xcite .",
    "ads spacetime is the background spacetime in supersymmetric theories of gravity such as 11-dimensional supergravity and m - theory ( or string theory ) .",
    "the dimension @xmath0 of ads",
    "spacetime is treated as a parameter which , in principle , can have values from two to eleven in accord to these theories , and where the other spare dimensions either receive a kaluza - klein treatment or are joined as a compact manifold @xmath9 into the whole spacetime to yield @xmath10 . by taking a low energy limits at strong coupling and by performing a group theoretic analysis",
    ", maldacena has conjecture a correspondence between the bulk of @xmath0-dimenisonal ads spacetime in string theory and a dual conformal field gauge theory ( cft ) on the spacetime boundary @xcite .",
    "the first system to be studied with care was a d-3brane , in which case the conjecture states that type iib superstring theory in @xmath11 is the same as @xmath12@xmath13 @xmath14 super - yang - mills ( conformal ) theory on @xmath15 , with @xmath12 being the number of fermionic generators and @xmath16 the number of d - branes . a concrete method to implement this identification",
    "was given @xcite , where it was proposed to identify the extremum of the classical string theory action @xmath17 for the dilaton field @xmath18 , say , at the boundary of ads , with the generating functional @xmath19 of the green s correlation functions in the cft for the operator @xmath20 that corresponds to @xmath18 ( in the d-3brane case @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the gauge field strength ) , @xmath23\\ , ,   \\label{implement}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the value of @xmath18 at the ads boundary and the @xmath25 label the coordinates of the boundary .",
    "the motivation for this proposal stems from the common substratum of the two ads / cft descriptions , i.e. , supergravity theory in the ( asymptotically ) flat portion of the full black solutions .",
    "then , a perturbation in this flat portion disturbs in a similar fashion , both the ( soft ) boundary in one description and the cft on the brane world - volume in the other description @xcite . for systems other than the d-3brane , analogous statements for the correspondence ads@xmath26/cft@xmath27 follow ( see the review @xcite ) . in its strongest form",
    "the conjecture only requires that the spacetime be asymptotically ads , the interior could be full of gravitons or containing a black hole .",
    "the correspondence is indeed a strong / weak duality , and can in principle be used to study issues of gravity at very strong coupling ( such as , singularities , the localization of the black hole degrees of freedom and the relation with its entropy , the information paradox , and other problems ) using the associated gauge theory , or cft issues such as the difficult to calculate but important n - point correlation functions using classical gravity in the bulk .",
    "in addition , the ads / cft correspondence realizes the holographic principle @xcite , since the bulk is effectively encoded in the boundary .",
    "some general comments can be made about the mapping ads / cft when it envolves a black hole .",
    "a black hole in the bulk corresponds to a thermal state in the gauge theory @xcite .",
    "perturbing the black hole corresponds to perturbing the thermal state and the decaying of the perturbation is equivalent to the return to the thermal state .",
    "so one obtains a prediction for the thermal time scale in the strongly coupled cft .",
    "particles initially far from the black hole correspond to a blob ( a localized excitation ) in the cft , as the ir / uv duality teaches ( a position in the bulk is equivalent to size of an object ) @xcite .",
    "the evolution toward the black hole represents a growing size of the blob with the blob turning into a bubble travelling close to the speed of light @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall present the results of the following process : the radial infall of a small particle coupled to a massless scalar field , into a @xmath0-dimensional schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "we will consider that both the mass @xmath28 and the scalar charge @xmath29 of the particle are a perturbation on the background spacetime , i.e. , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the mas of the black hole and @xmath32 is the ads radius . in this approximation",
    "the background metric is not affected by the scalar field , and is given by @xmath33 where , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the area of a unit @xmath36 sphere , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the line element on the unit sphere @xmath39 .",
    "the action for the scalar field @xmath18 and particle is given by a sum of three parts , the action for the scalar field itself , the action for the particle and an interaction piece , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the background metric , @xmath42 its determinant , and @xmath43 represents the worldline of the particle as a function of an affine parameter @xmath44 .",
    "we now specialize to the radial infall case . in the usual ( asymptotically flat ) schwarzschild geometry",
    ", one can for example let a particle fall in from infinity with zero velocity there @xcite .",
    "the peculiar properties of ads spacetime do not allow a particle at rest at infinity @xcite ( we would need an infinite amount of energy for that ) so we consider the mass @xmath28 to be held at rest at a given distance @xmath45 in schwarzschild coordinates . at @xmath46",
    "the particle starts falling into the black hole .",
    "as the background is spherically symmetric , laplace s equation separates into the usual spherical harmonics @xmath47 defined over the @xmath36 unit sphere @xcite , where @xmath48 is the polar angle and @xmath49 are going to be considered azimuthal angles of the problem .",
    "in fact , since we are considering radial infall , the situation is symmetric with respect to a @xmath50 sphere",
    ". we can thus decompose the scalar field as @xmath51 the polar angle @xmath48 carries all the angular information , and @xmath52 is the angular quantum number associated with @xmath48 . from now on , instead of @xmath53 , we shall simply write @xmath54 for the spherical harmonics over the @xmath36 unit sphere .",
    "in fact @xmath54 is , apart from normalizations , just a gegenbauer polynomial @xmath55 @xcite . upon varying the action ( [ action ] ) , integrating over the @xmath36 sphere and using the orthonormality properties of the spherical harmonics we obtain the following equation for @xmath56 @xmath57 the potential @xmath58 appearing in equation ( [ waveequation1 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the eigenvalue of the laplacian on @xmath39 , and the tortoise coordinate @xmath61 is defined as @xmath62 . by defining the laplace transform @xmath63 of @xmath56 as @xmath64 then , equation ( [ waveequation1 ] ) transforms into @xmath65 with the source term @xmath66 given by , @xmath67 note that @xmath68 is the initial value of @xmath69 , i.e. , @xmath70 , satisfying @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "we have represented the particle s worldline by @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the proper time along a geodesic . here , @xmath75 describes the particle s radial trajectory giving the time as a function of radius along the geodesic @xmath76 with initial conditions @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "we have rescaled @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and measure everything in terms of @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath81 is to be read @xmath82 , @xmath83 is to be read @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the horizon radius is to be read @xmath86 .",
    "we can obtain @xmath68 , the initial value of @xmath69 , by solving numerically equation ( [ initial ] ) , demanding regularity at both the horizon and infinity ( for a similar problem , see for example @xcite ) . to present the initial data and the results we divide the problem into two categories : ( i ) small black holes with @xmath87 , and ( ii ) intermediate and large black holes with @xmath88 .",

    "two important remarks are in order : first , it is apparent from figs . 1 - 3 that the field ( sum over the multipoles ) is divergent at the particle s position @xmath45 .",
    "this is to be expected , as the particle is assumed to be point - like ; second , one is led to believe from figs . 1 - 3 ( but especially from figs . 2 - 3 ) that @xmath91 increases with @xmath52",
    "this is not true however , as this behavior is only valid for small values of the angular quantum number @xmath52 . for large @xmath52 , @xmath91 decreases with @xmath52 , in such a manner as to make @xmath102 in ( [ sphericalharmonics1 ] ) convergent and finite . for example , for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , we have at @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "equation ( [ waveequation2 ] ) is to be solved with the boundary conditions appropriate to ads spacetimes , but special attention must be paid to the initial data @xcite : ingoing waves at the horizon , @xmath108 and since the potential diverges at infinity we impose reflective boundary conditions ( @xmath109 ) there @xcite . naturally , given these boundary conditions , all the energy eventually sinks into the black hole .",
    "to implement a numerical solution , we note that two independent solutions @xmath110 and @xmath111 of ( [ waveequation2 ] ) , with the source term set to zero , have the behavior : @xmath112 here , the wronskian @xmath19 of these two solutions is a constant , @xmath113 .",

    "we are interested in computing the wavefunction @xmath120 near the horizon ( @xmath121 ) . in this limit",

    "all we need to do is to find a solution @xmath123 of the corresponding homogeneous equation satisfying the above mentioned boundary conditions ( [ behavior ] ) , and then numerically integrate it in ( [ z22 ] ) . in the numerical work , we chose to adopt @xmath79 as the independent variable , therefore avoiding the numerical inversion of @xmath124 . to find @xmath123,the integration ( of the homogeneous form of ( [ waveequation2 ] ) )",
    "was started at a large value of @xmath125 , which was @xmath126 typically .",
    "equation ( [ behavior ] ) was used to infer the boundary conditions @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "we then integrated inward from @xmath125 in to typically @xmath129 .",
    "equation ( [ behavior ] ) was then used to get @xmath130 .",
    "our numerical evolution for the field showed that some drastic changes occur when the size of the black hole varies , so we have chosen to divide the results in ( i ) small black holes and ( ii ) intermediate and large black holes .",
    "we will see that the behavior of these two classes is indeed strikingly different .",

    "( i ) : wave forms and spectra for small black holes , @xmath89 *    we plot the waveforms and the spectra . figs .",
    "4 - 7 are typical plots for small black holes of waveforms and spectra for @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( for @xmath133 and higher the conclusions are not altered ) .",
    "they show the first interesting aspect of our numerical results : for small black holes the @xmath131 signal is clearly dominated by quasinormal , exponentially decaying , ringing modes with a frequency @xmath4 ( scalar quasinormal frequencies of schwarzschild - ads black holes can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "this particular limit is a pure ads mode @xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "4 gives , for @xmath104 , @xmath134 .",
    "this yields a value near the pure ads mode for @xmath135 , @xmath136 . likewise , fig .",

    "all these features can be more clearly seen in the energy spectra plots , fig .",
    "6 , where one can observe the intense peak at @xmath4 .",
    "the conclusion is straightforward : spacetimes with small black holes behave as if the black hole was not there at all .",
    "this can be checked in yet another way by lowering the mass of the black hole .",
    "we have done that , and the results we have obtained show that as one lowers the mass of the hole , the ringing frequency goes to @xmath139 ( for @xmath104 ) and the imaginary part of the frequency , which gives us the damping scale for the mode , decreases as @xmath85 decreases . in this limit , the spacetime effectively behaves as a bounding box in which the modes propagate `` freely '' , and are not absorbed by the black hole .",

    "not shown is the spectra for higher values of the angular quantum number @xmath52 .",
    "the total energy going down the hole increases slightly with @xmath52 .",
    "this would lead us to believe that an infinite amount of energy goes down the hole .",
    "however , as first noted in @xcite , this divergence results from treating the incoming object as a point particle . taking a minimum size @xmath145 for",
    "the particle implies a cutoff in @xmath52 given by @xmath146 , and this problem is solved .    *",
    "( ii ) : wave forms and spectra for intermediate and large black holes , @xmath98 *    we plot the waveforms and the spectra . as we mentioned , intermediate and large black holes ( which are of more direct interest to the ads / cft ) behave differently .",
    "the signal is dominated by a sharp precursor near @xmath147 and there is no ringing : the waveform quickly settles down to the final zero value in a pure decaying fashion .",
    "the timescale of this exponential decay is , to high accuracy , given the inverse of the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency for the mode .",
    "the total energy is not a monotonic function of @xmath45 and still diverges if one naively sums over all the multipoles . in either case , there seem to be no power - law tails , as was expected from the work of ching et .",
    "al . @xcite .",

    "12 - is the initial data , and this can be most easily seen by looking at the value of @xmath152 near the horizon in fig .",
    "3 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this happens for small black holes also , which is only natural , since large negative @xmath151 means very early times , and at early times one can only see the initial data , since no information has arrived to tell that the particle has started to fall .",
    "the spectra in general does not peak at the lowest quasinormal frequency ( cf figs .",
    "10 , 11 and 13 ) , as it did in flat spacetime @xcite .",
    "( scalar quasinormal frequencies of schwarzschild - ads black holes can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , the location of the peak seems to have a strong dependence on @xmath45 ( compare figs .",
    "10 and 13 ) .",
    "this discrepancy has its roots in the behavior of the quasinormal frequencies .",
    "in fact , whereas in ( asymptotically ) flat spacetime the real part of the frequency is bounded and seems to go to a constant @xcite , in ads spacetime it grows without bound as a function of the principal quantum number @xmath153 @xcite . increasing the distance @xmath45 at which the particle begins to fall has the effect of increasing this effect ,",
    "so higher modes seem to be excited at larger distances .",

    "typical energy spectra ( for @xmath131 ) , here shown for @xmath98 , and @xmath100 . ]",
    "two important remarks regarding these results can be made :    \\(i ) the total energy radiated depends on the size of the infalling object , and the smaller the object is , the more energy it will radiate .",
    "this is a kind of a scalar analog in ads space of a well known result for gravitational radiation in flat space @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the fact that the radiation emitted in each multipole is high even for high multipoles leads us to another important point , first posed by horowitz and hubeny @xcite .",
    "while we are not able to garantee that the damping time scale stays bounded away from infinity ( as it seems ) , it is apparent from the numerical data that the damping time scale increases with increasing @xmath52 .",
    "thus it looks like the late time behavior of these kind of perturbations will be dominated by the largest @xmath52-mode ( @xmath154 ) , and this answers the question posed in @xcite .",
    "thus a perturbation in @xmath155 in the cft ] with given angular dependence @xmath156 on @xmath157 will decay exponentially with a time scale given by the imaginary part of the lowest quasinormal mode with _ that _ value of @xmath52 .",
    "we have computed the scalar energy emitted by a point test particle falling from rest into a schwarzschild - ads black hole .",
    "> from the point of view of the ads / cft conjecture , where the ( large ) black hole corresponds on the cft side to a thermal state , the infalling scalar particle corresponds to a specific perturbation of this state ( an expanding bubble ) , while the scalar radiation is interpreted as particles decaying into bosons of the associated operator of the gauge theory .",
    "previous works @xcite have shown that a general perturbation should have a timescale directly related to the inverse of the imaginary part of the quasinormal frequency , which means that the approach to thermal equilibrium on the cft should be governed by this timescale .",
    "we have shown through a specific important problem that this is in fact correct , but that it is not the whole story , since some important features of the waveforms highly depend on @xmath45 .",
    "overall , we expect to find the same type of features , at least qualitatively , in the gravitational or electromagnetic radiation by test particles falling into a schwarzschild - ads black hole . for example",
    ", if the black hole is small , we expect to find in the gravitational radiation spectra a strong peak located at @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "moreover , some major results in perturbation theory and numerical relativity @xcite , studying the collision of two black holes , with masses of the same order of magnitude , allow us to infer that evolving the collision of two black holes in ads spacetime , should not bring major differences in relation to our results ( though it is of course a much more difficult task , even in perturbation theory ) . in particular , in the small black hole regime , the spectra and waveforms should be dominated by quasinormal ringing .",
