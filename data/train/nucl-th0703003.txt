    "the concepts of @xmath8-scaling  @xcite and superscaling ( based on @xmath9-scaling variable )  @xcite have been used for extensive analyses of the vast amount of inclusive electron scattering world data ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses showed the existence of high - momentum components in the nucleon momentum distribution ( md ) @xmath6 at momenta @xmath10  @xmath11 due to the presence of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) correlations .",
    "scaling of the first kind ( _ i.e. _ no dependence on the momentum transfer ) can be observed at excitation energies below the quasielastic ( qe ) peak .",
    "scaling of second kind ( _ i.e. _ no dependence on the mass number ) is excellent in the same region .",
    "when scaling of first and second type occur one says that superscaling takes place .",
    "it was shown ( _ e.g. _ , in  @xcite ) that the physical reason for the superscaling phenomena is the specific high - momentum tail of @xmath6 which is similar for all nuclei .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that due to the contribution introduced by inelastic scattering together with the correlation contribution and meson exchange currents  @xcite both scaling of the first and , to a lesser extent , of the second kind are violated at energies above the qe peak .",
    "the theoretical concept of superscaling has been introduced in  @xcite using the properties of the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model .",
    "the fermi momentum for the rfg was used as a physical scale to define the proper scaling variable @xmath12 for each nucleus . as emphasized in  @xcite , however , the actual dynamical physics content of the superscaling phenomenon is more complex than that provided by the rfg model . in particular , the extension of the superscaling property to large negative values of @xmath12 ( @xmath1 )",
    "is not predicted by the rfg model . the qe scaling function in the rfg model @xmath13 for @xmath14 , whereas the experimental scaling function @xmath15 has been observed for large negative values of @xmath12 up to @xmath16 in the data for @xmath17 processes .",
    "thus , it has been necessary to consider the superscaling in theoretical approaches which go beyond the rfg model .",
    "one of them is the coherent density fluctuation model ( cdfm ) ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) which gives a natural extension of the fermi gas case to realistic finite nuclear systems .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that in the cdfm both basic quantities , density and momentum distributions , are responsible for the scaling and superscaling phenomena in nuclei .",
    "the results of the cdfm for the qe scaling function @xmath0 agree with the available experimental data at different transferred momenta and energies below the qe peak position , showing superscaling for @xmath18 , including @xmath19 and going well beyond the rfg model . secondly ,",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the nucleon momentum distribution for various nuclei obtained in  @xcite ( and with the modification in  @xcite ) within a theoretical approach based on the light - front dynamics ( lfd ) method ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) can also be used to describe both @xmath8- and @xmath12-scaling data .",
    "the superscaling analyses of inclusive electron scattering from nuclei ( for energies of several hundred mev to a few gev ) have been extended in  @xcite to include not only qe processes but also the region where @xmath20 excitation dominates .",
    "both qe scaling functions @xmath15 and @xmath21 in the delta region were deduced from phenomenological fits to electron - nuclei scattering data .",
    "generally , the specific features of the scaling function should be accounted for by reliable microscopic calculations that take final - state interactions into account . in particular , the scaling function @xmath22 with asymmetric shape obtained in  @xcite by using a relativistic mean field ( rmf ) for the final states agrees well with the experimental scaling function .",
    "the features of the superscaling phenomenon in inelastic electron scattering have induced studies of neutrino scattering from nuclei on the same basis .",
    "the neutrino - nucleus interactions have been studied using the superscaling analyses of few - gev inclusive electron scattering data in a method proposed in  @xcite to predict the inclusive @xmath23 and @xmath24 cross sections for the case of @xmath25c in the nuclear resonance region .",
    "various other theoretical considerations ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) have been devoted to studies of both neutral- ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) and charge - changing ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) neutrino - nucleus scattering .",
    "the cdfm and the lfd method have been extended in  @xcite from the qe to the delta - excitation region of the inclusive electron scattering and the qe scaling functions calculated in both methods have been used to calculate and to predict charge - changing neutrino - nucleus cross sections of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 reactions on @xmath25c at energies from 1 to 2  gev .",
    "the asymmetry in the cdfm qe scaling function has been introduced in a phenomenological way .",
    "these analyses make it possible to gain information about the nucleon correlation effects on both nucleon momentum and local density distributions .",
    "it became clear that only the detailed knowledge of the behavior of @xmath6 at high momenta in realistic nuclear systems could lead to quantitative agreement with the experimental scaling function .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of the latter gives a valuable information about the nn correlation effects on the tail of the momentum distribution .",
    "so , it was shown in  @xcite within the cdfm that the @xmath8- and @xmath28-scaling data are informative for @xmath6 at momenta up to @xmath29@xmath30  @xmath11 and it was concluded that further experiments are necessary in studies of the high - momentum components of the nucleon momentum distributions .",
    "the aim of the present work is to consider in more detail the connection between the nn forces in nuclear medium and their effect on the components of @xmath6 from one side and , from the other side , the role of @xmath6 on the behavior of the qe scaling function . for this purpose",
    "we use firstly the md in a hard - sphere dilute fermi gas model ( hsdfg ) ( _ e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) to calculate the scaling function .",
    "secondly , we make an attempt to throw light on the connection between the generally established high - momentum asymptotics of @xmath6  @xcite and the qe scaling function .",
    "the latter makes it possible to establish ( at least approximately ) the particular form of the power - law decrease of @xmath6 at large values of @xmath4 .",
    "this makes it possible to extract additional information about the nn forces from the description of the superscaling phenomenon .    the theoretical scheme and",
    "the results of calculations are given in section  [ sect2ant ] .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section  [ sect3ant ] .",
    "in the first part of this section we consider the hard - sphere dilute fermi gas , _",
    "i.e. _ the low - density fermi gas whose particles interact via a repulsive hard - core potential ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ ,  @xcite ) , and use the nucleon momentum distribution in such a system to calculate the scaling function @xmath31 .",
    "the quantities of interest in the hsdfg model can be expanded in powers of the parameter @xmath32 , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) denotes the hard - core radius in the nn interactions or it is identified with the scattering length in free space , and @xmath35 is the fermi momentum . in  @xcite",

    "one can see that the hsdfg scaling function is extended for large negative values of @xmath12 in contrast to the case of the rfg scaling function , but there is not a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "one can see in the figures also the step behavior of the scaling function which reflects the discontinuity of @xmath6 at @xmath68 .",

    "the grey area shows experimental data taken from  @xcite.,width=302 ]    we should note that this particular form of the power - law asymptotics is close to that obtained in the cdfm  @xcite @xmath98 i.e. it corresponds to @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of @xmath71 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 gives @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "we would like to emphasize the consistency of both the optimal asymptotics of @xmath6 for the dilute fermi gas found in this work [ eq .",
    "( [ eq14ant ] ) ] with that in the cdfm [ eq .  ( [ eq15ant ] ) ]",
    "as was shown in  @xcite the calculated qe scaling function @xmath0 in the cdfm agrees well with the experimental scaling function .",
    "this fact shows that the behavior of the qe scaling function depends mainly on the particular form of the power - law asymptotics of the nucleon momentum distribution .",
    "this is proved on our work by the similarities of the result for the case of an interacting dilute fermi gas with that one obtained in the cdfm as a model accounting for nn correlations in realistic finite nuclear systems .",
    "the results of the present work can be summarized as follows :    i ) : :    the superscaling observed in inclusive electron scattering from nuclei    is considered within the model of dilute fermi gas with interactions    between particles .",
    "the latter gives an improvement in comparison with    the results of the relativistic non - interacting fermi gas model    allowing one to describe the qe scaling function for    @xmath1 , whereas the rfg model gives    @xmath2 in this region .",
    "ii ) : :    it is established that the hard - sphere ( with delta - forces between    nucleons ) approximation for the dilute fermi gas is quite a rough one .",
    "the use of more realistic nn forces leading to    @xmath105 instead of @xmath106 ( for    delta - force ) in the well - known power - law asymptotics of the momentum    distribution @xmath107 at large    @xmath4 leads to a good explanation of the data for the    @xmath9-scaling function in inclusive electron scattering    from a wide range of nuclei .",
    "iii ) : :    the asymptotics of @xmath108 found in the    dilute fermi gas by optimal fit to the data for    @xmath0 is similar to that in the cdfm    ( @xmath109 )  @xcite which , being a theoretical    correlation model , describes the superscaling in the quasielastic part    of the electron - nucleus scattering .",
    "thus , the momentum distribution in    the dilute fermi - gas model with realistic nn forces can serve as an    `` effective '' momentum distribution ( a step - like one with a    discontinuity ) which gives a similar result for    @xmath0 as the correlation methods for realistic    finite nuclear systems .",
    "it can be concluded that the momentum    distribution with asymptotics from @xmath109 to    @xmath110 is the proper one to explain the phenomenological shape of    the scaling function obtained from inclusive qe electron scattering .",
    "as already mentioned , the superscaling is due to the _ specific high - momentum tail _ of @xmath6 similar for all nuclei which is known to be caused by the short - range and tensor correlations related _ to peculiarities of the nn forces _ near their core .",
    "the main result of the present work might be the observation that the values of @xmath0 for @xmath1 depend on _ the particular form _ of the power - law asymptotics of @xmath6 at large @xmath4 which is related to _ a corresponding particular behavior _ of the _ in - medium nn forces _ around the core .",
    "namely , we point out that the power - law decrease of @xmath6 as @xmath111 with @xmath112 in the interacting dilute fermi gas is the proper one and it is close to that obtained in cdfm ( @xmath100 @xcite ) which describes the superscaling correctly as well .",
    "the nn force for @xmath100 is expected to go as @xmath103 and for @xmath113 to go as @xmath114 .",
    "hence , the present study allows one to conclude that the important property of the repulsive short - range core ( leading to nn correlations and high - momentum tail of @xmath6 ) is that it goes to infinity for @xmath115 as @xmath116 or softer .",
    "the link between the asymptotic behavior of @xmath6 and nn force implies that inclusive qe electron scattering from nuclei provides important information on the nn forces in the nuclear medium .",
