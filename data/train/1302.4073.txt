    "synchronization of chaotic systems is a subject widely studied in recent years , having both theoretical and applied significance  @xcite . of a particular interest is the intricate phenomenon of generalized synchronization ( gs ) , originally introduced as an emerging collective motion of unidirectionally coupled chaotic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "gs has been , indeed , observed in numerous systems , both numerically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite , and its main features  @xcite have suggested many possible applications  @xcite .",
    "the very same concept of gs has been introduced initially in the case of two unidirectionally coupled oscillators , the drive ( or master ) @xmath0 system and the response ( or slave ) @xmath1 one .",
    "gs means the presence of a time independent functional relation @xmath2 $ ] between the master and slave system states , after a suitable transient time interval is elapsed  @xcite , i.e. @xmath3}.\\ ] ] in this paper , we report on the extension of the concept of gs for both oscillators with a bidirectional coupling , and for complex networks architectures .",
    "it is , indeed , evident that eq .",
    "( [ eq : functrel ] ) needs to be extended for reflecting the fact that a mutual interaction exists between the systems under study .",
    "the traditional definition of gs in the form of  ( [ eq : functrel ] ) introduced for the unidirectionally coupled chaotic oscillators is based on the fact that the drive system state @xmath0 does not depend on the state of the response system @xmath1 . hence , for the gs regime eq .",
    "( [ eq : functrel ] ) may be applied at every moment of time @xmath4 . in the case of the mutual type of coupling between systems",
    "the situation is radically different , since the interacting oscillators are equivalent from the point of view of the coupling , and the evolution of the first system is determined not only by the vector @xmath0 , but also by the the state of the second system @xmath1 , and vice versa .",
    "therefore , in the general case the functional relation between states of the mutually coupled systems can not be written in the explicit form  ( [ eq : functrel ] ) , and , as a consequence , the implicit functional relation must be used . to take into account the common action of the systems on each other",

    ", we assume that the generalized synchronization regime implies the presence of a functional relation between the system states , as before , but this relation takes the implicit form  ( [ eq : networkfunctrel ] ) instead of ( [ eq : functrel ] ) , i.e. it implies the arousal of a generic manifold in phase - space wherein the overall trajectory is lying during its time evolution .",
    "for the unidirectionally coupled oscillators the lyapunov exponents calculation is known to allow to detect the gs boundary more precisely in comparison with the nearest neighbor method , whereas the last one gives mostly only the qualitative confirmation of the gs regime presence .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the lyapunov exponents to detect the gs regime in the mutually coupled systems . as far as the nearest neighbor method is concerned , we use it for the verification of the obtained results .",
    "if the dimensions of the drive and response systems are @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , the behavior of the unidirectionally coupled oscillators is characterized by the lyapunov exponent spectrum @xmath12 . due to the independence of the drive system dynamics on the behavior of the response one",
    ", the lyapunov exponent spectrum may be divided into two parts  @xcite : les of the drive system @xmath13 and les of the response one @xmath14 . for the gs detection in the unidirectionally coupled chaotic oscillators the lyapunov exponents calculated for the response system play the key role ( since the behavior of the response depends on the drive , these lyapunov exponents are called conditional ) . with the increase of the coupling strength",
    "the largest conditional lyapunov exponent @xmath15 becomes negative at the onset of the gs regime  @xcite .",
    "thus , the negativity of the largest conditional lyapunov exponent @xmath16 is considered as a criterion of the gs presence in the unidirectionally coupled dynamical systems  @xcite . since in the case of the mutual coupling the spectrum of lyapunov exponents",
    "can not be divided into two parts corresponding to the drive and response systems , condition  ( [ eq : clegscondition ] ) must also be modified .",
    "notice that , here , the dimension of each element is assumed to be @xmath17 , but this analytical study may be extended easily to the other systems with arbitrary dimensions @xmath10 .    as it has already been mentioned , in the neighborhood of any moment of time @xmath4   eq .",
    "( [ eq : mutualfunctrel ] ) may be considered as the definition of the implicit functional relation between system states , and , therefore , according to the implicit - function theorem  @xcite , locally , the implicit definition of the functional relation between system states may be used , i.e. , @xmath18 $ ] or @xmath19 $ ] .",

    "in other words , in the selected area of the @xmath27 phase - space the manifold corresponding to the gs regime is characterized by one unstable direction @xmath28 and one direction with the neutral stability @xmath29 lying inside this manifold , whereas all other directions are stable .",

    "so , one can come to conclusion that in the case of the mutual type of coupling the manifold corresponding to the gs regime at every moment of time is characterized by one unstable direction , one direction with the neutral stability and four stable directions .",
    "so , having calculated the spectrum of lyapunov exponents for two bidirectionally coupled chaotic oscillators one obtain that the gs regime in this case produces one positive , one zero and four negative lyapunov exponents . since in the case of the mutual coupling one can not pick out the conditional lyapunov exponents , the criterion of the gs regime should be written in the form @xmath32 whereas @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "having extended this theoretical consideration to the complex networks ( where the implicit form of the functional relation is given by ( [ eq : networkfunctrel ] ) ) one can obtain that condition  ( [ eq : bidirlegscondition ] ) remains also correct for the gs regime existence in these networks .    to validate the presence of the generalized synchronization regime , in parallel with the calculation of the spectrum of lyapunov exponents",
    ", one can also make use of the nearest neighbor method  @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this technique consists in the fact that the presence of the functional relation between the interacting system states means that all close states ( `` origins '' ) in the phase sub - space of a given system @xmath0 should correspond to close states ( `` images '' ) in the phase sub - space of the other one @xmath1 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for mutually coupled oscillators the inverse statement must be also correct , i.e. all close states in the phase sub - space of the second system @xmath1 must correspond to close states of the first one @xmath0 .    as a numerical indicator of the existence of a functional relationship between the interacting systems , the mean distance between images @xmath35 of nearest neighbors @xmath36 normalized by the average distance @xmath21 of randomly chosen states of the first system , i.e.",
    "@xmath37 can be calculated ( here @xmath38 is the number of the points chosen randomly )  @xcite .",
    "this characteristic allows to reveal the qualitative changes in the synchonous / asynchonous behavior of the coupled systems . when the coupling between systems is very small and oscillators show the asynchronous dynamics the value of this measure is @xmath39 .",
    "the phase synchronization regime causes the sharp decrease of the value @xmath40 but it differs from zero sufficiently , as before , whereas deep inside the generalized synchronization region @xmath40 tends to be zero due to the presence of the functional relation between states of the interacting systems . in the vicinity of the gs boundary ( both inside and outside the gs area )",
    "the value of @xmath40-quantity decreases slowly to zero value , with the onset of the generalized synchronization regime corresponding approximately to the middle of this transition interval .",
    "unfortunately , the nearest neighbor method does not allow to detect precisely the boundary points of the gs regime , but it allows to confirm the presence of gs and to estimate the location of the gs boundary .",

    "one can see easily that in the case under consideration the coupling strength value corresponding to the onset of gs is larger sufficiently than the analogous value for two mutually coupled rssler systems  ( [ eq : roesslers ] ) and pierce diodes ( [ eq : piercediodes ] ) .",

    "[ fgr : roesnetwnn ] the phase portraits of all rssler systems of the network are shown for two values of the coupling strength , below ( fig .  [ fgr : roesnetwnn],_a _ , @xmath135 ) and above ( fig .",

    "have been selected randomly (  @xmath139 ,  @xmath140 ,  @xmath141 ) and the points corresponding to them have been detected in all other coupled systems . for @xmath135 ( fig .",
    "[ fgr : roesnetwnn],_a",
    "_ ) the points are concentrated in a limited range of attractor and distributed along the radius being the evidence of the presence of ps and the absence of gs . for @xmath71 ( fig .",
    "[ fgr : roesnetwnn],_b _ ) all states of all oscillators are nearest neighbors , thus proving the existence of gs .",
    "vs @xmath43 for the network of rssler oscillators ( [ eq : rosslernetwork ] ) .",
    "the onset of the gs regime in the network @xmath61 is shown by the arrow , width=309 ]    similarly to the case of two mutually coupled rssler oscillators considered above we compare the onset of the gs and ls in the network ( [ eq : rosslernetwork ] ) .",
    "but due to the small values of the control parameter detuning the ls regime is very close to the complete synchronization ( cs ) one . in the simulations ,",
    "the onset of the cs regime can be monitored by looking at the vanishing of the time average ( over a window @xmath142 ) synchronization error @xmath143 in the present case , we adopt as vector norm @xmath144 .",
    "[ fgr : erro ] reports the synchronization error versus @xmath43 for a given topology .",
    "one can see that the synchronization error becomes close to zero considerably later the gs regime arising .",
    "when the gs regime takes place @xmath145 is still positive that is the evidence of the cs regime absence .",
    "so , the gs regime in networks of coupled nonlinear elements can be detected by the moment of transition of the second ( positive ) lyapunov exponent in the field of the negative values .",
    "now we analyze the influence of the number of elements and topology of the network on the gs regime onset . in fig .",
    "[ fgr : largenet ] the boundaries of the gs regime on the `` number of elements @xmath6  coupling parameter @xmath43''plane for networks of different topologies of links between nodes are shown . curve _",
    "1 _ corresponds to the random network whereas curves _ 2 _ and _ 3 _ refer to the regular and `` small - world '' networks , respectively . for all considered cases the values of the control parameters @xmath146",
    "have been selected randomly in such a way that the probability distribution density of @xmath146-values has been obeyed by the gaussian distribution with the mean value @xmath147 and variance @xmath148 that corresponds to the case of the relatively large values of the control parameter detuning .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ fgr : largenet ] that the topology of the network influences sufficiently on the gs regime onset .",
    "in particular , the threshold of the gs regime onset decreases for the random network , whereas both for the regular and `` small world '' ones it increases monotonically . at that",
    ", the boundary of gs for regular network grows more rapidly in comparison with the `` small world '' one .",
    "now , following the approach of some of our previous works  @xcite , we move to reveal the mechanisms associated with the emergence of the gs regime in the case of a generic ensemble of coupled systems ( with , obviously , the case of two coupled oscillators considered as the simplest variant of such a configuration ) .    for the purpose of exemplification , and without lack of generality , we here - below characterize the state of the network by the only vector @xmath149 , where @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , instead of the set of vectors @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "the dimension of each element of the network is assumed to be @xmath17 again , but this analytical study may be extended easily to the other systems with arbitrary dimensions @xmath10 .      coupling parameter @xmath43''plane for random ( curve _ 1 _ ) , regular ( curve _ 2 _ ) and `` small world '' ( curve _ 3 _ ) networks , width=309 ]    following the above formalism , the entire network may be considered as a high - dimensional autonomous dynamical system , whose evolution equation is given by @xmath155 here the vector function @xmath156 determines the evolution of the elements of the network in the absence of the coupling , whereas the additive term @xmath157 describes the influence of the topology and the coupling strength of the links between oscillators .",
    "matrix @xmath158 specifies the structure of the dissipative couplings between nodes , and it is assumed to be a symmetric zero row sum matrix , @xmath159 , with @xmath160 ( @xmath130 ) being equal to 1 whenever variable @xmath161 forces the variable @xmath162 and 0 otherwise .",
    "it is easy to see that the term @xmath163 brings the additional dissipation into the system  ( [ eq : networkequation ] ) .",
    "indeed , the phase flow contraction is characterized by means of the vector field divergence @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the elementary volume of the phase space of the system  ( [ eq : networkequation ] ) . since @xmath166 ,",
    "the term @xmath167 is also negative and the dissipation in the considered group increases with the growth of the coupling strength @xmath43 , resulting in the simplification of the otherwise chaotic dynamics of the system  ( [ eq : networkequation ] ) .    to characterize the complexity of the motion , the spectrum of lyapunov exponents is frequently used . in the case under study ,",
    "let s suppose that the behavior of the system  ( [ eq : networkequation ] ) is initially described by the set @xmath168 of lyapunov exponents , with @xmath6 of them being positive ( i.e. , while no synchronous motion is set up , each one of the elements of the network contributes independently with one positive lyapunov exponent to the overall spectrum ) .",
    "as dissipation increases , some of the initially positive lyapunov exponents become negative , and each passage of a lyapunov exponent trough zero testifies that one more degree of freedom of the chaotic motion corresponds to a contractive direction . when @xmath60 becomes negative , only one degree of freedom is representative of the evolution of the network , i.e. a gs regime is built . indeed , as soon as @xmath60 is negative , all systems have to arrange their evolution into a specific collective motion , wherein the functional relation  ( [ eq : networkfunctrel ] ) is taking place .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed the gs regime in systems with a mutual type of the coupling .",
    "we have extended the definition of gs , for being valid also for pairs of mutually coupled chaotic oscillators , and for the complex networks . the gs regime onset in 3d systems",
    "is shown to be connected with the zero - crossing of the second lyapunov exponent .",
    "gs may be , therefore , considered in terms of the transition from the high - dimensional hyperchaotic regime to the chaotic oscillations .",
    "the obtained results are proved by means of the nearest neighbor method .",
    "since the developed theory is applicable to different systems , we expect that the very same mechanism will be observed in many other relevant circumstances .",
    "particularly , the obtained results could be extended to the systems which dimension of the phase space @xmath169 including the spatially extended media and coupled systems with a different dimension of the phase space ."
