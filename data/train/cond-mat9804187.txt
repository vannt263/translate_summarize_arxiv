    "biological membranes consist of a fluid lipid bilayer with embedded amphiphilic macromolecules such as integral proteins @xcite .",
    "integral proteins are expected to be much less flexible than the lipid matrix . in a general sense ,",
    "any molecule embedded in the membrane and differing in shape or elastic properties from the surrounding lipid molecules can be viewed as an inclusion .",
    "the phase behavior of inclusions in the plane of the membrane is determined by interactions between them .",
    "if the interaction energy is sufficiently large to compete with translational entropy , it can lead to lateral self - assembly of the inclusions .",
    "attractive forces may result in a lateral aggregation of the inclusions , while repulsion can give rise to a regular array with maximal spacing .",
    "forces between membrane inclusions can be divided into two classes .",
    "the first class consists of the well - known direct interactions , namely electrostatic ( for charged inclusions ) and van der waals forces .",
    "a second class comprises indirect interactions mediated by some kind of membrane deformation @xcite .",
    "these interactions are determined by the shapes of the inclusions and the elastic parameters of the inclusions and the lipid bilayer .",
    "they can be static or dynamic , in one case being due to equilibrium deformations and in the other to shape fluctuations of the membrane .",
    "both types of indirect interactions have been theoretically studied for the case of zero lateral tension .",
    "the static interactions of inclusions affecting the membrane thickness @xcite and of conical deformations affecting the membrane shape @xcite have been dealt with .",
    "dynamic interactions were treated for inclusions modifying the local bending moduli @xcite , including the case of rigid disks @xcite .    in the following we consider the static interaction between conical inclusions in the presence of lateral tension .",
    "two sketches of a truncated cone embedded in the membrane are given in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the cone is assumed to be rigid and to impose a uniform slope on the surrounding membrane which returns asymptotically to the flat state at large distances .",
    "we find repulsive interaction at all values of the lateral tension if the two conical inclusions have equal orientation with respect to the membrane plane . by increasing the lateral tension ,",
    "the interaction is weakened at larger , but enhanced at smaller inclusion distances .",
    "in contrast , for opposite orientations of the inclusions in a membrane with non - vanishing lateral tension the sign of the interaction depends on the distance between the inclusions . at small separations the inclusions",
    "repel each other , while at large separations the interaction is attractive . with rising tension the attractive potential well deepens and moves towards smaller distances between the inclusions",
    "we consider a membrane with two embedded conical inclusions .",
    "the cross - sections of the inclusions in the mid - plane of the membrane are circles of radius @xmath0 .",
    "the centers of the two circles are separated by the distance @xmath1 ( see fig .  3 ) .    in the absence of inclusions",
    "the membrane is assumed to be flat and to lie in the of the cartesian system of coordinates .",
    "we describe the membrane equilibrium shape produced by the inclusions by a function @xmath2 which determines the displacement of the membrane from the @xmath3-plane in @xmath4 direction ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "at the boundaries of the conical inclusions the displacement @xmath5 is assumed to fulfill the conditions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath6 where the subscript @xmath7 takes the values 1 or 2 for the first and the second inclusion , respectively . by @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "we denote the polar coordinates related to the center of projection @xmath10 of the respective inclusion on the @xmath3-plane ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "the first equation in ( 1 ) describes the boundary of each inclusion as a circle of radius @xmath0 whose center is at height @xmath11 above the @xmath3-plane and which is tilted with respect to the @xmath4 axes by an angle @xmath12 in the @xmath13-direction .",
    "the second equation in ( 1 ) takes into account that due to the conical shape of the inclusion the membrane is attached to the circumference of the tilted circle with a constant angle @xmath14 .",
    "it is assumed in ( 1 ) that the contact angle @xmath14 and tilt angle @xmath12 are small , @xmath15 , so that we set @xmath16 , @xmath17 and neglect contributions of the order of magnitude of @xmath18 determining the deviation of the inclusion projection from the circular shape . at large distances from the inclusions ,",
    "@xmath19 , the membrane remains flat , so that for @xmath20 .",
    "the inclusions characterized by small @xmath14 and @xmath12 can produce only a weak deformation of the initially flat membrane , which means that the gradient of the function @xmath2 remains small , @xmath21 , everywhere along the membrane . the membrane energy @xcite",
    "can then be written in the approximate form @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the bending rigidity , @xmath24 the lateral tension , @xmath25 the gaussian curvature and @xmath26 the modulus of the gaussian curvature . in our approximation ,",
    "the laplacian @xmath27 equals the sum of the principal curvatures of the membrane @xmath28 , while @xmath29 gives the increase of membrane area per unit projected area due to membrane tilt @xmath30 .",
    "the integration of ( 2 ) is performed over the projected area .",
    "the membrane shape is determined by the euler  lagrange equation following from ( [ 2 ] ) @xmath31    we derive the interaction energy of two conical inclusions in two steps .",
    "first , we solve the shape equation ( [ 3 ] ) accounting for the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and the asymptotic boundary condition for @xmath20 .",
    "second , inserting the obtained function @xmath2 into ( [ 2 ] ) , we determine the membrane energy . throughout this calculation",
    "we assume the inclusion distance @xmath1 to be large compared to the radius of inclusion @xmath0 and retain only the leading terms in @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to note that the interaction energy can not depend on the modulus of gaussian curvature @xmath26 . according to the theorem of gauss - bonnet",
    "an integral of the gaussian curvature @xmath25 over a surface is equal to the negative sum of the line integrals of the geodetical curvature @xmath33 over the surface boundaries ( apart from a constant that depends only on the genus of the surface ) .",
    "the value of the geodetical curvature at the inclusion boundaries is completely determined by the radius @xmath0 and contact angles @xmath14 ( @xmath34 ) and does not depend on the distance @xmath1 between the inclusions .",
    "therefore , the integral of the gaussian curvature @xmath25 over the membrane must be independent of the distance @xmath1 and does not contribute to the interaction potential .",
    "for any given distance @xmath1 between the inclusions the energy has to be minimized with respect to the heights @xmath11 and tilt angles @xmath12 .",
    "this results in conditions of zero vertical force and zero torque acting on each inclusion .",

    "they are obtained from ( [ a2 ] ) derived in appendix b and have the form : @xmath43 terms of ( [ a2 ] ) proportional to @xmath44 are omitted in ( [ 9 ] ) because of the mirror symmetry of the system with respect to the @xmath45-plane ( see fig .",
    "3 ) , and terms exhibiting higher than logarithmical divergence for @xmath20 are left out since they violate the boundary condition of an asymptotically flat membrane for @xmath20 .",
    "the only exceptions are @xmath46 and @xmath47 . from the boundary condition of an asymptotically flat membrane",
    "it can be concluded immediately that the coefficient @xmath48 must be equal to @xmath49 .",
    "the sum of the corresponding terms then diverges only logarithmically for @xmath20 .",
    "the terms @xmath47 are proportional to the cartesian coordinate @xmath13 and thus describe rotations of the membrane as a whole @xcite .",
    "any such rotations must be equal but opposite , i.e.  @xmath50 , to satisfy the boundary conditions at infinity , so that we can as well drop these terms .",
    "the coefficients @xmath51 in ( [ 9 ] ) are determined from the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and equilibrium conditions ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "consider these conditions at the circumference of inclusion 2 .",
    "to apply them we have to express the membrane shape ( [ 6 ] ) in the vicinity of the inclusion .",
    "the function @xmath42 is simply given by ( [ 9 ] ) with @xmath52 . to present the function @xmath41 in a convenient form",
    "we take ( [ 9 ] ) with @xmath53 and insert ( [ 7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) into it . in the vicinity of the second inclusion",
    "the value of @xmath54 is close to the inclusion radius @xmath55 . using the assumption @xmath56 and ,",
    "consequently , @xmath57 we perform a taylor expansion about the center of the inclusion projection @xmath58 @xmath59 the resulting expression for the membrane shape , @xmath60 is @xmath61 where @xmath62 inserting ( [ 11 ] ) into the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and equilibrium conditions ( [ 4 ] ) at the inclusion 2 we obtain a series of equations for the coefficients @xmath51 .    to account for the boundary and equilibrium conditions at the inclusion 1 ,",
    "we perform the same procedure as described above to obtain identical equations in which the index 2 is replaced by 1 and _ vice versa_.    the equations obtained for the coefficients @xmath51 can be solved order by order in the small parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the solutions are @xmath63 and equivalent results for @xmath64 , the remaining coefficients being of third or higher order in @xmath32 .",
    "we are now in a position to compute the energy of the membrane . omitting the contribution of the integral of the gaussian curvature , which is independent of the distance @xmath1 between the inclusions ( see above ) we obtain from ( [ 2 ] )",
    "@xmath65 where the curvature @xmath28 is given by @xmath66 in the first non - vanishing order in @xmath32 , the energy of interaction of the inclusions is @xmath67{0cm}{1.3cm}$\\hspace*{.5cm}\\displaystyle       g(r)=4\\pi\\kappa(\\alpha_1 ^ 2+\\alpha_2 ^ 2)\\frac{a^4}{r^4 }                + o\\left(\\frac{1}{r^5}\\right)\\hspace*{.5cm}$}\\label{14}\\ ] ] according to ( [ 14 ] ) , the energy is positive and decays monotonically at all values of the contact angles @xmath68 , @xmath69 and all distances between the inclusions @xmath1 .",
    "this means that in the case of zero lateral tension the interaction between the rigid conical inclusions is always repulsive .",
    "the result ( [ 14 ] ) is in agreement with an earlier calculation @xcite which in addition predicts a contribution proportional to @xmath26 , the modulus of gaussian curvature .",
    "we think that there should be no @xmath26 term ( see end of section ii ) .",
    "we now extend the methods of the previous section to analyze the interactions of inclusions embedded in a membrane subject to non - vanishing lateral tension @xmath24 .",
    "the shape equation ( [ 3 ] ) can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 has the dimension of a reciprocal length . to find a solution of the shape equation satisfying the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and equilibrium conditions ( [ 4 ] ) we use , as in the previous section , ansatz ( [ 6 ] ) with the functions @xmath72 being general solutions of the shape equation ( [ 15 ] ) in polar coordinates .",
    "these functions are taken from ( [ a3 ] ) derived in appendix b and have the form : @xmath73 the coefficients of all terms of ( [ a3 ] ) proportional to @xmath44 are taken equal to zero because of the symmetry of the system .",
    "also , the coefficients of terms violating the boundary condition of asymptotically vanishing gradient of the displacement , for @xmath20 , must be zero . as we do not consider rotations of the system we set @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , we omit in ( [ 16 ] ) the logarithmic term of ( [ a3 ] ) , as the related change of the area of the membrane would result in an infinite energy of the lateral tension @xmath24 .    equation ( [ 16 ] ) transforms into ( [ 9 ] ) in the limit of vanishing lateral tension , @xmath75 ( i.e.  ) .",
    "this can be shown by inserting into ( [ 16 ] ) the approximative expressions of the bessel functions @xmath76 for small arguments @xmath13",
    "@xmath77    the coefficients @xmath51 in ( [ 16 ] ) are determined by the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and equilibrium conditions ( [ 4 ] ) in a way similar to that described in the preceding section .",
    "for example , we present @xmath41 in the vicinity of the inclusion 2 by inserting ( 7 ) and ( 8) and obtain after an expansion in the small parameter @xmath78 @xmath79 we have to stress that in this case the expansions up to the second order in @xmath78 are sufficient only if @xmath80 . for @xmath81 , which is equivalent to the condition of strong lateral tension , the series ( [ 19 ] )",
    "converges too slowly to be approximated by the sum of just a few taylor terms .",
    "this can be seen from the asymptotic expansion of the functions @xmath76 which for large arguments are proportional to @xmath82 irrespectively of @xmath83 .    inserting the sum ( [ 16 ] ) with @xmath52 and ( [ 19 ] ) into the boundary conditions ( [ 1 ] ) and the equilibrium conditions ( [ 4 ] ) at inclusion 2 ,",
    "we obtain for @xmath56 and @xmath80 a set of linear equations for the coefficients @xmath51 . applying the same procedure to satisfy the boundary and equilibrium conditions at",
    "the inclusion 1 leads to an analogous set of equations . solving all these equations for @xmath56 and @xmath80 we obtain @xmath84 \\nonumber c_4^{(1)}=-\\alpha_2 a ( \\xi a)^2 k_2(\\xi r)+\\ldots \\hspace*{3cm}\\label{20}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and corresponding results for @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the interaction energy ( [ 22 ] ) depends on the relative orientation of the conical inclusions .",
    "if the cones are oriented in the same direction , their contact angles @xmath68 , @xmath69 have the same sign . in this case the energy of interaction is always positive and decreases with increasing distance @xmath1 .",
    "the repulsive potential is illustrated in fig .  4 for two identical and equally oriented inclusions at different lateral tensions .",
    "by increasing the tension the interaction is weakened at large , but enhanced at small inclusion distances .",
    "if the inclusions are oppositely oriented , the contact angles @xmath68 and @xmath69 have different signs and the energy of interaction behaves non - monotonically , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the energy has a minimum at a finite separation @xmath95 of the inclusions .",
    "this means that the forces between the inclusions change from repulsive to attractive depending on the distance @xmath1 . for distances shorter than @xmath95 the inclusions",
    "repel each other , while for separations @xmath96 the interaction is attractive .",
    "with rising lateral tension the separation of zero force , @xmath95 , moves towards smaller values and the associated potential well deepens ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "to summarize , we derived an interaction energy between two conical inclusions embedded in a fluid membrane subject to lateral tension . for this purpose , we calculated the equilibrium shape of an almost flat membrane and its bending energy in the presence of inclusions as a function of their distance .",
    "in contrast to the case of vanishing tension , this interaction depends on the orientations of the inclusions with respect to the membrane plane .",
    "for oppositely oriented inclusions the interaction changes from repulsive to attractive as the separation increases , while equally oriented inclusions repel each other at all distances .",
    "this is very different from the case of vanishing lateral tension where the interaction of conical inclusions is always repulsive , independently of relative orientation .",
    "we did not consider in this study the contribution of thermal undulations of the membrane to the interaction between the inclusions @xcite . in the case of non - vanishing lateral tension",
    "this may be partially justified by the fact that the undulations are diminished by the tension .",
    "moreover , others have found for the case of zero tension that the static part of the interaction exceeds the dynamic one for @xmath97 @xcite or @xmath98 @xcite where @xmath99 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath100 is temperature .",
    "if the tension - induced forces dominate , they should lead to interesting phase behavior of embedded inclusions .",
    "for example , the attractive interaction between pairs of oppositely oriented conical inclusions may favor the formation of clusters with a regular structure where inclusions with different signs of the contact angles alternate .",
    "for an estimate of the attractive interaction one may use fig .  5 .",
    "with @xmath101 ( typical of lipid bilayers ) , @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath104 , the minimum of the interaction energy @xmath105 is roughly @xmath106 ( @xmath107 at room temperature ) . because of",
    "@xmath71 the lateral tension needed to produce @xmath108 is given by @xmath109 .",
    "for @xmath110 and @xmath101 , one finds @xmath111 which is below the known tension of lipid bilayer rupture @xcite .",
    "while our results are intuitively appealing and may be obtainable more directly , we performed a complete perturbation calculation to make sure that no terms are missed .",
    "the boundary and equilibrium conditions for the membrane with conical inclusions are central to our calculations .",
    "they resulted in a set of linear equations for the coefficients of two superimposed expansions , one for either inclusion .",
    "this method is extendable to larger number of inclusions by using similar sets of boundary conditions . in computer - aided calculation",
    "the shape of a membrane could be determined with any desired precision and for any number of inclusions .",
    "to derive the equilibrium conditions ( 4 ) we study a variation @xmath112 of the equilibrium membrane displacement @xmath113 on a circular ring s : @xmath114 around a conical inclusion . to simplify the notation we leave out indices of the polar",
    "coordinates @xmath115 .",
    "the variation is restricted by the boundary conditions ( 1 ) of the inclusion .",

    "<S> considering two rigid conical inclusions embedded in a membrane subject to lateral tension , we study the membrane - mediated interaction between these inclusions that originates from the hat - shaped membrane deformations associated with the cones . at non - vanishing lateral tensions , </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is found to depend on the orientation of the cones with respect to the membrane plane . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of inclusions of equal orientation is repulsive at all distances between them , while the inclusions of opposite orientation repel each other at small separations , but attract each other at larger ones . </S>",
    "<S> both the repulsive and attractive forces become stronger with increasing lateral tension . </S>",
    "<S> this is different from what has been predicted on the basis of the same static model for the case of vanishing lateral tension . without tension , </S>",
    "<S> the inclusions repel each other at all distances independently of their relative orientation . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that lateral tension may induce the aggregation of conical membrane inclusions . </S>"
