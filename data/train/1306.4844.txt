    "the bending rigidity is relevant for large scale fluctuations .",
    "many biopolymers such as dna , filamentous ( f- ) actin , or microtubules belong to the class of semiflexible polymers .",
    "the biological function of these polymers requires considerable mechanical rigidity ; for example , actin filaments are the main structural elements of the cytoskeleton , in which they form a network rigid enough to maintain the shape of the cell and to transmit forces",
    ". prominent examples for synthetic semiflexible polymers are polyelectrolytes at sufficiently low salt concentration @xcite or dendronized polymers @xcite , where the electrostatic repulsion of charges along the backbone or the steric interaction of side groups give rise to considerable bending rigidity .",
    "the bending rigidity of semiflexible polymers is characterized by their bending rigidity @xmath0 .",
    "the ratio of bending rigidity and thermal energy determines the persistence length @xmath1 , which is the characteristic length scale for the decay of tangent correlations @xcite .",
    "the physics of semiflexible polymers becomes qualitatively different from the physics of flexible synthetic polymers on length scales smaller than the persistence length where bending energy dominates over conformational entropy .",
    "typical biopolymer persistence lengths range from @xmath2 for dna @xcite ( at high salt concentrations ) to the @xmath3-range for f - actin @xcite or even up to the mm - range for microtubules @xcite and are , thus , comparable to typical contour lengths .",
    "polymer adsorption is the most important phase transition for single polymer chains with numerous applications @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the adsorption of a single semiflexible polymer to a planar surface and investigate , in particular , how the bending rigidity allows to control the adsorption transition , i.e. , to control the critical potential strength necessary for adsorption .",
    "relevant adsorption interactions are van der waals interactions or depletion interactions for uncharged semiflexible polymers and screened electrostatic interactions or counterion - induced interactions for charged polymers such as dna or f - actin @xcite .",
    "f - actin can also be bound via crosslinking molecules .",
    "@xcite    from a theoretical point of view , the adsorption of semiflexible polymers exhibits a rich behavior because several relevant length scales compete . for a free semiflexible polymer the persistence length @xmath4 and its contour length @xmath5 are the relevant length scales , and for @xmath6 the behavior",
    "is dominated by bending energy . in the adsorption problem ,",
    "both length scales compete with the correlation length @xmath7 of the adsorption transition and the range @xmath8 of the adsorption potential .",
    "the correlation length @xmath7 is given by the characteristic length of desorbed segments ( loops ) and diverges at the adsorption transition .",
    "if the contour length is small compared to the correlation length , @xmath9 , finite size effects are relevant and affect the critical behavior close to the adsorption transition . if the persistence length is small compared to the correlation length , @xmath10 , there is a crossover in the critical properties of the adsorption transition to those of a flexible polymer @xcite , which can only be observed close to the adsorption transition , and corrections to the critical potential strength are small .",
    "if the persistence length becomes even smaller than the potential range , @xmath11 , we expect that the critical potential strength for adsorption itself will cross over to the flexible polymer result .",
    "this crossover is the central subject of this paper .",
    "various aspects of the adsorption transition of semiflexible polymers to planar substrates by short - range potentials have been studied theoretically .",
    "an early study of semiflexible polymer adsorption by birshtein @xcite was based on an analytical transfer matrix calculation for lattice polymers .",
    "the main finding was that the critical potential strength for adsorption decreases with stiffness , i.e. , stiff polymers adsorb more easily , and that the transition sharpens with increasing stiffness but remains continuous .",
    "these findings were confirmed by numerical calculations @xcite . a decreasing critical potential strength for adsorption has also been found in off - lattice molecular dynamics simulations @xcite and monte - carlo simulations @xcite . scaling arguments for the critical potential strength for the adsorption of semiflexible polyelectrolytes",
    "@xcite indicate the same trend , whereas monte - carlo simulations on polyelectrolytes found a critical potential strength increasing with stiffness @xcite .",
    "there has also been some rigorous mathematical analysis of the binding transition onto a hard wall @xcite .",
    "adsorption of semiflexible polymers can be studied both for lattice polymers @xcite and off - lattice as in the present approach . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the dependence of the critical potential strength for adsorption on the polymer stiffness , i.e. , as a function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath12 of persistence length ( stiffness ) and potential range , which are the two basic length scales for semiflexible polymer adsorption .",
    "we will address both the flexible limit @xmath13 and the stiff limit @xmath14 . for a lattice polymer ,",
    "the lattice constant @xmath15 provides a third intrinsic length scale of the problem , which introduces lattice effects on small scales .",
    "the flexible limit is unaffected from lattice effects only if @xmath16 , which is difficult to achieve in simulations and motivates the use of an off - lattice model .",
    "frequently , transfer matrix methods @xcite have been applied to the adsorption of continuous off - lattice semiflexible polymers to planar surfaces @xcite .",
    "many transfer matrix approaches have employed a weak bending approximation ( or _ monge parametrization _ )",
    "@xcite , where it is assumed that deviations from the orientation parallel to the adsorbing surface are small .",
    "the main findings of the transfer matrix studies in refs .   were as follows : the adsorption transition is continuous for an orientation - independent adsorption potential , whereas it can become discontinuous if an additional orientation - dependence is present .",
    "all critical exponents governing the transition were determined , and analytical results for the scaling function governing the segment distribution were derived . in the present paper , we will focus on the critical potential strength for adsorption and give an analytical derivation of its value for weakly bent semiflexible polymers adsorbing on a planar surface with a short - range adsorption potential using a transfer matrix approach .",
    "we confirm our analytical results quantitatively by extensive monte - carlo simulations , which are _ not _ limited by a weak bending approximation .",
    "there are two limitations of the weak bending approximation : ( i ) if the persistence length @xmath4 becomes smaller than the potential range @xmath8 , the polymer can change orientation in the adsorbed state , and we have to use a flexible polymer model with a kuhn length @xmath17 to treat the adsorption transition .",
    "( ii ) the correlation length @xmath7 , which is closely related to the length of unbound polymer segments ( so - called loops ) , diverges upon approaching the transition . sufficiently close to the transition",
    ", @xmath7 will exceed the persistence length @xmath4 , and we have to use a flexible polymer model with a kuhn length @xmath18 to obtain the correct critical properties @xcite",
    ". the corrections for ( ii ) @xmath19 mainly affect the critical behavior in the vicinity of the adsorption transition and have already been addressed in the supporting information of ref .   .",
    "in the present paper , we will address the consequences of a crossover to a flexible limit with ( i ) @xmath11 in detail .",
    "the corrections for @xmath20 are more serious and strongly affect the value for the critical potential strength itself .",
    "this dependence can be exploited to control the adsorption of semiflexible polymers .",
    "we argue that not only stiff polymers adsorb more easily to a planar surface but also flexible polymers adsorb more easily .",
    "this has also been observed in ref .   in a transfer matrix treatment in an expansion around the flexible limit .",
    "we find that the combination of easy adsorption in both the stiff and flexible limit results in a maximum in the critical potential strength or a minimum in the critical temperature for adsorption in the intermediate range .",
    "this maximum is a result of the competition between @xmath4 and the potential range @xmath8 and is attained for @xmath21 .",
    "it is , therefore , closely connected to the problem ( i ) of the weak bending approximation explained above .",
    "we confirm the existence of a maximum in the critical adsorption potential strength as a function of the polymer rigidity by performing extensive monte - carlo simulations without any weak bending approximation .",
    "an equivalent crossover in adsorption behavior has also been observed in numerical transfer matrix studies in ref .  .",
    "the numerical transfer matrix results of ref .",
    "are in agreement with our monte - carlo simulations ( because lengths are measured in units of @xmath4 in ref .",
    "the critical potential strength for adsorption does not show the existence of a maximum as a function of polymer stiffness ) .",
    "we derive two different interpolation functions , which describe this crossover behavior of the critical potential strength for adsorption accurately over the whole range of polymer rigidities .",
    "our interpolation functions are based on exact analytical results that we obtain in the stiff limit and differ from the interpolation function proposed in ref .  .",
    "the existence of a maximum in the critical potential strength for adsorption has interesting and potentially useful consequences for applications because tuning the polymer rigidity versus the potential range allows to control the adsorption threshold .",
    "for example , tuning @xmath4 or @xmath8 to match each other can prevent adsorption . another attractive option to control the adsorption transition are modifications of the adsorbing surface geometry .",
    "adsorption of polyelectrolytes has been studied for various different geometries including spherical @xcite , cylindrical @xcite or pore @xcite geometries .",
    "because semiflexible polymers have a bending rigidity , we will explore adsorption control by additional _",
    "curvature _ of the adsorbing surface .",
    "then , the adsorption free energy gain will compete with the additional bending energy imposed by the substrate curvature such that systematic variation of the persistence length will also allow to control the adsorption .",
    "we will study three different types of curved substrate geometries , which are an adsorbing sphere , an adsorbing washboard and a checkered washboard surface as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] . for such curved substrates",
    "the radii of curvature will set additional length scales competing with the persistence length @xmath4 and allowing to control the adsorption threshold .",
    "the spherical adsorption geometry is relevant for complexation of dna or other polyelectrolytes with oppositely charged colloids or histone proteins @xcite . in refs .   and",
    ", a minimum of the critical charge for a wrapping transition has been found as a function of the electrostatic screening length using numerical minimization of bending and electrostatic energies . here",
    ", we include thermal fluctuations in the adsorption problem .",
    "based on the results for the planar geometry we can make analytical estimates for a spherical adsorber , which also exhibit a local minimum in the critical potential strength for adsorption as a function of the potential range due to a crossover from thermally driven to bending energy driven desorption .",
    "these results are in quantitative agreement with our monte - carlo simulations for this geometry",
    ".    structured adsorbing substrates can give rise to interesting shape transitions of semiflexible polymers in the adsorbed state @xcite and also give rise to activated dynamics of polymers @xcite .",
    "here , we focus on the influence of the surface structure on the adsorption transition itself for a washboard and checkered washboard geometry .",
    "adsorption of semiflexible polymers on washboard structures has been considered analytically in ref .  .",
    "using scaling arguments and monte - carlo simulations , we find a single adsorption transition for a washboard surface structure with a critical adsorption strength , which exhibits a rich behavior as a function of polymer stiffness : whereas we have a single local maximum in the critical adsorption strength as a function of polymer stiffness for a planar substrate , we find two maxima and one local minimum for a washboard surface structure . for a checkered washboard surface structure the local minimum is suppressed again and we find a single maximum , which is broadened as compared to a planar substrate .",
    "we identify the range of persistence lengths , for which the adsorption threshold can be effectively changed and , thus , controlled by the substrate curvature .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the theoretical and simulation model for semiflexible polymers , and the monte - carlo simulation technique .",
    "the paper is then divided into two parts .",
    "first , we study the adsorption onto a flat surface .",
    "we focus on the critical potential strength and its dependence on polymer rigidity , which is determined analytically by scaling arguments and transfer matrix calculations and numerically from monte - carlo simulations . in the second part",
    ", we investigate adsorption onto curved substrates for a sphere , a washboard and a checkered washboard surface . using scaling arguments and monte - carlo simulations ,",
    "we determine the critical potential strength for these surfaces as a function of polymer rigidity .",
    "this allows us to predict how adsorption of semiflexible polymers can be controlled by the curvatures of the surface structure .",
    "finally , we relate our results to experiments on polyelectrolyte adsorption .",
    "the fundamental model to describe freely fluctuating inextensible semiflexible polymers on all length scales is the kratky - porod model , also known as _ worm - like chain model _ @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a polymer with contour @xmath22 , which is parametrized by the arc length @xmath23 , is given by the bending energy @xmath24 = \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\int_0^{l } \\mathrm{d}s        \\left(\\partial_s^2 { { \\bf r}}(s)\\right)^2 ,     \\label{eq : ham_wlc }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the bending rigidity and @xmath5 the contour length of the polymer .",
    "the persistence length @xmath25 of the worm - like chain is defined as the decay length of tangent correlations in @xmath26 spatial dimensions and is given by @xcite @xmath27 in the following , we will use use @xmath4 to denote the three - dimensional persistence length , @xmath28 .",
    "the worm - like chain model contains the two limiting cases of flexible polymers for @xmath29 and rod - like polymers for @xmath30 .",
    "adsorption by an attractive planar or curved surface is modeled by a potential @xmath31 per polymer length , which only depends on the coordinate @xmath32 perpendicular to the surface .",
    "the surface is at @xmath33 ; for a planar surface in the xy - plane , the coordinate @xmath32 is the cartesian coordinate @xmath34 .",

    "the potential range @xmath8 is comparable to the polymer thickness or the debye - hckel screening length , respectively . for polyelectrolytes",
    ", we have @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the bjerrum length , @xmath43 is the area per unit charge on the surface , @xmath44 is the length per unit charge on the polymer and @xmath45 is the inverse debye screening length depending on the total concentration @xmath46 of ( monovalent ) counter - ions @xcite .",
    "the polyelectrolyte persistence length is given by the sum of the bare mechanical persistence length @xmath47 and an electrostatic contribution , @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "whereas our findings for the critical potential strength @xmath49 for adsorption will depend on microscopic features of the attractive potential such as the potential range , results for critical exponents are expected to apply to all short - ranged interaction potentials , i.e. , to all potentials which decay faster than @xmath50 for large separations @xmath34 .",
    "we also expect the parameter dependence of the critical potential strength for all short - range adhesion potentials , which have only one characteristic length scale @xmath8 for the potential range and one energy scale @xmath51 for the potential strength , to be identical to our generic square - well potential .",
    "numerical prefactors can vary .",
    "therefore , our results for the parameter dependence of the critical potential strength for adsorption should also apply , for example , to polyelectrolytes using the above identifications @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "a weakly bent semiflexible polymer without overhangs has a preferred orientation parallel to the adsorbing surface . for a planar surface",
    "this allows for a particularly simple _ monge parametrization _ by choosing the @xmath54-coordinate along the the preferred orientation and @xmath55 , which leads to @xmath56 = \\mathcal{h}_b[z(x ) ] + \\mathcal{h}_{ad}[z(x ) ]       \\nonumber\\\\       & \\approx \\int_0^{l } \\mathrm{d}x\\ , \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } ( \\partial^2_x z)^2 +         \\int_0^{l } \\mathrm{d}x\\ ,   v_a(z(x ) )      \\label{eq : ham_monge }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath57 assuming weakly bent configurations .",
