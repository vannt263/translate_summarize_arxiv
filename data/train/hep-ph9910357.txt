    "there are two main problems in neutrino physics .",
    "first is the problem of neutrino masses , which in the light of present data @xcite seems to be solved .",
    "neutrinos are massive .",
    "the second is that of the neutrino nature . as massive",
    "they can be dirac ( with particles and antiparticles being different objects : @xmath2 ) or majorana ( with particles and antiparticles being the same , just as for photons : @xmath3 ) . an experimental distinction between these",
    "two seems to be much more complicated than the confirmation of non - vanishing mass . while experimentalists are trying to find some way of doing it , theorists have no doubts .",
    "they widely believe in the majorana nature @xcite .",
    "almost all extensions of the standard model ( sm ) predict it .",
    "the only way to have dirac neutrinos is to impose lepton number conservation .",
    "however , there is no particular reason for this , since it is not a fundamental quantity like the electric charge .",
    "if we do , we immediately run into trouble .",
    "let us mention only a loss of the natural ` see - saw ' mechanism to explain the smallness of the neutrino mass .",
    "theoretical reasons aside , the scientific method obliges us to perform experimental studies , that would falsify either option .",
    "so then , why is it difficult ? naively one might think it to be rather easy .",
    "imagine for example , neutrinos from @xmath4 decay ( @xmath5 ) scattering on a nuclear target .",
    "the result is a flux of @xmath6 ( antineutrinos @xmath7 coming from @xmath8 decay ( @xmath9 always produce antiparticles @xmath10 ) .",
    "unfortunately the lepton number l ( l(@xmath11)= + 1 , l(@xmath11)=@xmath12 ) is not the only property characterizing neutrinos .",
    "we know also from experiment @xcite that neutrinos and antineutrinos have opposite helicity ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) .",
    "therefore , we are not able to state which is responsible for @xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) production , lepton number conservation or helicity . in the first case the left - handed neutrino fields @xmath15 @xmath16",
    "are composed of two different operators ( see @xcite for a detailed definition ) . @xmath17 which annihilates particles has negative helicity and @xmath18 which creates particles has positive helicity .    for a massless majorana field",
    "@xmath19 only one operator @xmath20 appears @xmath21 in order to check whether lepton number conservation @xmath22 or particle helicity @xmath23 is responsible for @xmath6(@xmath10 ) production , we have to compare neutrino interactions in the same helicity states @xmath24 or @xmath25 unfortunately , the visible neutrino interactions are such that only particles in the states a(- ) and b(+ ) are produced .",
    "no neutrinos in the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 appear in known experiments .    in the next section",
    "we would like to show the connection between the presence ( or absence ) of the states given in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) with the symmetries of the theory .",
    "next in chapter 3 examples which explain the origin of the experimental difficulties of discerning dirac from majorana neutrinos are given .",
    "the main background being the small mass of neutrinos which causes that they are produced as highly relativistic particles and their visible left - handed interaction .",
    "it is common belief that the first place to search is the neutrinoless double @xmath28 decay @xmath29 of nuclei . unfortunately up to now such a decay has not been found and experimental data gives lower bounds on @xmath30 decay modes of various nuclei .",
    "these in turn lead to the limit @xcite on the so - called effective neutrino mass @xmath31 @xmath32 there are plans to increase the sensitivity of the bound(s ) down to 0.01 or even 0.001 ev @xcite . if @xmath33 the neutrinos are massive majorana ( dirac ) particles . currently , however , the bound ( 5 ) alone is not conclusive .",
    "there are nevertheless different experiments from which independent information on the neutrino mixing matrix elements @xmath34 and masses @xmath35 can be inferred .",
    "then , we can check whether the bound ( 5 ) is satisfied or not . if not , neutrinos are dirac particles .",
    "if it is satisfied , no conclusion can be drawn .",
    "such an analysis is performed in chapter ( 4 ) . finally , in chapter ( 5 ) the conclusions are given .",
    "we would like to explain how the particle content of a theory is connected with its symmetries .",
    "we believe up to now @xcite , that the fundamental symmetry of any theory which describes elementary particle interactions is lorentz invariance .",
    "this statement means precisely that the theory must be invariant under the proper orthochronous group of lorentz transformations @xmath36 . for massive particles , they mix states with all helicities , for massless , helicity is lorentz invariant .",
    "so , from @xmath36 invariance it follows that :    * for massive particles @xmath37 with spin j all states    @xmath38    must be present in the theory    * for massless spin j particles @xmath39 only one state    @xmath40    must be introduced .    for example",
    ", it is possible to built a theory which has @xmath36 invariance with three helicity states of the @xmath41 @xmath42 with no @xmath43 and a photon of one polarization e.g@xmath44 or a neutrino in the state @xmath45 .",
    "the next symmetry is invariance under the cpt transformation @xcite which changes particles into antiparticles and helicity @xmath46    @xmath47    in any theory with cpt symmetry , particles and antiparticles with opposite helicities must exist . in our example",
    "this means that @xmath48 particles with @xmath49 , and an antiphoton with @xmath50 , and antineutrinos with @xmath51 must be present .",
    "there are theories like qed where also the separate symmetries c , p and t hold .",
    "the helicity states transform as @xmath52 @xmath53 and @xmath54 for massive particles these symmetries do not introduce new necessary particle states above those already present because of lorentz invariance and cpt symmetry . for massless particles , however , p leads to the existence of particle ( antiparticle ) states with opposite helicities .",
    "once more in our example there has to be a photon and an antiphoton .",
    "now we can go back to our previous statement : in order to determine the nature of neutral objects we need to compare the interaction of particles and antiparticles in the same helicity states .",
    "@xmath55 in a theory with c , p and t symmetry :    \\(i ) such states exist for massive and massless particles    \\(ii ) from c symmetry particles and antiparticles interact in the same way so there is no way to distinguish them .",
    "this means that in those fully symmetric theories , there are only majorana neutral particles .",
    "that is why photons must be majorana particles in qed .",
    "all looks different in theories where c , p , t symmetries do not hold ( like in the weak interactions ) .    for massive particles two states ( eq .",
    "( 12 ) exist and we can compare their interactions .",
    "particles and antiparticles in the same helicity states can interact ( i ) in different ways or ( ii ) identically .    in case ( i ) :    * some additive quantum number exists , which differentiate particles from antiparticles , * particles and antiparticles are not the same , * it is the case of massive dirac neutrinos ( described by bispinors ) with lepton number conservation .",
    "@xmath56 in the case ( ii ) : * additive quantum numbers can not exist , * particles and antiparticles are not indistinguishable , they are majorana objects , * there are two important examples of such particles : the @xmath57 gauge boson , and massive majorana neutrinos described by majorana bispinors @xmath58 for massless particles the symmetries do not require the existence of both states in eq .",
    "it is possible to built theories where particles and antiparticles in the same helicity state ( i ) do not exist or ( ii ) are introduced .",
    "+ in the same case ( i ) : * the discussion about dirac or majorana nature of such particles is meaningless , there is nothing to compare , * in the case of spin 1/2 objects there is a kinematical theorem @xcite , which proves that weyl neutrinos are identical with massless majorana neutrinos .",
    "+ in the case ( ii ) : * two spinors @xmath59 and @xmath60 are introduced . as in the l - r symmetric model ,",
    "four states described by @xmath61(@xmath62 and @xmath63 annihilation operators exist , * objects @xmath61(@xmath62 and @xmath63 can interact in different ways so we have massless dirac neutrinos ( or if cp is conserved , two majorana neutrinos with opposite @xmath64 parities ) * objects @xmath61(@xmath62 and @xmath63 interact in the same way and we have two identical massless majorana neutrinos ( these majorana neutrinos have the same @xmath64 parity ) .",
    "there are two main reasons , which cause that practically it is impossible , at least with the present experimental precision to determine nature of neutrinos @xcite .",
    "firstly , the created neutrinos are usually relativistic @xmath65 . on the other hand , cross sections for neutrino interaction are proportional to the energy e , so that nonrelativistic neutrinos interact with matter very weakly .",
    "secondly , visible neutrino interactions are either left - handed @xmath66 for gauge bosons or proportional to neutrino mass for scalar particles ( @xmath67 for higgs particles ) .",
    "the forthcoming examples will demonstrate these problems .",
    "let us assume that a beam of muon neutrinos with helicity @xmath68 , scatters on a nuclear target . to be more general we consider the neutrino charged current interaction to be of the form",
    "@xmath69 w_\\mu ^{+}+h.c.\\ ] ] with a left - handed @xmath70 and a hypothetical right - handed @xmath71 part .",
    "dirac neutrinos generate only @xmath6 s ( with helicity @xmath72 ) @xmath73 with the amplitude proportional to @xmath74 ^{1/2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & a_r^ { * } \\left [ \\left ( e_\\mu + 2h_\\mu p_\\mu \\right ) \\left ( e_\\nu + 2h_\\nu p_\\nu \\right ) \\right ] ^{1/2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 ( @xmath76 is the energy and momentum of the muons ( neutrinos ) .",
    "majorana neutrinos generate @xmath6 s with exactly the same amplitude eq .",
    "( 17 ) and @xmath10 s .",

    "the situation seems at first sight to be even more promising .",
    "there are two characteristic features , which are completely different for dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "\\(i ) the vector current @xmath81 , for majorana neutrinos + and    \\(ii ) majorana neutrinos , as identical particles , need symmetrization .",
    "let us consider shortly both of them .",
    "the respective neutral current interactions are of the form @xmath82 and @xmath83 despite this striking difference , both cases are again indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "let us consider the measurement of the total cross section for inclusive production ( fig.2 ) @xmath84    the amplitudes are given by @xmath85 and @xmath86 d_{\\mu \\nu } b^\\nu , \\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the @xmath88 propagator and @xmath89 describes the @xmath88 interaction with nuclei @xmath90    both amplitudes look different , but if we approximate them for relativistic neutrinos @xmath91 , with the relation @xmath92 and @xmath93 we find in both cases @xmath94 where @xmath95 for dirac and @xmath96 for majorana neutrinos .",
    "the measurement of the total cross section @xmath97 gives one number @xmath98 and we are not able to say whether @xmath99 or @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , even if the neutral current interaction is so different for dirac and majorana neutrinos , it can not be used to distinguish them .    to see possible differences in the behavior of dirac and majorana neutrinos , which could follow from the symmetrization procedure",
    "let us consider the process @xmath100 we suppose that the measurement of the angular distribution of final neutrinos ( of course in the case that such a distribution is measured which is not the case up to now ) is the simplest way to find their character : if the angular distribution has forward - backward symmetry the neutrinos are majorana particles if not , dirac neutrinos were produced .    to check whether the above statement is true , let us calculate the helicity amplitudes ( for simplicity we neglect the electron and neutrino masses)(see for details ref .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) . for majorana neutrinos ,",
    "four helicity amplitudes do not vanish , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are helicities of the electron ( positron ) and the final neutrino ( antineutrino ) .",
    "whereas , there are only two amplitudes for dirac neutrinos @xmath105 if we calculate the unpolarized cross section @xmath106 we find out that there is difference between the dirac and the majorana cases . the important feature of a detector , that does not measure helicity is that it also is not able to distinguish a neutrino from an antineutrino ( fig .",
    "3 ) . therefore we have to add the cross section for dirac neutrinos and antineutrinos . due to the formulae : @xmath107 and @xmath108 the final result will be now symmetric .    for the total cross section",
    "we recover once more the equivalence between both types of neutrinos . in order not to take into account the same spin configuration two times",
    ", we have to integrate the majorana cross section only over half of the full solid angle and we have @xmath109 there is only one terrestrial experiment , which currently promises to state whether neutrinos are majorana or dirac particles .",
    "it is the neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay of nuclei @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xmath110 there are many different mechanisms which could be responsible for @xmath111 decay @xcite .",
    "the most important one is massive majorana neutrino exchange @xcite ( see fig .",
    "( 4 ) ) .",
    "it has been proved that independently of the mechanism which governs the @xmath112 there is a generic relation between the amplitude of @xmath1 decay and the majorana mass term for neutrinos @xcite .",
    "if any of these two quantities vanishes , the other one vanishes , too , and vice versa if one of them is not zero , the other also differs from zero .",
    "taking into account the most obvious mechanism from fig.4 the @xmath113 amplitude is given by @xmath114 where @xmath115 describes the nuclear transition and @xmath116is given by eq.(5 ) .",
    "many experiments on the search for @xmath1 decay of different nuclei are going on at present .",
    "unfortunately , up to now such a decay has not been found and experimentalists can only give a lower bound on the @xmath117 decay modes of various nuclei .",
    "the most stringent limit was found in the germanium heidelberg - moscow experiment .",
    "their latest result on the half - life time @xmath118 is @xcite @xmath119 from which the bound on @xmath120 ( eq . ( 5 ) ) has been found .",
    "such results alone give no chance to conclude about the nature of neutrinos .",
    "there are however other experimental data on mixing matrix elements @xmath34 and masses which are independent of the neutrino character .",
    "this information comes from flavor oscillation experiments ( see appendix ) tritium @xmath0 decay and cosmology .",
    "we can use this data and check whether the bound ( eq . ( 5 ) is satisfied .",
    "if it is , the results are still not conclusive .",
    "if however the @xmath34 and @xmath121 are such that the value of @xmath31 is greater than the present bound , neutrinos must have dirac character .",
    "the discussion which follows depends on the number of light neutrinos .",
    "three such neutrinos are necessary to explain solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite anomalies .",

    "they are presented in fig .",
    "5 .    in addition",
    "the total scale for neutrino masses is not fixed and different scenarios are possible ( fig .",

    "there are squares of @xmath34 s and large cancellations are possible . from other experiments we have only information about the modulus , not about phases .",
    "if we also take into account , that the scale of masses is not known the method is not powerful enough . despite of that , in some cases the results can be conclusive .",
    "for example , for almost degenerate neutrinos if we know that two elements of mixing matrix are small , then the third must be large , close to 1 . in this case , independently of the possible cancellations , @xmath31 is large ( @xmath152 and can be greater than the present bound on @xmath1 decay . then we conclude that neutrinos must be dirac particles . for details and discussions of different scenarios we refer to @xcite .",
    "as ( i ) the sm works very well and no signal about non standard neutrino interaction is seen , and    \\(ii ) in any of the astrophysical sources and terrestrial experiments neutrinos are produced with an energy much larger than their mass ,    it is extremely difficult to find an experimental signal which would inform us about the nature of neutrinos .",
    "there is only one terrestrial experimental test that can reveal the majorana character of neutrinos - the neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay .",
    "unfortunately , experimental groups placed only the upper limit on the @xmath1 decay half life time .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana particles , probably the next experiments which measure @xmath31 up to 0.01 ev or 0.001 ev have a chance to measure it .",
    "if neutrinos are dirac particles we should get a signal about it by confronting the @xmath1 bound with independent information about masses and mixing matrix elements .",
    "the present experimental precision is not good enough to find the answer .",
    "however , we are able to get some partial information e.g. if @xmath147 msw mechanism describes the solar neutrino deficit , and almost degenerate neutrinos have @xmath153 ev then they must be dirac particles . if the future gemini experiment still gives only a bound on @xmath116 the next solar neutrino measurements ( sno and borexino ) have a chance to state that neutrinos are dirac particles .",
    "we would like to clarify what the formulae for flavor oscillation @xmath154 and effective neutrino mass @xmath116 look like for dirac neutrinos .    the mass term of n dirac neutrinos is@xmath155 where @xmath156 is an arbitrary @xmath157 matrix,@xmath158 the @xmath156 matrix can be diagonalized by the biunitary transformation@xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are the @xmath157 unitary matrices .      where the @xmath164 matrix u is@xmath165 in the mass eigenstate basis for charged leptons the left - handed charged current interaction @xmath166 can be written in the form@xmath167 where@xmath168 and two majorana bispinors @xmath169 and @xmath170 correspond to the same mass eigenvalue @xmath121 of the matrix ( 49)@xmath171 now the effective neutrino mass is @xmath172 for the probability that a neutrino born with flavor @xmath173 will have flavor @xmath0 after traveling distance @xmath174 we get@xmath175    we see that @xmath176 looks exactly the same for @xmath177 dirac and n majorana neutrino oscillation",
    "the only difference is the number of cp violating phases in mixing matrices @xmath178 in both cases .",
    "they are @xmath179 for dirac neutrinos and @xmath180 for majorana neutrino mixing .",
