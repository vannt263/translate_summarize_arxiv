    "recent experimental results from the observations of solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrinos have provided compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations @xcite . until recently the evidence for neutrino oscillation was indirect , with a small window still available for other possibilities such as neutrino decay .",
    "the latest results from the super - kamiokande ( super - k ) collaboration @xcite , presenting the evidence for an  oscillation minimum \" in the observation of atmospheric neutrinos , seem to provide for the first time clear and unambiguous evidence for the oscillation hypothesis @xcite and hence of non - zero ( and different ) neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "recently , data is also available from the long - baseline experiment k2k@xcite .",
    "clearly the focus from now on will be to determine precisely the mixing parameters and mass squared differences apart from the observation of the oscillation pattern beyond the first minimum .",
    "an important question that still remains open is the hierarchy of the masses . within the three neutrino mixing framework ,",
    "the results on solar neutrinos prefer the dominant mass eigenstates in @xmath6 to have the hierarchy @xmath7 so that the mass - squared difference @xmath8 .",
    "the sign of the other mass - squared difference @xmath4 ( equivalently @xmath9 since it is so much larger than @xmath10 ) is not known .",
    "the issue of the neutrino mass hierarchy ( and measurement of the ( 13 ) mixing angle ) was discussed by tabarelli de fatis @xcite through a measurement of muon neutrino and anti - neutrino events in a magnetised iron calorimeter . in a recent analysis ,",
    "palomares - ruiz and petcov@xcite have discussed the resolution of the issue of hierarchy of neutrino masses in magnetised iron calorimeters by looking at the ratio ( and difference ) of events with @xmath11 and @xmath12 due to atmospheric muon neutrino and anti - neutrino interactions .    in principle",
    "an iron calorimeter ( ical ) detector with charge identification capability as has been proposed by the monolith @xcite , minos @xcite and ical / ino @xcite collaborations , with a mass of at least 3050 ktons , can resolve this issue ; the question at hand is one of feasibility and exposure times .",
    "in this paper we focus on a new _ difference asymmetry _ that is especially suited to probe the mass hierarchy .",
    "this asymmetry is constructed from observables involving the detection of muon neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) through charged current interactions with muons in the final state . in an earlier work @xcite it was shown that the direct and inverted hierarchies could be discriminated by studying the _ magnitude _ of certain asymmetries ; in contrast , the new asymmetry probes the hierarchy issue via its _ sign _ , which is surely a more robust signature .",
    "provided @xmath13 , an ical detector is sensitive to the mass hierarchy .",
    "a result with a significance greater than 90% cl requires large exposures of more than 500 kton - years as well as good energy and angular resolution of the detected muons ( better than 15% ) , especially for small @xmath1 . hence obtaining definitive results with such",
    "a detector is difficult , unless @xmath1 turns out to be large .",
    "furthermore , such an asymmetry is not as sensitive to the magnitude of @xmath1 ; in the case of a positive result it may only place a lower bound on this parameter .",
    "the issue of @xmath1 therefore may not be resolved in such detectors using atmospheric neutrinos alone .    in section 2",
    "we present some details of the oscillation probabilities and their dependence on masses and mixing parameters after summarising the status of their determination within the three neutrino frame - work .",
    "some features of these probabilities within some reasonable approximation such as single - scale dominance are presented in a semi - analytic treatment . the new asymmetry and its sensitivity to the hierarchy",
    "are discussed here as also the crucial question of binning the data to maximise this asymmetry . in section 3",
    "we analyse the results numerically for the event rates both together and separately for different charged lepton final states using the nuance code @xcite for atmospheric neutrinos distributed according to the 3-d honda flux @xcite .",
    "we discuss the sensitivity of the ical detector to the hierarchy of neutrino masses .",
    "this obviously depends on the mixing parameters .",
    "we highlight the sensitivity to the two unknown parameters , the ( 13 ) mixing angle and the sign of @xmath4 . in section 4",
    "we generate events using the nuance neutrino generator and study the impact of statistical errors and fluctuations on the rates and asymmetries .",
    "the effect of detector resolution and cuts on the observables is also discussed . in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "an understanding of the gamut of data from solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrinos requires a mixing scheme with at least three neutrinos in which the neutrino flavour states @xmath14 , @xmath15 are linear superpositions of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with masses @xmath18 : @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the @xmath21 unitary matrix which may be parametrised as @xcite ( ignoring majorana phases ) : @xmath22 here @xmath23 , @xmath24 etc . , and @xmath25 denotes the cp violating ( dirac ) phase . by definition ,",

    "a combined analysis @xcite of the data from all the experiments gives the following best fits to the oscillation parameters :    * a combination of solar neutrino experiments and the kamland reactor experiment gives @xmath31 with the best - fit values given by @xmath32 and @xmath33 . note in particular that @xmath34 . * a combination of atmospheric neutrino experiments and the k2k experiment gives @xmath35 with the best - fit values given by @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",

    "inclusion of matter effects on the neutrino oscillation probabilities has a complicated dependence on these parameters ; furthermore , the oscillation probability can only be computed numerically using a reference model for the variation of earth s density .",
    "before we present the exact numerical results , we first discuss a simplified analytical model in vacuum and matter .      in order to focus on the issues involved and their disentanglement",
    "we first discuss the vacuum oscillations ( actually the muon neutrino survival ) probabilities .",
    "the survival probability of a muon neutrino of energy @xmath40 ( in gev ) after traversing a distance @xmath41 ( in km ) is given by @xmath42 ^ 2   \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{1.27\\delta_{21}l}{e}\\right ) - [ 2u_{\\mu 2}u_{\\mu 3}]^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{1.27\\delta_{32}l}{e } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad - [ 2u_{\\mu 1}u_{\\mu 3}]^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{1.27\\delta_{31}l}{e } \\right)~ , \\label{p3nu}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected the cp violating phase .",

    "we have also shown the two generation oscillation probability , @xmath48 which has been widely used to fit @xmath49 and @xmath50 from data .",
    "notice that the three generation formula reduces to the two generation one only after setting @xmath51 and @xmath52 . even though there are two oscillating terms ( frequencies ) controlling the survival probability , the value of the probability at small @xmath44 is dominated by the last two terms in eq .  [ p3nu ] . in turn",
    ", this implies that the first observable probability minimum is roughly independent of both @xmath10 and @xmath1 , even for @xmath1 as large as the chooz limit . at larger values of @xmath44 ,",
    "when @xmath53 becomes large , the subdominant frequency controlled by @xmath10 has substantial effect .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ vac ] where both the two - flavour and three - flavour probabilities are plotted as a function of @xmath44 . in fact , for very large @xmath44 , and for this typical set of oscillation parameters , the vacuum probability @xmath54 averages to @xmath55 and not to @xmath56 as is the case for two generation mixing .    notice that the probabilities in vacuum are the same for both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos and depend only on the absolute value of the mass - squared differences .",
    "however , the inclusion of three flavours automatically turns on matter effects which alter these vacuum results ; we now examine the modification of these expressions due to matter effects .      in order to simplify the analysis",
    ", we first consider the propagation of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos produced in the atmosphere in a slab of constant density @xmath57 ( in gms / cc)@xcite . in this case",
    ", we can retain the same expressions as in vacuum for the probabilities , see eq .",
    "[ p3nu ] , but replace the mass - squared differences and mixing angles by the corresponding matter - modified effective values obtained by diagonalising the matter dependent matrix ( hamiltonian ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 here @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the fermi constant and electron number density in matter and @xmath57 is the matter density .",
    "further simplification arises because @xmath62 and we can treat the propagation in matter as a one mass - scale problem involving only @xmath63 .",
    "the matter dependent mixing angle @xmath64 may be approximately written as @xmath65 the condition for  resonance \" in the @xmath66 channel is given by @xmath67 which roughly translates to the condition , @xmath68 .",
    "we note in passing that the resonance in the ( 12 ) sector for atmospheric neutrinos has a very different character from its solar counterpart .",
    "for example , for energies above 1 gev , the resonance occurs at extremely small densities , even in the atmosphere itself for some energies !",
    "furthermore , the resonance width which is determined by @xmath69 is rather broad , with the tail extending below @xmath70 so that the effect of matter in this sector on both neutrinos and anti - neutrinos will be roughly similar .",
    "this also implies that @xmath71 is rather small for neutrinos or anti - neutrinos of few gev energy even in low density regions such as the earth s mantle  in fact at high densities and energies , we have @xmath72 so that one can neglect the term depending on @xmath10 for multi - gev atmospheric neutrino propagation in earth matter .",
    "indeed the same argument also holds for anti - neutrinos since the equation above .",
    "actually , @xmath73 can be of the order of unity for atmospheric neutrinos ; it is the smallness of the _ coefficient _ of this term that allows it to be dropped . ]",
    "holds for them as well .",
    "the effect of matter on the angle @xmath1 is non - trivial and is given by @xmath74 the resonance condition in the @xmath75 channel is then given by @xmath76 with a width @xmath77 .",
    "since @xmath78 is small , the resonance is rather sharp .",
    "this condition is satisfied for range of values @xmath79 for @xmath80 ev@xmath46 .",

    "@xmath97 is the 2-generation muon neutrino survival probability that is independent of matter effects as well as @xmath94 .",
    "the matter dependence appears in the remaining terms , where @xmath98 notice that the survival probability for the anti - neutrinos , @xmath99 , is given by the replacement @xmath100 in @xmath101 .",
    "both probabilities are invariant under @xmath102 .",
    "several important points emerge from this analysis :    * as was noticed in the analysis of the vacuum probabilities with three flavours , there are two mass scales and their associated frequencies .",
    "even though one of the scales is small in magnitude , @xmath103 , it does make an impact on the survival probability due to the large @xmath44 available ; this happens because a large range of @xmath44 is available for atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "this makes the 3-flavour results differ strongly from the 2-flavour ones in the large @xmath44 region , in the vacuum case .",
    "* the matter effect however effectively removes one of these frequencies controlled by @xmath10 such that the oscillations are controlled by the frequency determined by @xmath4 and to a lesser extent by the matter term @xmath90 . in other words ,",
    "the deviation of the 3-flavour probability from the 2-flavour one at large @xmath44 disappears when matter effects are turned on .",
    "the residual matter effect in atmospheric neutrinos is thus a sub - leading effect .",
    "* thus the matter dependent @xmath101 and @xmath104 resemble the two - generation probability curve shown in fig .",
    "[ vac ] rather than the three generation one .",
    "in fact the first dip is almost completely unaltered by the matter effects , and the average behaviour for large @xmath44 is similar to the two - generation case .",
    "this in fact justifies the attempts to get bounds on @xmath49 and @xmath105 using fits to the super - k data within the two - flavour oscillation formalism .",
    "* therefore the sensitivity to @xmath1 and the sign of @xmath4 are hidden in the sub - leading effects which show up in the oscillation frequency , the width and the amplitude after the first dip , and are maximal for intermediate values of @xmath44 .",
    "the matter effect is more pronounced for ( anti-)neutrinos in the case of the ( inverted ) direct hierarchy , since the amplitude of the matter - dependent term is enhanced ( decreased ) when @xmath4 and @xmath90 have the same ( opposite ) sign , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ pmm ] .",
    "all of the above statements apply appropriately ( by interchanging the matter effects for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos ) for both the direct and inverted hierarchies . this _ exchange symmetry _",
    "will however be broken once the cross - sections are taken into account since the neutrino cross - sections are on the average a factor of two more than the anti - neutrino cross - sections .",
    "since matter effects are enhanced for neutrinos in the case of the direct hierarchy , such a hierarchy will be more favourable for detection due to the larger events sample for the same exposure time .",
    "the arguments of the previous section clearly indicate that the main effect of matter on the survival probability is to reduce it to a single frequency ( which however is not a constant since it depends both on energy and the density ) oscillation , whereas in vacuum there are clearly two well - separated oscillations .",
    "the inclusion of matter effects through a 3-flavour analysis is complicated by an additional energy dependence . while the survival probability in the 2-flavour case depends only on the ratio @xmath106 , that in 3-flavours depends explicitly on both @xmath107 and @xmath40 , the latter through the matter term .",
    "the experimental observable is the event rate in the detector .",
    "the fully differential event rate for neutrinos of flavour @xmath108 to be detected is given by the general expression : @xmath109 where @xmath106 and @xmath110 is the total interaction cross - section for the @xmath108 type neutrino to interact with the detector material . here",
    "@xmath111 is the conversion probability of a neutrino of flavour @xmath112 to a flavour @xmath108 .",
    "the flux - dependent term @xmath113 is obtained from the doubly - differential neutrino ( or anti - neutrino ) flux of flavour @xmath108 , @xmath114 , which is a function of the energy @xmath40 and zenith ( actually nadir ) angle @xmath115 , by multiplying with a suitable jacobean factor .",
    "the factor @xmath116 is the detector dependent factor measured in units of kton - years .",
    "the detector is assumed to be mainly made up of magnetised iron with active detector elements . in the monolith and ical / ino proposals , the active detector elements are glass resistive plate gas filled chambers ( rpcs ) . in either of these proposals",
    "the detector mass is almost entirely ( @xmath117 98% ) due to its iron content .",
    "we will be interested here in _",
    "event ratios _ ; hence the factor @xmath116 and other actual detector details are not necessary for the analysis in this section . however , we assume that the detector is capable of identifying the charge of the muons in the final state with good precision",
    ".    the distance of propagation @xmath41 of the neutrino from the point of production to the detector is obtained from @xmath118 where @xmath119 corresponds to neutrinos reaching the detector vertically downwards after a distance @xmath120 which is the average height above the surface of the earth at which the atmospheric neutrinos are produced .",
    "we take this to be about 15 kms , as is the convention . here",
    "@xmath121 is the radius of the earth .",

    "however , due to the smallness of the ( 13 ) mixing angle , @xmath1 , the contribution of @xmath124 is very small and is maximum near large @xmath44 where it is about 1020% ( 5% ) for neutrinos ( anti - neutrinos ) .",
    "the event rate is expressed as a function of @xmath107 , averaged over a bin width that will be appropriately chosen to maximise the sensitivity to the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "the expression given in eq .",
    "[ eventb ] is the best case scenario since the integration is over the neutrino or anti - neutrino energy .",
    "we discuss the effect of including the detector resolution functions in the next section .    in order to proceed",
    "further we also distinguish between the up - coming and down - going neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) .",
    "it is obvious that the down - going particles travel a much smaller path - length of @xmath125 km in matter .",
    "hence effects of oscillation are expected to be negligible for these neutrinos .",
    "a useful measure of oscillations is the ratio of up - coming to down - going neutrinos with nadir / zenith angles interchanged .",
    "this is clear from fig .",
    "[ updown ] .",
    "the fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos from directions @xmath126 and @xmath127 are expected to be similar in the absence of oscillations , especially for larger energies , @xmath128 few gev . since the path - length traversed , @xmath41 ,",
    "is related to @xmath126 as @xmath129 ( see eq .  [ ldef ] ) , the replacement @xmath130 effectively changes the sign of the second term in the equation above , thus taking , for instance , a down - going neutrino to an up - coming one .",
    "the ratio of events in the up - down directions for a given @xmath131 , therefore , reflects the asymmetry of the up - down fluxes , due to oscillations .",
    "we define @xcite @xmath132 where @xmath133 and the number of up - coming ( u ) or down - going ( d ) events is calculated using eq .  [ eventb ] .",
    "similarly @xmath134 defines the corresponding up - down ratio for anti - neutrinos .",
    "since the effect of oscillations on the denominator is small , the ratio @xmath135 is effectively the ratio of oscillated to unoscillated events with the same @xmath44 .",
    "thus , while reflecting the effect of oscillations , this ratio also minimises errors due to the uncertainties in the overall flux normalisation ( which can be as large as 30% ) . such a ratio , and its sensitivity to the parameters of neutrino oscillations , has been well - studied before ; in particular , detailed studies have been carried out by the monolith collaboration @xcite .",
    "we shall not repeat the results of such a study here ; however , we will use the information on the absolute value of @xmath4 that such a study will yield in order to analyse matter effects and its implication for the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "we now proceed with the numerical details .",
    "all calculations presented are done using the nuance neutrino generator . the atmospheric neutrino flux given by honda et al .",
    "@xcite is used .",
    "the code generates oscillation probabilities based on the three neutrino oscillation framework of barger et al .",
    "the earth matter effects are calculated using the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite for the variation in matter density .    apart from @xmath41 and @xmath40 , the probabilities depend on the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath4 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath1 ( the cp phase has been set to zero ) . since the focus of this paper is the issue of matter effects and mass hierarchy , we fix the other parameters at their best - fit values : @xmath138 and vary only the parameters of interest , viz . , @xmath4 ( both in magnitude and in sign ) and @xmath1 .",

    "it is obvious from figs .",
    "[ le5 ] and [ le11 ] that there is very little sensitivity to the sign of @xmath4 at small values of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , it is clear that atmospheric neutrino experiments can say very little about the hierarchy problem below @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "however , the sensitivity to the sign increases with the magnitude of @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that the position of the first minimum is _ independent _ of both @xmath1 and the sign of @xmath4 but depends only on the magnitude of the latter .",
    "hence it can be reliably used to determine the magnitude of @xmath4 as a precursor to determining its sign with the same experimental set - up .",
    "it is clear that the neutrino and anti - neutrino up / down event ratios are different from each other as well as different with direct and inverted mass hierarchies ( due to matter effects ) ; the distinction ( and hence measurement possibilities ) between the two hierarchies can be amplified by defining the asymmetry , @xmath153 the asymmetry , calculated numerically , and integrated over @xmath154 gev is plotted as a function of @xmath44 in fig .",

    "it is seen that the direct and inverted asymmetries are exactly out of phase .",
    "the maximum divergence between the direct and inverted hierarchies is smaller in the first envelope than in the second ; these correspond to the first dip and rise in the up / down events ratio ( equivalently , in @xmath54 ) .",
    "we will see in the next section that the statistically significant region with maximum number of events corresponds to these first few envelopes , i.e. , to the range @xmath160 for all the three values of the @xmath4 considered here .    for neutrinos of energy",
    "about 57 gev the interesting region thus corresponds to distances 400010000 km with an average around 7000 km @xcite which is really the magic baseline where matter effects are largest and the effect of the cp violating phase is negligible ( though we have set this phase to zero ) .    in order to understand why the direct and inverted asymmetries are out of phase ,",
    "it is convenient to appeal to the analytic expressions for the probabilities discussed in the previous section .",
    "since the events in a given @xmath44 bin are largely saturated by the smallest allowed energy in that bin ( the flux falls faster than @xmath161 ) , the effect of the cross - section factor is small and the up / down events ratio is well - approximated by the flux - averaged probability @xmath162 defined below : @xmath163 considering only the dominant contribution from @xmath54 to this expression , we see that @xmath164 corresponds to the approximate difference asymmetry , @xmath165 here @xmath166 denotes the survival probability for anti - neutrinos which is obtained from the corresponding neutrino survival probability @xmath167 by the replacement @xmath81 and the explicit dependences on the energy and path length @xmath40 and @xmath41 have been suppressed for clarity .    in the single mass - scale dominance approximation ( with @xmath168 ) , the survival probability for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos involves only the ratio @xmath87 . as a result we have , @xmath169 this is easy to see from the approximate expressions for the case of constant - density matter in eq .",

    "the @xmath175 difference asymmetry is almost exactly out of phase for direct and inverted hierarchies in @xmath44 bins whose widths can be optimally determined by a _ matter - independent _ condition involving @xmath176 and @xmath44 .",

    "we examine the event rates and asymmetries in a realistic magnetised iron calorimeter detector capable of charge identification such as in the monolith , minos and ical / ino proposals .",
    "so far we have discussed the theoretical up / down events ratios , a difference asymmetry and its matter sensitivity .",
    "we now need to address the question of statistics , i.e. , estimate the detector dimension and the time required for data accumulation .",
    "we generate events using the nuance neutrino generator @xcite with the ical / ino geometry which consists of 140 layers of 6 cm thick iron plates of transverse section 16 m @xmath26 32 m. the rpcs are sandwiched between the layers .",
    "the fiducial mass of the detector is a little under 30 ktons .",
    "results shown correspond to 480 kton - years data and indicate ( 1 ) the statistical significance of the events sample ( the error bars ) and ( 2 ) the impact of fluctuations ( deviation of the central values from the predictions of the previous section ) .",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 of those neutrinos that undergo charged current interaction in the detector to produce muons in the final state were directly used to generate the sums and asymmetries .",
    "the effect of finite @xmath44 resolution is discussed in the next section .",
    "a detailed study reconstructing the neutrino energy and direction from the final state muons and hadrons is in progress .",
    "as stated earlier , it was found that a cut of @xmath143 gev maximises the relative matter - dependent effect between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos . while such effects are washed out beyond @xmath177 gev , we integrated over all possible energies in a bin to improve statistics .",
    "data samples were generated for different values of @xmath1 and @xmath4 ( both signs ) , keeping the other parameters fixed to the values listed in the previous section .      to maximise the asymmetry , it is necessary to integrate the events in a bin size that includes one half - period of the oscillation , where the asymmetry is always positive or negative ( see fig .  [ ledif ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this is not easy since different path lengths correspond to different matter densities and the wavelength is density dependent .",
    "however , recall that the oscillation wave - length was roughly constant and matter - independent for ( anti-)neutrinos with ( direct ) inverted hierarchy .",
    "we therefore identify the bins spanning those @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath178 this has the advantage of being matter - independent .",
    "once @xmath179 is measured from the ( matter / hierarchy - independent ) first minimum in the plot of the @xmath180 ratio as a function of @xmath44 , this can be used to generate the bin sizes for studying the matter - dependent asymmetry .",
    "we exhibit the results for @xmath181 ev@xmath140 in figs .",
    "[ le1 ] , [ le2 ] and [ le3 ] respectively . in each figure",
    "the events asymmetry @xmath164 is plotted as a function of @xmath44 . in all cases , a zenith angle cut of @xmath182",
    "was used to remove `` horizontal '' events , as discussed earlier .",
    "the first data point corresponds to a region where no matter effect is expected , that is , up to an @xmath44 smaller than the @xmath183 value in eq .",
    "[ bins ] above .",
    "the `` data '' points shown correspond to binning the actual events generated using the nuance monte carlo event generator in bins whose widths follow the expression eq .  [ bins ] .",
    "the `` dots '' and the `` crosses '' correspond to the direct and inverted hierarchy .",
    "the theoretical asymmetry generated by integrating the differential event rate over the bin width is plotted for comparison as a histogram .",
    "the darker lines correspond to the direct hierarchy and lighter ones to the inverted hierarchy .",
    "the deviation of the points from the value indicated by the corresponding histogram is an indicator of fluctuations .",
    "the size of the error - bar on the data reflects only the statistical error due to the data size in that bin .",
    "the error bars are larger for the inverted than for the direct hierarchy in a given bin .",
    "this is because it is the anti - neutrino event rate that is sensitive to matter effects in the case of inverted hierarchy , as described in section 2",
    ". since the anti - neutrino cross - sections are about a factor of two smaller than the neutrino cross - section , the event rates are smaller and the error bars correspondingly larger . statistically speaking , therefore ,",
    "it is easier to detect direct than inverted hierarchy .",
    "results are separately shown for @xmath184 degrees .",
    "it is easily seen that the greatest sensitivity to matter effects occurs for a value of @xmath185 ev@xmath140 . for a smaller @xmath186 , the matter effect",
    "does not develop significantly until a fairly large @xmath44 , where the event rates begin to drop ; for larger @xmath187 , the larger number of bins where the asymmetry changes sign leads to smaller statistics per bin .",
    "note that the first oscillation period ( second data point ) corresponds to a minimum in the up - coming events rate . in all cases ,",
    "the largest sensitivity to the hierarchy is therefore in the region around the first maximum in the up / down ratio , or the third bin .",
    "in fact , the survival probability is sensitive to matter effects for energies roughly in the range @xmath188 gev .",
    "the cut of 4 gev on the neutrino energy is used to accentuate the asymmetry in the third bin .",
    "a negative ( positive ) value of asymmetry in this bin clearly indicates direct ( inverted ) mass hierarchy",
    ". it may be possible to improve this result by binning over regions of @xmath44 taking into account modifications due to matter of eq .",
    "[ bins ] ; in fact , with real data , it may be also be possible to have variable bin sizes , determined by maximising the magnitude of the asymmetry in each bin .",
    "we shall not attempt this here .",
    "we only wish to note that the third bin is automatically identified once the magnitude of @xmath4 is determined",
    ". it may also be possible to combine the results of several bins ( with appropriate sign ) to improve the statistics .",
    "note that with an energy cut @xmath189 gev , the events are roughly distributed in the proportion @xmath190 from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , resonance ( dominated by 1-pion processes ) ( rs ) , and quasi - elastic ( qe ) charged current processes respectively .",
    "there are roughly 3000 events in 480 kton - years , of which about 35% are up - going ones .",
    "finally , if a non - zero asymmetry is measured , this will yield both the mass hierarchy as well as a lower bound on @xmath1 of at least @xmath191 ( @xmath192 ) . while the amplitude of the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath193",
    ", limitations due to statistics make it unlikely that the value of @xmath1 itself will be determined with any reasonable accuracy .",
    "one needs to address this issue elsewhere .",
    "inclusion of finite detector resolution reduces the sensitivity , especially beyond the first oscillation minimum and maximum .",
    "a straightforward way to include such effects is to smear the observed @xmath41 and @xmath40 and observe the impact of this . to this end , we define gaussian resolution functions for both @xmath41 and @xmath40 : @xmath194~ ; \\\\ \\nonumber r_2(l ' , l ) & \\equiv & \\by{1}{\\sqrt{{2}{\\pi}}\\sigma_2 } \\exp \\left [ \\by{-(l - l')^2}{2 \\sigma_2 ^ 2 } \\right]~. \\label{resfns}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , the event rate now includes the probability that a neutrino of any possible @xmath195 and @xmath196 is detected in the detector with path - length @xmath41 and energy @xmath40 .",
    "we have @xmath197 where and @xmath40 integrates to a lorentzian in their ratio provided the integration over _ all _ variables is unrestricted .",
    "we need to specify individual resolution functions here because of the cut on @xmath40 . ]",
    "@xmath198 .",
    "we re - evaluate the event rates and the up / down asymmetries using this equation , with @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "these are realistic widths obtained by a geant analysis of atmospheric neutrino events by both the monolith and the ical / ino collaborations ; this gives a typical fwhm for their ratio @xmath201 to be about @xmath202 .",
    "the up / down events ratio ( for the case of the direct hierarchy ) is shown on the right side of fig .",
    "[ le511r ] as a function of @xmath44 for @xmath45 ev@xmath46 .",
    "the results without including resolution functions is shown in the left - hand panel , for comparison .",
    "as before , a cut on the neutrino energy of @xmath189 gev is applied . with the inclusion of the resolution functions , it is seen that the _ amplitude _ of the oscillation is greatly damped .",
    "furthermore , the neutrino rates ratio ( shown as thick blue lines ) is damped much more than that for the anti - neutrinos ( the converse will be true for the inverted hierarchy ) .",
    "curves correspond to @xmath203 .",
    "clear oscillations are visible only around the first minimum and maximum .    the resulting asymmetry , that is , the difference of the neutrino and anti - neutrino events ratios , @xmath164 , is plotted in fig .",
    "[ ledifr ] .",
    "again , the panels on the right correspond to the rates calculation including resolution , while those on the left correspond to rates without including resolution effects .",
    "there is virtually no difference for small @xmath44 . in general",
    ", however , the amplitude of the asymmetry decreases although it is still largest in the second envelope ( corresponding to the third bin in the earlier discussions ) .",
    "it is seen that the asymmetry is larger with a cut of @xmath143 gev than with a cut of @xmath204 gev while the _ number of events _ is smaller by roughly half in the case of the larger energy cut . in particular , by lowering the cut to @xmath204 gev , not only does the sample size effectively double , the contribution from various processes changes to the proportion @xmath205 from @xmath206 for dis , rs and qe processes .",
    "thus there are two conflicting requirements : to enhance the size of the asymmetry , we need a larger value of @xmath207 , but to improve statistics , we need a larger sample size .",
    "the final choice of @xmath208 should optimise these two requirements .",
    "we note in passing that , for @xmath143 gev , there is a fairly large asymmetry for large @xmath44 as well ; the statistical significance in this bin is however small . in both cases ,",
    "the asymmetry in the penultimate envelope is almost vanishingly small ; the oscillation length in this case is also very small .    in short",
    ", it appears that a finite resolution function causes smearing of the data across bins in such a way that the magnitude of the asymmetry becomes significantly smaller , and even vanishes beyond the third envelope / bin .",
    "we can improve the result by summing the asymmetries over several envelopes .",
    "we define @xmath209 where @xmath210 corresponds to a given hierarchy , direct , or inverted , @xmath211 .",
    "typically , @xmath212 in a bin , and therefore the sum in eq .",
    "[ anh ] is roughly equal and opposite for the two hierarchies .",
    "furthermore , the statistics are not very different with either hierarchy .",
    "the significance of the result is thus estimated by comparing the difference @xmath213 with the error @xmath214 corresponding to a given exposure .",
    "in fact , the ratio @xmath215 indicates the probability of the observed asymmetry being assigned to the correct hierarchy .",
    "the error @xmath214 arises primarily from statistics .",
    "this is because the asymmetry is defined as a difference of two ratios .",
    "systematic errors ( due to uncertainties both in fluxes and cross - sections ) in the ratio are therefore very small and can be ignored ; this was pointed out very early on by the monolith collaboration @xcite .",
    "we list the values of @xmath216 and the corresponding statistical error @xmath217 ( we have chosen the larger of the errors for the direct and inverted hierarchy ) in tables [ table15el ] , [ table10el ] , [ table05el ] for different resolutions in @xmath40 and @xmath41 of 15% , 10% , and 5% respectively . in each table , results for both @xmath218 and @xmath219 ( that is , a sum over two or three envelopes ) , corresponding to @xmath220 ev@xmath46 and @xmath221 are shown for different exposures of 480 , 800 and 1120 kton - years respectively .",
    "the resulting confidence level of the measurement is also indicated in the tables .",
    "it is clear that the asymmetry and hence @xmath222 increases with @xmath1 , _ independent _ of exposure .",
    "the effect of increasing the exposure is to improve the errors , without changing the central values of the asymmetry .",
    "this can be seen by comparing results for the same @xmath1 in each table .",
    "since the minimum exposure of 480 kton - years is already large , and statistical errors improve only as @xmath223 , it will be difficult to greatly enhance the significance of the result by going to larger and larger exposures .",
    "the effect of improving the resolution function ( obtained by comparing the same row in the tables [ table15el ] , [ table10el ] and [ table05el ] is two - fold . for a given exposure , improving the resolution function ( by which we mean the improving the gaussian widths of the resolutions in @xmath40 and @xmath41 as defined in eq .",
    "[ resfns ] above ) _ increases the central value of the asymmetry _ in each case .",
    "it also results in marginally improved errors for @xmath224 , that is , when summing over all the three significant bins in the @xmath44 distribution , which further enhances the significance of the result .",
    "for example , the improvement upon increasing the exposure from 480 to 1120 kton - years at 15% resolution is similar to that obtained by improving the resolution , _ at 480 kton - years _ , from 15% to 10% .",
    "note also that the significance of the results for @xmath225 is higher than for @xmath226 for larger resolutions of 15% ; this may imply that best results are obtained from single - bin information when the resolutions are poorer . also , it turns out that the results are systematically better for a cut of @xmath227 gev rather than for a cut of 2 gev .    while resolutions with widths of 10% may not be hard to achieve ,",
    "it is not clear whether it is possible to reach 5% .",
    "one way is to exclude the dis events ( perhaps by cutting out events with large hadronic activity ) . the resulting data set is smaller by about 45% ; however , it may be possible to resolve the energy and direction of the neutrino much better since there are only quasi - elastic and resonance events left in the sample .",
    "this needs to be studied in more detail .    in summary",
    ", it appears that , even for moderate to large exposures , it may be difficult to achieve effects larger than @xmath228 or so , unless of course nature is kind and prefers large @xmath1 . for @xmath229 , a significance of 99.3% ( nearly @xmath230 ) or more",
    "is obtained with an exposure of 800 ( 1120 ) kton - years and resolutions in both energy and angle of 5% ( 10% ) .",
    "it is clear that a prior knowledge of @xmath1 from some other experiment would greatly facilitate the extraction of the mass hierarchy since the magnitude of the expected asymmetry would then be known .    in short ,",
    "the major features of the analysis without including finite detector resolutions appear to hold , although with much reduced significance .",
    "a prima facie case has been made for determining mass hierarchy through observation of atmospheric neutrinos with ical detectors ; however , the effect is small and is difficult to measure .",
    "indeed , it is clear that the asymmetry is very sensitive to smearing in both @xmath41 and @xmath40 .",
    "our study indicates that an _ improvement in the detector resolution _ has a stronger impact on the results than a mere enhancement in size or the number of years of data - accumulation . a detailed study involving actual reconstruction of muon and hadron energies and muon direction",
    "is needed to determine the ultimate sensitivity of such a detector to the issue of hierarchy .      the results from the sum of neutrino and anti - neutrino events @xmath231 are much less sensitive to matter effects , as expected .",
    "results ( with same cuts as above ) are shown in figs .",
    "[ lep1 ] , [ lep2 ] and [ lep3 ] for @xmath232 ev@xmath140 respectively . for large values of @xmath233 , the amplitude of the sum averages to 1/2",
    "much faster for the direct hierarchy .",
    "the numerical study will need to be carefully done to establish the significance of this result .",
    "we have discussed the possibility of obtaining information on the mixing angle @xmath1 and the sign of @xmath4 using a magnetised iron calorimeter collecting data on atmospheric muon neutrinos , capable of charge identification .",
    "it appears that such a detector will be sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy only if @xmath191 ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "we have defined a difference asymmetry in eq .",
    "[ rateasym ] as the difference between the up / down rates of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos . by taking the up / down ratio ,",
    "the systematic errors are greatly reduced . in particular , the uncertainty in the overall flux normalisation is removed .",
    "such a ratio also minimises the dependence on the cross - section , which is substantially different for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the gev energy range of interest . as a consequence",
    ", the measurable rate asymmetry is related to a theoretical flux - weighted probability ( difference ) asymmetry given in eq .",
    "examination of the theoretical asymmetry immediately suggests ways of binning the data in order to maximise the asymmetry in each bin ( in @xmath44 ) .",
    "it turns out that the _ sign of the asymmetry _ is sensitive to the neutrino mass hierarchy ( that is , the sign of @xmath0 ) while its magnitude is sensitive to the ( 13 ) mixing angle @xmath1 .      * the limits on @xmath49 and @xmath105",
    "may be reliably obtained using the location of the first minimum and the amplitude of first oscillation of a plot of the ratio of up / down events as a function of @xmath44 . while no detailed discussion on this issue has been presented here , it has been well - established elsewhere @xcite .",
    "+ the detector mass - exposure required for this purpose is about 150 kton - years .",
    "while charge identification is not crucial for this step , presence of a magnetic field helps in obtaining better energy resolution .",
    "this step however is _ not dependent _ on the value of @xmath1 or the sign of @xmath4 .",
    "* if @xmath1 is larger than @xmath2 , then the pattern of subsequent oscillations after the first dip can give definite indication about the hierarchy through the difference asymmetry as discussed above .",
    "it is possible to maximise the sensitivity to this asymmetry in fixed @xmath44 bins ( improve statistical significance ) by applying an energy cut , @xmath235 gev .",
    "an optimum @xmath236 dependent bin - width can be determined that is _",
    "matter independent_. this is easily accomplished as @xmath187 can be well determined independently as discussed above . + for direct hierarchy the matter effects dominate through the neutrinos which have a higher cross section and hence give more pronounced matter effects . if the matter effects are small even when @xmath1 is large , then it is a clear indication of inverted hierarchy since the dominant neutrino events will have less impact due to matter .",
    "* inclusion of finite detector resolution reduces the sensitivity , especially beyond the first oscillation minimum and maximum in @xmath44 .",
    "a combination of enhanced exposure and improved resolution will still enable a measurement of the mass hierarchy , provided @xmath1 is not too small , @xmath191 .",
    "the best scenario is when @xmath1 is already established from other experiments to be in the favourable range .",
    "of course , in the absence of such a measurement , non - observation of the asymmetry can put a lower bound on @xmath1 while leaving open the issue of the hierarchy . *",
    "it is therefore important to maximise the sensitivity of the detector to the range of @xmath44 where the matter effects are significant",
    ". it may be interesting to consider a non - horizontal detector geometry in order to maximise the sensitivity to the relevant @xmath44 bins ; typically , these correspond to an average path - length @xmath41 around 7000 km . if neutrinos with such path - lengths are to be transverse to the iron plates , a geometry with plates tilted at about @xmath237 to the horizontal may be preferred .",
    "this needs more careful study .",
    "while many experiments ( present and proposed ) will be sensitive to the ( 13 ) mixing angle @xmath1 , it appears that charge identification may be essential for settling the issue of the mass hierarchy . in this context",
    "we note that reactor neutrino experiments are not sensitive to matter effects and will be complementary to an ical detector .",
    "short - baseline accelerator experiments may also not be as sensitive to matter effects .",
    "long - baseline experiments with neutrino factory beams can surely settle this issue , and are sensitive to much smaller values of @xmath1 , but are expected to come on - line at much later times .",
    "thus a study of atmospheric neutrinos with a magnetised iron calorimeter detector can , in principle , provide fundamental information on the parameters of the neutrino mixing matrix and the neutrino mass - squared differences ; in particular , it may resolve the question of hierarchy in the neutrino masses .",
    "it is certain that large exposures ( more than 500 kton - years ) will be required to obtain a result with a significance of at least 90% cl .",
    "in addition , good resolution in both energy and angle discrimination is required . for larger @xmath238",
    ", a significance of 99.3% ( nearly @xmath230 ) or more is obtained with an exposure of 800 ( 1120 ) kton - years and resolutions in both energy and angle of 5% ( 10% ) .",
    "results for smaller @xmath1 remain at the ( @xmath228 ) 95% cl even in the best - case scenario .",
    "hence the practical issue of experimental feasibility seems much harder to resolve .",
