    "by definition , a recurrent nova ( rn ) has been seen to undergo multiple episodes of thermonuclear runaway within the last century or so . for the hydrogen - rich envelope to reach the high temperature and density required for a runaway in such a short period , the white dwarf must be massive and its accretion rate must be high .",
    "although only ten galactic rne are currently known , the true number of rne is likely to be much larger , considering the low discovery probability of nova outbursts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( schaefer 2009 ) ) .",
    "two important goals for rn observers in the context of type ia progenitors therefore are ( i ) observational determination of white dwarf mass and accretion rate ; and ( ii ) search for hitherto undiscovered or unrecognized rne .    in non magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and symbiotic stars ,",
    "x - rays are emitted in the boundary layer between the disk and the white dwarf .",
    "optically thin boundary layers predominantly emit hard x - rays ; even optically thick boundary layers are seen to retain some hard x - ray flux , presumably because the surface layer remains optically thin ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( patterson & raymond 1985 ) ) .",
    "these hard x - rays are multi - temperature plasma emission whose maximum temperature is strongly constrained by the depth of the gravitational potential , i.e. , the white dwarf mass .",
    "thus , hard x - ray observations may be a viable alternative method to optical and uv spectroscopy in our study of white dwarf masses , particularly in cases of high interstellar extinction .    if the keplerian flow just above the white dwarf surface is strongly shocked , then the shock temperature is half of the free - fall case , well known in the studies of magnetic cvs .",
    "multiple groups have used x - ray spectroscopy to infer the white dwarf mass in magnetic cvs ; the study of quiescent x - rays from dwarf novae ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( byckling  2010 ) ) suggests that this is also possible for non - magnetic cvs .",
    "one complication is that the hard x - ray emission of a dwarf nova usually becomes fainter and softer during outburst when a part of the boundary layer becomes optically thick ( see below for a possible reason ) .",
    "even so , the maximum temperature derived for the hard component sets a firm lower limit for the white dwarf mass .",

    "the best - fit temperature of 70 kev corresponds to 1.01 m@xmath0 and 1.33 m@xmath0 , respectively.,width=10 ]    in recent years , four symbiotic stars have been detected as luminous hard x - ray sources in the _ swift _ bat and _ integral _ surveys ( * ? ? ? * kennea  ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "one of the four is t  crb , with a 15150 kev luminosity of 7@xmath1 ^ 2 $ ] ergs@xmath2 .",
    "the current generation of hard x - ray all - sky surveys have a detection limit of order @xmath3 ergs@xmath4s@xmath2 , or @xmath5 ergs@xmath2 at 1 kpc , below which many more hard x - ray bright symbiotics are likely to exist .",
    "in fact , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* luna  ( 2010 ) ) have significantly increased the number of known hard x - ray sources among symbiotic stars through pointed observations with _ swift _ xrt .",
    "* kennea  ( 2009 ) ) made the case that t  crb contains a near chandrasekhar mass , non - magnetic white dwarf using a bremsstrahlung fit to the bat spectrum available at the time .",
    "we have updated their argument as follows .",
    "we fit the bat spectrum below 100 kev from the _ swift _ bat 58-month survey with a cooling flow model , and obtain the maximum temperature of kt@xmath66 kev .",
    "if the emission is from an optically thin boundary layer , it implies a white dwarf mass of m@xmath7=1.2 m@xmath0 .",
    "more likely , a significant portion of the boundary layer in t  crb is optically thick , given that the high uv luminosity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( selvelli  1992 ) ) .",
    "if this has resulted in the reduction of kt@xmath8 by a factor of 1.7 , as it does in ss  cyg in outburst , then m@xmath7=1.35 m@xmath0 in t  crb .",
    "v2487 oph is the first nova for with a pre - outburst x - ray detection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( hernanz & sala 2002 ) ) .",
    "it is also a hard x - ray source detected in the _ integral _ and _ swift _ bat surveys .",
    "although this is a cv and not a symbiotic system ( the mass donor in v2487  oph is not a red giant ) , its x - ray spectrum can be compared to that of t  crb . using the bat 58-month survey data and a cooling flow model , the best fit",
    "kt@xmath8 is 70 kev ; the 90% lower limit is 34 kev , while the upper limit can not be constrained due primarily to the limited grid of plasma models available within the cooling flow model . for a distance of 12 kpc (",
    "* ( schaefer 2010 ) ) , its 210 kev luminosity is close to 10@xmath9 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , intermediate polars ( ips ) , the most hard x - ray luminous subclass of magnetic cvs , usually do not exceed 10@xmath10 ergss@xmath2 .",
    "v2487  oph was established as an rn by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pagnotta  ( 2009 ) ) , who discovered its 1900 outburst in photographic plates .",
    "v2487 oph is often considered a candidate ip , based on its x - ray appearances .",
    "however , the signature of a spin period , a key defining characteristic of ips , has never been seen in this object .",
    "moreover , the hardness of its x - ray spectrum can be explained by two scenarios : it may be a magnetic cv with a moderately massive white dwarf , or it may be a non - magnetic cv with a near chandrasekhar mass white dwarf ( figure1 ) .",
    "also considering the fact that v2487  oph is a rn , the latter interpretation is very attractive .",
    "v2491  cyg has several similarity with v2487  oph , including a pre - nova x - ray detection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( ibarra  2009 ) ) and the strong post - nova x - ray emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( takei  2011 ) ) .",
    "these x - ray characteristics alone make it a candidate rn , which seems to be corroborated by several rn - like characteristics in the optical .",
    "we also find several other cvs that are not known to be a nova , let alone rne , and have not been firmly established to be magnetic , in the bat 58-month survey catalog : ah  men , v426  oph , tw  pic , and v1082  sgr ( two dwarf novae , ss  cyg and ru  peg , are also detected by bat but their accretion rates are presumably too low to be of interest in this context ) .",
    "these 4 systems may deserve further attention .",
    "however , it is now clear that not all rne are x - ray bright .",
    "rs  oph is significantly fainter in x - rays ( 2@xmath11 ergss@xmath2 , 0.310 kev on day 538 ) and significantly softer ( kt@xmath12 kev in a cooling flow fit ) than t  crb ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( nelson  2011 ) ) .",
    "t  pyx in quiescence is also a faint ( and not supersoft ) x - ray source .",
    "the central binary has a luminosity of @xmath13 ergss@xmath2 for a distance of d=3.5 kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "balman 2010 ) ) .",
    "we have observed 3 additional galactic rne , v394  cra , ci  aql , and and i m  nor with _ xmm - newton_. for i m  nor , there is a source at ra=15:39:27.6 , dec=@xmath1452:18:55.1 , roughly 30@xmath15 from the cataloged position of this rn , at about 4.2@xmath16 cs@xmath2 with a poorly constrained spectrum .",
    "if this x - ray source is the rn , its luminosity is roughly 5 @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] ergss@xmath2 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "v394  cra and ci  aql are undetected with 210 kev upper limits of 5 @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] ergss@xmath2 and 5 @xmath17 ^ 2 $ ] ergss@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "we note that i m  nor and ci  aql are known to be eclipsing .",
    "if the inclination angles are high enough , or the disks thick enough , it is possible that the white dwarf is always hidden from our view , in which case the observations do not necessarily reflect the true x - ray luminosity of these systems .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that not all rne are luminous hard x - ray sources like t  crb and v2487  oph .",
    "these x - ray faint rne may nevertheless harbor massive white dwarfs accreting at high rates .",
    "the x - ray luminosity can be reduced if the boundary layer is completely optically thick , if the white dwarf is rotating at near break - up spin , or if the optically thin part of the boundary layer is compton - cooled .",
    "when bremsstrahlung is the primary cooling mechanism of the post - shock plasma , the cooling time is inversely proportional to the square of the density ; the plasma cools and becomes denser , which increases the cooling efficiency , and the cycle repeats .",
    "however , if there is a strong external field of soft photons , compton cooling may be more efficient than bremsstrahlung in parts of the boundary layer .",
    "* nelson  ( 2011 ) ) explored the possibility of compton cooling for rs  oph , and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fertig  ( 2011 ) ) applied the same idea to dwarf novae in outburst .",
    "compton cooling dominates over bremsstrahlung only in the less dense , which is also the hotter , regions of the boundary layer .",
    "therefore , compton cooling lowers both the temperature and the luminosity of the observed hard x - ray emission .",
    "this is indeed seen in dwarf novae in outburst , in which the seed photons are supplied by the optically thick part of the boundary layer .",
    "if , in rs  oph , the entire white dwarf is still hot and luminous ( @xmath19 ergss@xmath2 ) , this can provide a copious amount of seed photons .",
    "therefore , the potential difference in the white dwarf temperature can explain the different x - ray properties of rs  oph and t  crb in principle .",
    "the luminosity of the white dwarf in rne is likely to depend on the time since last outburst , somewhat longer - term history of recent outbursts , and other factors .",
    "if our compton cooling model is correct , then rne with luminous white dwarf are x - ray faint .",
    "while this interpretation is not firmly established , it offers a plausible explanation for the diverse x - ray characteristics of quiescent rne without invoking a low mass white dwarf or a low accretion rate .",
    "we have learned that some quiescent rne are luminous , hard x - ray sources .",
    "although the fraction of such systems among rne is unknown , this offers a new method for discovering rne candidates . a sensitive hard x - ray all - sky survey , such as expected using the _ e - rosita _ mission , will be very useful in this regard .",
    "the x - ray spectra of t  crb and v2487  oph are consistent with what one would expect for an optically thin , or partially optically thick , boundary layer around a massive non - magnetic white dwarf . with the current level of knowledge",
    ", we can not measure the white dwarf mass accurately , although high temperature x - ray emission requires high m@xmath7 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is a direct measure of the accretion rate onto the white dwarf if and only if the boundary layer is completely optically thin ; in the partially optically thick case , we can only provide a lower limit for the accretion rate .",
    "the existence of x - ray faint rne requires an explanation .",
    "we offer compton cooling as a possibility .",
    "in addition to more quantitative exploration of this process , we must understand the evolution of the white dwarf luminosity appropriate in the rn regime ."
