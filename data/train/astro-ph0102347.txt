    "nova aquilae no.4 was discovered by max wolf on photographic plates of the heidelberg observatory taken in 1919 , and was announced in a short note in the _ astronomische nachrichten _ of 1920 may 28 ( wolf 1920 ) .",
    "subsequently , the star was analyzed on harvard plates , and another short note was published by ida woods ( 1921 ) . at that time , the object was thought to be a very slow nova .",
    "its peculiarity was only noted when lundmark ( 1921 ) took spectra in september 1921 , and classified it as a carbon star .",
    "this classification caused little interest at the time of publication , and lead to no closer studies .",
    "visual observations , carried out at later stages , showed pronounced fadings as well as recoveries , and the star was thought to be a long period variable .",
    "the observational record can be classified as follows .",
    "photographic observations in heidelberg ( magnitudes and comparison stars ) , part of the photographic observations in harvard , and all photographic observations at lick were published .",
    "all estimates and comparison stars at harvard could be recovered in miss woods notebooks .",
    "they contain , in addition to the published record , many negative observations ( i.e. times when the object was not visible above a certain magnitude limit ) , and estimates made after the 1921 paper .    all photographic observations were transformed to the modern magnitude scale , using data from the tycho-2 catalogue .",
    "the lick observations were newly estimated , using the harvard scale ( they agree very well with lundmark s old estimates ) , and transformed into tycho-2 magnitudes .",
    "the differences between the original ( pg ) and the modern ( @xmath0 ) values were @xmath1 and @xmath2 , for heidelberg and harvard , respectively .",
    "the visual magnitudes are less known and more difficult to use .",
    "the two observers , michael esch sj ( sternwarte valkenburg ) and kasimir graff ( hamburger sternwarte ) , published only short accounts in the beobachtungs - zirkular of the astronomische nachrichten , without giving information on standard stars ( esch 1923a , b ; graff 1923a , b ) .",
    "both authors had planned more detailed publications . during the years 1920  1932 , esch collected 49 observations ( esch 1935 ) , but it is possible that the major part of them were negative ones . in the 1930s , esch began to publish his extensive observations of variable stars in the verffentlichungen der sternwarte des ignatiuskollegs valkenburg ( the netherlands ) ; this series was interrupted by his death ( 1938 ) . in 1942 , actions against the jesuits took place .",
    "the kolleg was devastated and dissolved by german secret police .",
    "fortunately , after esch s death , his notebooks were taken to the vatican observatory for evaluation .",
    "a first ( and only ) publication by albert zirwes , appeared in 1943 in the publications of the vatican observatory .",
    "aql was , however , not among the published stars , and a recent search for esch s observing book(s ) in the archives of the vatican observatory has been unsuccessful so far .",
    "graff also planned to publish visual magnitude scales of variables and associated observations that he had carried out in hamburg ( graff 1928 ) .",
    "then , he accepted a call as director of the vienna observatory , and his project was shelved .",
    "he had to resign at the time of the nazis , but was re - instated after the end of ww ii . by this time , graff was a sick man and died soon after .",
    "his written estate appears to be lost .",
    "the fragmentary light curve of v605 aql ( fig .",
    "1 ) is tantalizing .",
    "the photometric calibration can not be regarded as final , it supersedes , however , the published light curve of harrison ( 1996 ) .",
    "the rise to photographic maximum and the early decline of v605 aql are fairly well documented . in view of the many negative photographic observations at late phases",
    "( also indicated by an upper limit in early 1923 ) , the positive visual observations indicate that the object was very red at this time .",
    "no ` quasi - simultaneous ' photographic and visual observations exist .",
    "since rapid , large light fluctuations are documented , no colour index can be derived with certainty .",
    "the photographic data show that v605 aql rose to maximum with a rate of about @xmath3 mag / day , and afterwards declined with @xmath4 mag / day .",
    "these values are uncertain , but are similar to those observed in v4334 sgr ( @xmath5 mag / day and @xmath4 mag / day ) .",
    "after 1923 , v605 aql disappeared from view : no positive observations down to @xmath6 mag exist for the years 1928  1979 ( fuhrmann 1981 ) .",
    "a comparison of the ` period of visibility ' of both objects indicates that v4334 sgr vanished more quickly from view .",
    "unfortunately , the total time of visibility of v605 aql can not be stated with certainty , unless esch s notebook is recovered in the vatican archives . in any case , if the analogy between v605 aql and v4334 sgr holds , sakurai s object will remain very faint for some decades .",
    "v4334 sgr and v605 aql appear to have very similar light curve characteristics , and v605 aql might serve as a ` pathfinder ' for the events that will happen to v4334 sgr in the future , e.g. the gradual re - appearance of the hot central star within the dust cocoon .",
