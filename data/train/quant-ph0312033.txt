    "classical bi - hamiltonian systems have played a relevant role in the past decades for the study of completely integrable systems , both for finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom ( see ref . 1 and ref . 2 for quantum systems ) .",
    "quantum systems admitting alternative commutation relations have been considered many times since the pioneering paper of e.p .",
    "wigner@xcite , see also ref . 4 , 5 , 6 .",
    "quantum systems described by non hermitian operators and possessing a real spectrum have been analyzed by several authors ( e.g. ref .",
    "7 , 8) .    in a recent paper@xcite",
    "we have shown that these situations may be better tackled within the framework of the  inverse problem for quantum systems  . from a mathematical point of view",
    "a similar problem was first discussed by nagy@xcite long ago .    to clearly formulate this problem",
    "let us briefly recall first the symplectic inverse problem for classical linear systems .",
    "starting with a vector field @xmath0 one searches far all possible hamiltonian descriptions in terms of symplectic structures @xmath1 by solving for the equation @xmath2 .",
    "every symplectic structure admits an  inverse  , it is a bivector field , usually called a poisson tensor , defined by @xmath3 thus , the inverse problem amounts to search for all decompositions of @xmath4 as the product @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a skewsymmetric real , point dependent , matrix .",
    "if we deal with linear vector fields and quadratic hamiltonians , say @xmath7 the inverse problem becomes a problem of linear algebra , i.e. searching for all decompositions of the dynamical matrix @xmath8 into the product of a non degenerate skew - symmetric matrix @xmath9 and a symmetric matrix @xmath10 , in compact form @xmath11  when @xmath9 is not required to be non - degenerate , we are dealing with the  inverse problem for poisson dynamic.@xcite we should remark  that this problem is more interesting when we are considering non - linear situations and non constant rank of @xmath9 , otherwise , by quotienting with respect to the kernel of @xmath12 we may go back to the symplectic situation .",
    "thus all possible decompositions of @xmath8 , in the stated form , provide us with alternative hamiltonian descriptions .",
    "in many physical situations , when dealing with completely integrable systems , we are interested in the existence of alternative decompositions once one has been already given , i.e. we search for alternative hamiltonian descriptions for a given hamiltonian system @xmath13 .",
    "the alternative descriptions would characterize @xmath13 as a multi - hamiltonian vector field .",
    "it is almost obvious that many alternative hamiltonian descriptions will be generated by symmetries for @xmath13 which are not canonical transformations for @xmath14 .",
    "however this way of generating new hamiltonian descriptions will not exhaust the class of alternative ones .",
    "for instance@xcite the two dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator has different decompositions with either @xmath10 definite positive or with signature ( + , + , -,- ) , which arise from the following hamiltonian descriptions : @xmath15 and @xmath16 these factorizations can not be related by any similarity transformation . in this setting , it has been shown@xcite that when the critical point of the linear vector field @xmath13 is stable in the liapunov sense , among the alternative hamiltonian descriptions there is one which is positive definite .",
    "the formulation of the inverse problem for quantum systems is now quite natural : given a vector field @xmath13 on some vector space @xmath17 , we search for all hermitian structures @xmath18 which are solution of the equation @xmath19 @xmath20 .    in our previous papers ref .",
    "7 , 17 , to avoid technicalities , we have carried on our study of the inverse problem within the framework of finite dimensional hilbert spaces ; in this paper we would like to consider the problem in the more relevant case of infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sections 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 the problem is specified , mathematical results are reviewed , some applications are given and the dependence of results on the fiducial metric @xmath21  is studied . in section 6",
    "we give some results on the existence of alternative invariant hermitian scalar products ; in section 7 a way for finding invariant scalar products for abelian groups is considered ; in section 8 we deal with the more general situation of related operators instead of similar ones ; in section 9 we apply our considerations to the heisenberg group .",
    "finally in section 10 we describe quantum systems as hamiltonian systems and discuss the consequences of the existence of alternative invariant scalar products , in section 11 we draw some conclusions .",
    "results which are available in the literature are referred here as theorems , while our considerations are recast in propositions and corollaries .",
    "we consider a linear dynamical system @xmath13 on a complex vector space of states @xmath22 carrying a hilbert space structure @xmath23  ( we define all scalar products to be linear in their second factor ) .",
    "then @xmath13@xmath24 determines the differential equation @xmath25 where @xmath10 is a linear operator on @xmath22 ,  but we do not require any hermiticity properties with respect to @xmath23 .",
    "hereafter we put @xmath26    the inverse problem consists of finding which conditions have to be satisfied by @xmath13 for the existence of hermitian scalar products invariant under the time evolution associated with @xmath13 .    in finite dimensions , i.e. for a complex linear vector field on @xmath27 , we have@xcite the following proposition :    a complex linear vector field @xmath28 generates a flow @xmath29 @xmath30 preserving some hermitian scalar product @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath31 , iff any one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied :    \\1 ) @xmath32 where the adjoint is taken with respect to the scalar product defined by @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath33 ;    \\2 ) @xmath10 is diagonalizable and has a real spectrum ;    \\3 ) all the orbits @xmath34 are bounded sets , for any initial condition @xmath35 .",
    "* sometimes , properties stated in 2 ) are derived by requiring that the hamiltonian is @xmath36symmetric ( see for instance ref .",
    "12 , 13 ) .",
    "the proof of this proposition relies on the existence of a decomposition of @xmath10 into a nilpotent part and a semisimple part , commuting among themselves .",
    "once we exponentiate this decomposition , the boundedness condition rules out the nilpotent part and requires that the semisimple part of @xmath37 has only imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "when going to infinite dimensions one may try to use a similar procedure , however the corresponding separation of @xmath37 holds true only for a special class of operators.@xcite therefore we have to use a different approach .",
    "when dealing with infinite dimensions , it is clear that , according to weyl,@xcite condition 3 ) will play a more convenient role because it is stated in terms of ( what is going to become ) the bounded operators @xmath38 instead of the infinitesimal generator @xmath37 which , in the most physical situations , turns out to be unbounded and therefore would raise domain problems which make statements more cumbersome .",
    "therefore , within weyl s ideology , it is better to deal with finite transformations ( i.e. automorphisms of the state space ) rather than infinitesimal transformations ( i.e. endomorphisms , which , in general , create domain problems ) .",
    "this step , when starting with eq .",
    "( [ scroe ] ) , may be achieved by using the cayley map , i.e. by replacing @xmath10 with @xmath39 for a recent , authoritative analysis of this map see kostant - michor.@xcite in this way we search for scalar products turning @xmath40 into a unitary operator and accordingly @xmath10 into a self - adjoint operator with a unitary flow @xmath38 .",
    "of course we could also decide to formulate the inverse problem in quantum mechanics directly in terms of one - parameter groups of automorphisms for the state space and to seek for all hermitian products which turn the one - parameter group of transformations into a unitary one - parameter group .",
    "we shall therefore start with automorphisms of the state space instead of endomorphisms . to set the stage , we consider the vector space of states to be a hilbert space , i.e. topology , completeness and bases",
    "are defined with respect to a chosen fiducial scalar product @xmath23 .",
    "however this hermitian structure need not be invariant under the transformations we are dealing with .    in the next section we review few relevant results scattered in the existing literature",
    ", they were motivated by the search for stability criteria for infinite dimensional systems@xcite ( compare the paragraph after formula eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) of the introduction ) .",
    "inspired by condition 3 ) of the above proposition 1 we may consider an automorphism @xmath40  of a hilbert space @xmath22 with a hermitian scalar product @xmath23 and construct the orbits @xmath41 and require that all of them , with respect to the norm induced by @xmath23 , are bounded sets for any value of @xmath35 .",
    "the use of the principle of uniform boundedness@xcite shows that this is equivalent to require that @xmath40 is uniformly bounded .",
    "we recall that the automorphism @xmath40 on @xmath22 is said to be uniformly bounded if there exists an upper bound @xmath42 such that @xmath43 condition ( [ unifbound ] ) is called nagy criterion .",
    "for such an operator @xmath44 the following theorem@xcite holds :    for a uniformly bounded operator @xmath40  there exists a bounded positive selfadjoint transformation @xmath45 such that @xmath46 and @xmath47  is unitary with respect to the fiducial @xmath23 .",
    "this implies that @xmath48 @xmath49 is unitary with respect to @xmath50    ( sketch ) the essential idea of the proof is to define the invariant scalar product @xmath51 as the limit , for @xmath52 going to infinity , of @xmath53 this is the limit of a bounded sequence of complex numbers which does not exist in general , at least in the usual sense .",
    "therefore a generalized concept of limit for bounded sequence , introduced by banach and mazur@xcite , has to be used .",
    "this generalized limit ( denoted as @xmath54 ) amounts to define the invariant scalar product @xmath55 as the transformed scalar product @xmath56  at infinity ",
    ", where @xmath40 is interpreted as the generator of a @xmath57action on @xmath22 .    it is possible@xcite to use the same approach to deal with an @xmath58action instead of the @xmath59action so that :    when the one - parameter group of automorphisms @xmath60 of linear transformations is uniformly bounded , that is @xmath61 there exists a bounded selfadjoint transformation @xmath45 such that @xmath62 is a one - parameter group of  unitary transformations",
    ". clearly continuity properties with respect to @xmath63 are the same for both @xmath60 and @xmath64 .    *",
    "* remark.**the iterated application of the uniformly bounded operator @xmath44 may be viewed as a discrete time evolution , which , according to theorem 2 , can be made unitary . here",
    "we note that such a discrete time evolution may be fitted within a continuous differentiable time evolution .",
    "we have the following    if @xmath40 is a uniformly bounded operator then there exists a bounded operator @xmath8 , selfadjoint with respect to the invariant product @xmath65 such that @xmath66 for any @xmath67",
    ".    from theorem 2 we know that @xmath40 is @xmath68unitary so that it can be written as    @xmath69    where @xmath70 is the uniquely defined spectral family for @xmath40 with the property @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    now define @xmath73  , so that @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75the operator @xmath8 is of course @xmath68selfadjoint , bounded and defined on the entire hilbert space .    of course",
    ", the one - dimensional unitary group @xmath76 is a continuous one - parameter group containing the discrete subgroup @xmath77 and moreover all orbits @xmath78 , for any @xmath79 , are differentiable in @xmath80 and solve  the schroedinger equation for @xmath81 it is possible to go from one - parameter groups of transformations to finitely - many - parameters groups of transformations if they define an abelian group .",
    "the following theorem ( see for instance ref . 20 ) holds :    a uniformly bounded action on @xmath22 of an abelian group @xmath82 , i.e. @xmath83 can be turned into a unitary action with the help of a bounded selfadjoint transformation @xmath84 i.e. @xmath85 are unitary transformations for any @xmath86 .",
    "the proof of this theorem can not use the idea of the generalized banach limit , like in the previous more restricted cases , because no assumptions are made on the structure and the topology of @xmath82 .",
    "in fact , the proof relies on a very general result on the existence of fixed points for any continuous transformation of convex sets ( ref .",
    "21 , 22 , see also ref .",
    "23 ) .    for practical purposes ,",
    "when nagy condition is not easy to check , some equivalent conditions may be used ( see ref .",
    "24 , 25 ) .",
    "it has been shown that nagy condition eq .",
    "( [ unifbound ] ) is equivalent to @xmath87 where @xmath88 . by using the cayley",

    "the commutativity hypothesis is crucial.@xcite in the non commutative case one needs necessarily some other assumptions , for instance that @xmath82 is a ( representation of a ) compact group .",
    "then the existence of the invariant haar measure guarantees that @xmath82 is similar to a unitary representation .    in section 9",
    ", we discuss an application of theorems 2 and 3 to the heisenberg group , a very special case of non - commutativity .",
    "in the following we will be concerned mainly with theorems 2 and 3 .",
    "all the examples that follows are applications of theorem 2 and refer to operators which are not _",
    "normal_. this is so because of the following corollary to nagy s theorem 2 :    a normal operator @xmath40 either is already unitary or it is not similar to any unitary operator .",
    "equivalently : a normal operator @xmath40 is unitary if and only if it satisfies the nagy condition .    when @xmath40 is normal the operators appearing in its polar decomposition , @xmath92 commute , so that @xmath93 satisfies nagy s condition eq .",
    "( [ unifbound ] ) together with @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath93 is both similar to a unitary operator and positive selfadjoint .",

    "if the limit @xmath101 exists , say @xmath102 then it is trivial to compute the banach limit because it agrees with a limit in the usual sense .",

    "we will see this in the next section .",
    "starting with the automorphism @xmath40 , we may investigate for the existence of alternative hermitian structures invariant under the @xmath59group action generated by @xmath167 such a @xmath40 could than be said to be a bi - unitary map .",
    "assume therefore that @xmath40 is uniformly bounded .",
    "for the time being we assume in addition that @xmath40 is diagonalizable and multiplicity free ( i.e. the commutant of @xmath40 is abelian@xcite ) .",
    "choose then a bounded transformation @xmath168 with bounded inverse such that @xmath169 where @xmath170 is unitary .",
    "theorem 2 guarantees that at least one such @xmath168 exists",
    ". then @xmath171 turns @xmath40 into a unitary operator .",
    "because of the uniformly boundedness of @xmath44 , we may also use the banach limit @xmath172 to define a new invariant hermitian structure .    by using an @xmath173orthonormal basis @xmath174 of eigenvectors of @xmath170 @xmath175 we find by explicit computation of the banach limit : @xmath176 while : @xmath177    we see that the invariant banach scalar product @xmath55 is obtained from @xmath178 scaling each @xmath179 by a factor @xmath180 notice that any bounded sequence of positive numbers can be used in the same way to scale @xmath179 to obtain alternative invariant scalar products .",
    "thus the sequence @xmath181 corresponds to @xmath182 while @xmath183 to @xmath153 .    if the eigenvalues of @xmath170  are not multiplicity free we need another index @xmath184 to label eigenvectors ; then eq . ( [ blim ] ) becomes    @xmath185    as in the multiplicity free case one obtains invariant scalar products replacing @xmath186 with any bounded sequence of positive matrices .",
    "what we learn from this example is that we can look for alternative hermitian structures on each eigenspace of @xmath170 and then combine them with arbitrary positive coupling coefficients provided that bounded vectors remain bounded with respect to the newly defined products ( boundedness of the sequence ) . in this respect",
    "see our previous paper@xcite where similar considerations came out within the finite dimensional situation .",
    "in particular this procedure shows that we may start with @xmath23 already invariant and construct @xmath168 out of constants of the motion for @xmath187 in this way we would obtain alternative descriptions whenever the sequence @xmath188 @xmath189 is appropriate . for instance in a central force problem @xmath190 in a basis for the angular momentum , would give @xmath191 and @xmath192 @xmath193 $ ]  would be an appropriate sequence .",
    "* remark * from what we said , it is clear that instead of a once - for - all chosen sequence of bounded positive numbers ( for instance like @xmath181 and @xmath194 ) we could use a  point - dependent  sequence so that the hermitian metric we define will be dependent on the point and therefore the  energy function  we associate with linear transformations will not be quadratic anymore.@xcite in this way , vector fields are still linear and therefore compatible with the dynamical linear superposition rule for state vectors , however the associated hamiltonian functions ( infinitesimal generators ) are no more homogeneous of degree two .",
    "one is getting a kind of  non - linearity  , one should compare this situation with the one proposed by weinberg.@xcite    having learned from the diagonalizable case , we can obtain a class of invariant scalar products dropping this assumption .",

    "we consider operators @xmath216 , @xmath213 , @xmath268 uniformly bounded and obeying the following commutation relations @xmath269 and @xmath270    for @xmath216 , @xmath213 , @xmath268 satisfying the stated conditions it is possible to find a hermitian structure that converts them into unitary operators .",
    "there is a scalar product , say @xmath271 , that makes @xmath216 and @xmath268 unitary since they commute and are uniformly bounded ; in this scalar product @xmath213 will not be unitary in general .",
    "consider therefore @xmath272 this scalar product @xmath18 makes @xmath213 unitary and one checks easily that it leaves unitary @xmath216 and @xmath268 as well .",

    "we will show the use of this proposition , to compare alternative weyl systems when they are considered on the same hilbert space .",
    "let us recall that for a complex hilbert space @xmath22 with hermitian structure @xmath18 it is possible to define a symplectic structure by setting @xmath274    given a symplectic vector space @xmath275 we may define a poisson bracket on @xmath276 by defining it first on linear functions and then by using the leibnitz rule on all differentiable functions @xmath277 .",
    "on @xmath278 we set @xmath279 where on the left hand side @xmath280 and on the right @xmath281 .",
    "more directly , on any totally reflexive space@xcite , it is possible to define a non - degenerate poisson bracket if the space is strongly symplectic.@xcite indeed introducing differentials of functions @xmath282 in intrinsic form at each point @xmath283 we define @xmath284    in our setting @xmath17 is a hilbert space and therefore there is a non intrinsic isomorphism between @xmath17 and @xmath276 so that we have a poisson bracket defined also on @xmath285 it follows easily that a complex unitary linear transformation @xmath170 on @xmath22 is symplectic .",
    "a densely defined complex linear operator @xmath13 is a hamiltonian vector field iff @xmath286 is hermitian .",
    "the hamiltonian function associated with @xmath13 is given by the formula @xmath287 thus , we associate an hamiltonian function ( infinitesimal generating function ) with any vector field which preserves the hermitian structure @xmath18 .    disregarding domain problems , for the moment ,",
    "it is easy to show that if @xmath288 are hermitian operators , the associated hamiltonian functions , say @xmath289 satisfy the poisson bracket relations @xmath290}(\\psi ) \\ \\ \\ .\\ ] ] it is now possible to investigate the consequence of the existence of alternative invariant hermitian structures . with the notation of theorem 2",
    ", we have a new poisson bracket defined by @xmath291 these new metrics will associate alternative quadratic functions with every operator @xmath81 all of the induced poisson bracket on quadratic functions will be pairwise compatible in the sense of bi - hamiltonian systems . in the ehrenfest description of quantum dynamics , we have @xmath292 and therefore the same vector field will be given different hamiltonian descriptions , with @xmath293  and the poisson bracket depending on the chosen invariant metric .",
    "the relation @xmath294 , between two invariant hermitian forms , suggests the correspondence between operators @xmath295    according to the ref .",
    "32 , we may define a new associative product on the space of operators @xmath296 which gives @xmath297 any time that @xmath157 is a constant of the motion for @xmath298 as in this case , we obtain a new alternative associative product on the space of operators which makes @xmath10 into an inner derivation .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown how alternative hamiltonian descriptions for the schroedinger equation give rise to alternative description in the ehrenfest picture and the heisenberg picture .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of alternative quantum hamiltonian descriptions of the same vector field on the space of quantum states . in this way we have avoided dealing with the ambiguity of quantization procedures for classical bi - hamiltonian systems .",
    "we have briefly addressed the question of the alternative descriptions at the level of the ehrenfest picture and heisenberg picture . by using this results , in the future we shall consider the quantum - classical transition to show how these alternative description at the quantum level will reproduce known alternative hamiltonian descriptions for the corresponding classical systems .",
