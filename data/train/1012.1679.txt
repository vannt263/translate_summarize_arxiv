    "one of the characteristics of a superfluid is the quantization of vortices that are found when sufficient angular momentum is present in the system .",
    "vortices , as a signature of superfluidity , are therefore of great theoretical and experimental interest , and the reader is referred to the recent review article by fetter @xcite .",
    "our model is based on the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) formalism @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate how the continuity equation for the condensate density , solved self - consistently with a set of time - independent orthogonalized hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations in the frame rotating at the precessional frequency , can be used to make _ a priori _ predictions of the precessional frequencies of vortices in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . by introducing a set of modified basis functions incorporating the vortex positions",
    "one is able to do this not only for single off - axis vortices , but also for the multiple vortex case . in order to perform these calculations correctly , it is necessary that the condensate and thermal populations be mutually orthogonal .",
    "we present an orthogonal hfb formalism in which this condition holds , and for which we show the existence of a zero - energy eigenvalue in the time - independent case , in contrast with the standard hfb formalism . as an illustration we model a two - dimensional bec system , establishing the dependency of the precessional frequency @xmath0 on the lattice parameter @xmath1 and on the temperature @xmath2 for triangular and hexagonal vortex arrays .",
    "we also show the relationship of @xmath0 with @xmath2 for the case of two vortices and for triangular and hexagonal vortex arrays with three and seven vortices , respectively , having lattice parameter @xmath3 harmonic oscillator units , establishing the existence of an upper bound for the precessional frequency as a function of the number of vortices .",
    "we obtain qualitative agreement with the areal density approximation @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the hexagonal vortex array .",
    "we verify the validity of these predictions in a series of finite temperature simulations using time - dependent hfb @xcite .",
    "we use one or more gaussian stirrers to impart angular momentum to the bec , and establish a critical stirring frequency required for the creation of vortices corresponding to a local stirring velocity just in excess of the local landau critical velocity .",
    "we also verify that the axial component of the angular momentum is conserved when the trapping potential is axially symmetric , thus satisfying noether s theorem .",
    "we show that angular momentum is lost when this symmetry is broken , leading to the decay of vortices .",
    "we consider a bec system in the frame rotating with angular frequency @xmath4 with grand - canonical bose hamiltonian given by@xmath5.\\end{array}\\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the single - particle hamiltonian@xmath7 and@xmath8 with @xmath9 the @xmath10-wave scattering length .",
    "we wish to obtain an hfb formalism such that the condensate and thermal modes are orthogonal .",
    "we proceed by splitting the bose field operator @xmath11 into a coherent part represented by the condensate field operator @xmath12 , and an incoherent part represented by the fluctuation operator @xmath13 , writing @xmath14 with @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the annihilation operator for the condensate , and @xmath17 a condensate wave function satisfying the normalization condition @xmath18 the fluctuation operator @xmath13 is defined as @xcite @xmath19 .",
    "it can then be shown that the orthogonality condition@xmath20 holds , so the condensate and thermal populations are orthogonal , as required .",
    "we also find from the definition of @xmath21 that @xmath22 in addition @xmath23 and @xmath21 satisfy the commutation relations@xmath24=\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t),\\\\ \\left[\\hat{\\phi}(\\mathbf{r},t),\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\right]=\\left[\\hat{\\phi}^{\\dag}(\\mathbf{r},t),\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dag}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\right]=0\\end{array}\\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] and@xmath25=\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})-\\phi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\equiv q(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t),\\\\ \\left[\\hat{\\eta}(\\mathbf{r},t),\\hat{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\right]=\\left[\\hat{\\eta}^{\\dag}(\\mathbf{r},t),\\hat{\\psi}^{\\dag}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\right]=0\\end{array}\\label{eq:7}\\ ] ] respectively .",

    "clearly @xmath66 and @xmath67 represent the usual thermal and anomalous densities . to prove eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) , we note using results from vector calculus , that we can write @xcite @xmath68 provided we choose@xmath69 thus ensuring that angular and linear momentum are conserved . since standard hfb is a @xmath41-derivable , and hence a conserving , theory , particle number and both angular and linear momentum conservation hold for standard hfb .",
    "it can be shown that particle number , and both angular and linear momentum conservation also hold for this formalism , the latter being ensured by the inclusion of the operator @xmath70 in ( [ eq:16 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding time - independent equations are given by the modified ggpe@xmath71 and the orthogonal bdges@xmath72 where the operators @xmath73 and @xmath70 are now time independent .",
    "to show the existence of a null subspace of zero - energy eigenvalue modes for the orthogonal bdges ( [ eq:23b ] ) spanned by the mode @xmath74 , let us write @xmath75 , @xmath76 for some @xmath77 , where @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is normalized to unity , i.e.,@xmath80 then , substituting @xmath81 , @xmath82 into the first of the modified time - independent bdges ( [ eq:23b ] ) , we find that@xmath83\\\\   & = & \\alpha\\mathcal{\\hat{l}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\phi(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})-\\beta\\mathcal{\\hat{m}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})\\\\   &   & -\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\int d\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\left[\\alpha\\mathcal{\\hat{l}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\phi(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})-\\beta\\mathcal{\\hat{m}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})\\right].\\end{array}\\ ] ] multiplying both sides by @xmath38 , and integrating over all space , we find [ in view of the orthonormality of @xmath41 and of the orthogonality condition ( [ eq:5 ] ) ] that@xmath84\\\\   &   & -\\phi(\\mathbf{r})\\int d\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime}\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r})\\left[\\alpha\\mathcal{\\hat{l}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\phi(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})-\\beta\\mathcal{\\hat{m}}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},t)\\phi^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime})\\right]\\\\   & = & 0.\\end{array}\\ ] ] we have thus shown in the time - independent case for this formalism that there exists a zero - energy eigenvalue .",
    "however , the existence of a zero - energy eigenvalue does not imply that the pine - hugenholtz theorem @xcite is satisfied or indeed that this corresponds to the goldstone mode , nor is the remainder of the energy spectrum `` corrected , '' and is quite similar to the standard hfb spectrum in spite of the existence of a zero - energy eigenvalue .",
    "we now obtain from the modified ggpe ( [ eq:16 ] ) , the continuity equation for the condensate density@xmath85 where@xmath86 is the current density , and where we have defined the quantity@xmath87 with@xmath88 and use this to find an expression for the precessional frequencies of off - axis vortices and vortex arrays in quasi - two - dimensional becs . to do this",
    "we consider a stationary vortex system in the frame rotating at the precessional frequency of the vortex or vortices .",

    "we use the dimensionless units @xmath100 for the length scale , and @xmath101 for the time scale , and express the condensate wave function and quasiparticle amplitudes in units of @xmath102 .",

    "the converged solution then represents a stationary solution in the rotating frame , and @xmath0 corresponds to the precessional frequency of the off - axis vortex or vortex array .    a vortex at position @xmath118 may be created by expanding the condensate wave function in terms of modified laguerre basis functions @xmath119 as follows :    define@xmath120 where @xmath121 , then@xmath122 provided @xmath118 is not a root of @xmath123 , where we define@xmath124 with@xmath125 and @xmath126 a modified laguerre polynomial of order @xmath127 .",
    "the superscript in the representation of the modified basis function , indicates a single vortex .",
    "this is motivated simply by expanding the condensate wave function in terms of the complete laguerre basis @xmath128 and considering that @xmath129 .",

    "we find that @xmath133 , hence we can write @xmath134 in the form ( [ eq:41 ] ) .",

    "we illustrate the method by considering a dilute bose gas consisting of 2000 @xmath140atoms in an axially symmetric harmonic trap , with radial and axial harmonic trapping frequencies of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "thus the axial confinement is sufficiently strong that all excited axial states may be neglected , hence the axial ( @xmath99 ) component can then be integrated out , and the bec may effectively be treated as two - dimensional . in order for this quasi - two - dimensional approximation to hold , we require that the axial harmonic transition energy @xmath143 be much greater than the temperature @xmath2 and the mean - field energy of the bec @xcite . here the axial harmonic energy transition corresponds to a temperature of @xmath144 , and the mean - field energy to an effective temperature of @xmath145 , where @xmath65 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath146 in all these simulations the bec temperature @xmath147 , so this approximation is justified .",
