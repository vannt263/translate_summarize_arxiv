    "at the beginning of 17th century , galileo galilei turned his small telescope towards the sun and noticed the dark regions on sun s surface now called sunspots .",
    "the larger telescopes built subsequently revealed that sunspots have different structures like dark region called umbra and less dark with filamentary structures called penumbra .",
    "as the technology improved in 20th century , bigger telescopes were built to observe the characteristic features which include the light bridge across sunspots @xcite , moving magnetic features around sunspots @xcite , supergranulation network and its elements @xcite etc .",
    "most of these observations have been done using about 50 cm class telescopes or smaller . from the theoretical calculations , the size of the elementary building blocks ( size of the flux tube ) of magnetic structures , for example ,",
    "is estimated to be about 70 km .",
    "a large aperture telescope with diameter of 2 m or more is therefore , necessary to resolve important and intriguing features of the solar atmosphere at smaller scales .",
    "additionally , the photon starved polarization measurements , crucial to estimate the magnetic fields distribution and strength in the active regions on the sun , are hard to come by from small telescopes .",
    "the next generation , large aperture ( 2 m and above ) solar telescopes equipped with adaptive optics and supported by advanced backend instruments , will be able to probe the solar atmosphere at unprecedented details and thus help solving many outstanding problems in solar physics .",
    "some of the notable solar facilities planned for the future are : a 4 m advanced technology solar telescope ( atst ) to be build by national solar observatory @xcite , national large solar telescope ( nlst ) proposed by indian institute of astrophysics , india @xcite , and a soon to be commissioned 1.5 m gregor telescope by a consortia led kiepenheuer - institute , germany @xcite .    the design and construction of a solar telescope is considerably different from a typical night - time telescope . among others ,",
    "the most formidable task is to build an efficient temperature control system capable of handling the large amount of heat generated by the intense solar radiation .",
    "the immense difficulty of the heat management problem has been a major bottleneck in constructing large aperture primary mirror for solar studies .",
    "evidently , by the time largest solar telescope ( 4 m atst ) starts its operation , the night - time astronomy would have leap - frogged to next generation of 20 - 40 m class telescopes .    besides the direct heating caused by light absorption ,",
    "the diurnal temperature variations of ambient air are also crucial in driving the thermal response of the telescope mirror . the rise or fall in mirror temperature with respect to ambient ,",
    "adversely affect the imaging performance of the telescope in two major ways .",
    "first , when the mirror is at different temperature than the surrounding , a thin layer with a temperature gradient is formed closed to the mirror surface and air .",
    "the temperature fluctuations in the surface layer lead to the variations in the refractive index of the air that produce wavefront aberrations @xcite .",
    "the final image is blurred as the telescope beam passes through this layer twice .",
    "the second detrimental effects of heating or cooling is the structural deformations of the mirror arising from thermally induced stress and temperature inhomogeneities within the substrate volume @xcite .",
    "any deviation from the nominal temperature distorts the mirror surface from its desired shape .",
    "thermally induced surface imperfections therefore , deteriorate the final image quality of the telescope .    to minimize the effect of mirror seeing , the temperature difference between the ambient air and the mirror surface should be maintained within a very narrow ( @xmath0c ) range @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the temperature difference across the reflecting face of the mirror should not exceed @xmath1 . for night - time astronomy",
    ", the temperature of the mirror and telescope dome can be effectively controlled by air conditioning system during the day @xcite .",
    "blowing cool air over the mirror surface is helpful in mitigating the mirror seeing effects .",
    "forced air flow breaks the thermal plumes closed to the mirror surface and thus homogenize the temperature gradients which otherwise drive the refractive index fluctuations leading to image degradation @xcite .",
    "the induced air flow also improves the convective heat transfer rate and thereby reducing the temperature difference between the mirror material and the surrounding air . for effective cooling",
    ", the air temperature and speed have to be regulated according to the temperature profile of the mirror surface . however , the accurate measurements of the temperature of the mirror require an array of temperature sensors placed close to the reflecting face of the mirror which is not just difficult but impractical during the scientific observations .",
    "in such a case , numerical simulations are the only viable solution to predict the temperature profile of the mirror surface .    in another approach , a ` cool reservoir ' is created by lowering the the mirror temperature well below the temperature expected for the night observations .",
    "a near thermal equilibrium with ambient is accomplished in a resistive heating by passing electrical current through reflective coating on the front surface of the mirror @xcite .",
    "this approach does not quite suit the solar observations as the primary mirror is directly heated by sun s radiation .",
    "the effect of mirror seeing is even more severe if the same telescope is later switched to night - time observations . to avoid large heat loads and thermal gradients , ideally a substrate material should have low heat capacity and high thermal conductivity .    among traditional materials used in primary mirror substrates , ultra low expansion ( ule )",
    "glass ceramics such as zerodur and fused silica have gained wide acceptance among astronomical community @xcite .",
    "the semiconducting sic is another important material that is beginning to find a niche in astronomy @xcite .",
    "in addition to its low thermal expansion coefficient , high hardness and rigidity , sic has exceptionally high thermal conductivity which is about two order of magnitude higher than the other materials . for large size telescopes ,",
    "the lightweighted mirror geometry is preferred to reduce the overall weight and thermal inertia of the system .",
    "the reduced mass facilitates efficient and faster cooling necessary for the mirror to reach the thermal equilibrium with surroundings quickly .",
    "however , lightweighting is a complex , time consuming and often an expensive process . with a good thermal control system , a classical primary mirror of diameter not exceeding 2 m",
    "could possibly be used without lightweighting .    for a given shape and geometry of the mirror ,",
    "the analytical solutions become intractable . therefore , in traditional engineering practice , the thermal response of such a mirror blank is studied by finite element methods ( fem ) @xcite . the heat transfer problem described by a diffusion - type partial differential equation ,",
    "is numerically solved to obtain a steady - state solutions for a constant temperature typically found at telescope location .",
    "in addition , the mirror heating is modeled assuming fixed heat flux and fixed ambient air temperature which serves as the boundary conditions . the time scale for a mirror to reach a thermal equilibrium is of the order of few days while the ambient air temperature changes significantly in course of the day @xcite .",
    "this means , the usual mirror substrate with large heat capacity can never reach the thermal equilibrium with ambient unless some external cooling is used .",
    "the static analysis is not enough to determine the level of accuracy and other parameters of interest ( e.g. level of wind flushing or ventilation points etc ) necessary for designing an efficient thermal control system .",
    "a complete time dependent solution of 3d heat transfer problem under the varying solar flux and ambient temperature is therefore necessary to evaluate the mirror performance , a problem which we address in the present paper .    in this paper , we have solved the 3d heat transfer and structural model that takes into account the ambient thermal conditions existing at the telescope site .",
    "the location dependent solar flux and ambient heating model is incorporated into commercially available finite element analysis software to investigate the time dependent thermal and structural response of 2 m class primary mirror .",
    "these numerical simulations are carried out at four different ambient temperature range , representative of mild to extreme thermal variations that may occur at different observatory locations around the world .",
    "the general heat flow problem involves all three modes of heat transfer , namely conduction , convection , and radiation .",
    "the reflecting face coated with a thin metallic layer absorbs about 10 - 15% of the total solar flux incident on the mirror surface . the heat generated as a result of absorption of optical energy",
    "is diffused to other parts of the mirror via conduction and partly lost to the surroundings via convective and radiative processes .",
    "the temperature of the mirror rises when the heat produced by light absorption exceeds the overall heat loss to surroundings .",
    "the general heat transfer problem can be cast into the partial differential equation of the form @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are density , temperature , thermal conductivity and heat capacity of the material .",
    "the terms @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the velocity field and heat source , respectively .",
    "most of the material properties are temperature dependent .",
    "the boundary condition for the heat flux to be maintained at the surface can be written as : @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the inward heat flux at the mirror surface , @xmath11 is the ambient air temperature , @xmath12 is the effective radiation temperature of the surroundings , @xmath13 is surface emissivity , @xmath14 is the stefan - boltzmann constant and @xmath15 is the heat transfer coefficient indicating the rate at which heat is exchanged between the mirror and the surroundings .",
    "the 2nd and the 3rd terms in eq.(2 ) are statements of newton s law of cooling and stefan - boltzmann s law , accounting for the heat loss by free convection and radiation , respectively .",
    "the diurnal and annual temperature variations is one of the important criteria for selecting a suitable observatory site .",
    "it also plays a vital role in determining the degrading effects of atmospheric turbulence , mirror seeing and structural stability of the telescope . the earth s surface is mainly heated by the irradiated solar energy during the day .",
    "the sun s light also contains the spectral signatures of both solar and terrestrial atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the amount and duration of the solar radiation @xmath16 reaching the earth s surface is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the flux amplitude when sun is at zenith , and @xmath19 is the solar zenith angle which is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is latitude of the place , @xmath22 is declination angle of the sun , @xmath23 is the solar hour angle with respect to noon and @xmath24 is the local time .    the exact nature of daily temperature variations at a given location , however , depends on the local weather conditions ( pressure , wind speed , humidity etc ) , surface topography , soil type , vegetation , and the presence of water body etc .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple physics - based model to describe the thermal heating of the earth s surface in cloud free conditions . according to this model , the day - time rise in temperature @xmath25 due to the sun and the night - time cooling @xmath26",
    "can be described by @xmath27\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\textrm{for}\\quad \\;\\;t < t_s \\\\",
    "t_{2}(t)\\!&=&\\!s(t_{0}+\\delta t ) + s\\left\\{t_{a } \\cos\\left[\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}(t-\\tau_m)\\right]-\\delta t \\right\\ }   \\textrm{e}^{-\\frac{t - t_s}{\\kappa } }      \\;\\;\\textrm{for } \\;\\;t \\geq t_s \\;\\;\\ ;      \\label{eqs56 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for heating part , the choice of harmonic term in eq.(5 ) is based on the solution of equation of thermal diffusion @xcite , while the exponential term in eq.(6 ) accounts for the temperature fall in accordance to the newton s law of cooling .",
    "the constant @xmath28 is included to account for the thermal time lag between the peak solar flux and the peak ambient temperature during the day .",
    "the meaning and values of various parameters in eq.(5 ) and eq.(6 ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".model parameters and the values for eqs.[eqs56 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the primary mirror heating caused by the light absorption is a complex and challenging problem .",
    "the thermal performance of a solar telescope mirror needs to be accurately predicted under real observing conditions .",
    "this is essential to design an efficient and durable temperature control system devised to mitigate the detrimental effects of excessive heating during the day .",
    "we have outlined an approach to study the thermal and structural response of a primary mirror under varying observing conditions . in the fem model for a 2 m class primary mirror , the location dependent solar flux and a simple physics based heating and cooling model of the ambient air temperature",
    "was incorporated .",
    "the spatial and temporal evolution of temperature field inside two well known materials for optical telescope , silicon carbide ( sic ) and zerodur , were examined using 3d numerical simulations .",
    "the low thermal conductivity of zerodur mirror gives rise to strong radial and axial temperature gradients that are quite distinct for the day - time heating and night - time cooling .",
    "heat loss by free convection is very slow so the mirror retain significant heat during the night .",
    "the thermal response of the sic mirror is significantly different from the zerodur .",
    "the temperature within the sic mirror substrate equilibrates rather quickly due to high thermal conductivity .",
    "the absence of thermal gradients and the advantage of high thermal conductivity of sic can not be favorably leveraged without some temperature regulation by external means .",
    "thermal distortions of the mirror were analyzed using the structural fem model .",
    "high surface distortion seems to result if the operating temperature of the mirror deviates significantly from the nominal temperature of the material . in extremely low cte materials",
    ", the mirror seeing ultimately limits the telescope performance .",
    "it is not the high temperature alone , but the relative incremental change in ambient air temperature and the mirror which contribute most to the ` seeing effect ' .",
    "large temperature changes in ambient air and slow thermal response of the glass materials invariably results in bad seeing . in order to augment the scientific productivity of a solar telescope ,",
    "there have been some suggestions from the astronomers about the possibility of utilizing the same telescope for limited , but useful night - time observations .",
    "a site with minimum diurnal changes in day - night temperature ( e.g. 0 - 5@xmath29 c ) would ideally suit for such dual purpose observations .",
    "we have only considered the thermal gradients and surface distortions in solid mirror which would be quite different for the lightweighted mirror made of same materials .",
    "the most conspicuous fallout of the different cell geometries and side walls structure is the appearance of thermal footprint in the surface distortions",
    ". this would be the subject matter of future work .",
    "we thank dr s. chatterjee for several discussions and valuable suggestions that helped us to improve the form and content of the manuscripts .",
