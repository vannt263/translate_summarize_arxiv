    "the doppler shift energy for nodal qps depends on the directions of the fermi velocity near the nodes and the supercurrent , namely the relative orientation of the nodal position and field direction .",
    "therefore , the nodal positions are determined by modulation of the zdos under rotating magnetic field . in low field region ,",

    "6(b ) calculated with the kpa , @xmath157 and @xmath158 at @xmath159 , where @xmath160 is the polar angle giving the maximum of the zdos .",
    "thus , although the min structure is marginal to the detection in experiments , the flat - bottomed zdos around the node will be observed at least . the smaller min structure near a linear line node shown in fig .  5 can be hardly detected except on a cigar type fermi surface .",
    "the heavy fermion superconductor upd@xmath3al@xmath4 has been investigated by shimizu _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite this is a good system to check our proposal .",
    "the experimental data of the @xmath0 rotation of the specific heat @xmath161 at lower temperatures exhibit the following characteristics in the oscillation patterns : ( 1 ) in low fields the oscillation patterns of @xmath161 show a maximum at @xmath162 and monotonically decreases towards @xmath102 . ( 2 ) the maximum of the oscillation patterns at @xmath162 gradually moves to higher angles with increasing field .",
    "thus there appear two local minima at @xmath162 and @xmath102 .",
    "( 3 ) in further high fields this maximum reaches at @xmath102 .",
    "the oscillation pattern becomes a monotonic curve whose minimum ( maximum ) situated at @xmath162 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "thus the oscillation pattern is reversed between lower field and higher field ones .",
    "those three characteristics observed in upd@xmath3al@xmath4 are all reproduced by the present calculations for the horizontal linear line node case shown in fig .",
    "thus we can conclude that the nodal structure of upd@xmath3al@xmath4 has a linear line node at least by the following reasons : ( i ) according to shimizu _ et al .",
    "_ ,  @xcite the azimuthal angle @xmath163 rotation of @xmath161 exhibits no detectable oscillation , indicating that there is no vertical line node .",
    "( ii ) since the local minima or flat bottom near @xmath102 is not observed , horizontal node must be a linear line node , rather than a quadratic one .",
    "( iii ) as for the possible point nodes at the poles , it is difficult to discern the local minima at @xmath162 in view of the accuracy of the experimental data .",
    "thus we can not say whether there exists points nodes at the poles or not .    from these arguments",
    ", we may conclude that the chiral @xmath164-wave pairing @xmath165 is most likely .",
    "it is fortunate that the whole oscillation patterns predicted by the present calculations are realized in upd@xmath3al@xmath4 .",
    "one possible reason is the small @xmath13 anisotropy @xmath166 in this system .",
    "kittaka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have performed the @xmath0 rotation of the specific heat experiment on a heavy fermion superconductor uru@xmath3si@xmath3 . in low fields",
    "the oscillation patterns exhibit a maximum at @xmath162 and a minimum at @xmath102 . as the field increases , a shoulder or kink structure appears at @xmath167 , reminiscent of the local maximum associated with the horizontal line node as seen from fig .",
    "upon further increasing field , the oscillation pattern becomes a simple monotonic one with the maximum at @xmath162 .",
    "this simple pattern persists up to @xmath168 .",
    "the absence of the oscillation pattern reversal is due to the strong @xmath13 anisotropy where @xmath168 is suppressed by the pauli paramagnetic effect .",
    "this resembles the case explained in sec .",
    "iii.b.1 where the crossing field disappears because the elongated fermi surface makes the crossing field move to higher field .",
    "nevertheless , it is remarkable to observe the shoulder structure , which comes from the nodal gap structure associated with a horizontal line node .",
    "since there are no local minima or flat bottom near @xmath143 , the quadratic line node is unlikely .",
    "thus the chiral @xmath164-wave @xmath165 is the most probable pairing state .",
    "recently the angle resolved specific heat experiment on a possible topological superconductor cu@xmath5bi@xmath3se@xmath4 has been reported and concluded that the two point nodes or gap minima exist on the @xmath169-direction .",
    "@xcite by the exchange between the @xmath170- and @xmath169-directions , this situation is identical to our point node model shown in fig .",
    "as mentioned , if the point nodes exist on the fermi sphere , the oscillation patterns must be reversed as the field varies .",
    "in addition , the local minima may appears at @xmath162 for the quadratic point node case .",
    "neither those features were observed by yonezawa _",
    "_ ,  @xcite where the same oscillation patterns persists for all fields up to @xmath171 in low temperatures .",
    "thus although the observation of the two - fold oscillation pattern for the basal plane in the hexagonal crystal is remarkable whose origin remains unknown , we can not support their conclusion that this two - fold oscillation is due to the point nodes or gap minima from the present calculations .",
    "since the oscillation patterns are independent of the field value , it simply comes from the @xmath171 anisotropy within the basal plane probed .      on the multi - phased heavy fermion superconductor upt@xmath4 ,",
    "the field angle resolved thermal conductivity measurement has been performed .",
    "@xcite in addition to the remarkable two - fold oscillation patterns for the basal plane in the c - phase , the minima of the thermal conductivity are clearly observed at @xmath172 and @xmath173 in the b- and c - phases [ see fig .  3 in ref .",
    "] . this may be an indication of the quadratic point nodes  @xcite or the off - symmetric line nodes .",
    "we have proposed a spectroscopic method to probe the nodal gap structure and to pinpoint a nodal position in momentum space by measuring the polar angle resolved zdos @xmath1 via specific heat or thermal conductivity at low @xmath174 .",
    "the method is based on detection of the zero energy quasi - particles accumulated in the gap nodes in momentum space or equivalently bounded in the vortex core in real space .",
    "the zdos @xmath1 exhibits the following features in a field range where the oscillation pattern is reversed : ( a ) `` max '' structure , the global maxima in @xmath1 drives this reversal , and ( b ) `` min '' structure , the local minima appear just near the angle of the nodal position in momentum space .",
    "those features are analyzed by quasiclassical eilenberger theory beyond a simple doppler shift picture and are explained clearly in terms of the microscopic quasi - particles with zero energy in momentum space .",
    "thus , polar angle resolved measurement provides information on the nodal structure in typical tetragonal or hexagonal superconductors in addition to temperature and field dependence of specific heat or thermal conductivity . unless the oscillation reversal of the zdos is wiped off by the fermi surface anisotropy , ( a ) the max structure and ( b ) the min structure or the flat - bottomed zdos around the node will be observed .",
    "it is our hope that this spectroscopic method helps determining the pairing symmetry through the nodal gap structure in various unconventional superconductors and pinpointing the momentum space position of dirac node and weyl node in newly coming topological superconductors .",
