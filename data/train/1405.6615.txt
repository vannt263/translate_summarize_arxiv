    "the study of non - perturbative methods for nonlinear differential equations is of considerable recent interest . among the various well known singular perturbation techniques such as multiple scale analysis , method of boundary layers , wkb method and so on @xcite , the recently developed homotopy analysis method ( ham ) @xcite and the renormalization group method ( rgm ) @xcite",
    "appear to be very attractive .",
    "the aim of these new improved methods is to derive in an unified manner uniformly valid asymptotic quantities of interest for a given nonlinear dynamical problem .",
    "although formulated almost parallely over the past decades or so , relative strength and weakness of these two approaches have yet to be investigated systematically .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to undertake a comparative study of ham and rgm in the context of the rayleigh equation@xmath2 and the van der pol equation@xmath3 where the dots are used to designate the derivative with respect to time @xmath4 .",
    "the rayleigh and the van der pol ( vdp ) equations represent two closely related nonlinear systems and have found significant applications in the study of self excited oscillations arising in biology , acoustics , robotics , engineering etc .",
    "@xcite . it is easy to observe that differentiating @xmath5 with respect to time @xmath4 and putting @xmath6 we obtain @xmath7 .",
    "both these systems have unique isolated periodic orbit ( limit cycle ) .",
    "the amplitude of a periodic oscillation @xmath8 @xmath9 is generally defined by @xmath10 @xmath11 over the entire cycle .",
    "it is well known that the naive perturbative solutions of these equations are useful when @xmath12 and yields the asymptotic value @xmath13 of the amplitude for the limit cycle correctly . for @xmath14 , simple analysis based on singular perturbation theory",
    "also yields the asymptotic amplitude for the relaxation oscillation as @xmath13 for the vdp equation .",
    "however , the conventional perturbative approaches fail when @xmath0 is finite .",
    "one of the aim of this paper is to determine efficient approximate formulae for the amplitude of the limit cycle for the above systems by both ham and rgm .",
    "lopez et al @xcite have reported an efficient formula for the amplitude of the vdp limit cycle by ham .",
    "we note here that a key difference in rayleigh and vdp oscillators is the fact that with increase in input energy ( voltage ) , the amplitude of the rayleigh periodic oscillation increases , when that of the vdp oscillator remains almost constant at the value 2 , with possible increase in the corresponding frequency only . for large @xmath15 relaxation oscillations , on the other hand ,",
    "the rayleigh system shows up a rather fast building up and slow subsequent release of internal energy , when the vdp models the reverse behaviour , with slow rise and fast drop in the accumulated energy .    as remarked above , ham and rgm",
    "are formulated to determine the uniformly valid global asymptotic behaviours of relevant dynamical quantities like amplitude , period , frequency etc .",
    "related to periodic solutions of these equations for finite values of @xmath0 , by devising efficient methods in eliminating divergent secular terms of the naive perturbation theory .",
    "ham seems to have the advantage of yielding uniformly convergent solutions of very high order in the nonlinearity parameter @xmath0 utilizing a freedom in the choice of a free parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the computation of higher order term could be facilitated by symbolic computational algorithms .",
    "this method is used to obtain good approximate solutions for the vdp equation by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "lopez et al @xcite derived efficient formulae for estimating the amplitude of the limit cycle of the vdp equation for all values of @xmath17 .",
    "although , ham is now considered to be an efficient method in the study of non - perturbative asymptotic analysis , it is recently pointed out @xcite that this method might fail even in some innocent looking nonlinear problems .",
    "the rgm , on the other hand , has a rich history , being originally formulated for managing divergences in the quantum field theory and later having deep applications in phase transitions and critical phenomena in statistical mechanics .",
    "subsequently , chen et al @xcite successfully translated the rg formalism into the study of nonlinear differential equations .",
    "it is noted that rgm is more efficient and accurate than conventional singular perturbative approaches in obtaining global informations from a naive perturbation series in @xmath0 .",
    "it is also recognized that rgm generated expansions yield @xmath0-dependent space / time scales naturally , when conventional approaches normally require invoking such scales in an ad hoc manner .",
    "the pertubative rgm , however , appears to have the limitation that the computation of higher order renormalized solutions could be quite involved and tedious .",
    "more serious is the inability of assuring the convergence of the renormalized expansions for large nonlinearity parameter .",
    "further , there is still no evidence in the literature that rgm could be employed successfully to asymptotic estimation of the amplitude of an isolated periodic orbit for all values of @xmath0 as was reported for ham @xcite .    here",
    "we report analytic expressions of the amplitude of the periodic solutions of both the rayleigh equation @xmath5 and the vdp equation @xmath18 as functions of @xmath19 .",
    "we have made a comparative study of these two sets of formulae using both ham and rgm .",
    "the ham contains a control parameter @xmath20 which controls the convergence of the approximation to the numerically computed exact value of the amplitude for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "suitable choice of @xmath16 can control the relative percentage error .",
    "the original rgm gives an approximation to the exact solution for small values of @xmath0 .",
    "we report here the rg solution upto order @xmath21 . to the authors knowledge this seems to be the first higher order computation other than second order computations reported so far by various authors @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the amplitude of the periodic cycle with the exact computations reveals that even the present higher order perturbative approximations fails to give accurate estimation for moderate values of @xmath0 . as the higher order rg computations are quite laborious and inefficient , it is very unlikely that higher order computations of amplitude would improve the quality of the estimated amplitude of the limit cycle",
    "further , in rgm one does not have the resource of a free parameter equivalent to @xmath22 of ham to improve the convergence of the rg expansions .",
    "a major contribution in the present study is to propose an _ improved _ rgm ( irgm ) . in irgm",
    ", we advocate the concept of _ nonlinear time _",
    "@xcite that extends the original rg idea of eliminating the divergent secular term of the form @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the initial time , of the naive perturbation series for the solution of the nonlinear problem , by exploiting the arbitrariness in fixing the initial moment @xmath24 .",
    "the original prescription rests on introducing new initial time @xmath25 in the form @xmath26 and to allow the renormalized amplitude @xmath27 and phase @xmath28 of the renormalized solution to depend on the new parameter , viz .",
    ", @xmath29 so that the original naive perturbative , constant values of amplitude @xmath30 and phase @xmath31 ( say ) ` flow ' following the rg flow equations of the form @xmath32 the functions in the right hand sides of the rg flow equations , in general , should depend both on @xmath33 and @xmath34 , besides the explicit @xmath0 dependence .",
    "we suppress the @xmath34 dependence for simplicity that should suffice for our present analysis of the rayleigh and vdp equations @xmath35c.f . equations @xmath36",
    ", @xmath37 .",
    "the flow equations are derived from the consistency condition that the actual renormalized solution @xmath38 should be independent of the arbitrary initial adjustment @xmath25 : @xmath39 .",
    "the final form of the uniformly valid rg solution @xmath40 is obtained by setting @xmath41 that eliminates the secular terms .",
    "let us remark here that the actual convergence of the rg expansions is not well addressed and should require further investigations",
    ". moreover , estimation of asymptotic amplitude for a limit cycle as @xmath42 , for instance , from the perturbation expansion of @xmath43 is expected to fail for @xmath44 .    in the framework of nonlinear time ,",
    "we suppose the arbitrary initial time @xmath25 to depend explicitly on the nonlinearity parameter ( coupling strength ) @xmath0 of the nonlinear equation , so that one can write @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a slowly varying ( almost constant ) , free ( asymptotic ) control parameter for @xmath42 and @xmath47 either to 0 or @xmath48 , to be utilized judiciously to improve the convergence and non - perturbative global asymptotic behaviour of the original rg proposal ( @xmath49 for @xmath50 ) . in appendix , we give an overview , in brief , of an extended analytic framework that naturally supports nontrivial existence of such an asymptotic scaling parameter @xmath51 as a function of the rescaled @xmath52 variable @xmath53 , satisfying what we call the _ principle of duality structure_. the secular terms in the naive perturbation series would now be altered instead as @xmath54 and we obtain the new rg flow equations in the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are nonzero , minimal order @xmath33 dependent terms in the respective perturbation series . following the analogy of rg prescription in annulling secular divergence through corresponding ` flowing ' of the renormalized perturbative amplitude and phase",
    ", we next make _ the key assumption that there exists , for a given nonlinear oscillation , a set of right control parameters @xmath58 that would absorb any possible secular or other kind of divergence in the higher order perturbation series _ , ( see appendix for justification ) , so that in the asymptotic limit @xmath59 , one obtains the finite , non - perturbative flow equations directly for the periodic orbit of the nonlinear system @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 is a finite _ scale _ independent control parameter in the rescaled variable @xmath63 @xmath52 and @xmath64 is the @xmath0- dependent amplitude of the limit cycle .",
    "a simple quadrature formula should then relate the control parameter @xmath65 with the amplitude @xmath1 . as a consequence , adjusting the control parameter @xmath66 suitably , one can generate an efficient algorithm to estimate the amplitude @xmath1 that would compare well with the exact values , upto any desired accuracy .",
    "it will transpire that the control parameter @xmath67 must respect some asymptotic conditions depending on the characteristic features of a particular relaxation oscillation @xmath35c.f .",
    "section [ sec m - rg sol description]@xmath68 .",
    "exploiting the rescaling symmetry , one may as well rewrite the above non - perturbative flow equations ( [ rgflownp ] ) in the equivalent @xmath69-dependent scaling variable @xmath70 , @xmath71 , for each fixed value of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath0 that should expose small scale @xmath69-dependent variation of the amplitude . as a biproduct that would allow one to retrieve an efficient approximation of the limit cycle orbit for the nonlinear oscillator .",
    "it turns out that the general framework of irgm is quite successful in obtaining excellent fits for the limit cycle orbit even for relaxation oscillation corresponding to nonlinearity parameters @xmath72 .",
    "it follows that the application of the of idea of nonlinear time in rg formalism offers one with a robust formalism for global asymptotic analysis for a general nonlinear system that might even be advantageous in many respects compared to ham .",
    "the application of nonlinear time in ham will be considered separately .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec ham sol ]",
    "we have deduced the solution to the equation @xmath5 by ham . in section [ sec rg sol ]",
    "we compute the classical rg solution upto @xmath73 order and compare estimated values of the limit cycle amplitude with the exact values .",
    "the improved rg method is presented in section [ sec m - rg sol description ] .",
    "this introduces a control parameter @xmath66 in the rg analysis . in subsection",
    "[ subsec amplitude estimation ] approximate analytic formulae are deduced for the amplitudes of the limit cycles of the rayleigh and the vdp equations .",
    "efficient match with the exact values can be obtained by appropriate choice of @xmath66 . in subsection 4.2",
    "we present the efficient of approximate limit cycle orbits for the rayleigh and vdp oscillators for @xmath74 .",
    "we close our discussions in sec .",
    "5 . in appendix 1",
    ", we present a brief outline of the formal structure of the analytic formalism presented here . in appendix 2 ,",
    "an alternative approach in the derivation of non - perturbative flow equations is presented .",
    "the homotopy analysis method proposed by liao @xcite is used to obtain the solution of non - linear equation even if the problem does not contain a small or large parameter .",
    "ham always gives a family of functions at any given order of approximation .",
    "an auxiliary parameter @xmath16 is introduced in ham to control the convergence region of approximating series involved in this method to the exact solution .",
    "ham is based on the idea of homotopy in topology . in simple language , it involves continuous deformation of the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) to that of desired nonlinear ode .",
    "the solution of linear ode gives a set of functions called _ base functions_. one advantage of ham is that it can be used to approximate a nonlinear problem by efficient choice of different sets of base functions .",
    "a suitable choice of the set of base functions and the convergence control parameter can speed up the convergence process .",
    "in this paper we consider the self - excited system @xmath75 , which can be written as the ode@xmath76 where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the time @xmath4 .",
    "a limit cycle represents an isolated periodic motion of a self - excited system .",
    "this is an isolated closed curve @xmath77 @xmath78 in the phase plane so that any path in its suitable small neighbourhood starting from a point , specified by some given initial condition , ultimately converges to @xmath35or diverge from@xmath68 @xmath77 .",
    "consequently , this periodic motion represented by limit cycle is independent of initial conditions .",
    "it , however , involves the frequency @xmath79 and the amplitude @xmath80 of the oscillation .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we consider an initial condition@xmath81    in @xcite , an alternative initial condition i.e. @xmath82 was considered .",
    "let , with slight abuse of notations , @xmath83 so that @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively become@xmath86 and@xmath87 since the limit cycle represents a periodic motion , so we suppose that the initial approximation to the solution @xmath88 to @xmath89 can be taken as@xmath90 let , @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively denote the initial approximations of the frequency @xmath79 and the amplitude @xmath80 .",
