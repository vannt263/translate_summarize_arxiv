    "in 1986 , the first experimental realisation of a quasi - one - dimensional electron system ( q1des ) in a dynamically confined two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) was achieved  @xcite . since",
    "then there has been an extensive theoretical and experimental effort into understanding their basic properties ( see , e.g. , review  @xcite and book  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the interest in these systems stems from two facts .",
    "first , the effective transverse size of a q1des can be easily controlled and made remarkably small , down to the de broglie wavelength of an electron .",
    "this makes it possible to realise experimental systems which have an arbitrary number of occupied transverse modes .",
    "second , the high purity of 2degs grown by molecular beam epitaxy enables the almost collisionless motion of an electron through an experimental q1des .",
    "the coexistence of these two factors has made q1des unique objects for the investigation of transport phenomena yielding , in particular , the observation of the ballistic quantisation of conductance  @xcite and the so called 0.7 conductance structure  @xcite .",
    "the process of electron transmission through a q1des involves the redistribution of incoming electron flux among its discrete eigenstates followed by adiabatic transport through them .",
    "therefore the determination of the electron eigenstates of a q1des is an integral and very important part of the more general quantum transport problem .",
    "this statement is especially relevant to the ballistic transport regime where the _ total _ conductance of a system is _ completely defined _ by the number of propagating electron modes which in turn can be uniquely calculated from the energy spectrum and the fermi energy  @xcite .    clearly , the energy spectrum of electrons crucially depends on the effective geometry of a q1des as well as on external and internal fields acting on them . among the possible internal forces ,",
    "one of the least understood examples is the interaction between orbital and spin degrees of freedom of an electron : the _ spin - orbit interaction _ , also referred to as the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "although this interaction has an essentially relativistic nature ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it nevertheless can give rise to an observable modification of semiconductor band structure @xcite .    a quite general theoretical approach to the description of the so interaction is to use the following hamiltonian  @xcite which stems directly from the quadratic in @xmath0 expansion of the dirac equation :    @xmath1    here @xmath2 is the free electron mass , @xmath3 is the momentum operator , @xmath4 is the elementary charge , @xmath5 is the vector of the pauli matrices , @xmath6 is the potential energy of the particle , and @xmath7 stands for the spatial gradient .",
    "the convenience ( or universality ) of the hamiltonian ( [ h_so ] ) is that it does not restrict one to any particular form ( model ) of the potential @xmath6 , but allows freedom of choice depending on the nature and the symmetry of forces present in a given medium .",
    "its form is such that it can remove the spin degeneracy in electron band structure whilst not actually producing an overall spin polarization .    in a bulk ( 3d ) crystalline environment ,",
    "the energy @xmath6 arises exclusively from the periodic ( microscopic ) crystal potential .",
    "most multicomponent semiconductors have either zincblende ( gaas and most iii - v compounds ) or wurtzite ( ii - vi compounds ) lattice structure , both of which lack inversion symmetry .",
    "dresselhaus  @xcite has shown that this property eventually leads to a so - induced splitting of the conduction band into two subbands .",
    "the magnitude of the splitting is proportional to the cube of the electron wave number @xmath8 .    in mosfets and heterostructures the host crystals can not be treated as ideal 3d systems , because the crystal symmetry is broken at the device interface where 2d electron or hole gases are dynamically confined in a quantum well .",
    "the reduction of the effective dimensionality lowers the symmetry of the underlying crystals and results in an additional ( linear in @xmath8 ) term in the dresselhaus splitting . moreover , if the quantum well is sufficiently narrow , then the linear contribution is dominant  @xcite and , e.g. , may reach @xmath9 ",
    "@xmath10 mev in 180- - thick modulation - doped gaas wells  @xcite .",
    "theoretical arguments  @xcite suggest that this can also be true in strained iii - v crystals and hexagonal ii - vi compounds .    along with the _ microscopic _ crystal forces",
    ", there is another source of the potential energy @xmath6 in 2d systems .",
    "it is caused by the interface electric field that accompanies the quantum - well asymmetry  @xcite and is directed along the normal to the device plane . since the typical well width is @xmath11 ",
    "@xmath12 nm , the interface potential turns out to be slowly varying on the scale of the lattice parameter and can be considered _",
    "macroscopic _ , as opposed to the rapidly oscillating atomic field .",
    "the mechanism of the so interaction originating from the interface field was first introduced by rashba in ref .",
    "it also manifests itself as a linear in @xmath8 splitting  @xcite of the 2d bandstructure . in a variety of systems including si - mosfets  @xcite , inas /",
    "gasb  @xcite and alsb / inas / alsb  @xcite quantum wells , ingaas / inalas heterostructures  @xcite , gaas electron gases  @xcite it can be made to dominate the dresselhaus terms indicating the significance of macroscopic potentials in producing observable so effects in low - dimensional systems .    in modern nanotechnology there exists a number of methods for creating q1des from 2degs : the split - gate technique ; wet and dry etching ; and cleaved edge overgrowth  @xcite .",
    "in essence , they all exploit the confinement of the lateral ( in - plane ) motion of electrons ( holes ) by some transverse potential",
    ". any such potential must be essentially non - uniform in space in order to force the charged particles to remain within a confined area .",
    "the spatial variation scale of the confining potential crucially depends on the particular fabrication method and varies over a wide range : @xmath13  @xmath14 nm .",
    "thus , in q1des one finds another example of macroscopic potentials , viz the lateral confining potential , which is absent in higher - dimensional structures .",
    "the spatial non - uniformity of the confining potential gives rise to an additional ( in - plane ) electric field in the system .",
    "if the confinement is sufficiently strong ( narrow and deep ) , then this field may not be negligible in comparison with the interface - induced ( rashba ) field .",
    "moreover , in nearly square ( i.e. symmetric ) quantum wells where the rashba field is essentially suppressed  @xcite , the in - plane ( `` confining '' ) electric field is likely to be dominant .",
    "this suggests the possible importance of the lateral confining potential to the so hamiltonian ( [ h_so ] ) in q1des .",
    "we are not aware of any experimental evidence or measurement of the strength of the so coupling resulting from such a confining potential and can not therefore quote a grounded estimate for the corresponding energy modification .",
    "nevertheless , the above arguments seem sufficiently strong to indicate a possible new mechanism for the so interaction in q1des and point towards new transport effects .",
    "the existence of an additional ( and easily controllable ) source of the so coupling could catalyse experiments on quantum - wire based devices that exploit both the charge and spin of an electron , e.g. spin transistors  @xcite and active spin polarisers  @xcite .",
    "our belief in the importance of the so interaction in semiconductor q1des is strongly supported by the fact that observable manifestations of a so - induced energy splitting have already been found experimentally  @xcite in another type of q1des , viz in electron gases trapped by dislocational defects in silicon crystals .",
    "the source of the so coupling in these systems is an electric field perpendicular to dislocations and the so - related energy splitting is linear in the wave number @xmath8 , which makes a physical analogy between the electron gas on dislocations and semiconductor q1des quite close .",
    "the so interaction manifests itself in spin - dependent electron conductivity along dislocations which can be ascribed to combined spin resonance  @xcite of electrons corresponding to transitions between so - split energy levels .    in this paper",
    "we analyse theoretically the effect of the spin - orbit interaction on the energy spectrum and conductance of a long q1des . as a model for the q1des",
    ", we use a strictly 2d electron gas subject to a transverse electrostatic confining potential . to decide on a reasonable shape of the confining potential , we assume a sufficiently small effective width ( @xmath15 nm ) for the q1des and a low electron concentration ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) . combined together , these two factors prevent the confining electric field from being significantly screened by the electron gas . under these conditions",
    "the confining potential can be accurately approximated by a parabolic potential  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is very favourable to our problem because exact analytical expressions for the energy spectrum and wave functions of a 2d electron gas in a parabolic potential are well known and provide us with a good zero approximation in dealing with the so coupling .",
    "we include the so interaction via the hamiltonian ( [ h_so ] ) .",
    "we assume that the potential @xmath6 which is responsible for the so coupling consists of two contributions : ( i ) a parabolic confining potential with a gradient ( or the accompanying electric field ) which lies in the plane of the 2deg ; ( ii ) a potential which arises from the asymmetry of the quantum well with the corresponding electric field ( rashba field ) being uniform and directed perpendicular to the device plane .",
    "we neglect the crystal - field ( dresselhaus ) contribution to @xmath6 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to reveal the qualitative hallmarks of the so interaction in q1des rather than to construct a complete and realistic spectral and transport theory .",
    "therefore we use two major simplifications .",
    "first , we neglect the coulomb interaction between electrons . at first sight",
    "one may not expect this approximation to work in low - concentration 2d electron systems where the coulomb energy may exceed the kinetic energy by an order of magnitude .",
    "however , it has recently been shown theoretically  @xcite that the effect of electron - electron interactions on so coupling in such systems can be plausibly taken into account via a renormalisation of the so coupling constant .",
    "more specifically , this renormalisation leads to an enhancement ( by @xmath12 ",
    "@xmath18 % ) of the strength of the so interaction , which emphasises the significance of the so - related effects in low - dimensional electron systems .",
    "our second simplification is the exploitation of one - band effective mass approximation  @xcite for the schrdinger equation . within this approximation ,",
    "the influence of the crystal forces on electron dynamics in the conduction band is reduced to the renormalisation of the electron mass and all interband transitions are left out . despite the obvious simplicity ,",
    "this approach works well  @xcite for a wide range of semiconductor materials .",
    "section  [ sec - theory ] is the central part of the paper .",
    "it is devoted to the solution of the problem that we have outlined above and to the analysis of the results obtained . in subsection  [ subsec-2a ]",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian of a 2deg that includes the parabolic confining potential and the so - interaction term ( [ h_so ] ) . we take into account only those contributions to the so hamiltonian that arise from macroscopic ( i.e. relatively smooth ) potentials , viz from the quantum - well ( rashba ) and the parabolic confining potentials .",
    "since the operator ( [ h_so ] ) contains the pauli matrices , we seek electron wave functions in the form of two - component spinors .",
    "within such a representation the schrdinger equation turns out to be a system of two _ coupled _ differential equations with respect to the spinor components . in next two subsections",
    "we solve this system for two physically different situations .",
    "subsection  [ subsec-2b ] deals with the case of zero rashba so coupling , where the entire so interaction comes from the parabolic confining potential .",
    "here the schrdinger equations decouple and the electron wave functions and energy spectrum are found in an explicitly analytical form . in subsection  [ subsec-2c ] we consider a more general situation where both mechanisms of the so - coupling are present . in this case",
    "we calculate the electron wave functions and energy spectrum numerically using the results of subsection  [ subsec-2b ] as a convenient basis .",
    "afterwards we analyse the energy spectrum obtained in order to reveal the basic features of both so - coupling mechanisms . in subsection  [ subsec-2d ]",
    "we discuss possible manifestations of the so interaction in the dependence of the ballistic conductance of a q1des on the fermi energy .",
    "section  [ sec - con ] summarises the results of our research .",
    "within one - band effective mass approximation  @xcite the hamiltonian of a q1des can be written as    @xmath19    where @xmath20 is a 2d position vector and @xmath21 is the effective electron mass . in line with the refs .",
    "@xcite , the _ lateral confining potential _",
    "@xmath22 is approximated by a parabola    @xmath23    the quantity @xmath24 controls the strength ( curvature ) of the confining potential .",
    "the in - plane electric field @xmath25 associated with @xmath22 is given by @xmath26 .",
    "we assume that the so interaction hamiltonian @xmath27 ( [ h_so ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) is formed by two contributions : @xmath28 .",
    "the first one , @xmath29 , arises from the asymmetry of the quantum well , i.e. from the rashba mechanism  @xcite of the so coupling . since the interface - induced ( rashba )",
    "electric field can reasonably be assumed uniform and directed along the @xmath30-axis , the term @xmath29 can be described by the following expression :    @xmath31    the so - coupling constant @xmath32 takes values within a range ( @xmath33  @xmath12)@xmath34 ev@xmath35 cm for different systems  @xcite . for brevity , in what follows we will refer to the rashba mechanism of the so coupling as @xmath32-coupling .",
    "the second contribution @xmath36 to @xmath37 comes from the parabolic confining potential ( [ v_sg ] ) :    @xmath38    here @xmath39 is the typical spatial scale associated with the potential @xmath40 ( [ v_sg ] ) . in eq .",
    "( [ h_b ] ) we have introduced the so - coupling constant @xmath41 .",
    "comparison of typical electric fields originated from the quantum - well and lateral confining potentials allows one to conclude that a plausible estimate for @xmath41 should be roughly @xmath12% of @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , in square quantum wells where the value of @xmath32 is considerably diminished  @xcite ( by an order of magnitude ) the constant @xmath41 may well compete with @xmath32 .",
    "henceforth we adopt the term @xmath41-coupling for the mechanism of the so - interaction arising from the lateral confining potential ( [ v_sg ] ) .",

    "the equations ( [ plus ] ) and ( [ minus ] ) are arranged in such a way that all the terms which couple them together are collected on the rhs. it is interesting that this arrangement separates explicitly the @xmath32 and @xmath41 mechanisms of the so interaction .",
    "indeed , the @xmath32-terms enter only the rhs , while all the @xmath41-terms are contained on the lhs. this suggests that the @xmath41-coupling is responsible for forming independent ( `` unperturbed '' or `` non - interacting '' ) wave functions @xmath49 , while the @xmath32-coupling mixes them together to form the solution of the whole system ( [ plus ] ) and ( [ minus ] ) .",

    "there is another effect of the enhanced energy anticrossing on the conductance that is not seen in figs .",

    "@xcite showed analytically that the degradation of quantised conductance decreases exponentially with the ratio of the 1d subband spacings to the standard deviation of impurity potential fluctuations .",

    "[ fig3](a ) ] with the standard linear dependence  @xcite @xmath276 being observed for relatively small and large values of @xmath8 only .",

    "the suppression of the rashba energy splitting is a part of the overall effect of the @xmath41-coupling on the underlying electron system which consists of a considerable enhancement of the hybridisation between different quantum states and eventually leads to a more pronounced anticrossing of neighbouring energy branches .",
    "in addition to the investigation of the so - effects in the energy spectrum of electrons , we have discussed the possible manifestations of the so interaction in the ballistic conductance of a q1des .",
    "the key point of our approach to the conductance is the fundamental _ current - conservation identity _ that was proven in subsection  [ subsec-2d ] . according to this identity",
    ", the electron eigenstates that were found as the solution to the spectral problem are _ perfect _ current - carrying states .",
    "a current can travel in any of these states without scattering into any other .",
    "this property therefore allows the ballistic conductance to be calculated directly from the energy spectrum with the help of simple landauer formula ( [ g ] ) .",
    "an analysis of the ballistic conductance @xmath202 reveals that the @xmath41-coupling alone does _ not _ affect the dependence of @xmath202 on the fermi energy @xmath203 .",
    "this fact is illustrated by fig .  [ fig5](a ) where we see that the @xmath41-coupling reduces the curvature of the parabolic energy bands ( cf . dotted and solid curves ) , while the band edges ( bottoms of the parabolas ) remain anchored .",
    "thus , @xmath41-coupling can not be detected by measuring the ballistic conductance in systems where the so interaction appears _ only _ in a form of the @xmath41-coupling ( e.g. in square wells ) .",
    "instead , one should use experimental methods that allow direct observation of the electron energy spectrum in a q1des , e.g. magnetotunneling measurements  @xcite .    in the presence of @xmath32-coupling the behaviour of @xmath232",
    "is essentially determined by the strength of the so interaction .",
    "if the @xmath32-coupling is not too strong ( @xmath256 ) , then its only effect on the conductance will be shifts of the conductance quantisation steps to lower fermi energies in comparison with an ideal ( i.e. with zero so interaction ) situation .",
    "we note that such shifts are not related to the lateral confining potential and should also be present in purely 2d systems .",
    "this effect should be detectable in transconductance measurements ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which determine both the conductance and the subband spacings simultaneously .    in the limit of strong @xmath32-coupling ( @xmath248 )",
    "the electron energy bands take on a very interesting form [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) ] .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the appearance of narrow energy intervals where two additional ( forward and backward propagating ) electron modes exist [ fig .",
    "[ fig5](d ) ] .",
    "such intervals can be found in each 1d subband , starting from the lowest one .",
    "the additional electron modes have similar magnitude group velocities but propagate in opposite directions .",
    "they have almost identical subband wave functions and therefore would be susceptible to strong intermode scattering in the presence of disorder .",
    "however , in a sufficiently pure q1des , the additional electron modes give rise to the unusual periodic sharp steps in @xmath232 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) .",
    "this picture is changed by switching on relatively weak ( @xmath283 ) @xmath41-coupling . as we mentioned above in the discussion of the energy spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath41-coupling enhances the anticrossing of energy levels initiated by the @xmath32-coupling .",
    "as applied to the conductance , this effect leads to _ quenching _ the sharp conductance peaks by the @xmath41-coupling .",
    "the existence of the single peak ( or just a few of peaks ) in the dependence of @xmath202 on @xmath203 could be a clear experimental indication of the presence of the @xmath41-coupling in the system .",
    "the most crucial point for the experimental observation of the conductance peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is to make the ratio @xmath59 sufficiently large ( @xmath284 ) . in typical systems ,",
    "where enhancing the so interaction is not paid special attention , the value of @xmath59 hardly exceeds @xmath285 .",
    "an additional , at least threefold , increase in @xmath59 could be achieved by using : ( i ) materials with light carrier masses ; ( ii ) strong ( narrow ) lateral potential confinement @xmath286 nm ; ( iii ) heterojunctions ( triangular well ) rather than quantum - well heterostructures ( square well ) ; ( iv ) a back gate voltage to maximise the interface ( rashba ) electric field .",
    "we hope that the results presented in this paper will stimulate further experimental and theoretical work with the aim of understanding the role of the spin - orbit interaction in determining the transport properties of quasi-1d systems .",
