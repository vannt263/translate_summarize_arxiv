    "the quantum dynamics of an oscillator with time dependent modulation of its frequency has been investigated very extensively @xcite .",
    "this is because of its many applications in different contexts .",
    "one very interesting application was in the context of center of mass motion of an ion in paul trap .",
    "more recently the study of modulated oscillator acquired new importance in connection with bec s where trap potential can easily be manipulated @xcite .",
    "further nanomechanical oscillators provided new impetus for the study of quantum dynamics of frequency modulated system @xcite .",
    "one of the important outcome of such studies was that mechanical and vibrational degrees of freedom can be prepared in nonclassical states @xcite .",
    "in particular , one found that sudden changes in the frequency of the oscillator yield significant amount of squeezing .",
    "in all the above studies the oscillator was treated as a quantum system whereas the source of modulation was considered as something prescribed .",
    "clearly a complete quantum dynamical theory should consider the source also to be quantized system .",
    "this is important as the mechanical oscillator can have significant back action on the source of modulation .",
    "the system is then a quantum optical spring , i.e. , a spring whose spring constant depends on the quantum state of another system .",
    "the modulation by a quantized source produces new features in the quantum dynamics as the oscillator samples the discrete structure of the quantized source of modulation .",
    "in particular we show the appearance of characteristic quantum revivals and fractional revivals @xcite .",
    "the dynamics we present should be realized by the effects of radiation pressure on micromirror @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we describe the model and derive analytical result for the reduced density matrix of the oscillator and the source of modulation .",
    "the quantum dynamics of the oscillator is discussed in section iii . in section iv , we analyze the squeezing properties . the back action effect is described in section v.",
    "consider a harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 .",

    "let us assume that the frequency of the oscillator is modulated by a quantized source such that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) goes to    @xmath6    since the interaction part commutes with the unperturbed hamiltonian of the quantized source we do not write this part of the energy . further for brevity",
    "we would denote by qsm as the quantized source of modulation .",

    "it is a nonfactorized state and thus the spring gets entangled to the quantum system controlling the spring constant .",
    "the reduced state of the oscillator and qsm can be obtained by projecting out the degrees of freedom of the other system .",
    "it is seen that the density matrix for the oscillator is    @xmath24{\\langle\\psi_l^{p}|\\phi_{n}\\rangle}{\\langle\\phi_m|\\psi_j^{p}\\rangle}~,\\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and that for qsm is    @xmath25    @xmath26~.\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note specially the rather involved form of the reduced density matrix for the qsm .",
    "this is because the scalar product of the wave functions @xmath27 for different @xmath4 is nonzero-    @xmath28    using eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) we can study the details of the quantum dynamics of the oscillator coupled to qsm .",
    "we would like to mention that the quantum characteristics of a nanomechanical oscillator coupled to a quantized photon source has been studied by several authors @xcite who have shown how nonclassical states like cat states of such a system can be generated .",
    "the hamiltonian used by previous authors is given by @xmath29 which is linear in the oscillator variable and is different from @xmath30 which is produced by modulation .",
