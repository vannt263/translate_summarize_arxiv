    "the so - called non - messing - up theorem is a well known sorting result for rectangular arrays . in @xcite , donald e.",
    "knuth attributes the result to hermann boerner , who mentions it in a footnote in chapter v ,  5 of @xcite .",
    "later , david gale and richard m.  karp include the phenomenon in @xcite and in @xcite , where they prove more general results about order preservation in sorting procedures .",
    "the first use of the term `` non - messing - up '' seems to be due to gale and karp , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "one statement of the result is as follows .",
    "[ nmu ] let @xmath0 be an @xmath1-by-@xmath2 array of real numbers",
    ". put each row of @xmath3 into non - decreasing order .",
    "that is , for each @xmath4 , place the values @xmath5 in non - decreasing order ( henceforth denoted _ row - sort _ ) .",
    "this yields the array @xmath6 .",
    "column - sort @xmath7 .",
    "each row in the resulting array is in non - decreasing order .",
    "following the solution submitted by j.  l.  pietenpol in @xcite , first row - sort @xmath3 to obtain @xmath7 .",
    "column - sort @xmath7 by first permuting the rows to order the first column ; to order the second column , permute the rows without their first entries ; and so on .",
    "the rows remain sorted at each step of the procedure .    applying the theorem to the transpose of the array @xmath3 , the sorting",
    "can also be done first in the columns , then in the rows , and the columns remain sorted .",
    "@xmath8    answering a question posed by richard p.  stanley , the author s thesis advisor , this paper defines a notion of non - messing - up for posets and theorem  [ answer ] generalizes theorem  [ nmu ] by characterizing all posets with this property .",
    "standard terminology from the theory of partially ordered sets will be used throughout the paper . a good reference for these terms and other information about posets",
    "is chapter 3 of @xcite .    the rectangular array in theorem  [ nmu ] can be viewed as the poset @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 denotes a @xmath11-element chain ) .",
    "the _ rows _ and _ columns _ are two different sets of disjoint saturated chains , each covering this poset . sorting a chain orders the chain s labels so that the minimum element in the chain has the minimum label .",
    "thus , sorting the labels @xmath12 in this manner gives a linear extension of @xmath9 .",
    "an _ edge _ in a poset @xmath13 is a covering relation @xmath14 .",
    "two elements in @xmath13 are _ adjacent _ if there is an edge between them .",

    "the map @xmath24 will denote the labels of elements of a poset @xmath13 .",
    "the main result of this paper is the classification of @xmath22 .",
    "it is illustrative to clarify the difference between this result and gale and karp s work in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "gale and karp consider a poset @xmath13 and a partition @xmath25 of the elements of @xmath13 .",
    "the elements in each block of @xmath25 are linearly ordered , not necessarily in relation to comparability in @xmath13 . given @xmath13 and @xmath25 , the authors determine whether each natural labeling of @xmath13 , sorted within each block of @xmath25 , yields a labeling that is still natural .",
    "this paper does not require that the original labeling be natural .",
    "in fact , it is the labelings that are not natural and that do not become natural after the first sort that determine membership in @xmath22",
    ". additionally , the partition blocks in @xmath22 are saturated chains , and every covering relation must be in at least one of these chains .",
    "the goal of this paper is to determine , for a given poset , when there _ exist _ chain covers with the non - messing - up property , not if a given pair of chain covers has the property .",
    "it is important to emphasize that @xmath26 is an unordered pair and that there is a symmetry between the chain covers .",
    "the elements of @xmath20 and their edges will be referred to as _ red _ , and the elements of @xmath21 and their edges as _",
    "blue_. if an edge belongs to both chain covers , it is _",
    "doubly colored_. the symmetry between the chain covers may be expressed by a statement about red and blue chains and an indication that a _ color reversed _ version of the statement is also true .",
    "central to the classification of @xmath22 is the following object , defined and denoted @xmath27 in @xcite .",

    "the final section of the paper discusses further directions for the study of non - messing - up posets , including several open questions .",
    "the definition of a non - messing - up poset requires that every edge be colored . therefore , as in the case of the product of two chains , @xmath16-sorting any labeling of a poset @xmath13 and then @xmath17-sorting yields a linear extension of @xmath13 if the labels are @xmath35 .",
    "the chains of @xmath16 are disjoint , so each element of a non - messing - up poset is covered by at most two elements , and covers at most two elements .",

    "a poset of the form depicted in figure  [ typeiistrings](a ) , that is , a poset consisting of a single diamond and its bottom and top chains , can also be colored so that the diamond has type i if the bounds of lemma  [ typeirules ] are satisfied .",
    "otherwise , the only freedom in defining the chain covers arises from the various ways to reduce @xmath13 due to splits as depicted in figure  [ splits](a ) .",

    "these chain covers have the non - messing - up property , but there is a certain redundancy : this particular @xmath16 chain adds no information about the relations in the poset since its labels are already ordered after the @xmath17-sort .",
    "because the coloring of a non - messing - up poset is induced by its reduced poset , the elements of @xmath178 can be determined by looking at these reduced posets .",

    "[ nanswer ] the collection @xmath178 is the set of posets in @xmath22 where every maximal branch chain in the reduced poset @xmath119 consists of exactly two elements , and every element of @xmath119 is adjacent to at least two other elements in @xmath119 .    if an element of @xmath178 consists of a single diamond and its top and bottom chains , then that diamond must have type i. similarly , there are no posets whose hasse diagrams are trees , as in figure  [ treeanswer](a ) , as every reduced tree has an element with at most one incident edge .",

    "this is a convex subposet of a cylinder poset , where the splits are of the smallest size .",
    "when elements are split , the new edges must be doubly colored by lemma  [ chains ] .",
