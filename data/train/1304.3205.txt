    "with finite neutrino masses included , the standard model allows for lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "yet the smallness of these masses leads to a very large suppression , with predicted branching fractions well beyond current experimental sensitivity .",
    "however , there are various theoretical models which may enhance lfv effects up to a detectable level . examples of such model predictions , which often involve super - symmetry ( susy ) , include susy - based grand unified theories @xcite , susy with a right - handed neutrino @xcite , gauge - mediated susy breaking @xcite , susy with vector - like leptons @xcite , susy with r - parity violation @xcite , models with a z@xmath3 @xcite , and models violating lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "the detection of a lfv decay well above standard model expectations would be distinctive evidence for new physics .",
    "experimentally , the search for lfv effects has been carried out using lepton ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) decays , pseudoscalar meson ( k,@xmath6 ) decays , and vector meson ( @xmath7,@xmath0,@xmath8 ) decays , etc .",
    "for example , a recent search for the decay of @xmath9 from the meg collaboration yields an upper limit of @xmath10 @xcite , and in a similar search with @xmath5 decays the babar collaboration reports @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the latest results for neutral kaon and pion decays from the e871 collaboration and the e865 collaboration , respectively , are @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the best @xmath7 decay limit , based on 8.5 pb@xmath14 of @xmath15 annihilations at center - of - mass energies from @xmath16 mev , is obtained by the snd collaboration : @xmath17 @xcite . in the bottomonium system , based on about 20.8 million @xmath18 events , 9.3 million @xmath19 events , and 5.9 million @xmath20 events , the cleoiii collaboration presented the most stringent lfv upper limits , @xmath21 @xcite . for charmonium ,",
    "the best limits come from the besii collaboration , who obtained @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite from a sample of 58 million @xmath0 events .",
    "a recent sample of 225 million @xmath0 events @xcite collected with the much improved besiii detector now allows for lfv searches in @xmath0 decays with a significant improvement in sensitivity .",
    "we present here our results from a blind analysis of @xmath25 .",
    "the besiii detector @xcite at the bepcii collider is a large solid - angle magnetic spectrometer with a geometrical acceptance of 93% of @xmath26 solid angle consisting of four main components .",
    "the innermost is a small - cell , helium - based ( 40% he , 60% c@xmath27h@xmath28 ) main drift chamber ( mdc ) with 43 layers providing an average single - hit resolution of 135 @xmath4 m .",
    "the resulting charged - particle momentum resolution in our 1.0 t magnetic field is 0.5% at 1.0 gev , and the resolution on the ionization energy loss information ( @xmath29 ) is better than 6% .",
    "next is a time - of - flight ( tof ) system constructed of 5 cm thick plastic scintillators , with 176 detectors of 2.4 m length in two layers in the barrel and 96 fan - shaped detectors in the end - caps .",
    "the barrel ( end - cap ) time resolution of 80 ps ( 110 ps ) provides a @xmath30 @xmath31 separation for momenta up to 1.0 gev .",
    "continuing outward , we have an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) consisting of 6240 csi(tl ) crystals in a cylindrical barrel structure and two end - caps .",
    "the energy resolution at 1.0 gev is 2.5% ( 5% ) and the position resolution is 6 mm ( 9 mm ) in the barrel ( end - caps ) .",
    "finally , the muon counter ( muc ) consisting of 1000 m@xmath32 of resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) in nine barrel and eight end - cap layers ; it provides a 2 cm position resolution .",
    "our event selection and sensitivity , including backgrounds , are optimized through monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .",
    "the geant4-based simulation software boost @xcite incorporates the geometry implementation simulations and material composition of the besiii detector , the detector response and digitization models as well as the tracking of the detector running conditions and performances .",
    "the generic simulated events are generated by @xmath15 annihilation into a @xmath0 meson using the generator kkmc @xcite at energies around the center - of - mass energy @xmath33 gev .",
    "the beam energy and its energy spread are set according to measurements of bepcii , and initial state radiation ( isr ) is implemented in the @xmath0 generation .",
    "the decays of the @xmath0 resonance are generated by evtgen @xcite for the known modes with branching fractions according to the world - average values @xcite , and by lundcharm @xcite for the remaining unknown decay modes .",
    "we search for events in which @xmath0 decays into an electron and a muon .",
    "candidate signal events are required to have two well - measured tracks with @xmath34 and zero net charge , consistent with originating from the interaction point . here , @xmath35 is the polar angle with respect to the beam axis and the closest approach of each track to the interaction point must be less then @xmath36 cm ( @xmath37 cm ) in the beam direction ( in the plane perpendicular to the beam ) . to reject cosmic rays ,",
    "the tof difference between the charged tracks must be less than 1.0 ns .",
    "the acollinearity and acoplanarity angles between two charged tracks are required to be less than @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , to reduce other backgrounds .    in order to suppress the radiative events from @xmath40 and @xmath41",
    ", we veto events with one or more good photon candidates passing the following requirements .",
    "candidate showers reconstructed in both the emc barrel region ( @xmath34 ) and in the end - caps ( @xmath42 ) must have a minimum energy of 15 mev .",
    "showers in the angular range between the barrel and end - cap are poorly reconstructed and are not considered .",
    "showers caused by charged particles are eliminated by requiring candidates to be more than 20 degrees away from the extrapolated positions of all charged tracks .",
    "requirements on emc cluster timing suppress both electronic noise and energy deposits unrelated to the event .",
    "the above selection criteria retain events with back - to - back charged tracks and no obvious extra emc activity .",
    "most of the remaining events originate from the background processes @xmath43 and @xmath44 , in order to suppress the these background events , we identify electrons and muons based on the information of the mdc , emc and muc sub - detectors . the requirements are determined using electron , muon , pion and kaon samples from @xmath45 mc events .",
    "electron identification requires no associated hits in the muc and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the energy deposited in the emc and @xmath48 is the momentum measured by the mdc .",

    "[ fig7 ] shows the @xmath50 and @xmath49 distributions for electrons , which are well - separated from other particles .",
    "muon identification uses the barrel muc system which covers @xmath51 .",
    "charged tracks are required to have @xmath52 and a deposited energy in the emc @xmath53 gev .",
    "we require the penetration depth in the muc to be larger than 40 cm ; if the track penetrates more than three detecting layers in the muc , we also require the muc track fit to have @xmath54 .",
    "finally , the @xmath49 value from the @xmath29 measurement calculated with the electron hypothesis must be less than @xmath55 .",
    "the simulated distributions of the deposited energy in the emc and the penetration depth in the muc are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "our final analysis of event yields for @xmath56 is performed with the two variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the magnitude of the vector sum of the momentum in the event , @xmath60 is the total reconstructed energy ( calculated using @xmath61 with each track momentum @xmath48 ) , and @xmath62 is the center - of - mass energy .",
    "our signal region is defined by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which correspond in each case to about two standard deviations as determined by mc simulation .",
    "the analysis is done in a blind fashion in order not to bias our choice of selection criteria . before examining the signal region , all selection criteria were optimized based on simulated samples with a sensitivity figure - of - merit ( fom ) defined as the average upper limit from an ensemble of experiments with the expected background and no signal , @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the detection efficiency determined with a sample of 100,000 simulated @xmath67 events , @xmath68 is the expected number of background events based on background process simulations , @xmath69 is the number of observed candidate events",
