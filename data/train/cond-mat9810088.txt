    "<S> the critical behaviour of the fully frustrated xy model in presence of weak positional disorder is studied in a square lattice by monte carlo methods . the critical exponent associated to the divergence of the chiral correlation length </S>",
    "<S> is found to be @xmath0 already at very small values of disorder . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the helicity modulus jump is found larger than the universal value expected in the xy model .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of the fully frustrated xy ( ffxy ) model@xcite in a planar lattices has attracted much attention since it provides a simple model for many physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it is related to josephson - junction arrays and superconducting wire networks in a magnetic field @xcite for which recent experiments show interesting properties@xcite . in these systems </S>",
    "<S> a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1 penetrates the array inducing a quenched vortex density . </S>",
    "<S> when the field is such that each plaquette of area @xmath2 in the planar lattice traps half a vortex , e.g. the ratio of the magnetic field to the flux unit @xmath3 , the system can be described by the ffxy model . as first noted by villain@xcite the ffxy model posses , besides the continous @xmath4 symmetry , a discrete @xmath5 symmetry which is not present in the unfrutrated xy model . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of two different symmetries leads to the possibility of two critical temperatures that have been investigated by both analytical methods@xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in spite of accurate mc simulations , the scenario is not fully understood . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there are numerical evidences supporting both the existence of two very close critical temperatures ( @xmath6 ) with critical behavior typical of ising and thouless - kosterlitz - berezinski ( tkb ) transitions respectively@xcite and the existence of a single transition with novel critical behavior@xcite . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> it has been claimed that the transition associated to the @xmath5 symmetry is characterized by a correlation length critical exponent @xmath7 lower than that expected in the ising case .    </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments on nb wire networks@xcite in an external magnetic field have shown that the critical exponent @xmath7 which can be extracted by the scaling of current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics , is in agreament neither with a ising - like exponent ( @xmath8 ) nor with the value suggested in ref.[@xcite ] ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the contrary , the scaling of the experimental data suggests a much larger value .    the aim of the present work is to investigate if the effect of weak quenched disorder in the ffxy model is able to change the critical behaviour of the system and to explain the unexpected critical behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the ffxy model is    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the phase in the site @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the line integral of the vector potential along the line ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 is the flux quantum . in order to simulate positional disorder </S>",
    "<S> we consider a uniform distribution of the @xmath16 whose average value @xmath17 is equal to @xmath18 every second column and zero otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> the disorder configuration is thus specified by the probability distribution    @xmath19    the parameter @xmath20 controls the degree of randomness and is related to the variance according to @xmath21 .    of course , the presence of positional disorder effects the behaviour of the model . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it has been shown by renormalization group techniques@xcite and monte carlo simulations@xcite that the critical temperatures associated to both @xmath5 and @xmath4 simmetries decrease with increasing disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it has been also suggested for the @xmath4 transition a reentrant behaviour , even if recent work on the disordered unfrustrated xy model seems to exclude this possibility@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the critical behaviour that characterize the ising - like and the tkb transitions have not been studied to our knowledge . in particular , the study of the critical exponent @xmath7 associated to the divergence of the coherence lenght of the ising - like transitions is interesting in view of its possible connection with the @xmath22 characteristics reported by ling@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact the experimental data i - v , or equivalently the data j - e , scale very well according to the relation@xcite @xmath23 where the dynamical critical exponent @xmath24 is found to be about 2 and @xmath25 . this type of scaling is consistent with the reasonable assumption that the relevant excitations that contribute to the critical behaviour of the i - v characteristic are domain - wall .    in order to obtain an estimation of @xmath7 we have calculated the binder s cumulant of the staggered magnetization @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath26 , associated to the chirality of each plaquette , is defined as @xmath28 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ m ] ) the chirality @xmath29 is the rotation of the current around a plaquette @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the phase difference at the edges of the plaquette .    </S>",
    "<S> binder s cumulant allows an accurate estimation of the critical temperature associated to the ordering of the plaquette chirality ( ising - like transition ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact @xmath32 does not depend on lattice size @xmath33 for large systems and , then , @xmath34 can be identified without making any assumption on the critical exponents . </S>",
    "<S> once a satisfactory estimation of @xmath34 is obtained the critical exponent @xmath7 is estimated through a data collapsing with the parameter @xmath7 only . </S>",
    "<S> the binder s cumulant @xmath35 has been calculated by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations using a standard metropolis dynamics . for each disorder configuration the mean value </S>",
    "<S> @xmath36 has been obtained averaging over @xmath37 mc sweeps after discarding the first @xmath38 for equilibrating the system . </S>",
    "<S> then the mean values are further averaged over a number of disorder configurations that range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 depending on lattice size and amount of disorder present in the system .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) it is shown how the critical temperature @xmath41 can be extracted by using the mc estimations of @xmath35 for different lattice sizes . in the case reported in the figure , </S>",
    "<S> if we exclude the smallest lattice size , @xmath42 , all the data cross about @xmath43 . from this type of analysis </S>",
    "<S> it is , then , possible to follow @xmath41 as a function of the disorder ( fig.2 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results confirm that @xmath41 decrease with increasing disorder going from @xmath44 for the case without disorder ( @xmath45 ) to @xmath46 for the case with largest disorder studied ( @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are in qualitative agreement with those reported by choi et al.@xcite . for larger values of the disorder preliminar results </S>",
    "<S> seems to suggest a continous collaps of @xmath41 . in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3a ) and 3b ) we show binder s cumulant @xmath35 as a function of @xmath48 for two values of @xmath20 . by using the estimated values of @xmath41 at @xmath49 and @xmath50 we see that the best data collapsing is obtained for @xmath51 in the case of lower disorder and for @xmath52 in the other case . </S>",
    "<S> even if the numerical errors do not allow a very accurate estimation of @xmath7 it is very clear that already for very weak disorder ( @xmath53 ) the critical exponent is quite different from that expected in the ising model ( @xmath8 ) and from that suggested by granato et al.@xcite in the case without disorder . </S>",
    "<S> instead the value obtained is very close to that extracted from the @xmath22 characteristics@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that a very similar value is obtained in the 2d xy spin glass that has a critical temperature @xmath54.@xcite the same analysis for @xmath45 and @xmath55 gives clearly @xmath56 and @xmath0 , respectively . on the other hand for the intermediate value @xmath57 </S>",
    "<S> the data are not able to clearly exclude either @xmath56 or @xmath0 ; larger lattices and more mc sweeps are needed to reach a satisfactory estimation of @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate the existence of a threshold disorder above which @xmath7 changes from 1 to 1.7 . the value of the threshold can be , then , estimated to be @xmath58 but it must be understood as an upper limit .    as in the ffxy model </S>",
    "<S> we expect the system to present a jump in the helicity modulus at temperature lower or equal to @xmath41 . in order to study this possibility </S>",
    "<S> we have calculated the helicity modulus that for the system studied takes the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the unitary vectors in the directions of the link @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the symbol @xmath64 indicates the average over the spin configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the elicity modulus @xmath65 has to be averaged further over the disorder configurations to obtain the mean value @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> following the analysis developed for the xy model@xcite and extended to the ffxy model@xcite we can estimate the critical temperature @xmath67 by using the following ansatz for the size dependence of @xmath66    @xmath68    where @xmath69 corresponds to the universal jump expected at the critical temperature in a ktb transition . </S>",
    "<S> this critical scaling , being based on the mapping between a neutral coulomb gas and a xy model , is valid only if the transition is of ktb type . </S>",
    "<S> therefore eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaling ] ) can be used as a test for the existence of a standard ktb transition .    in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4a ) and 4b ) we show the results of this analysis for two different values of the disorder . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> it is not possible to obtain a satisfactory fit of the data by using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ scaling ] ) with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a more accurate data analysis shows that a satisfying fitting of the data can be obtained assuming a helicity modulus jump larger than the universal value . </S>",
    "<S> from such an analysis we get @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath76 in both cases the fitting parameter @xmath77takes the same value found in the ffxy model without disorder , @xmath78,@xcite and @xmath67 is slightly smaller than @xmath41 even if the estimated numerical error does not rule out @xmath79 in the case of lowest disorder ( @xmath73).@xcite this analysis shows that the only way to fit the data with eq.([scaling ] ) is to assume a larger helicity modulus jump and this is an indication that the transition associated to this jump is not a ktb transition .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing we have calculated , by mc simulations , the critical temperature and the critical exponent @xmath7 associated to the chiral degree of freedom in a disordered ffxy model . </S>",
    "<S> unexpected we find that the critical exponent @xmath80 already for very weak disorder becomes equal to the value found in the xy spin glass , i.e. @xmath81 correspondently , the helicity modulus jump becomes larger than the universal value expected in ktb transition . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that the value obtained for @xmath7 is in agreement with recent results in josephson wire networks.@xcite    j. villain , j. phys . </S>",
