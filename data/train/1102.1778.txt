    "the treatment of the gap equation , in a self - consistent way , is equivalent to a one - loop calculation .",

    "<S> the model involves the propagation of massive quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of complex poles is interpreted as a confinement signal , and , in this case , we have unstable quasiparticles with a finite decay width . </S>",
    "<S> an expression for the propagator along the critical line , where complex poles start to appear , is also obtained . a generalization to other covariant regulators is proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) has been vastly considered for studying nonperturbative aspects of qcd . nowadays , it is mainly used to explore finite temperature and density effects in the frame of the mean - field approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the big challenges in qcd is to understand the confinement mechanism and the dynamics behind confinement . </S>",
    "<S> perturbative qcd can not describe confinement and , although lattice qcd is able to reproduce successfully hadron properties , like masses and coupling constants @xcite , it has problems when dealing with finite baryon chemical potential ( the sign problem ) . however , there are effective models which include explicitly confinement , as , for example , different versions of the bag model @xcite , dyson - schwinger models @xcite , or the polyakov loop effective action coupled to dyson - schwinger or njl models @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the nonlocal njl model ( nnjl ) is another attempt in this direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when the gluon degrees of freedom are integrated out in the qcd action , a nonlocal quark action emerges and confinement should be hidden there . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of the nnjl approach is to incorporate nonlocal vertices through the presence of appropriate regulators .    </S>",
    "<S> since the njl model is nonrenormalizable , a momentum cutoff is needed in order to handle the uv divergences . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of the model is , therefore , restricted to energy scales below the cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> nonlocal extensions of the njl model are designed to regularize the model in such a way that uv divergences are controlled , internal symmetries are preserved , and quark confinement is incorporated . the nnjl model has been extended to a finite temperature and density scenario @xcite through the usual matsubara formalism @xcite . here , nevertheless , the exact summation of matsubara frequencies turns out to be cumbersome , due to the complicated shape of the regulators . in most cases </S>",
    "<S> , it is necessary to cut the series at some order .    </S>",
    "<S> the idea of this work is to develop the finite temperature real time formalism for the nnjl model . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to calculate temperature corrections , providing a physical picture in terms of quasiparticles . on the one hand , those states with real masses can propagate freely in the deconfined phase . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the existence of complex poles of the propagator in the confined phase produces a strong damping avoiding the propagation of such states .    </S>",
    "<S> real time formalisms , as thermo - field dynamics or the schwinger - keldysh formalism , can be constructed through the analytic continuation of the euclidean action @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> those formalisms double the number of degrees of freedom , providing the appearance of a @xmath0 matrix propagator @xmath1 . in any version of the njl model in the mean - field approximation </S>",
    "<S> , the gap equation corresponds to a one - loop self - consistent relation , so we only need to find the @xmath2 component @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other matrix propagator components start to appear at the two - loop level . in the construction of the @xmath2 propagator </S>",
    "<S> , the main ingredient is given by the spectral density function . </S>",
    "<S> however , the construction of the spectral density function is not a simple task in a nonlocal frame , especially when dealing with a nontrivial analytic structure of the propagator .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we will develop the real time formalism for the gaussian regulator in the nnjl model , which can easily be extended to other kind of regulators . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we will get thermal propagators describing quasiparticles with temperature- and chemical - potential  </S>",
    "<S> dependent masses .    </S>",
