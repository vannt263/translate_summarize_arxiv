    "baryon - acoustic oscillations ( baos ) have emerged as one of the major probes of the expansion history of the universe . in the early universe ,",
    "the ionized baryons were kinematically coupled to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) of photons via thomson scattering .",
    "this baryon - photon fluid supported sound waves , sourced by primordial perturbations , that could travel a comoving distance @xmath1 prior to decoupling .",
    "this distance is precisely constrained by cmb observations to be @xmath2 mpc @xcite . after decoupling , the baryons became effectively pressureless at large scales , and the perturbations in the baryons and dark matter grew together in a single combined growing mode .",
    "thus at low redshift , _ all _ tracers of the matter density , either in dark matter or baryons , are predicted to show a feature in their correlation function at a position @xmath1  or equivalently oscillatory features in their power spectrum @xmath3 , with spacing @xmath4",
    ". this feature acts as a standard ruler , enabling galaxy redshift surveys to measure the distance - redshift relation @xmath5 , and ( using the radial direction ) the expansion rate @xmath6 .",
    "the bao scale is of interest because its distinctive shape and large scale make it less dependent on nonlinear evolution and galaxy formation physics than the broad - band power spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , the small amplitude of the feature makes it detectable only in very large surveys @xcite .",
    "the early detections of the bao in the clustering of low - redshift galaxies @xcite have given way to a string of results of ever - increasing precision @xcite .",
    "high - redshift measurements have become possible by using quasar spectra to trace large - scale structure in the autocorrelation function of the lyman-@xmath7 forest and in its cross - correlation with quasars @xcite . taken together ,",
    "these measurements have become one of the most important constraints on dark energy models @xcite .",
    "these successes have motivated a suite of future spectroscopic surveys to measure baos more precisely , including the prime focus spectrograph @xcite and the dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) @xcite in the optical , and _",
    "euclid _ @xcite and the _ wide - field infrared survey telescope _",
    "( _ wfirst _ ) @xcite in the infrared .",
    "they have also spawned novel concepts for measuring baos such as radio intensity mapping @xcite as planned for e.g.  the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment ( chime ) @xcite .",
    "the same acoustic oscillations that give rise to the bao also leave the baryons with an r.m.s .",
    "velocity of @xmath8 km / s relative to the dark matter at decoupling , coherent over scales of many comoving mpc .",
    "this velocity is cosmologically small at late times , since it decays @xmath9 .",
    "however , it was realized in 2010 that the sound speed in neutral hydrogen at the decoupling epoch is only 6 km / s , so this `` streaming velocity '' is supersonic @xcite and hence is more important than standard jeans - like filtering in determining the scale on which baryons can fall into dark matter potential wells .",
    "the filtering mass of the cold igm ( before re - heating by astrophysical sources ) is increased typically by a factor of @xmath10 relative to what it would be without the streaming velocities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the streaming velocity has order - unity spatial variations and a power spectrum showing prominent acoustic peaks @xcite .",
    "the effects of streaming velocities on gas accretion and cooling have been a subject of intense analytical and numerical investigation @xcite .",
    "it was soon realized that these ingredients implied that small , high - redshift galaxies whose abundance was modulated by the streaming velocity would show an unusual bao signature @xcite , and in some models the bao signature in the pre - reionization 21 cm signal could be strongly enhanced relative to the strength of the baos in the matter clustering alone @xcite . moreover , if low - redshift galaxies have any memory of the streaming velocity , then low - redshift bao measurements could be biased @xcite .",
    "while the direct effect of streaming velocities is on the small scale structure ( @xmath11few@xmath12 ) , feedback processes associated with reionization or metal enrichment could influence the subsequent evolution of more massive galaxies in a way that is difficult to predict from first principles @xcite . in the absence of a first - principles theory ,",
    "this effect can be parameterized in terms of the `` streaming velocity bias ''",
    "@xmath13 , which is the excess probability to find a galaxy in a region with r.m.s .  streaming velocity versus a region with zero streaming velocity .",
    "studies based on perturbation theory have found that the bao ruler shrinks ( stretches ) for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .    in this paper , we compute the effect of streaming velocities on the bao feature including all leading - order terms ; we find that the largest term was missing from previous work .",
    "the galaxy density , a scalar , can not depend on the direction of the streaming velocity , but only on its magnitude ( or square ) . in linear perturbation theory with gaussian initial conditions ,",
    "the density ( an odd moment ) can not correlate with the velocity - squared ( an even moment ) , one must go to the next order to obtain a nonzero result .",
    "previous investigations included three such effects : ( i ) the nonlinear evolution of the matter density field ; ( ii ) nonlinear galaxy bias ; and ( iii ) the autocorrelation of the streaming velocity field .",
    "we show that to consistent order in perturbation theory , two additional terms appear : ( iv ) the dependence of the galaxy abundance on the local tidal field @xcite ; and ( v ) an `` advection term , '' since galaxy properties depend on the past streaming velocity at their lagrangian position .",
    "we find that for plausible bias parameters , the tidal effect is small , but the advection term greatly enhances the shift in bao position and impacts the shape and amplitude of the bao feature . because knowing the correct bao scale is required to relate observed galaxy clustering to underlying cosmological physics , understanding the impact of streaming velocities is critical if we are to obtain unbiased results from the future generation of high - precision measurements .",
    "we first construct a model for the distribution of galaxies .",
    "we describe our notations , choice of cosmology , and normalization conventions in  [ ss : conventions ] , before proceeding in  [ ss : gbias ] to building the model for the distribution of galaxies .",
    "we work in real space in this paper , leaving the redshift - space treatment to future work .",
    "the fiducial cosmology is the base 6-parameter _ planck _ + `` everything '' model @xcite : flat @xmath16cdm with @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 ; @xmath21 ( at @xmath22 mpc@xmath20 ) ; @xmath23 ; and @xmath24 .    the streaming velocity field @xmath25 can be computed on large scales in linear perturbation theory , and scales @xmath9 once the baryons have decoupled and are effectively pressureless .",
    "following the notation of ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the normalized streaming velocity field to be @xmath26 where the average in the denominator is taken over all positions @xmath27 . by dividing out @xmath28 , we obtain a normalized streaming velocity that is independent of redshift and is of order unity . note",
    "that some authors @xcite have defined an alternative variable @xmath29 , equivalent to @xmath30 here , which has an r.m.s .",
    "value of 1 _ per axis _ ( see eq .  [ eq : dg - model ] ) .    at linear order , the relative velocity field in fourier space can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the ratio of transfer functions that map initial curvature fluctuations into late - time matter and velocity fluctuations .",
    "note that with this definition , even though @xmath33 is redshift - independent , @xmath34 decays as @xmath35 , where @xmath5 is the growth factor .",
    "the appropriate transfer function can be obtained from a boltzmann code  we used both camb @xcite and class @xcite , obtaining consistent results  and the normalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : v_def ] ) at any desired redshift @xmath36 can be obtained by enforcing the integral : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the linear matter power spectrum .",
    "the choice of @xmath39 is set by the minimum scale relevant for the formation of the relevant tracer , e.g.  its lagrangian radius . in practice , we find that @xmath28 is nearly insensitive to the choice of @xmath39 unless fluctuations below the pre - reionization baryonic jeans scale are included .",
    "these fluctuations are not relevant for galaxy formation , and we thus choose @xmath40 .",
    "we will also need the tidal field magnitude @xmath41 . here",
    "the traceless - symmetric dimensionless tidal tensor @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 .",
    "we now write a model for the overdensity of a given tracer of large - scale structure , @xmath44",
    ". this tracer population could be e.g.  galaxies , lyman-@xmath7 absorption , or the unresolved h i 21 cm emissivity .",
    "while the detailed physics of the formation and evolution of these tracer populations remains an outstanding problem , nonlinear galaxy biasing @xcite provides a useful framework to study the streaming velocity effect .",
    "this theory is based on the idea that galaxy formation is _ local _ , with the only long - range physics being gravity . under these assumptions ,",
    "the galaxy overdensity measured on scales large compared to the range of galaxy formation physics should depend only on the density and tidal fields , the local streaming velocity , and their past history ( since galaxy formation , while local in space , is obviously not local in time ) . at small scales",
    ", additional terms can appear involving derivatives of the density or tidal field , but as we are interested in large scales we do not include these . note that any terms involving past history should be based on the history at fixed lagrangian position , since small - scale structure , metal enrichment , and similar properties are advected by large - scale velocity fields rather than remaining in a fixed eulerian cell .",
    "since galaxy overdensity is a scalar , its dependence on @xmath45 must be at least quadratic .",
    "the leading corrections to the linear galaxy 2-point function are from terms of @xmath46 in the linear density field @xmath47 , since terms of @xmath48 vanish for gaussian initial conditions .",
    "it follows that the galaxy biasing model we require should go up to @xmath48 . since our primary interest is the contributions coming from streaming velocities , we neglect @xmath48 contributions to the density field that do not involve @xmath49 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "the lagrangian position ( i.e. comoving position of the particles just after the big bang ) is denoted @xmath53 to distinguish it from eulerian position @xmath54 . in this formulation , it is the linear @xmath45 that is evaluated at @xmath53 , while the advection of the density and tidal fields is already included through the perturbative expansion of the density field . although eq .",
    "( [ eq : dg - model ] ) expresses the astrophysical motivation for the advection contribution , this term can be derived from a purely eulerian perspective , as shown in appendix  [ app : eulerian ] .",
    "indeed , as we demonstrate , the advection term is required to preserve galilean invariance .",
    "the definitions of the bias coefficients are not standardized : while our @xmath13 is equivalent to that of @xcite , @xmath55 in @xcite is related to both via @xmath56 .",

    "we have examined the impact of streaming velocities on the tracer correlation function , considering all contributions at @xmath46 and including two terms not considered in previous work . while we find the correlation of the tidal field and the streaming velocity to be small , the contribution from advection is significant , dominating the total effect of streaming velocities on the bao feature .",
    "the importance of advection is due to the rapid change in streaming velocity correlations at the bao scale . for a simple illustration ,",
    "consider a single @xmath51-function overdensity that has evolved to decoupling ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "dark matter at all separations infalls towards the overdensity . within the acoustic scale ,",
    "baryons are roughly in hydrostatic equilibrium . just inside the acoustic scale",
    ", baryons move outward due to radiation pressure , while just outside this scale , baryons match the dark matter infall ( e.g.  figure 2 of ref .",
    "thus , the streaming velocity , @xmath95 , rapidly changes at the acoustic scale , and advection can move tracers separated by roughly this scale between regions of different @xmath95 . indeed",
    ", this effect is nearly maximal , since the first - order displacement is almost entirely anti - correlated with the relative velocity direction ( correlation coefficient of @xmath96 ) .",
    "the qualitative behavior expected from this simplified picture can be seen in figure  [ fig : corr_comp ] : at the bao scale , advection has carried in tracers that formed at slightly larger scales , where @xmath95 is much smaller .",
    "thus , for positive ( negative ) @xmath85 the observed correlation function is suppressed ( enhanced ) .",
    "the overall effect is to shift the observed bao feature to smaller ( larger ) scales and to suppress ( enhance ) its amplitude .",
    "the effect of advection boosts the impact of @xmath13 , dramatically increasing the range of parameter space over which streaming velocities are relevant to large - scale structure surveys .",
    "conversely , advection makes @xmath13 significantly easier to detect , providing a potential window into the astrophysics of streaming velocities and tracer formation .",
    "for instance , desi will obtain an overall bao - scale measurement of order @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) , corresponding to the shift induced by streaming velocities at @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the ultimate impact of streaming velocities will depend on the as - yet - unknown value and sign of @xmath13 , as well as other possible bias terms related to differences in the baryon and cdm fluids ( see appendix  [ app : eulerian ] ) .",
    "their direct effect is to suppress the infall of baryons into halos by a fractional amount @xmath100 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this scaling results from the fact that the suppression is proportional to @xmath101 , and is @xmath102 when the streaming - enhanced filtering scale is the halo mass , which suggests a contribution to @xmath13 of order a few @xmath103 at galaxy mass scales .",
    "we view this as a `` soft '' lower bound on @xmath13 in the sense that e.g.  reionization physics may be much more important and thus dominate @xmath13 , but there is no reason for a precise cancellation that would give a total @xmath104 . on the other hand , very large values ( @xmath105 ) would disrupt the qualitative agreement with current observations .",
    "the effect of streaming velocities may also be relevant for other luminous tracers of large - scale structure , notably the lyman-@xmath7 forest and ( possibly ) unresolved 21 cm emission ; these tracers are sensitive to a range of mass scales down to the post - reionization jeans scale ( few@xmath106 @xmath107 ) , and their @xmath13 may be correspondingly larger . we leave a more detailed consideration of astrophysical effects that impact @xmath13 for future work . we also defer consideration of reconstruction ( which may have significant impact on displacements ) @xcite and redshift - space distortions in the context of streaming velocities .    while we have primarily considered the impact of streaming velocities on the _ position _ of the bao feature , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : corr_comp ] that the bao _ shape _ is also significantly altered .",
