    "testing hypotheses on the covariance matrix of the disturbances in a regression model is an important problem in econometrics and statistics , a prime example being testing the hypothesis of uncorrelatedness of the disturbances .",
    "two particularly important cases are ( i ) testing for autocorrelation in time series regressions and ( ii ) testing for spatial autocorrelation in spatial models ; for an overview see @xcite and @xcite . for testing autocorrelation in time series regressions",
    "the most popular test is probably the durbin - watson test .",
    "while low power of this test against highly correlated alternatives in some instances had been noted earlier by @xcite and @xcite , @xcite seems to have been the first to show that the limiting power of the durbin - watson test as autocorrelation goes to one can actually be zero .",
    "this phenomenon has become known as the _ zero - power trap_. the work by @xcite has been followed up and extended in the context of testing against autoregressive disturbances of order one in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , these results show that the power of the durbin - watson test ( and of a class of related tests ) typically converges to either one or zero ( depending on whether a certain observable quantity is below or above a threshold ) as the strength of autocorrelation increases , provided that there is no intercept in the regression ( in the sense that the vector of ones is not in the span of the regressor matrix ) ; in case an intercept is in the regression , the limit is typically neither zero nor one .",
    "some of these results were extended in @xcite to the case where the durbin - watson test is used , but the disturbances are fractionally integrated . in the context of spatial regression models",
    "kramer2005 showed that the cliff - ord test can similarly be affected by the zero - power trap .",
    "@xcite set out to build a general theory for power properties of tests of a hypothesis on the covariance matrix of the disturbances in a linear regression , that would also uncover the mechanism responsible for the phenomena observed in the before - cited literature . while the intuition behind the general results in @xcite is often correct , the results themselves and/or their proofs are not .",
    "for example , the main result ( theorem 1 in @xcite ) , on which much of that paper rests , has some serious flaws : parts of the theorem are incorrect , and the proofs of the correct parts are substantially in error .",
    "in particular , the proof in @xcite is based on a `` concentration '' effect , which , however , is simply not present in the setting of the proof of theorem 1 in @xcite , as the relevant distributions `` stretch out '' rather than `` concentrate '' .",
    "this has already been observed in @xcite , where a way to circumvent the problems was suggested .",
    "mynbaev s approach , which is based on the `` stretch - out effect '' , is somewhat cumbersome in that it requires the development of tools dealing with the `` stretch - out effect '' ; furthermore , the treatment in @xcite is given only for a subclass of the tests considered in @xcite and under more restrictive distributional assumptions than in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we now build a theory as envisioned in @xcite at an even more general level .",
    "in particular , we allow for general invariant tests including randomized ones , we employ weaker conditions on the underlying covariance model as well as on the distributions of the disturbances ( e.g. , we even allow for distributions that are not absolutely continuous ) .",
    "one aspect of our theory is to show how invariance of the tests considered can be used to convert martellosio s intuition about the `` concentration '' effect into a precise mathematical argument .",
    "furthermore , advantages of this approach over the approach in @xcite are that ( i )  standard weak convergence arguments can be used ( avoiding the need for new tools to handle the `` stretch - out '' effect ) , ( ii ) more general classes of tests can be treated , and ( iii ) much weaker distributional assumptions are required . the general theory built in this paper",
    "is then applied to tests for spatial autocorrelation , which , in particular , leads to correct versions of the results in @xcite that pertain to spatial models .",
    "a further contribution of the present paper is a characterization of the situation where no invariant test can distinguish the null hypothesis of no correlation from the alternative .",
    "this characterization helps to explain , and provides a unifying framework for , phenomena observed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after laying out the framework in section [ framework ] , the general theory is developed in section [ main ] .",
    "the main results are theorems [ mt ] , [ bt ] , and [ bt2 ] . theorem",
    "[ mt ] , specialized to nonrandomized tests , shows that under appropriate assumptions the power of an invariant test converges to @xmath0 or @xmath1 as the `` boundary '' of the alternative is approached .",
    "the limit is @xmath0 or @xmath1 depending on whether a certain observable vector @xmath2 ( the `` concentration direction '' of the underlying covariance model ) belongs to the complement of the closure or to the interior of the rejection region of the test .",
    "this result constitutes a generalization of the correct parts of theorem 1 in @xcite ( the proofs of which in @xcite are incorrect ) .",
    "theorems [ bt ] and [ bt2 ] deal with the case where the concentration direction @xmath2 belongs to the boundary of the rejection region , a case excluded from theorem [ mt ] , thus providing correct versions of the incorrect part of theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "the general results obtained in theorems [ mt ] , [ bt ] , and [ bt2 ] are then specialized in section [ t_b ] to the important class of tests based on test statistics that are ratios of quadratic forms .",
    "the relationship between test size and the zero - power trap is discussed in section [ alpha_star ] , before indistinguishability of the null and alternative hypothesis by invariant tests is characterized in section [ ip ] .",
    "extensions of the general theory are discussed in section [ gen ] ; in particular , we discuss ways of relaxing the distributional assumptions .",
    "section [ spatial ] is devoted to applying the general theory to testing for spatial correlation , while section [ ar1c ] contains an application to testing for autocorrelation in time series regression models . whereas the problems with theorem 1 in @xcite are discussed in section [ main ] as well as in appendix [ newapp ] , problems with a number of other results in @xcite are dealt with in appendix [ a2 ] .",
