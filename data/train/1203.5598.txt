    "the de broglie - bohm mechanics gives results which are equivalent to the copenhagen version of quantum mechanics .",
    "however it gives further information about the trajectories of particles , or fluid elements of a probabilistic fluid , given by the probability @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the de broglie - bohm equations of motion are @xmath4    the quantum trajectories are either ordered or chaotic .",
    "the problem of chaos in the de broglie - bohm theory has been studied extensively ( indicative references are @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite ) . in four previous papers @xcite@xcite@xcite )",
    "@xcite we studied in detail the basic mechanism by which chaos is generated when the trajectories come close to _ nodal points _",
    ", where @xmath5 .",
    "the appearance of _ quantum vortices _ at nodal points is a well known phenomenon @xcite , which , besides chaos , leads to a number of interesting consequences for quantum dynamics in general ( e.g. @xcite@xcite @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "quantitative studies of chaos related to the effects of vortices are presented in @xcite@xcite @xcite .",
    "the fact that the generation of chaos is due to the _ motion _ of quantum vortices was first pointed out in @xcite(see also @xcite ) .",
    "our own main result was to show that chaos is due to the formation ( by moving nodal points ) of ` nodal point - x - point complexes ' @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "more specifically , we found that near every nodal point there is a hyperbolic point , called x - point , that has two unstable directions , opposite to each other , and two stable directions , again opposite to each other .",
    "chaos is introduced when a trajectory approaches such an x - point .",
    "furthermore chaos is stronger when the x - point is closer to the nodal point .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the existence of an x - point close to a nodal point is a consequence of the topological properties of the quantum flow holding in the neighborhood of nodal points for an arbitrary form of the wavefunction .",
    "furthermore , we made a theoretical analysis of the dependence of the lyapunov characteristic numbers of the quantum trajectories on the size and speed of the quantum vortices .",
    "roughly , the local value of lyapunov characteristic numbers scales inversely proportionally to the distance of a quantum trajectory from the stable manifold of the x - point , and to the speed of the nodal point .",
    "furthermore , the size of the nodal point - x - point complex scales inversely proportionally to the speed of the nodal point .",
    "these properties were used to estimate how close a trajectory must approach the x - point for chaos to become effective , thus explaining numerical results found in @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand trajectories that never approach a",
    "`` nodal point - x point complex '' are ordered .",
    "such trajectories were considered in @xcite ( called hereafter ekc ) . in that paper",
    "we found the trajectories and the nodal lines ( i.e. the lines formed by moving nodal points ) in the case of a simple model of a 2d harmonic oscillator , when one considers a superposition of three eigenfunctions .",
    "other examples of ordered orbits , following a similar analysis , were given in @xcite .",
    "in ekc we found the forms of the nodal lines and some limiting curves that are never crossed by the nodal lines .",
    "in fact we found that the nodal lines never come ( a ) close to the center or close to the axis @xmath6 ( b ) close to the axis @xmath7 for large absolute values of @xmath8 , and ( c ) large values of both @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is exemplified in fig.[haordcha]a , b , referring to an example of trajectory calculations taken from ekc ( see section 2 below for details ) . the main effect to be noted",
    "is that there are empty regions left by the nodal lines .",
    "as shown in ekc and in @xcite , the appearance of order is due to the presence of such regions devoid of nodal points at all times @xmath10 .",
    "further examples in a different ( square - box ) model were given in @xcite .",
    "the most notable physical consequence of the existence of regular trajectories is related to a phenomenon called _ quantum relaxation _ @xcite@xcite .",
    "if we allow the initial conditions of the bohmian particles to obey a probability distribution @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the initial wavefunction , then , under some conditions we find that @xmath13 approaches @xmath14 asymptotically , at a coarse - grained level , as the time @xmath10 increases .",
    "the possibility to obtain an asymptotic approach of @xmath15 to @xmath16 due to stochastic fluctuations of the motion of the probabilistic fluid elements was first pointed out by bohm and vigier @xcite .",
    "however , the theory of valentini @xcite does not rely on extra assumptions besides the absence of the so - called micro - state fine structure in the initial distribution of the particles .",
    "quantum relaxation has been observed in a number of numerical simulations ( @xcite@xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the main condition for its effectiveness , however , is that the trajectories considered must be _",
    "chaotic_. in fact , it is known that the existence of ordered trajectories limits the effectiveness of quantum relaxation @xcite .",
    "since the physics of quantum relaxation has attracted recent interest in a variety of physical contexts ( e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite ) , it is important to understand , besides the mechanisms of chaos , also the mechanisms by which order appears in de broglie - bohm mechanics .",
    "this is our purpose in the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we consider inner ordered trajectories , i.e. ordered trajectories appearing in the central region of the configuration space of the same model as in ekc .",
    "in particular , using perturbation series we explain why there can be some ordered trajectories partly overlapping with the domain covered by nodal lines in this model . in section 3",
    "we discuss the issue of convergence of the perturbation series representing the regular trajectories .",
    "section 4 deals with ordered trajectories far from the center , i.e. beyond the domain covered by nodal lines . in section 5",
    "we discuss ordered trajectories in a more general ( hnon - heiles ) model than the 2d harmonic oscillator .",
    "section 6 deals with the impact of order on the effect of quantum relaxation , while section 7 discusses further examples and some quantitative analysis of the same subject .",
    "finally , section 8 presents the main conclusions of the present study .",
    "in ekc we considered the bohmian trajectories in the 2d harmonic oscillator model : @xmath17 when the guiding field is the superposition of the ground state and the two first excited states @xmath18 with real amplitudes @xmath19 and incommensurable frequencies @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the equations of motion are : @xmath22 where @xmath23    as shown in ekc , the domains covered by the nodal lines are hyperbola - like , leaving both inner and outer domains devoid of nodal points .",
    "the nodal points are at @xmath24     is a superposition of three states ( eq.([eigenharm ] ) ) , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "( a ) an ordered trajectory with @xmath27 , and ( b ) a chaotic trajectory with @xmath28 . in the background",
    "we mark the nodal lines , i.e. the solutions for @xmath29 of the equation @xmath30 . ]",
    "trajectories that never approach the ` nodal point - x point complex ' are ordered .",
    "such trajectories were found in ekc both numerically and by analytical expansions . we can explicitly show that whether an orbit is regular or chaotic depends on how close the orbit can come to the nodal point .",
    "furthermore , we find that almost symmetric initial conditions can give rise to quite different trajectories ( ordered or chaotic ) , because the overlapping of the initial conditions with the domain of the nodal lines does not guarantee that there is a close encounter ( in both space a time ) of the trajectories with the nodal point .",
    "as an example , trajectories starting on the upper right quadrant are regular , even if their initial conditions are located in a region occupied by the nodal lines ( fig.[haordcha]a , case @xmath27 ) , while trajectories starting in the lower left region occupied by the nodal lines are chaotic ( fig.[haordcha]b , case @xmath28 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that , when the moving point is close to its maximum ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , it can be shown that the nodal point is always far from the moving point in the first case ( @xmath27 ) , while it comes several times close to it in the second case ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "a rough estimate of the position of the moving point can be given by a first order theory .",
    "namely , from eqs.([eqmo ] ) we derive up to first order in @xmath19 : @xmath31 @xmath32 these expressions are found in practice to be fairly accurate well beyond the domain ( in @xmath19 ) where the convergence of the series representing @xmath8 or @xmath9 can be rigorously established ( see section 3 below ) , and for initial conditions @xmath33 satisfying @xmath34 ( see ekc ) . using the approximate expression ( [ solx1 ] ) , we find that we have a maximum @xmath35 when @xmath36 provided that the time @xmath10 specified by ( [ max1 ] ) satisfies the inequality @xmath37 equation ( [ max1 ] ) gives the times of the maximum @xmath8 .",
    "if the quantity @xmath38 is relatively small ( e.g. @xmath39 ) the times of maximum @xmath10 are close to @xmath40 for some integer @xmath41 . then , we can write @xmath42 with @xmath43 = -q\\sin ( c2k\\pi)\\ ] ] and the inequality ( [ max2 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "at such a time the nodal point is near the position @xmath44",
    "@xmath45    , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 are a trajectory s coordinates and @xmath48 are the nodal point coordinates at various times @xmath10 , ( a ) for the ordered trajectory , and ( b ) for the chaotic trajectory of fig.[haordcha ] . ]    therefore when @xmath8 is at its maximum the nodal point is at a negative @xmath49 . thus if @xmath50 , @xmath51 the moving point is in the upper right quadrant , while the nodal point ( @xmath52 ) is in the upper left quadrant , i.e. far from the moving point . on the other hand",
    "if @xmath53 , @xmath54 the moving point at its maximum @xmath8 is in the lower left quadrant , and the nodal point is also in the lower left quadrant , therefore the two points can be close and this closeness introduces chaos .",
    "the difference between the ordered case @xmath27 and the chaotic case @xmath28 can be seen in figs.[haordchand]a , b where we give the points ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) whenever the distance @xmath57 goes through a local minimum in time . in this figure",
    "the nodal point is at @xmath58 .",
    "we see that in the first case the local minima @xmath59 in time never approach the value @xmath60 , while in the second case @xmath59 sometimes approaches zero .",
    "this explains why the first trajectory is ordered , while the second trajectory is chaotic .",
    "the series representing regular orbits can be convergent only within a certain domain in the space of parameters ( @xmath19 in the case of the model ( [ eigenharm ] ) ) , and/or in the initial conditions @xmath33 .",
    "however , in some simple cases we can show that there are regular orbits even beyond the domains of convergence of the series constructed to represent such orbits .",
    "one such example is found when @xmath61 . in this case",
    "all the trajectories in the model ( [ eigenharm ] ) are periodic , with period @xmath62 , thus they are regular .",
    "such trajectories were considered in @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion take a simple form : @xmath63 thus , all the trajectories are straight horizontal lines , i.e. @xmath64 .     when @xmath26 , @xmath61 and ( a ) @xmath65 , ( b ) @xmath66 .",
    "the two horizontal lines in each plot mark the interval of convergence of the series in the x - axis .",
    "the crossing of these lines by the series solution for @xmath67 indicates that the series are divergent . ]    now , a series representation for the solution @xmath67 can be obtained as a limiting case of the expansion considered in section 2 .",
    "we set @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is of order @xmath70 in the parameter @xmath71 . for any fixed value of @xmath72 ,",
    "such a series is valid in the domain of analyticity of the function appearing in the r.h.s . of eq.([eqper ] ) with respect to @xmath71 ( considered as a complex variable ) .",
    "the latter domain can be determined by finding the nearest pole ( with respect to the origin ) of the function @xmath73 , where @xmath74 . for fixed @xmath75 ,",
    "the solution of @xmath76 is @xmath77 thus the nearest pole is at the distance @xmath78 for all times @xmath10 .",
    "the latter property allows for an easy numerical convergence test of the series representing @xmath67 .",
    "i.e. , for a fixed value of @xmath71 , we compute a finite truncation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a ( finite ) truncation order , and check whether the numerically computed values of @xmath67 by the above expression ever cross the limit @xmath81 in the interval @xmath82 .",
    "figure 3 shows this criterion , when @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath71 is given two different values , namely @xmath65 ( fig.3a ) and @xmath66 ( fig.3b ) .",
    "the horizontal straight lines correspond to the limit @xmath85 .",
    "the crossing of this limit takes place a little beyond @xmath65 , thus we conclude that the series representing periodic trajectories are divergent beyond this value of @xmath71 .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that the fact that the series are divergent only implies that the method used to compute these series no longer yields a useful representation of the true trajectories , since , in fact , the true trajectories _ are _ regular ( because they are periodic ) .    the same effect is found when @xmath86 , i.e. we can establish the existence of regular orbits by numerical means even when the series constructed to represent them are divergent . in such cases , a low order truncation of the series",
    "is often found to continue to represent some features of the true orbits .    , @xmath26 , and @xmath87 .",
    "( b ) the time evolution of the ` finite time lyapunov characteristic number ' @xmath88 ( see text ) for the same trajectory , up to the time @xmath89 .",
    "the asymptotic logarithmic slope is @xmath90 , indicating that the trajectory is regular . ]",
    "the regular character of the trajectories can be established numerically by computing their lyapunov characteristic numbers .",
    "such a test is shown in figure [ hatriangle ] , referring to a trajectory in the model ( [ eigenharm ] ) for @xmath91 , @xmath26 and initial conditions @xmath87 .",
    "this trajectory was considered in @xcite ( fig.12c , d of that paper ) , and it was found that the series representation of the trajectory clearly diverges . in order to check whether the trajectory s character remains regular over longer time intervals , we computed the same trajectory , along with its variational equations , with a very precise time step @xmath92 up to a time @xmath89 .",
    "figure [ hatriangle]b shows the evolution of the ` finite time lyapunov characteristic number ' @xmath93 for this trajectory , where @xmath94 is the length of a deviation vector computed from the variational equations of motion .",
    "the lyapunov characteristic number is the limit @xmath95 .",
    "this limit is positive for chaotic trajectories , while it is zero for regular trajectories , for which @xmath88 follows the asymptotic behavior @xmath96 .",
    "this is exactly the average power law found in the case of fig.[hatriangle]b .",
    "thus , all numerical indications are that this particular trajectory is regular , i.e. the domain of initial conditions and parameters leading to regular trajectories extends beyond the rigorous lower bounds provided by perturbation theory .",
    "trajectories restricted far from the nodal lines are ordered . for the trajectories starting in the upper right domain beyond the set of nodal lines , and close to the diagonal , the initial conditions @xmath33 are both absolutely large .",
    "therefore , @xmath97 , @xmath98 are small .",
    "we then set @xmath99 whereby it follows that @xmath100 . assuming that the trajectories only make small oscillations around the values @xmath101 , we may write expansions of the form @xmath102 in which we require that the quantities @xmath103 , @xmath104 contain only terms with coefficients @xmath105 satisfying @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .    upon substitution of ( [ xyexp ] ) into ( [ eqmo ] ) , where , in addition , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , the equations of motion for @xmath110 split into terms of like orders @xmath111 . in the first and second orders we find the trivial equations @xmath112 from which the solutions @xmath113 are selected .",
    "the third and fourth order equations read @xmath114 with solution @xmath115 and @xmath116 with solution @xmath117 respectively .",
    "higher order terms can be found by implementing the recursive scheme .",
    ".the minimum and maximum values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 for some ordered orbits far from the center ( initial conditions @xmath118 as indicated in the first column ) , using a series representation ( eq.[xyexp ] ) up to the fourth , or the fifteenth , order , as compared to numerical results .",
    "the last trajectory , for @xmath119 , is chaotic .",
    "thus , its series representation is no longer useful .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we checked the approximation of the numerical trajectories , when @xmath25 and @xmath26 , by the series expansions ( [ xyexp ] ) calculated up to order 15 via a computer algebraic program , we find that for @xmath33 large enough the approximation is excellent .",
    "however , as we decrease @xmath120 or @xmath121 the deviations between the analytical and numerical results become appreciable .",
    "in fact , the trajectories of these initial conditions are still ordered and perform simple oscillations , although the analytical curves by the series expansions undergo large deviations .",
    "the level of approximation , as we decrease @xmath33 , can be judged from table i yielding the analytical maxima and minima of the oscillating functions @xmath67 and @xmath122 as derived from the series truncated at orders @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "these numbers are compared with the limits of the trajectories found numerically . in all cases",
    "we take @xmath25 , @xmath26 . for @xmath125",
    "the agreement of both the 4th and 15th order approximations with the numerical results is very good .    , a chaotic orbit ( @xmath126 ) , and an ordered orbit in the outer regular domain ( @xmath127 ) of the 2d harmonic oscillator model . the trajectories are plotted on top of the nodal lines .",
    "]    on the other hand , for @xmath33 smaller than @xmath128 ( but not smaller than 1 ) the trajectories come into the domain of the nodal lines ( fig.[hainout ] ) and the trajectories become chaotic .",
    "this result shows that the chaotic trajectories are limited in a region covered by nodal lines ( and even then some trajectories are still ordered if they do not approach the nodal points , as we have seen in the previous section ) .",
    "the main features of the quantum trajectories in the 2d harmonic oscillator model are maintained to a large extent if we consider perturbations of this model .",
    "such perturbations present particular interest in various physical contexts ranging from molecular dynamics to quantum field theory .    as a simple nonlinear extension of the 2d harmonic oscillator model we consider the case of the hnon - heiles hamiltonian @xmath129 as in @xcite",
    ", we consider the case @xmath20 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .    , but for the hnon - heiles model . ]    in order to compute a wavefunction in the above model which , as in the case of the wavefunction ( [ eigenharm ] ) of the 2d harmonic oscillator model , is the sum of the ground state and two states with quantum numbers ( 1,0 ) and ( 1,1 ) , we first compute a @xmath132 truncation of the hamiltonian matrix of ( [ hh ] ) using the basis functions of the 2d harmonic oscillator .",
    "the matrix elements considered are given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the hamiltonian operator corresponding to ( [ hh ] ) expressed in the position representation , while @xmath135 is the i - th eigenstate of the 2d harmonic oscillator model in the same representation .",
    "the index @xmath136 is related to the 2d harmonic oscillator quantum numbers @xmath137 according to the bijective relation @xmath138 .",
    "thus , the i - th eigenvalue of the hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) satisfies the relation @xmath139 . by diagonalizing the truncated real symmetric matrix @xmath140 , with entries @xmath141 , @xmath142 , we find the eigenvalues @xmath143 and the corresponding normalized eigenvectors @xmath144 , given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 , @xmath147 are the entries of the i - th column of the orthogonal diagonalizing matrix @xmath148 satisfying @xmath149 . using the fact that the relation @xmath150 is bijective , for @xmath151 sufficiently small",
    "we can assign quantum numbers to the i - th state of the hnon - heiles system via the inverse functions @xmath152 , @xmath153 . using the above procedure ,",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenstates up to @xmath154 are computed with an estimated precision of six significant figures .",
    "furthermore , we denote by @xmath155 and @xmath156 the state @xmath157 as given by eq.([eigvechh ] ) and the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath158 respectively .    in order , now , to make a comparison of the de broglie - bohm trajectories in the harmonic oscillator and in the hnon - heiles system , we study the trajectories under the wavefunction @xmath159 we have examined various values of the real parameters @xmath19 , as in the case of the 2d harmonic oscillator model .    figure [ hhinout ] shows an example of three bohmian trajectories in the above model , i.e. ( i ) an inner ordered , ( ii ) a chaotic , and ( iii ) an outer ordered trajectory .",
    "this figure compares quite well with the corresponding figure for the 2d harmonic oscillator model ( fig.[hainout ] ) , showing that ordered bohmian trajectories persist even for perturbed hamiltonians of the form ( [ hh ] ) .",
    "in fact , by plotting also the nodal lines ( gray in fig.[hhinout ] ) , we note that they represent , to a large extent , a deformation of the nodal lines appearing in the respective figure ( fig.[haordcha ] ) for the 2d harmonic oscillator model .",
    "in fact , the only noticeable difference concerns the right part of the @xmath160 square in fig.([hhinout ] ) , for large ( positive or negative ) values of @xmath9 and @xmath161 .",
    "namely , while the nodal lines in fig.[hainout ] tend to an asymptote at @xmath6 for large @xmath9 , the nodal lines in fig.[hhinout ] form two nearly horizontal zones at @xmath162 .",
    "this , however , can only affect trajectories very far from the center ( i.e. corresponding to an exponentially small probability ) , while the main form of the trajectories , as shown in fig.[hhinout ] , follows the same features as analyzed in sections 3 and 4 for the 2d harmonic oscillator model .",
    "the theory of _ quantum relaxation _ , introduced by valentini @xcite , provides an extension of ordinary quantum mechanics leading to interesting physical consequences both for quantum particles @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite as well as quantum fields @xcite@xcite .",
    "briefly , the theory explores the consequences of allowing the possibility that a set of initial conditions of de broglie - bohm trajectories have an initial probability density @xmath163 deviating from the one postulated by born s rule i.e. @xmath164 , where @xmath12 is the initial wavefunction .",

    "it can be shown that @xmath170 satisfies the inequality @xmath171 , but we emphasize that this does _ not _ imply that @xmath172 is a monotonically decreasing function in time .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to construct states such that @xmath173 even if @xmath168 differs significantly from @xmath16 from cell to cell , since the integrand in ( [ hf ] ) can be both positive or negative .",
    "however , simulations indicate that the quantum relaxation is a numerical fact in several cases . in subsequent calculations ,",
    "we probe directly the approach of @xmath165 to @xmath16 on the basis of an alternative indicator , namely the integral of the absolute difference @xmath174 over the whole configuration space ( see below ) , discussing also the relevance of this test to tests based on the temporal behavior of the h - function .",
    "the interest in the quantum - relaxation theory is twofold : i ) it provides a dynamical basis for deriving ( rather than postulating ) born s rule , and ii ) it leads to interesting new physics if we consider that fluctuations from born s rule have a considerable amplitude during the early stages of evolution of particular quantum systems . a specific",
    "implementation regards the dynamical behavior of quantum fluctuations in the early universe @xcite@xcite .",
    "in fact , it was found @xcite that if there were deviations from _ quantum equilibrium _",
    "( i.e. born s rule ) in the early universe , these could have led to detectable imprints in some observables encountered in the framework of physical cosmology ( e.g. in the cbr spectrum ) .",
    "concrete numerical simulations of the relaxation mechanism were produced in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in all cases , it was found that the rate at which the phenomenon occurs depends on the existence of _ chaotic _ quantum trajectories , due to the appearance of _ quantum vortices _ ,",

    ", we explore this phenomenon in greater detail , but we also give an example of a rather surprising phenomenon , namely that quantum relaxation can be suppressed even in some cases of ensembles of chaotic rather than regular trajectories .     in a test case , where 961 particles are given initial conditions so as to represent a discrete realization of the probability @xmath16 given by eq.([eigenharm ] ) for @xmath175 .",

    "figure 7 shows first a ` test ' case , in which we compute the bohmian trajectories of 961 ( = 31@xmath18031 ) trajectories in the 2d harmonic oscillator model ( [ eigenharm ] ) , with @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen by a rejection algorithm ( see @xcite ) so as to provide a discrete sampling of an initial density distribution @xmath164 .",
    "we consider a relatively small number of particles ( of order 1000 ) because we require that their trajectories should be subsequently computed by a small ( and hence time - consuming ) timestep @xmath181 .",
    "this is needed in order to guarantee that no spurious numerical effects are introduced at least for the _ regular _ trajectories , which are our main concern here .",
    "in fact , for some trajectories we checked the results with a fixed timestep against an integration with variable time step supplemented by a regularization scheme when the distance from a nodal point becomes smaller than unity , as developed in @xcite , and found that both integrations are consistent .",

    "now , since the time evolution of the density resulting from a set of bohmian trajectories should respect the continuity equation , as we evolve the bohmian trajectories we should find this equality being preserved at all times @xmath10 .",

    "this is because our way to choose initial conditions localized in small boxes implies that the main contribution to the sum ( [ hsig ] ) comes from cells ( labeled by @xmath200 where one has @xmath201 , whence it follows that @xmath202~~.\\ ] ] we stress that , while this alternative calculation aims to approximate numerically the temporal behavior of the coarse - grained h - function , the most direct numerical test of the closeness of @xmath165 to @xmath16 is provided by the numerical value of the quantity @xmath178 .    ) .",

    "the same holds true for all its surrounding trajectories in the square . in figs.[traordcha]a , b , c it",

    "as a result , the square area formed by this grid moves coherently from one to another domain of the configuration space , without exhibiting any systematic stretching or contracting along particular directions .",
    "this behavior is due to the fact that the numerical trajectories are found to exhibit quasi - periodic oscillations with two incommensurable frequencies which are the same for all the trajectories , namely @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "in fact , this behavior is also suggested by the series solutions of perturbation theory found for smaller values of @xmath71 , and @xmath208 , which share the same property . as a result ,",

    "figures [ traordcha]d , e , f show now a similar calculation for 961 trajectories with initial conditions in the square box @xmath210 . in this case , the central trajectory ( @xmath211 ) as well as all surrounding trajectories are chaotic .",
    "we now see that the trajectories expand in a considerable domain on both sides of the x - axis , however they always reside in the _ same semi - plane _",
    "( i.e. right ) with respect to the y - axis , i.e. the orbits never cross the y - axis .",
    "the no - crossing of the y - axis is due to the central gap formed between the innermost hyperbola - like limit of the nodal lines on both sides of the y - axis ( cf .",
    "[ haordcha ] ) the presence of such limits was shown theoretically in ekc .",
    "in fact , we have integrated some representative trajectories in the same sample up to a time @xmath212 , using a precise time step ( @xmath181 ) , and no hint of crossing of the y - axis was observed for any of them .",
    "the fact that there can be chaotic trajectories limited within only a sub - domain of the total available configuration space implies that obstructions to quantum relaxation can be present even under chaotic de broglie - bohm dynamics .",
    "this is shown in fig.[relordcha ] , showing a comparison of the evolution of @xmath178 ( eq.([dendif ] ) ) for ( a ) the set of regular trajectories ( upper panels in fig.[traordcha ] ) , and ( b ) the set of chaotic trajectories ( lower panels in fig.[traordcha ] ) . in the case of regular trajectories ( fig.[relordcha]a ) , we find that @xmath178 undergoes small oscillations around a mean value @xmath213 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that ordered trajectories suppress quantum relaxation .",
    "however , the _ same _ trend is observed in the case of the chaotic trajectories , as shown in fig.[relordcha]b , since these trajectories never fill the left semi - plane @xmath214 .    in this case also",
    "the value of @xmath178 undergoes small oscillations around @xmath215 , and it does not tend to @xmath216 as @xmath10 increases .",
    "but it should be pointed out that important deviations of @xmath189 from @xmath16 are observed even if we limit ourselves to considering the sum ( [ dendif ] ) taken only on the semi - plane @xmath161 ( in this case we normalize both @xmath189 and @xmath16 so that the surface integral of both quantities over the semi - plane @xmath161 is equal to unity ) .",
    "we observe now that the new curve ( denoted by @xmath209 ) undergoes oscillations , starting from a value @xmath217 and falling at particular moments down to @xmath218 .",
    "such trend is , however , subsequently reversed , and there are many cycles of rise and fall of @xmath209 , but @xmath209 does not tend to zero .    a qualitative explanation of this behavior is provided by noting that the form of the wavefunction ( [ eigenharm ] ) allows for a recurrent transfer of quantum probability mass from the right to the left semi - plane and vice - versa .",
    "however , the considered ensemble , of only chaotic trajectories , contains no trajectories accounting for such transfer , i.e. no trajectories oscillating from one semi - plane to the other , but this transfer is only achieved in ensembles containing regular trajectories .",
    "thus , despite the fact that we have chaotic trajectories , in this example @xmath189 can not tend to @xmath16 as @xmath10 increases .",
    "we emphasize that this phenomenon occurs despite the fact that the wavefunction in the present case contains no disjoint supports . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are two or more disjoint supports of the wavefunction , if we take initial conditions in only one support , relaxation never occurs even if all the trajectories are chaotic , since such trajectories can not pass from the domain of one support to that of another at any later time @xmath10 .",
    "the examples treated in sections 2 and 5 are rather special because even the chaotic trajectories are restricted on parts only of the total available configuration space .",
    "but we can construct other examples of mixed ( i.e. co - existing regular and chaotic ) dynamics where such restriction no longer holds .",
    "one such case is provided by the wavefunction model @xcite : @xmath219\\ ] ] for @xmath220 real .",
    "below , we choose @xmath221 , @xmath222 , @xmath26 . in @xciteit was shown that this model contains both ordered and chaotic orbits .",

    "the main remark concerns the fact that , as is the case of regular orbits of the model of sections 2,3 , and 5 , the regular orbits in the present model undergo no phase mixing as well , i.e. they all do quasi - periodic oscillations with the frequencies @xmath20 and @xmath228 .",
    "furthermore , the boundary of the area occupied by the regular trajectories can not be penetrated by chaotic orbits .",

    "in fact , we notice ( fig.[rel002011]a ) that the chaotic trajectories do not penetrate the boundary ( closed gray curve ) corresponding to the set of regular trajectories , thus , while @xmath16 covers all available space , the value of @xmath231 is close to zero at all times within the domain delimited by this boundary . by calculating the percentage of the area occupied by regular orbits , versus the total area where all the orbits spread",

    "in fact , in this case , the domain occupied by regular orbits is numerically found to be larger than in the case of the wavefunction model ( [ psi002011 ] ) which is the superposition of a smaller number of states . in general",
    ", there appears to be no simple rule yielding the extent of the domain of regular orbits as the number of superposed eigenfunctions increases .    in systems like the 2d harmonic oscillator ( eq.([ham2dharm ] ) with @xmath238 rational ) , or in the case of the square box",
    "examined e.g. in @xcite , the following property can be readily shown to hold true : an arbitrary combination of any number of eigenfunctions with real amplitudes implies that all motions are periodic ( see @xcite ) . in such systems , @xmath178 and the coarse grained h - function are both periodic functions of time i.e. we have @xmath239 and @xmath240 , where @xmath241 is the period .",
    "one dimensional periodic models exhibiting the same effect were considered in @xcite .",
    "in fact , this criterion can be used as a test of the accuracy of numerical integrations , i.e. by checking the periodicity of the numerically computed functions @xmath178 or @xmath172 in a periodic model .",
    "if , now , the frequency ratio @xmath238 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham2dharm ] ) is irrational , @xmath172 has no periodic behavior .",

    "( b ) the iterates , at time @xmath263 , of a set of 961 initial conditions in a square box @xmath264 centered at @xmath265 ( regular ) remain constrained in the lower left island of stability , while the iterates of the initial conditions in a similar box around @xmath266 ( chaotic ) fill a chaotic domain .",

    "the equality of the frequencies for all regular orbits is a particular property of the de broglie - bohm dynamics in systems with a superposition of three or more eigenfunctions with a real amplitude . on the other hand , when the superposition amplitudes are complex rather than real , a novel feature may appear , namely we can construct particular combinations leading to a hamiltonian representation of the de broglie - bohm equations of motion . in such cases",
    "the regular trajectories still exhibit quasi - periodic oscillations , but the frequencies are not fixed , i.e. they are not the same for all trajectories .",
    "however , obstructions to relaxation can still be posed by the appearance of _ islands of stability _ in the configuration space .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is provided by the model considered in @xcite : @xmath267 with @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 , @xmath258 .",
    "the wavefunction ( [ wispuj ] ) corresponds to a superposition of the states @xmath268,@xmath269 and @xmath270 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham2dharm ] ) with @xmath271 . in this particular case",
    "the de broglie - bohm equations of motion are given by a time - dependent hamiltonian model @xcite , with period @xmath62 , where @xmath9 is equivalent to a momentum variable canonically conjugated to the position @xmath8 .",
    "if we plot @xmath47 along particular trajectories at the period multiples @xmath272 , we obtain stroboscopic surfaces of section presenting typical features of a hamiltonian system with mixed phase space . in fig.[wispujrel]a",
    "we see this structure , which consists of the co - existence of several islands of stability surrounded by an intricate structure and chaotic layers .",
    "the key remark regarding relaxation is that the regular orbits can not escape from the boundaries of the islands of stability .",
    "thus , if we start with initial conditions exclusively in the domain occupied by one or more islands , the particles coarse - grained density @xmath168 always retains the value @xmath273 in the chaotic domain of the configuration space , and vice versa , i.e. initial conditions in the chaotic domain lead to @xmath273 inside the islands .",
    "this effect is shown in fig.[wispujrel]b .",
    "the consequences for relaxation are shown in fig.[wispujrel]c , where we observe that both quantities @xmath178 and @xmath179 remain far from zero for all times",
    "@xmath10 up to @xmath203 .",
    "we note that the regular trajectories inside an island ( like the large lower left island in fig.[wispujrel]a ) exhibit a local phase mixing , which leads to a uniform distribution with respect to the angles after sufficiently long time .",
    "in fact , inside an island we can define a local form of an approximate integral of motion @xmath274 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. a formal series in @xmath29 with time - dependent trigonometric coefficients , whose formal time derivative , depending on the poisson bracket with the hamiltonian @xmath170 , is given by an exponentially small estimate : @xmath275 where @xmath276^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath277 is the time evolution along the periodic orbit at the center of the island of stability ( see @xcite for a heuristic derivation of such estimates ) .",
    "this implies that , down to an exponentially small error , we can practically consider the invariant curves within an island of stability of fig.[wispujrel]a as given by the level curves of @xmath278 , for various values of the constant @xmath148 .",
    "then , it is straightforward to show that if we partition the configuration space within an island by considering a sequence of level values of the parameter @xmath148 , then , independently of how we partition the remaining configuration space , the coarse - grained h - function remains bound away from zero at all times @xmath10 .",
    "finally , we should mention the cases of _ coherent state _ wavefunctions ( see our work @xcite ) , consisting of a superposition of infinitely many eigenfunctions , which exhibit no relaxation and contain only regular trajectories .    in view of the above examples ,",
    "we conclude that order in de broglie - bohm quantum mechanics appears in a quite significant variety of contexts . on the other hand , in some other cases ( e.g.@xcite@xcite ) , using a larger number of eigenfunctions , relaxation effects were found to be complete .",
    "but in the case of exact or approximate coherent states , there can be all - time or finite - time obstructions to relaxation which , as found in @xcite persist for times exponentially long in the inverse of a parameter ( equivalent to the system s mean energy ) .",
    "the fact that such states are superpositions of infinitely many eigenfunctions shows that the number of eigenfunctions composing a particular quantum state can not be used always as a good indicator of the speed of quantum relaxation .",
    "the issue of which particular superposition states speed up or slow down the relaxation process is interesting and is left for future research .",
    "we examined the role of order in the de broglie - bohm approach to quantum mechanics , by studying the conditions for the existence of regular quantum trajectories , i.e. trajectories with a zero lyapunov characteristic number .",
