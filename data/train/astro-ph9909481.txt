    "it is generally accepted that the rate of star formation in early - type galaxies is enhanced in low - density environments ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 , de carvalho & djorgovski 1992 , guzmn et al .",

    "it results in a population - density relation : the metallic features in the spectra ( eg . mg2 ) are weaker and the balmer lines stronger in low - density regions .",
    "recently ( prugniel et al . 1999 ) we have analyzed the population - density relation in low - density environments ( isolated galaxies to poor clusters ) .",
    "we found that the early - type galaxies which are likely to contain a young sub - population are mostly found in the sparsest environments .",
    "the approach used to diagnostic this effect is to study the mg@xmath0@xmath1 and the fundamental plane ( fp ) relations . indeed , although both relations are sensitive to the dynamics and to the stellar content , departures resulting from one or the other origin will have opposite signs .",
    "one the one hand , if a galaxy is found below the mg@xmath0@xmath1 relation ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , it may have either an unusually low velocity dispersion or a high mg@xmath0 index . on the other hand ,",
    "a galaxy below the fp relation has either a low velocity dispersion or contains a young population .    .",
    "our analysis of the residuals shows that the environment has primarily a visible effect on the stellar content ( not on the dynamics ) .",
    "it is not a surprise that an enhancement of the young population is detected : a relatively small fraction of young stars is sufficient to significantly modify the broad - band colors and the line strength indices .",
    "however , the enhancement of the stellar formation should have a long term effect on the dynamics of the galaxies .",
    "this delayed star formation in early - type galaxies is mostly occurring in the central regions and hence modifies the mass balance in these galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , when we into account the stellar population effect as deduced from the residuals to the mg2-@xmath2 relation , no more environmental effect persist in the fp analysis .",
    "we can not find any dynamical evolution with this analysis .",
    "however , the fp analysis mostly diagnoses the equilibrium status of the galaxies , and this long term evolution is not expected to significantly disturb the equilibrium .",
    "however , the fp analysis is also sensitive to the details of the dynamics and of the structure ( see prugniel et al .",
    "1997 ) .    using data collected in the hypercat database , in particular the kinematic and photometric profiles",
    ", we are trying to study the systematics of these non - homologies and their relation with the environment .",
