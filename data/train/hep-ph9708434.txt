    "in relativistic plasmas , such as a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) possibly formed in relativistic heavy ion collisions or a qed plasma in a supernova explosion , and in relativistic , degenerate matter , as e.g. strange quark stars , medium effects are of great importance .",
    "for example , the originally massless or light particles of the system acquire an effective mass caused by the interactions with the other particles of the system . also screening effects due to the presence of ( color ) charges in the system ( debye screening ) prevent or at least reduce infrared singularities coming from the long range interactions in qed or qcd .",
    "these effects can be calculated from the self energy of the particles .",
    "evaluated perturbatively to lowest order at high temperature @xmath1 or density ( corresponding to a large chemical potential @xmath2 ) the effective mass and the debye mass are of the order @xmath3 or @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the coupling constant .",
    "these masses can be large compared to the bare masses , which are negligible at high temperature . the dispersion relations of the quasiparticles thus deviate from the ones of bare particles leading to important modifications of the equation of state @xcite .",
    "therefore medium effects are an essential feature of relativistic systems at finite temperature or density .",
    "so far these medium effects have mainly been studied by considering the self energies in the high temperature approximation @xcite or , equivalently , in the hard thermal loop ( htl ) limit @xcite . in this approximation",
    "the momenta of the internal particles of the self energy are assumed to be hard , i.e.  of order of the temperature or chemical potential , whereas the external momenta are soft , i.e.  of the order @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these momentum scales can be distinguished only in the weak coupling limit @xmath6 , on which the htl approximation is based .",
    "the reason for these restrictions is twofold .",
    "first this approximation allows for analytic expressions of the self energies . secondly , which is more important , the self energies calculated in this way are gauge independent guaranteeing gauge independent results for the effective masses , the dispersion relations , and the debye screening . as a matter of fact",
    ", the htl approximation builds the basis for a consistent extension of the naive perturbation theory , which suffers from infrared singularities and gauge dependent results for observables .",
    "resumming the htl self energies ( and vertices ) leads to effective green s functions , which have to be used in the case of soft external momenta ( braaten - pisarski method @xcite ) . in this way consistent results for physical quantities can be found , which are gauge independent and complete to leading order in the coupling constant . at the same time the infrared behavior",
    "is greatly improved due to the use of resummed propagators , although there might be still infrared divergences owing to the absence of a static magnetic screening in the htl self energies of the gauge bosons . for applications of this powerful method to interesting problems of the qgp",
    "we refer to ref.@xcite .    here",
    "we want to compute the self energies and dispersion relations of photons , gluons and fermions at finite temperature but zero chemical potential within the one - loop approximation abolishing the htl assumption and compare the results to the ones of the htl approximation .",
    "this will give us a hint for the validity of the weak coupling assumption , on which the htl approximation and thus the braaten - pisarski method relies .",
    "up to now there are only explicit expressions for the gluon self energy beyond the htl limit , where the next term of the high temperature expansion has been evaluated @xcite . for a complete one - loop calculation , which can be done only numerically ,",
    "there exist only integral expressions @xcite , results for certain momentum limits @xcite , or analytic expressions for zero temperature but non - zero chemical potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is instructive to have a look at quantities which vanish at leading order of the one - loop high-@xmath1 expansion . as examples we consider here the imaginary parts of the self energies above the light cone and the gauge dependence of the fermion self energy",
    "first we consider the photon self energy or polarization tensor of qed within the one - loop approximation . in the vacuum it reads ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) @xmath9 \\label{e1}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 denotes the electron propagator and @xmath11 . in order to compute @xmath12 at finite temperature",

    "the final results for the real part of the self energy are shown in fig .  1 and fig .  2 , where they are also compared to the htl results ( [ e5 ] ) .",
    "for the longitudinal component , we observe a surprisingly good agreement between the two approaches even when the htl assumption @xmath34 is not fulfilled .",
    "the transverse component , however , is more sensitive to the violation of the htl assumption . for small @xmath35 and @xmath36 the one - loop result approaches the htl limit as expected . obviously , near the light cone",

    "next we consider the dispersion relations , which are given by the poles of the effective photon propagator following from resumming the self energy .",
    "for the longitudinal mode ( plasmon ) , which is absent in the vacuum , and the transverse mode , respectively , they are determined by ^-1 & = & p^2-_l^qed(p)=0 + d_t^ * qed(p)^-1 & = & p^2-_t^qed(p)=0 .",
    "[ e9 ] as in the vicinity of the light cone the deviations of both approaches are small , the same is expected for the dispersion relations for not too large couplings .",

    "the difference to the htl result is evidently larger ( fig .  4 and fig .  5 ) .",
    "again we find that for soft momenta as well as for @xmath37 the htl limit is approached and that the transverse part is more sensitive to the overstraining of the htl assumption .",
    "in general , beyond the leading contribution of the high-@xmath1 expansion , the ( one - loop ) self energies have a non - vanishing imaginary part above the light cone , for @xmath56 . for the gluon self energies it is shown in figs .  6 and 7 . while the general requirement @xmath57 , corresponding to a positive damping rate , is fulfilled for the one - loop photon self energy , it is violated by , e.g. , the transverse gluon self energy ( in feynman gauge ) .",
    "this inconsistency indicates that extending the high-@xmath1 expansion beyond leading order requires higher - loop contributions to obtain a consistent propagator .",
    "the positive imaginary parts above the light cone thus provide a measure of the magnitude of these sub - leading terms which may be of a similar order as the imaginary htl contributions for @xmath58 .",
    "although self energies containing gluon propagators depend on the choice of the gauge , the dispersion relations are , in principle , observable and thus gauge independent . while the gauge dependent terms of the gluon self energy are ( somewhat surprisingly ) found to be of sub - leading order in the high-@xmath1 expansion and the htl - dispersion relations are thus gauge invariant , this is not the case in the one - loop approximation . postponing the question of the gauge effects to the next section , here in feynman gauge the influence of the sub - leading terms neglected in the htl - limit is considered . for the dispersion relations of the longitudinal and transverse gluons we find a decreasing gluon energy @xmath59 with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "this qualitatively resembles to the next - to - leading order behavior of the gluon mass @xcite .",
    "the deviations from the htl result are larger than in the case of photons for the same extrapolated coupling strength ( fig .",

    "14 and fig .",

    "in this work we have calculated the complete one - loop self energies for photons , gluons , and fermions ( electrons or quarks ) and compared them to their htl limits . in the case of the gauge independent one - loop photon self energy we found a good agreement between these two approaches . especially for the dispersion relations both approximations agree to a surprisingly high accuracy .",
    "as far as the real parts of the gluon and fermion self energies are concerned , the difference between the both approaches is more distinct .",
    "for momenta near the light cone , however , both approaches coincide even for hard momenta violating the htl assumption @xmath34 .",
    "this means that for the htl approximation being valid we need not to require that both @xmath36 and @xmath35 are soft , but assuming a soft @xmath95 is sufficient .",
    "this also justifies the use of the htl resummed quark propagator for soft four - momenta in the calculation of the production rate of hard photons from the qgp @xcite .",
    "for the imaginary parts there are somewhat larger differences between the complete one - loop and the htl calculation .",
    "in particular the one - loop fermion self energy shows a significant imaginary part above the light cone which may be of the same order as the real part .",
    "( the same is expected for the ( complete ) gluon self energy beyond leading htl order . ) finally we have studied the gauge dependence of the one - loop fermion self energy in the class of covariant gauges .",
    "the results found above indicate that the htl approximation , based on the weak coupling limit assumption @xmath6 or equivalently on the high temperature assumption @xmath96 , is qualitatively correct for a large momentum regime even for large values of @xmath97 or temperatures of the order @xmath35 .",
    "this gives us some confidence in the usefulness of the effective perturbation theory ( braaten - pisarski method ) , which is based on the htl resummation , for realistic values of the coupling constant @xmath98  2.5 at temperatures @xmath99  300 mev that are accessible in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "furthermore , the use of htl effective masses for describing the equation of state of a gluon gas @xcite or strange quark matter @xcite appears to be justified from the point of view that the deviation of the htl masses from the complete one - loop effective masses can be neglected in those models .",
