    "nonadiabatic transitions at avoided level crossings play an essential role in numerous dynamical phenomena in physics and chemistry .",
    "they have been studied both theoretically and experimentally in various contexts like spin - flip processes in nano - scale magnets , @xcite molecular collisions , @xcite optical systems , @xcite quantum - dot arrays , @xcite bose - einstein condensates , @xcite the control of chemical reactions , @xcite and recently in particular in quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite    the `` standard '' landau - zener ( lz ) problem describes the ideal situation in which the dynamics is restricted to two levels that are coupled by a constant tunnel matrix element and cross at a constant velocity .",
    "the quantity of primary interest is the probability that finally the system ends up in the one or the other of the two states .",
    "this classic problem was solved independently by several authors in 1932 .",
    "@xcite in quantum devices , not only the transition probability but also the nonadiabatic relative phase ( stokes phase ) between the two states is important.@xcite this phase leads to observable interference effects , for example in superconducting qubits.@xcite    in an experiment , the two - level system will be influenced by its environment , which may affect the quantum phase of the superposition , alter the effective interaction between the levels , or may cause spontaneous decay . for qubits in a solid - state environment , @xcite all these processes may occur simultaneously and hinder qubit manipulation .",
    "thus in the context of solid - state quantum information processing , a realistic study of qubit manipulation via landau - zener transitions should include the influence of environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "the environment of a quantum system can often be described as a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "@xcite in some situations , it is known that the dominant environmental effects can best be modelled as a spin bath instead,@xcite for example for molecular magnets@xcite and for josephson phase qubits @xcite at very low temperatures .    in the presence of a heat bath",
    ", the landau - zener dynamics will sensitively depend on the qubit operator to which the bath couples.@xcite ao and rammer@xcite studied the lz problem for the special case in which an ohmic heat bath couples to the same operator as the driving and derived the transition probabilities in the limit of high and of low temperatures . in the limits of very fast and very slow sweeps at zero temperature , they found that the transition probability is the same as in the absence of the heat bath , as was confirmed by numerical studies.@xcite    this zero - temperature result was recently proven to hold exactly for _ arbitrary _ landau - zener sweep speeds , as a special case of an exact expression for arbitrary qubit - bath couplings and spectral densities.@xcite very recently , pokrovsky and sun@xcite developed an interesting finite - temperature formalism valid for baths with short correlation times , in which the exact transition probabilities of ref .",
    "indeed show up in the zero - temperature limit . at sufficiently high temperatures , the qubit experiences essentially classical gaussian white noise and the landau - zener problem can be solved exactly.@xcite",
    "a qubit that undergoes a landau - zener sweep while coupled to another quantum system , is equivalent to a multi - level landau - zener problem in which two groups of levels cross .",
    "if all avoided crossings are sufficiently well separated , the dynamics consists of effectively independent transitions and one can compute the transition probabilities by transfer - matrix techniques .",
    "@xcite independent level crossings do not occur for the dissipative landau - zener problem , for which the adiabatic energy spectrum is continuous .",
    "other methods are therefore required , for example the exact summation of a perturbation series.@xcite    brundobler and elser@xcite considered a special multi - level landau - zener problem in which the system starts out in the diabatic state whose energy changes faster than that of all other diabatic levels .",
    "they conjectured that the transition probabilities are then given by an expression that only contains the velocities of the diabatic levels and off - diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "the conjecture has long known to be true for the exactly solvable demkov - osherov model , where _ one _ level crosses several parallel levels.@xcite analytical proofs of the brundobler - elser conjecture have been given recently for several multi - level crossing situations .",
    "@xcite    the physically important situation of a two - level system coupled to a heat bath corresponds to two continuous bands of diabatic levels , with the same energy - level velocities within each band .",
    "a generalization of the theorem by brundobler and elser to this case will be considered .",
    "this general formula applies to dissipative landau - zener problems for all those kinds of baths at zero temperature for which the initial qubit - plus - bath ground state is unique .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for a wide range of experiments for which these conditions are met . as one of our main results , we present a universal aspect of dissipative landau - zener transitions , independent of the precise nature of the bath .",

    "[ sec : model ] we review the standard lz formula for a two - level system and generalize it to the multi - level case ; the explicit calculations have been deferred to the appendix .",

    "to set the stage and to introduce our notation , we first review the standard landau - zener problem for an isolated qubit . by `` isolated '' we mean : not coupled to an environment but nevertheless driven by a deterministic classical field , whose physical origin will be specified and discussed in sec .",

    "nevertheless , the population of the diabatic states at @xmath14 can be calculated exactly and is determined by the landau - zener transition probability @xcite @xmath15 which denotes the probability for a _ transition _ to the opposite diabatic state , i.e.  the probability to _ stay _ in the adiabatic eigenstate .",
    "accordingly , @xmath16 denotes the probability for a non - adiabatic transition , i.e.  a jump across the avoided crossing .",

    "then at very large times @xmath27 , the qubit hamiltonian is dominated by the time - dependent part , so that all states of the system - plus - environment belong to one of two bands : an `` up - cluster '' @xmath28 and a `` down - cluster '' @xmath29 , with energies moving upwards and downwards , respectively .      the dissipative landau - zener problem is a scattering problem in the restricted sense that changes in the qubit s state will occur only during a finite time interval around @xmath6 .",
    "in order to exploit this fact that the qubit will not flip for sufficiently large @xmath30 , we decompose @xmath31 into its diabatic states .",
    "these are the eigenstates of the total hamiltonian in the the limits @xmath27 .",
    "initially and finally , the hamiltonian is dominated by the term proportional to @xmath32 , so that the diabatic basis for the qubit is simply given by the states @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    for the environment , by contrast , there is no corresponding growing energy scale for large @xmath30 .",
    "its diabatic states are influenced by the coupling to the qubit and depend on the qubit s state .",

    "we now split the hamiltonian into two parts , one that is diagonal in the spin index , while the other is off - diagonal .",
    "the former part consists of all terms proportional to @xmath49 and is diagonal in the diabatic basis .",
    "the latter part reads @xmath50 and will be called the _ bit - flip interaction _ , since it contains all interaction terms of the hamiltonian that induce a change in the state of the qubit .",
    "an important feature of the diabatic basis is that all matrix elements of @xmath51 vanish within each cluster , i.e. @xmath52 this relation will be essential for the application of the general formula for the nonadiabatic transition probabilities as derived in appendix [ app : begen ] .",
    "we have now achieved a useful formulation of the dissipative landau - zener problem in terms of two groups of diabatic states .",
    "if the group of upward moving parallel levels would consist of merely one state , then transition probabilities could be computed with the simple independent - crossing formula , for which brundobler and elser@xcite conjectured that it holds even when successive level crossings are not independent .",

    "the second line of eq .   asserts that states of the `` up - cluster '' that lie above the initial state will finally be unpopulated .",
    "this no - go theorem was formulated in refs .   and , and we think that it is more aptly described by the name `` no - go - up theorem '' .",
    "a case of particular interest is that of the initial state @xmath56 , which is the ground state of the entire system . for all bath models employed below",

    "this way , the lz sweep provides a test of the settings of the quantum computer in the operational space of the qubit .",
    "on the other hand , our predictions can be tested very carefully by controlled variation of qubit - qubit interactions in the quantum computer .",
    "indeed , the quantum computer could be seen as a quantum simulator , in our case of the effects of a spin bath on the lz transition probability .",

    "our assumption of a spin - star configuration , i.e. a bath of mutually non - interacting spins , is probably correct for the spin bath of the phase qubits.@xcite monte - carlo simulations indicate that narrower qubit - spin resonances are shadowed by larger ones.@xcite for that reason it is important that formula   holds generally , whether the qubit resonantly interacts with one microwave resonator at a time or not .    during a so - called fast - pulse measurement of the state of the qubit ,",
    "the qubit energy moves in and out of resonance with many of these resonators.@xcite as a consequence , the resonators reduce the fidelity of the measurement .",

    "more good news is that the same fidelity reduction would be obtained even if there would be additional dephasing by the spins .",
    "landau - zener sweeps for phase qubits can be relevant for one more reason:@xcite the precise spectral distribution of the spins will be sample dependent . moreover , the distribution for a single sample varies on a time scale of days.@xcite fortunately , the lz sweep measures a `` global '' property of the spin bath , namely its integrated spectral density @xmath96 .",
    "it is fair to assume that @xmath96 will vary less from sample to sample and from one day to the next than @xmath98 at a fixed frequency .",

    "however , when the qubit - bath coupling is of the diagonal type , causing so - called pure dephasing , then the tunneling probability coincides with the original lz probability , regardless of the details of the environment .",
    "we expect that this universal behavior is observable and important for a wide variety of applications .",
    "a bath - independence of another kind was found for a qubit swept past a broadened ( circuit ) cavity resonance : the transition probability turned out to be independent of the quality factor of the cavity .",

    "<S> we study landau - zener transitions in a qubit coupled to a bath at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> a general formula is derived that is applicable to models with a non - degenerate ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate exact transition probabilities for a qubit coupled to either a bosonic or a spin bath . the nature of the baths and the qubit - bath coupling is reflected in the transition probabilities . for diagonal coupling , when the bath causes energy fluctuations of the diabatic qubit states but no transitions between them , the transition probability coincides with the standard lz probability of an isolated qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this result is universal as it does not depend on the specific type of bath . for pure off - diagonal coupling , by contrast , the tunneling probability is sensitive to the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance of our results for experiments on molecular nanomagnets , in circuit qed , and for the fast - pulse readout of superconducting phase qubits . </S>"
