    "a major step forward in research on the top quark has recently been achieved by the cdf collaboration@xcite and the d0 collaboration@xcite . both groups present evidence for the discovery of the heaviest quark .",
    "previously cdf@xcite published some of the data on a number of top - antitop production and decay events @xcite .",
    "these data consist of seven single lepton events with four large @xmath7 jets ( @xmath8 ) and two opposite - sign dilepton events with two large @xmath7 jets ( @xmath9 ) and must be regarded as due to initial - state inner - bremsstrahlung . in both events",
    "the third jet happens to be associated with the antiproton ( see table i ) . ] .",
    "each of the former has one jet `` tagged '' as a likely @xmath10 or @xmath11 jet and passes the many different cuts designed to minimize the contribution from the extensive background @xcite expected from `` w + jets '' standard model processes .",
    "the dilepton events are fewer , since hadronic decays predominate over leptonic decays for the w - boson ; indeed , for 7 b - tagged @xmath8 events , @xcite . ]",
    "we would expect @xcite about @xmath12 events , compatible with observation .",
    "the cdf analysis of the @xmath8 events follows established procedures from bubble chamber physics , except that energy measurements by calorimeter have much less percentage error than momentum measurements by magnetic fields .",
    "the cdf analysis of the @xmath9 events is only kinematical , based on whether the measured momenta satisfy a set of cuts deemed sufficient to remove all background .",
    "the formula for this rate as a function of top mass @xmath13 is then used to deduce a lower limit on @xmath13 .",
    "this procedure gives no weight to precise detailed features of the event and their relative probabilities , given our knowledge of the quark structure of protons and of the electroweak decay amplitudes characteristic of the standard model , so well confirmed elsewhere today .",
    "it appears worthwhile at present to make independent calculations from these and other data @xcite by methods we have already described , as a contribution to the phenomenology of top quarks .",
    "this may also help us to assess the relative benefits of the various methods which have been proposed .",
    "further , there are now four @xmath9 events available for analyses , and it will be valuable to compare the top mass estimates from them with those from the @xmath8 events . that the two groups of top mass estimates should be in agreement is a powerful test of the methods now being used for top mass determinations .",
    "over several years , we @xcite and k.  kondo , _ et.al . _ @xcite , independently , have developed a method for determining whether events of the type reported by the cdf and d0 collaborations are consistent with the hypothesis @xmath15 followed by @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 the procedure is to take the measured configuration of momenta for the final leptons and jets in a single event and to evaluate the probability @xmath20 that these production and decay processes could produce the observed configuration for an assumed value of the top quark mass .",
    "this evaluation takes into account each step in the processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : the parton content of the incoming proton and antiproton ; the differential cross section for these partons @xmath21 and @xmath22 to produce the @xmath23 pair ; the decay probability for the top and antitop quarks to undergo the processes  [ twb ] and  [ tbarwb ] respectively , with the angles observed in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 rest frames ; and the probabilities for the w bosons to decay into the leptons or quark pairs as observed , retaining the spin and tensor polarization the w bosons have following @xmath24 or @xmath25 decay .",
    "we applied this procedure to the published dilepton event ( which we refer to as cdf-1 ) from the 1988 - 89 run by cdf@xcite .",
    "the primary muon from this event did not go through the muon detector which was in place for that first run , but its muonic character was made quite clear by the evidence from its passage through an adjacent calorimeter . since one of the acceptance criteria in that run was that the muon should identify itself by passing through the muon detector , cdf has rejected this event . to avoid such rejection in subsequent runs ,",
    "cdf has elongated their muon detector , so that an event with the same configuration as cdf-1 would be accepted today .",
    "this rejection is undoubtedly sound practice when one is concerned with cross sections and relative rates , but our only concern here is whether or not this event is a satisfactory candidate for interpretation as an example of top- antitop production and decay .",
    "our analysis of this event led to a somewhat low mass value , either @xmath26 or @xmath27 , depending on the details of the treatment of the transverse momentum distribution of the parton - antiparton pair which generates the final @xmath28 state .",
    "a similar calculation has been made independently by kondo et al.@xcite , leading to a mass distribution @xmath20 almost identical with our distribution with a peak at @xmath29 .",
    "the d0 collaboration applied three modified versions of our method to their @xmath30 candidate and obtained a probability distribution which peaks at @xmath31 , with half - maximum values at about @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the input data for this event are not known to us .",
    "the d0 detector does not have the capability to measure the charge sign for @xmath34 but the charge sign for the muon can , in principle , be determined by the magnetic field in the muon detector .",
    "the momentum data for the two @xmath35 events observed by cdf@xcite in their 1992 - 93 run , mentioned above , are given here in table 1 in terms of cartesian momenta .",
    "we have analysed these two events by the same procedure as we used@xcite for the cdf-1 event . in both cases jet 3",
    "is neglected for the reason given in footnote 1 .",
    "we assigned uncertainties to the jet transverse energies by an algorithm based on the @xmath36 values presented by cdf for all their different energy jets , in the single lepton @xmath28 events was used .",
    "this underestimates the uncertainties for some of the low energy jets . ] .",
    "a jet is paired with a lepton to determine a paraboloid of possible top momenta .",
    "the second jet is paired with the other lepton to form the paraboloid for the anti - top momenta .",
    "assuming that the @xmath28 production occurs with small total transverse momentum , the transverse momentum of the top quark ( for a definite mass value @xmath13 ) should nearly cancel the corresponding transverse momentum of the anti - top quark with the same mass @xmath13 . to allow for gluon bremsstrahlung",
    ", we took a gaussian distribution of values centered on zero , with a representative width of @xmath37 , to weight the probability of the pair of transverse momenta assigned to the @xmath24 and @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the resulting probability distributions are shown on fig .",
    "1 . in both cases , the assignment of jets to the @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks",
    "is uniquely determined by this mass analysis .",
    "it happens that for event 41722/38382 , jets 1 and 2 are necessarily @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , and the same holds for event 41540/127085 .",
    "the latter also has a secondary ( slow ) @xmath4 lepton , which would routinely be assigned to the @xmath11 jet , here jet 2 .",
    "we discuss , in the appendix , the possible interpretation for this additional lepton .",
    "the probability distributions @xmath20 from these two new cdf events , shown in fig . 1 , peak at @xmath38 for 41540/127085 and at @xmath39 for 47122/38382 .",
    "these independent probability distributions are consistent with the production of top quarks with @xmath38 , as seen in fig .",
    "2 , where the two have been multiplied .",
    "the mass distributions for the cdf-1 and d0 events are appreciably lower in peak mass , but each has a very gradual fall- off for higher mass values .",
    "the joint probability for all four dilepton events is displayed in fig .",
    "it peaks at @xmath40 , since event 41540/127085 gives the narrowest distribution .",
    "this event also has the lowest likelihood ; indeed , if @xmath41 , the transverse momentum weighting parameter in eq.(3.21 ) of ref.@xcite , is reduced from our adopted value of @xmath42 down to zero , the solution for this event ceases to exist .",
    "however , as things are , this joint probability @xmath20 has a convincing shape , although its absolute likelihood is very low .",
    "it is still quite possible that not all of these events , or even any of them , are due to top - antitop production and decay .",
    "more candidate @xmath43 events are needed for study before we can conclude which of these events constitute a group of top - antitop events for a definite mass @xmath13 . as already discussed @xcite , there are non - top sources of background possible which may mimic real top - antitop events .",
    "we now consider the single lepton events , with at least 4 jets , one of which is tagged as @xmath10 or @xmath11 quark .",
    "the momenta of the leptons and jets in the seven published events are given in cartesian co - ordinates in table 2 .",
    "the jet calorimeter energies are the `` corrected values '' quoted by cdf@xcite in their appendix a , following the calculated scatter plots given in their fig .",
    "57 ; they are the cdf estimates for the original parton energies , with well - defined statistical uncertainties .",
    "energy for the two jets hypothesized to result from w decay is generally rather far from the well - known value@xcite @xmath45 , and this presents a problem .",
    "cdf uses a kinematic fitting procedure , established long ago@xcite in bubble chamber work , to manipulate the already corrected transverse energies in order to reproduce the w mass value at the expense of a higher @xmath46 .",
    "we do not use the resulting `` best fit values '' given by cdf , since we follow a different scheme of analysis@xcite .",
    "our analysis of these @xmath8 events employs a simple extension of the method used above for dilepton events , which has been laid out in considerable detail in ref .",
    "we sketch it briefly here , for the case of a positively charged lepton @xmath47 ; the case for @xmath48 follows when every particle is replaced by its antiparticle and vice versa .",
    "one jet is chosen tentatively to be the @xmath49 jet associated with @xmath47 and a kinematic paraboloid is formed , as before , leading to an ellipse in momentum space which includes all momenta @xmath50 consistent with @xmath51 and @xmath52 , for an assumed mass @xmath13 .",
    "the other three jets are assumed to arise from @xmath25 decay where the resulting @xmath53 boson decays hadronically , thus : @xmath54 the quark assumed to be @xmath11 will be denoted@xmath55 by @xmath56 .",
    "the experimental error distributions for these quark energies have been discussed in much detail by cdf@xcite and we adopt the same algorithm that interpolates their @xmath36 values as stated in footnote 3 .",
    "a grid of momentum values @xmath57 is laid out and weighted by their probability values at each point , together with a probability weighting @xmath58 of breit - wigner form to emphasize those grid points at which ( @xmath59 is consistent with the w - boson mass . at each grid point",
    ", there is a definite momentum ( @xmath60 and deduced mass @xmath13 , and this point is then paired with the points on the t- ellipse for @xmath13 , which also have their weighting factors due to measurement errors .",
    "this product of probabilities is finally weighted by a gaussian factor @xmath61 $ ] to represent the effect of limited transverse momentum due to initial state gluon emission , the value @xmath42 being adopted for the parameter @xmath41 .",
    "contributions to the net probability for the top quark mass to lie within @xmath62 come from all grid points which lie within this band @xmath63 , and are summed to give the net probability @xmath20 indicated by this event .",
    "this probability has been computed for a definite assignment @xmath64 of the four jets .",
    "if none of the jets is b - tagged , then for an individual event distribution , we will still have to sum over all permutations of the jet assignments .",
    "if one jet is b - tagged by svx , we shall generally not know whether is is a @xmath10-jet or a @xmath11-jet , and we shall then have to sum over the two possible assignments for a jet which may be due to @xmath10 or to @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to note that each jet is treated in an identical way , so that relative probability between different events and different interpretations can be compared .",
    "the probability distributions obtained in this way for each of the seven @xmath8 events are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in most , but not all , of the events ,",
    "the combination of jets which has the largest integrated probability is the assignment chosen by cdf s method@xcite .",
    "however , two exceptions to this observation will be mentioned below .",
    "the product of the independent probabilities for these seven @xmath8 events is plotted in fig .",
    "2 . their net distribution peaks at @xmath65 , in accord with the cdf group s conclusion for the same seven events .    how should we assess the significance of the integrated probability found for each of these events ?",
    "they range from a maximum of roughly @xmath66 for event 45880/31838 down to @xmath67 for event 43351/266423 .",
    "to address this question of significance , we have carried out the same analysis procedure for a random sample of computer - generated events , a monte- carlo simulation based on tree - level qcd feynman graphs for top - antitop production , followed by their decay into the final states @xmath8 . in this way",
    ", we generated 100,000 events for mass @xmath69 , of which 38,394 passed all of the appropriate experimental cuts .",
    "each event requires the specification of eleven variables , each arranged to vary over a finite range , and this finite 11-dimensional space was divided into a finite number of cells@xcite .",
    "the procedure is iterative , based on a program by ohnemus@xcite .",
    "each event had a weight , its fractional contribution to the total cross section .",
    "the first 20,000 events , randomly generated , led to a net weight in each cell , and a new set of variables were chosen , leading to a new set of cells , each with about the same net weight .",
    "this procedure was iterated five times , for each new set of 20,000 randomly - generated events . the distribution of the final 20,000 events in the 11-dimensional space is then expected to be much closer to the physical reality corresponding to this simple tree - level model , than that of the first 20,000 events .",
    "the improvement in each iteration can be tested , for example by comparing the total cross section calculated after each iteration with the directly calculated total cross section for this simple model , as given by berends _ et.al._@xcite .",
    "the weights are finally used to choose randomly a set of unweighted events to form a representative subsample@xcite .",
    "the subsample we can analyse is necessary small , of order 100 , since our analysis procedure is quite complicated and needs very considerable computer time . in the end , we chose a subsample of 105 events randomly , by the procedure just mentioned above , out of the 1,292 events which passed the experimental cuts , from the first 3,000 events of the last iteration .",
    "our purpose is to compare the observed features of the candidate top - antitop events with the features predicted for these events by this simple qcd model .    since these are mc events , we know which quarks are which .",
    "in analyzing each event , typical measurement errors are assumed for the lepton and the jets .",
    "we then use our analysis method to deduce the probability distribution @xmath20 from the event .",
    "the integrated probabilities , @xmath70 , and the @xmath13 values for the peak in the probability @xmath20 are shown in the `` scatter plot '' of fig.4 .",
    "this shows that the analysis does reproduce the input mass rather well , but that there is a wide range in the ip values .",
    "we have plotted the distribution obtained for these ip values in fig.5 , and note that they have a rather wide range .",
    "however , this exercise has given us some criterion for recognizing poor fits , when we come to consider the analysis of real events , and this was its purpose .",
    "our analyses of the seven empirical events are summarized in table 3 . since these are tagged events , the tagged jet is likely to be either a @xmath10 or @xmath11 jet associated with the @xmath71 that decayed either leptonically ( the @xmath49 jet ) or hadronically ( the @xmath56 jet ) . for a given event , each assignment of jets to the @xmath72 hypothesis in eqn([wqq ] ) is analyzed independently , i.e. each particular choice of jets to correspond to the configuration @xmath73 , is analyzed separately .",
    "cdf has done such separate analyses as well .",
    "they assign the measured jets and the lepton to a configuration and determine the @xmath46 per degree of freedom ( there are 18 measurements - momenta , energies and angles , with 20 constraints ) that that configuration satisfies the @xmath74 hypothesis , based only on the jets kinematics , without weighting by the probabilities for such kinematics .",
    "all but two of the seven events give integrated probabilities between @xmath75 and @xmath76 , significantly lower ( by a factor about 1/5 ) than the majority of our monte carlo sample .",
    "two of these events , 45880/31838 and 45879/123158 , have two maxima peaking above @xmath77 ; the former gives @xmath78 with @xmath79 for configuration @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 for @xmath83 , and the latter giving @xmath84 with @xmath85 for @xmath86 and @xmath87 with @xmath88 for @xmath83 .",
    "cdf s fit to the latter is for configuration @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 ; we do have a fit in this configuration with peak at @xmath92 , but it has a low integrated probability , @xmath93 . the events 43090/47223 and 43351/266423 also give much lower integrated probabilities , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , and we are inclined to reject them as top candidates .",
    "the latter is a poor fit also in cdf s analysis , but cdf found the former to be acceptable .",
    "on the other hand , event 45610/139604 gives integrated probability @xmath96 with @xmath88 in our analysis ; the cdf analysis also found @xmath97 but a poor @xmath98 . .",
    "we may summarize our considerations as follows :    \\1 ) our analysis of the seven @xmath8 events now known is in general accord with the cdf - analysis , especially with their mass estimate of about @xmath99 .",
    "two of the events have very low likelihoods in our analysis , while two of them have relatively large @xmath46 in the cdf analysis , one event being rejected by both ; four events stand firm in both analyses .",
    "the three events rejected may be due to background such as that originating from the processes @xmath100 with @xmath101 , as discussed by berends , @xmath102 @xcite , although those authors show that tagging a single @xmath103 quark should significantly reduce that background .",
    "their calculations indicate a suppression by about @xmath104 when both @xmath10 and @xmath11 are tagged .",
    "more estimates from other mechanisms involving b - quarks need to be considered quantitatively , within the framework of our analysis procedure .",
    "\\(ii ) the relative rate between @xmath105 and @xmath106 events must be considered . accepting that four b - tagged events of the former class have been observed , we need to calculate the expected number of events of the latter class . this is a complicated calculation , which is sensitive to the precise cuts which are imposed and which we do not attempt to carry out here .",
    "the efficiencies depend on whether the lepton in question is an electron or a muon .",
    "the nature of the identification given by tagging is different for svx and slt .",
    "svx does not distinguish @xmath10 from @xmath11 , since it determines only the location of the secondary vertex , while slt does not give the location of the vertex but does distinguish between @xmath10 and @xmath11 . since the c - quark decay lifetime is shorter than that for the b - quark , there should frequently be seen a tertiary vertex arising from c decay , not far from a secondary b- vertex .",
    "\\iii ) finally , the peak mass @xmath13 appears to be systematically somewhat lower for @xmath106 events than for @xmath105 events , the former being @xmath107 , and the latter being @xmath108 , a separation of @xmath109 , although this is still a tolerable difference .",
    "we repeat that it is far from sure that all of the latter events are due to @xmath110 production and decay .",
    "however , to strengthen the lower mass value for the former , we can also consider the cdf event 45047/104393 , which has a more natural identification with the dilepton variety .",
    "assigning both leptons as `` hard '' , rather than taking one as `` soft '' , and combining two jets into a single jet , leads to a good fit as a @xmath28 event with @xmath111 , consistent with the generally lower masses for the dilepton candidates .",
    "the authors are grateful to j. ohnemus for supplying a copy of an efficient monte carlo code with importance sampling and to p. sphicas , tony smith , k. kondo , and d0 group members for many useful conversations .",

    "we appreciate the hospitality of prof .",
    "d. sherrington at the department of theoretical physics , oxford .",
    "the cdf dilepton event 41540/127085 has a unique interpretation when analysed as @xmath112 , @xmath113 being identified as the @xmath10-jet and @xmath114 as the @xmath11-jet ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the jet @xmath115 is close to the initial direction , being most probably due to gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "the event has a third lepton , a `` slow '' @xmath116 of energy @xmath117 .",
    "the routine choice of associating this lepton with the @xmath11 jet is not convincing since its largest momentum component , @xmath118 , is oppositely directed to the largest component of the jet 2 momentum , @xmath119 .",
    "it is much more plausible that the slow @xmath116 is associated with jet 1 , since its momentum is almost parallel with the momentum of jet 1 , and in the same direction ; its momentum @xmath120 , transverse to jet 1 is only about @xmath121 .    the sequence of quark processes which lead to the emission of a tertiary @xmath116 lepton , ( a ) with , and ( b ) without , a secondary @xmath122 lepton , are as follows : @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 the w s in ( [ 3b ] ) , ( [ 3c ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) being necessarily virtual , of course . the net process for the event 41540/127085 would be the consequence of ( [ 3a]),([3c ] ) and ( [ 3d ] ) , thus : @xmath127    to orient ourselves concerning the final states , we have made some simple model calculations for the momentum distributions for a secondary lepton @xmath128 , or for a tertiary lepton @xmath129 , appropriate for an initial @xmath130jet with momentum about @xmath131 .",

    "_ et.al.__@xcite , with the parameter @xmath132 , where @xmath133 denotes the appropriate heavy quark mass . in the first step",
    ", the @xmath10-quark generally undergoes hadronization to a final ground state meson @xmath134 , @xmath135 or @xmath136 with spin - parity @xmath137 , together with some number of light mesons ; we neglect explicit mention of hadronization to @xmath138 baryons , since such final states contribute much less and do not affect the over - all conclusions . using the standard model expression for the momentum distribution of the lepton resulting from @xmath139 in the b - meson rest frame",
    ", we obtain the @xmath140 momentum distribution in the lab frame by integrating this distribution over the b - momentum distribution given by the fragmentation function . the resulting energy distribution for secondary leptons",
    "is given in fig.6(a ) .",
    "we note that these energies run up to very large values .",
    "the mean @xmath140 energy is @xmath141 and @xmath142 of the leptons have energy greater than @xmath143 .",
    "the distribution for @xmath144 , the secondary muon momentum transverse to the b - momentum , is given in fig.7(a ) , although we must note that the b - momentum is affected by the gluons and light mesons emitted so that it differs a little from the @xmath130jet axis observed .",
    "the most probable value for @xmath145 is @xmath146 ; its median value is @xmath147 . for @xmath148 of the secondary leptons ,",
    "@xmath145 exceeds @xmath121 ; @xmath149 of them have @xmath150 . for tertiary leptons",
    ", we must first carry out the same calculation for the lab momentum distribution of the c - quarks from the b - jet .",
    "naturally , this distribution is quite different from that for the secondary leptons , because of the large mass value for the c - quark .",
    "the lab energy distribution for the @xmath151 lepton from @xmath152 decay is then obtained by integrating the latter , as given by the standard model , over the fragmentation function for the ground state @xmath137 ( @xmath153)-mesons from the c - jet distribution just calculated .",
    "the resulting energy distribution for the @xmath151 lepton is shown in fig.6(b ) .",
    "we note that these energies are much less than those for secondary leptons but their distribution is very asymmetric ; their peak value is @xmath154 , while their median value is @xmath155 . above @xmath156 ,",
    "the distribution falls gradually with increasing energy @xmath157 , by a factor of 3 from 5 to 15 gev , and then faster beyond ; @xmath158 of the tertiary leptons have @xmath159 , but only @xmath160 have energies exceeding @xmath161 .",
    "the distribution for the transverse momentum @xmath162 is shown on fig.7(b ) .",
    "it peaks at @xmath163 and is a little asymmetric ; about @xmath164 of the events have @xmath165 , about @xmath166 have @xmath167 .",
    "we now return to the consideration of event cdf-41540/127085 . that the `` slow '' @xmath4 lepton is associated with jet 1 is supported by a close examination of the event shown in fig.10 and table vii of the cdf paper @xcite .",
    "there is a displaced vertex shown in the svx detector , at @xmath168 from the origin of the event .",
    "comparison of the @xmath169 distribution in their fig.10(b ) with the entry in their table vii shows us that the secondary vertex shown is associated with the b - jet ( jet 1 ) .",
    "we are not told where the @xmath170 @xmath116 emerged .",
    "the two most immediate possibilities are :    ( t@xmath171 ) the displaced vertex is a non - leptonic b - decay , the ratio @xmath172 being 0.26 , where @xmath173 is the mean distance of travel by the b - quark before decay , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 being the b - meson lifetime .",
    "the resulting c - quark then undergoes decay @xmath176 , leading to a `` slow '' @xmath116 which is tertiary .",
    "the chance that this c - decay occurs outside the svx region is about @xmath177 where @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "taking @xmath180 to have value about the same as @xmath181 , we then have @xmath182 about @xmath183 , which gives the chance of the c - quark escaping without detection to be about @xmath184 .",
    "( t@xmath185 ) the vertex observed is a tertiary decay , the slow @xmath116 being one of the tracks observed ( whether or not it is identified ) and coming from the transition @xmath186 .",
    "the only question is `` where is the b - quark decay vertex ? '' to give rise to what is observed , there should then be a b non - leptonic vertex between the origin and the displaced vertex , but perhaps so close to the tertiary vertex , in view of the rapidity of c - decay relative to b - decay , that it may be difficult to separate the two vertices .",
    "also , in this case , there should necessarily be a @xmath116 emitted from the displaced vertex , although there is no clear record of this @xmath116 in the svx data .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the probability for this outcome , without more detailed information .",
    "a much closer examination of the svx data on this event is needed .",
    "such tertiary leptons will not be rare . the branching fraction ( bf ) for all leptonic modes",
    "is known @xcite to be about @xmath187 for the b quark and about @xmath188 , on average , for the c quark mesons , the bf s are @xmath189 for @xmath190 and @xmath191 for @xmath192 . from their known lifetimes",
    "their leptonic decay rates are therefore @xmath193 and @xmath194 , respectively , in fair agreement with each other . the well known inequality between their total decay rates ( and therefore between their leptonic bf s ) is due to a suppression of the non - leptonic decay modes of @xmath190 relative to those for the @xmath192 .",
    "however , it is leptonic bf s which are relevant for discussing the possibilities for tertiary leptons .",
    "the leptonic bf s are not known for @xmath195 , only the upper limit , @xmath196 , but its total lifetime is within three standard deviations of that for @xmath192 . ] , assuming that the configurations @xmath197 are produced equally often . neglecting corrections for the efficiencies for detecting slt s ,",
    "generally stated to be about @xmath164 but which may be substantially lower than this for the detection of tertiary leptons , we may estimate that the frequency of tertiary leptons without any secondary lepton is comparable with the frequency of secondary leptons without any tertiary lepton .",
    "( s@xmath198 or s@xmath199 ) the hadronization of the b - jet may lead to a charged @xmath200 meson or to a neutral meson , @xmath201 or @xmath202 .",
    "in the latter two cases , the meson may undergo the process of @xmath203 mixing or @xmath204 mixing , and can then emit a @xmath116 lepton from the secondary process @xmath205 , then possible from the @xmath11-quark in the @xmath206 or @xmath207 components of the final mixed ( @xmath208)-meson state . from data on b - jet development following the much studied process @xmath209",
    ", it is known that the secondary @xmath116 s from this source have an intensity @xmath210 of the total from the secondary ( @xmath211 ) leptons from the initial b - quark .",
    "these secondary @xmath116 s from mixing will have the same energy spectrum as the @xmath212 secondary leptons from all three kinds of final b - meson , which we have estimated from our model calculation to have the form shown in fig.6(a ) , a spectrum much harder than our estimate for the tertiary @xmath4 spectrum , given in fig.6(b ) .",
    "as noted above , it is known @xcite that the rate for @xmath47 is @xmath215 times that for ( @xmath216 ) when the sum is over @xmath135 and @xmath136 mesons .",
    "we denote the distribution of the final secondary lepton by @xmath217 , shown in fig.6(a ) , and the distribution of the secondary lepton momentum transverse to the b - jet axis by @xmath218 , shown in fig.7(a ) . from ref.@xcite",
    ", we take @xmath219 for the branching fraction @xmath220 .",
    "the net rate for @xmath47 , occuring as secondary leptons , is given by @xmath221 per inital b quark .",
    "here we ignore the svx detector , i.e. we do not require the second decay to be visible within it . from ref.@xcite ,",
    "we take @xmath223 as the branching fraction ( @xmath224 . the net rate for @xmath47 is now , @xmath225 per initial b quark .    for the event of interest",
    ", we have @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the interpretation s that the `` slow '' @xmath4 lepton is due to ( @xmath208 ) mixing gives the rate per initial b quark as @xmath228 with the tertiary interpretation t , we have the rate @xmath229    hence the calculations with our simple model for the decay sequences @xmath230 and @xmath231 indicate that the likelihood that this @xmath4 is tertiary relative to the likelihood that it is secondary - but results from ( @xmath208 ) mixing - is 25:1 .",
    "the main factor depressing the rate @xmath232 is the low value for @xmath233 ; surprisingly , the observed values for @xmath234 and @xmath235 do not distinguish clearly between the possibilities s and t.    it is of interest to compare event 41540/127085 with those slt @xmath236 events reported by cdf , which can be assigned uniquely and kinematically to secondary lepton emission .",
    "these are the events where the lepton charge has sign in accord with the decay @xmath237 ( or @xmath238 , for events which stem from @xmath25 production and decay ) .",
    "we note that the primary lepton energies @xmath239 have a reasonable spread of energies , from @xmath240 to @xmath241 , as shown in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the two energies @xmath239 in the dilepton events lie at energies in the range @xmath242 .",
    "the four `` slow '' leptons available have energies @xmath243 whcih range from @xmath244 to @xmath245 , while the @xmath4 energy in event 41540/127085 lies in the middle of this range .",
    "the same holds for its @xmath235 value .",
    "since the b - jet energy in this event has a surprisinglly large value , ( @xmath246 ) being @xmath247 ( overlooking the unknown neutrino energy resulting from this b - decay ) , we might look instead at the weighted energies @xmath248 and transverse momenta @xmath249 , listed in table 4 .",
    "even then , their values for 41540/127085 still lie within the ranges obtained for these parameters from the four @xmath236 events .",
    "none of these numbers mark out this slt event as being obviously different from the other slt events , except for the charge sign for the `` slow '' @xmath4 and the magnitude of the ratio @xmath250 discussed above .",
    "finally , we must compare these four slt @xmath236 events with the calculated spectra for our simple ( @xmath251 ) model .",
    "figure 6a shows that the median value predicted for secondary lepton energy @xmath243 lies at @xmath252 for the dilepton event 41540/127085 , with @xmath253 for jet 1 lab energy @xmath254 .",
    "the four slt events have lower b - jet energies , ranging from @xmath255 to @xmath256 .",
    "this does not effect the @xmath235 spectrum , but it alters the @xmath243 spectra .",
    "for each event the energy spectrum will depend on the boost from the decaying b rest frame to the lab frame ( in which the b meson is a fragment of the b - jet ) .",
    "for the event with the lowest associated b - jet energy , event 43351 , the corresponding spectrum will have a median of about @xmath257 , compared to the measured @xmath258 .",
    "the median energy grows roughly linearly with jet energy , so the secondary lepton in each of these four events have generally lower energy , @xmath243 , than the predicted median .",
    "three of these slt events have @xmath235 values that lie below @xmath259 , whereas our model predicts its median to be @xmath260 .",
    "the accord of these data with our calculations is neither striking nor unfavourable .",
    "it may be that the cuts made on the data by the experimenters , aimed at picking out any background events , have a much larger effect on the predicted curves in figs.6 and 7 than we have anticipated .",
    "double - tagging , the combination of the secondary vertex detector ( svx ) and the obsevation of secondary leptons ( slt ) together should provide a powerful means for interpretation of the nature of individual events , without a full dynamical analysis ( which would at best be possible only rarely ) .",
    "the above analysis of event 41540/127085 illustrates this point quite strongly .",
