    "<S> , spin chains can greatly facilitate large - scale quantum information processing .    while many different realizations of the coherent spin transistor may be possible , here we focus one such realization in a small ensemble of strongly - interacting cold atoms trapped in a tight one - dimensional potential of appropriate shape . </S>",

    "<S> our scheme thus realizes a quantum logic operation and it can be used to obtain spatially entangled states of target and control spins , as well as to create schrdinger cat states for a large number of target spins . </S>"
