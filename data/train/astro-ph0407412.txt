    "spiral structure is an astounding characteristic of disk galaxies . yet",
    ", the nature of the spiral structure of our home galaxy is far from well understood .",
    "the generally accepted model , originally discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , involves a density wave resulting from a global gravitational mode , triggered either by a internal instability or some driving element ( like a bar or an interacting external galaxy ) .",
    "another proposed model describes the spiral structure as a self - propagating wave of enhanced star formation @xcite . in either case , the models show the importance of the gaseous disk in the global spiral structure phenomenon .    the role of the gas in the spiral structure has been exploited repeatedly in order to trace the spiral arms , both in the milky way and in external galaxies .",
    "those efforts have included @xcite , co clouds @xcite and dust @xcite as tracers .",
    "since the spiral arms show an enhanced star formation rate , pop i objects can also be used as tracers . the model presented by @xcite , which featured a four - arm spiral traced by galactic regions ,",
    "is frequently cited .",
    "nevertheless , it is not unusual to observe differences in the spiral structure when different tracers are used .",
    "one example is ngc 2997 , in which one clearly defined arm in optical light is absent in infrared light @xcite . in the milky way galaxy , @xcite found that the dust emission is better fit by a four - arm spiral , while a two - arm spiral fits the stellar emission ( * ? ? ?",
    "* presents a review ) .    as a result of the coupling between the gaseous disk and the interstellar magnetic field ,",
    "the latter also is influenced by ( and influences ) the spiral pattern . since the magnetic fields are `` illuminated '' by the cosmic rays spinning along the field lines ,",
    "the so generated synchrotron emission is a direct probe of the field . in external galaxies",
    ", the total ( polarized + unpolarized ) synchrotron emission tends to follow the spiral pattern , although a displacement between the positions at which the optical and synchrotron emission peaks is not unusual .",
    "in addition , analysis of the polarization direction of the synchrotron emission shows that the magnetic field is usually aligned with the spiral arms @xcite .",
    "then , it can be argued that the large scale magnetic field plays a significant role in the formation of spiral structures in disk galaxies .",
    "@xcite explored what effect a strong galactic magnetic field would have in the vertical structure of the spiral arms .",
    "the main difference between their models and previous work was the inclusion of a thicker , higher pressure ism .",
    "the necessity of such environment was pointed out by the fact that some components of the gaseous disk were observed to have scale heights of the order of kpc @xcite , much larger than those previously considered .",
    "the support necessary for the weight of that gas is larger than the thermal pressure observed in the midplane , leading to the conclusion that non - thermal pressures must dominate the vertical hydrostatics of the galactic disk , and that the pressure scale height might be much larger that the density scale height @xcite .",
    "when those pressures significantly increase the effective @xmath2 of the medium , the gas flowing into the spiral arms shows a combination of a shock and a hydraulic jump at the position of the spiral arms , which induced large vertical gas motions . such behavior appears to have been observed in ngc 5427 @xcite .    in an earlier work ( *",
    "* paper i from here on ) , we extended @xcite analysis to three dimensions and included a large fraction of the galactic disk .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to further explore those results and aim more directly at the milky way structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ section_setup ] summarizes the results of paper i , presents the initialization of the simulations we present here , and describes the basic features of the flows at an age of @xmath3 ; section [ section_bfield ] describes the magnetic field structure , the synchrotron emission , and the field - density relationships ; section [ section_hydrostatics ] explores the elements of the support of the disk and the vertical hydrostatics near the solar circle ; section [ section_periodicity ] explores periodicity and normal frequencies in the simulation ; section [ section_circulation ] describes the large scale motions encountered in the simulation and evidence for circulation ; and section [ section_conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "details of the setup are provided in paper i. here we present only an overview , mentioning the differences from the cases presented there .",
    "we performed three - dimensional mhd simulations using the code zeus @xcite to model the ism response to a spiral gravitational perturbation .",
    "the gas starts in vertical and radial hydrostatic equilibrium , following the circular orbits defined by the background gravitational potential from model 2 in @xcite , the pressure gradient ( thermal plus magnetic ) , and the magnetic tension .",
    "the magnetic field is azimuthal , with a strength defined by the relation :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the magnetic pressure , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the equation of state for the initialization is isothermal with a temperature @xmath8 .",
    "as shown in paper i , by defining the density profile in the midplane ( in our cases , an exponential with a scale length of @xmath9 and large @xmath0 . ] , with @xmath10 at @xmath11 ) , all the equilibrium variables are easily found .",
    "again , the hydrostatics , the magnetic field geometry , and the density - magnetic pressure relation are only enforced in the initialization .",
    "all of them are altered considerably by the mhd evolution .",
    "the simulations were carried out in a cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "the grid spans from @xmath12 to @xmath13 in the radial direction , 0 to @xmath14 in @xmath0 and 0 to @xmath15 in azimuth for the four - arm models ( 0 to @xmath16 in two - arm models ) .",
    "both @xmath17 and @xmath0 boundaries are reflective , while periodic boundaries are set in the azimuth",
    ".    this initialization yields the distribution presented in figure [ initial ] . with slightly different parameters (",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , the vertical density at the solar circle would closely resemble the one described in @xcite .",
    "we chose to use a lower magnetic pressure because we expected that the accumulation of the gas in the spiral arms would increase the magnetic field to values closer to those observed .",
    "also , we expected that the gas dynamics could possibly generate a random component of the field ; this did not occur .",
    "there are several possible reasons : low spatial resolution , numerical diffusivity , a low effective reynolds number , a near laminar flow , or a combination of all .",
    "we chose to use a higher temperature to help offset the smaller magnetic pressure ( this was necessary because , without the extra pressure , the density drops very fast with @xmath0 , generating numerical problems ) .",
    "it should be noted that our relatively high `` thermal '' pressure is a rough approximation to the pressures provided in fact by the random field , cosmic rays , subgrid turbulence , and the comparatively weak true thermal pressure . since this pseudo - thermal component is isothermal ( except at high density , see discussion below )",
    ", it did not add the stiffness to the medium that the random field or other components would have .",
    "as a result , we likely under - represent the jump - like character of the flow and the associated vertical and turbulent motions .",
    "the rotation curve versus @xmath17 is nearly flat , increasing only slightly with @xmath0 . from equation [ mag_pres_eq ] , the alfvn velocity increases with distance from the midplane , to an asymptotic value of about @xmath20 .",
    "after the simulation started , we changed the equation of state in order to facilitate the condensation of the gas into the spiral arms .",
    "gas with @xmath21 behaves isothermally with @xmath22 ; at higher densities , the temperature of the gas is forced down , generating a thermally unstable regime , up to a density of @xmath23 , above which the gas behaves isothermally again , with @xmath24 , effectively forming a two - phase medium ( figure [ two - phase ] ) .",
    "this change will have the biggest effect near the midplane , where thermal pressure dominates the magnetic pressure .",
    "the choice of @xmath25 , rather than @xmath26 that one might expect from the heating - cooling balance , was made because this pseudo - thermal pressure represents other components that can not be radiated away , and because of our coarse resolution .",
    "it is a modest attempt to sample the effects of condensation , either due to reduced thermal pressure or self - gravity .",
    "in contrast to paper i , the calculation is performed in the reference frame of the spiral perturbation , which moves with an angular velocity of @xmath27 .",
    "the perturbation locus is a logarithmic spiral with a pitch angle of @xmath28 . in radius ,",
    "the potential perturbation varies in such a way that the implied density perturbation decays exponentially with a scale length of @xmath29 . in azimuth , the perturbation is sinusoidal , with a peak - to - valley amplitude corresponding to an arm / interarm mass ratio of 3.16 at @xmath30 . in the midplane ,",
    "the perturbation force is a relatively constant fraction , @xmath31 , of the average radial force .",
    "details of the radial and vertical shape of the perturbation are presented in @xcite .",
    "the perturbation is turned on linearly during the first @xmath32 of the simulation .",
    "also , to avoid splashing against the inner radial boundary , the perturbation forces are not applied in the @xmath33 , and smoothly increase to full strength in the next kpc .",
    "therefore , the actual useful grid extends from 5 to 11 kpc .    in summary , the differences between the models presented here and those of paper i are : the new equation of state , a higher magnetic pressure in the initialization , and the shift of the calculation to the pattern reference frame .",
    "also , in order to avoid some of the numerical problems described in paper i , we set a density floor of @xmath34 , equal to the minimum density in the initialization .",
    "we were consequently able to run the simulation to much greater ages .",
    "the setup described should be susceptible to the parker instability @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we do not expect to see the interchange mode of the instability due to our low resolution , while the undular mode is expected to be quenched by both our lack of resolution and the flow we are modeling . in order to test this expectation , we restricted the computational domain to a two - dimensional grid along the solar circle , and set up an atmosphere like the one described above .",
    "when we turned the arm perturbation off , we observed the growth of the undular mode of the parker instability .",
    "but , when the perturbation was added , the magnetic field lines bent due to the vertical motion of the gas generated by the hydraulic jump , and not so much by the weight of the gas .",
    "so , any vertical perturbation in the magnetic field will be carried along with the orbiting gas , and will be damped out when it encounters the hydraulic jump .",
    "therefore , as long as the arm - encounter time is shorter than the instability growth time scale , the undular mode of the instability should not be present",
    ".      figures [ two_arm ] and [ four_arm ] show the structures of our two standard models ( two and four arms ) after 800 myr .",
    "( unless otherwise noted , we report the state of the simulations at this time . ) in both figures , the grayscale in the upper panel shows half - disk column density ; the solid lines show the integrated pattern frame velocity field in the midplane .",
    "the grayscale in the lower panels shows a density cut at a cylindrical surface with @xmath35 .",
    "the arrows represent the velocity field in the pattern reference frame .",
    "the length of the arrows is proportional to the total velocity in the @xmath35 surface ; but , since the vertical axis is greatly stretched ( in reality , the aspect ratio of the grid is @xmath36 ) the individual components of the velocity are also stretched so that the arrows point in the corresponding direction with respect to the density structures .",
    "as these are models of trailing spirals , the gas rotates clockwise in the upper panels , and from left to right in the lower ones .    in paper",
    "i , we showed that , as the gas enters the arm , a combination of a shock and a hydraulic jump is formed .",
    "the extra stiffness the magnetic field adds to the ism makes the gas jump over the obstacle the gaseous spiral arm represents .",
    "the gas shoots up before the arm , forming an forward leaning shock , and falls back down after the arm , generating a secondary shock .",
    "in isothermal cases with no magnetic field ( paper i ) , there is much less vertical motion , the forward shock is nearly vertical , and there is no secondary shock .",
    "in the two - arm case , when the gas falls behind the arm , it bounces back up generating a high @xmath0 interarm structure that mimics another arm .",
    "the high @xmath0 material then falls again before reaching the next arm .",
    "this structure does not show up in the column density , but it is clear in both velocity and density in the lower panel of figure [ two_arm ] .",
    "it is explored in the left panel of figure [ total_flux ] , where the contours show the zero - level of the integrated vertical mass flux ( @xmath37 ) , with the dashes pointing in the downflow direction .",
    "the column density is shown in grayscale .",
    "the downflow region is broader and happens at lower densities than the upflow . also , there is a second upflow region downstream of the arm , that mimics the flow structure around the arm .",
    "a powerful bounce therefore appears to be a mechanism that might double the number of gaseous arms relative to the stellar arms , as is apparently observed in some galaxies .",
    "generally speaking , in contrast with the model of @xcite , the gaseous arms sit downstream from the perturbation minimum , but follow a tighter spiral ( with a pitch angle of about @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have not yet discovered the reasons behind either the pitch angle difference ( which appears in both 2d and 3d models ) or the phase difference relative to @xcite result .",
    "the four - arm case ( figure [ four_arm ] ) has a similar structure to the two - arm one , but presents a big difference : when the gas falls behind the arms , it does not have enough space to complete a bounce and fall again before it encounters the next arm .",
    "the downflow does lead to vertical compression ahead of the next arm , but not to a doubling of the vertical velocity pattern .",
    "the leading shock is also more vertical , especially at higher @xmath0 .",
    "the right panel in figure [ total_flux ] shows the vertical mass flux for the four - arm case . here , the upflow region is broader than in the two - arm case and ,",
    "as noted above , there is no obvious interarm bounce structure .",
    "( both two and four - arm models show higher numbers of features in narrow radial ranges , notably around @xmath39",
    ". this may be due to a resonance between vertical oscillations and arm passage time , and is associated with broadening or even doubling of the arm structure . )    it is not clear how to separate the arm and the interarm regions .",
    "we illustrate this in figure [ swollen ] .",
    "as shown in the top panel ( a reproduction of the lower panel of figure [ four_arm ] ) , the high @xmath0 structure associated with a spiral arm is very wide , as traced by the density contours . in fact , the region over which the disk thins ( the contours reach low @xmath0 ) is very narrow . on the other hand , the column density ( second panel from the top )",
    "also has clearly defined arms , but they cover a smaller region in azimuth than the high @xmath0 density structure .",
    "the arms are even narrower when we look at the midplane density ( third panel from the top ) .",
    "notice that , even if the gas flow does not bounce in the interarm , the downflow compresses the disk and generates an overdensity near the midplane before it encounters the next arm .",
    "a frequently used measure for the thickness of the disk is the ratio of the column density to the midplane density , which is an estimate of the scale height .",
    "examination of the top panel of figure [ swollen ] leads to the idea that the disk swells at the arms .",
    "but , since the arm characteristics have different extents along azimuth , the estimated scale height ( bottom panel ) has a local minimum in the middle of the arm . in the leading and trailing end of the arm , the scale height increases , as expected .",
    "this difference in the behavior of the column and midplane densities causes the scale height defined in this way to behave counter - intuitively .    in figure [ four_arm ]",
    "the arms seem to be discontinuous , with a break at about @xmath40 .",
    "each of the sections follows an even tighter spiral ( with @xmath41 pitch angle ) than the perturbation ( @xmath42 ) and the overall locus of the arm ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the locus pitch angle has the advantage that the resulting arms are a good approximation to the milky way s spiral arms as traced by @xcite .",
    "figure [ match_arms ] shows the column density of our four - arm model and the locus of the arms in the aforementioned work , scaled so that the distance from the sun to the galactic center is @xmath29 .",
    "this agreement is extensively used in @xcite , where we generate synthetic observations using this model , for comparison with real milky way data .",
    "figures [ two_arm ] and [ four_arm ] show that , as material in the midlpane approaches the arms , it moves radially outward , then shocks and follows a path nearly parallel to but soon outside of the arm , moving radially inward in the process . as we discuss below , the post shock inward flow at the midplane",
    "is smaller than the outward preshock excursion , and there is a slight migration outward balanced by inflow at higher @xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic field is carried along with this flow , and therefore has a radially outward component ahead of the arms and a radially inward component just outside of them . on figure [ v.b1 ] , these radial excursions of the field lines are plainly seen . at the locations of the arms , the field is roughly parallel to the arm locus . between the arms ,",
    "the field pitch changes from somewhat less positive than the arm pitch , to circular , to negative pitch as it approaches the next arm .    at higher",
    "@xmath0 ( figure [ v.b2 ] ) , both the velocity pattern and field structure are somewhat less regular . as expected from the gas flow , the largest vertical component of the magnetic field is found just before and after the arms .",
    "the vertical field can be as large as @xmath43 , but @xmath44 is a more typical value .    the two - arm case ( not shown ) has a much smoother magnetic field .",
    "it can also show negative pitch in the interarm region , but it does not change as abruptly as in the four - arm case . also , the vertical field is weaker , being prominent only on the leading edge of the gaseous arms .",
    "owing to our missing the random field component , a synthetic synchrotron map can not represent the emission actually expected from a galaxy , but it could provide a reasonable view of the polarized fraction .",
    "figure [ synch ] shows our calculated total emission , for our four - arm case , as viewed from outside the galaxy , with lines showing the directions of the apparent field ( perpendicular to the @xmath45 field polarization of the integrated emission ) , assuming no faraday rotation .    at any given distance above the plane ,",
    "the emissivity is given by :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the component of the field parallel to the plane of the galaxy , @xmath48 is the spectral index of the electron cosmic ray distribution , @xmath49 is the spatial distribution of the electron cosmic rays , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this emissivity is integrated along a line of sight perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the polarization is calculated by estimating the polarized emission parallel and perpendicular to @xmath47 ,    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the degree of polarization of the emissivity . given the angle @xmath54 and the intensities @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 at a certain @xmath0 , the intensities and parallel direction at @xmath58 are given by :    @xmath59 }         { ( i_\\perp - i_\\parallel)+          ( \\varepsilon_\\perp - \\varepsilon_\\parallel ) dz          \\cos[2(\\beta-\\alpha)]}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\\\ i'_{tot } & = & i_{tot } + \\varepsilon_{tot } dz \\\\ i'_\\parallel & = & i_\\perp+\\varepsilon_\\perp dz                -(i_\\perp - i_\\parallel)\\cos^2(\\alpha'-\\alpha )                                                  \\nonumber   \\\\            & & -(\\varepsilon_\\perp-\\varepsilon_\\parallel ) dz                 \\cos^2(\\alpha'-\\beta ) \\\\",
    "i'_\\perp & = & i'_{tot}-i'_\\parallel,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath60 is the direction parallel to the magnetic field at @xmath58 .",
    "notice that @xmath61 is not the direction of polarization nor the direction of the magnetic field , but the direction of the inferred b - field , as traced by the synchrotron emission .    in figure",
    "[ synch ] we can see that the interarm turning of the b - field happens around the area of minimum emission , which is consistent with the picture of being a consequence of stretching the field . the higher intensity regions tend to be slightly upstream from the arm .",
    "the degree of polarization is quite large ( about 70% ) .",
    "this is expected , since our resolution does not allow us to model the random component of the field , that might depolarize the emission .",
    "only a shift in the direction of the b - field with @xmath0 reduces the polarization from the @xmath62 of the intrinsic emissivity .    for our two - arm case ( not shown ) ,",
    "the polarization changes are not as abrupt , the arms are more continuous ( no blobs with associated peaks of synchrotron emission ) , and the difference in the positions of the peaking of emission and column density is smaller .",
    "figure [ synch ] is to be compared with the maps from @xcite . in that work ,",
    "an atlas of synchrotron emission in external galaxies is presented .",
    "they compared the polarized and total emissions , as a way of comparing the total ( random + regular ) and regular b - fields ( again , we do not have enough resolution to say much about the random field ) .",
    "they consistently found islands of synchrotron emission and displacements between the synchrotron and gaseous arms not so different from the ones found here .",
    "we did not find magnetic arms without a density counterpart , which have been occasionally found in polarized emission observations and some simulations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "galaxies should have a lot of random field in the spiral arms , generated by both the turbulence of the jump and stellar feedback , but the post arm flow should stretch the field to greater regularity in the interarm region .",
    "to the extent that this is true , we would expect the mean convected field to follow the pattern just described .",
    "some observations @xcite suggest that in some galaxies there are magnetic arms , regions of enhanced polarized synchrotron emission not associated with the gaseous arms .",
    "our finding that in two - arm spirals , with their longer interarm transit , the flow tends to bounce and generate an arm - like structure in the interarm region could also be related to this phenomenon .",
    "a detailed exploration of these points is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "the relationship between magnetic field strength and density in the interstellar medium is an interesting diagnostic of the behavior of the flow . to the extent that the various components of the ism are all just the current states of material that samples all states , so that there is no intrinsic relationship between density and flux",
    ", the relationship should distinguish the various dynamical possibilities .",
    "if the field were small enough to be dynamically insignificant , compressions on average should be three dimensional , which with flux freezing would yield @xmath63 .",
    "if the field were so strong that it dominates the pressure , compressions would be possible only along the field , and there would be no dependence of field strength on density , except in dynamically active environments .",
    "measurements of the field strength in the midplane , at average and lower densities seem to find no dependence of @xmath64 with @xmath65 @xcite . at densities high enough that local dynamics or self gravity is important , higher field strengths ( and higher total pressures ) are found @xcite . at the lower densities ,",
    "some measurements provide only upper limits to local region fields , but the strong fluctuations in pulsar dispersion measures and the overall synchrotron emissivity seem to imply that the rms field is several microgauss .",
    "it would appear that most of the volume , even at low density , must have fields of this order ( see discussion in valle , 1997 ) .",
    "our simulation can be explored for its @xmath66 relationship , though some care is required in interpretation .",
    "two factors must be kept in mind .",
    "first , we initialize our run with a very strong dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath65 , as given by equation [ mag_pres_eq ] .",
    "it is almost certain that far from the plane of the galaxy , not only is the density low , but so is the magnetic field .",
    "our initialization is a specific rule for this relationship , and determines the static vertical structure .",
    "we observe , however , that even in our relatively laminar flow , material makes large vertical excursions in its response to the arm disturbance ( see section [ section_circulation ] ) .",
    "thus , the material found at any given height will have a wide spread in initial heights , and therefore , a wide spread in initial @xmath66 .",
    "this is more true further from the plane , but should not be discounted close to the plane as well .",
    "the second point is that because we do not have a significant random field , it may be easier for material to move along the field than in the actual galaxy .",
    "this is not necessarily true if , for example , most of that motion occurs in interarm regions where the field is less random ( as discussed above ) .",
    "it is also possible that in the actual galaxy , a considerable amount of motion along fields is driven at small scales and high densities by stellar feedback in the arms , and then frozen in as the material and field are stretched out between the arms , the field returning to its pressure defined equilibrium , with whatever distribution of density is left from the small scale dynamics .    in short , the results we are",
    "about to present are suggestive , but can not be assumed to represent reality very precisely .",
    "owing to our strong @xmath66 in the initialization , we restrict our presentation to material found between 7 and @xmath67 , and present three ranges in @xmath0 , close to the plane , intermediate , and high , the boundaries between them being at 50 and @xmath68 .",
    "we also separate the material into two equal halves ( in space ) , one containing the arms , the other not .",
    "the results are shown in the six panels of figure [ mag_dens_arms ] .",
    "the contours are of volume containing @xmath66 .",
    "there are also several lines on these diagrams , one showing the @xmath66 of the initialization , one showing the locus of equal magnetic and thermal pressures , and one ( shown only on the midplane arm plot ) showing a line of constant total pressure of @xmath69 .",
    "there are several things to notice .",
    "first , at no height does the initial trend of @xmath66 represent the trend of the data , though in every diagram , significant amounts of material are found along parts of the initialization .",
    "next , there are three characteristic features found in the plots , sections where the distribution has a major horizontal feature , sections where there is a major feature or slope somewhat steeper than the initialization , but lower than the slope ( one ) expected from purely transverse compression , and in the midplane , a feature at the highest densities which has a concave upward boundary .",
    "the horizontal segments , most noticeable at the intermediate heights , are exclusively found in regions in which the magnetic pressure is higher to significantly higher than the thermal pressure .",
    "our flow thus seems to reproduce the expectation that in such regions the dominance of magnetic pressure is accompanied by flows parallel to it .",
    "the vertical width of the horizontal segment should then be associated with the spread in pressures found between 50 and @xmath68 in the central pair of panels .",
    "the width is roughly a factor of 1.4 in @xmath64 and therefore 2 in pressure , more or less consistent with the pressure variation with height presented in section [ section_hydrostatics ] .",
    "the fact that this behavior is not well represented in the midplane is likely due to our initialization with dominant thermal pressure at the midplane densities .",
    "notice that in our simulation , the densities within @xmath70 of the midplane are never as low as those expected for intercloud regions in the milky way .",
    "the inclined segments have @xmath71 or so , roughly as expected from isotropic compression , a little steeper than the initialized relationship . instead of showing isotropic compression",
    ", it could be a mixture of the initialization and the @xmath72 expected from purely transverse compression .",
    "we do not therefore give definitive reasons for this behavior , but note that it is always found in material whose magnetic pressure is less than or comparable to its thermal pressure .",
    "it is in the regime for which isotropic compression is plausible .",
    "the third feature , the concave upward behavior at the highest densities close to the plane , appears to be a consequence of our thermal equation of state .",
    "this behavior occurs at those densities for which the temperature is rapidly decreasing with increasing @xmath65 , requiring a higher value of @xmath64 to have the same total pressure .",
    "notice the similarity of the locus to the constant pressure line superimposed .",
    "various authors ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have attempted to reconcile the apparent midplane pressure of the galaxy with the weight of the material above it . in this section ,",
    "we test two aspects of this procedure , whether such equality is expected locally ( for example , in the immediate neighborhood of the sun , there appears to be a scarcity of material relative to the average and one might wonder whether this should be reflected in a lower than average midplane pressure ) , and the degree to which dynamics contributes to the overall balance .    in figure [ pressure ]",
    "we compare the midplane thermal plus magnetic pressure with the integral of the overlying weight per unit area versus phase along a line of constant galactocentric radius of 8 kpc .",
    "the half - disk column density is also provided for comparison .",
    "the mean value of the midplane pressure ( @xmath73 ) is in good agreement with the mean weight ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "but the behavior with phase shows much more interesting structure .",
    "the midplane pressure does have significant variations , as does the weight , and they are correlated to some degree .",
    "a perfect match is not expected because material does not evolve on constant radius , because these results are for one specific time , during which things might be slightly out of equilibrium , and because the pressure calculated does not include dynamical contributions .",
    "still , it is possible to get a sense of the dynamical behavior from this plot .",
    "for @xmath75 to 1 , the column density is nearly constant , so the weight is a measure of the vertical extent . from left to right , the weight falls , as does the material , raising the midplane density and pressure .",
    "the trend reverses about @xmath76 to upflow , increasing weight and decreasing pressure .",
    "this is a bounce .",
    "then , there is a sudden increase in pressure and weight , a shock , that raises the pressure above the weight , though only slightly .",
    "this is the hydraulic jump .",
    "it sustains the upflow , roughly stabilizing the increased height .",
    "thereafter , the flow accelerates parallel to the plane , decreasing the pressure , weight , and column density .",
    "because the effective @xmath2 is grater than 1 , the pressure drops faster than the weight , leading to downflow , a downstream pressure increase and weight minimum , ready to bounce again .",
    "we have explored the vertical hydrostatics more precisely , averaging over phase to see how the contributions to pressure versus height are arranged .",
    "we can not explore the importance of magnetic tension as @xcite did , since our model has restrictions that limit the development of vertical magnetic field , namely , lack of spatial resolution , no cosmic rays pushing the magnetic lines , nor an effective dynamo .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the large scale motions of the gas provide a significant fraction of the support .",
    "consider the vertical component of the momentum conservation equation :    @xmath77 =    -\\rho g_z - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\left(p_{th}+p_m\\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 is the component of the velocity in the vertical direction , @xmath79 is the vertical gravitational acceleration , @xmath80 is the gas density , @xmath81 is the thermal pressure , and @xmath82 is the magnetic pressure . here , we used the approximation proposed in @xcite , in which the magnetic pressure is diminished by the magnetic tension : @xmath83 . in our model ,",
    "the vertical field is not very large , and the magnetic tension is only a small fraction of the vertical support . in the case of @xmath84 ,    @xmath85    in figure [ pres_terms ] ,",
    "the left panel shows the four different integrated terms in the right side of equation [ hydro_2 ] , and the right panel compares the left and right hand sides of the equation . in that figure",
    ", @xmath86 is the value of the thermal plus effective magnetic pressure at the upper boundary at @xmath87 .",
    "all the plotted quantities are actually the mean values along the solar circle , so that the effect of the spiral arms is averaged out to give a global picture . in order to calculate the weight of the gas , the total gravitational potential ( background + perturbation )",
    "was used , but it makes little difference , since the actual value of the perturbation is small compared with the background potential .",
    "figure [ pres_terms ] shows that the spatially averaged disk atmosphere is actually very close to hydrostatic at the @xmath88 time shown .",
    "although most of the pressure is balanced by the weight of the gas , the convective terms have a significant influence , specially at intermediate @xmath0 . as expected , the first two convective terms work into supporting the weight of the gas , generating kinematic pressure . but",
    "the fourth term , the vertical kinematic pressure @xmath89 , has the same sign as the gas weight .",
    "this is because its average is biased toward the highest vertical velocity regions .",
    "such regions are the downflow behind the arms , where @xmath78 is negative and becoming more negative with increasing @xmath0 . as hinted by figure",
    "[ pressure ] , the midplane disk pressure has to decelerate the downflow in addition to supporting the weight of the gas .    at different times ,",
    "the lines showing the weight of the gas ( dashed line in the right panel of figure [ pres_terms ] ) and pressure ( solid line ) oscillate only slightly around each other , suggesting that the vertical hydrostatics described above is not atypical .",
    "the simulations do not seem to be in a steady state , but rather in a steady cyclic behavior , in which the `` wave - like '' structure that is formed above the gaseous arms breaks , only to be regenerated at the back of the arm and rise again .",
    "the periodicity of the simulation can be assessed by plotting the vertical mass flow , at a given height , integrated over the @xmath90 plane , as a function of time .",
    "such a plot for the four - arm case is presented in figure [ mass_flux ] .",
    "the chosen height is @xmath91 , which is right across the `` breaking wave '' structure ( see figure [ four_arm ] ) .",
    "the left panel of figure [ mass_flux_fourier ] shows the fourier transform of this vertical flux for @xmath92 .",
    "it shows a strong peak at about @xmath93 . that peak grows smaller",
    "if we restrict the integration to only a range of @xmath14 around @xmath35 ( @xmath14 is the typical width of the gas radial motions , see section [ section_circulation ] ) .",
    "the right panel of figure [ mass_flux_fourier ] shows that case .",
    "notice that a second strong peak at @xmath94 appears .",
    "both peaks are present when we move the integration range to @xmath95 and @xmath96 , although they both move to slightly smaller periods and the large period peak becomes weaker than the short period one as we go to smaller radii .",
    "we performed a linear perturbation analysis of the vertical motions of the disk in order to understand the origin of these periods .",
    "the procedure is very similar to the one followed in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "consider the equation of motion in the vertical direction for an plane - parallel isothermal atmosphere :    @xmath97    where @xmath98 is the velocity , @xmath80 is the mass density , @xmath99 is the total pressure ( thermal plus magnetic ) , and @xmath100 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "consider perturbations to the ( hydrostatic ) equilibrium distribution ,    @xmath101    substituting these into equation [ eq_motion ] , and eliminating the hydrostatic equilibrium condition , we get :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 . using mass conservation ,    @xmath104    and assuming that @xmath105 , we can eliminate @xmath106 to get ,    @xmath107    + v \\left [ \\frac{\\rho_0''}{\\rho_0 }       - \\left(\\frac{g + ( c^2)'}{c^2}\\right)^2      + \\frac{\\omega^2}{c^2 } \\right ] = 0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath108 .",
    "( notice that this equation reduces to a sound equation for very large frequencies . )",
    "equation [ v_pert_eq ] can be solved numerically for the initial density and pressure conditions of the simulation , for a given frequency @xmath109 .",
    "we explored a range of values for @xmath109 and looked for solutions to equation [ v_pert_eq ] that are consistent with the zero vertical velocity boundary conditions we imposed in the simulation .",
    "the lowest frequency consistent with the boundary conditions corresponds to a period of about @xmath32 for the vertical gravity and density structure at @xmath35 . as with the analysis from figure [ mass_flux_fourier ] , that period decreases as we move inward ( @xmath110 at @xmath95 ) , and increases outward ( @xmath111 at @xmath112 ) .",
    "we did not find a period corresponding to the other @xmath113 peak , which could involve radial motions .",
    "in this section , we look for global trends in the gas motions to explore circulation and radial motions of the material . in order to do so , we averaged all the velocities and densities of the simulation for the period of @xmath114 . then , we integrated the resulting mean velocity field in order to get the trajectory of an imaginary test particle .",
    "the result for the four - arm case is presented in figure [ paths ] . in this , the grayscale is the time averaged density at @xmath115 .",
    "the lines show the trajectory in @xmath17 and @xmath0 that a test particle follows in the mean velocity field in going from @xmath115 to @xmath15 ( one arm encounter time , which differs with radius ) , ending at the position with the larger dot .",
    "the first thing to notice in this diagram is that , as the gas goes between arm and interarm regions , it moves a typical distance of about @xmath14 in @xmath17 , and a varying amount in @xmath0 ; sometimes , the vertical displacements can be as large as @xmath116 .",
    "also , the trajectories have a slanted appearance .",
    "this is consistent with what has been mentioned before : at the spiral shock , the gas shoots up and then moves radially inward along the arm . after leaving the arm ,",
    "the gas falls down and moves out in radius as it approaches the next arm .",
    "the difference between the roughly looping orbits seen at low @xmath0 and the prostrate `` s '' shapes at higher @xmath0 is that material at low @xmath0 is moving outward at minimum height , whereas at high @xmath0 it is moving inward .",
    "reference to figure [ four_arm ] shows that , at low @xmath0 , minimum height occurs at the interarm bounce , where material is moving outward , while at high @xmath0 , minimum height occurs downstream of the leading edge of the arm , where material has already begun to move in .    in figure [ arrows ] , we plotted an arrow from the initial to the final positions of the test particle .",
    "the interpretation of this diagram is not straightforward .",
    "each parcel is followed through one fourth of a rotation , relative to the pattern .",
    "it typically ends up at both a different @xmath0 and @xmath17 , and at a different @xmath17 it is in a different phase with respect to the arm , as evidenced by the shift relative to the density distribution shown .",
    "the pattern is also incomplete , in that it shows no obvious source of replenishment for material above @xmath117 outward of @xmath118 .",
    "what is clear is that there is a general circulation pattern counterclockwise about each arm structure , in which material above @xmath68 has large radial and vertical net excursions .",
    "higher @xmath0 material tends to move inward , and lower @xmath0 outward , though at lower velocity and higher density .",
    "in the upper regions of the inner edge of each arm , there is some indication of inward motion that transits from one arm to the next , but we are reluctant to conclude , from modeling by this eulerian code , that there is thorough mixing of material across the disk .    the fact that the net circulation pattern has several cells , one associated with each arm , shows that it is not a simple consequence of our closed inner and outer boundaries , which might have led to a single cell of circulation .",
    "this figure is ambiguous about what happens to material very close to the plane , leading us to study the average radial velocity of material as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we calculated the mean radial velocity of the gas at different heights by averaging the radial velocity at a given @xmath0 , weighted by the density at that point :    @xmath119    in figure [ radial_flow ] , we present this mean radial velocity for the time averaged four - arm case .",
    "the velocities are inward and significant above @xmath120 , reaching @xmath121 at about @xmath122 . near the plane they are outward and low , only about @xmath123 is reached .",
    "this is consistent with the observational limits ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and inferences from the previous figure .    from this ,",
    "we conclude , as anticipated , that there is net outward flow close to the plane to compensate the net inward flow at higher @xmath0 .",
    "but we are still uncertain whether this flow occurs in essentially closed cells , separately mixing material within each arm , as suggested by figure [ arrows ] for most of the material , or whether there is sufficient transit between arms for substantial global mixing .",
    "our tentative conclusion is that the velocities shown in figure [ radial_flow ] are dominated by closed cell circulation , and therefore represent a strong limit on the global mixing rate .",
    "we performed mhd simulations of the gaseous galactic disk having spiral gravitational perturbations with two and four arms .",
    "as found in @xcite and paper i , the gas motions involve vertical bouncing , plus a combination of a shock and a hydraulic jump at the gaseous arms .",
    "the comparative timescales for bouncing and interarm passage , and the realtive phases lead to complications in the details of the arm structure , as predicted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this bounce / shock / jump structure leans upstream above the plane , more noticeably in the two - arm case , where the bounce point occurs within the arm at low @xmath0 . in the four - arm case ,",
    "the low @xmath0 bounce point occurs at the interarm density peak ( at @xmath124 ) and the upward motion from the bounce leads the shock / jump structure . in both cases , the gas moves up and over the midplane arm , inward in radius .",
    "the higher @xmath0 material then falls down behind the arm , where it is again moving radially outward . in the two - arm case",
    ", the gas bounces back up and , at high @xmath0 , generates structures similar to those at the arm , as if the gas were trying to develop a four - arm structure .",
    "in the four - arm case , if the sun s position is properly chosen , the arms seem to follow the arms traced by @xcite . in both cases , the gaseous arms follow a spiral tighter than the imposed perturbation .    since the net radial inflow happens above the arms , and the gas falls in the interarm , when it is moving out before encountering the next arm , the disk averaged radial flow changes sign with height above the disk , from positive near the midplane , to negative higher up .",
    "this cycle appears to happen in cells associated with the arms , and might not represent a global mixing phenomenon .    within the spiral arms ,",
    "the magnetic field adopts a pitch angle similar to that of the arms , but it develops a negative pitch in the interarms .",
    "the vertical magnetic field is only important at the position of the largest vertical flows .",
    "our model does not include cosmic rays , supernovae or other energetic events , and therefore , it does not develop much vertical field , and the total field strength falls faster with @xmath0 than observations suggest . those shortcomings , on top of our low resolution , did not allow us to model the random component of the field , which causes us to overestimate the synchrotron polarization fraction .",
    "an examination of the relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath65 found that , when the magnetic pressure strongly exceeded the thermal , @xmath64 was constant , independent of @xmath65 .",
    "conversely , when thermal pressure is significant , @xmath64 tends to increase with @xmath65 .",
    "the disk atmosphere is close to hydrostatic equilibrium , when the dynamical terms are taken into account .",
    "it is noticeable that the downward vertical ram pressure of the gas , when averaged in azimuth , plays an important role in the hydrostatics , incrementing the effective weight of the gas .",
    "magnetic tension plays only a small part in the vertical support , an effect of the model s weak vertical fields , that may not represent the true situation .",
    "the periodicity of the structures found in this model can be estimated by fourier analyzing the vertical mass flux .",
    "we found two outstanding periods , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , the smaller of which can be explained in terms of the lowest normal mode of vertical oscillation .",
    "modelers have the huge advantage of knowing exactly where material being studied is , and its velocity .",
    "observers do not have that luxury .",
    "we will make that connection for our model in @xcite , in which we generate synthetic observations , and then explore them from the advantageous point of knowing the details of the underlying distributions .",
