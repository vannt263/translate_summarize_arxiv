    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ) offer an extreme view of the seyfert  1 phenomenon . for example , these objects show :    * the narrowest permitted optical lines , strongest optical fe  ii emission , and weakest [ o  iii ] emission ( e.g. osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; boroson & green 1992 ; grupe 2004 ) . * strong soft x - ray excesses ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; leighly 1999a ; vaughan 1999 ) above a relatively steep hard power - law ( e.g. brandt , mathur & elvis 1999 ) ; * large - amplitude x - ray variations on hourly time scales ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ; leighly 1999b ) . * weak or negligible optical variability ( e.g. klimek , gaskell & hedrick 2004 ) .",
    "many of the properties can be explained in terms of a high accretion rate and relatively low - mass black hole ( e.g. sulentic 2000 ; boroson 2002 ; grupe 2004 ) .",
    "these characteristics are not exclusive to lower - luminosity agn ( i.e. seyfert  1s ) , but are also seen in some quasar - type objects .",
    "the most famous of these _ narrow - line quasars _ is the prototype i  zw  1 , but the class also includes members such as phl  1092 , e  1346 + 266 , iras  13349 + 2438 , and the _ neta a. bahcall _",
    "object  ( bahcall , bahcall & schmidt 1973 ) .",
    "( mrk  586 ; @xmath2 ) has been the focus of previous x - ray studies with @xmath0 ( e.g. fiore 1998 ) , and @xmath3 ( fiore 1994 ) . the strong soft excess and rapid variability ( by factors of two on time scales of hours )",
    "have made it an important object to study the nature of nls1 behaviour in luminous narrow - line quasars .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the x - ray analysis of  as observed with .",
    "the x - ray brightness of  ( compared to other similar objects ) affords us the opportunity to study the nls1 phenomenon in a quasar with relatively high signal - to - noise .",
    "was observed with _ xmm - newton _ ( jansen et al . 2001 ) for @xmath4  ks on 2002 july 23 ( revolution 0480 ) . during this time",
    "the epic pn ( strder et al . 2001 ) and mos ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) cameras , as well as the optical monitor ( om ; mason et al .",
    "2001 ) and the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs1 and rgs2 ; den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) collected data .",
    "the epic pn and mos2 cameras were operated in full - frame mode and utilised the thin filter .",
    "the mos1 camera was operated in timing mode , and the data will not be included in the current analysis .    the observation data files ( odfs ) were processed to produce calibrated event lists using the _ xmm - newton _ science analysis system ( sas v6.0.0 ) .",
    "unwanted hot , dead , or flickering pixels were removed as were events due to electronic noise .",
    "event energies were corrected for charge - transfer losses , and epic response matrices were generated using the sas tasks arfgen and rmfgen .",
    "light curves were extracted from these event lists to search for periods of high background flaring .",
    "high - energy background flaring was substantial .",
    "the total good exposure times selected for the pn and mos2 were 20388  s and 31545  s , respectively .",
    "the source plus background photons were extracted from a circular region with a radius of 35@xmath5 , and the background was selected from an off - source region with a radius of 50@xmath5 and appropriately scaled to the source region .",
    "single and double events were selected for the pn detector , and single - quadruple events were selected for the mos2 .",
    "pile - up effects were determined to be negligible in the time - averaged data .",
    "however , there was mild pile - up during a @xmath6 period when the source flux increased by @xmath7 ( sect .",
    "4 ) . as a consistency check",
    "the inner @xmath8 of the source extraction region was removed , thus correcting the pile - up effect during the flare .",
    "the step proved to be unnecessary , as it had little effect on the spectral variability results ( sect .",
    "the total numbers of source plus background counts collected in the 0.310  kev range by the pn and mos2 instruments were 68372 and 29354 , respectively .",
    "the total numbers of counts collected from the scaled background region were 1187 for the pn , and 1132 for the mos2 .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observation provides a substantial improvement in spectral quality over the 51.8  ks @xmath0-sis exposure ( 118.6  ks duration ) in which @xmath9 counts were collected ( leighly 1999b ) .",
    "the rgs were operated in standard spectro+q mode .",
    "the first - order rgs spectra were extracted using the sas task rgsproc , and the response matrices were generated using rgsrmfgen .",
    "the total exposure times utilised for the analysis were 46078  s and 44717  s for the rgs1 and rgs2 , respectively .",
    "the total number of source counts in the 0.351.5  kev range were approximately 4915 ( rgs1 ) and 4708 ( rgs2 ) .",
    "the om was operated in imaging mode for the entire observation . in total , thirty - one 1000  s images were taken in three filters : 21 in @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , and 5 in both @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the average apparent magnitude in each filter was @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "each of the epic spectra was compared to the respective background spectrum to determine the energy range in which the source was reasonably detected above the background .",
    "the source was detected above the background up to an observed energy of @xmath19  kev , and @xmath20 7  kev in the pn and mos2 data , respectively .",
    "the mos data were ignored below 0.5  kev due to the uncertainties in the low - energy redistribution characteristics of the cameras ( kirsch 2003 ) .",
    "therefore , the pn data between 0.310  kev and the mos2 data between 0.57  kev were utilised during the spectral fitting , but the residuals from each instrument were examined separately to judge any inconsistency .",
    "in addition the rgs data between 0.351.5  kev were also examined .",
    "the source spectra were grouped such that each bin contained at least 20 counts .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using xspec v11.3.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "fit parameters are reported in the rest - frame of the object , although the figures remain in the observed - frame .",
    "the quoted errors on the model parameters correspond to a 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. a @xmath21 = 2.7 criterion ) .",
    "luminosities were derived assuming isotropic emission .",
    "the galactic column density toward  is @xmath22 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "a value for the hubble constant of @xmath23=@xmath24 and a standard cosmology with @xmath25 = 0.3 and @xmath26 = 0.7 was adopted .",
    "a single power - law with galactic absorption was a poor fit to the epic data between 0.310  kev ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the higher statistics in the low - energy range dominate the fit resulting in large residuals at higher energies which demonstrates the need for multiple continuum components .",
    "fitting only the epic data above 2  kev with an absorbed power - law resulted in a good fit ( @xmath28 ) and demonstrated agreement in the photon indices measured by each instrument ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) . extrapolating this model to lower energies revealed a strong soft excess above the power - law continuum ( figure  [ fig : po ] ) .    to investigate the nature of the continuum emission additional components",
    "were included in the basic power - law fit to model the soft excess .",
    "the data from each instrument were modelled separately in order to compare the results . in the case of the rgs , the high - energy model component ( i.e. the power - law )",
    "was kept fixed to the pn values .    to fit the broad - band continuum a number of models were used including ( i ) a blackbody plus power - law , ( ii ) a double power - law and , ( iii ) a broken power - law .",
    "the addition of a second continuum component was a substantial improvement to the initial power - law fit ; the best fit was obtained with model ( i ) ( figure  [ fig : cont ] ) . in this case",
    "the blackbody temperature was @xmath31  ev , and the intrinsic absorption was negligible .",
    "the 0.310  flux and luminosity , corrected for galactic absorption , were @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the 210  luminosity was @xmath34 . in table",
    "[ tab : cont ] the model parameters for each fit are given .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the 0.210  kev light curve of  is displayed in the top panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] ( with @xmath35 error bars ) .",
    "since the broad - band light curve is less sensitive to calibration uncertainties the data between 0.20.3  kev have been included .",
    "in addition , the light curve from the entire observation is shown since the source is sufficiently brighter that the background ( by about a factor of ten ) , even during the background flaring .",
    "the average count rate is @xmath36  counts s@xmath37 .",
    "the most striking feature is a flaring event about 10  ks into the observation in which the broad - band count rate increases by @xmath38% in a few thousand seconds .",
    "averaging over three data points during flare maximum at @xmath39  ks and the three lowest data points when the flare achieves minimum intensity at @xmath40  ks results in a count - rate change of 1.33 counts s@xmath37 in 3800  s ( rest - frame ) . model ( i ) from table  [ tab : cont ] is extrapolated down to 0.2  kev to estimate a 0.210  kev intrinsic luminosity of @xmath41 .",
    "thus the calculated change in count rate corresponds to a luminosity change of @xmath42l@xmath43 the luminosity rate of change is @xmath42l/@xmath42 t @xmath44 7.8 @xmath45 10@xmath46 erg s@xmath47 . quantifying this rate of luminosity change in terms of a radiative efficiency , @xmath48@xmath42l/@xmath42 t ( fabian 1979 )",
    ", we calculate @xmath49 .",
    "this is consistent with the efficiency of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "a @xmath10-filter ( @xmath11 ) light curve was constructed from the om data during the first @xmath50  ks of the observation ( lower panel of figure  [ fig : lc ] ) . in general , and in particular during the x - ray flare , the optical light curve shows no evidence of variability . a constant model fitted to the light curve was acceptable ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "in addition , two shorter light curves covering @xmath1  ks each were obtained with the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) filters .",
    "neither of these curves showed any variability ( @xmath52 for 4 @xmath53 in each filter ) .      the fractional variability amplitude ( @xmath54 ; edelson et al .",
    "2002 ) was calculated twice ( figure  [ fig : fvar ] ) .",
    "firstly , utilising data over the entire observation , and again while ignoring the data during the apparent flare ( @xmath55  ks ) .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ fig : fvar ] the non - flare rms spectrum is consistent with a constant ( @xmath56 ) . on the other hand the flare data set shows clear spectral variability , with a gradual increase in the amplitude of the fluctuations with increasing energy .",
    "a constant fit is unacceptable ( @xmath57 ) .    of interest",
    "is the notable similarity in the appearance and behaviour of the rms spectra with the rms spectra of another narrow - line quasar , i  zw  1 ( gallo et al . 2004 ) .",
    "gallo et al . also observed a flare in i  zw  1 , of similar magnitude and duration to that seen in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "in addition , it was discovered that the flare in i  zw  1 was concentrated in the hard energy band ( i.e. 210  kev ) , and that it induced spectral variability as suggested by figure  [ fig : fvar ] .    in figure  [ fig : hr ] we present normalised light curves in the 0.20.5  kev and 210  kev bands .",
    "the light curves were normalised to the average count rate during the non - flare periods ( i.e. excluding the data between @xmath55  ks ) . as in i",
    "zw  1 , the flare appears to be concentrated in the harder energy band ( though much less significant than for i  zw  1 ) .",
    "the hardness ratio between the two light curves is also presented in figure  [ fig : hr ] , and shows a difference in the hardness ratio before and after the flare .",
    "examining a `` flaring '' spectrum in detail is difficult due to the small number of good events in the first half of the observation .",
    "the mean spectrum is essentially dominated by the data in the post - flare regime ( after @xmath58  ks ) .",
    "the main results of this analysis are the following :    * the x - ray continuum of  was well fitted with a power - law plus blackbody with @xmath59 and @xmath31  ev .",
    "additional absorption above the galactic column density was not required .",
    "+ * a strong , broad feature was detected in the pn spectrum between 56  kev .",
    "a considerable amount of the emission , including the peak of the emission , is redward of 6.4  kev ( rest - frame ) , and extends as far down as 5  kev in the rest - frame .",
    "the feature could be fitted as a neutral iron line emitted from a narrow annulus of a disc around a schwarzschild black hole . + * a flare was detected in the light curve in which the broad - band count rate increased by about 50% in a few thousand seconds .",
    "the flare was determined to be concentrated at higher energies ( 210  kev ) and appeared to induce spectral variability . + * no optical variability was detected from even during the x - ray flare",
    ".      given the energy of the broad feature in we considered the possibility that the broad line could be the composition of several narrower lines .",
    "means to produce narrow emission lines in the 56  kev range have been suggested ( e.g. skibo 1997 ; doviak et al .",
    "2004 ) ; however the hypothetical narrow features in  do not satisfy these models physically ( e.g. lines are too strong , or absence of accompanining features , or inconsistent relative abundances ) .",
    "moreover , there was no statistical necessity to split the broad feature into multiple components .",
    "the excess emission at @xmath1  kev can be fitted as neutral iron emitted from an accretion disc around a schwarzschild or kerr black hole .",
    "the fits can not distiguish between the different line origins . in the case of a schwarzschild black hole",
    "the line would originate from a thin annulus ( @xmath60 ) close to the black hole .",
    "the feature could be fitted equally well with a simple gaussian profile , but the best - fit energy and width do not correspond with the characteristics of any elements in the region .",
    "there are three significant differences in the  observation of since it was last observed with @xmath0 ( fiore et al .",
    "1998 ; leighly 1999a , b ; vaughan et al . 1999",
    "; reeves & turner 2000 ) .",
    "firstly , the power - law slope is notably softer in this observation ( @xmath59 ) compared to the @xmath0 spectrum ( @xmath61 ) . secondly , there was no detection of a broad emission feature in the earlier observations , though at low significance there did appear to be spectral hardening with increasing energy ( fiore et al . 1998 ) .",
    "finally , a ( hard ) x - ray flare was detected with .",
    "there was also weak evidence for a temperature change in the blackbody component .",
    "the temperature measured by @xmath0 was between 160220  ev , whereas the temperature was much lower in the  data ( @xmath31  ev ) .",
    "the reliability of the measured change is questionable given that @xmath0 was not sensitive below @xmath62  kev , and due to the large range of temperatures measured in three different analyses of the same data .",
    "the average 0.610  kev  flux was about 15% lower compared to the @xmath0 flux ; however variations on this order are typical on hourly time scales .",
    "the three new features are reminiscent of the second @xmath0 observation of  during which part of the time the broad line was found redshifted below 6  kev with no component detected at 6.4  kev , and the continuum appeared unusually soft ( iwasawa et al .",
    "those authors interpreted the strange line emission as arising from an extraordinarily large gravitational redshift resulting from a flare occuring within @xmath63 of the black hole .",
    "there is ample evidence for spectral softening in agn during periods of increased 210  kev intensity ( e.g. done , madejski & zycki 2000 ; vaughan & edelson 2001 ) .",
    "merloni & fabian ( 2001 ) have described this in terms of a ` thundercloud ' model where a heating event in a compact region of the corona , likely due to magnetic reconnection ( e.g. galeev , rosner & vaiana 1979 ) , results in an avalanche of smaller events .",
    "as the hard x - ray emission is reprocessed in the disc softer spectra are produced and the luminosity of the iron line is enhanced .",
    "the scenario appears applicable here , though it is difficult to examine in detail given the limited amount of data . the softer average spectrum ( dominated by the post - flare data ) , the hard x - ray flare , and the iron line possibly emitted from an annular region are all consistent with the thundercloud model .    in this sense the flare observed in i  zw  1 ( gallo 2004 ) is different in that no variability in the power - law slope , or enhancement of the iron line emission were detected .",
    "this can still be understood in terms of the thundercloud model if the i  zw  1 flare originated closer to the disc , but farther from the black hole .",
    "thus , the flare illuminated a smaller portion of the disc , and spectral changes were smeared out in the mean spectrum . support in favour of this scenario was the non - detection of a lag between energy bands in the i  zw  1 flare .    in this most recent and sensitive x - ray observation of , this narrow - line quasar has exhibited many differences since last observed with @xmath0 .",
    "the thundercloud model ( merloni & fabian 2001 ) can be invoked to explain the hard x - ray flare , soft 210  kev power - law , and broad iron emission .",
    "whether we examine narrow - line quasars or nls1 , it is becoming quite clear that these objects are important to understand the relativistic effects close to the black hole .",
    "based on observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the usa ( nasa ) .",
