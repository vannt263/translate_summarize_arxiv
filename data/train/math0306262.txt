    "the study of fluid queues has been the subject of much recent work . in these models the queue length is considered a deterministic ( or fluid ) process , rather than a discrete random process that measures the number of customers .",
    "these models tend to be somewhat easier to analyze , as they allow for less randomness than more traditional queueing models .",
    "also , the rougher description of a queue as a fluid is thought to be adequate for many important modern applications , such as atm ( asynchronous transfer mode ) and other high speed integrated networks .",
    "some of the earliest studies of fluid queues are due to kosten @xcite , @xcite and anick , mitra and sondhi @xcite .",
    "we briefly describe the model in @xcite , since much of the latter work can be viewed as extensions / generalizations of it .",
    "there are @xmath0 identical , independent sources that turn * on * and * off * at exponential waiting times .",
    "the rate from * off * to * on * is @xmath4 and time is scaled so that the rate of the reverse transition equals @xmath5 when a particular source is * on * , it generates fluid at unit rate to a buffer .",
    "we denote the buffer content at time @xmath6 by @xmath7 this buffer is depleted at a constant ( deterministic ) rate @xmath8 as long as it is non - empty .",
    "if @xmath9 which we assume henceforth , the buffer content may be non - empty .",
    "letting @xmath10 be the number of * on * sources at time @xmath11 the buffer evolves according to the law @xmath12{c}% z(t)-c,\\text { if}\\quad x(t)>0\\\\ \\max\\left [   z(t)-c,\\ 0\\right ]   , \\text { if}\\quad x(t)=0 \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath13 denotes the integer part of @xmath14 . for simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is not an integer , so that the fractional part of @xmath8 @xmath15    since there is randomness in the evolution of @xmath16 the process @xmath17 is stochastic and the exponential distributions of the * on * and * off * periods imply that the process is markovian .",
    "these models are called markov - modulated fluid flows . of primary interest in applications",
    "is the distribution of the buffer content @xmath7 this can be obtained easily if we know the joint distribution @xmath18@xmath19 \\\\ 0   &   \\leq x , x_{0}\\ ; \\",
    "0\\leq k , k_{0}\\leq n\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but the latter is often difficult to compute .",
    "it seems that it is known explicitly only for the simplest models , such as those in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "surveys of ( single buffer ) fluid models appear in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "the steady state limit @xmath20 is considered for the model described above and the authors obtained an explicit expression for @xmath21 as a spectral representation .",
    "then , the marginal buffer distribution was obtained from @xmath22 the complexity of this function has led to various asymptotic investigations .",
    "these assume that the number of sources @xmath3 with an appropriate scaling of the state variables @xmath23 in @xcite and @xcite the theory of large deviations is used to construct an approximation to the probability that the buffer exceeds the value @xmath24 of the form @xmath25",
    "\\approx\\exp\\left [   -n\\ \\mathrm{i}% ( y)\\right ]   , $ ] where @xmath26 satisfies a variational problem that can be solved fairly explicitly .",
    "a more complete asymptotic description of this buffer overflow probability is obtained in @xcite , where the author shows that @xmath27   \\sim n^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\mathrm{i}_{1}% ( y)\\exp\\left [   -n\\ \\mathrm{i}_{0}(y)\\right]\\ ] ] and it is also shown that @xmath28 is equivalent to the solution of the variational problem in @xcite . it is furthermore established that the asymptotic approximation is quite accurate numerically .",
    "the technique used is to expand the spectral representation in @xcite using asymptotic methods , such as the euler - mclaurin formula and laplace s method @xcite .",
    "the existence of a steady state for this model requires that @xmath29 which says simply that the processing rate exceeds the average input rate .",
    "the case where this stability condition is only weakly satisfied is called heavy traffic .",
    "more precisely , this corresponds to the scaling @xmath30 in @xcite the authors obtain an approximate diffusion model in the heavy traffic limit and solve it explicitly as a spectral representation involving hermite polynomials .",
    "we note that the discrete model has @xmath31 for @xmath32 which says that there is a non - zero probability that the buffer is empty for this range of * on * sources .",
    "then @xmath33 for @xmath34 and this boundary condition was used to obtain explicitly the coefficients in the spectral representation in @xcite .    in the heavy traffic limit",
    "the joint distribution satisfies a parabolic pde , that behaves as the heat equation in a part of the domain and the backward heat equation in the remainder @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such problems arise in a variety of applications , such as counter - current separators @xcite , mean exit times @xcite , the milne problem of statistical physics @xcite , neutron transport theory @xcite and diffusion in spatially varying convection fields .",
    "their study goes back to gevrey @xcite , @xcite and more recent analyses appear in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the interesting mathematical feature of these problems is that the initial ( or boundary ) conditions can be imposed only where the pde is forward parabolic .",
    "this half - boundary condition  makes the problem difficult to analyze . the model in @xcite",
    "may be viewed as a discrete analog of these pdes and the half bc  corresponds to the condition @xmath35 that can be applied only for @xmath36    in @xcite we developed an asymptotic approach to analyze backward - forward parabolic pdes , in a limit where the diffusion coefficient is small .",
    "it is based on the ray method of geometrical optics @xcite and matched asymptotic expansions .",
    "an important feature is the careful treatment of the point on the boundary where the pde changes type from backward to forward parabolic . in this corner region",
    "the asymptotic solution may be represented as a contour integral involving airy functions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the asymptotic approach in @xcite to discrete models .",
    "we shall analyze the model in @xcite directly by using the differential - difference equation satisfied by @xmath37 we make no recourse to the exact spectral representation of the solution given in @xcite .",
    "after appropriate scalings of @xmath38 and @xmath39 we shall analyze this equation asymptotically for @xmath40 using singular perturbation methods .",
    "the asymptotic results for @xmath41 in @xcite can be easily recovered from our two - dimensional results .",
    "there are several important differences between the asymptotic structure of these discrete models and the backward - forward parabolic pde studied in @xcite .",
    "for example , the structure of the solution in the corner region , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is different than the corresponding range in the diffusion model . here the solution can be expressed in terms of bessel functions .",
    "a variety of extensions / generalizations of the model in @xcite have been recently analyzed .",
    "for example , the transient solution ( more precisely , its laplace transform over time ) is obtained in @xcite as a spectral expansion , using arguments similar to those in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the author allows the fluid input rates from the * on * sources to depend upon the buffer size .",
    "this allows for an admission control policy for the fluid level ( buffer size ) .",
    "an asymptotic analysis was done in @xcite , which assumed that @xmath0 is fixed , but that the input rates vary weakly  with the buffer size @xmath44 .",
    "finite buffer size models are considered in @xcite and in @xcite the model allows for certain sources to increase the buffer while others deplete it .",
    "the latter leads to a three dimensional problem , where one must keep track of the buffer content and also the number of active sources of either type .",
    "problems with two buffers and various priority mechanisms are studied in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite fluid models with more general birth - death modulating processes",
    "were analyzed .",
    "it seems that for the more general models considered @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the solutions are not particularly explicit .",
    "they involve either solving systems of equations or computing the eigenvalues of matrices numerically .",
    "the merit of our asymptotic approach is that it yields relatively simple formulas , which are both easy to numerically evaluate and also provide numerically accurate approximations to the performance measures , even for moderate values of the large parameter @xmath45 we use similar scalings as the large deviations studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but in contrast to these studies we provide the full asymptotic approximation and not just the exponential growth / decay rate ( in @xmath46 of the performance measure .",
    "we also carefully treat various boundary and corner regions of the state space @xmath47 and indeed we show that their analysis is needed in order to obtain the asymptotic expansions away from the boundaries .",
    "we obtain detailed results for the model in @xcite and develop the methodology to treat other models of this type .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we state the basic equations . in sections 3 - 7",
    "we analyze these in various ranges of the state space ( [ ss ] ) . in section 8",
    "we recover the one - dimensional results in @xcite .",
    "finally , in section 9 we summarize and interpret the asymptotics .",
    "in the model proposed by amick , mitra and sondhi @xcite , a data - handling switch receives messages from @xmath0 mutually independent information sources , which independently and asynchronously alternate between the * on *  and * off *  state . the number of * on *  sources forms a birth - death process @xmath10 with birth rate @xmath48 and death rate @xmath49 where the rates are conditioned on @xmath50 .",
    "each source is * on * , on average , @xmath51 of the total time .",
    "an * on *  source transmits at the uniform rate of @xmath52 unit of information per unit of time .    the switch has infinite capacity , and stores or buffers the incoming information that is in excess of the maximum transmission rate @xmath14  of the output channel .",
    "the drift @xmath53 gives the rate of increase of @xmath54 ( the buffer content at time @xmath55 when the birth - death process is in state @xmath56 that is , the rate of change of @xmath54 at time @xmath6 is @xmath57 provided @xmath58 or @xmath59 and @xmath60 if the buffer has emptied at time @xmath6 , it stays empty as long as the drift remains negative .",
    "following @xcite we define @xmath61 the stationary probabilities @xmath62 of the birth - death process can then be represented as@xmath63 in order that a stationary distribution for @xmath54 exists , the mean drift @xmath64 should be negative@xmath65   = % % tcimacro{\\dsum \\nolimits_{j=0}^{n}}% % beginexpansion { \\displaystyle\\sum\\nolimits_{j=0}^{n } } % endexpansion \\pi_{j}r_{j}<0\\ ] ] which gives the stability condition@xmath66 setting @xmath67   ; \\quad t , x\\geq0,\\quad0\\leq k\\leq n\\ ] ] and @xmath68,\\ ] ] the kolmogorov forward equations for the markov process @xmath69 are given by@xmath70 for the stationary distribution @xmath71 @xmath72 with the above rates and drift , we have@xmath73 \\,\\,f_{k-1}+(k+1)\\,\\,f_{k+1}-\\left [   \\lambda(n - k)+k\\right ]   \\,f_{k},\\quad0\\leq k\\leq n. \\label{diffeq}%\\ ] ] moreover , if the number of * on * sources @xmath38 exceeds @xmath14 , then the buffer content increases and the buffer ca nt be empty .",
    "hence,@xmath74 also,@xmath75 since @xmath76 is the probability that @xmath38 out of @xmath0 sources are * on *  simultaneously .",
    "to analyze the problem ( [ diffeq])-([finf ] ) for large  @xmath0  we introduce the scaled variables @xmath77 with @xmath78 we define the function  @xmath79  and the small parameter  @xmath80  by  @xmath81 and note that  @xmath82    then ( [ diffeq ] ) becomes the following equation for  @xmath79@xmath83   g(y , z ) \\label{eqg}%\\ ] ] and ( [ fbc ] ) implies that@xmath84    to find  @xmath79 for  @xmath80  small , we shall use the ray method .",
