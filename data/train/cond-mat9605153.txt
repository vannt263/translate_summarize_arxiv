    "the study of correlated electron systems in fewer than three dimensions continues to be an important theme in condensed matter physics . in particular ,",
    "the study of strongly correlated two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron systems on a lattice has been motivated by high - temperature superconductivity , while the study of strong correlations in continuum two - dimensional systems has been motivated by the fractional quantum hall effect@xcite . properties of high - temperature superconductors are thought by some to be strongly influenced by the weak coupling which exists between the superconducting planes . in the fractional quantum hall effect , early work by halperin@xcite anticipated novel fractional quantum hall effects due to interlayer correlations@xcite in multi - layer systems .",
    "recent technological progress has made it possible to produce double - layer two dimensional electron gas systems of extremely high mobility in which these effects can be observed .",
    "the two electron layers can either be bound in separate quantum wells@xcite as illustrated schematically in fig .  ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) or bound to opposite edges of a single wide quantum well.@xcite in both cases the 2d electron gases are separated by a distance @xmath1 small enough ( @xmath2 ) to be comparable to the typical spacing between electrons in the same layer .    in a large magnetic field",
    ", strong coulomb correlations between the layers have long@xcite been expected to lead to novel fractional quantum hall effects .",
    "correlations are especially important in the strong magnetic field regime because all electrons can be accommodated within the lowest landau level and execute cyclotron orbits with a degenerate kinetic energy . the fractional quantum hall effect occurs when the system has a gap for making charged excitations , _",
    "i.e. _ when the system is incompressible .",
    "theory has predicted@xcite that at some landau level filling factors , gaps occur in double - layer systems only if interlayer interactions are sufficiently strong .",
    "these theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally@xcite .",
    "more recently , theoretical work from several different points of view@xcite has suggested that inter - layer correlations can also lead to unusual broken symmetry states with spontaneous phase coherence between layers which are isolated from each other ( except for inter - layer coulomb interactions ) .",
    "we have argued@xcite that it is spontaneous interlayer phase coherence which is responsible for the recently discovered@xcite extreme sensitivity of the fractional quantum hall effect at total landau level filling factor @xmath3 to small tilts of the magnetic field away from the normal to the layers .",
    "( @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of electrons and @xmath6 is the number of single - particle levels per landau level . ) in a previous lengthy paper@xcite ( hereafter referred to as i ) we have developed a rather complete description of the novel physics associated with spontaneous inter - layer phase coherence in the case where there is no tunneling between the layers .",
    "the present companion paper will analyze the case of finite tunneling between the layers and the role of magnetic field tilt .",
    "many of the ideas presented in detail here are discussed qualitatively in ref .",
    "in this section we review the experimental@xcite indications that the system is spontaneously ordered and exhibits excitations which are highly collective in nature .",
    "we focus here and throughout this paper on the case of landau level filling factor @xmath3 ( that is , 1/2 in each layer ) and assume for simplicity that the electronic spin degrees of freedom are frozen out by the zeeman energy . the schematic energy level diagram for the growth - direction degree - of - freedom in the double - layer system",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig1 ] ) for the case of non - interacting electrons . for simplicity",
    "we assume that electrons can occupy only the lowest electric subband in each quantum well .",
    "if the barrier between the wells is not too strong , tunneling from one side to the other is allowed .",
    "the lowest energy eigenstates split into symmetric and antisymmetric combinations separated by an energy gap @xmath7 which can , depending on the sample , vary from essentially zero to many hundreds of kelvins",
    ". the splitting can therefore be much less than or greater than the interlayer interaction energy scale , @xmath8 .",
    "when the layers are widely separated , there will be no correlations between them and we expect no dissipationless quantum hall state , since each layer has@xcite @xmath9 . for smaller separations ,",
    "it is observed experimentally that there is an excitation gap and a quantized hall plateau.@xcite this has either a trivial or a highly non - trivial explanation , depending on the ratio @xmath10 . for large @xmath7 the electrons tunnel back and forth so rapidly that it is as if there is only a single quantum well .",
    "the tunnel splitting @xmath7 is then analogous to the electric subband splitting in a ( wide ) single well .",
    "all symmetric states are occupied and all antisymmetric states are empty and we simply have the ordinary @xmath3 integer hall effect .",
    "correlations are irrelevant in this limit and the excitation gap is close to the single - particle gap @xmath7 ( or @xmath11 , whichever is smaller ) .",
    "what is highly non - trivial about this system is the fact that the @xmath3 quantum hall plateau survives even when the tunnel splitting becomes arbitrarily small : @xmath12 . in this limit",
    "the excitation gap has clearly changed to become highly collective in nature since the observed@xcite gap can be on the scale of 20k even when @xmath13 . as we will see below , because of a spontaneous broken symmetry,@xcite the excitation gap actually survives the limit @xmath14 as illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : qhe / no - qhe ] ) .",
    "this cross - over from single - particle to collective gap is , as we will show , quite analogous to the result that for spin polarized single layers , the excitation gap survives the limit of zero land g factor and hence ` @xmath15 is a fraction too.'@xcite    a second indication of the highly collective nature of the excitations can be seen in the arrhenius plots showing thermally activated dissipation.@xcite the low temperature activation energy @xmath16 is , as already noted , much larger than @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath16 were nevertheless somehow a single - particle gap , one would expect the arrhenius law to be valid up to temperatures of order @xmath16 .",
    "instead one observes a rather abrupt leveling off in the dissipation as the temperature increases past values as low as @xmath17 .",
    "this effect is observed both in double - well systems and wide single - well systems and is consistent with the notion of a thermally induced collapse of the order that had been producing the collective gap .",
    "the third significant feature of the experimental data pointing to a highly - ordered collective state is the strong response of the system to relatively weak magnetic fields @xmath18 applied in the plane of the 2d electron gases . within a model that neglects higher electric subbands",
    ", we can treat the electron gases as strictly two - dimensional .",
    "( there is ample evidence@xcite that parallel field effects due to subband mixing within a single quantum well produce only small , albeit measurable , effects . )",
    "@xmath18 can then affect the system only if there are processes involving tunneling that carry electrons around closed loops containing flux .",
    "a prototypical such process is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : fig2 ] ) . an electron tunnels from one layer to the other at point a , and travels to point b. then it ( or another indistinguishable electron ) tunnels back and returns to the starting point .",
    "the parallel field contributes to the quantum amplitude for this process ( in the 2d gas limit ) a gauge - invariant aharonov - bohm phase factor @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the enclosed flux and @xmath21 is the quantum of flux .",
    "such loop paths evidently contribute significantly to correlations in the system since the activation energy gap is observed to decrease very rapidly with @xmath18 , falling by factors of order two to ten ( depending on the sample ) until a critical field , @xmath22 , is reached at which point the gap essentially ceases changing .",
    "to understand how remarkably small @xmath23 is , consider the following .",
    "we can define a length @xmath24 from the size of the loop needed to enclose one quantum of flux : @xmath25 .",
    "( @xmath26 = 4.137 \\times 10 ^ 5 / d [ \\aa ] b^*_\\parallel [ \\text t]$ ] . ) for @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 which is approximately twenty times the spacing between electrons in a given layer and thirty times larger than the quantized cyclotron orbit radius @xmath30 within an individual layer .",
    "significant drops in the excitation gap are already seen at fields of 0.1 t implying enormous phase coherent correlation lengths must exist .",
    "again this shows the highly collective nature of the ordering in this system associated with spontaneous interlayer phase coherence .",
    "the essential physics of spontaneous inter - layer phase coherence can be addressed either from a microscopic point of view@xcite or from a macroscopic chern - simons field theory point of view,@xcite but it is perhaps most easily explained in terms of the simple variational wave function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a state label ( for instance , the landau gauge orbital guiding center@xcite ) and we are using a pseudospin notation in which spin up refers to electrons in the upper layer and spin down refers to electrons in the lower layer.@xcite the interpretation of this wave function is that every landau orbital @xmath32 is occupied ( hence @xmath15 ) , but the system is in a coherent linear combination of pseudospin up and down states determined by the phase angle @xmath33 .",
    "this means that the system has a definite total number of particles ( @xmath15 exactly ) but an indefinite number of particles in each layer . in the absence of inter - layer tunneling ,",
    "the particle number in each layer is a good quantum number .",
    "hence this state has a spontaneously broken symmetry@xcite in the same sense that the bcs state for a superconductor has indefinite ( total ) particle number but a definite phase relationship between states of different particle number .    in the absence of tunneling ,",
    "the energy can not depend on the phase angle @xmath33 and the system exhibits a global @xmath34 symmetry associated with conservation of particle number in each layer .",
    "one can imagine allowing @xmath33 to vary slowly with position to produce excited states .",
    "because of the @xmath34 symmetry , the effective hartree - fock energy functional for these states has a gradient expansion whose leading term must have the form @xmath35 the origin of the finite ` spin stiffness ' @xmath36 is the loss of exchange energy which occurs when @xmath33 varies with position .",
    "imagine that two particles approach each other .",
    "they are in a linear superposition of states in each of the layers ( even though there is no tunneling ! ) .",
    "if they are characterized by the same phase @xmath33 , then the wave function is symmetric under pseudospin exchange and so the spatial wave function is antisymmetric and must vanish as the particles approach each other .",
    "_ states with spontaneous phase coherence have better interlayer electronic correlations and hence lower interlayer coulomb interaction energy . _",
    "if a phase gradient exists then there is a larger amplitude for the particles in opposite layers to be near each other and hence the interlayer interaction energy is higher.@xcite this loss of exchange energy is the source of the finite spin stiffness and is what causes the system to spontaneously ` magnetize ' .",
    "a skeptical reader might legitimately worry that the single - slater - determinant variational wavefunctions in terms of which we have framed the above discussion misrepresent the physics .",
    "indeed , the ground state of double - layer systems in the hartree - fock approximation has spontaneous phase coherence at all values of @xmath37 whereas we believe that this property actually holds only at a discrete set of total filling factors , including @xmath38 . to understand why these concerns would be misplaced , it is useful to briefly review some of the microscopic physics underlying the incompressible states whose occurrence is responsible for the fractional quantum hall effect . for a pair of interacting electrons confined to the lowest landau level",
    ", only one relative motion state is available for each relative angular momentum .",
    "this property means that the interaction is characterized by a discrete set of energy scales , @xmath39 , first identified by haldane@xcite and known as haldane pseudopotentials .",
    "@xmath39 is the interaction energy of a pair of electrons with relative angular momentum @xmath40 ; in the double - layer case , the pseudopotential values for interlayer and intralayer interactions will differ .",
    "many of the largest charge gaps which occur in the fractional quantum hall regime can be understood in terms of haldane pseudopotentials .",
    "for example , for double - layer systems with nearby layers the largest energy scales should be the interlayer and intralayer @xmath41 pseudopotentials .",
    "it is easy to show that it is possible to form many body - states in which pairs of particles never have @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "this is not possible for @xmath43 .",
    "thus if @xmath44 , the energy to add a charge to the system is greater than the energy to remove one , hence the charge gap .",
    "for @xmath45 it is easy@xcite to show that the only states which completely avoid pairs with relative angular momentum @xmath46 are , up to rotation in pseudospin space , identical to the wavefunctions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : variational ] ) .",
    "this is the real reason why the variational wavefunctions used above are accurate . in the following",
    "we describe low - energy states of the system as spin - texture states with a position - dependent local pseudospin orientation .",
    "the property that the low - energy states are completely specified by spin - textures , which we will use frequently in following sections , depends on both the broken symmetry of the ground state _ and _ on the existence of the charge gap .",
    "the @xmath34 symmetry leads to eq .",
    "( [ eq : xymod ] ) which defines an effective xy model which will contain vortex excitations which interact logarithmically . in a thin film of superfluid @xmath47he , vortices interact logarithmically because of the energy cost of supercurrents circulating around the the vortex centers .",
    "( in superconducting thin films the same logarithmic interaction appears but is cut off on length scales exceeding the penetration depth . ) here the same logarithmic interaction appears .",
    "microscopically this interaction is due to the potential energy cost ( loss of exchange ) associated with the phase gradients ( circulating pseudospin currents ) .",
    "hartree - fock estimates@xcite indicate that @xmath36 and hence the kosterlitz - thouless critical temperature are on the scale of 1k in typical samples .",
    "vortices in the @xmath33 field ( ` merons'@xcite ) are reminiscent of laughlin s fractionally charged quasiparticles but in this case carry charges @xmath48 and can independently be left- or right - handed for a total of four ` flavors'.@xcite bound meron pairs with opposite vorticity are the lowest@xcite energy charged excitations of the system .",
    "the finite pseudospin stiffness not only permits the presence of spontaneous pseudospin magnetization but leads to a finite charge excitation gap ( even though the tunnel splitting is zero ) .",
    "thus the qhe survives@xcite the limit @xmath49 .",
    "since the ` charge ' conjugate to the phase @xmath33 is the @xmath50 component of the pseudo spin @xmath51 , the pseudospin ` supercurrent ' @xmath52 represents oppositely directed charge currents in each layer . below the kt transition temperature",
    ", such current flow will be dissipationless ( in linear response ) just as in an ordinary superfluid .",
    "likewise there will be a linearly dispersing collective goldstone mode as in a superfluid.@xcite    to reinforce the idea that this is not an ordinary superfluid or superconductor , it is perhaps useful to rewrite the original variational wave function as @xmath53|\\psi_\\uparrow\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the fully up polarized spin state .",
    "we now see that the analogy to an excitonic insulator@xcite is closer than the analogy to a superconductor .",
    "only a gauge - neutral object ( a particle bound to a hole ) can condense and propagate freely in a strong b field .",
    "a phase gradient @xmath55 causes a flow of these neutral objects which then constitutes a spin current analogous to the charge current in a superconductor . in analogy to the excitonic insulator case , one can make a particle - hole transformation in one of the layers to produce a formal resemblance to the bcs mean field state : @xmath56    between a particle and hole ; not between two particles .",
    "it is worth remarking that there is in general an exact mapping@xcite between double - layer electron - hole systems and two - component electron systems in the limit of strong magnetic fields .",
    "the hamiltonian for a double - layer electron system is mapped , up to a constant term , to that for an electron - hole system if a particle - hole transformation is made in one of the layers .",
    "the filling factor of interest here , @xmath38 , corresponds to an electron - hole system with equal electron and hole densities and , as explained above , the spontaneous phase coherence state corresponds to an excitonic superfluid state . in the electron - hole case ,",
    "the fact that a broken symmetry ground state can occur had been appreciated some years ago.@xcite some of the recent advances in understanding the physics associated with the spontaneous - phase - coherence ground state in the electron - electron case , have important implications for the electron - hole case which we will not explore at length here .",
    "a finite tunneling amplitude @xmath57 between the layers breaks the @xmath34 symmetry @xmath58 \\label{eq : h_eff}\\ ] ] by giving a preference to symmetric tunneling states .",
    "this can be seen from the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath59 which can be written in the spin representation as @xmath60 ( recall that the eigenstates of @xmath61 are symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of up and down . )",
    "we can shed further light on the spontaneous symmetry breaking by considering the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tunnel ] ) as a weak perturbation .",
    "naively , since particle number is separately conserved in each layer for @xmath63 , one might expect @xmath64 that is , one might expect that the first - order term in the perturbation series for the energy due to @xmath57 to vanish . instead however we find that the energy shifts _ linearly _ in @xmath57 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the system area , and @xmath67 is , by definition , the magnetization which is the system s order parameter.@xcite if the interlayer spacing @xmath1 is taken to be zero , one can readily show@xcite that the variational wave function in eq .",

    "we believe however that these are merely rapid cross - overs rather than true phase transitions because the phase @xmath33 is compact .",
    "the quantum states defined by @xmath33 and @xmath74 are microscopically identical . the interpretation of @xmath33 in a sine - gordon theory as an electrostatic potential for coulomb charges or as the surface height in the solid - on - solid model requires that @xmath33 and @xmath74 be distinguishable states .",

    "we present our results in terms of an estimate of the dimensionless parameter @xmath278 which plays the central role in the long - wavelength theory .",
    "@xmath279 to plot our results we have evaluated @xmath278 in the hartree - fock approximation ; @xmath69 corresponding to full pseudospin polarization and @xmath280 where @xmath281 , and @xmath282 . both @xmath36 and @xmath57",
    "are substantially reduced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "previous estimates from finite - size exact diagonalization calculations@xcite suggest that @xmath57 is reduced by a larger fraction than @xmath36 , so that the hartree - fock approximation should increasingly underestimate @xmath278 as the layer separation increases . according to the p - t model ,",
    "the transition should occur when @xmath283 .",

    "the cusp in the energy gap seen in these figures results from the ground state level crossing and is not obviously associated with the square root singularities in the energy gap predicted by read@xcite which would be expected to appear only in much larger systems than we are able to treat .",
    "nevertheless it does show the expected behavior of weakening at larger layer separations where the spin - stiffness and hence the meron - pair string energy is weakened .",
    "we also notice that hartree - fock theory accurately predicts the critical field for @xmath288 , becomes worse at @xmath269 and fails badly at @xmath289 .",
    "the direction of the discrepancy is in the direction anticipated by the above discussion since the value of @xmath284 at the transition is smaller than @xmath290 .",
    "these results suggest that the mean source of discrepancy between the experiments of murphy _ et al . _ and",
    "the p - t theory with hartree - fock parameters is quantum fluctuations which reduce the ordered moment aligned by the effective magnetic field .",
    "this reduction is responsible for a proportional reduction in the energy gained by forming the commensurate state and reduces the parallel field strength at which the transition occurs . for parameters appropriate to the system studied by murphy _",

    "we have presented in this paper a theory of the interesting effects of a weak interlayer tunneling in double layer quantum hall systems that spontaneously develop interlayer coherence in the absence of tunneling .",
    "we have discussed the properties of the ground state , as well as low energy collective excitations ( neutral and charged ) of the system , using both effective field theory and microscopic hartree - fock approaches . in particular , we have identified a novel commensurate - incommensurate phase transition driven by an in - plane component of the external magnetic field , which has been observed in recent experiments . our theory is in good qualitative and semiquantitative agreement with experiments .",
