    "in the course of a program @xcite to study the stability under linear gravitational perturbations of the most notable nakedly singular solutions of einstein s field equations , namely , negative mass schwarzschild s solution @xcite , @xmath4 reissner ",
    "nordstrm space - time @xcite and @xmath5 kerr space - time @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , we noticed that the stationary interior region beyond the inner horizon of a kerr _ black hole _ is unstable @xcite .",
    "the existence of an initially bounded and exponentially growing solution of teukolsky equations in the  super - extreme \" case @xmath5 , of which some numerical evidence had been given earlier in @xcite , was established in @xcite , where it was shown that there are actually infinitely many unstable modes .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite , that the stationary region beyond the inner horizon of a kerr _ black hole _",
    "( i.e. @xmath6 ) is linearly unstable under gravitational perturbations .",
    "these results show that linear perturbation theory is a valuable tool to study not only weak cosmic censorship ( impossibility of formation of naked singularities ) , but also strong cosmic censorship ( impossibility of formation of cauchy horizons ) .    for the kerr spacetime , an explicit expression for the unstable modes",
    "is not given in @xcite , since they involve solutions of complicated second order ordinary differential equations , which can at best be written in terms of heun functions , providing little extra information .",
    "this , added to the complexity of the reconstruction of the perturbed metric from a solution of teukolski s equations , makes it extremely difficult to evaluate the physical meaningfulness of these unstable modes .",
    "+ the situation is different for the negative mass schwarzschild and the super - extremal reissner ",
    "nordstrm space - times , where explicit expressions for some unstable modes , which involve only elementary functions , are given in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "since the metric reconstruction process in the spherically symmetric case is much simpler , it is possible to study the effect of perturbations on the singularity , by calculating the perturbed riemann tensor invariants .",
    "we use these to select appropriate boundary conditions at the singularity that ensure the self - consistency of the linear perturbation scheme , by requiring that curvature scalars do not get corrections that diverge faster at the singularity than the zeroth order term . as an example , in the case of the schwarzschild negative mass naked singularity there are infinitely many possible boundary conditions at the singularity , parameterized by @xmath7 @xcite , only one of which satisfies the above requirement .",
    "thus , besides assuring the self - consistency of the perturbative treatment , the above procedure solves the problem of having a unique , well defined evolution of perturbations in a non globally hyperbolic background .",
    "+ the unstable modes in @xcite were recognized by cardoso and cavaglia @xcite to correspond to chandrasekar s  algebraic special \" ( as ) solutions of the linearized einstein s equations @xcite .",
    "this observation hinted in the right direction where to look for unstable modes of super - extremal reissner - nordstrm black holes @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , some of the reissner  nordstrm as modes grow exponentially in time while keeping appropriate spatial boundary conditions in the super - extremal case , as happens in the negative mass schwarzschild case . with no exception ,",
    "the as solutions are irrelevant to the stability problem of the _ exterior region of black holes _ , since they do not satisfy suitable boundary conditions , a probable reason why they remained unnoticed for such a long time . for the kerr solution ,",
    "the as modes do not satisfy appropriate boundary conditions , neither for the black hole stationary regions , nor for the naked singularity .",
    "however , it was proved in @xcite that unstable modes exist for every harmonic ( i.e. , spin weighted spheroidal harmonic ) of the teukolski equations in the super - extreme case .",
    "moreover , in @xcite a connection was spot between the unstable modes of kerr naked singularities , and unstable modes for the interior stationary region ( @xmath8 ) of a kerr _ black hole_. given the similarities in the structures of the maximal analytic extensions of kerr and reissner - nordstrm black holes , and the fact that both are affected by cauchy horizon issues , one is naturally led to ask whether the interior region of a reissner - nordstrm black hole is also unstable . in this paper",
    "we show that this is the case .",
    "we give a detailed proof of the instability of the inner region of a black hole under linear gravitational perturbations initially restricted to a compact subset of the inner region . +",
    "this provides an alternative reason to the mass inflation mechanism to disregard the extension of the space time manifold beyond the cauchy horizon : since the inner region is static but unstable , it can not be the endpoint of an evolving space time . a similar result for the kerr black hole would imply cutting off the inner region of this space time , which has closed time like curves and other pathologies .",
    "+ we will concentrate on type one ( also called `` gravitational '' , as opposed to type two or `` electromagnetic '' ) scalar ( also called `` polar '' ) linear perturbations of the metric and electromagnetic fields around the solution , since it is in this sector that we have found explicit unstable modes .",
    "the linearized einstein s equations for these type of perturbations can be reduced to a @xmath9 wave equation on a field @xmath10 in a semi - infinite domain bounded by the singularity world - line , with a time independent potential ( zerilli s equation @xcite ) .",
    "this formalism was used to prove the stability of the _ exterior static region _",
    "@xcite of the black hole . in this case",
    ", zerilli s equation can be written as a wave equation in a complete @xmath9 minkowski spacetime , with a nonsingular potential which , being positive definite , guarantees the stability under this kind of gravitational perturbations @xcite .",
    "+ when applied to the static black hole inner region @xmath8 , instead , one gets a wave equation on a half @xmath9 fiducial minkowski spacetime bounded by the singularity worldline , and the potential has an unexpected second order pole at an inner point in the domain ( that we call `` kinematic singularity '' ) , besides the expected divergence at the singularity .",
    "this makes the initial value problem for the inner region far more difficult than that for @xmath11 .",
    "these technical difficulties , however , are entirely analogous to those that arise in the linear perturbation problem of a negative mass schwarzschild spacetime , a problem which was solved recently in @xcite . as in the schwarzschild case ,",
    "the second order pole in the potential can be traced back to the fact that the zerilli field @xmath10 , as defined , is a singular function of the perturbed metric and electromagnetic fields at the kinematic singularity ( from where the name  kinematic \" comes ) .",
    "thus , an alternative field @xmath12 has to be introduced to properly analyze perturbations @xcite .",
    "this is related to @xmath10 by an intertwiner operator : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a tortoise radial coordinate . in terms of @xmath12 ,",
    "the type one scalar gravitational perturbation equation is a @xmath9 wave equation @xmath16 , @xmath17 , with a potential @xmath18 that is regular everywhere .",
    "once an appropriate self - adjoint extension of @xmath19 is chosen -and , as explained above , there is a unique physically motivated choice- , the evolution of initial data is unambiguously defined by means of an @xmath19 mode expansion of the data .",
    "this gives a dynamics in spite of the fact that the background is non globally hyperbolic ( see @xcite for a similar approach ) .",
    "the intertwining technique and choice of self - adjoint extension is explained in detail in section [ sinter ] .",
    "previously , in section [ lp ] , we review of the basics of the reissner - nordstrm solution , its linear perturbations , the factorization of zerilli s hamiltonian , and chandrasekhar s algebraic special modes .",
    "+ several technical aspects of the problem are dealt with in the appendixes .",
    "in particular , we include an algebraic procedure for the explicit construction of the vector and scalar zero modes considered in the paper .",
    "this section contains all the material required for the proof of instability in section [ sinter ] .",
    "we first review some basic facts on the maximal analytic extension of the solution to the einstein - maxwell equations ( section [ mae ] ) , and on the reduction of the linearized field equations around this solution to decoupled 1 + 1 wave equations ( section [ rwz ] ) .",
    "then in section [ invs ] we calculate the perturbed riemann tensor invariants , to determine the appropriate boundary conditions at the singularity for the self - consistency of the perturbation method . in section [ asm ]",
    "we review from @xcite the factorization of the regge - wheeler and zerilli hamiltonians , and its connection to chandrasekhar s `` algebraic special '' modes , which are central in the proof of instability that follows .",

    "orbit \" manifold times a unit two sphere .",
    "the maxwell field on this space - time is @xmath22 in ( [ rn ] ) , @xmath23 is the norm of the killing vector @xmath24 , @xmath25 the latter form being useful when @xmath26 , in which case the roots of @xmath23 are positive real numbers , @xmath27 , and correspond to the horizon radii .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind the relation between the alternative two - parameter descriptions of ( [ rn ] ) @xmath28 @xmath29 is timelike in the exterior ( @xmath0 ) and interior @xmath30 regions .",

    "@xmath0 , ii : @xmath32 and iii : @xmath33 arise ad infinitum , giving rise to the penrose diagram displayed in figure 1 .",

    "drawn thicker is a cauchy horizon for the initial data surface @xmath40 , the @xmath41 extension beyond it ( in particular , the two copies of region iii just above it being non unique , unless analyticity of the metric is required.,height=340 ]    given a complete spacelike surface such as @xmath40 in figure 1 , a cauchy horizon ( thicker @xmath2 horizon in the figure ) develops at @xmath2 .",
    "this is the boundary of the maximal domain of development of the data , and it is connected to @xmath40 by timelike curves of _ finite _ proper time .",
    "the solution of the einstein - maxwell equations is unique only up to the cauchy horizon , and , although the spacetime is @xmath42 extensible beyond it -as shown in figure 1- the extension is not determined by the data in @xmath40 , and is non unique .",
    "this lack of predictability in a classical theory of fields moved penrose @xcite to postulate what is known as the _ strong cosmic censorship conjecture _ , according to which , for generic initial data in an appropriate class , the maximal domain of development is inextensible ( thus guaranteeing the preservation of predictability ) .",
    "the idea that under more realistic assumptions than perfect spherical symmetry a cauchy horizon would not develop , is supported by the finding that certain natural derivatives of a perturbation field diverge as the cauchy horizon is approached from region ii @xcite , and by israel and poisson `` mass inflation '' model @xcite .",
    "an alternative , non perturbative approach was carried out by dafermos @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "spherical symmetric solutions to the einstein - maxwell - scalar field system are studied .",
    "the ( uncharged ) scalar field was added to get around the uniqueness birchoff theorems in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "a characteristic problem is solved combining reissner - nordstrm data at the event horizon with generic matching data at the other null edge coming out the bifurcation sphere at @xmath3 .",
    "it is shown that , generically , the hawking mass diverges at the cauchy horizon , and thus the spacetime fails to be @xmath43 extendible beyond it .",
    "+ the results in this paper contribute to the idea that the extended spacetime depicted in figure 1 is an irrelevant solution of the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "we show that a linear perturbation of the metric and maxwell fields in region iii , compactly supported away from the cauchy horizon and the singularity , will grow exponentially in time , showing that region iii is in fact an unstable static solution of the einstein - maxwell equations .      the linearized einstein - maxwell equations around ( [ max ] )",

    "this is not the case for the scalar mode @xmath69 , which has a quadratic pole at @xmath66 , with a positive coefficient .",
    "the singularities at @xmath70 and @xmath71 have very different origins .",
    "the first one is due to the spacetime singularity at this point , whereas the second one can be traced back to the definition of @xmath72 , which happens to be a singular function of the metric and maxwell field first order variations at this point ( see , e.g. , ( [ s1])-([s3 ] ) ) , this being the reason why we refer to it as a  kinematic \" singularity .",

    "+ the local solutions of @xmath368 , are of the form @xmath369 with @xmath331 and @xmath330 arbitrary , @xmath370 independent of @xmath371 up to @xmath372 .",
    "consider the action of @xmath221 on a function like this further subject to the condition ( [ ci ] ) .",
    "if the intertwiner also satisfies ( [ ci ] ) , the degree of contact will be @xmath373 , then @xmath374 will be @xmath375 , and thus @xmath247 will be @xmath376 .",
    "in this appendix we describe a procedure that allows the construction of the zero mode solutions for both vector and scalar modes .",
    "we start with the vector zero modes by first considering the differential equation they satisfy . in accordance with ( [ eqp ] , [ pots ] ) , and ( [ eqp2 ] ) with @xmath377 , this is given by , @xmath378      a simple analysis of the indicial equation shows that near @xmath70 this equation has two independent solutions , one behaving as @xmath381 , and the other as @xmath382 , both admitting a power series expansion .",
    "we consider therefore an expansion for @xmath383 of the form , @xmath384 replacing in ( [ aw01 ] ) we find that we must set @xmath385 , and , @xmath386 the coefficient @xmath387 can be chosen arbitrarily , in accordance with the indicial equation , and @xmath388 is given by , @xmath389    for the remaining coefficients , including @xmath388 , we find a three term recursion relation of the form , @xmath390 and , therefore , all the coefficients are determined once @xmath347 , and @xmath387 are given .",
    "but this implies that for any given @xmath46 , and @xmath326 , we may choose @xmath387 such that @xmath391 , and then all coefficients for @xmath392 vanish .",
    "calling @xmath393 this solution we have , @xmath394 where @xmath395 is a polynomial of order @xmath396",
    ". the lowest order polynomials are , @xmath397 where we have fixed , for simplicity , @xmath398 . with this normalization ,",
    "the polynomials are positive and decreasing functions of @xmath62 near @xmath70 .",
    "we shall now prove that they have no zeros in the interval @xmath399 .",
    "we write ( [ aw01 ] ) in the form , @xmath400 and notice that @xmath393 can have only simple zeros in @xmath60 because the coefficients in ( [ aw08 ] ) are regular functions of @xmath62 in @xmath60 .",
    "since sufficiently near @xmath70 we have @xmath401 and @xmath402 , and the coefficients on the rhs in ( [ aw08 ] ) are both positive , the sign of @xmath403 is not fixed .",
    "we notice however that at the first zero of @xmath393 for @xmath404 we must have @xmath402 , and therefore , we also have @xmath405 . since to the right of such a zero , and as long as @xmath406 , ( since the coefficients are still positive ) we must have both @xmath402 , and @xmath405 , and therefore @xmath407 , there can be no other zero for @xmath406 .",
    "this proves that there is at most one zero for @xmath408 .",
    "+ but now we notice that near @xmath337 , equation ( [ aw08 ] ) has a singular solution ( diverging as @xmath409 ) and a unique regular solution of the form , @xmath410\\ ] ] since @xmath393 is regular , it has the form ( [ ae09 ] ) , and this implies that close to @xmath337 the regular solution and its first derivative have opposite signs .",
    "this contradicts the result obtained under the assumption that there is a zero in @xmath60 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath393 does not vanish for @xmath408 .",
    "+ similarly , we find that near @xmath379 , equation ( [ aw08 ] ) has a singular solution ( diverging as @xmath411 ) and a unique non vanishing regular solution .",
    "this implies that @xmath395 can not vanish for @xmath379 .",
    "we note in passing that for the extreme case @xmath412 , where @xmath413 , we have the exact ( regular at the horizon ) solutions , @xmath414 where @xmath415 is a constant .",
    "+ going back to ( [ aw01 ] ) , for any fixed @xmath46 , given the solution ( [ aw06 ] ) , a linearly independent solution is given by , @xmath416 where @xmath415 is a constant .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath417 is regular and non vanishing in @xmath418 , and , @xmath419 where @xmath340 and @xmath341 are constants .",
    "we may obtain and expansion of this solution in powers of @xmath62 using ( [ aw11 ] ) , or directly from ( [ aw01 ] ) , @xmath420 where we have set an arbitrary multiplicative constant so that the coefficient of @xmath382 is equal to one .",
    "for @xmath421 the integrals in ( [ aw11 ] ) can not be computed directly , because that would require explicit expressions for the zeros of polynomials of degree larger that 4 .",
    "we may , nevertheless , infer their general form as follows .",
    "we first notice that @xmath395 may be written in the form , @xmath422 where @xmath423 are the zeros of @xmath395 , which , as indicated are simple . therefore , since @xmath424 , we should have , @xmath425 where @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath415 , @xmath370 and @xmath426 are constants that depend on @xmath285 , @xmath73 , and @xmath423 . the last term in ( [ aw15 ] ) may be written in the form , @xmath427 where @xmath428 is a polynomial of order @xmath429 , or lower . replacing in ( [ aw11 ] ) , @xmath430",
    "but we notice that @xmath431 is a solution of ( [ aw01 ] ) , which can be singular only at the regular singular points @xmath70 , @xmath337 , and @xmath379 , and that the zeros @xmath423 do not coincide with these points .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath432 for all @xmath126 , and the last term in ( [ aw17 ] ) vanishes identically .",
    "this result implies that , for any @xmath46 , we may construct algebraically the solution ( [ aw11 ] ) as follows .",
    "we first compute the coefficients of @xmath395 as indicated above , and then replace in ( [ aw17 ] ) leaving @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath415 and the coefficients of @xmath433 arbitrary .",
    "next we replace in ( [ aw01 ] ) and impose the condition that @xmath355 is a solution of that equation , and that @xmath434 near @xmath70 .",
    "it can be checked that this procedure determines all the coefficients , up to an arbitrary multiplicative constant , a simple example being ( [ l2zvm ] ) for @xmath76 . since by construction these solutions satisfy the appropriate boundary condition at @xmath70 , the construction of the corresponding _ scalar _ zero modes , and the associated intertwining potential , is now a simple algebraic procedure .",
    "the resulting expressions are , unfortunately , very long and rather difficult to analyze in detail .",
    "in particular , we have not been able to show explicitly that for @xmath435 the scalar zero modes that satisfy the required boundary condition at @xmath70 are non vanishing everywhere in the interval @xmath60 , as required for the regularity of the intertwining potential .",
    "we remark , nevertheless , that this appears to be the case in all the particular solutions analyzed numerically after assigning definite numerical values for the parameters , as in the example described in section iii - c.    99 r.  j.  gleiser and g.  dotti , class.quant.grav.*23 * , 5063 ( 2006 ) [ arxiv : gr - qc/0604021 ] g.dotti , r. j. gleiser , j. pullin phys.lett .",
