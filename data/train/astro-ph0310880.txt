    "the sloan digital sky survey will provide us with the largest database of quasars in existence , over all cosmic epochs .",
    "therefore , we now need to find useful diagnostic tools in order to study these highly energetic phenomena at all redshifts .    various properties of quasars can now be investigated with their optical spectra alone . as discussed in this meeting ,",
    "these include orientation , dust composition , the accretion disk , the broad - line region , the narrow - line region and the black - hole masses . in this contribution",
    "we highlight the usefulness of the mgii emission - line doublet as a diagnostic of black - hole masses in quasars at @xmath1 and also as a means to determining an accurate systemic redshift for follow - up studies at other wavelengths .",
    "in recent years estimating black - hole masses has become somewhat easier than in the past .",
    "this is due to the large amount of work carried out on reverberation mapping of seyfert galaxies and quasars ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; and see peterson these proceedings ) and the correlation discovered by kaspi et al . between the radius of the broad - line region and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100 .",
    "if the velocity of the broad - line region gas can be measured along with the luminosity then the mass of the dominant gravitational mass can be estimated , assuming that the motion is virialised via , @xmath2 , where the velocity of the broad line region is usually derived from the fwhm of the broad - emission lines , traditionally h@xmath3 .    however , using this technique to estimate the masses of black holes in quasars at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) is difficult because h@xmath3 is redshifted out of the optical passbands and into the near - infrared where observations are much more difficult .",
    "therefore , to probe the high - redshift regime we need a proxy for h@xmath3 and @xmath5 in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum .",
    "an obvious choice for this proxy is mgii@xmath0 .",
    "mgii@xmath0 has a similar ionisation potential to that of h@xmath3 and thus we would expect that the line emission arises from a similar distance from the central ionising source .",
    "mgii is far enough in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum that it can be seen in optical spectra up to redshift @xmath6 .",
    "thus , calibrating the use of this line with h@xmath3 allows us to estimate black - hole masses over the majority of the age of the universe .",
    "a detailed account of calibrating mgii with h@xmath3 to estimate black - hole masses in quasars is given in mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) .",
    "we will only summarize this work here .",
    "the correlation between the radius of the broad - line region , @xmath7 , and the monochromatic luminosity at 3000 is given by ,    @xmath8^{(0.50\\pm0.02)}.\\ ] ]    this leads to ,    @xmath9    by compiling spectra covering both h@xmath3 and mgii of the reverberation mapped samples of wandel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) we are able to directly compare the uv virial black - hole mass estimate ( using mgii and monochromatic luminosity at 3000 ) and the traditional method using h@xmath3 . fig .",
    "1a shows that the fwhm(mgii ) closely follows the fwhm(h@xmath3 ) in these spectra , as expected if the lines are emitted from the same region .",
    "we can now use the virial estimator to calculate @xmath10 in quasars over all cosmic epochs using optical or near - infrared spectroscopy alone .",
    "this gives us sufficient numbers of objects to probe the black - hole masses in different populations of quasars , i.e. the radio - loud quasars and the radio - quiet quasars . in fig .",
    "2a we plot the black - hole masses derived from spectra of the large bright quasar survey [ lbqs ; hewett , foltz & chaffee ( 1995 ) ] , predominantly comprised of radio - quiet quasars and the molonglo quasar sample ( kapahi et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is a low - frequency radio selected sample .",
    "one can easily see how the radio - loud quasars almost exclusively lie to the top right of the plot , whereas the radio - quiet quasars from the lbqs stretch out across the full range of black - hole mass .",
    "therefore , there does seem to be evidence for the genuinely powerful ( @xmath11  w  hz@xmath12  sr@xmath12 ) radio - loud quasars to have black - holes confined to upper mass range of @xmath13 , in agreement with dunlop et al .",
    "flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars do not necessarily conform to this suggestion ( e.g. oshlack , webster & whiting 2002 ) , but this may be explained by the consideration of source geometry and doppler boosting of the radio - flux in these sources ( jarvis & mclure 2002 ; fig.2b ) .",
    "in addition to using mgii as a black - hole mass estimator in quasars , it can also be used to provide accurate quasar redshifts , which are important in various follow - up studies of the quasar host galaxies and the neutral gas within the epoch of reionization .",
    "recently walter et al .",
    "( 2003 ) have detected the presence of molecular gas in the quasar sdss j1148 + 5251 at @xmath14 .",
    "this kind of search is only efficient when relatively accurate redshifts are known due to the limited bandwidth of molecular line searches in the radio regime .",
    "accurate redshifts are also required to determine the fraction of neutral hydrogen to the foreground of the high - redshift @xmath15 quasars which exhibit the gunn - peterson trough ( becker et al .",
    "this is extremely difficult with lyman-@xmath16 alone due to the significant absorption blueward of the lyman-@xmath16 emission line .",
    "the accurate redshifts derived from mgii are relatively easy to obtain and thus , may be very important in future studies .",
