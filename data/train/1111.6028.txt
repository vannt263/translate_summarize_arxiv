    "spin excitations were not distinguished in the earlier experiments , because of resolution limitations of the instrumentation used .",
    "these limitations can be overcome in today s experimental setups , as has been demonstrated by the observation of spin excitations in other 1d  @xcite or 2d  @xcite cuprates and iridates ,  @xcite although rixs measurements for the simpler sr - based chain cuprates are still awaited .",
    "@xcite    the distinct form of the theoretical expression for the rixs cross section provides a unique way to study properties of models for one - dimensional condensed matter systems . the shortness of the intermediate state lifetime has been exploited to perform expansions for the magnetic indirect rixs cross section of mott insulators .",

    "it has been established experimentally that the character of excitations present in the final state of rixs depends strongly on the detuning from resonance .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to determine the effect of detuning on final state excitations in a generic model and see how it compares to the behavior of real systems .",
    "moreover , the effect of the intermediate - state core hole , which will play an increasingly important role with the advent of time - resolved rixs experiments , has been considered only heuristically so far .",

    "we use the lanczos method  @xcite to obtain the ground state of finite hubbard rings and then to evaluate the rixs cross section of eq .  . even though the rixs final state is translationally invariant , the intermediate - state hamiltonian @xmath45 , which is needed to evaluate the green s functions acting on the initial state , is not .",
    "translational invariance can thus not be used to reduce the fock space size and all results presented here are for 14-site rings .",

    "we have used lanczos exact diagonalization to explore signature features of the rixs response and its dependence on the remaining parameters of the hamiltonian describing the core hole potential and the energy of the incoming photon .",
    "the outcome of an indirect rixs process depends strongly on the resonance condition .",
    "calculation of the x - ray absorption ( xas ) spectrum for the hubbard model shows that there are two main resonances for indirect rixs :  @xcite one corresponds to intermediate states where the valence band at the core - hole site is doubly occupied and the core hole is therefore well - screened , at energies @xmath47 with respect to the initial state , and the other to states where the core - hole site is singly occupied and the core hole is poorly screened , at energies @xmath48 with respect to the initial state . in states with double occupancies at the core - hole sites , exchange interactions are not favorable and therefore spin excitations are not pronounced , whereas they are favored when core - hole sites are singly occupied .",

    "the form of the rixs scattering amplitude suggests that in direct rixs there can be processes where @xmath58 ( @xmath53 ) or @xmath59 ( @xmath54 ) . in a direct rixs experiment",
    "both processes take place . for a @xmath54 process to occur however , a spin - orbit interaction between the spin and angular degrees of freedom of the core hole is necessary ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rixs ] ) .",
    "hence , the weight ratio of the two direct rixs processes depends heavily on the strength of the core - hole spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the low - energy parts of the spectra for the two direct rixs processes are depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](b , c ) .",
    "it is seen that excitations in the low - energy part of the @xmath53 process spectrum are almost identical to those occurring in indirect rixs [ fig .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](a ) ] , although in this case they are caused by the decoupling of the intermediate state doublon into an antiholon and a spinon .",
    "the @xmath54 process spectrum is very similar to the spin dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath60 for the studied system , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](d - f ) , and corresponds mainly to single - magnon excitations .",
    "indeed , by setting @xmath61 , i.e. , by assuming an instantaneous rixs process with an infinitely fast decay of the core hole , @xmath60 is obtained exactly , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](f ) . the differences between @xmath60 and the @xmath54 direct rixs spectrum in figs .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](d , e ) are thus a direct consequence of the core hole s finite lifetime in the intermediate state .    the aforementioned differences between @xmath60 and the @xmath54 direct rixs spectrum consist of changes in the weight distribution along the brillouin zone , while the total weight remains constant , as will be shown below .",
    "even though the @xmath54 direct rixs spectrum may appear to be almost insensitive to the value of @xmath39 , the effect of a finite core - hole lifetime is actually important for the determination of the lineshape , even though the main excitation in a @xmath54 direct rixs process - namely the single magnon - does not depend on the presence of the core hole . on the contrary ,",
    "indirect and @xmath54 direct rixs processes depend crucially on core - hole properties ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the generic features of the spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin ] are similar to those found in linear spin - wave theory results ,  @xcite but they have more structure .",
    "for example , in @xmath62 direct rixs several peaks arise when moving towards the brillouin zone boundary , apart from the single peak of single - magnon excitations .",
    "also , the two - magnon spectral function is found to be finite at the zone boundary using spin - wave theory , but in figs .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](b , c ) we see that the @xmath63 direct rixs amplitude vanishes there .",
    "this means that two - magnon excitations at @xmath64 can arise only in @xmath62 direct rixs .",
    "our results are also consistent with numerical bethe ansatz calculations of dynamical spin and spin - exchange structure factors for the heisenberg model ,  @xcite which are the zero - lifetime limits of @xmath62 direct and indirect rixs processes respectively .",
    "the @xmath54 part of the direct rixs response is one order of magnitude larger than that of the @xmath53 process .",
    "this is because in the @xmath54 case there will be a magnon excitation in the final state even if no scattering with the core - hole potential occurs in the intermediate state . in the @xmath53 case ,",
    "at least two scatterings of electrons off the core - hole potential are needed for magnetic excitations to arise . in direct rixs , the incoming photon s angular momentum couples to the core electron s angular momentum , which is in turn coupled to the electron spin via spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this implies that it is in principle possible to alter the ratio of the two processes by appropriate choice of the incoming beam polarization and thus observe experimentally the respective change in the character of the spin excitations .",
    "an interesting feature seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rixs_spin](c ) is the difference between the one - magnon and the two - magnon peak locations .",
    "this difference decreases with increasing chain length and becomes zero for long chains .",
    "the fact that the two rixs responses scale differently with increasing system size is related to the different size of the excitations present in each case .",
    "it is noteworthy that experimental characterization of another quasi-1d cuprate , cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , suggests the presence of weakly coupled , finite - size chain segments , 13 - 14 copper sites in length .",
    "@xcite such an energy difference might thus reveal signatures of chain breaks , in addition to an analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility .",
    "@xcite if this is indeed the case , then our results show that this energy difference can be resolved in direct rixs experiments and can possibly be used to distinguish the different spin - excitation weights . before proceeding",

    "specific excitations can thus be favored or hindered .",
    "this is evident for example in the dependence of the total spin - excitation weight on @xmath66 around the xas peaks , as presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : weights_rixs_nocharge](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the momentum dependence of the charge sector excitations can be explained within a free particle - hole ( doublon - hole ) excitation picture and is very similar to the one obtained in electron energy - loss spectroscopy ( eels ) measurements .",
    "@xcite the energy - loss range of charge excitations in rixs becomes narrower with increasing momentum and the main peak shifts to higher energy loss .",
    "@xcite similar spectral shifts of charge excitation peaks are observed in numerical results for two - dimensional cuprates .",
    "@xcite a finite nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion @xmath70 is equivalent to an attraction between neighboring doublon - hole pairs and leads to a transfer of charge spectral weight to lower energies for all momenta .",
    "@xcite apart from this shift , the results presented in fig .  [ fig : weights_rixs_nocharge ] remain qualitatively unchanged for values of up to @xmath19 .",
    "it is noted that the maxima of absorption in figs .",
    "[ fig : weights_rixs_nocharge](a ) and ( b ) do not coincide exactly with the maxima of spin excitations .",
    "upon increasing the xas spectrum resolution , it is seen that the maximal rixs spin excitation response lies close to specific states within the broad peaks .",
    "therefore , in order to study the dependence of excitations on the core - hole potential strength , @xmath66 must be carefully selected in each case . for this purpose",

    "it is in principle possible to deduce the contribution of each of the two processes by comparing the momentum - dependence of the experimental spectrum lineshape ( with all geometrical factors stripped off ) to the lineshapes of figs .  [",
    "fig : rixs_spin](b , c ) .",
    "one can then compare with the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : corehole_pot ] and determine possible values for the core - hole potential and lifetime , which are typically considered as fit parameters .",
    "we note that this estimation scheme is general and therefore applicable to more complicated models , provided that the spin excitations can be clearly distinguished from other excitations , like e.g. @xmath4-@xmath4 excitations in multiple - orbital models .",
    "the spin - excitation weight for indirect rixs in fig .  [ fig : corehole_pot](a ) shows a dip around @xmath73 for both hubbard and extended hubbard models .",
    "this can be intuitively understood as follows : for these values of the core - hole potential , the attraction exerted by the core hole to an electron on a different site is approximately canceled by the effect of the on - site coulomb repulsion due to the electron already occupying the site with the core hole .",
    "there is therefore no cause for scattering and spin exchange processes are consequently suppressed .",
    "we find no such dip in @xmath63 direct rixs , a fact which demonstrates the different origin of the same excitations in the two rixs processes .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corehole_pot ] , the inclusion of a nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion with @xmath74 does not substantially alter spin - excitation weights .      it has been noticed in previous studies that the value of the intermediate state lifetime @xmath75 affects the weight of spin excitations in model calculations .",
    "@xcite the reason is that spin exchange processes are slow compared to charge excitations .",
    "this is indeed the case for indirect rixs . in direct rixs",
    "however , the single - spin flip is , as discussed above , a zero - order process in terms of electron  core -hole scattering , and the total excitation weight does therefore not depend on @xmath66 , @xmath39 or @xmath71 , even though the lineshape depends on these parameters , as is shown in figs  [ fig : rixs_spin](d - f ) for the case of @xmath39 .",
    "this implies that in direct rixs , evidence of single - spin excitations should be experimentally observable in 1d chain materials , as is the case at the cu @xmath76 edge in 2d cuprates  @xcite and in sr@xmath77cu@xmath78o@xmath79 .",
    "@xcite regarding the double spin - flip processes in rixs , the core - hole lifetime has been shown to be sufficient to detect such spin excitations in the case of the the cu @xmath3 edge in 2d cuprates .",
    "@xcite it is thus justified to assume that the intermediate - state lifetime is similarly long enough in chain systems , suggesting that spin excitations due to exchange interactions should be present in experimental rixs spectra .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corehole_pot](a - c ) , magnetic excitation weights remain unchanged for large ranges of @xmath71 , in both direct and indirect rixs . since it is very likely that the physical value of the core - hole attraction is within these ranges , the core - hole lifetime dependence of magnetic excitations shown in fig .",
