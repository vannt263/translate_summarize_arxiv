    "recent cosmological observations @xcite continue to provide strong evidence that the @xmath0cdm model is a reasonable approximation to the recent history of our universe .",
    "however , the true nature of the dominant term - the dark energy - remains one of the foremost problems in all of science today @xcite . with the emergence of at least three major players in current cosmology ; the cosmological constant @xmath0 ( or , perhaps , a refinement ) , spatial curvature @xmath3 and the matter @xmath4 ( dominated by the yet to be understood dark matter ) , the view that the history of our universe is best represented by a trajectory in phase space has become commonplace .",
    "indeed , many ( but notably not all @xcite ) analyses of the observations are now filtered through the @xmath0cdm model and reported by way of our current position in the @xmath5 - @xmath6 plane . here",
    "we use this phase space approach to completely solve the central problem in classical theoretical cosmology , the integration of the friedmann equation .",
    "this program is completed for all models consisting of an arbitrary number of non - interacting species and is accomplished through the algorithmic construction of a complete set of constants of the motion .",
    "these constants are to be considered as the fundamental characteristics of the model universes . in this approach",
    "the universe is viewed as a whole without reference to any particular class of observer .",
    "the question then naturally arises as to whether or not events in a given universe can be ordered globally without reference to any particular class of observer",
    ". this question is also explored by way of the construction of a gravitational epoch function .",
    "it is shown that such a function need not exist , but all observations strongly suggest that we live in a universe for which it does .",
    "we use the following notation : @xmath7 is the ( dimensionless ) scale factor and @xmath8 the proper time of comoving streamlines .",
    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath3 is the spatial curvature ( scaled to @xmath12 for @xmath13 and in units of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 signifies length ) ) , @xmath16 is the energy density and @xmath17 the isotropic pressure . @xmath0",
    "is the ( fixed ) effective cosmological constant and @xmath18 signifies current values . in currently popular notation ,",
    "the friedmann equation is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21    consider an arbitrary number of non - interacting separately conserved species so that @xmath22 with each species characterized by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant and distinct for each species .",
    "( in the real universe different species interact .",
    "the principal assumption made here is that these interactions are not an important effect . )",
    "the conservation equation now gives us @xmath25 where for each species @xmath26 is a constant .",
    "we can formally incorporate @xmath0 and @xmath3 into the sum ( [ rho ] ) by writing @xmath27 so that @xmath28 and @xmath29 so that @xmath30 and write ( [ omegatotal ] ) in the form @xmath31 where the sum it is now over all  species \" .",
    "since @xmath24 is assumed distinct for each species , there is no way to distinguish , say , lovelock @xcite ( _ i.e. _ geometric ) and vacuum contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "however , one can introduce an arbitrary number of separate species about the  phantom divide \" at @xmath32 .    if @xmath33 for species @xmath34 it follows that all the classical energy conditions hold @xcite for that species as long as @xmath35 the situation is summarized for convenience in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "it follows from ( [ cconstant ] ) that @xmath36 and writing @xmath37 @xcite , it also follows that @xmath38 as @xmath39 ( big bang or big crunch ) it follows that @xmath40 for all species except that with the largest @xmath41",
    ". then @xmath42 . as @xmath43 , @xmath40 for all species except that with the smallest @xmath44",
    ". then @xmath45 . from ( [ q ] ) and ( [ omegaz ] )",
    "it follows that the evolution of the universes considered are governed by the autonomous ( but non - linear ) system @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "we solve the system ( [ system ] ) algorithmically by way of the construction of a complete set of constants of the motion .",
    "consider all species or any subset thereof . to distinguish this latter possibility",
    "we replace @xmath34 by @xmath48 .",
    "a constant of the motion , defined globally over the history of a universe , and not with respect to any particular observer , is defined here to be a function @xmath49 for which @xmath50 consider the product @xmath51 where the exponents @xmath52 are constants .",
    "note that we do not make use of ( [ omegasum ] ) at this stage . for ( [ constant ] ) to hold for ( [ product ] ) , it follows from ( [ system ] ) that @xmath53 where @xmath54 if @xmath55 then according to ( [ constantmotion ] ) @xmath56 itself is a constant and so from ( [ system ] ) for each species the evolution is given by @xmath57 we do not consider this case further here . if @xmath56 is not constant then for @xmath58 of the form ( [ product ] ) to be a constant of the motion it follows from ( [ constantmotion ] ) that @xmath59 and the constant itself then reduces to @xmath60    sums , differences , products and quotients of constants of the motion are of course constants as well and so the range in @xmath48 must be examined .",
    "first consider two species , say @xmath61 .",
    "it then follows form ( [ vwconst ] ) that @xmath62 which is not possible as we require that the species be distinguished by @xmath63 .",
    "next suppose that @xmath48 ranges over more than three species .",
    "it now follows from ( [ vwconst ] ) that any such constant can be reduced to products and quotients of constants involving only three distinct species . as a result",
    "we need consider only those constants @xmath58 constructed from three distinct species which we now do .",
    "the trivial case is that of a universe for which there are only three species , say @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    ". then @xmath66 and since we can always choose @xmath67 , ( [ vwconst ] ) reduces to two equations in two unknowns .",
    "the constant of motion is then determined up to the choice in @xmath67 . for example , with dust we have the species @xmath68 and @xmath3 ( assumed @xmath69 @xcite , the @xmath0cdm model ) and it follows immediately that @xcite @xmath70 we can now substitute for @xmath71 from ( [ omegasum ] ) .    more generally , consider @xmath72 species , @xmath73 .",
    "if , say , species @xmath74 and @xmath75 are chosen to construct @xmath58 then there are @xmath76 choices for the remaining species , the number of independent constants of the motion .",
    "further , for example , there are @xmath77 dependent constants of motion that follow which involve @xmath74 but not @xmath75 . in any event , as with the case of only three species , since we can always specify one exponent , ( [ vwconst ] ) always reduces to two equations in two unknowns .",
    "as the foregoing algorithm makes clear , if species are added to a model , but none taken away , the constants of motion are _ inherited _ from the simpler model .",
    "for example , irrespective of what we add to the @xmath0cdm model , @xmath58 , given by ( [ dust ] ) , remains a constant of the motion .",
    "now consider evolution in a three dimensional subspace , say @xmath78 .",
    "we can construct the constant @xmath79 , and the constant @xmath80 where @xmath81 is any species other than @xmath82 or @xmath65 . then with ( [ omegasum ] )",
    "we replace @xmath83 .",
    "all species other than @xmath84 or @xmath65 that now enter are replace with the aide of constants constructed from that species and any two of @xmath84 and @xmath65 . in the subspace",
    "then we have two independent relations that relate @xmath78 .",
    "the intersection of these surfaces in the subspace defines the evolution trajectory of the associated universe in that subspace .    to amplify the foregoing , consider , for example , dust and radiation .",
    "we have the species @xmath85 and @xmath3 ( assumed @xmath69 ) . following the algorithm outlined above",
    "we immediately obtain the constants @xcite @xmath86    @xmath87    first note that the constant @xmath88 is _ inherited _ from the @xmath0cdm model as discussed above .",
    "moreover , only two of the above constants are independent . for example ,",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 . in , say , the @xmath85 subspace the history of a universe is obtained by the trajectory defined by the intersection of @xmath91 with one of the other constants and with @xmath71 replaced by @xmath92 in that constant @xcite .",
    "we end our discussion of constants of the motion here by noting that there are an infinite number of universes , of arbitrary complexity ( but containing the species @xmath68 and @xmath3 ) , for which @xmath93 throughout the entire history of the universe .",
    "the fact that we would appear to live in such a universe is a problem for some cosmologists - the  flatness problem \" .",
    "we take the view that this  problem \" arises only when too few species are considered , in the limit a two species model with only @xmath4 and @xmath3 , in order to put the issue in perspective .",
    "central to the discussion given above is the system ( [ system ] ) .",
    "we now discuss how this system can be used to make a fundamental distinction between model universes .",
    "in rigorous texts on general relativity , for example @xcite and @xcite , spacetime is defined ( in part ) as a time - oriented manifold .",
    "as stated in @xcite , time - oriented is often weakened simply to time - orientable , and as pointed out in @xcite , the local time orientation is , with guesswork , extrapolated to the universe as a whole . here",
    "we take a gravitational epoch function to be defined as a scalar field constructed from dimensionless ratios of invariants , each derivable from the riemann tensor without differentiation , such that the function is monotone throughout the history of the universe .",
    "the purpose of an epoch function is to allow the ordering of events without reference to any specific class of observers or , of course , coordinates . the existence of an epoch function , when unique , allows the rigorous time - orientation of an entire manifold without guesswork .",
    "this is why the existence of an epoch function is interesting .    in a conformally flat four dimensional spacetime",
    "the maximum number of independent scalar invariants derivable from the riemann tensor without differentiation is four .",
    "these are usually taken to be the ricci scalar @xmath94 at degree @xmath95 and the ricci invariants @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "( degree ( @xmath81 ) here means the number of tensors that go into the construction of the scalar .",
    "let @xmath98 signify the riemann tensor , @xmath99 the ricci tensor , @xmath94 the ricci scalar ( @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 the trace - free ricci tensor ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the ricci invariants are defined by ( the coefficients are of no physical consequence as they derrive from the spinor forms of the invariants ) : @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the kretschmann invariant , for example , is not used since @xmath106 in the conformally flat case . )",
    "the dimension of these invariants is @xmath107 . in a robertson - walker spacetime",
    "only two of these invariants are independent and in this spacetime it follows that @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath110 it is clear that @xmath111 given by ( [ ratio ] ) , or any monotone function thereof , is the only epoch function that can be constructed in a robertson - walker spacetime .",
    "universes can then be fundamentally categorized as to whether or not they admit monotone @xmath111 .    for convenience",
    "consider @xmath112 .",
    "it follows directly that in any robertson - walker spacetime @xmath113 whereas @xmath114 is defined through a bounce , its representation in the @xmath115 notation is not .",
    "this is of no concern here since we are concerned with the behaviour of @xmath114 strictly prior to any bounce should one exist . with the aide of ( [ system ] ) ,",
    "applied only to the species @xmath3 , it also follows that @xmath116 if we now apply the restriction ( [ barotropic ] ) and use the full set of equations ( [ system ] ) it follows that in addition to ( [ q ] ) @xmath117    let us again consider the @xmath0cdm model @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ epoch ] ) that @xmath118 and from ( [ epochprime ] ) and ( [ qprime ] ) that @xmath119 and finally from ( [ system ] ) applied to @xmath4 and @xmath0 that @xmath120 as a result , @xmath114 has a global minimum value of @xmath121 when @xmath122 the question then is , what @xmath0cdm models intersect the locus ( [ epochdustminimum ] ) and therefore fail to have @xmath114 monotone @xcite ?",
    "since @xmath123 clearly all @xmath0cdm models with @xmath1 admit the epoch function ( [ epochdust ] ) . now consider @xmath124 .",
    "for @xmath125 condition ( [ epochdustminimum ] ) holds at @xmath126 . for @xmath127 use ( [ epochdustminimum ] ) in ( [ dust ] ) to define @xmath128 with @xmath129",
    "choose a value of @xmath6 in the range @xmath130 and insert this value into ( [ dustintersection ] ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath131 ( which is negative ) is the constant of motion associated with the intersection of the associated integral curve with the locus ( [ epochdustminimum ] ) with the intersection taking place at the chosen value of @xmath6 . for @xmath132 choose a value of @xmath6 in the range @xmath133 and follow the foregoing procedure ( @xmath131 is now positive )",
    "however , with @xmath132 , as @xmath134 the constant @xmath131 reaches the lower bound of @xmath135 .",
    "there is then the range @xmath136 for which the associated integral curves do not intersect the locus ( [ epochdustminimum ] ) .",
    "we conclude then that for the @xmath0cdm models , all models with @xmath1 admit the epoch function ( [ epochdust ] ) , but for @xmath2 only those with @xmath132 and @xmath136 do .",
    "there is no evidence that our universe lies in this latter category .",
    "indeed , all the current evidence would suggest that we are very far away from it .",
    "we now make some general observations on the monotonicity of @xmath114 , but restricted to the case @xmath137 @xcite . in this case",
    "it follows from ( [ epochprime ] ) that the monotonicity of @xmath114 is closely associated with the monotonicity of @xmath56 . for example",
    ", if we assume that @xmath56 is monotone decreasing , then we can put a limit on the maximum @xmath63 allowed for a monotone @xmath114 . to do this note that for models with a big bang the initial value of @xmath56 is @xmath138 where @xmath139 signifies the largest value of @xmath63 ( assumed @xmath140 ) for all species .",
    "it follows from ( [ epochprime ] ) then that @xmath114 can be monotone only for @xmath141 . in view of ( [ energy ] ) this is a rather surprising restriction , but one which is in accord with all observations .",
    "a complete set of constants of the motion has been constructed for all flrw models consisting of an arbitrary number of separately conserved species , each with a constant ratio of pressure to density .",
    "these constants of the motion are to be considered as the fundamental characteristics of the model universes .",
    "the unique candidate for a gravitational epoch function has been constructed for all flrw models . in the simplest of all models , the @xmath0cdm model",
    ", it has been shown that the epoch function exists for all models with @xmath1 , for no models with @xmath142 , and for almost no models with @xmath2 .",
    "this function allows the global ordering of events without reference to any particular class of observers or , of course , coordinates .      [",
