    "<S> the energy surfaces are plotted numerically from the known analytic solution . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting energy landscape consists of an infinite stack of sheets connected by conical intersection points located at the degenerate juddian points in the eigenspectrum . </S>",
    "<S> trajectories encircling these points are expected to exhibit a nonzero geometric phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the driven , biased or generalised rabi model has hamiltonian @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pauli matrices for a two - level system with level splitting @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the spin and the single - mode bosonic field of frequency @xmath4 is via the coupling @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the bosonic creation and destruction operators @xmath6 and @xmath7 satisfy @xmath8 = 1 $ ] . the rabi model is well known as arguably the simplest model for light interacting with matter . as such , it has a long history in quantum optics . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the driving or bias term @xmath9 breaks a @xmath10 symmetry ( parity ) . </S>",
    "<S> this additional term allows tunnelling between the two atomic states . </S>",
    "<S> the driven rabi model ( [ ham ] ) is relevant to the description of various hybrid mechanical systems @xcite . in particular , of a micromechanical resonator via coupling to a cooper - pair box @xcite .    using the analytic solution obtained by braak @xcite for the energy eigenspectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the energy levels of this model as a function of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the @xmath12th eigenvalue is given by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the @xmath12th zero of @xmath15 where @xmath16 @xmath17 is defined recursively by @xmath18 with initial conditions @xmath19 , and @xmath20 the function @xmath21 is obtained as a consistency condition for two different series expansions in a representation of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the bargmann space of analytical functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be derived using the extended coherent states approach @xcite and written in terms of confluent heun functions . </S>",
    "<S> the eigenstates have also been obtained in terms of confluent heun functions @xcite .     for parameter values @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> from left to right , @xmath24 and 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for parameter values @xmath22 and @xmath23 . from left to right , @xmath24 and 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]   for parameter values @xmath22 and @xmath23 . from left to right , @xmath24 and 1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the lowest energy levels are shown in figure 1 as a function of @xmath5 for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath11 . for @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> this is the well known plot featuring the juddian crossing points @xcite for which kus @xcite provided a proof that for each value of @xmath12 there are @xmath12 crossings if @xmath3 is in the range @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> more generally for @xmath27 there are @xmath28 crossing points @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are also such crossing points in the eigenspectrum when @xmath11 is an integer multiple of @xmath29 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown in figure 1 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been argued that for a given value of @xmath12 there are @xmath12 level crossings for @xmath32 , reducing to @xmath28 crossing points for @xmath3 in the range @xcite , so this relation holds in general with @xmath11 replaced by @xmath33 . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath34    here we explore the energy landscape as a function of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath11 for fixed @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , the effect of varying the parameter @xmath11 is to induce conical intersection points . </S>",
    "<S> the tips of the cones are precisely the degenerate juddian points . </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 shows the structure of the interconnected energy surfaces as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath11 for @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure should be viewed in conjunction with figure 1 , which gives the cross - sections at @xmath35 of the energy landscape shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure also shows crossing points for @xmath36 as the parameter @xmath11 is varied . </S>",
    "<S> these are determined by the energies @xmath37 two more refined views of the energy surfaces are shown in figure 3 . on the @xmath38-axis which has the effect of turning the paraboloids into planes . ] </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the energy surfaces for @xmath39 are connected by isolated conical intersection points . </S>",
    "<S> these are shown further in figure 4 , which illustrates the elementary cones .     and @xmath11 for the values @xmath22 and @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the landscape consists of a series of discrete sheets labelled by integer @xmath12 and connected by conical intersection points for @xmath40 . ]         with @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the plot on the left shows the `` lowest '' cones at @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is a magnification of the cone centred at @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]   with @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the plot on the left shows the `` lowest '' cones at @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is a magnification of the cone centred at @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the overall structure of the energy landscape is an infinite stack of sheets labelled by integers @xmath43 connected for @xmath44 by conical intersection points for @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the conical intersection points are the exceptional points in the eigenspectrum which are located on lines in the planes defined by @xmath45 , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> these lines are the intersections of the surfaces @xmath47 and @xmath48 for different @xmath49 with @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the precise locations of the conical intersection points along these lines are determined by the solutions of the constraint relations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their number is dependent on the value of @xmath51 . from the above consideration of the number of crossing points </S>",
    "<S> , the number of conical intersection points can be tabulated for given @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this sense the precise geometry of the energy landscape is thus known . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the value @xmath22 considered in the figures , there are @xmath12 conical intersection points for a given value of @xmath12 located in each of the planes where @xmath45 , @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 identifies the most elementary of the cones , with a magnification of the cone centred at @xmath25 . from the general result ( [ cross ] ) for the number of crossing points we know that this particular cone vanishes for @xmath53 .    </S>",
    "<S> trajectories encircling conical intersection points are expected to exhibit a nonzero geometric phase . </S>",
    "<S> geometric phases @xcite have been investigated in the context of the rabi model for some time , and not without debate ( see , e.g. , refs . @xcite and references therein ) . for systems like the rabi model </S>",
    "<S> the berry phase is induced by integration over a unitary transformation parameter @xmath54 with the angle variable @xmath54 varying slowly from @xmath55 to @xmath56 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we have demonstrated conical intersection points in the energy landscape for the driven rabi model by varying the system parameters @xmath5 and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> since analytic expressions for the corresponding eigenstates are known for this model , the geometric phases obtained by integrating trajectories encircling the conical points should , in principle , be calculable .    as a final remark </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the original justification for studying juddian points was that , because they were exact solutions , they could be useful in testing and improving various approximation schemes . here , using the analytic solution of the driven rabi model </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the degenerate juddian points are the conical intersection points in the energy landscape . </S>",
    "<S> degenerate juddian points exist in a range of models related to the rabi model . </S>",
    "<S> it is hoped that these models can be added to the different contexts in which conical intersection points have been observed . </S>",
    "<S> the conical intersection points are expected to play a crucial role in the dynamics of the driven rabi model , which is as yet only partially @xcite explored .    </S>",
