    "<S> common intuition tells that , due to thermal agitation , symmetries are restored when a system is heated up . </S>",
    "<S> this can be physically understood as due to thermal excitations , which make possible for the system to cross the barrier surrounding the broken minimum and feel the full symmetry of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> this type of behaviour can be parametrized by means of a temperature dependent effective potential which is computable order by order in perturbation theory and displays the whole symmetry of the theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the behaviour at high temperature of systems with symmetries was formally studied in the 70 s by applying the techniques of finite temperature field theory . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry restoration was generally found for both global [ 1 ] and gauge symmetries [ 2 , 3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is , for example , the situation concerning the standard model with one higgs doublet .    as counterintuitive as it may seem </S>",
    "<S> , one wonders whether it is possible to find the opposite behaviour : a broken symmetry which gets more broken at high temperature , or even the more radical situation where an unbroken symmetry gets broken at high temperature [ 3 , 4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> weinberg [ 3 ] has already pointed out such a behaviour in a two higgs multiplet model </S>",
    "<S> . he also mentions a beautiful experimental example borrowed from solid state physics : a ferroelectric crystal , the rochelle salt , which presents a certain temperature region where an unbroken symmetry gets broken at high temperature , though as the temperature is further increased the symmetry becomes eventually restored [ 5 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> most extensions of the standard cosmological big bang model are still afflicted from problems concerning so - called topological defects ( domain walls , monopoles ) which are supposed to be produced during phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry non - restoration ( snr ) could provide a radical cure to this problem [ 6 ] , avoiding phase transitions at all and therefore the generation of topological deffects .    at present , there are two main avenues to explore physics beyond the standard model : theories in which the higgs particle is a fundamental one , supersymmetry being its most relevant example and those for which the higgs it is not , and a non - perturbative regime is appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that internal symmetries are always restored for renormalizable supersymmetric theories [ 7 ] . for the latter , </S>",
    "<S> a recent analysis for systems involving non - vanishing background charges shows that snr could be possible [ 8 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the case of non - renormalizable theories has been discussed in [ 9 ] .    to illustrate the possibility of snr in gauge theories </S>",
    "<S> , we use a simple model given by a two higgs doublet model with a @xmath0 local symmetry . a general renormalizable scalar potential having this symmetry is written as @xmath1 , @xmath2 are scalar fields and dots represent terms that are not relevant for this problem . temperature corrections to the potential </S>",
    "<S> are readily obtained at one - loop level in the high temperature limit ( @xmath3 ) [ 10 ] with the result , @xmath4 . \\label{v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once the boundedness conditions are satisfied , the contribution from both fermions and gauge bosons is positive , tending to restore the symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the only possible source of snr is therefore provided by the scalar sector of the theory . studying ( [ v ] ) we have found that snr is possible whenever the following condition is satisfied , @xmath5    that is , since @xmath6 is already of order one , some of the _ scalar couplings _ have to be negative and _ greater than one in absolute value _ , going out of the perturbative regime , where the approach can not be trusted any longer . to bypass this problem </S>",
    "<S> we explore this non - perturbative region using a chiral lagrangian approach for a theory with a strongly interacting higgs sector .    </S>",
    "<S> the ungauged chiral lagrangian can be written , @xmath7 , \\label{chl}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to convince oneself that ( [ chl ] ) is @xmath9 invariant . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of lagrangians are frequently used to describe pion interactions in qcd at low energies ( @xmath10 gev ) [ 11 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most beautiful features of this approach is its universality , in the sense that the same lagrangian can be used to describe all theories that show the same pattern of symmetry breaking ( e.g. @xmath11 ) , the only change being the different values of the only dimensional parameter of the lagrangian , @xmath12 , which is about @xmath13 mev for qcd and @xmath14 gev for the electroweak theory .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows a clear tendency towards chiral symmetry restoration confirming previous results [ 12 ] , although it is important to keep in mind that an exact number for the critical temperature can not be obtained with this technique which is only valid for @xmath15 .    </S>",
    "<S> now we would like to construct , starting from ( [ chl ] ) , a locally ( gauge ) @xmath16 invariant chiral lagrangian , @xmath17+{\\cal   l}_{ym}+{\\cal l}_{gf } + { \\cal l}_{fp } ,   \\label{gcl}\\ ] ] where the covariant derivative is given by @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is the pure yang - mills lagrangian , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the gauge - fixing and faddeev - popov terms [ 13 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the temperature behavior of a strongly interacting higgs system . using a gauged chiral lagrangian we have found that there are no temperature dependent gauge corrections at one loop : the tendency towards symmetry restoration observed in the ungauged case </S>",
    "<S> is then mantained . </S>",
    "<S> the computation of gauge corrections at two loops is still in progress . </S>",
    "<S> although the results presented here are for a @xmath16 gauge symmetry , we are currently studying a theory with the standard model gauge symmetry , @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the model dependence , i.e. different symmetry breaking sectors of the theory ( technicolor , sm ... ) , is also being studied .    </S>",
