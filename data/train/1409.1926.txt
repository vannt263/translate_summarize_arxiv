    "we first introduce the formalism used to characterize broadband states of light and their statistical mixtures over a finite normalization volume @xmath138 .",

    "is then described by @xmath149where @xmath22 is the vacuum state , and it is easy to confirm that @xmath150 . beyond the normalization condition , the spectral distribution @xmath145 could in principle be completely general .",
    "we create a statistical mixture of states @xmath151 summing over states with different parameters @xmath144 : @xmath152 with the probability distribution @xmath153 fulfilling @xmath154 .",
    "the label `` dis '' refers to the fact that the wave vector @xmath141 only takes discrete values here .",
    "the states can be expanded in the spectral - fock basis @xmath155 in which the elements of the density matrix for our mixture read : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a positive real number , and @xmath158 .",
    "given a state @xmath144 , if the phases @xmath159 and @xmath160 of two different modes are independent from one another and uniformly distributed over the wave vector @xmath141 , then the exponential in ( [ eq : density - matrix_general ] ) will be non - zero iff @xmath161 for each @xmath141 .",
    "in other words , the only non - zero terms in the density matrix will be those fulfilling @xmath162 for each mode , resulting in a diagonal density matrix in the spectral - fock basis .",
    "however , such states will not correspond to localized pulses .",
    "a state that corresponds to a localized pulse ( within the normalization volume ) can be constructed by imposing a phase relation between the different modes .",
    "this is true in particular for a widely - used class of pulses for which the phase of different modes has a linear relationship of the form @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is a real constant and @xmath165 is a vector ( see e.g. , bradley and new @xcite ) ; two pulses differing only by their values of @xmath166 and @xmath167 are identical , except for different phase factors and different locations of their centres .",
    "we interpret a sum over all possible pulses as a sum over all possible combinations of all possible amplitudes and phases .",

    "the density matrix element can now be written as : @xmath172 for a uniform distribution of @xmath166 and @xmath167 , the sum over @xmath144 will be non - zero only for @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "this will certainly restrict the elements @xmath175 that can be nonzero , but it is hardly enough to impose `` mode incoherence , '' which we define to be the condition @xmath175 vanishes unless @xmath176 individually for all @xmath141 and all @xmath142 .",
    "this mode incoherence is a necessary condition for the density matrix to represent thermal light .",
    "the situation is not significantly improved if we move beyond a linear phase relation .",
    "any _ finite _ expansion of @xmath177 to order @xmath178 in @xmath141 will impose more restrictions ( of the form @xmath179 ) that characterize the non - vanishing elements of @xmath175 , but this set is far from the set of restrictions necessary to specify mode incoherence .",
    "hence the density matrix characterizing the kind of mixture we have considered here can always be expected to have coherences between photon number states , and thus not represent thermal light .",
    "the previous argument can be illustrated by a concrete example .",
    "for this purpose , consider the basis states @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "we specifically choose @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 for reasons that will become clear below . with no restriction on possible phases ,",
    "the off - diagonal element @xmath185 reads : @xmath186    we now impose a linear restriction on the phase , and choose the three occupied modes such that @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",

    "<S> importantly , @xmath79 scales as @xmath1 , and so certainly @xmath80 , since @xmath81 , independent of the volume .  </S>",
    "<S> yet one might hope that the trace - improper mixture could lead to a correct representation of _ some _ of the properties of thermal light , if @xmath82 and the spectral functions @xmath83 and amplitudes @xmath14 are chosen correctly .  </S>",
    "<S> we next show that this is possible for the first - order correlation functions .  here </S>",
    "<S> it is convenient to let the volume @xmath59 in ( [ rhoimp ] ) at the start . </S>",
    "<S> then we wish to show that with a correct choice of @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath14 we can find   @xmath84where the integral of @xmath13 now ranges over all space , such that @xmath85which we refer to as the simulation condition  we wish @xmath5 to satisfy .     </S>",

    "<S> is then to see if @xmath101 can be chosen so that our simulation condition ( [ simulation ] ) is guaranteed .  </S>",
    "<S> we begin by considering pulses of a gaussian form , @xmath103 with the associated required normalization condition @xmath91 .  </S>",
    "<S> for thermal radiation at @xmath104  k we find that the simulation condition ( [ simulation ] ) can be guaranteed only if @xmath105 is chosen so that the pulse has a bandwidth on the order of thz or smaller , describing pulses that are on the order of picoseconds in length or longer .  </S>",
    "<S> details are given in chenu et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , no physical solution can be found for femtosecond pulses with a bandwidth as broad as the thermal spectrum .  </S>",
    "<S> the problem is that the gaussian shape ( [ gaussian ] ) differs too much from the shape required to guarantee that the norm of the integrand of ( thermal1 ) is reproduced .  </S>",
    "<S> thus the only way that we can satisfy ( simulation ) is to choose @xmath105 so small that , compared with the thermal spectrum , @xmath92 is essentially proportional to a dirac delta function ; then @xmath101 itself is relied on to capture the shape of that integrand .    to satisfy ( [ simulation ] ) with broadband pulses we can work instead with a set of parameters @xmath18 that includes only a nominal direction of propagation of the pulse @xmath106 , as well as a polarization vector @xmath88 as before , @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> note now that @xmath78 is dimensionless whereas @xmath82 has dimension of @xmath108 .  </S>",
    "<S> we take our pulses ( [ kdef ] ) to be specified by @xmath109where the function @xmath110 is chosen to characterize the spread in the direction of wave vectors in the pulse and should be peaked at @xmath111 for @xmath106 to indicate the nominal direction of propagation of the pulse ; the function @xmath112 is now relied on to help capture the shape of the norm of the integrand of ( [ thermal1 ] ) ; note that again the pulses are all divergenceless . for our weight function </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 we assume that the @xmath106 are distributed isotropically and , for each @xmath106 , all @xmath88 perpendicular to @xmath106 are equally distributed,@xmath113where @xmath114 is now a constant with units of @xmath115 $ ] , @xmath116 indicates an integration over solid angle , and @xmath117 denotes the angle @xmath88 makes from a fixed direction in the plane perpendicular to @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> we show @xcite that such a trace - improper mixture can lead to ( [ simulation ] ) by choosing @xmath118where @xmath119 is the riemann - zeta function ; and we also provide a full characterization of such pulses . by comparing ( [ thermal1 ] ) and ( [ lresult ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the bandwidth of the pulse helps capture that of the thermal radiation .    </S>",
    "<S> the requirement of a fixed product @xmath120 illustrates that the need for improper behavior as @xmath4 can be met either by the trace or by the pulses . in the example of a density operator @xmath121 we have been considering </S>",

    "<S> the preceding two examples show that although a trace - improper mixture of pulses is not described by the same density operator as thermal light , such a mixture can be constructed to reproduce the first - order correlation function of thermal light .  </S>",

    "<S> the full expression is given elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , beyond a distance of about @xmath134 for @xmath104 k , the second - order correlation function is independent of both the distance @xmath124 and the orientation of that vector with respect to the cartesian axis @xmath48 , @xmath135clearly , in the presence of thermal light there is a non - zero probability of simultaneous broadband detection events occurring regardless of the distance between the two detectors .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ]     we have not been able to evaluate the second - order correlation function for @xmath121 analytically . </S>",
    "<S> however , since each member of our family of pulses is localized in space  </S>",
    "<S> i.e. it can essentially be contained entirely within a volume centred at its origin  </S>",
    "<S> each individual pulse will not be able to simultaneously excite two detectors if at least one of them is outside this volume . although our mixture is trace - improper , it is composed of an incoherent mixture of localized pulses ( _ cf . _ eq .  [ rhoimp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the total probability should equal the sum of the individual realizations , and we expect our argument to apply to the mixture as well . </S>",

    "<S> returning to a finite observation volume @xmath1 and the use of a unit - trace density operator representing a mixture of pulses with @xmath136 proportional to @xmath1 , from the arguments above we see that such a density operator would have no chance of describing the second - order correlation function properly if the observation volume were significantly larger than the size of the pulses . for </S>",
