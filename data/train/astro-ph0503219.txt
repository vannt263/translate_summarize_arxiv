    "to generate and evolve stellar populations until double compact - object formation occurs , we use the _ startrack _ code first developed by belczynski , kalogera , and bulik ( 2002 ) [ hereafter bkb ] and recently significantly updated and tested as described in detail in @xcite . as with all binary population synthesis codes ,",

    "as described in oshaughnessy , kalogera , and belczynski ( 2004 ) [ hereafter denoted okb ] , the archive was generated using flat probability distributions for seven of the most significant parameters : three parameters describing the supernova kick magnitude distribution ( assumed to consist of two maxwellian distributions with dispersions @xmath4$]km / s and @xmath5$]km / s and relative weight of small to large kicks @xmath6 $ ] ) ; the effective common - envelope efficiency @xmath7 $ ] ; the stellar wind strength @xmath8 $ ] ; the power - law index controlling the distribution of the mass of the companion relative to the mass of the primary @xmath9 $ ] ; and the fraction of mass accreted ( as opposed to lost from the binary ) during non - conservative mass transfer episodes @xmath10 $ ] . unfortunately ,",
    "as discussed in more detail in @xcite , we can not succinctly describe the effect of these seven parameters on the formation channels and rates of bh - ns systems ; physical predictions depend in a _",
    "highly correlated way on all seven parameters_. as in okb , we fixed the remaining population synthesis model parameters to physically reasonable values , such as setting the maximum neutron star mass to @xmath11 and the metallicity to solar metallicity @xmath12 ( see parameters of model a in  bkb for more details ) . from this archive we identified each merging bh - ns binary along with the details of its evolutionary history .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tab : main ] .",
    "compact binaries tight enough to merge through the emission of gravitational waves within the hubble time have progenitors which usually interacted strongly ( e.g. through mass transfer ) earlier in their evolution .",
    "for example , a common mode of interaction is conventional mass transfer through roche - lobe overflow and disk accretion .",
    "however , for merging bh - ns binaries , we find in our simulations that almost all of them have experienced a more dramatic phase of dynamically unstable mass transfer and common envelope ( ce ) evolution ( see table  [ tab : main ] ) . during such phases",
    "it is expected that _ hypercritical _",
    "accretion becomes possible . in this form of accretion ( hce ) , discussed in more detail in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , a compact object spirals in through the envelope of its companion , rapidly accreting matter at highly super - eddington ( for photons ) , neutrino - cooled rates . as a result of this process , most of the companion s envelope is ejected , bringing the post - ce binary very close together . while the detailed accretion onto the compact object is complex and ill - understood , since we know the whole envelope will be lost during this phase , a straightforward application of the conservation of energy and mass during the quasicircular spiral - in process can determine the final orbit , the final binary masses , and the mass of the ejected material ; see appendix a of @xcite for details .",

    "black holes form either immediately after the first core - collapse event or through the accretion - induced collapse of a ns that forms in the first supernova event . regardless of the nature of the first compact object ( bh or ns ) ,",
    "it most typically experiences hce evolution , and accretes a large amount of matter ( potentially equal to its birth mass ) during the brief hce phase .",
    "figure  [ fig : dm ] shows the fraction of the initial compact object s mass @xmath22 that is accreted during the hce phase .",
    "based on the sample we have , we estimate an upper bound on the fractional mass accreted as a function of the initial mass to be @xmath23 this bound is valid for all channels . for systems which form their bh immediately after the first supernova",
    "( i.e. , no accretion - induced collapse , so @xmath24 ) we find an empirical _ lower _ bound of @xmath25 this latter bound may be understood as a requirement that the bh - ns system merge within the simulation time .",

    "a of @xcite ( with any choice for @xmath27 ) , we find this requirement approximately translates into the lower bound presented above .",
    "merging bh - ns can form through other channels , as shown in table  [ tab : main ] . however , these channels involve substantially less mass transfer onto the bh : for the hce - related channels , the _ smallest _ mass increase was @xmath28 , to be contrasted with the _ largest _ disk - mediated mass transfer , @xmath29 ( i.e. , from the channel snx+mt+sny ) .",

    "moreover , even if each model contributed equally to the total number of bh - ns systems , our net numbers would then reflect the _ mean branching ratios _ over all population synthesis models considered , rather than the branching ratio of , e.g. , the most common model . finally , as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "not all population synthesis models we considered are equally compatible with observations . nonetheless given the current statistics , we fully expect that most bh - ns systems will form via a hypercritical common envelope phase .     for systems that undergo hce evolution ( see table  [ tab : main ] ) , this plot shows @xmath30 versus @xmath31 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the mass of the bh progenitor just after its supernovae and at the end of its evolution , respectively .",

    "our current understanding of this spin - up process is quite limited .",

    "these pulsars are believed to have been spun up during a ce phase ( where collapse to a bh was avoided though ) and it is evident that they are not spinning close to break - up : the fastest known pulsar in a double ns binary is psr j0737 - 3039a spinning at @xmath43ms or else having @xmath44 @xcite .",

    "further , if young protoneutron stars can spin down rapidly through other mechanisms , such as r - modes @xcite , straightforward electromagnetic - based extrapolations may significantly underestimate the protoneutron star spin .",

    "black hole x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) offer the possibility of _ directly _ measuring the spin of a compact object , since they involve a highly relativistic accretion flow in the strong field of a bh .",
    "two techniques are prominent in the literature : interpreting quasiperiodic oscillations and fitting iron line profiles .",
    "quasiperiodic oscillations are believed to be modes of the inner , highly relativistic regions of the bh accretion disk .",

    "moreover , evidence suggests the spin suggested by these measurements is _ not _ merely a relic of past accretion .",

    "in this paper we perform population synthesis calculations to track the history of systems which evolve into merging bh - ns binaries , demonstrating that these objects form through only a few channels , almost exclusively involving a hypercritical common envelope ( hce ) phase and often involving accretion induced collapse of a ns into a bh .",
    "we show that a significant amount of mass is typically accreted during this hce phase . using _ an upper limit based on thin - disk accretion _ , we find the bhs accrete enough matter to potentially spin up to large @xmath45 values , independent of the bh birth spin .",
    "finally , we note the observed sample of neutron stars suggests the birth spins of the black holes in these binaries should be small ; therefore , the bh spins in bh - ns binaries should arise almost entirely from the matter they accrete in a hce phase .",
    "unfortunately , the hce phase is poorly understood . while our result is a first step of a program to better understand the expected bh spins for those systems ligo and other gravitational - wave detectors could observe , more simulations of these processes",
    "are needed to obtain firmer conclusions .",
    "further , based on our rough understanding of the range of expected spin magnitude , and using the expected effect of spin on gw detection drawn from @xcite , we demonstrated that neglecting spin in gw searches should only moderately reduce the detection rate .",
    "however , our analysis was based on the work of @xcite , which like many papers in the gravitational - wave literature assumed all bhs in bh - ns binaries had @xmath88 . in fact , based on our calculations we expect ( i ) the mass ratio can vary , and should be biased towards larger values ( i.e. , closer to @xmath89 than @xmath90 ) ; and ( ii ) the sample of bh - ns binaries should show strong correlations between mass ratio and spin magnitude , because higher - mass bhs are harder to spin up .",
    "we hope to undertake a more thorough monte carlo study of the effect of various expected distributions for bh spin magnitude , spin tilt , and bh - ns mass ratio in a future paper .",
    "finally we note that in our simulations we consider only bh - ns in the galactic field ; we do not account for any stellar interactions relevant to centers of globular clusters and similar dense environments .",
    "if bh - ns binaries form in significant numbers in cluster centers , then their spin properties could be entirely unrelated to the analysis presented in this study .",

    "we particularly thank our anonymous referee for extensive comments and suggestions regarding the xrb literature .",

    "<S> as a first step towards understanding the angular momentum evolution history of black holes in merging black - hole / neutron - star binaries , we perform population synthesis calculations to track the distribution of accretion histories of compact objects in such binaries . we find that there are three distinct processes which can possibly contribute to the black - hole spin magnitude : a birth spin for the black hole , imparted at either ( i ) the collapse of a massive progenitor star to a black hole or ( ii ) the accretion - induced collapse of a neutron star to a black hole ; and ( iii ) an accretion spin - up when the already formed black hole [ via ( i ) or ( ii ) ] goes through an accretion episode ( through an accretion disk or a common - envelope phase ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that , with regard to accretion - induced spinup in merging bh - ns binaries [ method ( iii ) above ] , only _ accretion episodes associated with common - envelope phases and hypercritical accretion rates _ occur in the formation history of merging black hole / neutron star binaries . lacking unambiguous experimental information about bh birth spins [ i.e. , </S>",
    "<S> regarding the results of processes ( i ) and ( ii ) ] , we choose two fiducial values for the bh birth angular momentum parameter @xmath0 , consistent with observations of ( i ) ns birth spins ( @xmath1 ) and ( ii ) x - ray binaries ( @xmath2 ) . using these two fiducial values and a conservative upper bound on the specific angular momentum of accreted matter </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the expected range of black hole spins in the binaries of interest . </S>",
