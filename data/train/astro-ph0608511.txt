    "several years ago , the author presented an information geometric approach to modelling a space of perturbations of the random state for galactic clustering and cosmological void statistics  @xcite .",
    "the present note is intended to update somewhat and draw attention to this approach as a possible contribution to the interpretation of the data from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , cf croton et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the classical random model is that arising from a poisson process of mean density @xmath0 galaxies per unit volume in a large box .",
    "then , in a region of volume @xmath1 the probability of finding exactly @xmath2 galaxies is @xmath3 so the probability that the given region is devoid of galaxies is @xmath4 it follows that the probability density function for the continuous random variable @xmath5 in the poisson case is @xmath6 in practice of course , measurements will depend on algorithms that specify threshold values for density ranges of galaxies in cells and the lowest range will represent the ` underdense ' regions which include the voids ; benson et al .",
    "@xcite discuss this .",
    "a hierachy of @xmath7-point correlation functions needed to represent clustering of galaxies in a complete sense was devised by white  @xcite and he provided explicit formulae , including their continuous limit .",
    "in particular , he made a detailed study of the probability that a sphere of radius @xmath8 is empty and showed that formally it is symmetrically dependent on the whole hierarchy of correlation functions .",
    "however , white concentrated his applications on the case when the underlying galaxy distribution was a poisson process , the starting point for the present approach which is concerned with geometrizing the parameter space of departures from a poisson process .",
    "croton et al .",
    "@xcite found that the negative binomial model for galaxy clustering gave a very good approximation to the 2dfgrs , pointing out that this model is a discrete version of the gamma distribution .",
    "for a general account of large - scale structures in the universe , see fairall  @xcite .",
    "kauffmann and fairall  @xcite developed a catalogue search algorithm for larger nearly spherical regions devoid of bright galaxies and obtained a spectrum for radii of significant voids .",
    "this indicated a peak radius near 4 @xmath9 a long tail stretching at least to 32 @xmath9 and is compatible with the recent extrapolation models of baccigalupi et al  @xcite which yield an upper bound on void radii of about 50 @xmath10 this data has of course omitted the expected very large numerical contribution of smaller voids .",
    "more recent work , notably of croton et al .",
    "@xcite provide much larger samples with improved estimates of void size statistics and benson et al .",
    "@xcite gave a theoretical analysis in anticipation of the 2dfgrs survey data , including the evaluation of the void and underdense probability functions .",
    "hoyle and vogeley  @xcite provided detailed results for the statistics of voids larger than 10 @xmath11 in the 2dfgrs survey data ; they concluded that such voids constitute some @xmath12 of the universe and have a mean radius of about 15 @xmath10    the count density @xmath13 of galaxies observed in zones using a range of sampling schemes each with a fixed zone volume @xmath5 results in a decreasing variance @xmath14 of count density with increasing zone size , roughly of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is some characteristic scaling parameter .",
    "this monotonic decay of variance with zone size is a natural consequence of the monotonic decay of the covariance function , roughly isotropically and of the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is some characteristic scaling parameter of the order of magnitude of the diameter of filament structures ; this was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "then @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the probability density of finding two points separated by distance @xmath21 independently and at random in a zone of volume @xmath22 the power spectrum using , say , cubical cells of side lengths @xmath8 is given by the family of integrals @xmath23    fairall  @xcite ( page 124 ) reported a value @xmath24 for the ratio of variance @xmath25 to mean squared @xmath26 for counts of galaxies in cubical cells of unit side length .",
    "in other words , the coefficient of variation for sampling with cells of unit volume is @xmath27 and this is dimensionless .",
    "we choose a family of parametric statistical models for void volumes that includes the random model  ( [ negexp ] ) as a special case .",
    "there are of course many such families , but we take one that a recent theorem  @xcite has shown contains neighbourhoods of all departures from randomness and it has been successful in modelling void size distributions in terrestrial stochastic porous media with similar departures from randomness  @xcite .",
    "also , the complementary logarithmic version has been used in the representation of clustering of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the family of gamma distributions has event space @xmath28 parameters @xmath29 and probability density functions given by @xmath30 then @xmath31 and @xmath32 and we see that @xmath33 controls the mean of the distribution while the spread and shape is controlled by , @xmath34 the square of the coefficient of variation .",
    "the special case @xmath35 corresponds to the situation when @xmath5 represents the random or poisson process in  ( [ negexp ] ) with @xmath36 thus , the family of gamma distributions can model a range of stochastic processes corresponding to non - independent ` clumped ' events , for @xmath37 and dispersed events , for @xmath38 as well as the random case ( cf .",
    "thus , if we think of this range of processes as corresponding to the possible distributions of centroids of extended objects such as galaxies that are initially distributed according to a poisson process with @xmath39 then the three possibilities are :    chaotic or random structure : :    with no interactions among constituents , @xmath40 clustered structure : :    arising from mutually attractive type interactions ,    @xmath41 dispersed structure : :    arising from mutually repulsive type interactions ,    @xmath42    for our gamma - based void model we consider the radius @xmath8 of a spherical void with volume @xmath43 having distribution  ( [ feq ] ) .",
    "then the probability density function for @xmath8 is given by @xmath44 the mean @xmath45 variance @xmath46 and coefficient of variation @xmath47 of @xmath8 are given , respectively , by @xmath48    the fact that the coefficient of variation  ( [ cvr ] ) depends only on @xmath49 gives a rapid parameter fitting of data to the probability density function for void radii  ( [ rpdf ] ) .",
    "numerical fitting to  ( [ cvr ] ) gives @xmath50 this substituted in  ( [ meanr ] ) yields an estimate of @xmath33 to fit a given observational mean .",
    "however , there is a complication : necessarily in order to have a physically meaningful definition for voids , observational measurements introduce a minimum threshold size for voids .",
    "for example , hoyle and vogeley  @xcite used algorithms to obtain statistics on 2dfgrs voids with radius @xmath51 for voids above this threshold they found their mean size is about @xmath52 with a variance of about @xmath53 this of course is not directly comparable with the above distribution for @xmath8 in equation ( [ rpdf ] ) since the latter has domain @xmath54 now , from ( [ rpdf ] ) , the probability that a void has radius @xmath55 is @xmath56 and hence the mean , variance and coefficient of variation for the void distribution with @xmath55 become : @xmath57 where @xmath58    summarizing from hoyle and vogeley  @xcite : + @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 so @xmath63    ( 300,260)(0,0 ) ( -50,-10 ) ( 40,30)@xmath33 ( -42,150)@xmath64 ( 250,84)@xmath49",
    "next we follow the methodology introduced in  @xcite to provide a model that links the number counts in cells and the void probability function and which contains perturbations of the random case .",
    "this exploits the central role of the gamma distribution in providing neighbourhoods of randomness  @xcite that contain all maximum likelihood nearby perturbations of the random case and it allows a direct use of the linked information geometries for the coupled stochastic processes of voids and galaxies . clearly , in regions where the local void volume @xmath5 tends to be small the local matter density @xmath7 will tend to be large .",
    "since the matter density must be bounded , then a simple phenomenological model that couples the two random variables in the stochastic process is @xmath65 where the upper bound on @xmath7 has been set to unity .",
    "this model was explored in  @xcite and it is easy to show that the probability density function for @xmath7 is given by the log gamma distribution @xmath66 this distribution for local galactic number density has mean @xmath67 variance @xmath68 and coefficient of variation @xmath69 given by @xmath70 using the reported value @xmath71 from fairall  @xcite ( page 124 ) for cubical volumes with side length @xmath72 the curve so defined in the parameter space for the log gamma distributions ( [ geq ] ) , has maximum clustering for @xmath73    from the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) , croton et al .",
    "@xcite in figure 2 reported the decay of normalised variance , @xmath74 with scale radius @xmath8 and the associated departure from randomness in the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the probability of finding zero galaxies in a spherical region of radius @xmath8 when the mean number is @xmath77 from that figure 2 we see that , for the data of the volume limited catalogue with magnitude range @xmath78 to @xmath79 and @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 also @xmath84 and @xmath85 at @xmath86    croton et al .",
    "@xcite in table 1 reported @xmath0 values for cubical volumes with side length @xmath87 in the range @xmath88 from figure 3 in that paper we see that , at the scale @xmath72 @xmath89 which gives a coefficient of variation @xmath90    the above - mentioned observations @xmath91 are shown in figure  [ cvn1610 ] on a plot of the coefficient of variation for the number counts in cells from the log gamma family of distributions equation  ( [ geq ] ) .",
    "the range @xmath92 corresponds to clustering regimes .",
    "( 300,260)(0,0 ) ( -50,-10 ) ( 40,30)@xmath33 ( -65,140)@xmath93 ( 240,74)@xmath49    theoretical models for the evolution of galactic clustering through an evolving stochastic process subordinate to the log gamma distribution ( [ geq ] ) of densities could be represented as curves on the space of parameters with the metric ( [ gammametric ] ) interpreting the parameter changes with time in the appropriate way .",
    "the coupling with the void probability function controlled by the gamma distribution ( [ rpdf ] ) allows the corresponding void evolution to be represented .",
    "it is of course very unlikely that this simple model is suitable in all respects but given a different family of distributions the necessary information geometry can be computed for the representation of evolutionary processes .",
    "for stochastic processes subordinate to a given family of parametric statistical models , shannon s information theoretic ` entropy ' or ` uncertainty ' ( cf .",
    "jaynes  @xcite ) is given , up to a factor , by the negative of the expectation of the logarithm of the probability density function .",
    "for the family of models we propose for void volumes  ( [ feq ] ) this entropy is , @xmath94 in particular , at unit mean , the maximum entropy ( or maximum uncertainty ) occurs at @xmath39 which is the random case , and then @xmath95    the ` maximum likelihood ' estimates @xmath96 of @xmath97 can be expressed in terms of the mean and mean logarithm of a set of independent observations @xmath98 these estimates are obtained in terms of the properties of @xmath99 by maximizing the ` log - likelihood ' function @xmath100 with the following result @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the digamma function , the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function    the usual riemannian information metric on the 2-dimensional parameter space @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 the important point about this non - euclidean metric on the space of parameters is that it derives from log - likelihood properties and so it is the ` correct ' one for this family of distributions .",
    "given a different family then the information geometry can be computed for that ; the geometries are known also for bivariate gamma distributions , gaussian and multivariate gaussian distributions among others . for more details about the geometry",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the 1-dimensional subspace parametrized by @xmath35 corresponds to the available ` random ' processes .",
