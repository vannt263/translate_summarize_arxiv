    "gamma - ray emission from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) is one of the important properties in terms of activities and energetics of the central engine and emergence of relativistic jets . in the _ egret _ ( energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope ) era ,",
    "nearly a hundred of gamma - ray emitting agns were known @xcite .",
    "those are predominantly radio - loud agns and categorized as blazars , suggesting a close connection between gamma - ray and radio emission . on the other hand , observations with the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( hereafter _ fermi _ ) have resulted in the identification of more than a thousand agns , some of which are categorized as non - blazar active galaxies or radio galaxies @xcite . moreover , _ fermi _ has also revealed the existence of new classes of gamma - ray emitting agns , one of which is narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) .",
    "nls1 is a subclass of agns and identified by their optical properties ; narrow permitted lines , @xmath4  km  s@xmath3 , emitted from the broad line region , [ ] @xmath5 , and a bump due to @xcite .",
    "first detection of gamma - ray emission in a radio - loud nls1 by _ fermi _ was made for pmn j0948 + 0022 @xcite .",
    "intensive observations by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard _ fermi _ have revealed new detections of gamma - rays of other three radio - loud nls1s @xcite .",
    "seven nls1s are listed as gamma - ray sources detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat to date @xcite and the number of gamma - ray nls1s is increasing .",
    "these are surprising discoveries because most of nls1s are hosted in a spiral galaxy , which usually does not have relativistic jets , while blazars are hosted in an elliptical galaxy .",
    "although milliarcsecond ( mas)-scale images have been obtained for several gamma - ray nls1s with very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations @xcite and some of them have revealed presence of a closely aligned relativistic jet , there are still large uncertainties for the derived parameters in gamma - ray nls1s and it is therefore important to investigate the parsec ( pc)-scale properties .",
    "nls1s are also considered to have high - mass accretion rates , close to the eddington limit , and lower black hole masses ( @xmath6 ) compared to other classes of agns @xcite .",
    "considering the relation among radio loudness , the black hole mass , and the accretion rate ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , those properties imply that nls1s are generally radio - quiet objects and have weak or no jet activity @xcite .",
    "in fact , previous studies show that the fraction of radio - loud nls1s is low ( about 7% ) compared to other agn classes @xcite and nls1s have lower jet activities compared to other types of radio - loud agns @xcite .",
    "nls1s are thus considered to be at the high / soft state containing a slim disk while blazars and flat - spectrum radio quasars are at the low / hard state , in the analogy of galactic x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to study relation between the state transition and the jet activity in agns since we can import knowledge of the state transition for galactic x - ray binaries to agns .",
    "again , multiepoch and high - resolution radio observations are essential to investigate them .",
    "in this paper we report the results of simultaneous single - dish and very long baseline interferometer ( vlbi ) observations of 1h  0323 + 342 at 8  ghz , including the archival data obtained by the very long baseline array ( vlba ) .",
    "1h  0323 + 342 is one of seven gamma - ray emitted nls1s detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat @xcite .",
    "an optical observation by the _ hubble space telescope _ shows that the source is hosted in a spiral galaxy containing single spiral arm @xcite , while another results claim that the host galaxy of the source has a ring structure triggered by an interacting / merging process @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is estimated to be a few times @xmath8 with a few different methods using the width and luminosity of the h@xmath9 line and the continuum luminosity at 5100  @xcite .",
    "this is in good agreement with @xmath10 from the parameter used to model the spectral energy distribution @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate the accretion disk luminosity to be @xmath11  erg  s@xmath3 , or @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the eddington luminosity .",
    "although these characteristics are typically seen among nls1s , the source has extremely high radio loudness @xmath14 @xcite , or @xmath15 @xcite , and is listed in one of 29 very radio - loud ( @xmath16 ) nls1s @xcite , implying activities due to relativistic jets in the inner region .",
    "a redshift , @xmath17 , of @xmath18 is measured by @xcite and we adopt this value , although some of previous articles adopt @xmath19 reported by @xcite .",
    "1h  0323 + 342 is the nearest object among gamma - ray nls1s , allowing us to investigate the inner region of the source with higher angular resolution .",

    "we present the results of single - dish and vlbi observations in section  [ sec : section3 ] . in section  [ sec : section4 ] , we describe the results of the archival vlba observations . in section  [ sec : section5 ] , we discuss the observed variability feature , relation to general properties of nls1s , and possible connections between gamma - ray emission and the pc - scale structure . the achievements of our study are summarized in section  [ sec : section6 ] . throughout this paper , we define the spectral index , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the flux density at the frequency @xmath23 , and we adopt a @xmath24cdm cosmology with @xmath25  km  s@xmath3  mpc@xmath3 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 from the results of the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _",

    "observations were made in right - circular polarization at 8.424  ghz with the total bandwidth of 32  mhz .",
    "observed sources were 1h  0323 + 342 as a target , j0310 + 3814 as a gain calibrator ( separation angle of 494 from 1h  0323 + 342 ) , da  193 as a flux calibrator , and 3c  84 as a bandpass calibrator .",
    "the total on - source duration for 1h  0323 + 342 is 443  minutes in all epochs .",

    "we did not employ a standard _ a  priori _ amplitude calibration using the system noise temperature because it was not measured during the observations at several stations .",

    "flux densities were determined comparing cross - correlation amplitudes for each source with those for da  193 . to correct variation of the antenna gain due to change of the antenna elevation , we applied self - calibration to the gain calibrator j0310 + 3814 .",
    "it can be considered as a point source and was observed once an hour with the on - source duration of 5 minutes per scan .",
    "a fitted curve to the solutions for the gain calibrator was applied to other sources .    through the procedure described above",

    "we finally determined a flux density of j0310 + 3814 at epoch 1 to be same as that obtained at epoch 2 for the following reasons . at epochs 2 and 3 , both kashima 34",

    "f - gamma results show that the flux density varies almost simultaneously at observing frequencies from 2.64  ghz to 32.0  ghz @xcite , therefore we believe that the flux variation observed with y32 is intrinsic .",
    "the total flux varies significantly during the period of y32 monitoring compared with the constant flux .",
    "the maximum and minimum flux densities during y32 monitoring can be seen as @xmath33  mjy on 2010 november 13 and @xmath34  mjy on 2011 february 5 , respectively , corresponding to a flux decrease of 38% in 84 days , while the total flux does not decrease monotonically .",

    "jvn images could not resolve the central one , containing a few components in the images obtained by vlba , as shown in section  [ sec : section4 ] . to quantify the relative location and the flux density of each component of the jvn images , we modeled the calibrated images with elliptical gaussian components .",

    "the sum of the flux densities of the components c and d1 is in good agreement with both the total cleaned flux and single - dish measurements by y32 , as shown in tables  [ tbl : table1 ] and [ tbl : table2 ] , while the very large array ( vla ) observations at 1.4  ghz on 2006 february 7 and 2007 january 15 ( vla observation code ; ap501 ) show the source having a large - scale structure with the total size of about a hundred kpc @xcite and with the flux density for the extended component of 198  mjy @xcite .",
    "we consider that the extended structure has an optically thin spectrum and therefore shows very weak emission at around 8  ghz .",
    "it should also be noted that the flux density of the component c gradually decreases similar to the total flux density , while the flux density of the component d1 seems to be stable , as shown in figure  [ fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the results indicate that the short - term radio variability observed with y32 ( and probably the gamma - ray emitting region ) is mainly associated with the central component .",
    "to investigate time variation of the pc - scale structure of the source , we reduced data of the archival vlba observations at 2 , 8 , and 15  ghz .",

    "we could reconstruct vlba images with three elliptical gaussian components c0 , d2 , and d1 at 8  ghz , while the component d1 could be resolved into two components d1b and d1a in the epochs 2005.636 and 2008.303 . in the epochs 1996.374 at 2.3",
    "ghz and 2003.688 the images could be modeled by two components because of lower angular resolution than other epochs .",

    "this @xmath156 is accountable for the observed flux ratio of approaching to receding jet components mentioned above .",

    "4 .   the brightness temperature obtained by the jvn observations is greater than @xmath169  k , and the radio power at 8  ghz is estimated to be @xmath2  w  hz@xmath3 .",
    "these indicate that a nonthermal process in the central region is responsible for the radio emission from the source .",
    "the doppler factor is estimated to be @xmath170 assuming the condition of energy equipartition in the jvn observations , and @xmath79 from the observed radio variability , indicating the existence of relativistic jet(s ) .",
    "this is the third source in which the doppler beaming effect is detected in gamma - ray nls1s by both direct imaging with vlbi and the flux variation .",
    "the jvn observations revealed the existence of doppler - boosted jet components which affect radio loudness of the source .",
    "although the source shows extremely high apparent radio loudness with @xmath171 , the intrinsic @xmath104 is less than 20 applying the doppler factor obtained by the jvn observations .",
    "hence , for 1h  0323 + 342 with a smaller black hole mass ( @xmath172 ) and high accretion rate ( @xmath173 ) , there seems to be no large discrepancy with previous studies suggesting a correlation between @xmath104 and the black hole mass , and anti - correlation between @xmath104 and the accretion rate . 7 .",
    "multiepoch jvn and vlba images detected slowly moving jet components d2 and d1 with apparent velocities of @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively , and the real distance between the components c and d1 was estimated as 0.13  kpc .",
    "the kinematic age of @xmath131 years is derived for both components assuming the linear expansion , which is significantly different with that of kpc - scale components ( @xmath176  @xmath134 years ) . by combining the results of the spectral fitting to the flux measurements and observed properties in terms of the position angle and lack of medium - scale radio emission , we conclude that the pc - scale jet structure represents recurrent jet activity .",
