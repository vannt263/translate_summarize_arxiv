    "we observe that for two interconnected networks of oscillators with time delay , a weak intra - network coupling , and random initial distribution of phases , two frequency communities emerge within the same network , each synchronized with its mirror in a breathing mode , as shown in fig .",

    ", the color describes the frequency and the vertical position the phase .",
    "the frequency synchronization within groups occurs with phase locking .",
    "interestingly , inter - network coupled pairs of nodes oscillate with the same frequency ( same color ) but might be either in phase or anti - phase ( phase shift of @xmath34 ) .",
    "consequently , the presence of these two frequency groups affects the perception of the new global oscillatory state , which we call breathing synchronization .",
    "figure  [ fig::breathing_r](b ) shows the time evolution of the order parameters @xmath19 and @xmath40 for each population , quantifying this breathing behavior . for each curve",
    ", the maximum corresponds to the instant at which both groups of frequencies are in phase , while the minimum to an anti - phase between groups in the same network .",
    "additionally , since for one frequency there is a phase shift of @xmath34 between inter - network pairs of nodes , the minimum in one network corresponds , necessarily , to the maximum in the other .",
    "cohesion within each community affects the amplitude of the breathing , as indicated by the order parameters for different values of @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig::breathing_r](b ) .",
    "the weaker the intra - network coupling , the smaller is this amplitude .",
    "the observed breathing behavior is in deep contrast with what is expected for an isolated network ( @xmath41 ) . for isolated networks ,",
    "the classical kuramoto model is recovered , with frequency and phase synchronization emerging at a critical coupling @xmath42 . above this threshold , a macroscopic fraction of oscillators",
    "is synchronized , all with the same frequency and phase .",
    "the value of @xmath43 increases with the variance of the natural frequency distribution .",
    "since here we consider the same natural frequency for all oscillators ( @xmath5 ) , @xmath44 .",
    "the group of synchronized oscillators has frequency @xmath45 and the order parameter @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) saturates in time at a non - zero steady - state value  @xcite , which is a monotonically increasing function of ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "interestingly , in the case of coupled networks , and for sufficient inter - network couplings , none of the two frequencies is @xmath49 .    to better understand the breathing synchronization , and in particular the emergence of frequency groups ,",
    "let us consider the case of two coupled oscillators with time delay .",
    "the analytic solution obtained by schuster and wagner  @xcite for this problem indicates that , depending on the initial phase difference between oscillators ( see fig .",
    "s1 in the supplemental material ) , the pair can synchronize with different frequencies @xmath50 , which are solutions of , @xmath51 in spite of oscillating with the same frequency in the stationary state , the two oscillators might either be in phase , if @xmath52 , or anti - phase , otherwise . in the case of inter - connected networks , in the limit @xmath53 , the stationary state is expected to include all possible solutions of eq .",
    "[ eq : schuster ] .",
    "surprisingly , our results with a weak coupling reveal instead two frequency groups with phase locking",
    ". nevertheless , the observed frequencies are consistent with the solution of eq .",
    "[ eq : schuster ] and are unique with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath25 .",
    "the final frequency of a pair of oscillators only depends of their relative initial displacement .    as we show next , when the internal coupling ( @xmath29 )",
    "is further increased , breathing synchronization is no longer stable and each network is synchronized , in one of two other synchronization regimes . in simulations with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath30 , when @xmath56 interactions among oscillators in the same network become more relevant than the inter - network delayed coupling , and the larger frequency group , in terms of size , dominates over the smaller one .",
    "this competition results in all oscillators synchronizing at the same frequency and the order parameter of each network saturates in time . to systematically study the dependence on @xmath29",
    ", we analyze the frequency correlation among intra - network neighbors @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig::wi_x_wj ] shows the scatter plots of the pair ( @xmath57 ) for different values of intra - network coupling strengths .",
    "the limit @xmath53 is represented by the blue empty circles in all panels and the radius corresponds to the relative population of pairs when considering several samples . in this limit , the oscillators have all one of two possible frequencies , with four possible combinations of frequency pairs . from the relative size of the circles , we observe that the lowest frequency ( @xmath58 for @xmath55 and @xmath30 ) is the most populated one . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::wi_x_wj](a ) , for @xmath56 most nodes are synchronized with the lowest frequency and therefore a large percentage of the pairs are in the left - bottom corner .",
    "similarly to the kuramoto model , in this _ competing _ state , oscillators synchronize at a unique stable frequency ( @xmath58 ) , which is a solution of eq .  [ eq : schuster ] .",
    "as @xmath29 is further increased ( fig .",
    "[ fig::wi_x_wj](b)-(d ) ) , due to the strength of the intra - network coupling , each network tends to behave like a _ supernode _ and , depending on the initial conditions , one of two frequencies is obtained , which is again a solution of eq .  [ eq : schuster ] .",
    "further analysis across samples ( see fig .",
    "s2 in supplemental material ) also shows that the average phase displacement between pairs of oscillators in different networks reaches @xmath59 for intermediary values of @xmath29 , and decreases again once the supernodes are formed ( see fig .",
    "s2(a ) in supplemental material ) . for large @xmath29",
    ", the supernodes can be either in phase or anti - phase and , therefore , the average variance within a network has a value between zero and @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "s2(b ) in supplemental material ) .",
    "results are qualitatively similar for networks with fixed node degree ( see fig .",
    "s2(c - d ) in supplemental material ) or with different average degree ( see fig .",
    "s2(e - f ) in supplemental material ) .    to summarize the effect of several combinations of parameters , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig::colormap ] the phase diagram in the space of the two coupling strengths ( @xmath29 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "to identify each regime , we compute the amount of oscillators with steady frequency below and above the mean value of possible frequencies ( see section methods ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , over different samples ( see top inset of fig .  [ fig::colormap ] ) . the color map of the main plot of fig .",
    "[ fig::colormap ] shows the ratio of these quantities .",
    "while the blue area represents the domain of @xmath29 and @xmath28 combinations that leads to the smaller frequency , the shades in red represent the two regions where two frequencies can be achieved . note that , the nature of the two synchronization regimes in red is different .",
    "the one in the left ( lower @xmath29 ) is characterized by the breathing behavior due to the presence of two frequency groups within each network .",
    "by contrast , in the supernode regime all nodes within a network are in phase locking , with the same frequency and , therefore , the order parameter is constant in time in the steady state . in the bottom inset , we show the phase boundaries for different time delays . from this , one can also see that the transition between regimes changes substantially for different time delays .",
    "since delay and natural frequency are not multiples , harmonic interactions are considered negligible .",

    "[ fig::colormap ] . in fig .",
    "s3 of the supplemental material we show that the transitions between regimes with one and two stable frequencies are abrupt .     and @xmath29 showing that the prevalence of one frequency over the other changes according to the coupling strengths .",
    "the color of each region represents the occurrence of the two theoretical frequencies : red if two frequencies ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and blue if only one ( @xmath62 ) is observed .",

    "the presence of a time delay between two coupled networks of oscillators poses a new challenge to the global control of the system .",
    "we have shown that the interplay between coupling and delay leads to states of either a unique or two possible synchronized frequencies .",
    "we have found that , even with a weak intra - network coupling , oscillators within the same network split into two frequency groups .",
    "each group has a mirror one in the other network oscillating at the same frequency .",
    "however , depending on their frequency , a group can be either in phase or anti - phase with its mirror in the other network , resulting in breathing synchronization . also , we show that an arbitrary increase of the intra - network coupling is not an option to achieve phase and frequency synchronization regardless of its initial conditions . in a certain region of the parameter space ,",
    "the intra - network coupling promotes the formation of two supernodes ( one per network ) , and two frequencies become stable .",
    "we have numerically identified the transition regions between regimes .",
    "future works should consider recent advances on group synchronization to analytically study these transitions through linear stability analysis using the master stability function  @xcite .",

    "@xcite have shown that the distance and interaction strength between regions of a plasmodial slime mold can be fine tuned .",
    "this organism is a network of tubular structures with periodic variations in the thickness . in the experimental study ,",
    "the focus was only on the regime where the intra - region interaction is much stronger than the inter - region one . using the same methodology , it is possible to control the intra - region interaction and study the different regimes described here . in particular",
    ", it would be of interest to observe oscillations with two different frequencies within the same region due to the communication lag with the other region , resulting in breathing synchronization .",
    "another example where synchronization in interdependent networks certainly plays a relevant role is the human brain .",
    "being a highly modular structure , its coherent operation must rely on the independence of different brain modules , which are functionally specialized , as well as on their efficient connection to ensure proper information transmission and processing . in a recent study  @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the optimal integration of these modules , which can be interpreted as complex networks made of intra - network couplings , is achieved through the addition of long - range inter - network ties , therefore behaving globally as a small - world system .",
    "moreover , their experimental observations are also consistent with the fact that these inter - network couplings should be spatially organized in such a way as to maximize information transfer under wiring cost constraints  @xcite .",
    "to accomplish multisensory integration in this intricate architecture of neuronal firing - oscillators  @xcite , however , information originating from distinct sensory modalities ( vision , audition , taction , etc . )",
