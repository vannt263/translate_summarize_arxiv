    "since recent years there is an increasing interest in studying curvature notions on discrete spaces .",
    "first of all there are various approaches to ricci curvature based on @xmath1-optimal transport on metric measure spaces starting with the work of ollivier , @xcite .",
    "these ideas were employed for graphs by various authors @xcite to study geometric and spectral questions .",
    "a related and very effective definition using @xmath2-optimal transport was introduced in @xcite .",
    "secondly , in @xcite there is the approach of defining curvature bounds via curvature - dimension - inequalities using a calculus of bakry - emery based on bochner s formula for riemannian manifolds .",
    "similar ideas were used @xcite to prove a li - yau inequality for graphs .",
    "finally let us mention the work on so called ricci - flat graphs @xcite and @xcite for another approach .",
    "all these approaches have in common that they model some kind of ricci curvature and that they are very useful to study lower curvature bounds .",
    "classically there is a curvature notion for planar polygonal complexes , called tessellating graphs , defined by an angular defect .",
    "these ideas go back as far as to works of descartes @xcite and became mathematical folklore since then .",
    "often there is no obvious relation of this curvature to the recent notions of ricci curvature above . despite the rather restrictive setting of planar graphs",
    "this curvature notion has proven to very effective to derive very strong spectral and geometric consequences of upper curvature bounds @xcite which often relate to results to upper bounds on sectional curvature of riemannian manifolds .",
    "( for consequences on lower bounds see , e.g. , @xcite as well . )",
    "thus , it seems desirable to identify a class of more general complexes where on can define and introduce sectional curvature .",
    "this is the aim of this work .",
    "the objects under investigation in this article are _ polygonal complexes with planar substructures_. they are @xmath0-dimensional cw - complexes equipped with a family of subcomplexes homeomorphic to the euclidean plane , which we call _ apartments _ , since they have certain properties similar to the ones required for apartments in euclidean and hyperbolic buildings .",
    "the @xmath0-cells of a polygonal complex with planar substructures can be viewed as polygons and they are called faces and their closures are called chambers . the geometry is based on this set of faces and their neighboring structures . in particular , there is a combinatorial distance function on the set of faces .",
    "let us discuss the properties of apartments in more detail .",
    "first of all , we require that there are enough apartments , that is any two faces have to lie in at least one apartment ( condition ( pcps1 ) in definition  [ dfn : pcps ] below ) .",
    "sometimes , we require the stronger condition ( @xmath3 that every infinite geodesic ray of faces is included in an apartment .",
    "the second crucial property is that all apartments are _ convex _ ( see condition ( pcps2 ) ) .",
    "these properties are also similar to the ones satisfied by flats in symmetric spaces .",
    "the definition of polygonal complexes with planar substructures comprises both planar tessellations and all @xmath0-dimensional euclidean and hyperbolic buildings .",
    "we use the apartments of a polygonal complex with planar substructures to define combinatorial curvatures on them .",
    "since these apartments could be seen in a vague sense as tangent planes of the polygonal complex with planar substructures , we call these curvatures _ sectional curvatures_. we introduce sectional curvatures on the faces and on the corners of an apartment ( see definition [ dfn : curv ] ) , and they are invariants measuring the _ local geometry _ of the polygonal complex with planar substructures .    the definition of polygonal complexes with planar substructures and basic notions are introduced in section  [ s : basics ] . the results in this article are then given in sections  [ s : geometry ] and [ s : spectrum ] .",
    "while most of these results are known for planar tessellations , it seems to us that several of these results were not known for euclidean and hyperbolic buildings .",
    "next , we explain our results in more detail .    in section  [ s : geometry ]",
    "we discuss implications of negative and non - positive curvature to the _ global and asymptotic geometry _ of a polygonal complex with planar substructures .",
    "many of the presented results have well - known counterparts in the smooth setting of riemannian manifolds . amongst our results ,",
    "we present a combinatorial cartan - hadamard theorem for non - positively curved polygonal complexes with planar substructures ( see theorem  [ t : cut_locus ] ) and we conclude gromov hyperbolicity and positivity of the cheeger isoperimetric constant for negatively curved polygonal complexes with planar substructures with certain bounds on the vertex and face degree ( see theorems  [ t : gromov ] and [ t : cheeger1 ] ) .",
    "these results are based on negativity or non - positivity of the sectional corner curvature .",
    "we also state an analogue of myers theorem in the case of strictly positive sectional face curvature ( see theorem [ t : myers ] ) .",
    "section [ s : spectrum ] is devoted to spectral considerations of the laplacian .",
    "we discuss combinatorial / geometric criteria to guarantee emptiness of the essential spectrum and to derive certain eigenvalue asymptotics on polygonal complexes with planar substructures ( see theorem [ t : discretespectrum ] ) .",
    "we also show that non - positive sectional corner curvature on polygonal complexes with planar substructures implies absence of finitely supported eigenfunctions ( see theorem [ t : uniquecontinuation ] ) . finally ,",
    "we derive solvability of the dirichlet problem at infinity for polygonal complexes with planar substructures in the case of negative sectional corner curvature ( see theorem [ thm : dirichlet ] ) .    as mentioned before",
    ", @xmath0-dimensional euclidean and hyperbolic buildings provide large classes of examples of polygonal complexes with planar substructures . while all these spaces have non - positive sectional face curvature , their corner curvature is not always necessarily non - positively curved .",
    "the main purpose of the final section [ s : examples ] is to provide a self - contained short survey over these important classes .",

    "this work would not be the same without the cheerful atmosphere created by lumen keller during the initial stage of this collaboration .",
    "in this section we introduce _ polygonal complexes with planar substructures _ and define a notion of sectional curvature on theses spaces . in order to do",
    "so we introduce polygonal complexes and planar tessellations first . in the second subsection",
    "we explore some basic consequences of the convexity assumption we impose . in the third subsection",
    "we introduce a combinatorial sectional curvature notions for these spaces .",
    "the following definition of polygonal complexes is found in @xcite .",

    "we denote the set of @xmath5-cells by @xmath6 and call them _ vertices _ , we denote the set of @xmath7-cells by @xmath8 and call them the _ edges _ and we denote the set of @xmath0-cells by @xmath9 and call them the _ faces_. we write @xmath10 .",
    "note that the closures of all edges and faces in @xmath4 are necessarily compact ( since they are images of compact sets under the continuous characteristic maps , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ) .",
    "we call two vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 _ adjacent _ or _ neighbors _ if they are connected by an edge in which case we write @xmath13 .",
    "we call two different faces @xmath14 and @xmath15 _ adjacent _ or _ neighbors _ if their closures intersect in an edge and we write @xmath16 .",
    "it is convenient to call the closure of a face a _",

    "the _ degree _ @xmath19 of an edge @xmath20 is the number of chambers containing @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary @xmath22 of a face @xmath23 is the set of all @xmath7-cells @xmath24 being contained in the closure @xmath25 . since in cw - complexes",
    "every compact set can meet only finitely many cells ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "a.1 ) ) , we have @xmath26 . the _ degree _ @xmath27 of a face @xmath28 is the number of faces that are adjacent to @xmath14 and , in contrast to @xmath29 , the face degree @xmath27 can be infinite .",
    "we call a ( finite , infinite or bi - infinite ) sequence @xmath30 of pairwise distinct faces a _ path _ if successive faces are adjacent .",
    "the _ length _ of the path is one less than the number of components of the sequence .",
    "the _ ( combinatorial ) distance _ between two faces @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the length of the shortest path connecting @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the distance is denoted by @xmath31 . we call a ( finite , infinite or bi - infinite ) path @xmath32 of faces a _ geodesic _ or a _ gallery _ , if we have for any two faces @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the path @xmath35 , i.e. , the distance between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is realized by the path .    we say a polygonal complex @xmath4 is _ planar _ if @xmath4 is homeomorphic to @xmath36 .",
    "we also say that a polygonal complex @xmath4 is _ spherical _ if @xmath4 is homeomorphic to the two - sphere @xmath37 .",
    "next we introduce the notion of a planar tessellation following @xcite .",
    "[ dfn : plantess ] a polygonal complex @xmath38 is called a _ ( planar / spherical ) tessellation _ if @xmath39 is planar / spherical and satisfies the following properties :    * any edge is contained in precisely two different chambers .",

    "every vertex has finitely many neighbors .",
    "note that property ( t3 ) is already implied by ( pc1 ) and ( pc2 ) .",

    ", we like to introduce the following example of a euclidean building .    [ ex : vdov ] let @xmath45 be the finite simplicial complex constructed from the seven equilateral euclidean triangles illustrated in figure  [ f : triangle ] by identifying sides with the same labels @xmath46 .    ]",

    "the group of covering transformations is isomorphic to @xmath55 and acts transitively on the vertices of this building ( see @xcite ) .    for some of our results",
