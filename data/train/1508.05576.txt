    "the self - assembling mechanism of block copolymers sensitively depends on block types , the number of blocks , block - block interactions , architecture , and topology of the block polymers .",
    "the equilibrium ordered patterns can be formed due to the delicate balance between these competing factors . in abc triblock copolymers ,",

    "if the chain lengths of three blocks are comparable , junction points are aligned on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) straight line , then cylindrical morphologies can be formed naturally .",
    "their cross sections tend to show two - dimensional ( 2d ) patterns since polymer / polymer interfaces can be flat surfaces due to the repulsion forces between `` unconnected '' branches .",
    "these factors lead to the formation of 2d polygonal tiling patterns , or archimedean tiling .",

    ", we will explore the phase behavior of abc star triblock copolymers , including 2d and 3d structures , with asymmetric interaction parameters between chemically different blocks .",
    "theoretical approaches to investigating the phase behavior of block copolymers , often involve minimizing an appropriate free energy functional of the system , and comparing the free energies of different candidate structures .",
    "therefore a systematic examination of the emergence and stability of ordered phases requires the availability of suitable free energy functionals and accurate methods to compute the free energy of ordered phases .",
    "owing to a large number of studies , it has been well proven that the scft provides a powerful theoretical framework for the study of the phase behavior of block copolymers@xcite .",
    "in particular , the scft can be used to determine the relative stability of different phases because it provides an accurate estimate of the free energy .",
    "the essence of the scft is that the free energy of the system can be written as a functional of the spatially varying polymer densities and a set of conjugate fields . minimizing the free energy functional with respect to the densities and conjugate fields leads to a set of equations , encoded as scft equations .",
    "the scft equations are a set of highly nonlinear equations with multi - solutions which correspond to the different ordered phases of block copolymers .",
    "the equations also have a strong nonlocality that emerges from the connection of propagators and densities , conjugate fields .",

    "ceniceros and fredrickson@xcite devised a class of efficient semi - implicit schemes for solving the scft equations using the asymptotic expansion technology .",

    "a generic strategy of theoretical studying phase behavior of complex block copolymer systems includes two steps@xcite .",
    "the first step involves an efficient strategy to produce a library of possible candidate structures . in the second step ,",
    "the candidate structures are used as initial conditions in the more accurate methods to compute free energies , which are used to construct phase diagrams of the systems . in this work",
    ", we apply this strategy to examine the phase behavior of abc star triblock copolymers using the scft .",
    "specifically , the strategies developed in our previous work@xcite are used as a screening technique to obtain candidate structures as many as possible .",
    "these strategies include ( 1 ) knowledge from previous experiments and theories ; ( 2 ) knowledge from related systems , for example , diblock copolymers ; ( 3 ) combination and interpolation of known structures ; and ( 4 ) random initial configurations .",
    "using these candidate structures as initial conditions , a fourth - order pseudospectral method combined with anderson mixing method is employed to study the stability of ordered phases .",
    "to model the asymmetric interacting experimental systems of isp and isf , the interaction parameters of @xmath27 are used in our study .",
    "it should be emphasized that , to broaden the scope of the research , the 2d and 3d ordered phases are included in our calculations .",
    "the resulting free energies of the different ordered phases are used to construct phase diagrams .",
    "there are two main steps in studying the phase behavior of block copolymers .",
    "the first step is to obtain possible candidate structures as many as possible .",
    "several strategies of exploring ordered phases have been proposed in our previous works@xcite . beyond the random initial values ,",
    "these approaches include ( 1 ) knowledge from experiments and theories , such as small - angle x - ray scattering images , space group theory for periodic structures ; ( 2 ) knowledge from related systems ; ( 3 ) combination and interpolation of known structures . using these diverse strategies of initialization ,",
    "a large number of ordered phases can be generated as the solutions of the scft equations .",
    "in addition , the possible candidate structures from previous theoretical and experimental studies are considered in our calculations .",
    "the second step is to identify the stability of these phases by comparing their free energies using efficient numerical methods . in this work ,",
    "we combine an improved pseudosepectral method with anderson mixing algorithm to solve the scft equations for periodic block - copolymer morphologies .",
    "a fourth - order accurate adams - bashford scheme@xcite is used to discretize the mdes .",
    "the initial values required to apply this formula are obtained using a special extrapolation method@xcite , based on the second - order operator - splitting scheme@xcite .",
    "a modified integral formula for closed interval is chosen to solve the integrated equations - that can guarantee fourth - order precision in @xmath46-direction whether the number of discretization points is even or odd@xcite . to ensure the accuracy , we require that these substeps of contour length @xmath46 are smaller than @xmath53 in the fourth - order accurate scheme",
    ". the fft is used to translate the data between real- and fourier - space in the pseudospectral method .    to obtain the equilibrium morphologies of scft equations",
    ", iterative methods shall be required to update the conjugate fields .",
    "for this step we choose the anderson mixing algorithm , firstly proposed by anderson@xcite , then introduced into polymer theoretical calculations by schmid and mller@xcite , thompson et al.@xcite owing to the local convergence of this method , we use the simple mixing method alone at the start of the algorithm to obtain better initial values for the fields , followed by anderson mixing approach alone to accelerate the convergent procedure to the prescribed accuracy in the fields .",
    "the anderson mixing method requires the fields of previous @xmath28 steps when update new fields . using the previous @xmath28 step fields",
    ", the anderson mixing method produces an @xmath28-order linear equations system from a least square problem",
    ". then the new fields will be obtained by a combination of the fields of previous @xmath28 steps , with the solution of linear system being the weight factors .",
    "for relatively simpler systems , such as diblock copolymers , the anderson mixing algorithm can significantly reduce the required number of iterations with few histories@xcite . for more complex situation , a larger @xmath28",
    "shall be taken to update fields to accelerate the convergent procedure .",
    "we find that assembling the @xmath28-order linear system spends more computation time than solving this linear system .",
    "when @xmath28 becomes too large , it will slow the iteration . here",
    "we overcome this problem by rearranging the elements of the @xmath54 matrix .",
    "the technical details can be found in the appendix section . by using our approach ,",
    "the anderson mixing method can robustly converge without slowing the scft iterations . in practice , we use the available histories of @xmath55 steps .    here",
    "we only consider the periodic structures , therefore , periodic boundary conditions are imposed on each direction . in our calculations ,",
    "all spatial functions are all expanded in terms of plane waves . for 2d morphologies ,",
    "a square box is simulated .",
    "@xmath56 plane - wave basis functions are used to discretize the 2d box . for 3d structures",
    ", we use a cubic unit cell in most of our calculations .",
    "the number of plane - wave basis functions is @xmath57 .",
    "the size of computation box plays an important role in determining the stability of ordered phases . for a given phase ,",
    "its free energy is minimized with respect to the box sizes by the steepest descent approach coupled with solving the scft equations@xcite .    based on the discussion above",
    ", we summarize the iteration procedure by sketching the numerical recipes :    step 1 : :    starting from the given initial conditions and computational box , the    fourth - order pseudosepectral method combined with anderson mixing    method is applied to obtain the ordered phases when the field s change    is smaller than the prescribed error @xmath58 .",
    "step 2 : :    optimizing the size of unit cell by minimizing the free energy with    the steepest descent method .",
    "step 3 : :    goto * step 1 * until the free energy change is smaller than a given    error @xmath59 .    to ensure enough accuracy , in our implementation , each calculation",
    "is terminated until the field s change ( defined in appendix ) at each iteration is reduced to @xmath60 ( corresponding to a free energy change of about @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62 . for the cases of @xmath63 , @xmath64 in the current work , the relative values of free energy among different phases in determining the phase boundary are from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "therefore our numerical resolution is adequately accurate for constructing phase diagrams .",
    "the previously theoretical studies mainly focus on the equally interacting abc star triblock copolymer systems , i.e. , @xmath67@xcite .",
    "however , under experimental circumstances as mentioned above , many abc star triblock copolymers with asymmetric interactions have been synthesized to observe their phase behaviors , such as isp@xcite and isf@xcite star triblock copolymers . in particular",
    ", the interaction parameters of the above systems satisfy the relationship @xmath68 . in order to make a meaningful comparison of the theoretical study and experimental investigation , the interaction parameters are chosen in the calculations so that they are appropriate for these experimental systems .",
    "although accurate values of the flory - huggins parameters are not available in the literatures , qualitative interaction strengths are known to follow the order @xmath69@xcite , @xmath70@xcite . in what follows",
    "we choose asymmetric interaction parameters , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and equal statistical segment lengths .",
    "this is a rough approximation to isp and isf copolymers , with the important difference that , in the idealized system , we neglect the small differences between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .    as mentioned above , there are two main steps in studying the phase behavior of block copolymers .",
    "the first step is to obtain as many possible candidate structures as possible .",
    "the second step is to identify the stability of these patterns by comparing their free energies and construct the phase diagrams . in order to further analyse the stability of candidate patterns , it is helpful to split the free energy into two parts : internal ( @xmath71 ) and entropic ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the internal and entropic contributions to the free energy can be expressed as@xcite @xmath73 where @xmath37 are the block labels .          using different initialization procedures , a large number of candidate structures have been obtained in our previous work@xcite . here",

    "similarly the second and third patterns are named [ 8.8.4 ] and [ 12.6.4 ] , respectively .",
    "the fourth pattern looks more complex .",
    "there are two types of vertices : one is surrounded by 10-gon , 8-gon and 4-gon , whereas the other is formed by a decagon , a hexagon and a tetragon . from our naming convention ,",
    "it should be named [ 10.8.4;10.6.4 ] . however , with the help of triangles and squares of hypothetical tiling , as fig.[fig : phases ] shows the superimposed tiling on a schematic drawing , it is noted all the meeting vertices are surrounded by three regular triangles and two squares , which is one of the archimedean tilings . in order to compare with experimental results ,",
    "we encode it as [ 3.3.4.3.4]@xcite .",
    "the fifth pattern also possesses two kinds of vertices : one is surrounded by 8-gon , 6-gon , and 4-gon , whereas the other is formed by an 8-gon and two 6-gons .",
    "consequently , this pattern is designated as [ 8.6.4;8.6.6 ] .",
    "similarly , the fifth pattern has four kinds of vertices , therefore , it is named [ 10.6.6;10.6.4;8.6.6;8.6.4 ] . besides these polygonal phases , additional three 2d structures , i.e. , three color lamellae ( lam ) , the core - shell cylinders ( hc ) , and",

    "( see fig.[fig : energysplit1x1 ] ) , the stability of 3d hierarchical structures hhc and hdg along the phase path can be understood more readily .",
    "when the ratio of @xmath135 ( @xmath75 ) is large enough , the asymmetric abc star triblock copolymers will exhibit similar phase behavior of asymmetric diblock copolymer .",
    "the longest b arm plays an equal role as the long block in an asymmetric diblock copolymer , whereas the short a arm , together with c arm , are just like the short block in the diblock copolymer . in asymmetric diblock copolymers ,",
    "the systems tend to curve the interface towards the minority domain .",
    "it requires the minority block to stretch , and the cost is more than compensated for by relaxation of the longer blocks , which increases the internal energies@xcite . besides the asymmetry of blocks ,",
    "the segregation power between arms a and c , @xmath3 , is sufficiently large to separate the a- , and c - domains , leading to the formation of hierarchical structures . in particular , for the asymmetric abc star copolymers , the blocks a and c have shorter chains than the short block in ab diblock when the curve interface can be formed .",
    "the a and c arms can freely relax in their packing frustration domains which greatly reduces the entropic energy of the system .",
    "although the internal energies of 3d hierarchical structures are higher than that of l+c structure , their entropic energies are much lower than that of the 2d cylinders - in - lamella phase . as a consequence ,",
    "the combination of the two competing energies makes 3d hierarchical structures stable rather than l+c when @xmath147 . at higher asymmetries ,",
    "block copolymers prefer to form structures with a higher interfacial curvature@xcite .",
    "therefore hhc phase with larger spontaneous curvature than that of hdg phase , has lower free energy when @xmath148 .",
    "the phase transition sequence for systematically varying volume fractions can be obtained by repeating the free energy comparison among the candidate structures .",

    ", l+c , tpl , hhc , hdg and lam phases discussed above , four more ordered structures , hpl , core - shell structures of hc , dg , and bcc , and disordered phase are included in the triangular phase diagram .",
    "the regions of stability of the different phases are obtained by comparing the free energy of these candidate structures .",
    "the phase boundaries are determined by calculating the cross over point of the free energies of the two neighbouring phases .",
    "the most significant feature of the triangular phase diagram is the rich phase behavior with a large number of stable ordered phases .",
    "it should be noted that the ordered structures emerging in diblock copolymers , i.e. , no core - shell cylinders , spheres , gyroid , two - color lamella , are not included in our calculations .",

    "when the chain lengths of three arms are close to each other , junction points are aligned on a straight line , and hence the system tends to form polygonal tilings to get smaller internal energy . as a consequence , the central region of the phase map is dominated by the 2d tiling patterns .",
    "the coordination number of each domain is proportional to the composition of corresponding block .",
    "for example , as discussed above , along the phase path of @xmath150 = @xmath81 , the coordination number of c - domains changes from @xmath98 , to @xmath99 , to @xmath100 , then to @xmath101 , and finally to @xmath102 with increasing of @xmath22 from @xmath151 to @xmath152 . besides the cylindrical structures observed by experiments , two tilings of [ 8.6.6 ; 8.6.4 ] and [ 10.6.6;10.6.4;8.6.6;8.6.4 ] are predicted as the stable phases in our theoretical calculations .",
    "the stability has been analyzed in the above context .",
    "it is very different from the phase behavior of abc linear triblock copolymer melt in which the lamellar phase occupies the large central region@xcite . the reason is attributed to the topology of the star copolymer chain for which the junction points tend to be aligned on a straight line when the chain lengths of three arms are comparable . as the compositions of star copolymer become asymmetric , more 2d and 3d phases , including lam , hc , dg , bcc , hpl , tpl and cylinders - in - lamella of l+c , appear and surround these 2d tilings in the triangular phase diagram . among these phases , lam phase has the following phase transitions .",
    "near the ab edge , cacb layers can be formed whereas abac layers formed near the bc edge , and babc layers formed near the ac edge .",
    "consider the structural evolution that starts from the central 2d tilings region , toward the a- and c - rich corners of the triangular phase diagram .",
    "the phase transition sequence is the cylinders - in - lamella structures ( including hpl and tpl ) , l+c , lam , dg , hc , bcc and disordered phase .",
    "near the a - rich corner , in the cylinders - in - lamellar structure , the c arms form internal cylinders in the b perforated lamellar , then blocks b and c form lamellar together with a - layers .",
    "the packed manners of the cylinders determine the morphologies of hpl and tpl , as shown in fig.[fig : phases ] .",
    "the 2d hierarchical pattern , l+c , where arms b and c form alternating cylinders in the lamellar - based phase , has a stable region between cylinders - in - lamellar structures and lam phase .",
    "the prediction of stability region of l+c phase is generally consistent with the recent experiment in which nunns et al .",
    "observed the phase in @xmath153 star copolymer system@xcite . because of the smallness of @xmath154 , a further segregation between the minority components b and c (",
    "a and b ) will not occur , which implies that the 3d hierarchical structures will not be global stable in this region . instead , the lam phase dominates this area . owing to @xmath155 ,",
    "there is similar phase behavior near the c - rich corner when exchanging the position of arms a and c.    the bcc , hc , and dg phases form continuous areas across the a- and c - rich corners of the triangular phase diagram , where a or c block is the largest arm .",
    "the continuous areas formed by these phases in the triangular phase diagram reflect a continuous evolution in the compositions of the core and shell blocks . for example , consider the evolution of structure along a path within the bcc phase in the a - rich corner , starting from the ab edge , where the structure contains b spheres in an a matrix , to the ac edge .",
    "as the c arm increases its length , a spherical `` shell '' of c grows in the middle of each b - sphere , while the composition of the surrounding shell of b shrinks , until a structure of c spheres in an a matrix is obtained at the ac edge .",
    "an analogous change in the volume fractions of the `` shell '' and `` core '' components occurs in the hc and dg phases in both the a- and c - rich corners .",
    "the phase behavior in the b - rich corner is more complicated .",
    "owing to the largest value of @xmath156 , the minority components a and c tend to a further segregation near the b - rich corner , which leads to the formation of the hierarchical structures . from the cylindrical regions to b - rich corner , the phase sequence of hierarchical morphologies is l+c @xmath85 hdg @xmath85 hhc . near the @xmath75 line ,",
    "the stable regions of hc and dg are separated by hierarchical structures of hhc , hdg , l+c and three archimedean tilings of [ 12.6.4 ] , [ 3.3.4.3.4 ] , [ 8.8.4 ] .",
    "the stable region of bcc phase in the b - rich corner is continuous above that of hhc structure .",
    "consider the structural evolution along a path that starts from the ab edge , where the length of arms satisfies the relationship @xmath157 , toward the @xmath158 isopleth . along this path , for example , in the bcc phase , a arms segregate into spherical domains , surrounded by c - rich pockets shell within the b matrix .",
    "the core - shell hc and dg phases have similar phase behavior with a - core , c - shell and b - matrix .",
    "similarly , structures , such as dg , hc , and bcc , evaluating along a path that starts from bc edge toward the @xmath75 isopleth , are of the c - core , a - shell and b - matrix patterns . in addition",
    ", the disordered phase emerges in the b - rich corner of the triangular phase diagram .    in general ,",
    "the theoretical phase behavior is in agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "however , there are some discrepancies between our theoretical computationus and experimental observations .",
    "some structures observed by experiments in isp star triblock copolymers , such as l+s phase@xcite , zinc - blende type structure@xcite are not obtained in our simulations .",
    "the stable regions of some structures obtained by experiments are not exactly located in the predicted phase regions of our phase diagram .",
    "our theoretical phase diagram predicted [ 8.6.6 ; 8.6.4 ] and [ 10.6.6;10.6.4;8.6.6;8.6.4 ] as stable phases which have been not observed in the experiments .",
    "there are three main possible reasons for these discrepancies .",
    "the first one is that in the experiments many star triblock copolymers are obtained by blending two kinds of copolymers , or adding additional homopolymers .",
    "for example , the zinc - blende type structure was observed in the @xmath159 system which was realized by blending the s homopolymer to @xmath160 .",
    "the homopolymer s can definitely affect the phase stabilities .",
    "the second one is that the predicted phases in the theoretical calculation , such as the [ 8.6.6;8.6.4 ] and [ 10.6.6;10.6.4;8.6.6;8.6.4 ] , may be metastable in the recent experimental systems .",
    "the third one is that there are many differences between theoretical systems and experimental conditions , such as the different interactions , different monomer sizes . in our calculations",
    ", we neglect the differences between @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the difference is small , however , it might influence the self - assembling behavior . at the same time",
    ", the values of interaction may be different from the experimental systems .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the phase behavior of abc star triblock copolymers with asymmetric interaction parameters using the scft .",
    "based on the previous work of screening initialization strategies@xcite , we can obtain a large number of ordered phases in studying the complex polymer systems .",
    "then we used a fourth - order pseudospectral method , combined with the anderson mixing algorithm to calculate the free energy of the observed phases .",
    "motivated by previously experimental studies , the flory - huggins interaction parameters of @xmath161 , @xmath63 are used to model the experimental systems of isp and isf star copolymers in bulk . to extend the scope of theoretical study , a large number of 2d and 3d ordered structures have been involved in our calculations . in order to shed light on the phase behavior of the abc star triblock copolymers , we first determined the phase stability along the phase path @xmath162 .",
    "our results agree with those of isp star triblock copolymers for cylindrical phases well .",
    "then we calculated the phase regions along the phase path @xmath163 . on this phase path , besides the cylindrical structures , we emphatically analyzed the stability of hierarchical structures of l+c , hdg , hhc .",
    "the phase stability has been analyzed by splitting the scft energy functional into internal and entropic parts in detail .",
    "finally we constructed a very complicated triangular phase diagram with these candidate structures .",
    "owing to the case of interactions @xmath164 , the phase diagram has only one mirror symmetric axis @xmath75 .",
    "fifteen ordered structures and the inhomogeneous phase constitute the triangular phase diagram . in general , the phase regions predicted by our scft calculations are consistent with previous theoretical studies of either scft calculations or mc , dpd simulations which mainly focus on the equal interaction systems .",
    "however , in our calculations , the interaction parameters are more closely related to experimental systems , such as isp and isf star triblock copolymers , i.e. , the asymmetric interaction parameters @xmath27 .",
    "it has been found that the asymmetry of the interaction parameters plays a profound role in the complex phase formation .",
    "furthermore , our predicted phase diagram involves more phases , especially 3d structures , and presents more comprehensive phase behavior .",
    "our calculations and analysis can be helpful to understand the self - assembling mechanism of complex structures .",
    "the resulting phase behavior extends the theoretical study to the asymmetrically interacting abc star triblock copolymers . and",
    "the presented phase diagram will be a useful guide for further study of abc star triblock copolymers .",
