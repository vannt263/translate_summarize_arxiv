    "the investigation of the transport properties of highly correlated fermionic systems has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "a thorough understanding of the conductivity in particular is essential for the technical application of materials such as metallic oxides in electronic devices .",
    "the development of a new analytic approach , the limit of infinite dimension for fermionic systems @xcite , allowed the numerical description of the metal - insulator occuring in the half - filled hubbard model in @xmath4 for higher values of the interaction @xmath5 assuming a homogeneous phase @xcite .",
    "the latter assumption means that one deliberately ignores the possible occurence of symmetry breaking for the sake of simplicity .",
    "it is argued that on frustrated lattices symmetry breaking is suppressed so that the metal - insulator transition occurs at higher temperatures than those at which symmetry breaking sets in .    with this background in mind ,",
    "it is the aim of this work to extend and to complement the results known so far into two directions .",
    "first , the finite dimensionality of realistic systems , i.e.mostly @xmath6 , shall be included at least to lowest non - trivial order in an expansion in @xmath2 .",
    "much care is used in including these correction without physical and/or analytic inconsistencies .",
    "it is shown that it is _ not _ sufficient to use a conserving , @xmath7-derivable approximation in the sense of baym / kadanoff .",
    "furthermore , the true three - dimensional dos will be used .",
    "second , the influence of symmetry breaking on the conductivity , especially the question of possible metal - insulator transitions induced by symmetry breaking shall be investigated .    to this end , the model of spinless fermions with repulsive interaction for particles on adjacent sites",
    "is considered on a generic bipartite lattice , namely the simple cubic lattice .",
    "its hamiltonian at half - filling @xmath8 reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 creates ( annihilates ) a fermion at site @xmath11 .",
    "the sum @xmath12 runs over all sites @xmath11 and @xmath13 which are nearest neighbors .",
    "the coordination number @xmath14 appears for the proper scaling of the kinetic energy @xcite and for the proper scaling of the potential energy @xcite .",
    "the interaction constant is @xmath5 .    in this model",
    "the symmetry is broken yielding an ab - cdw at half - filling @xcite for infinitesimal values of the interaction at @xmath15 and for sufficiently large interaction at all finite temperatures .",
    "the ab - cdw consists of alternating sites with a particle density above ( below ) average .",
    "the order parameter @xmath16 is the absolute deviation of the particle density from its average @xcite .",
    "as far as the occurence of a symmetry broken phase is concerned , the model of spinless fermions at half - filling is similar to the hubbard model at half - filling which displays antiferromagnetic behavior .",
    "the main differences are that the broken symmetry for spinless fermions is discrete whereas it is continuous in the hubbard model , and the fact that a local interaction like the one in the hubbard model does not favor a spatial order by itself .",
    "the latter fact leads to a value of @xmath17 for large @xmath5 in the hubbard model whereas one has @xmath18 in the spinless fermions model .",
    "the article is organized as follows . succeeding this introduction it is discussed how a thermodynamically and analytically consistent extension of the limit @xmath19 can be performed .",
    "next the basic equations for the extension to linear order @xmath20 are derived and their numerical evaluation is sketched .",
    "this third section contains also results for the dos and the corresponding proper self - energy . in sect .",
    "4 the bethe - salpeter equation is set up and solved for the conductivity @xmath0 . the preservation of the f - sum rule is discussed .",
    "numerical results for the dc- and the ac - conductivity are presented in sect .",
    "the findings are summarized and dicussed in the final section .",
    "all energies ( temperatures , respectively ) throughout this article will be given in units of the root - mean - square of the `` free '' , i.e.  non - interacting , density - of - states of the lattice model concerned .",
    "all conductivities will be given in units of @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lattice constant .",
    "the constants @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( boltzmann s constant ) are set to unity .",
    "in the case @xmath25 , the evaluation of diagrams and the treatment of quantities like the dos is conceptually simple .",
    "it is always the leading contribution in @xmath20 and only this which must be kept .",
    "there is no dependence on the sequence in which certain quantities and the equations relating them are considered .",
    "all sum rules which hold in any dimension also hold at @xmath25 , continuity provided for the limit @xmath26 .",
    "this simplicity is lost as soon as corrections in @xmath20 are to be included . for concreteness ,",
    "let us consider the linear corrections @xmath20 ; the problems are illustrated for the free dos , the dyson equation and the free energy @xmath27 as function of the order parameter @xmath16 .",
    "the dos is a non - negative function of which the zeroth moment is unity .",
    "this holds in any dimension , hence in @xmath25 . on including the linear corrections",
    "@xcite one realizes that the approximate expression becomes negative at large values of @xmath28 .",
    "this is a disadvantage of the otherwise systematic expansion .",
    "another inconvenience catches the eye in fig .",

    ", we decide to use the exact finite dimensional dos , i.e. the @xmath6 dos .",
    "this procedure provides often even in @xmath29 a remarkable agreement @xcite . in @xmath6 ,",
    "this approximation yields qualitatively agreement for the local dos as compared to finite dimensional perturbation results @xcite .",
    "presently , the approach of using a finite dimensional dos in an otherwise infinite dimensional calculation as approximation for the finite dimensional problem is employed as so - called `` dynamical mean - field theory '' @xcite or `` local impurity self - consistent approximation '' @xcite .",
    "next the problem of a systematic @xmath20-expansion is discussed for the dyson equation .",

    "expression for @xmath31 since @xmath33 is not a linear function .",
    "the expansion of the self - energy seems more promising since it preserves the dyson equation by construction .",
    "moreover , it is able to describe the shift of singularities , e.g. the shifts of the band edges .",
    "( note that we discuss here finite expansions of the quantities considered ) .    in spite of the choice to expand the self - energy some ambiguity persists .",
    "( 8.2,7)(0,0.7 ) ( 8.3,0 )    in fig .",

    "two results for the dependence of the conjugated field on the order parameter are opposed .",
    "the data refers to the ab - cdw occuring in the spinless fermion problem at half - filling .",
    "the dotted curve results from a fully self - consistent calculation whereas the dashed curve results from a systematic expansion of the self - energy .",
    "note that the self - consistent approach generates higher order contributions .",
    "the argument results now from the strange behavior of the dashed curve in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "the free energy belonging to the dotted curve can be found by integration ; it has an unstable maximum ( @xmath35 ) at @xmath36 and two stable minima ( @xmath37 ) at @xmath38 .",
    "but there is no free energy belonging to the dashed curve since it would have three maxima in sequence around @xmath36 which is mathematically impossible ( theorem of rolle ) .",
    "this is a very strong argument in favor of a self - consistent calculation .    for completeness",
    ", it shall be mentioned that one may argue that in the vicinity of the physical solutions , i.e. the minima , the difference of both approaches is negligible .",
    "there are also cases known where the systematic , non self - consistent approach yields better results @xcite .",
    "but there is still another advantage of the self - consistent treatment which will be crucial for what follows . in the sense of baym / kadanoff @xcite it covers also the calculations of two - particle properties and ensures the preservation of sum rules",
    "so , schweitzer and czycholl resorted in their calulation of resistance and thermopower for the periodic anderson model to the self - consistent treatment @xcite although their results for the local dos did not necessarily favor this approach @xcite .",
    "as result of the above discussion the starting point for the inclusion of @xmath20 correction is the generating functional @xmath7 according to baym / kadanoff @xcite .",
    "this is the quantity which is expanded in a @xmath20 series .",

    "what matters , however , is the order relative to the free green function which is @xmath44 for adjacent sites .",

    "one obtains in the homogeneous phase @xmath52 by choosing an appropriate wave vector @xmath53 at fixed @xmath28 one can have the sign of @xmath54 such that the imaginary part of @xmath55 is positive @xcite .",
    "this is a contradiction to the exact result @xcite .",
    "note that the details of @xmath56 are not essential as long as the imaginary part is finite .",
    "the counter example above is not only of academic interest .",
    "schweitzer and czycholl observed as well that the inclusion of a nearest - neighbor self - energy leads to wrong signs of the imaginary parts .",
    "they considered the @xmath2 expansion of a @xmath57 perturbation theory around hartree - fock for the hubbard model and the periodic anderson model @xcite .",
    "they reached consistency by including higher @xmath2 corrections ( for @xmath29 up to 50 terms ) @xcite .",
    "problems with the analyticity ( uniqueness ) of the solution occurred also in the first investigations of @xmath2 corrections in the hubbard model @xcite ( falicov - kimball model @xcite ) .    to the author s knowledge",
    "there is no necessary or sufficient theory so far , which predicts under which circumstances such problems have to be expected or can be excluded .",
    "a sufficient argument excluding wrong signs of the imaginary part of the approximate self - energy is given by the theorem :    if the approximation considered can be interpreted as an expansion of the self - energy in a parameter @xmath58 and if @xmath59 is the leading order , in which the imaginary part of the self - energy does _ not _ vanish , then the self - energy approximated in the @xmath59-th order has the right sign .",
    "the proof relies on the continuity of limits if the expansion exists .",
    "according to the precondition holds @xmath60 which is equivalent to @xmath61 the index @xmath53 is the wave vector in a homogeneous , translationally invariant phase . the derivation for general phases , for instance the ab - cdw , is given in appendix a.    the derivation in ( [ gegen2 ] ) and in ( [ gegen3 ] ) holds strictly only for the non self - consistent treatment . in the generic situation ,",
    "however , the leading order of the self - energy with non - vanishing imaginary part results from a certain diagram class and the analytic properties do not depend on the specific form of the green function entering .",
    "if this is the case , the statement of the theorem extends also to the self - consistent treatment where the quantitative form of the green functions are not known a priori .",
    "the theorem helps one to understand the observations made by schweitzer and czycholl . in the @xmath2 expansion of the @xmath62-dimensional hubbard model and of the periodic anderson model one has @xmath63 and @xmath64 since the self - energy is imaginary already in the first order .",
    "for the perturbation theory in @xmath5 one has @xmath65 and @xmath66 since the self - energy stays real in hartree - fock . applying the rationale of the theorem",
    "twice one understands that the self - energy in @xmath57 of the infinite dimensional model has the right analytic behavior .",
    "if further @xmath2 corrections are included this does not need to be true .",
    "the result of schweitzer and czycholl , that the linear @xmath2 correction leads to wrong signs , proves that the theorem is sharp : if the precondition fails , the implication fails , too .",
    "the second obervation , that the inclusion of _ very many _",
    "@xmath2 correction terms remedies the failure , can also be understood easily . in this case",
    "the calculations approximates the @xmath57 perturbation theory of the _ finite _ dimensional models very well .",
    "according to the theorem , this perturbation theory displays the right sign , too .",
    "the above observations indicate that also the analyticity problems encountered for @xmath2 corrections in the hubbard model @xcite are not due to the approximations used to solve the effective impurity problems .",
    "rather each time that the theorem does not apply one has to expect that analyticity problems arise for certain parameters .",
    "considering eq .",

    "the argument runs at an arbitrary but fixed value of @xmath28 .",
    "according to the dyson equation one has @xmath242 the full green function can be written as @xmath243 , where the real and the imaginary parts are real , symmetric matrices .",
    "the same is true for the self - energy .",
    "let us define in particular @xmath244 .",
    "the aim is to show ( a ) that the leading order @xmath245 in @xmath246 of the matrix @xmath247 is positive semi - definite and ( b ) that this implies that all spectral densities are non negative .",
    "the main difference to the argument in the main part is that the matrices do not commute in general .",

    "this becomes @xmath257 the negative semi - definitenes of the l.  h.  s.  of ( [ aher4 ] ) implies the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath247 for values of @xmath28 which are no eigenvalues of @xmath241 .",
    "assuming continuity @xcite for @xmath258 the positive semi - definiteness extends to all frequencies .    addressing the sign of the imaginary part of the full green function we state that @xmath259 implies that there is a matrix @xmath260 which is real and symmetric as well . defining @xmath261 allows ( [ aher3 ] ) to be written as @xmath262 the expression in parentheses is manifestly positive semi - definite , thus its inverse as well .",

    "the prefactor compensates the fact that the end vertices do not have the factor @xmath279 which is incorporated in @xmath280 .",

    "partial integration of the last term of the numerator leads to ( [ wfsum1c ] ) .",
