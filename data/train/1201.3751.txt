    "quantum devices in silicon have been the subject of concentrated interest , both experimental and theoretical , in recent years .",
    "efforts to make such devices have led to atomically precise fabrication methods which incorporate phosphorus atoms in a single monolayer of a silicon crystal @xcite .",
    "these dopant atoms can be arranged into arrays @xcite , or geometric patterns for wires @xcite and associated tunnel junctions @xcite , gates , and quantum dots @xcite  all of which are necessary components of a functioning device @xcite .",
    "the patterns themselves define atomically abrupt regions of doped and undoped silicon . while silicon , bulk - doped silicon , and the physics of the phosphorus incorporation @xcite are well - understood , models of this quasi - two - dimensional phosphorus sheet are still in their initial stages .",
    "in particular , it is critical in many applications to understand the effect of this confinement on the conduction band valley degeneracy , inherent in the band structure of silicon .",
    "for example , the degeneracy of the valleys has the potential to cause decoherence in a spin - based quantum computer  @xcite , and the degree of valley degeneracy lifting ( valley splitting ) defines the conduction properties of highly confined planar quantum dots@xcite .",
    "the importance of understanding valley splitting in monolayer @xmath0-doped si : p structures has led to a number of theoretical works in recent years spanning several techniques , from pseudopotential theories via planar wannier orbital ( pwo ) bases @xcite , density functional theory ( dft ) via linear combination of atomic orbital ( lcao ) bases @xcite , to tight - binding ( tb ) models @xcite , and effective mass theories ( emt ) @xcite .",
    "we note that several of these papers are based upon the assumption that the effective masses of @xmath0-doped p in si remain unchanged from bulk - doped values;@xcite an assumption which has been challenged.@xcite others assume doping over a multi - atomic plane band@xcite which no longer represents the state of the art in fabrication .",
    "we also note that ref .",
    "represents the first attempt to model these devices by considering explicitly doped @xmath0-layers with dft , using a relatively small localized basis set with the assumption that a basis set sufficient to describe bulk silicon would also adequately describe p - doped si .",
    "there is currently little agreement between the valley splitting values obtained using these methods , with predictions ranging between 5 to 270 mev , depending on the arrangement of dopant atoms within the @xmath0-layer .",
    "density functional theory has been shown to be a useful tool in predicting how quantum confinement and/or doping perturbs the bulk electronic structure in silicon- and diamond - like structures,@xcite and it might be expected that the removal of the basis set assumption will lead to the best estimate of the valley splitting available .    in this paper",
    "we determine a consistent value of the valley splitting in explicitly @xmath0-doped structures by obtaining convergence between distinct dft approaches in terms of basis set and system sizes .",
    "we perform a comparison of dft techniques , involving localized numerical atomic orbitals and delocalized plane - wave ( pw ) basis sets .",
    "convergence of results with regard to the amount of si `` cladding '' about the @xmath0-doped plane is studied .",
    "this corresponds to the normal criterion of supercell size , where periodic boundary conditions may introduce artificial interactions between replicated dopants in neighboring cells .",
    "a benchmark is set via the delocalized basis for dft models of @xmath0-doped si : p against which the localized basis techniques are assessed .",
    "implications for the type of modeling being undertaken are discussed , and the models extended beyond those tractable with plane - wave techniques . using these calculations , we obtain converged values for properties such as bandstructures , energy levels , valley splitting , electronic densities of state and charge densities near the @xmath0-doped layer .    the paper is organized as follows : sec .",

    "an elucidation of effects modifying the bulk bandstructure follows in app .",
    "[ sec : bravais ] & [ sec : zfold ] to provide a clear contrast to the properties deriving from the @xmath0-doping of the silicon discussed in the paper .",
    "density functional theory calculations have been carried out using both plane - wave and lcao basis sets .",
    "for the plane - wave ( pw ) basis set , the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite software was used with projector augmented wave ( paw ) @xcite pseudopotentials for si and p. due to the nature of the plane - wave ( pw ) basis set , there exists a simple relationship between the cutoff energy and basis set completeness . for the structures considered in this work",
    ", the calculations were found to be converged for pw cutoffs of 450 ev .",
    "localized basis set calculations were performed using the spanish initiative for electronic simulations with thousands of atoms ( siesta ) @xcite software . in this case , the p and si ionic cores were represented by norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials.@xcite the kohn - sham orbitals were expanded in the default single-@xmath1 polarized ( szp ) or double-@xmath1 polarized ( dzp ) basis sets , which consist of 9 and 13 basis functions per atom respectively . both the szp and dzp sets contain @xmath2- , @xmath3- , and @xmath4-type functions .",
    "these calculations were found to be converged for a mesh grid energy cutoff of 300 ry . in all cases ,",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) pbe @xcite exchange - correlation functional was used .",
    "the lattice parameter for bulk si was calculated using an 8-atom cell , and found to be converged for all methods with a @xmath5 monkhorst  pack ( mp ) _",
    "k_-point mesh @xcite .",
    "the resulting values are presented in table [ tab : lattice ] , and were used in all subsequent calculations .       increasing the @xmath6-dimension of the cell leads to successive folding points being introduced as the brillouin zone ( bz ) shrinks along @xmath7 ( see app .",
    "[ sec : bravais ] ) .",
    "this has the effect of shifting the conduction band minima in the @xmath8 directions closer and closer to the @xmath9 point ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : folding ] ) and making the bandstructure extremely dense when plotting along @xmath7 .",
    "this results in the value of the lowest unoccupied eigenstate at @xmath9 being lowered as what were originally other sections of the band are successively mapped onto @xmath9 , and after a sufficient number of folds the value at @xmath9 is indistinct from the original conduction band minimum ( cbm ) value .",
    "the effects of this can be seen in table [ tab : bulksi ] , which describes increasingly elongated tetragonal cells of bulk si .",
    "when we then plot the bandstructure in a different direction , _ e.g. _ along @xmath10 , the translation of the minima from @xmath8 onto the @xmath9-point appear as a new band with two - fold degeneracy .",
    "the degeneracy of the original band drops from 6- to 4-fold , in line with the reduced symmetry ( we only explicitly calculate one , and the other three occur due to symmetry considerations ) .",
    "this is the origin of the `` @xmath9-bands '' discussed in refs . & .",
    "once the @xmath7 valleys are sited at @xmath9 , parabolic dispersion corresponding to the transverse kinetic energy terms is observed along @xmath10 and @xmath11 , at least close to the band minimum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : d0vasp ] ) .",
    "all methods considered in table [ tab : bulksi ] show the lumo at @xmath9 ( folded in along @xmath8 ) approaching the cbm value as the amount of cladding increases ; at 80 layers , the lumo at @xmath9 is within 1 mev of the cbm value .",
    "it is also of note that the pw indirect bandgap agrees well with the dzp value , and less so with the szp model .",
    "this is an indication that , although the behaviour of the lumo with respect to the cell shape is well - replicated , the szp basis set is demonstrably incomplete .",
    "conversely , pairwise comparisons between the pw and dzp results show agreement to within 5 mev .    it is important to distinguish effects indicating convergence with respect to cladding for doped cells ( _ i.e. _ elimination of layer - layer interactions ) from those mentioned above which derive from the shape and size of the supercell . strictly , the convergence ( with respect to the amount of encapsulating si ) of those results we wish to study in detail , such as the differences in energy between occupied levels in what was the bulk bandgap , provide the most appropriate measure of whether sufficient cladding has been applied .",
