    "_ spatial resolution _ is one of the key ingredients in nano - scale characterizations .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance + ( nmr ) , which is a powerful analytical tool to investigate structural and dynamical properties of materials , is less advantageous in this respect . to gain high spatial resolution in nmr , one needs to invoke some characteristic systems that are specially designed for this purpose .",
    "examples include magnetic resonance imaging microscopy@xcite and magnetic resonance force microscopy,@xcite where high spatial resolution is achieved by a strong magnetic field gradient that surpasses nmr line widths .",
    "this requirement , as well as that for high sensitivity to detect small number of nuclei in a small region , has posed serious challenges to these techniques .    in some cases , it is possible to identify signals from a part of a bulk material even in the absence of field gradients , by making use of the structural features .",
    "for example , at interfaces in composite materials , nuclear polarization can be transferred from one material to another . in this case , the transferred nuclear polarization is localized in proximity to the interfaces within the nuclear spin diffusion length , so that one can selectively detect nmr signals from that area .",
    "this can be referred to as _ interface - sensitive nmr_. the method is often combined with dynamic nuclear polarization or optical pumping .",
    "examples include solid surfaces adsorbed by hyperpolarized @xmath0xe gas @xcite , solvents in dynamically polarized solutions@xcite and interfaces between solid materials and semiconductors . @xcite    our current interest resides in the last case , especially that combined with the optical pumping.@xcite we proposed a",
    "_ nuclear spin polarizer _ ( nsp ) as a possible configuration of this kind,@xcite which utilize the successive polarization transfer scheme shown in fig .",
    "it is intended to enhance signals from a surface of a ( target ) material to which conventional dynamic nuclear polarization techniques are inapplicable . with the aid of an optically oriented semiconductor , nuclei in the target material",
    "are indirectly polarized .",
    "examples of the target include nano - structures built on semiconducting bulk materials , such as quantum dots on substrates .",
    "a typical configuration of the scheme is depicted in fig .",
    "[ illumination ] .",
    "here , we introduce a possible variation of the _ nuclear spin polarizer _ , i.e. , _ surface - sensitive nmr _ in optically pumped semiconductors . target nuclei ( @xmath1 ) are located at a surface of a bulk compound semiconductor , whose signals are detected apart from those in the rest of the material .",
    "a key feature of the scheme is that it utilizes the primary nuclei ( @xmath2 ) with a long spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath3 ( as is often the case in semiconductors ) as a polarization reservoir for the secondary ( target ) nuclei ( @xmath1 ) to be detected , which enables us to detect @xmath1 signals from the illuminated area selectively , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ss - nmr ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the conventional ( bulk ) nmr in a uniform magnetic field , where nuclei in the whole sample are excited and detected .",
    "the pulse sequence of the scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ sequence ] together with the time dependence of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 polarizations in both the illuminated area and the rest of the sample ( bulk ) .",
    "the sequence consists of the four processes .",
    "( 1 ) saturation ( sat ) : comb pulses made of trains of 90@xmath4-pulses are applied to both the nuclei to extinguish the initial polarizations in thermal equilibrium .",
    "( 2 ) optical pumping ( op ) : the infrared light is irradiated for the effective duration time of @xmath5 to create polarizations in the illuminated area . in this period",
    ", the @xmath1 polarization in the bulk may recover toward its thermal equilibrium value with the time scale of @xmath6 , while that of @xmath2 does not because @xmath7 is much longer than @xmath8 .",
    "( 3 ) cross polarization ( cp ) : the second sat pulse is applied for @xmath1 , which is followed by a cross polarization between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "the cp promotes polarization transfers in the illuminated area , but not in the bulk because the @xmath2 polarization is absent there .",
    "( 4 ) signal acquisition ( acq ) : only the @xmath1 signal in the illuminated area is detected in the final signal acquisition process .",
    "we have previously reported successive polarization transfer experiments in indium phosphide.@xcite here , we discuss the results in the context of the _ surface - sensitive nmr_. the sample used was a 350 @xmath9m - thick wafer of the semi - insulating iron - doped inp with the crystal orientation of ( 100 ) and the carrier density at room temperature @xmath10 @xmath11 . it was set with the surface normal to the magnetic field and a light beam .",
    "figure [ spectra ] shows three fourier - transform spectra of @xmath12 in at 6.346 t and 10 k. the spectrum ( a ) was obtained with the sequence sat@xmath13fid without ir irradiation , which represents a bulk @xmath12 in signal in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the spectrum ( b ) , on the other hand , was obtained with the sequence shown in fig .",
    "[ sequence ] with @xmath14p , @xmath15 in and @xmath5=120 s. the wavelength ( @xmath16 ) and helicity ( @xmath17 ) were set at 890 nm and @xmath18 , respectively , where the largest optical orientation effects were observed in both @xmath19p and @xmath12 in .",
    "since the photon energy is below the band gap , the penetration depth of the light may be as thick as a few tens of @xmath9 m .",
    "@xcite    the relaxation ( @xmath20 ) and the buildup ( @xmath21 ) times were reported to be @xmath22 s , @xmath23 s and @xmath24 s,@xcite hence the condition @xmath25 is satisfied . as a result ,",
    "transfer from the bulk @xmath2 spins is absent and the spectrum ( b ) represents only the signal from the illuminated area , as explained in fig . [ sequence ] ( b ) .",
    "the spectrum ( c ) was obtained with the same sequence as ( b ) but without light irradiation . since no polarization grows during @xmath26 , no signal intensity",
    "is observed in ( c ) .",
    "the total efficiency of the scheme , which is evaluated by the polarization of the target nuclei , is maximized by optimizing each of the polarization transfer processes . in the cross polarization process",
    ", the transferred polarization is generally expressed as,@xcite @xmath27 \\exp(-\\frac{\\tau_{cp}}{t_{1\\rho}^{i } } ) , \\label{ms}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the cross - relaxation time between @xmath2 and @xmath1 and the relaxation time of @xmath2 in the rotating flame , respectively . as is evident from ( [ ms ] ) , the cross - relaxation time ( @xmath28 ) should be faster than the relaxation time ( @xmath29 ) to minimize transfer loss during the cross polarization process .    the present material ( iron - doped inp )",
    "is fortunate in this respect .",
    "first , the relaxation in the rotation flame is negligible ( @xmath30 ) due mainly to the high crystal symmetry.@xcite secondly , the cross relaxation time is rather fast under the optical pumping condition . it was reported to be @xmath31 s,@xcite which is by an order of magnitude faster than that estimated for the nuclear dipolar couplings , because of the indirect @xmath32-couplings of the order of khz.@xcite .",
    "these result indicates that semi - insulating iron - doped inp is a good candidate for the _ nuclear spin polarizer_.",
    "in this article , we have described the scheme of the _ surface - sensitive nmr _ in optically pumped semiconductors and shown its feasibility with the example of inp wafers.@xcite the scheme provides a basis for the _ nuclear spin polarizer _ , an interface - sensitive nmr in optically pumped semiconductors .",
