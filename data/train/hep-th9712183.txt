    "gelfand and namark realized @xcite that a unital commutative @xmath0-algebra is essentially the same thing as a compact topological hausdorff space . in the sequel",
    "mathematicians have dropped commutativity and considered noncommutative @xmath0-algebras as something like noncommutative topological spaces .",
    "some highlights of this program are algebraic @xmath1-theory @xcite , cyclic cohomology @xcite and quantum groups @xcite .",
    "physicists however are confronted with measurements , that is the assignment of a set of real numbers to the system under consideration .",
    "these real numbers constitute a metric space or geometry .",
    "although topology has important applications to physics , geometry is indispensable .",
    "therefore , connes assignment @xcite of metric properties to noncommutative topological spaces is of paramount importance for physics .",
    "connes discovery was that geometry is encoded in the interplay between a @xmath2-algebra @xmath3 and some sort of dirac operator @xmath4 , both acting on a hilbert space @xmath5 .",
    "the collection @xmath6 of these data is called spectral triple .",
    "connes distance definition , applied to the spectral triple ( smooth functions on spin manifold @xmath7 , dirac operator of the spin connection , square integrable bispinors ) , recovers precisely @xcite the geodesic distance on @xmath7 .",
    "but the strength of connes definition is that it does not require the algebra @xmath3 to be commutative .",
    "moreover , it gives rise to an interesting geometry even on commutative algebras with noncommutative differential calculus , such as the famous two - point space @xcite .    in spite of these opportunities ,",
    "the interest of the physics community has moved more to the construction of differential calculi @xcite associated to spectral triples and to physical models @xcite based on them .",
    "the formost achievement along this line is a reformulation of the standard model @xcite in which yang  mills and higgs fields are parts of one generalized gauge potential .",
    "this leads to a genuine unification of yang  mills and higgs sectors of the standard model .",
    "however , i am not aware of an attempt to recover the metric structure associated to the standard model spectral triple , which is the concern of this paper .    technically , we do not strictly follow connes framework but employ the author s modification @xcite that uses lie algebras instead of associative @xmath2-algebras ( section [ fund ] ) .",
    "the lie algebraic framework has the advantage that every degree of freedom has a physical meaning , whereas in the @xmath2-algebra case one has additional parameters which at the very end are eliminated by skew - adjointness and unimodularity conditions .",
    "our procedure implements neither real structures @xcite nor all that sophisticated stuff like bivariant @xmath1-theory @xcite and noncommutative poincar duality , which according to connes @xcite are essential elements of noncommutative manifolds .",
    "we start with the pure matrix part of the standard model ( section [ matrix ] ) and find that its geometry is a nine - parametric family ( because there are nine massless yang ",
    "mills fields in the standard model ) of infinitely distant two - dimensional objects .",

    "the pure continuum case leads back to riemannian geometry ( section [ cont ] ) .",
    "thus , the geometry of the full standard model ( section [ full ] ) is of kaluza  klein type @xcite .",
    "it is a nine - parametric family of infinitely distant worlds .",
    "each world is six - dimensional ( see also @xcite ) , four dimensions are our usual spacetime and the other two are compactified to a certain gyro .",
    "this means that we do not confirm connes conjecture of a multi - sheeted structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "it is true that the geometry of the standard model differs from four dimensional riemannian geometry at energy scales of the order @xmath13 .",
    "but on each world the geometry remains continuously connected and can be described completely in terms of standard ( commutative ) geometry .",
    "this is also in contrast with noncommutative kaluza ",
    "klein theories developed by madore and mourad ( see @xcite for a review and references therein ) , where the internal coordinates are generators of a noncommutative algebra . we show that the geometry of the matrix part of the standard model ( which contains three massive yang  mills fields ) is a deformation of the 2-sphere @xmath14 .",
    "the spectral triple over the algebra @xmath15 studied first by connes and lott @xcite gives rise to one massive yang ",
    "mills field .",
    "therefore , its geometry is a deformed @xmath16 , i.e.  a pair of points .",
    "after taking spacetime into consideration , connes and lott thus obtained two copies of spacetime as geometry of this example .",
    "the possibility of endowing discrete spaces with geometry has been celebrated as a main achievement of noncommutative geometry . to my knowledge",
    ", one has widely believed that the discreteness of the @xmath15-example is typical for matrix spectral triples .",
    "but this is not the case , as the present paper shows .",
    "physical reasons ( the wish to describe other field theoretical models than the standard model ) led us to replace the associative @xmath2-algebra in connes noncommutative geometry by a lie algebra @xcite .",
    "then , the spectral triple or @xmath1-cycle describing the initial data becomes an @xmath17-cycle :    an @xmath17cycle @xmath18 over a skew  adjoint lie algebra @xmath19 is given by    an involutive representation @xmath20 of @xmath19 in the lie algebra @xmath21 of bounded operators on a hilbert space @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath22 , for any @xmath23 ,    a ( possibly unbounded ) selfadjoint operator @xmath4 on @xmath5 with compact resolvent such that @xmath24 \\in   \\mathcal{b}(\\mathcal{h})$ ] ,    a selfadjoint operator @xmath25 on @xmath5 , fulfilling @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28",

    "the first and most difficult part is to compute the norm of functionals @xmath30 on @xmath19 .",
    "the computation consists of two steps : that of the norm of @xmath86 and that of the extrema of @xmath87 . let @xmath88 , @xmath89 , be the eigenvalues of @xmath90 . as @xmath91 is tracefree",
    ", there are only the two possibilities @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it suffices to study the first case , because the second case goes into the first one by inversion @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath95 denoting @xmath96 , the eigenvalues of @xmath86 are @xmath97 times @xmath98 so that the norm ( = absolute value of the largest eigenvalue ) becomes @xmath99    for the further evaluation we draw the ` left ' graphs @xmath100 , @xmath101 and the ` right ' graphs @xmath102 , @xmath103 into a @xmath104-@xmath105-diagram .",

    "the extrema are again attained at the boundaries @xmath143 ( superscript @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 ( superscript @xmath146 ) , see .",
    "this gives the following absolute values : @xmath147 after selecting the strongest constraints we find for @xmath148 @xmath149 the requirement @xmath150 yields the following constraints : @xmath151 where at least one of these constraints must be an equality .",
    "the first conclusion is @xmath152 , which we satisfy by @xmath153 this gives with @xmath154 the equation @xmath155 which leads ( for the admissible range of @xmath9 to be specified below ) to @xmath156 what we obtain is thus a pair of paraboloids , which we can parametrize as follows : @xmath157 however , we still have to take the condition @xmath158 into account , which is the 2-sphere of radius @xmath31 .",

    "see that the left and right norms are identical and equal to the right norm in .",
    "the table corresponding to table [ table ] reads : @xmath258 this yields @xmath259 thus , @xmath260 is bounded up to the scale factor @xmath261 by the spacetime distance @xmath262 , where @xmath261 becomes @xmath31 only on the boundary of the parameter region @xmath263 of allowed gyros ( figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "if we now rise @xmath264 , then the distance will also grow at first due to the part @xmath265 in .",
    "but very soon this growth is compensated by the necessity to decrease @xmath266 at expense of the growth of @xmath267 .",
    "we have @xmath268 for @xmath269 , see .",
    "this means @xmath270 and we find the final result @xmath271 the precise value of @xmath272 is not so important , its boundedness suffices for a physical discussion .",
    "note that @xmath273 .",
    "no measurement device for macroscopic distances has a precision of @xmath274 .",
    "hence , for geodesic distances @xmath262 of atomic size or larger , the geometry of the standard model is in accurate agreement with @xmath261 times the riemannian geometry of the underlying manifold . at scales of the order of the inverse top quark mass",
    "however , corresponding to energies of the order @xmath275 , spacetime should reveal a completely different structure . that what macroscopically is a point becomes an extended object   a gyro .",
    "as we have seen , there is a nine - parametric family of infinitely distant worlds ( or universes ) whose points ( on macroscopic scales ) are gyros ( on scales @xmath12 ) .",
    "the scale factor @xmath261 is constant on each world . at first glance , this unobserved scale factor @xmath261 seems to favour the conclusion that in our world values for @xmath276 are realized which are on the boundary of the allowed values ( figure [ fig ] ) .",
    "this means that the gyros would be degenerated to strings or lenses",
    ". however , we should remember that we can not see the `` actual '' spacetime manifold @xmath7 .",
    "all our measurements are only able to detect the `` derived '' geometry , which is @xmath261 times the true one . and",
    "as the actual manifold is not relevant , there is no problem in saying that the true geometry is @xmath277 times the measured geometry .",
    "this means that any of the allowed values for @xmath196 according to figure [ fig ] ( except @xmath278 ) could be realized in our universe",
    ". the laws of physics should be the same on each world except for effects due to different scale factors @xmath261 , which certainly lead to different `` constants '' of nature .",
    "this picture of the geometry of our world is probably not ultimate knowledge .",
    "the standard model is in accurate agreement with experiment only because today s experiments have a maximal resolution of the order @xmath274 . at this resolution , spacetime consists of gyros .",
    "but this does not exclude the possibility that at higher resolutions the gyros show a fine structure in the sense that each of its points is a higher dimensional object itself .",
    "grand unified theories for example contain further massive yang ",
    "mills fields and a plenty of additional higgs fields .",
    "we therefore expect that further dimensions become apparent at gut scales @xmath279 .    in other words ,",
    "we recover the old kaluza ",
    "klein idea @xcite of additional spacetime dimensions , which are compactified to very small size so that they are not apparent in every day s life .",
    "the attempt to deduce the fundamental interactions from higher dimensional riemannian geometry has a long history @xcite . but this approach has a severe shortcoming .",
    "one has to make a guess for the higher dimensional spacetime and then to reduce dimensions in order to obtain an effective theory in four dimensions .",
    "although manton has already found @xcite the six - dimensional geometry of the salam - weinberg model ( which in some sense coincides with our result ) , this trial - and - error method was not very effective after all .",
    "we simply took the other direction : we started from the experimentally well - confirmed standard model ( lie algebra , fermionic hilbert space , fermionic mass matrix ) and computed directly the corresponding small scale geometry .",
    "the essential progress ( apart from its effectiveness ) of our method lies in the fact that it implements chiral fermions from the very beginning   an obstacle for traditional kaluza",
    " klein theories .",
    "moreover , we obtain a geometric interpretation of the unbroken symmetries : they parametrize the copies of the world .",
    "now the question arises : what was wrong with previous kaluza  klein theories ?  the physical interpretation !",
    "one has mostly attempted to identify the additional dimensions with yang ",
    "mills fields .",
    "this is correct in so far as the gyros are hypersurfaces in @xmath201 , because the standard model contains three massive yang ",
    "mills fields .",
    "a different explanation is that the gyros are deformations of the @xmath280-sphere @xmath281 , which could be related to the spontaneously broken symmetry group .",
    "but the size and shape of the gyros are fixed , there is no geometry other than dimension related to yang ",
    "mills fields .",
    "the geometry of the gyros is rather related to the higgs field .",
    "this becomes apparent if one adopts ideas of the chamseddine ",
    "connes approach of noncommutative geometry @xcite .",
    "there , one studies the spectral geometry of the full dirac operator @xmath282 which includes yang  mills fields and higgs fields .",
    "let us drop the yang ",
    "mills fields .",
    "any noncommutative formulation of the standard model tells us that the dirac ",
    "higgs operator is obtained from the dirac ",
    "yukawa operator by replacing all fermion masses @xmath283 by @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the higgs field whose vacuum expectation value @xmath286 equals @xmath31 .",
    "now , the distance scale on the gyro becomes @xmath287 instead of @xmath12 , and is therefore subject to change if the higgs field varies .",
    "thus , we handle the gyros on the same footing as riemannian spaces @xmath7 .",
    "introducing coordinates @xmath288 on @xmath7 , the distance between points @xmath289 is not the euclidean distance @xmath290 but obtained on infinitesimal level by taking the metric tensor @xmath291 into consideration , @xmath292 . just as the higgs field on the rigid gyro , the metric tensor determines the scale on the rigid coordinate space . the analogy between metric tensor and higgs field as the scale on coordinate space goes further : both have non - vanishing vacuum expectation value : @xmath293 ( or @xmath294 in euclidean framework ; @xmath295 is the minkowski tensor ) and @xmath296 .",
    "the diameter of the gyro is determined by the inverse top quark mass or , equivalently @xcite , by the inverse mass of the higgs boson ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "our analogy then implies that the diameter of the coordinate space of the four dimensional manifold should be of the order of the inverse mass of the graviton , and therefore equal to infinity .",
    "this explains why four coordinates are expanded whereas the internal coordinates are compactified .",
    "einstein told us @xcite that masses determine the geometry of spacetime   on large scales .",
    "our result is the inverse : the small scale structure of spacetime ( gyros ) tells us that there exist massive particles in the universe . is nt this a beautiful interplay between large and small scales ?",
    "the small scale structure of spacetime generates the masses which in turn generate the large scale structure .",
    "we live on one specific world of the nine - parametric family",
    ". we can not establish any contact with the other universes , we nevertheless know of their existence : the nine massless yang ",
    "mills fields occurring in our ( and any other ) world are the carriers of this global information .",
    "all gyros of our world have the same shape , denoted by @xmath297 .",
    "the information about this shape ( better : of the object that replaces the gyro at gut - energies ) and about the four - dimensionality of the underlying manifold must have been present as early as the big bang . as already stressed , the _ shape _ @xmath298 ( or @xmath299 ? ) is fixed forever , that what evolves is the _",
    "scale_. big bang singularity means that the distance between any points on @xmath298 becomes zero , because @xmath300 and @xmath285 diverge .",
    "this behavior is very similar to a correlation length that diverges at a critical point ."
