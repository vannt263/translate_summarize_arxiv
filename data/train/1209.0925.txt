    "nature is full of randomness , from nucleus to whole galaxy , from inorganism to organism and from the domain of science and technology to the human society @xcite .",
    "although the mechanisms of randomness are different from one field to another , the ways to describe them are similar .",
    "the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) is a good approach to describe the randomness .",
    "the earliest work on sdes was done to describe brownian motion in einstein s famous paper and at the same time by smoluchowski .",
    "later it and stratonovich put sdes on a more solid theoretical foundation . in 1908 , a french physicist , paul langevin , developed an equation called the langevin equation ( le ) thereafter , which incorporated a random force into the newton equation , to describe the brownian motion .",
    "langevin equation is an equation to mechanics using simplified models and using sdes to account for omitted degrees of freedom .",
    "there are many branches with rich contents which have been derived in the last 100 years .",
    "for example , the reaction kinetic dynamics in chemistry @xcite , the molecular motor and protein folding in biology @xcite , the intracellular and intercellular calcium signaling , quantum brownian motion and the stochastic quantization in physics @xcite , even the stock market fluctuations and crashes @xcite are all related to the langevin equation .",
    "the langevin equation plays an important role in modern science , however only a few of them can be analytically solved , thus it is necessary to develop a numerical algorithm which incorporates both the computation efficiency and accuracy .",
    "the general structure of the stochastic differential equation is @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2s are the deterministic part of the equations of motion , @xmath3s are the diffusion coefficients and @xmath4s are a set of independent gaussian random variables with correlation function @xmath5    to get a certain order algorithm for the sde , we can directly do the stochastic taylor expansion of eq.(1 ) to our desired accuracy @xcite .",
    "this method is very explicit and suits for many cases of the sdes , however , since this expansion is too laborious to generate to high orders , we need to find a systematic pattern to overcome such difficulty . in this paper",
    ", we use the bicolour rooted tree method ( brt ) based on the stochastic taylor expansion to obtain the high order algorithm for sdes systematically .    in the field of numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations , j. c. butcher develops a rooted tree method which relates each term in the ordinary taylor expansion to a rooted tree @xcite .",
    "his method can excellently make the laborious ordinary taylor expansion systematic in a heuristic way .",
    "then k. burrage and p. m. burrage expand the rooted - tree method to the bicolour rooted tree method which relates each term in the stochastic taylor expansion to a bicolour rooted tree @xcite for the sake of solving sde .",
    "they give an explicit runge - kutta method of order 2.5 in their paper for the sde . in this paper",
    ", we further develop their works , propose a new type of the bicolour rooted tree method , and apply it to the le case .    since the intricacy of the numerical method for sde , the order of it is heretofore not great than 2.5 @xcite .",
    "but for some special kinds of the sde , for example , the langevin equation , a high order algorithm can be acquired .",
    "hershkovitz has developed a fourth order algorithm for the le @xcite , which is based on the stochastic taylor expansion . in this paper",
    ", we use the brt method to improve the accuracy to order 7 of deterministic part and order 4.5 of stochastic part ( _ o_(7,4.5 ) ) .    in section 2",
    ", we briefly introduce the brt method and explore the relation between the terms in the stochastic taylor expansion and the bicolour rooted trees .",
    "we find that the stochastic taylor expansion is just equal to the sum of all the non - isomorphic bicolour rooted trees . in section 3 , due to the structure of le , we can use the brt method to obtain our algorithm _",
    "o_(7,4.5 ) for the le . in section 4 ,",
    "we use two examples to verify the validity and demonstrate the versatility of our algorithm .",
    "the first one is the energy relaxation in the double well .",
    "we compare our results with the previous results obtained by other algorithms and show the convergence of these different algorithms .",
    "the second one we present an algorithm for the time - dependent langevin equation with the ornstein - uhlenbeck noise , and our results are readily agreed with the previous ones .",
    "to cope with the intricacy of the taylor expansion of sde , a method which is called bicolour rooted tree method ( brt ) @xcite based on the rooted tree method @xcite developed by j. c. butcher is introduced to conveniently do the stochastic taylor expansion of sde .",
    "let us firstly transform the eq.(1 ) into the following equation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wiener process , and the symbol @xmath8 implies that the sde considered in this paper is in the stratonovich sense , for the stratonovich integral satisfies the usual rules of calculus @xcite .",
    "one can therefore integrate eq.(3 ) from 0 to h , @xmath9 taylor expansion of the functions gives , @xmath10 @xmath11 now taking the last two equations into eq.(4 ) , one can easily get @xmath12 where @xmath13 and the repeated indices except @xmath14 ( the number of the equations ) imply the einstein s summation convention throughout the paper .    then the terms with 0th derivative in eq.(7 )",
    "are , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , so @xmath18 , substituting it for eq.(7 ) gives the 1st derivative terms , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the stratonovich multiple integral @xcite , and the integration is with respect to ds if @xmath21 or @xmath22 if @xmath23 , for example , @xmath24 replacing eq.(7 ) by @xmath25 , one can get the 2nd derivative terms @xmath26 and performing this procedure recursively will generate all the derivative terms in principle .",
    "however , close calculation of these derivative terms reveals that the complexity will increase drastically as the order rises .",
    "for this reason , we adopt the brt method developed by j. c. butcher and p. m. burrage to express each derivative term systematically and graphically .",
    "we will first introduce some useful notations @xcite .",
    "take the bicolour rooted tree _ t _ in fig.1 as an example , the tree has 8 vertices , each vertex can be colored by white node ( @xmath8 ) or black node ( @xmath27 ) which is the representative of stochastic node ( @xmath28 ) or deterministic node ( @xmath29 ) . if @xmath30 are bicolour rooted trees , then @xmath31 $ ] and @xmath32 are trees in which @xmath30 are each joined by a single branch to @xmath27 or @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "we can therefore rewrite the tree _",
    "t _ in a compact form @xmath33]$ ] . to conveniently calculate the weight of this tree ,",
    "we define the following terms : the _ degree _ of the vertex @xmath34 in the brt is equivalent to the degree of vertex @xmath35 in the graph theory except the root 1 with @xmath36 .",
    "s is the _ symmetry factor _ of the tree _",
    "t _ , for example , the trees interchanged the branches joint to vertex 1 or 3 or 5 are regarded as identical with tree _ t _ ,",
    "therefore the symmetry factor of tree _",
    "t _ is @xmath37 . then tracing the stochastic taylor expansion of the eq.(7 ) , we find that the _ elementary weight _ of the tree , which is also the coefficient of each term in the expansion , is @xmath38 where n is the total number of vertex in the tree and vertex @xmath39 .",
    "now we introduce the _ elementary derivative _ and _ elementary integral _ here @xcite .",
    "an elementary derivative @xmath40 can be associated with a brt such that @xmath41 , t=[t_{1},\\cdots , t_{m}]\\\\ g^{(m)}[f(t_{1}),\\cdots , f(t_{m } ) ] , t=\\{t_{1},\\cdots , t_{m}\\ } , \\end{cases } \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the elementary integral can be written as @xmath42\\\\ \\int_{0}^{s}\\circ dw_{i}(u)(\\prod\\limits_{j=1}^{m}\\theta_{u}(t_{j})),t=\\{t_{1},\\cdots , t_{m}\\}. \\end{cases } \\end{split}\\ ] ] fig.1(a ) illustrates the elementary weight , derivative and integral graphically .    , derivative @xmath40 and integral @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "fig.1(b ) shows the 0th and 1st derivative terms of stochastic taylor expansion of @xmath44 by the brt method.,width=377 ]    therefore the stochastic taylor expansion is given by @xmath45 where t is the set of non - isomorphic bicolour rooted trees .",
    "fig.1(b ) illustrates how to use this formula to express @xmath46 .",
    "due to the complexity of stochastic taylor expansion , we only consider langevin equation ( le ) which plays an important part in the fields involving randomness in this paper .",
    "an n dimensional set of coupled les has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the external potential , @xmath49 is a set of friction parameters , @xmath4 is random noise with zero mean , the correlation relation is @xmath50 and the hamilton canonical equations are @xmath51 the form of eq.(17 ) where only every second equation has a noise term with constant diffusion coefficient , as well as the potential @xmath48 is unrelated to @xmath52 , makes it possible to sharply decrease the complexity of eq.(14 ) so as to obtain a high order algorithm for le .    for the eq.(17 ) , we can translate it into the form @xmath53 where @xmath2 is equal to @xmath54 for odd _",

( b)for the stochastic part :    ( i)write down all the non - isomorphic bicolour rooted trees that can avoid the structure ( 19 ) ;    ( ii)attach each vertex with white or black so as to make the tree have order n.
