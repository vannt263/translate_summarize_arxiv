    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are accreting binaries in which a late - type , usually dwarf star , donates mass via roche - lobe overflow to a white dwarf ( wd ) . in x - ray surveys ,",
    "the occurrence of different classes of cvs is correlated with the magnetic properties of the wd . at hard x - ray energies ( @xmath1  kev ) , the population of cvs is dominated by magnetic systems , principally intermediate polars ( ips , or dq herculis stars ) , but also polars ( am herculis stars ) . in polars ,",
    "the magnetic field is strong enough to channel matter directly from the companion , along a narrow stream , onto the magnetic pole(s ) of the wd . in the ips ,",
    "the magnetic field is not strong enough to prevent the formation of an accretion disk , but the disk terminates at a magnetospheric boundary ; here again , matter is channeled onto the magnetic pole(s ) of the wd .",
    "an ip is distinguished by its wd spin period , evident as a coherent oscillation in x - ray or optical emission from the rotating hot spot , at a shorter period than the orbital period of the binary .",
    "sometimes the beat period between the spin and orbit periods is seen , due to reprocessed emission . in polars ,",
    "the wd rotates synchronously with the binary orbit , or nearly so in the case of the few asynchronous polars ( aps ) .",
    "polars are also characterized by strong optical polarization , unlike the ips .",
    "x - ray spectra of cvs are correlated with their magnetic properties .",
    "the hard x - ray properties of magnetic cvs were reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "their thermal bremsstrahlung x - ray emission presumably originates from the gravitational energy radiated in the shocked accretion column just above the surface of the wd , which accounts for the dominance of this class in hard x - ray ( @xmath2  kev ) surveys , such as those conducted by the  burst alert telescope ( bat ) and .",
    "70-month hard x - ray survey @xcite lists 55 cvs , of which 41 are magnetic : 31 ips and 10 polars . of the 33 cvs in the the fourth ibis / isgri catalog @xcite , 25 are ips and four are polars .",
    "the ips outnumber the polars in hard x - ray surveys , presumably because of their higher accretion rates , and also because in polars the accretion may be more `` blobby , '' depositing some fraction of the energy directly onto the surface of the wd .",
    "the later hypothesis is motivated by observed blackbody radiation from polars with temperatures of tens of ev .",
    "thus , the polars sometimes have two - component , soft and hard spectra , which explains why many were discovered in the soft x - ray survey of the  satellite .    here",
    "we report on ground - based optical studies of ten cvs discovered by either _ asca _ , /bat , or .",
    "as one might expect from the discussion above , nearly all these show evidence of being magnetic , such as relatively strong he  ii  @xmath34686 emission caused by x - ray photoionization , or coherent oscillations .",

    "high cadence photometry was carried out on six targets to search for spin periods that would originate from an ip .",
    "five of these stars were observed with the the 1.3 m , and a sixth with the 2.4  m. all ten of our radial velocity studies to search for the orbital periods used the 2.4 m .      for the time - series photometry in 20082012",
    ", we used the thinned , back - illuminated site ccd `` templeton , '' a @xmath4 chip with @xmath5 m pixels . in order to minimize readout time , the ccd was windowed and binned @xmath6 to cover @xmath7 with @xmath8 pixels .",
    "exposure times ranged from 1030  s with a dead - time between exposures of only 3.6  s. for relatively blue stars we used a schott bg38 filter to maximize throughput , while a reddened star required an @xmath9 filter for optimal signal .",
    "standard reductions used bias frames and sky flats , and aperture photometry was performed with the iraf routine phot and a single comparison star that was 23 magnitudes brighter than the variable .",
    "@xcite standard stars were used to calibrate the @xmath9-band frames . for the bg38 filter ,",
    "an approximate magnitude was derived by averaging the @xmath10 and @xmath9 magnitudes of the comparison star in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite .    starting in 2013 we obtained time - series photometry with the 1.3-m telescope and an ikon du-937n ccd camera built by andor technology plc .",
    "this integrated unit employs a thinned , backside - illuminated frame - transfer ccd with 13  @xmath11 m square pixels and a @xmath12 active area that subtends @xmath13 at the 1.3-m . with @xmath14 binning ,",
    "the pixel scale was @xmath15  pixel@xmath16 .",
    "individual exposures were 1030 seconds .",
    "we used schott glass gg420 or bg38 filters , or a @xmath17-band filter .",
    "the dead time between exposures was only 11.92 milliseconds .",
    "the sensor was thermoelectrically cooled to @xmath18 c for all observations .",
    "the andor _ solis _ software recorded each observation sequence as a data cube , giving only a start time and an inter - frame interval rather than a separate start time for each image ; extensive tests showed that the nominal inter - frame interval was sufficiently accurate for our purposes . to reduce the data cubes , we subtracted median bias images and median dark images ( scaled by exposure times ) , and divided by normalized median images of the twilight sky in the appropriate filter",
    ". we again measured magnitudes using phot , and referred these to a comparison star in the field . for the gg420 filter , this was the @xmath9 magnitude of the comparison star in the usno - b1.0 .",
    "the comparison star light curves often showed variations due to clouds , but these were for the most part thin enough that the differential photometry was usable .",
    "sequences on individual stars ranged from 2.46.5 hours .",
    "period searches used a standard power spectrum analysis on these evenly sampled light curves . in two cases a slow trend was fitted out before calculating the power spectrum of the `` detrended '' light curve .",
    "nearly all of our radial velocity studies on the 2.4 m used the modular spectrograph .",
    "the detector was one of two thinned site ccds , either `` echelle '' , a @xmath19 chip that covered @xmath20    at 2.0    pixel@xmath16 , or `` templeton '' , the aforementioned @xmath4 chip that covered @xmath21    with the same dispersion .",
    "wavelength calibrations were from hg , ne , and xe comparison lamps taken during twilight , and we used the night - sky @xmath22 feature to track spectrograph flexure during the night . when it was clear , we observed flux standards during evening and morning twilight to calibrate the instrument response , but photometric conditions did not always prevail for our program - star observations , and seeing variations caused an an unknown fraction of the light to be lost on the jaws of the @xmath23 ( projected ) slit .",
    "experience suggests that the fluxes in our average spectra are typically accurate to @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , our modular spectrograph setup sometimes produces unrealistic continua , which fortunately tend to average out over many exposures .",
    "our slit was oriented north - south by default ",
    "parallel to atmospheric dispersion on the meridian . at large hour angles and zenith distances , we rotated the instrument to orient the slit close to the parallactic angle , rather than @xmath25 , so there is no large `` flat spot '' around the zenith as there is with extinction . ]",
    "this was often needed , because we were trying to find orbital periods ; observations far from the meridian are required in order to suppress ambiguities in the daily cycle count .",
    "( for one target , , we could not optimize the slit position angle because we needed to avoid a nearby brighter star . )    our 2012 december velocities of  are from the modular spectrograph mounted on the 1.3 m telescope .",
    "the setup and procedures were identical to those used at the 2.4 m , except that we did not rotate the instrument to the parallactic angle .",
    "the 1.3 m and 2.4 m telescopes are both @xmath26 , so the image scale of the 1.3 m is proportionally smaller than that of the 2.4 m . because the same physical slit size was used on both telescopes , the projected slit width was larger at the 1.3 m .",
    "consequently , alignment with the parallactic angle is less critical than with the larger telescope .",
    "we reduced our spectra using standard iraf and pyraf routines for bias subtraction , flatfielding , wavelength calibration , and flux calibration .",
    "to extract one - dimensional spectra , we used an implementation of the algorithm published by @xcite .",
    "we measured emission - line radial velocities using convolution algorithms described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "when a cool star was detectable in the spectrum , we used the @xcite implementation of the @xcite cross - correlation to measure its velocity ; for the template , we used a velocity - compensated sum of 76 observations of late g and early k - type iau velocity standards . to measure synthetic magnitudes from our spectra we used the @xcite tabulation of the @xmath17 passband and the iraf _",
    "sbands _ task .",
    "the main purpose of our spectroscopy was to determine the periodicity in the radial velocities ( which is identical to the orbital period @xmath27 in nearly all cases ) .",
    "we searched for periods in the time series using a `` residual - gram '' algorithm @xcite .",
    "the observability constraints imposed on observations from a single site inevitably lead to some ambiguity in the daily cycle count ; when these appeared significant , we used the monte carlo method of @xcite to assess the robustness of our choice of orbital period .",
    "we use the  discriminatory power \" statistic from that test , which is the fraction of monte carlo trials that result in the correct period being chosen , and not an alias , by virtue of having the smallest residuals .",
    "targets for this study were selected via a variety of methods that were likely to yield magnetic cvs . these include followup  observations showing periodicities from _ asca _ sources in the galactic plane ,",
    "bat sources for which pointed observations with the xrt found rapidly varying x - rays and a relatively bright or blue optical counterpart , and  sources already identified spectroscopically as cvs . in this section",

    "@xcite give coordinates and a finding chart for the wrong star ; fig .  1 and table 1 give the correct identification . our spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montage1 ] ) appears nearly identical to theirs , but with a slightly lower continuum level and better signal - to - noise ratio . in agreement with @xcite",
    "we see he  ii @xmath28 at less than half the strength of h@xmath29 ; our signal - to - noise reveals he  ii @xmath35411 as well , with an emission equivalent width ( ew ) of @xmath30  .",

    "our spectrum implies @xmath37 ; taking @xmath38 gives an extinction - corrected @xmath39 .",
    "the object lies at galactic coordinates @xmath40 , so the sizeable reddening is not unexpected .",
    "the object appears to be a novalike variable of some kind . at a distance of 1  kpc , it would have @xmath41 , comparable to other novalike variables @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate @xmath42 and @xmath43 pc for this object ( their table 2 ) ; the substantial reddening we find , and the similarity to a novalike variable , suggest that they underestimate both these quantities .",
    "our h@xmath44 emission velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montage1 ] ) did not yield an unambiguous orbital period , but we do detect a significant periodicity consistent with either @xmath45 d ( 3.87  cycle  d@xmath16 ) or @xmath46  d ( 4.98  cycle  d@xmath16 ) .",
    "these are daily cycle count aliases .",
    "we also do not know how many cycles elapsed between our observing runs .",
    "we are at least confident that the orbital period is longward of the 23  hr `` gap '' in the cv period distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig:0457pulse_jan ] shows a 6.8-hour photometric sequence we obtained with the andor camera on 2013 january  4 , using a gg420 filter .",
    "the magnitude scale is calibrated to the @xmath9 magnitude of the comparison star from the usno - b1.0 catalog .",
    "the main period detected is @xmath47 s , which is likely to be the rotation period of a magnetized white dwarf ( or possibly half the period ) .",
    "detrending the data with a 0.258-d period improves the power spectrum slightly .",
    "the night was mostly clear , though the comparison star showed evidence of occasional light clouds .",
    "the 1208-s period was not detected on two subsequent nights , but our observations were shorter then , and we used a bg38 filter , which proved to be less sensitive than the gg420 .",
    "we obtained additional time series with the same setup on 2013 march 13 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0457pulse_mar ] ) .",
    "these displayed the periodic signal very clearly , and a coherent fit to the three consecutive nights yields @xmath48  s , which we adopt as the most precise value .",
    "there is no evidence from the folded light curves that the true period is twice this value .",
    "@xcite suggested that the system is not magnetic , on the basis of its relatively weak he  ii emission , but the detection of a coherent modulation shows that it actually is magnetic .",
    "we have examined the existing  and  xrt data on , but they are too sparse to reveal the period .      a flurry of discovery surrounded this source in early 2006 .",
    "first , @xcite detected it using the  burst alert telescope ( bat ) and suggested it was identical to a  source coincident with a @xmath49 mag star .",
    "@xcite found emission lines , confirming the identification ; @xcite found a periodic modulation at 512.42(3 ) s , and pulsations at the same frequency were soon found by @xcite using the  xrt , confirming the ip nature of the source .",
    "further confirmation of the spin period was found by @xcite in _ rxte _ data .",
    "@xcite also obtained a spectrum showing a strong g - type stellar contribution to the spectrum , but were unable to detect the ellipsoidal modulation that would be expected if the g - star were the secondary .",
    "the puzzle of the missing ellipsoidal modulation was resolved when @xcite found the purported counterpart to be a close optical pair , with the fainter of the two stars being the bluer , pulsating object .",
    "@xcite found significant emission line velocity variations , but were unable to determine a period .",
    "we then obtained more extensive velocities and found the 0.2335-d period reported briefly in @xcite .",
    "we present these observations in greater detail here .    the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montage1 ] ) shows relatively weak emission , with he  ii  @xmath50 around the same strength as h@xmath29 . there is a broad bump in the continuum between 5000   , and 6200   , but we can not be sure this is real ; the strong upsweep into the blue also appears unphysical . because of the crowding star , we were uanble to follow our usual practice of keeping the slit near the parallactic angle ; instead , we used slit position angles between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "close examination of the spectrum reveals weak , stationary absorption features around @xmath53 , which we believe are from the crowding star ; the crowding star may also be responsible for the continuum bump .",

    ", we ( 1 ) rectified our spectra to the continuum , ( 2 ) hand - edited the individual spectra to remove radiation events and other artifacts , ( 3 ) constructed each line of the image from a weighted average of spectra close to the phase represented by that line cycles , truncated @xmath54 cycles from the central phase . ] , and ( 4 ) stacked the lines to form the two - dimensional image .",
    "there is a rather faint double - peaked profile , with a modest velocity amplitude , and a stronger component that undergoes an `` s - wave '' modulation between the velocities of the peaks .",
    "this may arise in a hot spot , where the mass - transfer stream strikes the accretion disk . on the other hand ,",
    "the sizeable radial velocity amplitude is reminiscent of an am  her star ( or polar ) , in which there is no accretion disk and therefore no hot spot . in polars",
    ", the accretion column produces large infall velocities , and hence strong velocity modulation , but the line profile does not support this interpretation . am  her stars tend to show broad , asymmetric line wings , which move with the orbit ( as in swift j2218 , section  [ sec : swift2218 ] ) .",
    "these are not seen here , so this appears not to be a polar .",
    "we obtained three sets of @xmath55 images on 2006 march 13 ut , with the 2.4 m telescope .",
    "conditions were photometric , and the seeing was @xmath56 , which was good enough to resolve the x - ray source from the nearby star , as shown in an @xmath57-band image in figure  [ fig : charts ] . to measure magnitudes , we used the iraf implementation of daophot , which fits point spread functions . the position in table [ tab : objects ]",

    "we are not aware of any prior optical work on .    its spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : montage1 ] ) , includes a significant contribution from a late - type secondary star as well as the typical emission lines .",
    "the secondary s velocities give period near 9  hr , which we refined over several observing runs to 0.39101(1 )  d. the emission - line velocities are much less steady , but corroborate the absorption - line period ( and eliminate the possibility that the absorption lines are from a distant companion to the binary , or chance superposition ) .    by scaling and subtracting spectra of stars classified by @xcite , and searching for good cancellation of the secondary s features , we determined the secondary s spectral type to be k4 @xmath65 2 subclasses , and quantified its contribution to the spectrum .",
    "we then computed a distance based on the following procedure , which is described in more detail by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( 1 ) the roche - lobe constraints and @xmath27 determine the physical size of the secondary ( with a weak dependence on the secondary s assumed mass ) .",
    "( 2 ) the secondary s spectral type determines its surface brightness .",
    "( 3 ) the spectral decomposition gives an apparent magnitude for the secondary s contribution .",
    "( 4 ) we correct for reddening , and determine the distance .",
    "all of these steps involve uncertainties ; a crude estimate of the uncertainty in the final distance can be had by propagating the errors in the standard manner , and that is the procedure we have followed in the past .",
    "this is not entirely satisfactory , because some of the parameters can be correlated .",
    "most importantly , metal lines are stronger at later spectral types , so normalization of the secondary star s spectral contribution  which is estimated by looking for the best subtraction of the line features",
    " tends to be correlated with the spectral type .",
    "we therefore implemented a monte carlo procedure , as follows .",
    "first , for each assumed secondary spectral type , we defined a permitted range of secondary - star @xmath17 magnitudes , based on our decompositions .",
    "we also assumed a normally - distributed 0.2 mag uncertainty in our spectrophotometric normalization . in this case",
    ", acceptable decompositions could be found for k2 through k6 ; we assigned discrete probabilities of 0.3 to k4 , 0.2 to k3 and k5 , and 0.15 to k2 and k6 .",
    "for the surface brightness at each spectral type , we used an analytical fit to surface brightness vs. spectral type data presented by @xcite , and assumed a @xmath66 mag range of uncertainty in this calibration . for the secondary star mass we took @xmath67 , based on the @xcite evolutionary calculation",
    "; we took masses to be uniformly distributed within this range and used the random masses to to compute the secondary s radius . the surface brightness and radius then gave the absolute magnitude , which combined with the secondary s @xmath17 gave an apparent distance modulus . for reddening , we used the @xcite maps to establish an upper limit of @xmath68 , and  since the star is within the dust layer and evidently not exceptionally distant  we took the reddening to be @xmath69 , with an upper cutoff at 0.18 and a lower cutoff at 0.02 . with all these ingredients in place",
    ", we computed 10,000 distances , drawing each ingredient from its assumed distribution every time .",
    "the resulting distances are shown in figure  [ fig : montecarlo ] ; the median and the ends of the 68% confidence error bars give a distance of 900 ( + 190,@xmath0150 ) pc .",
    "we searched for optical pulsations in this source using the andor camera on three consecutive nights in 2013 january .",

    "our best radial velocity period amounts to 17.23 cycle d@xmath16 , so the photometric modulation does not appear to be coherent on the radial - velocity period ; constraining the radial - velocity period to a range consistent with the apparent photometric period results in very poor fits .    the photometry from 2013 jun 13 ut also shows flickering with a timescale of 5 to 10 minutes and an amplitude of up to @xmath137 magnitudes .",

    "the large velocity amplitude , and extensive line wings , suggest that this is a polar , or am herculis star , in which much of the emission comes largely from a synchronously - rotating , magnetically - channelled accretion column .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : swift2218fig ] shows a greyscale phase - averaged spectrum synthesized from our spectra , prepared using the procedure discussed in section [ sec : swift0732 ] .",
    "the image reveals two distinct emission - line components : one of them is diffuse and has a large velocity amplitude , and the other is sharper , has a lower amplitude , and is visible over only part of the phase .",
    "the diffuse component very likely arises in an accretion column , and the sharp component is probably radiation reprocessed on the side of the secondary star that faces the white dwarf . the sharp component comes into view around its maximum positive velocity , and fades from view near its minimum velocity ; this is just as expected from a heated face .",
    "the behavior of the emission - line profiles with phase closely resembles that of known polars @xcite , so we conclude that  is another example of this type .    using the single - trail image ,",

    "the epoch @xmath140 falls 0.26 cycle later than the @xmath140 listed in table [ tab : parameters ] ; it corresponds to the blue - to - red transition of the sharp component , so it very likely represents the inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "the epoch in table [ tab : parameters ] is based on `` whole - line '' measurements , which do not have a simple physical interpretation but which do define the period well .",
    "if the masses of the component stars are broadly typical for cvs of this period , and the sharp component traces the motion of the secondary , then the orbital inclination @xmath141 is unremarkable . for illustration , taking @xmath142 m@xmath143 and @xmath144 m@xmath145 ( using @xcite as a guide ) , our @xmath146 implies @xmath147 , so eclipses are unlikely .",
    "the selection of cvs studied here does not comprise a well - defined `` sample '' in any quantitative sense . however , selected on the basis of hard x - ray detection and variability , they lead to the expected result that at least eight of the ten are magnetic cvs , of which seven are of the ip class , which is the dominant cv population in hard x - ray surveys .",
    "their spin and orbit periods are within the ranges previously observed for members of their classes .",
    "here we summarize the most interesting conclusions about the individual objects , and offer recommendations for further work on some of these stars .",

    "the previously debated nature of  is resolved in favor of an ip by showing that its 626  s x - ray ( spin ) period is also present in the optical , and by discovering its 5.7  hr orbital period .",
    "together , these are typical results for a cv , but the 626  s period is too long for a neutron star in a low - mass x - ray binary",
    ". the assumed wd nature of the compact object could be further tested with campaign of coherent timing of its rotation ; long - term constancy would be expected for a wd , but not for a neutron star .",
    "our study identified two new cvs ,  and .",
