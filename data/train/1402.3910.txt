    "the deuteron has long been recognized as an ideal laboratory for studying the dynamics of nucleon  nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interactions . in particular ,",
    "when the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath0 is of the order of the nucleon mass squared , @xmath5 , or when the fraction of momentum @xmath3 carried by the scattered quarks in the deuteron is in the vicinity of @xmath6 , the role of short - distance effects in the deuteron wave function becomes more prominent .",
    "this region makes it possible to explore the structure of the simplest nuclear bound state directly from the underlying theory of the strong interactions , qcd .",
    "together with the constraints on the long - range structure of the deuteron derived from chiral effective theory , the ultimate goal , of course , is to obtain a quantitative description of the deuteron s structure over all distance scales .    from a more practical perspective",
    ", experiments involving electron ( or other lepton ) scattering from the deuteron targets have provided the main source of information about the structure of the neutron .",
    "the absence of free neutron targets has meant that properties such as the neutron s elastic form factors or deep - inelastic structure functions are usually extracted from measurements involving deuterons , using empirical information about the corresponding proton observables and knowledge of the @xmath4 interaction in the deuteron .",
    "use of heavier nuclei necessarily increases the size of the bound state effects , exacerbating the uncertainties introduced through our incomplete knowledge of the nuclear wave function and the reaction mechanism .",
    "a robust extraction of neutron information requires a reliable baseline model which accounts for the standard nuclear physics in the deuteron .",
    "this is usually embodied in the nuclear impulse approximation , in which the probe scatters incoherently from individual nucleons in the deuteron @xcite .",
    "corrections to this framework arise in the form of rescattering or final state interactions between the struck nucleon and the spectator recoil @xcite , as well as meson exchange currents @xcite , nucleon off - shell corrections @xcite , and possible non - nucleonic components of the deuteron wave function .",
    "the unambiguous identification of these more exotic effects is only feasible when the baseline calculations within the impulse approximation can be performed with a sufficient degree of precision .",
    "a successful framework which has been used to describe inclusive inelastic electron scattering from nuclei is the weak binding approximation ( wba ) , developed by and applied to both unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite scattering from the deuteron , as well as @xmath7he @xcite and heavier nuclei @xcite .",
    "it was also utilized in the extraction of the free neutron structure function @xmath8 from inclusive deuterium and proton data in the nucleon resonance region @xcite , and the subsequent verification of quark - hadron duality in the neutron @xcite .",
    "of course , any general approach which aspires to have predictive power must be able to describe a wider set of observables than just a limited class of reactions .",
    "perhaps the most direct window on the nuclear structure of the deuteron is offered by the process of quasi - elastic ( qe ) scattering , where the electron scatters elastically from a proton or neutron bound in the deuteron .",
    "a large body of data has been accumulated on qe electron ",
    "deuteron scattering over the past few decades , covering a large range of @xmath0 ( between @xmath9 and 10  gev@xmath10 ) and energies @xmath11 ( between @xmath12 and 20  gev ) , at forward and backward scattering angles @xcite .    in the impulse approximation",
    "the qe cross section is proportional to the light - cone momentum distributions of nucleons in the deuteron , @xmath13 ( also referred to as the `` smearing functions '' ) .",
    "these are the same distributions that are used to compute the deuteron structure functions in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , where they are convoluted with the inelastic structure functions of the bound nucleons .",
    "the resulting convolutions depend rather sensitively on the precise structure of both the smearing functions and the nucleon structure functions . for qe scattering the deuteron structure functions",
    "are directly given by @xmath13 , multiplied by @xmath0-dependent elastic nucleon form factors .",
    "this makes qe scattering the ideal testing ground for models of the deuteron structure and the details of the nucleon momentum distributions .    despite the extensive work that has been carried out on computing the smearing functions for application to deep - inelastic scattering , using realistic deuteron wave functions and including finite-@xmath0 corrections ,",
    "surprisingly there has never been a direct test of the wba formalism with qe scattering data . in this paper",
    "we perform such an analysis , confronting the calculated light - cone momentum distributions with the entire set of available qe cross sections .",
    "the level of agreement between the data and theory will reveal the limits of validity of the wba in the impulse approximation , and the degree to which rescattering or more exotic effects need to be incorporated for a complete description of electron  deuteron scattering .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ia ] we review the formalism needed to describe electron  deuteron scattering in the qe region , and outline the derivation of the unpolarized deuteron @xmath14 and @xmath15 structure functions within the wba .",
    "we examine the possible effects of the modification of nucleon structure functions off the mass - shell , and estimate the uncertainty on this modification using two different prescriptions for the electromagnetic current commonly invoked in the literature .",
    "the calculated qe cross sections are compared in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] with all available data on inclusive electron ",
    "deuteron scattering in the qe region , for @xmath16 .",
    "we compare the predictions using the same smearing functions as those utilized in deep - inelastic scattering , including the kinematical , finite-@xmath0 corrections to the smearing functions derived in the high-@xmath0 limit .",
    "we further investigate the dependence of the cross sections on the deuteron wave function , for several models based on high - precision @xmath4 potentials , as well as on the effects of the nucleon off - shell corrections . a comprehensive comparison with the data such as this",
    "will allow us to clearly delineate the regions where the impulse approximation is adequate for understanding the essential features of the data , and identify where additional effects may be needed in future analyses ( @xmath2 ) . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] we summarize our findings and discuss their implications for future work .",
    "in this section we summarize the main results for inclusive electron  deuteron scattering in the impulse approximation . after reviewing the general results for the deuteron structure functions within the framework of the wba , we describe how the results are applied to the case of elastic scattering from the nucleon bound inside the deuteron .",
    "we present results for the case where the bound nucleon structure is assumed to be the same as that for a free nucleon , as well as for the more general case where the off - shell structure of the bound nucleon is explicitly taken into account .",
