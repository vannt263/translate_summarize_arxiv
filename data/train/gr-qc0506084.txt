    "the anniversary of a great idea is usually a good occasion for critical reassessment of its meaning , influence , and future . in theoretical physics ,",
    "where methodology , instead of hermeneutics , is based on popperian conjectures and refutations scheme this last issue  the future  is , of course , the most important .",
    "thus , in the course of the celebrations of the 100 anniversary of the theory of relativity , we are mostly interested in asking the questions : is special relativity still to be regarded as the correct theory describing relativistic phenomena ( particles and fields kinematics and dynamics ) in flat space - time ?",
    "will it survive the next 100 years , and if not , which theory is going to replace it ?",
    "one quite often hears the opinion that there is , in fact , no such theory as special relativity .",
    "what we have to do with is just a very particular , flat space - time limit of general relativity . and",
    "given the fact that few of us doubt that the ultimate theory of gravity should be quantum gravity ( in the form of loop quantum gravity , or string theory , or perhaps  and most likely  in the disguise we do not really know yet ) the question to be posed is : what is the flat space , semiclassical limit of quantum gravity ?    for a long time it was taken as obvious that such a limit should be just the ordinary special relativity .",
    "recent developments , however , put some doubts on this naive conclusion .",
    "first , assuming that one or another form of ( super)strings theory is indeed the correct theory of quantum gravity one may contemplate the idea that in the ( super)string vacuum , corresponding to our universe , lorentz invariance is spontaneously broken .",
    "this would certainly lead to some , possibly observable , modifications of special relativity @xcite .",
    "violation of lorentz symmetry is also possible in models based on loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "the issue of lorentz invariance violation and its possible observational consequences has been recently reviewed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the core of all the proposals of spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking is introduction of some sort of aether . while phenomenological models of this form are certainly interesting , making possible to device precise experimental tests , they are much less appealing theoretically , since they are based on rejection of the most cherished principle of physics , the relativity principle . in our view",
    "there is no a priori reason , neither theoretical , nor experimental , to contemplate violation of relativity principle .",
    "this does not mean that modifications of special relativity are not possible , and we will argue below that there are good reasons to believe that if one regards special relativity ( understood as a kinematical theory of particles and fields on flat semiclassical space - time ) as a limit of ( quantum ) gravity , it is inevitable that some , planck scale corrections , must be present . in a sense ,",
    "the presence of this scale reflects the `` memory '' of flat space - time about its ( quantum ) gravitational origin .",
    "let us start with the plausible assumption that the flat space - time kinematics of point particles originates in some theory of quantum gravity .",
    "assume further that in taking the flat space - time , semiclassical limit there is no breaking of spacetime symmetries , and in particular that the relativity principle holds ( in other words , the diffeomorphism invariance of the theory is not being broken in the process . )",
    "after taking this limit the space - time will be , at least locally , the standard minkowski space - time , however it may well be that the resulting theory still possesses some information about its origin , in the form of the observer independent mass scale , @xmath0 , of order of planck scale",
    ". this scale will be still present as a parameter in the transformation laws , relating different inertial observers .",
    "if such a scale indeed is present , it is natural to expect that deviations from the standard special relativistic kinematics arise in the processes characterized by the energy scale close to @xmath0 , and that these deviations should be rather generic @xcite .",
    "for example , it may happen that the standard dispersion relation for particles acquires additional terms , to wit @xmath1 with @xmath2 being a dimensionless parameter of order 1 .",
    "naively , modified dispersion relation would immediately imply the existence of preferred frame , since if it holds in one frame it does not hold in any other , related to the original one by the standard lorentz transformation .",
    "however we can demand that along with deforming dispersion relation we deform lorentz transformations , so that ( [ 1 ] ) ( and their generalizations to be introduced shortly ) remain invariant under action of six parameter group of transformations , with generators satisfying lorentz @xmath3 algebra .",
    "based on this intuition , giovanni amelino - camelia @xcite , @xcite formulated a set of postulates that should be satisfied by new theory , replacing special relativity , in the regime of ultra - high energies , and he dubbed this theory doubly special relativity .",
    "doubly special relativity is based on the following postulates :    1 .   _",
    "the relativity principle holds_. this means that if two observers describe the same phenomenon , possible differences in their descriptions can only depend on their relative motion ( in the case of inertial observers  their relative velocity ) .",
    "in particular there is no notion of absolute rest , and absolute motion .",
    "it follows also that if some process is observed by one observers ( for example particle ( 1 ) collides with particle ( 2 ) producing particle ( 3 ) ) , all observers agree that this process takes place .",
    "_ there exist two observer - independent scales _ : the velocity scale c , identified with velocity of light , and , the mass scale @xmath0 , identified with planck mass ( @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "it is worth recalling at this point what is the difference between observer independent scales and other dimensionful quantities one encounters in physical theories . to be more specific ,",
    "let us consider the question what is the difference , in the framework of the standard special relativity , between a coupling constant , like electric charge @xmath5 or planck s constant @xmath6 , and the velocity of light @xmath7 .",
    "in the first case , of dimensionful coupling constants , all observers measure their values with the help of identical , low energy experiments , performed in their rest frame",
    ". then the relativity principle guarantees that all the observers will obtain the same numerical values of the constants .",
    "these values can be then used in other experiments . in the case of the speed of light",
    "the situation is different however .",
    "since this speed is an observer independent scale , we demand also that if two inertial observers measure velocity of _ the same _ photon , they will obtain the same result .",
    "this is clearly incompatible with galilean relativity , but , as we know , has been successfully built into the principles of his special relativity .",
    "analogously , in the construction of doubly special relativity we postulate the presence of yet another observer - independent scale , this time of dimension of mass , whose numerical value is presumed to be of order of planck mass . ] .",
    "it has soon been realized @xcite , @xcite ( for recent review see @xcite ) that these postulates are satisfied in the framework of theories in which poincar algebra is replaced by deformed @xmath0-poincar algebra @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite - poincar algebra  not only in the sense analogous to the well known fact special relativity is not just the poincar algebra  there might be dsr proposals in which this algebra does not play any role . ] .",
    "one possible realization is provided by the , so - called , bicrossproduct ( or majid  ruegg)basis @xcite , in which the commutators between rotation @xmath8 , boost @xmath9 , and momentum @xmath10 generators are the following    @xmath11 =   \\epsilon_{ijk } m_k , \\quad [ m_i , n_j ] =   \\epsilon_{ijk } n_k,\\ ] ] @xmath12 = - \\epsilon_{ijk } m_k.\\ ] ]    and    @xmath13 =   \\epsilon_{ijk } p_k ,",
    "\\quad [ m_i , p_0 ] = 0\\ ] ] @xmath14 =    \\delta_{ij }   \\left ( { 1\\over 2 } \\left (   1 -e^{-2{p_0}/\\kappa } \\right ) + { { \\mathbf{p}^2}\\over 2\\kappa }   \\right ) -   \\frac1\\kappa\\ , p_{i}p_{j},\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath15 =   p_{i}.\\nonumber\\ ] ]    as one can easily check , the casimir of the @xmath0-poincar algebra ( [ 2 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) reads @xmath16 it is easy to check also that the expansion of ( [ 4 ] ) to the leading order in @xmath17 yields ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "one should note at this point that the bicrossproduct algebra above is not the only possible realization of dsr .",
    "for example , in @xcite , @xcite magueijo and smolin proposed and carefully analyzed another dsr proposal , called sometimes dsr2 . in dsr2 the lorentz algebra is still not deformed and there are no deformations in the brackets of rotations and momenta .",
    "the boosts momenta generators have now the form @xmath18 =   i\\left ( \\delta_{ij}p_0 -    { 1\\over \\kappa } p_{i}p_{j } \\right),\\ ] ] and @xmath19 = i\\ , \\left ( 1 - { p_0\\over \\kappa}\\right)\\,p_{i}.\\ ] ] it is easy to check that the casimir for this algebra has the form @xmath20    in order to describe kinematics of a particle we must extend the above algebra to the algebra of phase space of the particle .",
    "we will not derive here all the results , and the reader could find the derivation with references to the original literature in the review paper @xcite .",
    "instead we will just state the main results which will be important below , when we compare dsr with a theory resulting as a flat limit of gravity coupled to point particles .",
    "* both the bicrossproduct ( [ 2])([4 ] ) and magueijo  smolin algebras ( [ ms1])([ms3 ] ) can be understood as examples of larger class of algebras constructed as follows . in the standard special relativity four - momentum",
    "can be thought of as a point of four dimensional flat manifold of lorentz signature  the flat momentum manifold .",
    "notice that in this case positions , being `` translations of momenta '' are points of another flat minkowski space . in transition to dsr",
    ", assume instead that the space of momenta is a maximally symmetric manifold of ( constant ) curvature , @xmath21 . in the limit when @xmath0 goes to infinity",
    ", the curvature goes to zero and we return to special relativity , as we should .",
    "in given coordinates on this constant curvature momentum space , each point will correspond to some four - momentum .",
    "as it is well known , the group of symmetries in this case is the 10-parameter ( in 4 dimensions ) de sitter group @xmath22 .",
    "this group possesses a six - parameter subgroup , @xmath23 , isomorphic with lorentz group , and one can easily compute what will be infinitesimal action of the group elements on points of the manifold .",
    "it turns out that , for example , the bicrossproduct basis corresponds to the standard system of coordinates , used in cosmology .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite and @xcite . * what about the remaining four parameters of de sitter group @xmath22 ?",
    "it is well known from differential geometry , that while the generators of @xmath23 act as `` rotations '' the remaining ones play the role of `` translations '' .",
    "this means that it is natural to identify them with positions .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to arrange the remaining four generators @xmath24 so as to form the iwasawa decomposition of the @xmath25 algebra ; explicitly their commutators could be brought to the following form @xmath26=0 , \\quad \\left[x^0,x^i\\right]={1\\over\\kappa } x^i\\ ] ] the noncommutative space - time satisfying ( [ 5 ] ) is called @xmath0-minkowski space - time . * it should be noted that there is a natural hopf algebra structure associated with an algebra of symmetries of de sitter space .",
    "this algebra turns out to be exactly the quantum @xmath0-poincar algebra of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "* it should be also noted that one can in principle construct analogous structure starting from the momentum space of the particle being anti - de sitter space @xcite .",
    "explicit models in four dimensions are not known in this case , however they play a role in 2 + 1 gravity coupled to a particle , as we will discuss in details below .    given characterization of properties of single particle dsr models let us now turn to the question , what is dsr coming from .",
    "it is usually considered rather obvious that special relativity , regarded as a theory of particle kinematics should emerge somehow from general relativity coupled to point particles in a limit , in which gravitational interactions are `` switched off '' .",
    "it turns out that it is surprisingly difficult to prove this claim in the framework of the standard einstein formulation of gr .",
    "first of all `` switching off '' gravity would presumably mean going to zero with gravitational constant , but this limit is known to be pathological in gr .",
    "moreover it is well known that coupling of gr to point particle is at least problematic , if not impossible .",
    "our starting point must be therefore some another ( but equivalent ) form of the gravity action .",
    "the convenient form has been derived recently by freidel and starodubtsev @xcite .",
    "the starting point of that paper is the observation theory of gravity can be defined by the action containing two parts : the `` vacuum '' one , being a topological field theory with an appropriate gauge group , and the constraints , leading to the emergence of the dynamical degrees of freedom of gravity .",
    "both parts are manifestly diffeomorphism invariant , which opens new perspectives in construction of diffeomorphism - invariant perturbation theory for quantum gravity . from our perspective , however , the most important aspect of this theory would be that it makes it possible both to define a limit , in which local degrees of freedom of gravity are switched off and the point particle coupling .",
    "one can say that in this formulation theory of gravity has the well defined `` dsr limit . ''",
    "the construction of the freidel ",
    "starodubtsev theory borrows from earlier works @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and is based on the @xmath22 gauge theory .",
    "the basic dynamical variables are @xmath25 connection one form @xmath27 , and the @xmath25-valued two - form @xmath28 .",
    "the starting point is the action principle @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the curvature of connection @xmath27 .",
    "the equations of motion following from this action @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the covariant derivative of connection @xmath33 , tell that the connection is flat , while the @xmath28 field is covariantly constant .",
    "the solutions of these equations on locally connected region @xmath34 is of the form @xmath35    the theory is therefore almost trivial , without any local degrees of freedom .    in order to get general relativity we must break local symmetry of the theory from @xmath22 down to the lorentz group @xmath23 . to this end",
    "we denote by 5 the preferred direction in the algebra space , and add to the action the term which explicitly breaks the @xmath22 gauge symmetry , to wit    @xmath36    let us now decompose the algebra index @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 being an invariant @xmath23 tensor . note that now the first equation in ( [ bf2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath40 and",
    "is manifestly _ not _",
    "@xmath22 covariant .",
    "the @xmath41-field enters the action",
    "@xmath42 only algebraically , so we can substitute the solution ( [ bf2a ] ) back to the action ( [ bf3 ] ) to get @xmath43    it is convenient at this point to decompose the curvature as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the 4-dimensional connection one - form and @xmath46 is a frame field which corresponding to the metric @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is the @xmath49 curvature of connection @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "notice that for dimensional reasons we had to introduce the scale @xmath52 , of dimension of length . using the equations for the curvature ( [ bf4 ] ) , we can rewrite the action in terms of @xmath49 curvature : @xmath53 what we get is nothing but the palatini action of general relativity with cosmological constant plus additional term whose variation vanishes identically due to bianchi identity . note that the newton s constant @xmath54 equals @xmath55 , while the cosmological constant @xmath56 .",
    "thus the coupling constant @xmath57 is dimensionless and extremely small , which makes it a perfect candidate for a parameter of ( both classical and quantum ) perturbative expansion .",
    "as stressed by freidel and starodubtsev @xcite , the constrained bf theory is therefore very promising as a starting point for construction of perturbative quantum gravity , where diffeomorphism invariance is manifestly preserved at all steps of perturbative expansion .    to the initial , topological action ( [ bf1 ] )",
    "we can still add the @xmath22 cosmological term of the form @xmath58 this addition changes the equations of motion : @xmath59 ( the second equation follows in fact from the first and bianchi identity . )    it can be shown that the action ( [ bf7 ] ) is still topological , i.e. , without local degrees of freedom .",
    "as before we can add to this action the @xmath2 constraint , in order to obtain the action of general relativity with the additional term @xmath60 and more more topological terms .",
    "the `` bare action '' parameters @xmath61 are related to the physical ones @xmath54 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 ( immirzi parameter ) as follows @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ( for more details and discussion of possible physical relevance of @xmath63 parameter see @xcite , and also recent paper @xcite . )",
    "the convenient basis of @xmath25 algebra is provided by dirac matrices @xmath67 $ ] and @xmath68 . using the @xmath25 algebra valued fields @xmath69",
    ", @xmath70 the constrained bf action for gravity can be rewritten in the following form @xmath71    it is quite easy to couple point particles to the constrained bf action . indeed",
    "since @xmath27 is a one form , it couples naturally to one - dimensional objects  the particles world - lines .",
    "the general procedure of coupling particles carrying non - abelian charges to yang - mills potential has been developed by balachandran , marmo , skagerstam , and stern ( see @xcite and references therein . ) in the case at hands the gauge group is @xmath22 .",
    "this group acts by conjugation on its algebra , and the orbits can be labelled by two numbers , corresponding to values of two casimirs , representing mass and spin of the particle , as follows @xmath72 as the second ingredient we take connection , gauge - transformed by an arbitrary element @xmath73 of the lorentz subgroup @xmath23 of @xmath22 @xmath74 where , as before @xmath25 connection @xmath75 decomposes into @xmath49 connection @xmath76 and tetrad @xmath5 @xmath77    then the action of the particle with mass @xmath78 and spin @xmath79 coupled to constrained bf gravity is defined to be @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the value of gauge transformed connection ( [ bf10 ] ) on the particle world - line .",
    "we see therefore that the dynamics of the particle is described with the help of the charge @xmath82 it carries , and the lorentz transformation @xmath73 relating the particle rest frame and the frame of ( asymptotic ) observer . it can be shown that variation of the action ( [ bf12 ] ) leads to the correct mathiasson - papapetrou equations describing the dynamic of spinning particle in the presence of torsion .",
    "when the torsion is zero we recover the usual mathiasson - papapetrou equation , which in the case of vanishing spin reduces to the usual geodesic equation .",
    "having defined the coupling of the particle to gravitational field we can address the question as to what would be the effective behavior of the particle in the limiting case , when the local degrees of freedom of gravitational field are being switched off . to answer this question , one should proceed as follows : take the action being the sum of ( [ bf8 ] ) and ( [ bf12 ] ) , solve the resulting equations of motion , and then take the limit @xmath83 . to see which outcomes of this procedure are possible ,",
    "note that that although in this limit the gravitational field will become flat in the bulk space - time , there might be some nontrivial leftover at the worldline of the particle .",
    "this contribution of the gravitational field may lead to deformation of the ( otherwise free ) particle action ( [ bf12 ] ) , leading to dsr like behavior .",
    "unfortunately , due to the technical difficulties , the programme described above has not been realized in practice yet .",
    "what can be done , however , is to turn to a simpler model of gravity coupled to a particle , in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "as we will see in the next section the structure of this model is very similar to the four - dimensional case with the parameters @xmath84 equal zero , i.e. , in the limit we are mostly interested in .",
    "moreover , the three - dimensional case is not purely of academic interest , as the following argument , borrowed from @xcite and @xcite , clearly shows .",
    "the main idea is to construct an experimental situation that forces a dimensional reduction from the four dimensional to the @xmath85 dimensional theory .",
    "it is interesting that this can be done in quantum theory , using the uncertainty principle as an essential element of the argument .",
    "let us consider free elementary particles in @xmath86 dimensions , whose mass are less than @xmath87 .",
    "the motion of the particles will be linear , at least in some classes of coordinates systems , not accelerating with respect to the natural inertial coordinates at infinity .",
    "let us consider the particle as described by an inertial observer who travels perpendicular to the plane of its motion , which we will call the @xmath88 direction .",
    "from the point of view of that observer , the particles are in an eigenstate of longitudinal momentum , @xmath89 , with some eigenvalue @xmath90 .",
    "since the particles are in an eigenstate of @xmath89 their wavefunction will be uniform in @xmath88 , with wavelength @xmath91 where ( note that we assume here that @xmath91 is so large that we can trust the standard uncertainty relation ; besides this uncertainty relation is not being modified in some formulations of dsr ) @xmath92    at the same time , we assume that the uncertainties in the transverse positions are bounded a scale @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 .",
    "then the wavefunction for the the particles has support on a narrow cylinder of radius @xmath93 which extend uniformly in the @xmath88 direction .",
    "finally , we assume that the state of the gravitational field is semiclassical , so that to a good approximation , within @xmath95 the semiclassical einstein equations hold .",
    "since the wavefunction is uniform in @xmath88 , this implies that the gravitational field seen by our observer will have a spacelike killing field @xmath96 .",
    "thus , if there are no forces other than the gravitational field , the semiclassical particles must be described by an equivalent @xmath85 dimensional problem in which the gravitational field is dimensionally reduced along the @xmath88 direction so that the particles , which are the source of the gravitational field , are replaced by punctures .",
    "the dimensional reduction is governed by a length @xmath97 , which is the extent in @xmath88 that the system extends .",
    "we can not take @xmath98 without violating the uncertainty principle .",
    "it is then convenient to take @xmath99 .",
    "further , since the system consists of the particles , with no intrinsic extent , there is no other scale associated with their extent in the @xmath88 direction .",
    "we can then identify @xmath100 and @xmath101 to make an equivalent toroidal system , and then dimensionally reduce along @xmath88 .",
    "the relationship between the four dimensional newton s constant @xmath102 and the three dimensional newton s constant @xmath103 is given by @xmath104    thus , in the analogous @xmath105 dimensional system , which is equivalent to the original system as seen from the point of view of the boosted observer , the newton s constant depends on the longitudinal momentum .",
    "of course , in general there will be an additional scalar field , corresponding to the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field .",
    "however , since we are interested only in the four - dimensional limit , in which local degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are not present , all these fields will vanish this limit .",
    "now we note that , if there are no other particles or excited degrees of freedom , the energy of the system can to a good approximation be described by the hamiltonian @xmath106 of the two dimensional dimensionally reduced system .",
    "this is described by a boundary integral , which may be taken over any circle that encloses the particle .",
    "but it is well known that in @xmath107 gravity @xmath106 is bounded from above .",
    "this may seem strange , but it is easy to see that it has a natural four dimensional interpretation .",
    "the bound is given by @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the value of the adm hamiltonian , @xmath106 .",
    "but this just implies that @xmath110 i.e. this has to be true , otherwise the dynamics of the gravitational field in @xmath86 dimensions would have collapsed the system to a black hole !",
    "thus , we see that the total bound from above of the energy in @xmath85 dimensions is necessary so that one can not violate the condition in @xmath86 dimensions that a system be larger than its schwarzschild radius .",
    "note that we also must have @xmath111 together with ( [ sch ] ) this implies @xmath112 , which is of course necessary if the semiclassical argument we are giving is to hold .",
    "now , we have put no restriction on any components of momentum or position in the transverse directions .",
    "so the system still has symmetries in the transverse directions .",
    "furthermore , the argument extends to any number of particles , so long as their relative momenta are coplanar .",
    "thus , we learn the following .",
    "let @xmath113 be the full hilbert space of the quantum theory of gravity , coupled to some appropriate matter fields , with @xmath114 .",
    "let us consider a subspace of states @xmath115 which are relevant in the low energy limit in which all energies are small in planck units .",
    "we expect that this will have a symmetry algebra which is related to the poincar algebra @xmath116 in @xmath117 dimensions , by some possible small deformations parameterized by @xmath102 and @xmath6 .",
    "let us call this low energy symmetry group @xmath118 .",
    "let us now consider the subspace of @xmath119 which is described by the system we have just constructed .",
    "it contains the particle , and is an eigenstate of @xmath120 with large @xmath121 and vanishing longitudinal momentum .",
    "let us call this subspace of hilbert space @xmath122 .",
    "the conditions that define this subspace break the generators of the ( possibly modified ) poincar algebra that involve the @xmath88 direction .",
    "but they leave unbroken the symmetry in the @xmath85 dimensional transverse space . thus , a subgroup of @xmath123 acts on this space , which we will call @xmath124 .",
    "we have argued that the physics in @xmath122 is to good approximation described by an analogue system of a particle in @xmath85 gravity .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section the symmetry algebra acting there is not the ordinary @xmath105 dimensional poincar algebra , but the @xmath0-poincar algebra in @xmath105 dimensions , with @xmath125    now we can note the following .",
    "whatever @xmath118 is , it must have the following properties :    * it depends on @xmath102 and @xmath6 , so that it s action on _ each _ subspace @xmath122 , for each choice of @xmath126 , is the @xmath0 deformed @xmath107 poincar algebra , with @xmath0 as above .",
    "* it does not satisfy the rule that momenta and energy add , on all states in @xmath127 , since they are not satisfied in these subspaces . * therefore , whatever @xmath128 is , it is not the classical poincar group .    let us therefore turn to gravity coupled with point particle in 2 + 1 dimension .",
    "even if not for the argument given in the preceding section , the 2 + 1 dimensional gravity coupled with point particles would be a perfect test ground for investigating properties of dsr theories . as it is well known this theory is topological , i.e. , does not posses any local degrees of freedom , moreover its action @xmath129 resembles very closely the four dimensional action of the constrained bf theory in the dsr limit @xmath130    investigations in 2 + 1-dimensional gravity have been pioneered by staruszkiewicz in 1963 @xcite , with interest revived by seminal papers by deser , jackiw and  t hooft @xcite and witten @xcite . here",
    "we will follow the approach proposed by matschull and welling in @xcite .",
    "the action for ( 2 + 1 ) gravity reads : @xmath131 and the basic fields are dreibein @xmath132 and antisymmetric spin connection @xmath133 , whereas @xmath54 is the gravitational constant , which in ( 2 + 1 ) gravity has a dimension of inverse mass .",
    "the lorentz group in 2 + 1 dimension @xmath134 is isomorphic to @xmath135 ( which we will in the following denote just @xmath136 ) and thus the field strength @xmath137 defined as : @xmath138\\ ] ] is lie algebra @xmath139-valued .",

    "the opening angle of the cone is related to the particle mass and equals @xmath149 . in the case of a spinning particle",
    "the space - time geometry is called a spinning cone characterized by deficit angle , related to the mass and time offset related to the spin , see @xcite.,height=151 ]    in polar coordinates ( @xmath150 , @xmath93 , @xmath151 ) , the solution of einstein equations corresponding to a single spinning particle is of the form @xmath152    this solution corresponds to particle described , similarly to ( [ bf12 ] ) as a delta - like singularity with an appropriate poincar charge .",
    "there is , however another , more convenient way of treating particles proposed by matschull and welling @xcite , illustrated in figure 2 . as a result",
    "we get singularity free , simply connected spacetime , with boundaries . to make cylindrical boundary look like one dimensional worldline of the particle",
    ", we take additional assumption that it circumference vanishes , which can be expressed as requirement that the component @xmath153 vanishes on the boundary @xmath154 where bar marks the value of the field on the boundary .",
    "since our manifold is simply connected now , a general solutions of einstein equations in the neighborhood of the boundary is provided by two functions @xmath155 satisfying ( [ 3d4 ] ) . on this solution",
    "we must impose appropriate boundary conditions , one of which would be ( [ 3d7 ] ) at @xmath156 , and another that guarantees continuity of dreibein and connection along the cut @xmath157 , @xmath158 . for convenience let us denote @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "since @xmath133 and @xmath161 are to be continuous at the boundary , @xmath162 and @xmath163 are not independent , and are related by global poincar transformation of the form @xmath164 where @xmath165 and @xmath166 are constant .    .",
    "the resulting , simply connected manifold with boundaries is shown in the figure . on this surface",
    "we introduce polar coordinates : @xmath167 , where the line @xmath156 corresponds to the horizontal boundary , and @xmath168 , where the lines @xmath169 and @xmath170 correspond to the left and right vertical boundaries . to make the surface @xmath156 looking as a worldline of a particle",
    ", we further assume that @xmath171.,height=151 ]    now the condition ( [ 3d7 ] ) along with ( [ 3d4 ] ) @xmath172 tells that @xmath173 .",
    "this and the fact that boundary represents worldline the particle makes it possible to identify @xmath174 with the location of the particle in space - time @xmath175 moreover , using the condition @xmath176 and poincar transformation , we find that @xmath177 taking time derivative of this equation and making use of the fact that @xmath178 and @xmath179 are constants gives @xmath180 this last equation is satisfied if and only if the group element @xmath181 is of the form @xmath182 it is natural then to identify @xmath183 with components of momentum of the particle . note however that this momentum has an unusual property , namely it is , geometrically , a point of the three dimensional anti de sitter space . indeed , since @xmath184 , @xmath185 and thus it follows from ( [ 3d13 ] ) that @xmath186 which is just a definition of anti de sitter space .",
    "we see therefore that three dimensional gravity coupled to point particle possesses a fundamental dsr characteristics : the energy - momentum manifold is curved .",
    "it can be shown that instead of the standard dispersion relation the particle on shell satisfies the deformed equation @xmath187 of course , in the limit when @xmath188 ( remember that the mass scale is set equal 1 ) we recover the standard dispersion relation .    we know from ( [ 3d4 ] ) that the gravitational field in the bulk is pure gauge .",
    "it follows that when particles are present the only dynamical degrees of freedom may be associated with boundaries .",
    "therefore , if we start with the action for gravity on the manifold with boundaries , like that in figure 2 , and then perform symplectic reduction , as the result we find action defined only on the worldline on the particle . as we will see in the moment this action differs from the free particle one : the presence of gravitational field causes deformation of the particle lagrangian , exactly in the dsr spirit .",
    "the procedure described briefly above has been performed by matschull and welling @xcite and the resulting action reads @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the lagrange multiplier enforcing the mass shell constraint ( [ 3d15 ] ) . using the expression ( [ 3d13 ] ) and the fact that @xmath191 we can rewrite the lagrangian in the component form as follows @xmath192 it can be shown that , in spite of the complex , nonlinear form of the lagrangian , the resulting equations of motion are just the standard one , to wit @xmath193 let us now turn to discussion of the symmetries of the particle action @xmath194 it is clear from the form of the langrangian ( [ 3d17 ] ) that the action is invariant under standard action of lorentz generators , so that the lorentz transformations of both position and momentum are the same as in special relativity .    to find generators of lorentz transformations",
    ", we should first derive the form of poisson brackets , resulting from the symplectic potential in ( [ 3d17 ] ) .",
    "these brackets read @xmath195 @xmath196 and @xmath197 note that this last bracket tells that the positions of the particle do not commute .",
    "the exact form of this bracket differs from @xmath0-minkowski type of non - commutativity ( [ 5 ] ) , but is very closely related to it @xcite .    using these bracket it is not difficult to derive the form of noether charges @xmath198 , generating lorentz transformations through poisson bracket .",
    "these charges have the form @xmath199}\\ , p^b\\ ] ] and together with conserved momenta they form the standard poincar algebra .",
    "note however that while the action of lorentz generators @xmath198 on space - time variables @xmath200 is purely classical , the action of translations , generated by momenta @xmath183 is deformed , as a result of the bracket ( [ 3d21 ] ) .",
    "this means that in spite of the fact that the particle lives just in minkowski space - time the translational invariance is lost ( or being deformed ) .",
    "this reminds somehow the model considered by wess @xcite , in which also the isometry group is not deformed by itself , but by its action on space - time ( or , more generally  phase space ) variables .",
    "the form of the particle lagrangian ( [ 3d16 ] ) suggest simple generalization to the case when the energy momentum space is more general than the @xmath136 manifold considered by matschull and welling .",
    "consider , for example , the case when this space has the form of de sitter space .",
    "it follows from iwasawa decomposition of @xmath201 group ( where @xmath97 is dimension of space - time and momentum space ) that in this case the relevant group element has the form @xcite , @xcite @xmath202 where the generators of the `` translational '' part of lie algebra @xmath203 @xmath204 satisfy the commutational relations reminding the ones of @xmath0-minkowski space - time @xmath205 = - t_i , \\quad [ t_i , t_j ] = 0\\ ] ] the kinetic term of the lagrangian reads in this case @xmath206 and is invariant under action of the lorentz group of the form of ( [ 3 ] ) , appended by an appropriate action on position variables ( see @xcite , @xcite for details . ) in order to get the complete lagrangian , one should add to ( [ 3d26 ] ) the term @xmath207 , where @xmath208 is the casimir ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "it can be then checked that @xmath0-minkowski type of non - commutativity ( [ 5 ] ) follows from the lagrangian ( [ 3d26 ] ) .",
    "it is not clear , however , if this lagrangian can be obtained from gravity directly .",
    "work on this question is in progress .",
    "`` seventy - five thousand generations ago , our ancestors set this program in motion , '' the second man said , `` and in all that time we will be the first to hear the computer speak . ''",
    "`` we are the ones who will hear , '' said phouchg , `` the answer to the great question of life ! .. ''    `` the universe ! .. '' said loonquawl .    `` and everything ! .. ''    `` alright , '' said deep thought .",
    "`` the answer to the great question ... ''    `` yes ! .. ''    `` of life , the universe and everything ... '' said deep thought .    `` yes ! .. ''    `` is ... '' said deep thought , and paused .    `` yes ! .. ''    `` is ... ''    `` yes ! ! ! ? .. ''    `` forty - two , '' said deep thought , with infinite majesty and calm .",
    "the current status of dsr reminds somehow the adams `` forty - two '' , the answer to the question , which we do not really know . to be honest",
    ", we do not have any proof yet that this answer is correct , though we hope that pierre auger observatory and glast satellite will provide us with such a proof .",
    "however , as we tried to argue above , there are more and more indications that the right question is `` what is the semiclassical , flat space limit of quantum gravity ? ''",
    "it is our hope that it would not require seventy - five thousand generations to convince ourselves that this hypothesis is correct .",
