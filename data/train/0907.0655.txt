    "in the past few years the study of non - equilibrium magneto - transport in high mobility two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) has received much attention due to the experimental finding of intense oscillations of the magneto - resistivity and zero resistance states ( zrs ) .",
    "microwave - induced resistance oscillations ( miro ) were discovered @xcite in 2des samples subjected to microwave irradiation and moderate magnetic fields . for the miro",
    "the photoresistance is a function of the ratio @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are microwave and cyclotron frequencies .",
    "this outstanding discovery triggered a great amount of theoretical work @xcite .",
    "our current understanding of this phenomenon rests upon models that predict the existence of negative - resistance states ( nrs ) yielding an instability that rapidly drive the system into a zrs @xcite .",
    "two distinct mechanisms for the generation of nrs are known , one is based in the microwave - induced impurity scattering @xcite , while the second is linked to inelastic processes leading to a non - trivial distribution function @xcite .    an analogous effect , hall field - induced resistance oscillations ( hiro ) has been observed in high mobility samples in response to a dc - current excitation @xcite .",
    "although miro and hiro are basically different phenomena both rely on the commensurability of the cyclotron frequency with a characteristic parameter ; in both cases oscillations are periodic in @xmath4 . in hiro",
    "the oscillation peaks , observed in differential resistance , appear at integer values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 . here , @xmath6 is the energy associated with the hall voltage drop across the cyclotron diameter ; @xmath7 is the hall field and @xmath8 the cyclotron radius of the electron at the fermi level .",
    "it has been found that there are two main contributions to the hiro : the _ inelastic _ one is related to the formation of a non - equilibrium distribution function component that oscillates as a function of the energy@xcite and the _ elastic _ contribution is related to electron transitions between different lls due to impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "the first one was shown to be dominant at relatively weak electric fields , and the latter prevails in the strong - field regime .",
    "more recently it has been demonstrated that the effects of a direct dc current on electron transport can be quite dramatic leading to zero differential resistance states ( zdrs)@xcite . as compared with the hiro conditions , the zdrs are observed under dc bias at higher magnetic fields ( @xmath9 ) and lower mobilities ( @xmath10 ) . at low temperature and above a threshold bias",
    "current the differential resistivity vanishes and the longitudinal dc voltage becomes constant .",
    "positive values for the differential resistance are recovered at higher bias as the longitudinal dc voltage slope becomes positive .",
    "bykov et al .",
    "analyzed the results following an approach similar to that of andreev et al .",
    "@xcite ; the presence of the zdrs is attributed to the formation of negative differential resistance states ( ndrs ) that yields an instability that drives the system into a zdrs .",
    "similar results where obtained by chen et al .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we present a model to explain the formation of ndrs . according to our formalism both the effects of elastic impurity scattering as well as those related to inelastic processes play an important role .",
    "the model is based on the solution of the von neumann equation for 2d damped electrons , subjected to arbitrarily strong magnetic and dc electric fields , in addition to the weak effects of randomly distributed impurities .",
    "this procedures yields a kubo formula that includes the non - linear response with respect to the dc electric field . considering a current controlled scheme , we obtain a set of nonlinear self - consistent relations that allow us to determine the longitudinal and hall electric fields in terms of the imposed external current .",
    "it is shown that in order to correctly reproduce the main experimental results the inelastic scattering rate must obey a @xmath0 temperature dependence , consistent with electron - electron coulomb interaction as the dominant inelastic process .",

    "the factor @xmath30 takes care of the adiabatic switching of the impurity potential at the initial time @xmath31 .",
    "the motion of a planar electron in magnetic and electric fields can be decomposed into the guiding center coordinates @xmath32 and the relative coordinates @xmath33 , such that the position of the electron is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the guiding center coordinates is written as @xmath35 , in the symmetric gauge @xmath36 .",
    "the commutation relations for velocity and guiding center operators are @xmath37=\\left[{\\cal q}_x,{\\cal q}_y\\right]=-i\\hbar eb$ ] , with all the other commutators being zero .",
    "our aim now is to compute the electric current density . in order to calculate the expectation value of the current density",
    "we need the time - dependent matrix @xmath38 which obeys the von neumman s equation @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we assume that in the absence of the impurity potential the density matrix reduces to the equilibrium density matrix given by @xmath40 , with @xmath41 given by the fermi distribution function . in order to solve the von neumman s equation",
    "we apply three unitary transformations : the first two transformations exactly take into account the effects of the electric and magnetic fields , whereas the third transformation incorporates the impurity scattering effects to second order in time dependent perturbation theory .",
    "first we consider the unitary transformation @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are solutions of the dynamical equations @xmath47 except for the damping terms , these equations follow from the variation of the classical lagrangian @xmath48@xcite .",
    "the variables @xmath49 and @xmath50 correspond to the electron velocity components and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the coordinates that follow the drift of the electron s orbit . in order to incorporate dissipative effect we added the damping term @xmath53 the dynamical equations .",
    "this procedure yields a simple scheme to incorporate dissipation to the quantum system .",
    "recent magnetoresistance experiments@xcite and theory @xcite suggest , that in 2des , electron - electron interaction provide an important contribution to the inelastic scattering rate , giving rise to @xmath54 temperature dependance .",
    "consequently , in what follows we shall assume that the inelastic scattering rate is given by @xmath55 @xcite , where @xmath56 is the fermi energy .",
