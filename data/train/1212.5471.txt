    "there have been a number of theoretical studies of mixed - spin ising ferrimagnets as simple models of certain types of molecular - based magnetic materials @xcite . besides other interesting properties , such as appearance of a multicritical behavior , they attract attention due to so - called compensation behavior with possible technological applications .",
    "such a phenomenon occurs at a compensation temperature , i.e. , the temperature below the critical point at which the sublattice magnetizations completely cancel out and the total magnetization changes sign . generally speaking , from the previous studies",
    "it can be concluded that the higher values of spins and the more complex lattice topologies used the richer behavior can be expected .",
    "however , the increasing complexity usually requires increasing simplifications in the approaches for the problem to be manageable .",
    "thus nonperturbative approaches , such as exact @xcite or monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite , are so far limited to the simplest cases of either the smallest spin values ( i.e. , mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ) or the lattice topology ( e.g. , honeycomb or bethe lattices ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the behavior of the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 ising system is rather well understood , while there are still disagreements among different theoretical investigations of the mixed - spin systems with higher spin values , including the spin-1 and spin-3/2 case .",
    "the disagreements arise from the fact that due to higher complexity mostly different approximative schemes with various degrees of approximation have been employed , such as mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite , effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite and cluster variational theory ( cvt ) @xcite .",
    "these approximative approaches have been previously shown to produce some artifacts , such as a tricritical point , predicted by mft @xcite and eft @xcite for the mixed spin-1/2 and spin-1 system on a square lattice , that were not reproduced either in numerical transfer matrix @xcite or mc studies @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the results of these approximative studies for the mixed spin-1 and spin-3/2 system have so far been verified by mc simulations only for the case of a simple cubic lattice @xcite . however , for this particular case , there were basically no qualitative disagreements among the conclusions drawn from the respective studies and the mc results only confirmed the previously obtained results .",
    "on the other hand , for the cases of honeycomb and square lattices , there are qualitative differences in the results , which have not been resolved yet .",
    "+ the objective of this study is to focus on the case of the mixed spin-1 and spin-3/2 ising system with a uniform single - ion anisotropy on a square lattice , for which the differences between the mft , eft and cvt results are the most prominent . in particular , we aim to answer the following questions : ( 1 ) are the phase transitions of second order for the entire range of the anisotropy strength , as predicted by cvt , or is there a tricritical point separating lines of the second- and first - order transitions , as predicted by both mft and eft ? ( 2 ) is there a reentrant phenomenon in the second - order phase boundary , as suggested by the cvt results but not by mft nor eft ? ( 3 ) does the line of first - order transitions situated within the ordered ferrimagnetic region , obtained by cvt but not by mft nor eft , really exist ? ( 4 ) can the system display up to two compensation points , as predicted by both mft and eft ( not investigated by cvt ) ?",
    "the model of the mixed spin-1 and spin-3/2 ising system on the square lattice is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 @xmath4 for @xmath5 ions , @xmath6 for @xmath7 ions , @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbor coupling parameter between the ions on a and b sublattices , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the single - ion anisotropies acting on the spin-3/2 and spin-1 ions , respectively . in this study",
    "we will consider the anisotropy of a uniform strength i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "+ a simulated @xmath12 square lattice consists of two interpenetrating sublattices , each one comprising @xmath13 sites .",
    "we consider linear lattice sizes ranging from @xmath14 up to @xmath15 with the periodic boundary conditions imposed .",
    "initial spin states are randomly assigned and the updating follows the metropolis dynamics .",
    "the lattice structure and the short range of the interactions enable vectorization of the algorithm . since the spins on one sublattice interact only with the spins on the other , each sublattice can be updated simultaneously .",
    "thus one sweep through the entire lattice involves just two sublattice updating steps . for thermal averaging ,",
    "we typically consider @xmath16 mc sweeps in the standard and up to @xmath17 mc sweeps in the histogram mc simulations @xcite , after discarding another @xmath18% of these numbers for thermalization .",
    "to assess uncertainity , we perform @xmath19 runs , using different random initial configurations .",
    "then the errors of the calculated quantities are determined from the values obtained for those runs as twice of the standard deviations .",
    "+ we calculate the internal energy per site @xmath20 and the sublattice magnetizations per site @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes thermal averages .",
    "the total magnetization per site is defined as @xmath24 since for ferrimagnets @xmath25 can vanish within the ordered phase at the compensation temperature , as an order parameter it is useful to define the staggered magnetization per site as @xmath26 further , the following quantities which are functions of the parameters @xmath27 or / and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) are defined : the specific heat per site @xmath30 @xmath31 the direct @xmath32 and staggered @xmath33 susceptibilities per site @xmath34 @xmath35 the logarithmic derivatives of @xmath36 and @xmath37 with respect to @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 the binder parameter @xmath41 @xmath42 and the fourth - order energy cumulant @xmath43 @xmath44 the above quantities are useful for localization of a phase transition as well as for determination of its nature .",
    "for example , the transition temperatures can be estimated from the locations of the peaks of the response functions @xmath30 and @xmath45 or , with a higher precision , from the intersection of the binder parameter @xmath41 curves for different lattice sizes @xmath46 .",
    "the first - order character of the transition can be judged from the presence of discontinuities in the magnetizations and energy , as well as from hysteresis loops .",
    "furthermore , the order of the transition can be reliably established by a finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis .",
    "for instance , the energy cumulant @xmath43 exhibits a minimum near critical temperature @xmath47 , which achieves the value @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 for a second - order transition , while @xmath50 is expected for a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "temperature - dependences of a variety of thermodynamic quantities display extrema at the @xmath46-dependent transition temperatures , which at a second - order transition are known to scale with a lattice size as , for example : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the critical exponents of the correlation length and susceptibility , respectively .",
    "more precise locations of the extrema used in fss can be obtained from histogram mc simulations @xcite , performed at criticality for each lattice size . in the case of a first - order transition",
    ", typically a bimodality appears in the @xmath56 and @xmath57 histograms as @xmath46 increases and the quantities ( [ eq.c])@xmath58([eq.v ] ) display a volume - dependent scaling , @xmath59 .",
    "as a function of the single - ion anisotropy strength @xmath60 .",
    "the inset shows the enlarged picture in a low - temperature region with both the critical ( @xmath61 ) and compensation ( @xmath62 ) temperature curves . ]    the critical temperature as a function of the anisotropy strength @xmath63 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - tc_comb ] , was determined from the positions of the staggered susceptibility @xmath64 peaks obtained by standard mc simulations for a fixed lattice size of @xmath65 .",
    "we checked that the peaks positions ( the temperatures at which they occur ) do not significantly change when larger @xmath46 is used .",
    "for the case of @xmath66 we estimated the critical temperature with relatively high precision from the binder parameter analysis , using the lattice sizes from @xmath65 up to @xmath67 and @xmath68 mc sweeps , as @xmath69 . in line with the mft @xcite , eft @xcite and cvt @xcite results , the critical temperature decreases as the anisotropy",
    "is decreased from positive to negative values and eventually vanishes at the exact value of @xmath70 . however ,",
    "in contrast to the cvt results , no signs of the reentrant phenomenon was observed near @xmath70 .",
    "namely , as temperature is increased from low values there is a single order - disorder phase transition for each value of @xmath71 and no phase transition below @xmath70 .     and specific heat @xmath30 ( inset ) per site and ( b ) the staggered magnetization @xmath72 and staggered susceptibility @xmath64 ( inset ) per site , as functions of the anisotropy strength @xmath60 , at @xmath73.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and specific heat @xmath30 ( inset ) per site and ( b ) the staggered magnetization @xmath72 and staggered susceptibility @xmath64 ( inset ) per site , as functions of the anisotropy strength @xmath60 , at @xmath73.,title=\"fig : \" ]    furthermore , no indications of the additional first - order transition line within the ordered phase at low temperatures , found in the cvt study , were observed . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ems - d ] we show anisotropy dependences of the staggered magnetization @xmath72 and energy @xmath74 , along with the respective response functions , @xmath64 and @xmath30 , shown in insets , at @xmath73 .",
    "it is well known that discontinuities in physical quantities associated with a first - order transition tend to smear out in mc simulations for smaller lattice sizes .",
    "therefore , in order to detect first - order transition features , we chose a relatively large size of @xmath75 and also checked for possible loops in the curves obtained by increasing and decreasing @xmath63 . according to @xcite",
    ", we should observe two anomalies associated with two phase transitions : the first - order one between two ordered phases and the second - order one between the ferrimagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",
    "however , as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig : ems - d ] , only one anomaly can be observed and , therefore , we conclude that there is only one phase transition which is from the ordered ferrimagnetic to the paramagnetic phase .",
    "this scenario agrees with the mft and eft predictions .",
    "however , the latter insist that in this low - temperature region , i.e. , below the tricritical point @xmath76 from mft and @xmath77 from eft , the transition is first - order , which does not appear so in our simulations , since no discontinuities nor loops in the staggered magnetization and internal energy curves can be seen .",
    "+ nevertheless , the respective spike - like response functions , which are somewhat reminiscent of a first - order transition , prompted us to further explore the order of the transition by running more extensive histogram mc simulations for even larger sizes @xmath46 and performing fss analysis .",
    "we considered the lattice sizes up to @xmath15 and the number of mc sweeps @xmath78 , however , we did not detect any signs of a bimodal distribution in the energy or staggered magnetization histograms at criticality that would signal a first - order transition . on the contrary , fss of the quantities ( [ eq.chi])@xmath58([eq.d2 ] ) , shown in fig .  [ fig : loglog ]",
    ", indicates that the calculated susceptibility and correlation length critical exponents , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , agree well with the standard 2d ising ones , i.e. , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . in the susceptibility exponent dependence we can see that a linear regime in the log - log behavior is established only at @xmath83 and , therefore , sufficiently large lattice sizes should be used .",
    "the second - order nature of the transition is also confirmed by the scaling of the minima of the fourth - order energy cumulant @xmath43 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v - l ] ) , which tend to the value @xmath84 for @xmath85 and apparently do not scale with volume , as expected for the second - order transition .",
    "such thorough investigations were not done below @xmath73 and we can not rule out the possibility of the tricritical point existence at still lower temperatures but we deem it unlikely and presume that the transition remains second - order at all temperatures .    ) @xmath58([eq.d2 ] ) for the parameter @xmath86 i.e. , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , in a log - log plot at the critical point @xmath90 .",
    "the slopes represent the values of the standard 2d ising exponents ratios @xmath91 and @xmath92 . ]     as a function of @xmath93 .",
    "the solid horizontal line denotes @xmath94 . ]",
    "finally , we verified the mft @xcite and eft @xcite predictions about the multicompensation behavior of the system .",
    "namely , these theories predict the existence of two compensation points at the anisotropy values close to @xmath95 .",
    "such a behavior was indeed confirmed in our mc simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig : m - t_reent ] we plot the total magnetization vs temperature curves for several values of the anisotropy strength @xmath96 .",
    "while for @xmath97 there is no compensation point , for the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , there are two compensation points below the respective critical temperatures @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for @xmath102 , there is only one compensation point below @xmath103 .",
    "the entire curve of the compensation temperature @xmath62 as a function of the anisotropy strength @xmath60 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : d - tc_comb ] .    .",
    "there is no compensation point for @xmath97 , two compensation points for @xmath98 and @xmath99 and one compensation point for @xmath102 .",
    "@xmath104 , @xmath105 , denote the critical temperatures corresponding to the respective values of @xmath106 . ]",
    "we have studied the critical and compensation properties of the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 ising ferrimagnet with a uniform single - ion anisotropy on a square lattice by monte carlo simulations .",
    "we focused on several contradictory results previously obtained by different approximative approaches .",
    "in particular , we checked if the system for sufficiently large anisotropy strength can display a reentrant phenomenon and additional first - order phase transition within the ordered ferrimagnetic phase , as predicted by cvt .",
    "neither of these predictions was confirmed .",
    "instead , we found just one order - disorder phase boundary as a single - valued function of the anisotropy within the entire range of values , in agreement with the mft and eft results .",
    "thus , while for the system on a cubic lattice the qualitative features predicted by cvt were confirmed by the mc simulations @xcite , they were not confirmed on a square lattice . on the other hand , our findings neither support the mft and eft predictions about the existence of a tricritical point at which the transition would change to the first order one .",
    "nevertheless , the multicompensation behavior with two compensation points observed within the mft and eft studies was reliably verified in the current mc simulations .",
