    "the following one - parameter deformations of the exponential and logarithm functions @xmath13 which reduce to the standard exponential and logarithm respectively as the real deformation parameter @xmath1 approaches to zero , has been introduced recently in ref .",
    "the above functions have many very interesting properties @xcite ( some being identical to the ones of the undeformed functions ) that permit to construct a statistical mechanics ( and thermodynamics ) which generalizes the standard boltzmann - gibbs one .",
    "this @xmath1-deformed statistical mechanics preserves unaltered the structure of the ordinary one and can be used to explain a very large class of experimentally observed phenomena described by distribution functions exhibiting power law tails .",
    "the areas where this formalism can be applied include among others , low and high energy physics , astrophysics , econophysics , geology , biology , mathematics , information theory , linguistics , etc . @xcite .    in ref .",

    "the coefficient @xmath8 , which also absorbs the boltzmann constant @xmath16 , depends on a free parameter @xmath9 ( see eq .",

    "@xcite ) which remains to be determined together with the parameter @xmath3 which contains the information about the temperature @xmath17 of the system .",
    "a first question which arises naturally is if it is possible and how to find any criterion which allows us to fix the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath9 or at least express these in terms of the deformation parameter @xmath1 , in order to reduce the free parameters of the theory .",
    "a second question regards the properties of the entropy @xmath10 .",
    "it is well known that the boltzmann - shannon entropy @xmath6 is concave , additive and extensive .",
    "we know that @xmath10 is concave with respect to the variable @xmath5 , but what happens about its additivity and extensivity ?",
    "more in general , beside the boltzmann - shannon entropy other concave , additive and extensive entropies do exist ?",
    "a third question is related to the physical mechanism which originates the deformation introduced by the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , does a more fundamental theory exist where this deformation emerges , or is it simply a purely mathematical tool ?",
    "a fourth question is if it is possible to extend the theory originally developed in the framework of a classical kinetics to treat statistical systems in the context of a relativistic kinetics .",
    "a fifth question regards the deformation parameter @xmath1 .",
    "this parameter will continue to remain free or is it possible to determine its value self consistently within the theory ?    the present paper deals with the above questions and its purpose is double .",
    "firstly , we will show that @xmath10 is the unique existing , concave , additive and extensive entropy , beside the boltzmann - shannon entropy . as we will see these properties of @xmath10 are sufficient to determine unequivocally the values of parameters @xmath3 and @xmath9 .",
    "secondly , we will show that the deformation introduced by @xmath1 is a purely relativistic effect and then we will explain the deformation mechanism within the einstein special relativity .",
    "then , we will formulate a relativistic @xmath1-kinetics and we will calculate the value of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in order to test the predictability and correctness of theory here proposed we will consider two sets of experimental data .",
    "in particular we will analyze the cosmic rays spectrum which spans 13 decades in energy and 33 decades in particle flux that , as it is widely known , violates the boltzmann - gibbs statistics .",
    "as we will see , we have a high quality agreement between the theory and the observed data .",
    "the paper is organized as it follows . in sect .",
    "ii , generalizing the approach proposed in ref.s @xcite , we introduce a class of one parameter deformed structures and study their mathematical properties .    in sect .",
    "iii , within this context , starting from the jaynes maximum entropy principle we consider the most general class of deformed statistical mechanics preserving the main features of the standard boltzmann - gibbs one .    in sect .",
    "iv , we show that the entropy @xmath10 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite is the only one existing beside the boltzmann - shannon entropy @xmath6 which is simultaneously concave , additive and extensive .",
    "then the statistical mechanics and thermodynamics based on @xmath10 can be viewed as a natural extension of the boltzmann - gibbs one , recovering this last as the deformation parameter @xmath1 approaches to zero .    in sect .",
    "v , we consider the mean properties of @xmath1-exponential and @xmath1-logarithm which have a fundamental role in the formulation of the new statistical mechanics .    in sect .",
    "vi , we extend the formalism to a time dependent and relativistic context . in particular after introducing the relativistic @xmath1-kinetic evolution equation we study its stationary state and prove the h - theorem .    in sect .",
    "vii , we explain the origin of the @xmath1-deformation and show that it emerges naturally within the einstein special relativity .    in sect .",
    "viii , we propose an approach which permits to determine within the special relativity the value of the parameter @xmath1 .    in sect .",

    "we have shown that beside the boltzmann - shannon entropy , the quantity @xmath478 with @xmath479 and @xmath480 , is the only existing entropy , simultaneously concave , additive and extensive .",
    "starting from this entropy it is possible to construct a generalized statistical mechanics ( and thermodynamics ) having the same mathematical and epistemological structure of the boltzmann - gibbs one , which is recovered when the deformation parameter @xmath1 approaches to zero . within this",

    "the chemical potential @xmath177 can be fixed by the normalization condition .",
    "this distribution has a bulk very close to the exponential one while its tail decays following a power law @xmath484 .",
    "we have shown that , within the special relativity , it is possible to determine the value of @xmath1 , obtaining in this case @xmath485 so that the relativistic statistical meechanics does not contain free parameters",

    "in particular we find a high quality agreement in analyzing the spectrum of the cosmic rays which violates manifestly the boltzmann - gibbs statistics .",
    "this is an important test for the theory because the cosmic rays are relativistic particles and their spectrum has a very large extension ( @xmath438 decades in energy and @xmath441 decades in flux ) .",

    "<S> in ref . [ physica a * 296 * , 405 ( 2001 ) ] , starting from the one parameter deformation of the exponential function @xmath0 , a statistical mechanics has been constructed which reduces to the ordinary boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics as the deformation parameter @xmath1 approaches to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution @xmath2 obtained within this statistical mechanics shows a power law tail and depends on the non specified parameter @xmath3 , containing all the information about the temperature of the system . on the other hand , the entropic form @xmath4 , which after maximization produces the distribution @xmath5 and reduces to the standard boltzmann - shannon entropy @xmath6 as @xmath7 , contains the coefficient @xmath8 whose expression involves , beside the boltzmann constant , another non specified parameter @xmath9 .    in the present effort </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath10 is the unique existing entropy obtained by a continuous deformation of @xmath6 and preserving unaltered its fundamental properties of concavity , additivity and extensivity . </S>",
    "<S> these properties of @xmath10 permit to determine unequivocally the values of the above mentioned parameters @xmath3 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we explain the origin of the deformation mechanism introduced by @xmath1 and show that this deformation emerges naturally within the einstein special relativity . furthermore , we extend the theory in order to treat statistical systems in a time dependent and relativistic context . </S>",
    "<S> then , we show that it is possible to determine in a self consistent scheme within the special relativity the values of the free parameter @xmath1 which results to depend on the light speed @xmath11 and reduces to zero as @xmath12 recovering in this way the ordinary statistical mechanics and thermodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the novel statistical mechanics here presented preserves unaltered the mathematical and epistemological structure of the ordinary statistical mechanics and is suitable to describe a very large class of experimentally observed phenomena in low and high energy physics and in natural , economic and social sciences . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in order to test the correctness and predictability of the theory , as working example we consider the cosmic rays spectrum , which spans 13 decades in energy and 33 decades in flux , finding a high quality agreement between our predictions and observed data . </S>"
