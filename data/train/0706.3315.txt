    "final state interaction ( fsi ) effects have been observed in @xmath3 collisions .",
    "they are responsible of strangeness enhancement , @xmath4 supression , fixed @xmath0 supression , azimuthal asymmetry , ... is it the manifestation of the formation of a new state of matter or can it be described in a fsi model with no reference to an equation of state , thermalization , hydrodynamics , ...  ?",
    "we take the latter view and try to describe all these obseervables within a unique formalism  : the well known gain and loss differential equations .",
    "we assume @xcite that , at least for particles with @xmath0 larger than @xmath5 , the interaction with the hot medium produces a @xmath0-shift @xmath6 towards lower values and thus the yield at a given @xmath0 is reduced .",
    "there is also a gain term due to particles produced at @xmath7 . due to the strong decrease of the @xmath0-distributions with increasing @xmath0 ,",
    "the loss is much larger than the gain .",
    "asuming boost invariance and dilution of the densities in @xmath8 due to longitudinal expansion , we obtain [ 1e ] dn_^0 ( b , s , p _ ) d= - n(b , s )    here @xmath9 is the transverse density of the medium and @xmath10 the corresponding one of the @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this has to be integrated between initial time @xmath11 and freeze - out time @xmath12 .",
    "the solution deepnds only on @xmath13 .",
    "we use @xmath14  mb at both energies and @xmath15 for @xmath16  gev and @xmath17 for @xmath18  gev @xcite .",
    "( [ 1e ] ) at small @xmath19 describes an interaction at the partonic level",
    ". indeed , here the densities are very large and the hadrons not yet formed . at later times",
    "the interaction is hadronic .",
    "most of the effect takes place in the partonic phase .",
    "we use a single ( effective ) value of @xmath20 for all values of the proper time @xmath19 .",
    "the results at rhic and lhc are given in fig .  1 .",
    "at lhc only shadowing @xcite has been included in the initial state .",
    "the suppression is given by the dashed line .",
    "it coincides with @xmath21 for @xmath0 large enough  when shadowing and cronin efffects are no longer present .",
    "the lhc suppression is thus a factor of two larger than at rhic .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 7.45 cm    -0.25 cm    -7.45 cm = 7.5 cm = 7.45 cm    -0.25 cm    -0.3 cm",
    "final state interaction in our approach gives rise to a positive @xmath2 @xcite ( no need for an equation of state or hydro ) .",
    "indeed , when the @xmath1 is emitted at @xmath22 its path length is maximal ( maximal absorption ) . in order to compute it",
    "we assume that the density of the hot medium is proportional to the path length @xmath23 of the @xmath1 inside the interaction region determined by its transverse position @xmath24 and its azimuthal angle @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we replace @xmath26 by @xmath27@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath1 path length and @xmath30 denotes its average over @xmath25 .",
    "( in this way the averaged transverse density @xmath26 is unchanged ) .",
    "the suppression @xmath31 depends now on @xmath25 and @xmath2 is given by [ 2e ] v_2(b , p _ ) = d_r s_^0 ( b , p _ , _ r ) 2 _ r d_r s_^0 ( b , p _ , _ r ) the results at rhic and lhc are presented in fig .",
