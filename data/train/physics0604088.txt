    "one of the long - sought experimental capabilities in modern atomic physics and quantum optics is the ability to load a single atom in a microscopic volume for an extended time and to manipulate and probe its internal and external states at will . in recent years",
    ", several groups have developed technics for trapping and controlling a single or a few neutral atoms based on tightly localized magneto - optical traps or dipole traps @xcite .",
    "single or a - few - atom traps have been applied to wide range of fields such as cavity quantum electrodynamics studies @xcite , experiments on single - photon generation on demand @xcite , and even archeological dating of ancient aquifers @xcite .",
    "the most distinctive signature of single atom trapping is the quantized fluorescence signal .",
    "when the number of trapped atoms is decreased to single - atom level , the fluorescence signal from atoms exhibits stepwise underlying variation in time and the size of the fluorescence signal with respect to a background level is interpreted as being proportional to the instantaneous number of atoms in the trap .",
    "such stepwise fluorescence signals have been regarded as the most definitive evidence for single atom trapping . with this understanding ,",
    "one can obtain the atom - number distribution in the trap from the histogram of the fluorescence signal levels and can also identify individual loading and loss events of atoms in the trap @xcite .    in actual single - atom trap experiments , since the fluorescence signal from a single atom is extremely weak , one needs to choose a bin time for photon counting as long as possible in order to achieve enough signal to noise ratio .",
    "if the bin time is too long , however , the atom number can change several times during the bin time and thus the observed fluorescence no longer provides accurate information on the instantaneous atom number .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", therefore , several questions naturally arise regarding the conditions under which the fluorescence measurement should be performed : what will be the optimal size for the bin time , what determines the shape of the signal distribution and thus what information one can get from the observed signal distribution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer these questions .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way . in sec .",
    "ii , we define the problem and derive analytic expressions for the signal distributions in two limiting cases , long and short bin time limits , along with signal - to - noise considerations . these results are compared with numerical simulations in sec .",
    "iii , where an iterative method and monte carlo simulations are employed to calculate steady - state atom number distribution functions and the signal distributions regardless of the size of the bin time . in sec .",
    "iv , an optimal size of the bin time is identified for minimizing the probability of indeterminate atom numbers while providing accurate information on the instantaneous number of atoms in the trap .",
    "the analytic expressions and numerical results are then compared with experimental results in sec .  v. it is demonstrated that the experimental signal distribution is well fit by our theoretical model and from observed signal distributions one can extract information not only on the number of atoms but also on the state of atoms in the trap . in sec .",
    "vi , we summarize our findings and draw conclusions .",
    "in a few - atom trap , the fluorescence signal from atoms , induced by a probe laser or by a weak trap laser itself in the case of a magneto - optic trap ( mot ) , is proportional to the number of atoms in the trap .",
    "the fluorescence signal is measured with a photodetector , usually in photon counting mode with photon counting electronics .",
    "suppose the signal counts are successively taken in time for a preset bin time of @xmath0 .",
    "the signal counts @xmath1 measured in @xmath2 time bin , specified as @xmath3 with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , can be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the instantaneous number of atoms in the trap ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the counting rate of fluorescence from @xmath10 atom , and @xmath11 is the counting rate of background signal such as detector dark counts and scattered laser light or stray room light .",
    "the bin time @xmath0 is assumed to be much larger than spontaneous emission lifetime of atoms , typically tens of nanoseconds .",
    "the signal @xmath12 is truncated to the nearest integer by the counting electronics .",
    "the instantaneous number of atoms @xmath7 rapidly fluctuates due to various stochastic processes .",
    "temporal change of its probability distribution function @xmath13 is governed by the following master equation : @xmath14p_{n}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\gamma_{1}(n+1)p_{n+1}+\\gamma_{2}{n+2\\choose2}p_{n+2}\\ ; , \\label{eq : mastereq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 is loading rate of atoms into the trap , @xmath18 is the one - atom loss rate due to collisions with background gas , @xmath19 is the two - atom loss rate due to light - assisted intra - trap collisions @xcite .",
    "the master equation eq.([eq : mastereq ] ) can not be solved analytically . however , for a microscopic trap with only a few atoms in a volume of a few micron in diameter , the two - atom loss terms proportional to @xmath20 are negligibly small , and thus approximate expressions for @xmath21 and the number correlation function @xmath22 can be obtained @xcite with @xmath23 denoting a time average . for",
    "now , we just neglect the two - atom loss terms .",
    "the analysis including these terms will be discussed later .    without the @xmath19 terms , the master equation eq.([eq : mastereq ] )",
    "becomes the same as the simple birth - death model of population @xcite , yielding a poisson distribution in steady state with a mean value @xmath24 and a variance @xmath25 .",
    "for a few - atom trap with @xmath26 , the correlation decay time @xmath27 of the number correlation function is given by @xmath28 and is the measure of the average time during which @xmath7 remains constant @xcite .",
    "when @xmath20 terms are not negligible , the correlation decay time is a complicate function of @xmath17 , @xmath29 and @xmath20 and always smaller than @xmath30 due to the additional two - atom loss process @xcite .",
    "we denote the correlation decay time in this case as @xmath31 in order to distinguish it from the above definition of @xmath27 for the @xmath32 case .",
    "the correlation decay time is also called the trap decay time for macroscopic traps .    the signal distribution shows much different behaviors depending on the size of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath27 . for analytic analysis",
    "we consider two limiting cases , long bin time ( @xmath33 ) and short bin time ( @xmath34 ) , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : example ] . in the long bin time limit , there exist many loading and loss events in a single bin time whereas the atom number hardly changes during the bin time in the short bin time limit , and thus these two limiting cases lead to quite different signal distributions .     and",

    "the atoms move independently from each other inside the mot . due to the spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field",
