    "in constructing a higher dimensional quantum field theory , the regularization and the continuum limit are two important keys . particularly , the problem of the limit associates with hard difficulty in the higher dimensional case .",
    "statistical mechanics usually insists that critical behaviors of the phase transition in the theory are equivalent to those of a mean field theory , which has only a trivial fixed point .",
    "many pioneering works on lattice gauge theories were trying to overcome the difficulty @xcite , although the continuum limit is not taken strictly . where is the continuum limit ? by using well - known 4-dimensional theories such as qed and qcd ,",
    "is it possible to construct the continuum limit by the related critical behavior near the critical point ?",
    "our purpose is to construct a @xmath0-dimensional pure yang - mills theory by arranging a number of 4-dimensional yang - mills theories with appropriate couplings .",
    "a @xmath0-dimensional lattice space is decomposed into @xmath1 layers with 4 dimensions like as fig.[fig : layer ] . originally , fu and nielsen investigated the system to show dynamical dimensional reduction by using the characteristic vacuum which confines for extra dimensional directions and deconfines for 4 dimensions called a layer phase @xcite .",
    "we do not assume that the layer phase exists , but use only the decomposition .        from now , we focus on a 5-dimensional theory to study the possibility of the construction for higher dimensional field theories explicitly but an extension to general dimensions",
    "shall be mentioned in the final section .",
    "our starting action for @xmath2 gauge group is written as    @xmath3    + \\frac{\\beta_{5}}{2}\\sum_{p_{5}}\\left[2-\\tr u_{p_{5}}\\right ] ,   \\label{lact}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is proportional to a usual 4-dimensional coupling constant inside a layer and @xmath5 is a coupling constant between neighboring layers .",
    "@xmath6 implies a plaquette inside a layer and @xmath7 does a plaquette between neighboring layers .",
    "to display the phase diagram explicitly , two order parameters are introduced ; ( 1 ) creutz ratio ( @xmath8 ) for 4-dimensional wilson loops and ( 2 ) 5-dimensional polyakov loop ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "since a theory with @xmath10 is equivalent to a pure 4-dimensional yang - mills theory which is one phase , we expect a phase structure such as fig.[fig : phase1 ] .",
    "we have calculated numerically these parameters for the system and obtained the numerical phase diagram in fig.[fig : phase2 ] . in the figure , along line i we can see both 4-dimensional and 5-dimensional deconfinement transitions in the large @xmath5 . by wider calculations along lines",
    "ii , we recognize the phase transition is of 1st order near @xmath11 .",
    "the results of lines iii and iv suggest that both 4-dimensional and 5-dimensional deconfinement transitions in the small @xmath5 are of 2nd or weakly 1st order , because we can not see any hysteresis loop in the coupling region .",
    "this critical point in the @xmath12 is noted as @xmath13 .",
    "our surprising remark is that the diagram fig.[fig : phase2 ] is not quantitatively changed for various @xmath14 and its stable property may help us to take the limit @xmath15 .",
    "our simple consideration finds our way to existence of a 4-dimensional continuum system with finite inter - layer coupling(@xmath5 ) . near the critical point ( @xmath16 ) , the inverse ( @xmath17 ) of correlation length for polyakov loop",
    "is written as @xmath18 where the value of @xmath19 is approximately 0.6 and @xmath20 implies the critical exponent which is 0.5 in a mean field theory .",
    "we call the picture that many gauge fields on different layers interacts each other with finite coupling as multi - layer world .",
    "it is noted that link variables with 5-th direction behave as bi - fundamental fields with a finite coupling .",
    "can we construct a 5-dimensional space not an internal space ?",
