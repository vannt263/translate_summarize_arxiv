    "at the conclusion of an all - pay auction , all bidders must pay the bids they submitted , with only the highest bidder receiving the item . with this idea in mind",
    ", one can play a variant of a two - player game using an all - pay auction to decide who moves next instead of simply alternating between players .",
    "for example , one could play all - pay tic - tac - toe with @xmath0 chips . each round",
    "both players privately record their bids and then simultaneously reveal them . if player a bids @xmath1 and his opponent bids @xmath2 , player a would get to choose a square to mark and the next round of bidding would begin wih player @xmath3 having @xmath4 chips , player @xmath5 having @xmath6 chips .",
    "note that the chips have no value outside the game and only serve to determine who moves - the ultimate goal is still just to get three - in - a - row .",
    "another variant of the game could have only the player who wins the move pay his / her bid , i.e. deciding who moves next using a first - price auction .",
    "these games were first studied formally in the 1980s by richman , whose work has since then been greatly expanded upon . intuitively , there is less risk in these `` richman games '' for the player losing the bid .",
    "if your opponent bids @xmath0 for a certain move , it makes no difference whether your bid was @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "all that matters is that your opponent s bid was higher .",
    "a surprising consequence of this single - pay structure is that for every state of a game , there exists a `` richman value '' @xmath9 for each player that represents the proportion of the total chips that player would need to hold to have a deterministic winning strategy . in this situation",
    ", the player with the winning strategy can tell her opponent what bid she will be making next without affecting her ability to ultimately win . for zero - sum games , this means that unless a player s chip ratio is exactly @xmath9 , then one of the players must have such a winning strategy @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our objective is to begin the formal study of all - pay bidding games .",
    "returning to the above example where your opponent bids @xmath0 chips and you are indifferent between bidding @xmath7 and @xmath8 , it is clear this is no longer true for an all - pay bidding mechanism .",
    "you would be very disappointed had you bid @xmath7 , as your opponent would be paying just @xmath10 chip on net to make a move .",
    "had you bid @xmath8 , though , you might feel pretty good about not moving this current turn , as the @xmath0 extra chips may make a bigger difference for the rest of the game .",
    "thus , there are at least two bidding scenarios which intuitively seem like very good positions to be in : winning the bid by a relatively small number of chips or losing the bid by a relatively large number of chips .",
    "this behavior suggests that , unlike in richman games , in all - pay bidding games one of the players will not necessarily have a deterministic winning strategy .",
    "instead , players must randomize their bidding in some way .",
    "thus , we must appeal to the concept of mixed bidding strategies in nash equilibria .      before presenting formal definitions and results ,",
    "we provide a sample all - pay bidding game to illustrate some of the main features of playing these games .",
    "alice and bob , each with @xmath0 chips , are playing all - pay bidding tic - tac - toe .",
    "each turn alice and bob secretly write down a bid , a whole number less than or equal to their total number of chips .",
    "they then reveal their bids and whoever bid more gets to decide who makes the next move .",
    "we say a player has * advantage * if , when players bid the same amount , that player gets to decide who makes the next move .",
    "the question of deciding how to assign advantage is one we encountered early on . for our games , we give advantage to the player with more chips , then arbitrarily let alice have advantage when alice and bob have the same number of chips .",
    "a number of other mechanisms would also suffice , such as alternating advantage or having a special `` tie - breaking '' chip that grants advantage and is passed each time it is used .",
    "our choice was made in the interest of computational simplicity and to eventually allow extension to real - valued bidding .",
    "_ first move .",
    "_ both players have @xmath0 chips .",
    "alice bids @xmath2 , bob bids @xmath1 .",
    "bob wins the right to move and plays in the center of the board .",
    "_ second move .",
    "_ alice has @xmath6 chips , bob has @xmath4 chips .",
    "alice wants to win this move to keep pace with bob , but also does not see why it should be worth more than the first , so she only slightly increases her bid to @xmath11 .",
    "bob , thinking that alice may want to win this move more , is content to let alice win and collect chips by bidding @xmath8 .",
    "alice wins the right to move and plays in the top - left corner of the board .        _",
    "third move .",
    "_ alice has @xmath4 chips , bob has @xmath6 chips .",
    "alice bids @xmath12 , bob bids @xmath1 , so alice wins the right to move and plays in the top - center of the board .",
    "_ fourth move .",
    "_ alice has @xmath13 chips , bob has @xmath14 chips .",
    "alice is one move away from winning and decides to risk it and bid all of her @xmath13 chips .",
    "unfortunately for her , bob has guessed her move and has himself bid @xmath13 as well .",
    "because bob has more chips overall , he uses his advantage to win the tie and plays in the top - right corner of the board , blocking alice s victory and setting himself up for one .        _ fifth move .",
    "_ alice has @xmath13 chips , bob has @xmath14 chips .",
    "bob has more chips and is just a move away from winning , so he can bid everything , play in the bottom - left corner and win the game .    in normal tic - tac - toe",
    ", both players can guarantee a draw by playing well , but as we see from this example , the result of a game of all - pay tic - tac - toe involves far more chance .",
    "for example , at the fourth move in the above game , alice could have guessed bob might bid @xmath13 and chosen to `` duck '' by bidding @xmath8 . in this case bob would win the move and play as before , but now the chip counts would be @xmath15 to @xmath1 in alice s favor , and alice can bid @xmath1 and then @xmath13 to win the next two moves and win in the left column .",
    "it is easy to see that if a player knows what his opponent will bid at each move , he can win the game easily .",
    "thus , in the vast majority of all - pay bidding games , optimal play can not be deterministic .",
    "though we do not return to tic - tac - toe in this paper , it served as a test game for much of our research .",
    "using our results , we built a computer program to play all - pay bidding tic - tac - toe optimally .",
    "the program can be played against at http://biddingttt.herokuapp.com .",
    "the theory behind this program , which is not specific to tic - tac - toe , will be the focus of the rest of the paper .",
    "our ultimate goal is to characterize the optimal strategies for a general class of all - pay bidding games .",
    "the game consists of iterations of both players bidding for the right to move followed by one of the players making a move . in turn",
    ", an optimal strategy will also have two parts : the bid strategy and the move strategy .",
    "for a given position in the game ( e.g. a configuration of the tic - tac - toe board ) and chip counts for each of the players ( e.g. alice has @xmath6 chips , bob has @xmath4 chips ) , the bid strategy must tell players how to best randomize their bets ( e.g. alice bids @xmath8 chips half the time , @xmath13 chips half the time ) while the move strategy must tell whoever wins the bid the best move to make ( e.g. where to play on the tic - tac - toe board ) .",
    "the problem of determining move strategy is largely combinatorial in nature and remains similar to its analog in richman games .",
    "we can still represent the space of game states as a directed graph , and there is a not always a single best move that each player can make upon winning the bid .",
    "that is , the best move could also depend on each player s chip counts moving forward .    the focus of our work , then , will be on determining the optimal bidding strategy for any game position and chip counts .",
    "naturally , this should depend on a player s chances of winning in any of the possible subsequent game situations ( i.e. after a single move and updated chip counts ) . for purposes of initial analysis",
    ", we will assume that these future winning probabilities are known , and see how the bidding strategy can be determined from this information .",
    "then , by using the recursive nature of the directed graph , we will be able to start from the `` win '' and `` loss '' nodes ( where the probability is just @xmath10 or @xmath8 ) to find the optimal bidding strategies and winning probabilities for any game situation .",
    "for the rest of this paper , we will often refer to a bidding strategy as just a `` strategy '' when it is clear that the focus is just on the bidding side of the game . here",
    ", a strategy will be a probability vector where the @xmath16th coordinate corresponds to the probability a player will bid @xmath16 chips .",
    "further , a nash equilibrium for a game situation will just be a pair of strategies so that neither player has an incentive to deviate .",
    "this means that each player s strategy will maximize his / her minimum probability of ultimately winning from the next turn of the game .",
    "it quickly becomes apparent that a naive recursive algorithm using linear programming is feasible only for games with very few moves .",
    "thus , in the interest of being able to practically calculate the optimal bidding strategies for general games , we prove some structural results on the nash equilibria . in particular , useful structure arises when we study a particular class of games that we dubbed `` precise '' , which roughly speaking are games where having one more chip is strictly better than not .",
    "the key result is a surprising relationship between opposing optimal strategies that allows one to immediately write a nash equilibrium strategy for the player without advantage if given a nash equilibrium strategy for the player with advantage .",
    "this relationship , ( [ reverse_thm ] ) , which we call the reverse theorem , is a critical step toward the calculation of optimal strategies for precise games .",
    "further , by assigning an arbitrarily small value in the game to each chip , we get a precise game that is very similar to the original game .",
    "we show that the optimal strategies we can calculate for these new precise games will indeed converge to optimal strategies for our possibly imprecise games .",
    "our theoretical results ultimately culminate in a fast algorithm for computing optimal probabilistic bidding strategies .",
    "together with a move strategy for the combinatorial side of the game , this gives a complete characterization of optimal play for all - pay bidding games .",
    "let @xmath17 denote a single turn of a two - player all - pay bidding game @xmath18 where player @xmath3 is endowed with @xmath19 chips and player @xmath5 is endowed with @xmath20 chips .",
    "the underlying combinatorial game @xmath18 is a two - player zero - sum game , represented by an acyclic , colored , directed graph with two marked vertices , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the game begins by placing a token at some starting vertex . at each turn",
    ", a player moves the token to an adjacent vertex .",
    "player @xmath3 wins if the token reaches @xmath21 and player @xmath5 wins if the token reaches @xmath22 . by saying the graph is colored , this means that edges are one of two colors , say red and blue , such that @xmath3 can only move the token along red edges and @xmath5",
    "can only move the token along blue edges . to ensure consistency in the bidding strategy from turn to turn , we seek to avoid situations where the winner of a bid can be put in zugzwang - i.e. where it would be better to not move at all .",
    "thus , the bid winning player , rather than simply being able to move next , gets to determine who moves next . with this condition , @xmath18 can an asymmetric game where zugzwang is possible , like chess and many other popular two player games .",
    "the * payoff * , or value of the game , for player a at @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath23 $ ] and is equal to the probability that player a wins the game under optimal play . that is , we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 and calculate payoffs recursively",
    ". similarly , let @xmath26 denote the probability that player @xmath5 wins the game .",
    "often , when the chip counts or specific combinatorial game are not relevant to the discussion , the payoffs will be shortened to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that @xmath29 as we only study games that can not end in ties ( for the game of tic - tac - toe above , we can arbitrarily let one of the players win all draws ) .",
    "thus a * payoff matrix * for player a in @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath30 and is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the set of game positions that can be moved to from @xmath34 by @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the @xmath35 entry corresponds to player @xmath3 s probability of winning the game after @xmath3 bids @xmath36 and @xmath5 bids @xmath16 .",
    "note this is well - defined because the game is zero - sum : by moving to the game state that minimizes player @xmath3 s payoff , player @xmath5 is maximizing his own payoff at the same time ( and vice - versa ) .",
    "similarly , let @xmath37 denote the payoff matrix for player @xmath5 .",
    "we notice that if player @xmath3 bids @xmath38 and player @xmath5 bids @xmath39 , this is equivalent to player @xmath3 bidding @xmath40 and player @xmath5 bidding @xmath41 for any @xmath42 because the players are paying each other .",
    "thus , we have that payoff matrices are toeplitz , or diagonal - constant",
    ". we will write player @xmath3 s and player @xmath5 s payoff matrices for @xmath17 as @xmath43 respectively .",
    "we pause to consider a simple example .",
    "let the underlying game be one where player @xmath3 needs to make two moves to win , while player @xmath5 needs to make only one more move to win .",
    "suppose player @xmath3 has @xmath44 chips while player @xmath5 has @xmath45 chips .",
    "then we would get the following payoff matrices for player @xmath3 and player @xmath5 @xmath46 respectively    a * strategy * for player a in @xmath17 is given by an @xmath47-dimensional column vector with all non - negative entries that sum to 1 .",
    "the @xmath16-th entry of this vector ( where we start indexing at @xmath8 ) gives the probability that player @xmath3 will bid @xmath16 chips .",
    "similarly , a * strategy * for player @xmath5 in @xmath48 and is given by a @xmath49-dimensional column vector satisfying the same conditions .",
    "we denote a nash equilibrium strategy in the game @xmath48 as @xmath50 for player @xmath3 and as @xmath51 for player @xmath5",
    ". often times we will not be too explicit with the size of these vectors .",
    "it should be clear from context .    note",
    "that the @xmath16th row of @xmath52 corresponds to the payoffs of each of @xmath3 s pure strategies if her opponent @xmath5 bids @xmath16 .",
    "letting @xmath53 be the @xmath16th row of @xmath52 , we have @xmath54 , a weighted average of @xmath3 s pure payoffs when @xmath5 bids @xmath16 .",
    "thus , @xmath55 is player @xmath3 s probability of winning if her strategy is @xmath56 and her opponent purely bids @xmath16 .",
    "for example , if we have @xmath57 this means by playing @xmath56 , player @xmath3 wins @xmath58 of the time if player @xmath5 only bids @xmath8 and wins @xmath59 of the time if player @xmath5 only bids @xmath10 .    now ,",
    "if player @xmath5 s strategy is @xmath60 , @xmath61 , another weighted average of @xmath3 s payoffs for each of @xmath5 s pure strategies .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is exactly @xmath3 s payoff if she plays @xmath56 and her opponent plays @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath63 is @xmath5 s payoff in the same situation .",
    "continuing with the above example , if we now let @xmath64 then @xmath65 . so given strategies @xmath56 and @xmath60 for players @xmath3 and @xmath5 , player @xmath3 has a @xmath66 probability of winning .",
    "we compile these results in the lemma below .",
    "[ basics ] let @xmath67 and @xmath68 be payoff matrices for players @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , in @xmath71 .",
    "then the following statements are true .    *",

    "* let @xmath72 be the appropriately sized matrix whose entries are all 1",
    ". then @xmath73 .",
    "* suppose @xmath74 is a nash equilibrium .",
    "then @xmath75 if @xmath76 and @xmath77 if @xmath78 .",
    "this lemma provides the basic structure from which many of our main proofs will follow from later .",
    "it is clear that @xmath79 , since player @xmath3 can always bid as if he did not have the extra chip .",
    "we now define a class of games pivotal to our analysis in which this inequality is strict .",
    "formally , a game @xmath34 is called * precise * if in every successor state to @xmath34 , it is strictly better to have one more chip .",
    "[ precise_matrices ] we note that in particular , this guarantees a certain strict monotonicity among the entries of the payoff matrices",
    ". in particular , winning the bid by one less chip is always strictly preferable , as is losing by one more chip .",
    "thus we have that for the player with advantage , @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath80 for @xmath82 .",
    "a similar relationship holds for the player without advantage , except @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "a strategy @xmath85 has * length * @xmath86 if @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89 . a strategy @xmath85 is * gap - free * if @xmath90 if and only if @xmath91 @xmath92 .",
    "the definition of length encapsulates the observation that unless the game is close to completion , players will never bid a large proportion of their chips .",
    "the second definition seems more arbitrary at the moment , but it plays a pivotal role in the following proposition and will serve to greatly simplify the language throughout the paper .",
    "[ grounded_gapfree ] let @xmath71 be precise .",
    "any equilibrium strategy for the player with advantage is gap - free and bids @xmath8 with nonzero probability , while any equilibrium strategy for the other player is gap - free and bids 1 with nonzero probability .",

    "if @xmath98 and @xmath101 , player @xmath70 should alter his strategy so that he bids @xmath102 with probability @xmath103 and @xmath104 with probability 0 .",
    "this saves player @xmath70 a chip whenever he would have bid @xmath104 without changing any possible outcome of these bids , and all other possibilities are unchanged . by precision , this new strategy is strictly better than @xmath105 for player @xmath70 , a contradiction .",
    "this proves ( i ) .",
    "if @xmath106 and @xmath107 , player @xmath69 should alter her strategy so that she bids @xmath102 with probability @xmath108 and @xmath104 with probability 0 . as in the previous case",

    "together , ( i ) and ( ii ) complete the proof except in the case when @xmath109 .",
    "however , in this case an optimal strategy for player @xmath69 is to also bid 0 with probability 1 , and it follows that @xmath110 is not precise .",
    "this characterization of equilibrium strategies is what motivated our restriction to precise games . in the presence of precision , an easily observable , yet highly unexpected relationship between opposing optimal strategies appears .",

    "thus , we have a contradiction and @xmath401 can not have length less than @xmath331 .",
    "thus , @xmath401 has length @xmath331 , so by the same argument as the @xmath403 case , all the entries of @xmath427 are nonnegative .",
    "note that because none of the above reasoning depended upon player @xmath3 having advantage , if @xmath428 , we can apply the above argument from player @xmath5 s perspective .",
    "[ lengthsearch2 ] let the game be precise .",
    "let @xmath395 be a vector of all @xmath10 s .",
    "then for all @xmath429 , either @xmath430 is not invertible or @xmath397 will have all nonnegative entries .",
    "assume @xmath430 is invertible .",
    "we begin by showing there is no valid length @xmath431-strategy for player @xmath3 that produces the same payoff for player @xmath5 s first @xmath200 pure strategies .",
    "suppose there does exist such a strategy @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath9 be the payoff that @xmath85 produces against player @xmath5 s first @xmath200 pure strategies ( pure bids from @xmath8 up to @xmath111 ) .",
    "note that because @xmath56 has length @xmath111 there is a nash equilibrium strategy @xmath149 of length @xmath111 for player @xmath5 .",
    "we consider three cases :    ( 1 ) @xmath432 : :     +    since @xmath5 bids at most @xmath433 , we only need    to consider the first @xmath111 coordinates of    @xmath434 and @xmath435 . by our    assumption , @xmath436 so @xmath85 is strictly better    than @xmath56 against @xmath149 .",
    "thus    @xmath56 can not be a nash equilibrium strategy , which is a    contradiction .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath437 : :     +    if @xmath438 then let player @xmath5 use the    strategy @xmath439 .",
    "it is easy to verify that    @xmath439 produces the payoff    @xmath440 against player @xmath3 s first    @xmath200 pure strategies .",
    "thus , by similar reasoning as in    the previous case , @xmath439 is strictly better    than @xmath149 against @xmath56 , so    @xmath149 can not be a nash equilibrium strategy ,    which is a contradiction .",
    "( 3 ) @xmath441 : :     +    if @xmath442 , then    expanding the first @xmath200 coordinates of    @xmath435 results in the equations    @xmath443    for @xmath444 . considering the game from player    @xmath5 s perspective , note that @xmath439    gives @xmath5 a payoff of @xmath236 against    @xmath3 s first @xmath200 strategies . in    particular , @xmath5 s payoff against @xmath3 bidding    @xmath111 will be    @xmath445    @xmath5 s payoff @xmath38 against against    @xmath3 bidding @xmath200 will be    @xmath446 note that    because player @xmath3 is winning ties ,    @xmath447 ,    as in each case @xmath3 is winning by one more chip .",
    "thus ,    @xmath448    which means    @xmath449    similarly , @xmath5 s payoff if @xmath3 bids anything    greater than @xmath331 will be greater than @xmath236 .",
    "thus , @xmath439 is a nash equilibrium strategy of    length @xmath331 for player @xmath5 .",
    "note that if    @xmath331 is at least @xmath450 , then    @xmath439 will have length at least    @xmath450 , which will be a contradiction if    @xmath56 has length @xmath111 .",
    "since    @xmath451 , this means we must have    @xmath452 .",
    "then , @xmath439 is a nash    equilibrium strategy of length @xmath200 , so by theorem    [ noadvantagestrategies ] it must be of the form    @xmath453    for @xmath454 . in turn , @xmath85 must    be of the form    @xmath455 .    we can now write    @xmath456 as    @xmath457 ,    which can be expanded to the equation    @xmath458    +    by considering the first coordinate , we get the equation    @xmath459    so we must have    @xmath460 as    well . therefore ,    @xmath461    but since the game is precise , there must be an inequality for all the    coefficients :    @xmath462",
    "so    @xmath463    because not all the @xmath464 s are @xmath8 .",
    "thus , we    have a contradiction , and @xmath331 can not be    @xmath200 either .",
    "+    thus , no such strategy @xmath85 can exist , so if    @xmath430 is invertible ,    @xmath397 must have some negative    terms .",
    "we can implement the binary search algorithm as follows .",
    "let the lower bound , @xmath465 , start as @xmath10 .",
    "let the upper bound , @xmath466 , start as @xmath467 .",
    "* function * lsearch(@xmath52 , @xmath465 , @xmath466 )    by lemmas [ lengthsearch1 ] and [ lengthsearch2 ] , this algorithm will return the length of the optimal strategy for player @xmath3 .",
    "we can then apply our formula to directly compute player @xmath3 s unique optimal strategy .",
    "the reverse of this strategy is an optimal strategy for player @xmath5 .",
    "this completes the algorithm . from our results on the convergence of strategies ,",
    "this algorithm is also able to approximate , with any desired degree of accuracy , optimal strategies for imprecise games .",
    "so far , our results apply to the strategy for bidding on a single turn in an all - pay bidding game .",
    "this assumes some prior knowledge of successor game states that allows the payoff matrix to be already known .",
    "thus , to use our algorithm to compute nash equilibria for any all - pay bidding game state , we need some way of first finding the payoff matrix . by noting that the payoff matrices for end states ( where one player has already won )",
    "can be set as @xmath8 and @xmath10 for win and loss , we use recursion from the end states of the game to find the payoff matrix for an arbitrary turn .    consider a combinatorial game @xmath34 represented as a directed graph @xmath468 with two vertices marked as @xmath21 and @xmath22 and a token placed at some vertex of the graph .",
    "we can think of each vertex as the starting position of a subgame of @xmath34 .",
    "thus for player @xmath3 with @xmath19 chips and player @xmath5 with @xmath20 chips , the token on vertex @xmath278 , we write the game as @xmath469 .",
    "let @xmath470 give all the vertices that can be moved to from @xmath278 .",
    "we can compute @xmath27 as follows : @xmath471 then if @xmath3 bids @xmath16 and @xmath5 bids @xmath36 and @xmath3 makes a move then @xmath3 s payoff will be @xmath472 because @xmath3 will seek to maximize his probability of winning over all of his possible sucessor states . if @xmath3 bids @xmath16 and @xmath5 bids @xmath36 and @xmath5 makes a move then @xmath3 s payoff will be @xmath473 because @xmath5 will seek to minimize @xmath3 s probability of winning over all of her possible sucessor states .",
    "therefore @xmath474 as each player will consider the best possible scenario if he moves and the worst possible scenario if their opponent moves",
    ". then @xmath56 , @xmath60 can computed from this payoff matrix @xmath475 , using our algorithm from before .",
    "note this allows us to recurse up the directed graph from states @xmath21 and @xmath22 , first with values for those states , then values for the states one move away ( i.e. @xmath9 such that either @xmath21 or @xmath476 ) , then states two moves away , and so on .",
    "an arbitary @xmath477 matrix can be inverted in @xmath478 time using the gauss - jordan method .",
    "there exist , however , many more efficient algorithms specific to toeplitz matrices . in particular , the levinson - trench - zohar algorithm can solve a toeplitz system in @xmath479 time @xcite .    for an @xmath477 matrix ,",
    "the binary search algorithm requires @xmath480 iterations .",
    "each iteration requires solving one toeplitz system and scanning one vector for negative values .",
    "thus , the algorithm runs in time on the order of @xmath481 .",
    "thus finding an optimal strategy and corresponding payoff for a given payoff matrix requires time on the order of @xmath482 .",
    "a simple implementation of our recursive algorithm would take time growing exponentially with the depth of @xmath483 .",
    "we can greatly speed up this process by storing each @xmath484 that is computed .",
    "then when @xmath484 must be computed again the value can be looked up rather than recomputed . in the worst case , the program must compute @xmath27 for every possible combination of chips at every vertex .",
    "because the sum of the chips is constant , this requires at most @xmath485 computations .",
    "thus , the entire algorithm runs in time on the order of @xmath486 where @xmath487 . for comparison , a linear programming algorithm to achieve the same results would require time on the order of @xmath488 @xcite .",
