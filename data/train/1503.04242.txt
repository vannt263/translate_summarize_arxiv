    "electronic systems that have their fermi surface reduced to fermi points have received plenty of attention lately . in particular , recent progress on the problem of interacting dirac electrons , when the dispersion near the fermi points is linear in momentum , has indicated that these systems suffer a quantum phase transition with increasing interactions into a gapped phase , described well by the relativistic field theory of the gross - neveu - yukawa type  @xcite .",
    "a weak long - range component of the coulomb interaction appears to be an irrelevant perturbation at the quantum critical ( qc ) point , and the transition is essentially due to some of its short - range components becoming sufficiently large .",
    "when the dispersion near the fermi point(s ) is quadratic , on the other hand , the result is rather different . in the bilayer graphene , for example",
    ", it is one of many possible mass - gaps that opens up already at an infinitesimal interaction  @xcite .",
    "the finite density of states that accompanies such a quadratic band touching ( qbt ) in two dimensions ( 2d ) causes the long - range coulomb interaction , loosely speaking , to be screened , and at the same time the non - interacting ground state to be unstable at weak short - range interaction  @xcite .",
    "the situation in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems with qbt is maybe more interesting .",
    "qbt arises naturally in many gapless semiconductors , such as gray tin , mercury telluride , or certain pyrochlore iridates  @xcite , that feature band inversion due to the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the density of states at the qbt point now vanishes , and the long - range nature of the electron - electron interaction must be taken into account .",
    "it has been argued by abrikosov long ago @xcite , that the plain vanilla density - density coulomb interaction in a 3d system with the qbt should turn the ground state into an example of a scale - invariant non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) .",
    "such an exotic zero temperature phase would manifest itself in characteristic nontrivial power laws in temperature or frequency in various response functions of the system  @xcite .",
    "we have recently pointed out  @xcite , on the other hand , that a 3d system with the chemical potential at the qbt and the coulomb repulsion between the electrons may be unstable towards an insulating ground state with an anisotropic gap in the spectrum at low temperatures .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this instability was proposed to be the collision between the abrikosov s infrared stable nfl fixed point with another , qc point , which approaches it from the strong - coupling region as the spatial dimensionality of the system is taken to be decreasing from @xmath0 .",
    "the collision of fixed points has been studied as a mechanism behind several interesting instabilities in a variety of many - body systems in the past  @xcite . within the standard one - loop calculation it occurs here somewhat above and close to @xmath1 ,",
    "when both the nfl and the qc fixed points become complex and disappear from the physical space of real couplings . as a result",
    ", the coupling constants in the theory run away towards the values at which spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry appears to be the most favorable instability .",
    "the system in its interacting ground state would effectively appear as if it were under , in this case _ dynamically generated _",
    "furthermore , in the materials with the rest of the band structure equivalent to that of gray tin or mercury telluride as well , the resulting insulating ground state , at least at the mean - field level , would be topologically nontrivial  @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be a precious example of a _ topological _ mott insulator  @xcite .    in order to remove the abrikosov s nfl fixed point ,",
    "however , the existence of which is guaranteed close to four spatial dimensions , from the physical real - valued space of couplings , it is necessary to have a qc point that would collide with it with the change of some parameter .",
    "indeed , in a certain large-@xmath2 extension of the theory one can show that such a qc point does exist  @xcite . at the physical value of @xmath3 , however , in the purely fermionic formulation of the problem",
    "the putative qc point lies at strong values of the short - range couplings in the relevant dimensions @xmath4 .",
    "one may therefore question whether such a qc point is a genuine feature of the theory , and if it would , for example , survive if one went beyond the one - loop approximation . as we will see such reservations would not be entirely without grounds .",
    "similar issue arises in the interacting system of linearly dispersing dirac fermions  @xcite . in this case , however , an alternative partially bosonized gross - neveu - yukawa formulation can be devised  @xcite . in this reformulation of the theory",
    "one finds a clearly identifiable upper critical dimension , which can be used to control the quantum critical point and compute its characteristics in perturbative fashion .",
    "the crucial ingredient , however , behind this fortunate outcome is the linearity of the dirac quasiparticle spectrum , which allows the lorentz symmetry , although absent at the level of the lattice hamiltonian , to _ emerge _ dynamically at the qc point . in the systems with the qbt , on the other hand ,",
    "such an enlarged symmetry is certainly not expected at low energies , and it is _ a priori _ not even clear what dynamic scaling to assume , as the coupled fermion - boson system on the gaussian level appears to be characterized by two different dynamical critical exponents , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , as already implicit in  @xcite and as will be discussed here at length , one readily finds that the minimal hamiltonian with the qbt point in 3d requires the use of the maximal set of _ five _ four - dimensional mutually anticommuting dirac matrices .",
    "this is not an accident , and the situation is the same in 4d , except that one there needs the maximal set of nine sixteen - dimensional dirac matrices .",
    "having no further anticommuting matrix left prohibits then the opening of an isotropic mass - gap in the insulating state , which is usually preferred in the systems with dirac fermions  @xcite .",
    "this leaves as the energetically next - best option the dynamical generation of the second - rank tensorial order parameter , which breaks the rotational and preserves the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "nematic _ order parameter , as well known from the studies of liquid crystals  @xcite , allows a cubic rotationally - invariant term , which is typically responsible for a discontinuous transition .",
    "this makes the existence of the qc point in this system seem additionally questionable .",
    "given these difficulties which appear to be inherent to the problem at hand , it is quite remarkable that together they conspire to allow the construction of the gross - neveu - yukawa type of field theory for the nematic transition in the system with qbt that _ has _ a perturbatively accessible qc point .",
    "we find that it is precisely the presence of the cubic invariant for the nematic order parameter that implies the existence of the upper critical dimension in the theory .",
    "the dichotomy in the dynamical scaling of fermions and bosons at the gaussian fixed point of the theory is naturally resolved at the qc point , with the critical behavior becoming independent of the specific choice of the scaling scheme , and ultimately characterized by a single dynamical critical exponent @xmath7 .",
    "the nematic quantum phase transition from the semimetallic phase into the insulating phase with the anisotropic gap described by the above qc point is therefore presumably _ continuous _ , at least at the level of the mean - field theory  in contrast to the classical thermal isotropic - to - nematic transition in liquid crystals  @xcite . to the leading order ,",
    "the qc point is characterized by the dynamical critical exponent @xmath8 , a nontrivial positive anomalous dimension of the order - parameter field , and a vanishing anomalous dimension for the fermions .",
    "the relative signs of the cubic - term and the yukawa couplings at the critical point are also such that the state with fully gapped fermions is favored in the ordered phase , as one would expect from energetics  @xcite .    for the sake of simplicity , in the present work",
    "we neglect the effects of the unscreened long - range tail of the coulomb interaction .",
    "while our predictions for the critical exponents near the upper critical dimension may be subject to quantitative improvement upon its inclusion , possibly already at the leading order in the @xmath9  expansion , we see no reason why the mechanisms responsible for the _ existence _ of the nematic qc point should be qualitatively altered when the long - range coulomb interaction is included  as long as @xmath9 is small . for larger values of @xmath9 , in contrast , according to the scenario of the `` fixed - point collision ''  @xcite , the qbt system with the long - range interaction should become unstable towards an insulating ground state with an anisotropic gap . with the inclusion of the long - range interactions the expansion around the upper critical dimension is thus expected to , even qualitatively , eventually break down at some _ lower _ critical dimension , which may as well lie above the physical three  @xcite . rather than deriving quantitative predictions for experimental systems ,",
    "our limited objective here is thus to further substantiate the mechanism of  fixed - point collision \" , by establishing the very existence of the nematic critical point beyond the previous large-@xmath2 approximation .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the construction of the minimal isotropic qbt hamiltonian in the form that most closely resembles the dirac hamiltonian , in general spatial dimension . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gny - field - theory ] the gross - neveu - yukawa continuum field theory for the nematic order parameter coupled to fermions is presented .",
    "we present the mean - field theory for the nematic quantum phase transition and discuss its order and the nature of the associated interacting ground state in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf - theory ] .",
    "the structure of the renormalization group and the concomitant quantum critical point are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg - flow ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : interpretation ] we offer an interpretation of our results .",
    "concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "some nontrivial technical points necessary for the calculation are presented in five appendices .",
    "we first discuss the construction of the minimal , rotationally invariant and particle - hole symmetric qbt hamiltonian , in general spatial dimension @xmath10 .",
    "we assume that in the momentum representation it has the form of @xmath11 with @xmath12 as the matrix coefficients , which need to be determined .",
    "obviously , @xmath12 must transform as the components of a second - rank symmetric tensor under rotations . for simplicity",
    ", we set the effective band mass to @xmath13 and demand that @xmath14 , with the minimal dimension of the hamiltonian to be determined .",
    "@xmath15 thus contains only even powers of the momentum s components @xmath16 , and the matrix coefficients must then satisfy the anticommutation rules @xmath17 where @xmath18 is any of the diagonal elements @xmath19 , @xmath20 is any of the off - diagonal element @xmath12 with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 if we normalize the diagonal elements so that all @xmath24 , @xmath25 provided that the following condition is satisfied : @xmath26 demanding further that the tensor @xmath12 is traceless , the hamiltonian @xmath27 would contain only the irreducible tensor @xmath28 , and would be without the scalar term @xmath29 .",
    "the existence of such a scalar part would only introduce different curvatures of the upper and the lower branches of the energy spectrum , and we omit it for the time being . we therefore set @xmath30 with the spectrum being quadratic , isotropic , and particle - hole symmetric , @xmath31 .",
    "tracelessness , however , implies that , for arbitrary index @xmath32 , @xmath33 or , in other words that for any pair of diagonal elements @xmath34 when combined with eq .",
    "this in particular implies that off - diagonal elements are to be normalized as @xmath35 .    to construct the desired hamiltonian @xmath27 we therefore need @xmath36 mutually anticommuting dirac matrices , for the off - diagonal ( first ) and the diagonal ( second term ) elements .",
    "out of @xmath37 dirac matrices for the diagonal matrices , @xmath10 matrices @xmath19 that satisfy eq .   and",
    "square to unity can always be constructed .",
    "for example :    \\(1 ) in @xmath38 only two anticommuting matrices are needed , and therefore may be chosen as @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .",
    "the hamiltonian describes the band touching point in bilayer graphene , for example .",
    "note that @xmath27 is time - reversal symmetric , and the time - reversal operator is @xmath41 , the complex conjugation alone . since @xmath42 this hamiltonian can arise as a low - energy limit of a lattice hamiltonian with spinless fermions hopping between sites  @xcite .",
    "examples of such lattice hamiltonians already exist in the literature  @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) in @xmath1 one needs _",
    "five _ dirac matrices for the construction , so their minimal dimension is four .",
    "we can choose @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and then for the diagonal elements @xmath46 the hermitian dirac matrices @xmath47 , @xmath48 satisfy the clifford algebra @xmath49 . with this particular choice",
    "the hamiltonian can also be rewritten as @xmath50 with @xmath51 are proportional to five real spherical harmonics for the angular momentum of _ two _ ; explicitly , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , with @xmath55 and @xmath56 as the spherical angles in the momentum space .",
    "note that among the five four - dimensional dirac matrices we can always choose two ( say @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) as imaginary and the remaining three as real , so @xmath27 is also time - reversal invariant , but now with ( unique ) @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , @xmath60 , and in three dimensions @xmath27 inevitably describes particles with half - integer spin .",
    "in fact this ",
    "luttinger hamiltonian \" is well known to arise from the spin - orbit coupling in gapless semiconductors such as gray tin , for example  @xcite , also , the kramers theorem applies in this case and dictates that the spectrum is doubly degenerate at any momentum .",
    "\\(3 ) for completeness , let us also display the solution for @xmath0 .",
    "for the off - diagonal elements we now need six mutually anticommuting matrices , and for the diagonal elements three more .",
    "the nine - component clifford algebra has the unique irreducible representation being sixteen - dimensional .",
    "we may then choose the off - diagonal elements as @xmath61 , and the diagonal elements as @xmath62 displaying @xmath27 in the form equivalent to eq .   would define the four - dimensional generalization of the @xmath63 spherical harmonics .",
    "note also that among the nine sixteen - dimensional dirac matrices , four ( say with indices @xmath64 ) can be chosen to be purely imaginary , with the remaining five then as real  @xcite .",
    "the time - reversal operator that commutes with @xmath27 exists , and is unique : @xmath65 , but again @xmath66 , and the minimal hamiltonian in @xmath0 , similarly to @xmath38 describes a spinless particle .",
    "the solutions to the above conditions for the matrices @xmath12 can be found in all dimensions , with the properties of the minimal hamiltonian under time reversal , for example , being strongly dimension dependent , as our examples already illustrate .",
    "further details on the construction of the @xmath10-dimensional qbt hamiltonian are provided in appendix  [ app : qbt - general ] .",
    "the construction can also be generalized to higher - order band touching , which would involve the higher - rank tensors and higher - angular - momentum spherical harmonics .",
    "further elaboration of this point would be somewhat tangential to our main subject , and we leave it for another occasion .",
    "we consider next the qbt fermions in @xmath1 and at @xmath67 .",
    "the system may possibly harbor several qc fixed points which for large enough short - range interactions could lead to various different instabilities and corresponding symmetry breaking patterns , in analogy to the 2d dirac system describing interacting fermions on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite . due to the vanishing density of states at the qbt point in 3d",
    "any such qc point will be located at strong coupling  as long as the long - range tail of coulomb interaction is suppressed . with the long - range interaction included , however , the critical coupling is expected to decrease significantly , and might even vanish completely  @xcite , in contrast to the dirac systems .",
    "we have shown recently  @xcite , that in the isotropic and particle - hole symmetric case the long - range interaction favors the nematic instability , and if indeed the qbt point becomes unstable at low temperatures , the rotational symmetry would break spontaneously . to substantiate this scenario and to understand to concomitant ordering , in the present work we therefore focus on the nematic interaction channel .    in order to establish the existence of a nematic qc point and to discuss its characteristics",
    ", we will suppress in what follows the long - range part of the coulomb interaction . in the vicinity of the upper critical dimension",
    ", its inclusion is expected to only _",
    "quantitatively _ improve our numerical predictions .",
    "away from the upper critical dimension , however , the situation may , according to the scenario of the `` fixed - point collision ''  @xcite , dramatically change , and we will briefly comment on this in the conclusions .",
    "the continuum quantum action , coupled to the fluctuating nematic order parameter then is @xmath68 , with the lagrangian density @xmath69 and with the individual terms defined as @xmath70 @xmath71 is the four - component grassmann field , whereas @xmath72 is a real field .",
    "the summation over the repeated indices is now assumed , and @xmath48 , and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath47 are the five mutually anticommuting four - dimensional dirac matrices introduced earlier .",
    "the real , symmetric , traceless tensor field @xmath74 is defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the five real , symmetric , three - dimensional gell - mann matrices .",
    "their explicit form and important properties are discussed in appendix  [ app : gell - mann - matrices ] . since the five spherical harmonics @xmath77",
    "transform as the components of the traceless symmetric tensor of rank two under rotations , the lagrangian @xmath78 will be invariant under rotations provided that the five components of the tensor @xmath74 , @xmath72 , @xmath79 do so as well . at the level of the quantum mechanical averages @xmath80 and finding @xmath81 signals spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry .",
    "the tensor @xmath74 can be understood as the _ nematic _ order parameter , in analogy with liquid crystals , where the identical object describes the finite temperature phase transition between the isotropic and anisotropic phases  @xcite .    in the context of 2d metals ,",
    "a nematic qc point describing the @xmath63 pomeranchuk instability of fermi - liquid theory has been thoroughly investigated previously  @xcite and still commands attention  @xcite , also due to its potential role in the phase diagram of certain high - temperature superconductors  @xcite .",
    "nematic instabilities have also been predicted in 2d fermi systems with qbt  @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "however , the order parameter is odd under @xmath82 spatial rotation , which forbids a cubic term @xmath83 in the action  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the 3d system defined by eqs .   is an immediate generalization of the field theory describing the classical nematic transition in liquid crystals  @xcite , which is recovered when the fermions are decoupled , i.e. , in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "the critical point we will find shortly therefore represents possibly the simplest quantum analogue of this familiar classical nematic transition .",
    "the above form of the lagrangian @xmath78 contains the minimal number of parameters , and the imaginary time , length , and the grassmann and the real fields have been rescaled so that the coefficients in front of the first and the second terms in @xmath85 , and the second term in @xmath86 are brought to unity .",
    "besides the tuning parameter @xmath87 , this still leaves the coefficient in the first term in @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and the two interaction coupling constants : yukawa coupling @xmath90 , and the cubic term self - interaction @xmath91 .",
    "these have the engineering dimensions @xmath92= \\dim[\\lambda]= \\frac{6-z - d}{2},\\ ] ] whereas @xmath93= 2 - 2z.\\ ] ] keeping the coefficients in @xmath85 fixed demands the dynamical critical exponent to be @xmath8 at the gaussian fixed point @xmath94 .",
    "one then finds that both couplings @xmath90 and @xmath91 become relevant in the infrared _ simultaneously _ below @xmath0 .",
    "this observation allows one to formulate a perturbative approach to the problem of the infrared behavior as the expansion in the small parameter @xmath95 and search for possible non - gaussian critical points in the theory .",
    "the terms @xmath96 in @xmath86 have for this reason been omitted as irrelevant to the leading order in  @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 also is irrelevant at the gaussian fixed point when @xmath8 . at the qc fixed point , however , we will find @xmath89 to be shifted to a finite positive value , leading to nontrivial dynamical scaling of the order parameter ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : rg - flow ] ) .",
    "the rescaling procedure involves an apparent ambiguity , as one might equally well fix the coefficient @xmath89 in front of the first term in @xmath86 , @xmath97 , to unity , and let the coefficient , let us call it @xmath98 , in front of the first term in @xmath85 , @xmath99 , to flow instead .",
    "this would dictate a different dynamical exponent , @xmath100 , at the gaussian fixed point , reflecting the fact that the noninteracting system possesses two different characteristic time scales . in appendix",
    "[ app : dyn - scaling ] we show that this alternative prescription leads to an equivalent rg flow , and the _ same _ universal quantities at criticality .",
    "the qc point will thus be characterized by a single diverging time scale and a unique dynamical exponent .",
    "a similar ambiguity occurs in the effective order - parameter theory for the nematic instability in 2d metals , when the fermions have been integrated out , though its resolution differs from the present case  @xcite .",
    "we should also comment on yet another rotational invariant quadratic in @xmath74 , which is proportional to @xmath101 and that we have omitted in @xmath86 .",
    "it couples spatial rotations to internal rotations of the nematic order parameter , and is thus possible only when the dimension @xmath102 of the tensor @xmath74 ( @xmath103 ) is equal to the spatial dimension @xmath10 ( as is the case in our problem ) .",
    "we find that although of the same engineering dimension as the term we included at the noninteracting fixed point , this term develops a _ negative _ anomalous dimension to the leading order in interactions , and as such we expect it to become irrelevant at the interacting critical point ( see appendix  [ app : rg - flow - diagrams ] ) . one can analogously justify the common omission of this term in the studies of the classical isotropic - to - nematic transition in three dimensions .",
    "before we present the solution of the problem in the vicinity of the upper critical dimension , let us consider the mean - field theory in which the fluctuations of the order - parameter field @xmath72 are neglected .",
    "this approximation can be justified by adding an additional `` flavor '' index to the fermions ( e.g. , by allowing more than one qbt point at the fermi level ) and taking the limit of large flavor number @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the mean - field theory is solved by minimizing the total energy @xmath104 where @xmath105 denote the lower - branch energy eigenvalues of the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath106 in the presence of constant @xmath72 , viz .",
    ", @xmath107 @xmath108 is the uv momentum cutoff , @xmath109 . for convenience , and without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume @xmath110 .",
    "the first term in eq .   represents the energy cost of a finite @xmath72 .",
    "by contrast , the second term decreases with increasing order parameter , and thus involves the energy gain due to a ( possible ) ordering .",
    "it can be interpreted as the sum of the energies of the filled , doubly degenerate single - particle states in the ordered phase , with the fermi level at the qbt . in the present model without the long - range coulomb interaction and in @xmath1 we expect the ordered state to be energetically favorable if the parameter @xmath111 exceeds a certain strong - coupling threshold .",
    "this threshold , however , may decrease substantially upon the inclusion of the long - range part of the coulomb repulsion , and might even vanish completely  @xcite .    in the reference frame",
    "in which the tensor order parameter becomes diagonal , @xmath112 we can write @xmath113 with @xmath114 . shifting the parameter @xmath115 by @xmath116 corresponds to a cyclic permutation of the @xmath117- , @xmath118- , and @xmath7-axes .",
    "e.g. , the state @xmath119 for @xmath120 transforms into the state @xmath121 for @xmath122 by permuting @xmath123 .",
    "we may thus restrict the range of @xmath115 to @xmath124 . finding a finite @xmath125 to be energetically favorable corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of the rotational symmetry . while for generic @xmath115 no continuous part of the symmetry is left intact , for @xmath126 or @xmath127 only two generators of the @xmath128 are broken , with a residual @xmath129 symmetry resulting .",

    "likewise , in the field theory of the classical isotropic - to - nematic phase transition in liquid crystals which allows the cubic tensor invariant the leading correction to @xmath219 is also positive  @xcite .",

    "at the mean - field level , the model features a continuous ( quantum ) phase transition , described by the large-@xmath2 fixed point of the gross - neveu - yukawa field theory .",
    "it therefore seems natural to associate the identified fixed point also for @xmath3 with a continuous nematic quantum phase transition .",
    "one should note , however , that near the upper critical dimension and at small @xmath2 the parameter @xmath89 in @xmath86 becomes small at the fixed point , emphasizing the significance of purely bosonic fluctuations .",
    "the result of the mean - field theory may thus as well be overturned in the physical limit , and the possibility that at small @xmath2 the nature of the transition differs from the mean - field picture can not be excluded with certainty .",
    "we believe , nonetheless , that even in a scenario with a discontinuous quantum phase transition the above critical fixed point would still retain its physical significance : such a situation arises , for example , in the related classical ginzburg - landau - wilson theory for the ( presumably discontinuous ) thermal isotropic - to - nematic transition in liquid crystals , which also exhibits a critical fixed point in the related @xmath226 expansion  @xcite .",
    "a plausible interpretation of the latter is that it describes the disappearance of the energy barrier between the high- and low - temperature phases , and the ultimate instability of the metastable symmetric phase .",
    "an interesting feature of the identified fixed point is worth pointing out . in the reference frame where the nematic tensor would become diagonal [ eq .  ] , the bosonic part of the lagrangian for uniform order parameter @xmath227 , @xmath157 , becomes @xmath228 where we have displayed the unique symmetry - allowed quartic term as well . at intermediate steps of the rg",

    "if this remains true up to the infrared , when the @xmath231 term in @xmath86 emerges , it indicates that the interacting ground state for strong coupling has ( also for small @xmath2 ) the uniaxial form with @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "the fate of fermions in this state depends crucially then on the sign of the remaining yukawa coupling @xmath90 . if @xmath234 , the combination @xmath235 , and we recover the mean - field ground state with the spectrum of fermions having the full , anisotropic gap ( cf .",
    "[ sec : mf - theory ] ) .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath236 and @xmath237 , the spectrum has two gapless points in the vicinity of which the energy dispersion becomes linear  @xcite .",
    "we see however , that the leading term in the flow equation for @xmath91 is @xmath238 , so that a negative self - interaction @xmath91 is generated only by a _ positive _ yukawa coupling @xmath90 .",
    "this is reflected in the fixed - point location , at which the signs of the two couplings are inevitably opposite .",
    "incidentally , this feature is also responsible for the stability of the fixed point .",
    "also , even if we start the rg flow at microscopic couplings @xmath91 and @xmath90 of the same sign , we always flow to a regime in which @xmath239 , at least in the vicinity of the critical surface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rg - flow ] ) .",
    "we thus find that the consistent theory in the infrared has the fermions fully gapped in the broken symmetry phase , in agreement with the mean - field result .",
    "in sum , we constructed the field theory of the fermions with the chemical potential at the point of quadratic band touching in three spatial dimensions coupled to the second - rank tensorial nematic order parameter .",
    "we argued that this field theory has an upper critical dimension of four , and that it possesses a perturbatively accessible quantum critical point in the vicinity of four dimensions .",
