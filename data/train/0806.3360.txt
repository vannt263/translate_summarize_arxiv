    "in its original formulation @xcite , vector meson dominance ( vmd ) is an effective tree - level model based on the notion of @xmath4 conversion .",
    "when applied to e.g. electromagnetic form factors , it can roughly account for the pion form factor in the space - like region , and with some modifications , also in the time - like region around the rho - meson peak .",
    "however , for non - zero spin hadrons such as nucleons and @xmath2 , vmd is in serious disagreement with the observed @xmath5 fall - off of these form factors .",
    "this situation can hardly be remedied without a dynamical platform allowing to go beyond naive , single pole , tree - level in a systematic fashion , i.e. a renormalizable qft framework .",
    "an attempt in this direction was made long ago by incorporating radial excitations of the rho - meson into vmd , i.e. extended vmd @xcite . at the time",
    ", however , there was no known renormalizable qft to support this approach .",
    "today , we know that in the limit of an infinite number of colours , qcd is solvable leading to a hadronic spectrum consisting of an infinite number of zero - width states @xcite . unfortunately , the masses and couplings of these states remain unspecified , so that models are needed to fix these parameters . an attractive and highly economical candidate ( in terms of free parameters )",
    "is dual-@xmath1 @xcite-@xcite , * inspired * in the dual resonance model for scattering amplitudes of veneziano @xcite , the precursor of string theory .",
    "it is very important to stress the word * inspired * , as dual-@xmath1 does not share any of the unwanted features of the original veneziano model , such as lack of unitarity , unphysical particles in the spectrum , etc .",
    "in fact , in dual-@xmath1 the masses and couplings of the zero - width states are fixed so that form factors become euler beta functions , involving one single free parameter which controls their asymptotic power behaviour .",
    "this remains the only connection between dual-@xmath1 , which so far has only been applied to three - point functions , and the dual resonance model originally formulated for n - point functions ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "another aspect of dual-@xmath1 which needs to be stressed , to avoid misunderstandings , is that it is not intended to be an expansion in powers of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 is taken to be infinite from the start , as this is the limit in which qcd is solvable and leads to the hadronic spectrum mentioned above .",
    "unitarization can subsequently be performed by shifting the poles from the real axis into the second riemann sheet in the complex energy ( squared ) plane .",
    "this induces corrections to form factors of order @xmath8@xmath9 . but essentially dual-@xmath1 remains a tree - level qft improvement over vmd . +",
    "another highly attractive improvement of tree - level vmd can be achieved in the framework of the kroll - lee - zumino qft of pions and a massive ( neutral ) rho - meson @xcite . in spite of the presence in the klz lagrangian of an explicit mass term for the rho - meson ,",
    "this theory is perfectly renormalizable as long as the gauge field remains abelian @xcite .",
    "the great advantage of a renormalizable qft is the absence of free parameters .",
    "however , since in this case we are dealing with a strong coupling theory , it is essential to have a meaningful perturbative expansion .",
    "this has been shown to be the case for the pion form factor in the time - like @xcite , as well as the space - like region @xcite .",
    "this is due to the relative smallness of the @xmath3 coupling , and the large loop suppression factors .",
    "an extension of this theory to include vector meson radial excitations is certainly possible , and would establish an interesting connection with dual-@xmath1 .",
    "it would also extend the momentum transfer ( time - like ) region of validity of the calculated pion form factor .",
    "in @xmath1 , a typical form factor has the generic form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the momentum transfer squared , and the masses @xmath12 , and the couplings @xmath13 remain unspecified . in dual-@xmath14",
    "they are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a free parameter , and the string tension @xmath17 is @xmath18 , as it enters the rho - meson regge trajectory @xmath19 .",
    "the mass spectrum is chosen as @xmath20 .",
    "this simple formula correctly predicts the first few radial excitations . other , e.g. non - linear mass formulas could be used , but this hardly changes the results in the space - like region , and only affects the time - like region behaviour for very large @xmath5 . with these choices",

    "the form factor exhibits asymptotic power behaviour in the space - like region , i.e. @xmath23 from which one identifies the free parameter @xmath16 as controlling this asymptotic behaviour .",
    "notice that while each term in eq.(3 ) is of the monopole form , the result is not necessarily of this form because it involves a sum over an infinite number of states .",
    "the exception occurs for integer values of @xmath16 , which leads to a finite sum .",

    "in the case of the proton , eq.(3 ) is used for the dirac and pauli form factors , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , as these have the correct analyticity properties .",
    "once fitted to the data , the sachs form factors @xmath30 and @xmath31 follow .",
    "the fits have been made not to the raw data , but rather to the data base as corrected in @xcite .",

    "the asymptotic behaviour in the space - like region of these form factors is approximately as follows : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",

    "this is due to the fact that the neutral vector mesons are coupled only to conserved currents . at leading order in perturbation",
    "theory ( tree - level ) klz reproduces vmd predictions .",
    "however , at next - to - leading order and beyond , it provides a qft framework to systematically calculate corrections to vmd .",
    "because of renormalizability , these corrections do not involve free parameters ( the masses and couplings in the lagrangian are known from experiment ) .",
    "the one - loop level corrections due to vacuum polarization , fig.5 , have been calculated in @xcite , and those due to the vertex diagram , fig.6 , in @xcite .",

    "this is a rather intriguing feature , as it follows automatically from @xmath73 , while the gs width is a purely empirical fit formula .",
    "a very important feature of klz is that the one - loop corrections to tree - level vmd turn out to be small , in spite of klz being a strong coupling theory .",
    "this is due to the relative mildness of the @xmath3 coupling ( @xmath74 ) , and the large loop suppression factor @xmath75 .",
    "this fortunate circumstance guarantees a meaningful perturbative expansion .",
    "in this talk i have reviewed two qft frameworks in which to compute corrections to vmd results for electromagnetic form factors of hadrons .",
    "the first is dual-@xmath1 , a dual resonance model inspired realization of qcd in the limit of an infinite number of colours .",
    "this is a tree - level improvement of naive ( single rho - meson ) vmd , which incorporates an infinite number of vector meson radial excitations . due to this infinite number of states ,",
    "the form factor is no longer restricted to an asymptotic monopole type of behaviour .",
    "in fact , since the form factor becomes an euler beta function , its asymptotic behaviour is given by eq.(4 ) .",
    "this feature is essential to account for the fact that the pion form factor deviates slightly from a monopole , while the nucleon and @xmath2 form factors show a very strong deviation .",
    "dual-@xmath1 form factors involve a single free parameter in the space - like region , and at least one more in the time - like region ( after unitarization ) .",
    "the second platform is the klz renormalizable abelian gauge qft of pions and a neutral rho - meson .",
    "this allows for a systematic calculation of corrections to tree - level vmd in the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "the perturbative expansion is meaningful , in spite of the strong coupling nature of the theory , due to the relative mildness of the @xmath3 coupling and to large loop suppression factors .",
    "an added advantage is that klz involves no free parameters on account of renormalizability .",
    "+ results from these two frameworks are in excellent agreement with experimental data for the pion , proton , and @xmath2 .",
