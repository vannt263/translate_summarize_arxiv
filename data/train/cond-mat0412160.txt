    "<S> these results were derived using high resolution transmission electron microscopy and off - axis holography measurements to characterize the agglomerates as well as the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> monte - carlo simulations were performed to model the film formation process . to this </S>",
    "<S> end the substrate - au interaction was determined using density functional calculations ( gga ) while the au - au interaction was modeled with effective many body gupta potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the film formation can be understood as diffusion and fusion of clusters of intermediate ( @xmath2 atoms ) size . </S>",
    "<S> larger clusters are more stable at room temperature and remain adsorbed on the au film . </S>"
