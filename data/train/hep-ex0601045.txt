    "a _ caveat _ is in order when discussing the extraction of information on the running of @xmath0 from bhabha scattering .",
    "the cross section of this process can be written as : @xmath18 @xmath19 naively , one could imagine inserting the measured cross section in the left - hand side of equation  [ eq : sigma ] , and incorporate the knowledge of the @xmath13-channel contributions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and of the radiative correction , @xmath22 , to extract a value for @xmath23 .",

    "figure  [ fig:3]b goes one step further , anchoring the lower end of each @xmath3 range by using the l3 measurement of @xmath55 at @xmath58 and assuming it also describes the running of @xmath0 for lower values of @xmath3 .",
    "first , the l3 measurement at @xmath25 and the opal measurement at @xmath1 are combined in a single measurement : @xmath59 . the value of @xmath60 is then fixed by using the measured value of @xmath55 from equation  [ eq : c ] , the evolution expected from equation  [ eq : runc ] and the qed description of @xmath56 of reference  @xcite . finally , the value of @xmath61 is extracted by using the fixed value of @xmath60 , with an additional uncertainty which follows from the 14% uncertainty on @xmath55 .",
