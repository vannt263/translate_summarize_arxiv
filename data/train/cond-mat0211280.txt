    "the cohesive properties of a particle contact depend on the temperature , in so far that a melted contact should have weak tensile and compressive strength .",

    "various authors have used this idea and numerous variants were implemented , see @xcite for a summary and discussion .",
    "since we combine cohesion and friction and introduce time and temperature dependencies , it is convenient to repeat the model and define the implementation .",
    "the tangential force is coupled to the normal force via coulomb s law , i.e.  @xmath125 , where for the limit case one has sliding friction and for the case of small forces @xmath126 , one has static coulomb friction .",
    "the latter situation requires an elastic spring in order to allow for a restoring force and a non - zero remaining tangential force in static equilibrium due to activated coulomb friction .    as a consequence of the cohesion force in normal direction , attractive forces are possible so that coulomb s law has to be modified @xmath127 with the minimum ( maximum attractive ) force @xmath128 the equal @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ftc0 ] ) corresponds to ( fully ) activated , sliding friction , while the smaller @xmath130 corresponds to static friction .",

    "this can lead to a stable equilibrium of the solid also at @xmath134 and activated tangential static friction .",

    "next , the tangential velocity is computed @xmath138 with the total relative velocity @xmath139 in the next step we calculate the tangential test - force as the sum of the tangential spring and a tangential viscous force ( similar to the normal viscous force ) @xmath140 with the tangential spring stiffness @xmath141 , with a typical stiffness ratio @xmath142 , see @xcite , and the tangential dissipation parameter @xmath143 . if @xmath144 , with @xmath145 , one has static friction and , on the other hand , if @xmath146 , sliding friction is active . in the former case ,",

    "furthermore , we remark that the cohesion could also be coupled to friction in the sense that a broken contact looses its tensile strength when it is assumed brittle , so that @xmath157 , i.e.  if one has a sliding contact with @xmath158 . would not be affected by the type of the contact being either sliding or sticking . in this study we assume , as an arbitrary , possibly inconsistent choice , @xmath159 , thus disregarding cohesion in the sliding situation .",
    "the effect of this choice has to be examined in more detailed elsewhere . ]      in parallel to the change of normal stiffness , the tangential stiffness is always kept in a constant ratio to @xmath39 so that @xmath160 since the stiffness in tangential direction is based on the same arguments as the material stiffness in normal direction .",
    "the friction is coupled to the temperature dependent value of the stiffness @xmath109 , because friction should not be present in a liquid at large enough temperatures , so that @xmath161 thus friction is modified together with the changes in normal direction .",

    "up to the beginning of the sintering process all densities are equal due to an identical preparation of the sample . for increasing duration of sintering , @xmath177 ,",
    "the density successivly increases with @xmath177 .",
    "this effect is strongest at the beginning , but continues also for longer times .",
    "below , we will discuss different reasons for this increase in density in more detail . at the end of the sintering process ,",
    "the system is cooled down , corresponding to the final , small increase in density , and then relaxes to the final configuration .      as a control simulation , also",
    "three particles were simulation and sintered in the same way as the larger samples with @xmath192 and @xmath189 above .",
    "a sample with only three particles has almost no possibility for a rearrangement after the initial load is applied ( actually , the three particles were either arranged on a triangle or on a line and did not change their configuration for the cases observed ) .",
    "this artificial test - case shows that the strong increase in density observed for larger samples is caused by re - arrangements of the packing and not only due to the force model .",
    "more quantitatively , the sintering process leads to a densification of about 5% and 16% for @xmath171 and @xmath168 , respectively , whereas the densification due to the contact law , without rearrangements of the packing , can be estimated to the respective magnitudes of about 0.2% and 8% ( data not shown here ) .",
    "thus , for low confining pressure , reorganizations are much more important than in the case of large external pressure  at least for the parameters used here . in this spirit ,",
    "network - models or dem simulations with fixed arrangements @xcite can not account for the reorganization of the packing , which is of eminent importance during the sintering process .    another control simulation without thermal expansion of the particles , @xmath193 , gave no new insights and did not change the outcome of the simulations after cool - down , even though the values of the density were slightly different from the values obtained with a thermal expansion . therefore , we conclude that the qualitative results are not dependent on detailled parameter values and the sintering behavior , macroscopic as well as microscopic , is generic within the framework of this model .      in summary",
    ", we obtain that longer sintering and larger confining pressures lead to higher densities of the sintered sample . as an example , after the end of the longest sintering process ( dashed line ) at @xmath194 , a density of almost @xmath195 is reached for @xmath168 . only after cool - down , the maximum density of almost @xmath196 is reached due to negative thermal expansion .    through test simulations with different parameters",
    ", we verified that the increase in density is only partially due to the contact model , but also is caused by reorganizations in the sample .",
    "the thermal expansion of the particles , on the other hand , does not affect the results in a drastic way .      in order to understand the behavior of the material during sintering",
    ", we take a look at some microscopic quantities of the system , like the coordination number , in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont1 ] .",
    "we note two major issues : first , the larger confining stress , @xmath168 , leads to a larger number of contacts per particle , whereas the samples with small confining stress , @xmath171 , approach a coordination number of @xmath197 , as can be expected for a frictionless , isostatic arrangement of disks .",
    "second , the coordination number sometimes decays , whereas the density continuously increases .",
    "we attribute this to the fact , that inside the sample , reorganizations can take place , which save space and thus increase the density , but at the same time can lead to a smaller @xmath198 .    in order to deepen this insight , the coordination number",
    ", the density and the measured wall - stress @xmath199 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cont2 ] . the continuous increase in density",
    "is sometimes accompanied by a decrease of the coordination number and large stress fluctuations .",
    "large scale re - organizations of the packing thus may be responsible for a detectable fluctuation of the stress at the boundaries of the sample , possibly connected to sound emission .",
    "a very specific microscopic property of the sintered sample is the statistics of the contacts , i.e.  the probability distribution function ( pdf ) to find a certain overlap @xmath12 .",
    "after the initial preparation of the powder sample at low temperature , the probability for larger overlaps decays rapidly  no large deformations have taken place .",
    "the overlap probabilities at the final stage of the sintering process are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap3 ] for @xmath189 , and both side pressures @xmath171 and @xmath168 .",
    "the probability distributions show many contacts with small overlaps and a rapidly decaying probability for large overlaps at short sintering times .",
    "the mean overlap increases , as expected , with the side stress and the sintering time .",
    "the larger side stress leads to an underpopulation of small overlaps , because _ all _ particles are compressed quite strongly .",
    "the probability distributions after the cool - down and the subsequent relaxation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap5 ] for the same simulations .",
    "the remarkable difference is not the width of the distribution  that is only slightly wider .",
    "the most striking difference is the shape , showing that after cool - down contacts with small overlap are rarefied , while contacts with a the typical overlap are overpopulated as compared to the situation before cool - down .",
    "the probability for the largest overlaps is still decreasing rapidly .      due to the advanced contact force law ,",
    "as introduced and used in this stude , it is not possible to directly obtain the contact force from the overlap .",
    "therefore , the pdf for the normal contact forces is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : force10 ] and [ fig : force100 ] for small and large side - stresses @xmath171 and @xmath168 , respectively , and for different sintering times , @xmath177 as given in the inset .",
    "comparing the pdf for the two situations , after sintering and after cool - down , the astonishing outcome of the simulation is the fact that the contact forces are mostly repulsive and rather small in the hot situation , just before cool - down .",
    "this situation changes during cooling down : the cooling goes ahead with a broadening of the distribution towards both positive and negative forces .",
    "this qualitative result is independent of the side pressure , however , the width of the distribution increases with increasing side stress and increasing sintering time .",
    "another interesing and unexpected result is the observation that the force distribution",
    "_ becomes narrower _ with sintering .",
    "in other words , the extremely large forces are `` destroyed '' due to long time sintering and the distribution becomes more homogeneous in the sense that its width becomes smaller , see top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : force100 ] .      from the tangential force distribution ( data not shown ) , there are less clear observations to be made .",
    "the force distribution shows that during sintering the tangential forces become weaker  as can be expected from the force model , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) , since @xmath109 decays with increasing temperature and time .",
    "thus longer sintering leads to weaker tangential forces .",
    "however , after cool - down , the tangential force distribution is almost independent of the side stress and the sintering time , if both are sufficiently large .",
    "with other words , only for very small side stresses and sintering times , the tangential forces are weakly activated , for larger @xmath165 or @xmath177 , the tangential forces reach a saturation distribution that is decaying almost exponentially for large @xmath200 .",
    "the second possibility to look at the tangential forces is to measure the amount of friction that is activated , namely @xmath201 .",
    "this quantity should not become larger than @xmath202 , as is consistently observed from the data .",
    "contacts where @xmath203 are referred to as contacts with fully activated friction .",
    "these become less probable for longer sintering times since , as mentioned before , the attractive forces become stronger after long sintering and the cooling down .",
    "larger attractive forces correspond to a larger magnitude of @xmath131 , so that @xmath204 becomes smaller .",
    "the samples prepared via the procedure described above are now tested via two test experiments , a compression test , where the vertical confining pressure is slowly increased , and a vibration test , where the confining stress is removed , and the sample is vibrated vertically on a flat bottom .",
    "the compression test is performed for two sample sizes , namely with @xmath192 and @xmath189 , in order to judge the effect of a rather small particle number on the outcome of the simulations .",
    "the compression test is a variant of the bi - axial compression frequently used in soil- or powder mechanics .",
    "a given compressive stress in one direction ( @xmath205 ) is kept constant by moving the right , vertical wall , if neccessary .",
    "the other confining stress @xmath206 is increased by moving the vertical wall down in a defined way  see also section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "this vertical motion is thus strain controlled , where the vertical strain is defined as @xmath207 , with the vertical position of the top wall @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "note that a compressive vertical strain is defined positive for convenience here .    for the compression test",
    ", the previously prepared samples are used and the top wall is displaced slowly with the vertical strain @xmath210 .",
    "the density of a sample with @xmath192 particles is plotted against the strain for various sintering times and for the two pressures @xmath171 and @xmath168 in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1nu ] .",
    "the results show again that samples , which sintered longer have a higher density .",
    "furthermore , the compressive pressure also affects the sample density in magnitude and also in the variation , i.e.  the higher compressive pressure leads to higher densities and also to a broader variation in densities between .    during compression ,",
    "the density slightly increases first and then decreases strongly .",
    "the former is due to compression , the latter is due to dilatancy that is neccessary for the material to shear .",
    "the longer the sample was sintered , the stronger is the change in density .",
    "we relate this to the existence of the attractive contact forces . for longer sintering ,",
    "stronger attraction is activated , holding together parts of the sample , so that the compression test leads to fragements with increasing size for increasing sintering duration . for the shortest sintering ,",
    "the density change due to compression is negligible and the sample fragments into single grains .",
    "the behavior of the material , as for instance its stiffness , is better described in terms of the vertical stress that the material can sustain under load , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1sxx ] . the vertical stress in the sample increases and it fails typically at some strain and at some magnitude of stress .",
    "the failure stress increases with increasing sintering time and increasing external stress .",
    "the material stiffness ( the slope in this representation ) is increased by a factor of about two when the confining stress is increased by a factor of ten .",
    "moreover , the critical strain where the material fails increases with increasing confining pressure .",
    "finally , a rather large jump in material strength is observed for sintering times between @xmath211 and @xmath212 for the small pressure , not paralleled by a similar outcome for the large stress .",
    "thus the combination of sintering time , compressive pressure and test mode appears quite non - linear and not straightforward .      for the compression test of the larger samples , also the prepared samples are used and the top wall is displaced slowly with the vertical strain . the density of a sample with @xmath189 particles is plotted against the strain for various sintering times and for the two pressures @xmath165 in fig .  [",
    "fig : s3nu ] .",
    "the results are qualitatively similar , only that the larger sample shows somewhat larger densities and a weaker decay of density after failure .",
    "the vertical stress is plotted against the strain in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3sxx ] . with increasing strain , the vertical stress in the sample increases",
    "and it fails typically at some slightly larger strain and stress as in the small sample .",
    "the failure stress increases with increasing sintering time , increasing external stress , and increasing sample size .",
    "however , the latter observation is not clearly a size - effect , since the sample size is so small that a non - negligible fraction of the particles is in contact with the walls and thus leads to different outcome .",
    "the material stiffness ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : s3sxx ] ) is again increased by about a factor of two when the confining stress is increased by a factor of ten . moreover ,",
    "the critical strain where the material fails increases with increasing confining pressure , sintering time and system size .",
    "one compression test for a long sintering time , @xmath189 and @xmath171 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:300comp10 ] . during compression",
    "( from top to bottom ) , the lines of strong attraction ( so to say the backbone of the sample ) are desctroyed and . at the same time",
    ", more and more frictional contacts occur due to local shear .",
    "moreover , gaps between the parts of the sample open and it fragments into pieces .",
    "this is only a representative example for the compression test ; a more detailed study of the fracture behavior , sample - size- and sintering - time - dependence is far from the scope of this study .",
    "the sintered samples can also be vibrated ( in the gravitational field ) in order to probe their stability .",
    "the results of the previous tests are paralleled by a vibration test , see figs.[fig : vibrate10 ] and [ fig : vibrate100 ] .",
    "short sintering times leads to unstable material samples , whereas the sample becomes more and more stable with increasing sintering time and confining pressure .",
    "the sample with the longest sintering time @xmath213 is almost perfectly stable even under strong shaking ",
    "some corner- or boundary particles sometimes break off . for shorter sintering time",
    "the sample is less stable and fragments into pieces .",
    "for very short sintering time , the sample consists of single particles only .",
    "in summary , a discrete model for the sintering of particulate materials was introduced and simple material samples were sintered for different times and confining pressures",
    ". then they were tested with respect to their anisotropic load strength : longer sintering and stronger confining pressure systematically increases the density and the strength of the material . depending on the sintering duration",
    ", either isolated particles , fragments or a single solid block of material could be produced .    besides this macroscopic point of view , also the microscopic picture was examined .",
    "the series of astonishing observations includes : ( i ) the coordination number may slightly decrease due to reorganizations while the density monotonously increases .",
    "( ii ) sintering leads to a broadening overlap distribution , but to a narrowing force distributon , and thus to a homogenization of the sample .",
    "( iii ) the normal forces become strongly attractive during the cooling down of the sample below the melting temperature . besides these facts , a lot of open questions concerning the sintering process remain , especially concerning the connection between the microscopic contact - model parameters and the macroscopic material parameters .",
    "the research to be done is an accurate testing of the model via a comparison with experimental data .",
    "since these are only available in three - dimensional systems , the 2d model presented here may be not helpful .",
    "however , the model can easily be extended to three dimensions , where ` only ' more particles are needed .",
    "note that the model presented here increases the amount of computation necessary for each contact by a large factor , so that the number of particles possible to simulate becomes rather small for a standard computer .",
    "thus an extension to three dimensions requires a proper tuning of the implementation of the force - model and possibly the view of particles as blocks of material that can not fragment , rather than isolated particles .",
    "the last missing ingredient in the model is a rolling resistance which accounts for a torque resistance of the contacts .",
