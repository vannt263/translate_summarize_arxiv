    "although type - i seesaw has been most popularly used to generate light neutrino mass , the high scale introduced through the incorporation of heavy right chiral @xmath4 singlet ( @xmath5 ) into this mechanism is beyond the reach of foreseeable collider experiments .",
    "an alternative to this scenario is to consider inverse seesaw mechanism which contains additional left chiral @xmath4 singlets field along with a low energy ( @xmath6kev ) lepton number violating mass matrix @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 neutrino mass matrix in this mechanism is written as m_&= &    0&m_d&0 + m_d^t&0&m_rs + 0&m_rs^t & +    with the choice of basis @xmath9 and after diagonalization the low energy effective neutrino mass matrix comes out as m_&= & m_d m_rs^-1 ( m_d m_rs^-1)^t + & = & ff^t[e1 ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are dirac type whereas @xmath7 is majorana type mass matrix . the key feature in this mechanism is that the matrix @xmath10 plays an analogous role to that of @xmath11 in conventional type - i seesaw . now due to the fewer number of experimental constraints",
    "a plausible approach is to minimize the number of parameters in the lagrangian , in other words to consider maximal texture zeros@xcite in the fundamental mass matrices .",
    "furthermore , to impose equality between the yukawa couplings some flavour symmetry is also needed . in the present work",
    ", we incorporate both the ideas in the context of inverse seesaw mechanism .",
    "we consider maximal zero textures along with a cyclic permutation symmetry to obtain viable neutrino mass matrix .",
    "it is to be noted that although we are not explicitly addressing the origin of such texture zero matrices however , qualitatively we can assume that this can be achieved due to some flavour symmetry .",
    "furthermore we also assume even if after breaking of cyclic symmetry the texture zeros remain intact .",
    "we adopt two different methods to incorporate the above scheme . in the first one , we consider along with maximal zero textures the matrices @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath7 are cyclic symmetry invariant by assuming explicit cyclic permutation symmetry on the neutrino fields of the lagrangian .",
    "however , since cyclic symmetry gives rise to degenerate eigenvalues@xcite it is necessary to lift the degeneracy and in the first method it is achieved through the minimal breaking of cyclic symmetry in @xmath12 matrix .",
    "however , in this scheme a large symmetry breaking parameter is needed to satiate the oscillation data irrespective of the structure of charged lepton mass matrix ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "such a choice is quite unnatural since the symmetry breaking part is comparable to the symmetry conserving part of the lagrangian .",
    "motivated by the first one , in the second method we concentrate on cyclic symmetry invariant form of the neutrino mass matrices rather going to the explicit symmetry on the fields .",
    "such a form invariance can be realized through the residual symmetry of some bigger symmetry group in the lagrangian which we do not address in the present work .",
    "we first consider @xmath12 to be cyclic permutation symmetry invariant along with arbitrary structures of @xmath11 and @xmath7 dictated by the residual symmetry and then rotate @xmath12 to bring it in a diagonal form and as a result @xmath11 and @xmath7 matrices are also redefined due to the rotation of @xmath14 and @xmath15 fields .",
    "now we demand that after the rotation of the fields @xmath11 and @xmath7 matrices are also cyclic symmetry invariant@xcite . similar to the previous case , assuming maximal texture zeros in @xmath11 and @xmath7 matrices it is possible to obtain all three non degenerate eigenvalues ( because @xmath12 is no longer symmetry invariant after diagonalization ) .",
    "as this procedure leads to a bi - maximal type mixing@xcite , therefore , to generate nonzero @xmath3 we appeal to the charged lepton mass matrix as in general it is non diagonal@xcite .",
    "the plan of the present work is as follows : section [ s2 ] contains a qualitative description of the cyclic permutation symmetry and texture zeros for two different method considered .",
    "a numerical estimation to obtain the viable parameter space satisfying the oscillation data is presented in section [ s3 ] .",
    "section [ s4 ] contains summary of the present work .",
    "we assume the following cyclic symmetry in @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields as _ el_l_l_el , _",
    "er_r_r_er , s_els_ls_ls_el .",
    "after imposition of the above cyclic permutation symmetry a general dirac and majorana type mass matrices look like m^dirac=    y_1&y_2&y_3 + y_3&y_1&y_2 + y_2&y_3&y_1    , m^majorana=    y_1&y_2&y_2 + y_2&y_1&y_2 + y_2&y_2&y_1    .now if we consider texture zeros along with the cyclic symmetry , clearly maximum number of zeros that can be accommodated within the above matrices are 6 . in table",
    "[ t1 ] all the 6 zero textures of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are presented .",
    "+     @xmath19 & @xmath20 & @xmath21 + @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 +     + since the low energy lepton number violating mass matrix @xmath7 is majorana type therefore , only one texture with 6 zeros is possible and is given as ^1=    _ 1 & 0 & 0 + 0&_1 & 0 + 0&0 & _ 1    .",
    "now , utilizing eqn.([e1 ] ) we construct @xmath25 and interestingly it is seen that along with diagonal @xmath7 any matrix presented in table [ t1 ] can not generate phenomenologically viable @xmath25 , to be precise , all the emerged mass matrices ( @xmath0 ) are diagonal .",
    "we now consider the next maximal texture zero ( 3 zero ) structure of @xmath7 given by ^2=    0&_2&_2 + _",
    "2&0&_2 + _ 2&_2&0 +    and for this choice of @xmath7 it is seen that for some combinatorial textures of the three constituent matrices we can have at least non - diagonal @xmath0 . as the emerged @xmath0 is also cyclic permutation symmetry invariant and hence leading to a degeneracy in the eigenvalues , therefore removal of the degeneracy",
    "requires a small breaking of the symmetry .",
    "now , since our philosophy is to find out a viable texture with least number of parameters , we consider minimal symmetry breaking in the different elements of @xmath12 matrix only . for a compact view we present table [ t2 ] that contains all the combinations and the corresponding neutrino mass matrices ( @xmath0 ) +    .different composition of @xmath11 and @xmath7 matrices to generate @xmath0 .",

    ". moreover the smallness of @xmath3 automatically implies that the order of @xmath26 should be of the same order of sine of the reactor mixing angle .",
    "taking into account the neutrino oscillation global fit data presented in table [ t3 ] we randomly vary @xmath26 and @xmath27 within the ranges as @xmath28 and @xmath29 and scan the parameter space .",
    "it is seen that the matrices of type @xmath30 and @xmath31 are not phenomenologically viable ( even after considering charged lepton contribution ) as far as the present neutrino oscillation data is concerned . for @xmath32 type matrix we plot in figure [ fig1 ] the variation of p vs y , @xmath26 vs @xmath33 and @xmath26 vs @xmath3 and",

    "we further adopt two different schemes to accommodate the present oscillation data . in the first approach we consider explicit cyclic permutation symmetry on the relevant fields ,",
    "however , cyclic symmetry leads to degenerate eigenvalues . to remove degeneracy in the eigenvalues we incorporate explicit symmetry breaking term in the lagrangian .",
    "it is seen that if we consider small breaking in @xmath0 , present oscillation data can not be explained and hence the first approach is discarded . in the second one , we concentrate on the form invariance of the neutrino mass matrices which can be realized through an effective residual symmetry of some bigger symmetry group in the lagrangian level which we do not address .",
    "we first assume the cyclic symmetry invariant form of @xmath12 along with the arbitrary textures of @xmath11 and @xmath7 .",

    "we then demand @xmath11 and @xmath7 to be cyclic symmetry invariant in the rotated basis .",
    "finally similar to the previous case we consider the maximal zero textures of @xmath11 ( 6 zeros ) and @xmath7 ( 3 zeros ) along with cyclic permutation symmetry and as a result this approach leads to a bi - maximal type mixing . as the charged lepton mass matrix",
    "is not diagonal in general and moreover as our philosophy is to minimize the number of parameters we consider three simplified structures of @xmath13 along with texture zeros and therefore , nonzero @xmath3 is generated through the contribution of charged lepton sector .",
    "it is shown that in this case all the oscillation data can be generated within the @xmath64 range and the model predicts a highly constrained ranges of cp violating phases along with an inverted hierarchical spectrum of the neutrino masses .",
