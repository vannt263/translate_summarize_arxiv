    "[ flat1 ] we demonstrate the distribution of only the flat band states against varying magnetic flux for open - ended ( fig .  [ flat1](a ) ) and closed - loop ( fig .",
    "[ flat1](b ) ) berker - diamond arrays .",
    "the figure brings out the interesting contrast between the two lattices .",
    "the fbs for the    open ended berker geometry are grossly divided into two segments above and below the non - dispersive state at @xmath103 .",
    "the subgroups of such states touch each other at @xmath84 , mimicking a dirac cone . on the other hand the fbs for the closed loop diamond hierarchical array exhibit global gaps along the energy axis as well as for changing values of the magnetic flux .",
    "the edge states in both the cases are seen to be most affected by the magnetic field , which is likely to lower the persistent current for such energy regimes .    before ending this section , it is pertinent to comment that , in all the cases discussed so far , the amplitudes of the fbs are confined within a single unit cell of the lattice under consideration .",
    "such states thus belong to the @xmath104 class of fbs as per the nomenclature introduced by danieli _",
    "et al . _",
    "however , the rule of constructing the distribution of amplitudes , as shown as an example in fig .  [ berker](b ) can be implemented for any arbitrarily large generation of the lattice .",
    "this is simple , as any large lattice can be renormalized precisely to the one displayed in fig .",
    "[ berker](b ) . we need to fix the amplitudes of the flat band wave function to the values @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 on the appropriate vertices of the renormalized lattice , exactly in the way depicted in fig .",
    "[ flat1 ] .",
    "one can then easily work in the backward direction to extract the distribution in the bare scale of length  @xcite .",
    "the analyses presented in the previous sections lead to an interesting prospect . the effective mass of an electron travelling in these kinds of    arrays can be controlled by tuning the external magnetic field in a non - trivial fashion .",
    "this result is a generic feature of an array of diamond network , and is thus common to the fibonacci - diamond and berker - diamond class .",
    "the microscopic variations are , of course sensitive to the specific aperiodic geometry one introduces along the arm of a diamond .",
    "we explain the basics with the help of the simplest model of a diamond array , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ ladder ] , but now without the diagonal hopping @xmath108 .",
    "a uniform magnetic flux @xmath109 pierces every plaquette .",
    "such a geometry can easily be mapped on to an effectively linear chain , such as depicted in fig .",
    "[ ladder](c ) .",
    "the renormalized on - site potentials and nearest neighbor hopping integrals on this chain , with @xmath110 are given by , @xmath111 the dispersive bands are given by , @xmath112 before presenting the variation of the effective mass with flux , it is essential to remind ourselves that , as an electron travels around a trapped magnetic flux , the wave function picks up a phase , viz . , @xmath113 , the line integral in the exponent being the flux trapped in the closed loop .",
    "the magnetic flux here plays a role equivalent to the wave vector  @xcite .",
    "one can thus conceive of a @xmath114 diagram which is equivalent to a typical @xmath115 diagram for electrons travelling in a two dimensional periodic lattice .",
    "the  brillouin zone \" equivalents are expected to show up , across which variations of the group velocity and the effective mass will take place .",
    "this is precisely the situation as depicted in fig .",
    "[ group1 ] .",
    "every contour displayed corresponds to a fixed value of the group velocity which exhibits a period equal to @xmath116 .",
    "the red lines are the equivalents of the brillouin zone boundaries across which the group velocity flips its sign if one moves parallel to the @xmath109-axis at a fixed value of @xmath1 , or vice versa .",
    "this implies that , one can , in principle , make an electron _ retard _ without changing its energy by tuning the external flux alone .",
    "the group velocity is exactly zero along the red lines , showing that the eigenfunctions are self - localized around finite clusters of sites , making the electronic state a non - dispersive , flat one , as we discussed in the beginning .",
    "however , a more serious issue crops up as we note that the same numerical value of the group velocity may lead to a positive , or a negative effective mass of the electron depending on the curvature of the dispersive band at those particular values of the group velocity .",
    "this is not apparent from the @xmath114 diagram in fig .",
    "[ group1 ] , but becomes explicit if we look at the expression of the effective mass which is given by , @xmath117^{3/2 } } \\right ] } \\label{mass}\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ effmass ] we display the variation of the effective mass against    a changing magnetic field ( flux ) for different values of the wave vector @xmath1 . for @xmath118 , the effective mass displays a _",
    "re - entrant _ behavior , going from a negative value below @xmath119 to a positive value above the half flux quantum through a divergence shown precisely at the half flux quantum .",
    "the exception to this general character takes place at @xmath120 , which is the first quarter of the band .",
    "the effective mass remains negative for all values of the magnetic flux , diverging at @xmath121 , with @xmath122 , @xmath106 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 the divergences and crossover in the sign of the effective mass are repeated in the interval @xmath125 .",
    "the variation of @xmath126 is flux periodic with a period equal to @xmath127 .",
    "this discussion points to the obvious implication that the electron - lattice interaction can be tuned at will by controlling the magnetic flux from outside .",
    "the usual idea that the electron is made to behave like a positively charged particle in a certain part of the band where its effective mass turns negative yields , in this case , a wider variety of phenomenon where this can be achieved in a re - entrant fashion throughout the band , by tuning an external perturbation , that is , the magnetic field . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this simple aspect of such problems was not highlighted before .",
    "we have shown how to extract the eigenvalues corresponding to the localized , non - dispersive , degenerate flat band eigenstates of an infinite , periodic diamond loop array , where aperiodic structures of increasing hierarchy grow on each arm of a basic diamond network .",
    "a real space renormalization group scheme is exploited to unravel a countable infinity of such states .",
    "the grouping of the dispersive and non - dispersive bands in each case resembles the actual band structure of the quasiperiodic or fractal lattices considered here , as their generation tends to the respective thermodynamic limits .",
    "an external magnetic field is shown to be able to control the curvature of the dispersive bands , and hence the sharpness of localization . the group velocity and the effective mass of the electron",
    "are thus shown to exhibit a re - entrant behavior inside a single brillouin zone , a fact that turns out to be a consequence of the quasi - one dimensionality of the loop structure .",
    "the scheme is easily extendable to photonic , phononic of magnonic excitations , and the flat band eigenstates for an aperiodically grown superlattice can thus be worked out .",
    "this may throw new challenges to experimentalists to engineer the formation and positioning of the non - dispersive energy bands in such artificial lattices .",
    "a possible application in device technology may thus be on the cards .",

    "<S> in addition to this we show that , an appropriate tuning of the field can lead to a re - entrant behavior of the effective mass of the electron in a band , with a periodic flip in its sign .    </S>",
    "<S> geometrically frustrated lattices ( gfl ) supporting flat , dispersionless bands in their energy spectrum with macroscopically degenerate eigenstates have drawn great interest in recent times  @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initial interest in antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on frustrated lattices  @xcite-@xcite has evolved into extensive studies of the gapped flat band states to gapless chiral modes in graphenes  @xcite , in optical lattices of ultracold atoms  @xcite , waveguide arrays  @xcite , or in microcavities having exciton - polaritons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quenched kinetic energy of an electron in a flat band state ( fbs ) leads to the possibility of achieving strongly correlated electronic states , topologically ordered phases , such as the lattice versions of fractional quantum hall states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the controlled growth of artificial lattices with complications such as in the kagom class has added excitement to such studies  @xcite- @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> spinless fermions are easily trapped in flat bands  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the non - dispersive character of the energy ( @xmath0)- wave vector ( @xmath1 ) curve implies an infinite _ effective mass _ of the electron , leading to practically its _ immobility _ in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> such states are therefore strictly localized either on special sets of vertices , or in a finite cluster of atomic sites spanning finite areas of the underlying lattice . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been shown that , an infinity of such cluster - localized single particle states can be exactly constructed even in a class of deterministic fractals  @xcite . apart from its interest in direct relation to the study of gfl s </S>",
    "<S> , this work provides an example where eigenvalues corresponding to localized eigenstates in an infinite fractal geometry can be exactly evaluated , a task that is a non - trivial one if one remembers that these fractal systems are free from translational invariance of any kind .    </S>",
    "<S> in this communication we unravel and analyze groups of flat , dispersionless energy bands in some tailor made gfl s . </S>",
    "<S> the lattices display an interesting competition between long range translational order along the horizontal ( @xmath2 ) axis and an aperiodic growth in the    transverse directions . in each case </S>",
    "<S> , the skeleton is an infinite array of diamond shaped networks ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ladder](a ) ) where hierarchical structures , grown deterministically , are embedded in each arm of the diamond . a uniform magnetic flux threads each elementary plaquette , as will be illustrated in appropriate cases . </S>",
    "<S> the motivation behind the present study is two fold .    </S>",
    "<S> first , exploiting the self similar growth of the hierarchical structures we can implement a real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) scheme to evaluate the _ pinned _ , flat band states ( fbs ) exactly . in all the cases we discuss in this paper the flat band states merge with the localized eigenstates of the infinite hierarchical geometry as higher and higher generations of them are embedded in the arms of the underlying diamonds . </S>",
    "<S> thus , once again , the problem of an exact evaluation of localized states in a fractal geometry is , at least partially , solved .    </S>",
    "<S> second , and a more important aspect of the problem is to look for a possible coexistence of a multitude of dispersive and non - dispersive energy bands in a periodic array of the elementary building blocks . </S>",
    "<S> as an arm of the elementary diamond hosts a quasi - periodic or a deterministic fractal of sequentially increasing generation , the flat , dispersive bands are likely get densely packed in an environment of dispersive ones . </S>",
    "<S> the density of packing may even lead , for a large enough generation of the hierarchical structure , to a re - entrant _ dispersive to non - dispersive crossover _ in the behavior of the electrons . a recent inspiring work by danieli _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has shown that a quasiperiodically modulated flat band geometry may even allow for a precise engineering of the mobility edges .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this , we anticipate that , a variation in the strength of the magnetic field can lead to a tuning of the curvature of the energy dispersion curves . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus achieve a comprehensive control over the group velocity and effective mass of the electron with the help of an external field . knowing that , a deterministic quasiperiodic or fractal geometry normally offers a completely fragmented , cantor set - like energy spectrum , this latter study may allow us to control the effective mass of the electron using an external agent such as the magnetic field over arbitrarily small scales of the energy or , equivalently , the wave vector .    </S>",
    "<S> we present here a simple analytical method to detect the sharply localized eigenstates that are _ pinned _ on certain atoms or atomic clusters in a periodic array of diamonds . </S>",
    "<S> the non - dispersive character of such states is explicitly worked out . </S>",
    "<S> the method is then extended to unravel the entire set of such fbs when each arm of an elementary diamond hosts a quasiperiodic lattice grown according to a deterministic fibonacci sequence  @xcite , and berker  @xcite geometry . </S>",
    "<S> such aperiodic structures with sequentially increasing hierarchy are embedded in the diamond s arm . </S>",
    "<S> we indeed find that , as one gradually increases the degree of aperiodicity in the arms , the _ pinned _ fbs in such periodic approximants turn out to be the localized eigenstates of the systems in their respective thermodynamic limits .    in addition , we observe that , with a deterministic aperiodic geometry of sufficiently large generation embedded in the arms of a diamond array , the interplay of periodicity along the @xmath3-axis and the aperiodic order in the transverse directions , produces a highly complex dispersion pattern . the flat , dispersionless bands densely fill the gaps between the dispersive ones , giving rise to the possibility of a quasi - continuous crossover between them as the aperiodic components grow in hierarchy .    the magnetic field piercing the elementary plaquettes in each case </S>",
    "<S> is shown to control the group velocity of the electrons , making them more and more immobile as the flux @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the fundamental flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> this is an exemplary case of _ extreme localization _ induced by the magnetic flux as discussed by vidal and co - workers  @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is shown to flip the sign of the effective mass multiple times within a single brillouin zone - a remarkable contrast to the ordinary periodic linear lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - lattice interaction thus can be fine tuned from outside by selective choice of the flux threading a plaquette .    in what follows , </S>",
    "<S> we present our results . in section </S>",
    "<S> i we work out the basic method of analyzing the fbs in an elementary diamond array , and compare the result with the existing ones . </S>",
    "<S> section ii deals with the fibonacci - diamond chain , and in section iii we elaborately discuss the fractal - diamond networks . in section </S>",
    "<S> iv we explicitly discuss the generic diamond loop - array where a magnetic field controls the effective mass of the electron making its sign periodically flipped . in section v we draw our conclusions . </S>"
