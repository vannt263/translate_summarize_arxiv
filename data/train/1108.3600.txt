    ", they play a crucial role as they are the primary source of ionization , starting a complex chemistry which leads to hundreds molecules , and influencing the star and planet formation processes by creating ions , which in turn are coupled with the magnetic fields , this regulating gravitational collapse .",
    "there is little doubt that cr are accelerated in the expanding shocks of supernova remnants ( snrs , e.g. hillas 2005 ; caprioli et al .",
    "high energy ( @xmath9 1 gev ) cr ( mainly protons ) interact with hydrogen atoms and produce @xmath1 rays via @xmath2 decay ( hayakawa 1952 ; stecker 1971 ) . in this case",
    ", the predicted @xmath1-ray luminosity l@xmath10 is proportional to the @xmath2-decay @xmath1-ray emissivity , which depends on the local cr density , and to the irradiated molecular cloud mass ( e.g. aharonian & atoyan 1996 ) .",
    "hence , giant molecular clouds close to , or even better , penetrated by snrs can be bright @xmath1-ray sources .",
    "conversely , molecular clouds associated with bright @xmath1-ray sources can probe enhanced cr densities .",
    "several cr interaction sites have now been tentatively identifed with the latest generation of gev / tev observatories ( e.g. montmerle 2010 ) .",
    "the main difficulty remains to distinguish between emission from proton and/or bremsstrahlung or inverse compton from electrons . even in well - documented cases such as ic443 ( albert et al .",
    "2007 ) and w28 ( aharonian et al . 2008 ) snrs , the gev - tev emission mechanism remains unclear .",
    "in other cases ( in particular for w51c ; abdo et al .",
    "2009 ; feinstein et al .",
    "2009 ) @xmath2-decay appears to be the dominant @xmath1-ray emission mechanism . in these cases ,",
    "the derived local relativistic proton density is very high , typically one to two orders of magnitude higher than the average galactic cr density .",
    "such high densities should also have visible effects at lower cr energies ( @xmath11 1 gev ) , in the regime where cr ionize molecular clouds ( e.g. kamae et al .",
    "2006 ; gabici et al .",
    "2009 ; padovani et al . 2009 ; fatuzzo et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "we propose that the physical interaction between sn - accelerated energetic particles and molecular gas , where an association is suggested by the presence of a @xmath1-ray source , can be demonstrated by using the impact of low - energy cr on the cloud chemistry .",
    "the method is based on the determination of the ionization degree of the molecular cloud , which in turn gives a measure of the cr ionization rate @xmath12 ( to be compared with the `` standard '' value @xmath13 s@xmath5 for dense clouds ; glassgold & langer 1974 ) . in dense gas , the ionization can be obtained by measurements of the dco@xmath14/hco@xmath14 abundance ratio ( e.g. gulin et al . 1977 ) .",
    "briefly , hco@xmath14 and dco@xmath14 are formed by the reaction of co with h@xmath15 and h@xmath16d@xmath14 respectively : co + h@xmath15 @xmath17 hco@xmath14 + h@xmath16 and co + h@xmath16d@xmath14 @xmath17 dco@xmath14 + h@xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the dco@xmath14/hco@xmath14 ratio directly depends on the h@xmath16d@xmath14/h@xmath15 only . in molecular clouds ,",
    "cr ionize the gas by ionizing h and h@xmath16 at a rate @xmath12 and forming the molecular ion h@xmath15 , whereas h@xmath16d@xmath14 is formed by the reaction of h@xmath15 with hd . since both molecules are destroyed by the reaction with the most abundant neutral species , co , and by the recombination with electrons , the dco@xmath14/hco@xmath14 ratio is an almost direct measure of the gas ionization degree .",
    "the method has been extensively applied to derive the ionization degree of molecular clouds and dense cores .",
    "the measured values range between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , depending on the gas density , leading to estimates of @xmath12 between @xmath20 and @xmath21 s@xmath5 ( caselli et al .",
    "1998 : hereinafter cwth98 ) . finally , indriolo et al ( 2010 ) recently reported line absorption observations of h@xmath15 , measuring the ionization in the _ diffuse gas _ of the outer parts of the cloud associated with ic443 .",
    "their measurements indicate values of @xmath12 only five times larger than the average in diffuse clouds . in this letter , we report observations of the dco@xmath14/hco@xmath14 ratio towards the _ dense gas _ of a cloud interacting with the snr w51c .",
    "w51c ( also known as j1923 + 141 and g49.2 - 0.7 in the literature ) is a well known snr at a distance of @xmath22 kpc ( kundu & velusamy 1967 ) .",
    "the snr extends about 30@xmath23 ( equivalent to @xmath2460 pc ) , is about @xmath25 yrs old ( koo et al . 1995 ) and is associated with a molecular cloud , engulfed by the blast wave , whose mass is @xmath26 m@xmath27 and average density @xmath28 @xmath29 ( koo & moon 1997 ) .",
    "five hii regions lie at the border of the snr , the w51a and b star forming regions .",

    "the discussion , figure [ fig : family ] shows the structure of a 20 mag cloud whose density is @xmath70 @xmath29 , like point e , illuminated on the two sides by the is uv field and with different cr ionization rates .",
    "as found by several previous studies , for a low value of @xmath12 ( @xmath71 s@xmath5 ) and a low abundance of metals , the ionization through the cloud is governed by the uv photons penetration and depends on the abundance of carbon ( a@xmath722 mag ) and sulphur ( 2@xmath38a@xmath724 mag ) , and on the crs ionization deeper inside .",
    "the ionization at the interior of the cloud is low , @xmath73@xmath74 , in a phase called lip ( low ionization phase ) in the literature ( pineau des forts et al .",
    "this situation is represented by the case @xmath12=@xmath75 s@xmath5 in fig . [",
    "fig : family ] . in general , as @xmath12 increases the ionization in the cloud interior ( a@xmath76 mag ) increases roughly quadratically until it reaches a critical point where it abruptly jumps to high values , in a phase called hip ( high ionization phase ) .",
    "the lip / hip transition is a result of the non - linear nature of the chemical network of molecular gas ( e.g. boger & sternberg 2006 ; rollig et al .",
    "2007 ) , which have been claimed to present a bistable nature ( le bourlot et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the spatial location of this transition depends upon various control parameters , amongs which the density , the abundance of he and metals , and the cr ionization rate ( e.g. wakelam et al .",
    "2006 ) . in practice , for a cloud of a given density , the lip / hip jump is governed by the metal abundances , specifically s , si , fe and mg going inwards in the cloud , as metals are responsible for the ( non - linear ) charge exchange .",
    "as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : family ] , the zones closer to the cloud edge flip from lip to hip first , and the lip / hip jump moves further into the cloud with increasing @xmath12 , until the whole cloud is in the hip , regardless the metal abundances",
    ".    the hco@xmath14 abundance is affected by @xmath12 ( the larger the @xmath12 the larger the hco@xmath14 formation rate ) and by the presence of the hip region ( the larger the ionization degree the larger the hco@xmath14 destruction rate ) . in general",
    ", the hco@xmath14 abundance is roughly divided into three zones : in the skin of the cloud , it is very low because of the photo - dissociation by the uv photons , deeper in the cloud it increases but the high ionization in the hip region keeps the hco@xmath14 abundance low , and at still larger av it increases , when eventually the gas jumps into the lip .",
    "the ratio n(co)/n(hco@xmath14 ) of column densities , integrated over the 20 mag model cloud , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cr - constrain ] .",
    "it decreases with @xmath12 ( as the hco@xmath14 abundance increases ) , until a critical point ( at @xmath77 s@xmath5 depending on the metals abundance ) where the whole cloud is in the hip state and the hco@xmath14 abundance becomes very low all across the whole cloud .",
    "note that for high metal abundances the cloud is always in the hip state . as noted by wakelam et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the ionization distribution is bimodal with the metal abundances .",

    "2006 ; boger & sternberg 2006 ) .",
    "regardless of these details , the modeling indicates a situation where high ( hip ) and low ( lip ) ionisation must be both present , to give the observed hco@xmath14/dco@xmath14value which is an intermediate value of the two regions .",

    "this is the first time that such an high ionization degree is measured in a dense molecular cloud .",
    "the fact that this cloud coincides with a tev @xmath1-rays source close to a snr conforts the idea that it is irradiated by an enhanced flux of freshly formed low - energy cr .",
    "we have identified a location close to a cr accelerator with both enhanced low - energy cr ionization and high cr @xmath1-ray emission , suggesting novel ways to study the acceleration and the diffusion of cr close to sn shocks .",

    "therefore , a more general implication of this work is that tev sources identified with snrs interacting with molecular clouds are promising sites not only to study cr acceleration , but also to study unusual chemical conditions .",

    "<S> cosmic rays pervade the galaxy and are thought to be accelerated in supernova shocks . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of cosmic rays with dense interstellar matter has two important effects : 1 ) high energy ( @xmath0 1 gev ) protons produce @xmath1-rays by @xmath2-meson decay ; 2 ) low energy ( @xmath3 1 gev ) cosmic rays ( protons and electrons ) ionize the gas . </S>",
    "<S> we present here new observations towards a molecular cloud close to the w51c supernova remnant and associated with a recently discovered tev @xmath1-ray source . </S>",
    "<S> our observations show that the cloud ionization degree is highly enhanced , implying a cosmic ray ionization rate @xmath4 s@xmath5 , i.e. 100 times larger than the standard value in molecular clouds . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the idea that the cloud is irradiated by an enhanced flux of freshly accelerated low - energy cosmic rays . in addition , the observed high cosmic ray ionization rate leads to an instability in the chemistry of the cloud , which keeps the electron fraction high , @xmath6 , in a large fraction ( av@xmath7mag ) of the cloud and low , @xmath8 , in the interior . </S>",
    "<S> the two states have been predicted in the literature as high- and low - ionization phases ( hip and lip ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is the observational evidence of their simultaneous presence in a cloud . </S>"
