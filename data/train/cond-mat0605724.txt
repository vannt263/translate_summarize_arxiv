    "there has been much interest recently in the phenomenon of _ dimerization _ in @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnets , where pairs of neighbouring spins couple to form @xmath1 singlet dimers .",
    "the dimerization may arise due to inhomogeneous bond interactions , as in the alternating heisenberg chain ( ahc ) model , or the shastry - sutherland model in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it may emerge spontaneously , as the result of frustration @xcite : this seems to occur in the j@xmath2-j@xmath3 square lattice model at intermediate coupling values , for instance , although there is disagreement as to whether the pattern of dimerization is ordered ( ` valence bond solid ' ) @xcite or disordered ( ` valence bond liquid ' or ` resonating valence bond ' ) @xcite .    to understand the properties of dimerized phases , it is useful to construct an appropriate lattice formalism describing the dimers and their spin - triplet excitations .",
    "the physics of the system can then be connected with the properties of the elementary triplet excitations ; and one can also use the formalism to construct a continuum ` effective lagrangian ' field theory for the system at hand . such a formalism was the ` bond - operator ' representation constructed by sachdev and bhatt @xcite ( see also chubukov @xcite ) some years ago , which is analogous to the spin - wave representation traditionally used to describe the magnetically ordered phases of these systems @xcite .",
    "sachdev and bhatt @xcite considered two spins @xmath4 and @xmath5 at either end of a single bond on the lattice , forming a dimer .",
    "they introduced a singlet and three triplet boson creation operators to form the corresponding states from the vacuum :    @xmath6    then the spin operators can be represented    @xmath7 \\nonumber \\\\ s_{2\\alpha } & = & \\frac{1}{2}[-s^{\\dagger}t_{\\alpha } - t_{\\alpha}^{\\dagger}s -i\\epsilon_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma}t^{\\dagger}_{\\beta}t_{\\gamma } ] \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( where @xmath8 take values @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) , with the constraint that physical states must satisfy    @xmath11    they applied this formalism to develop a mean field theory of the frustrated square - lattice antiferromagnet .",
    "the problem with this approach is that the constraint ( [ eq3 ] ) is awkward to implement analytically .",
    "_ @xcite have applied an alternative  brueckner approach \" , in which the singlet operator is discarded , leaving only the constraint that two triplet excitations are not allowed on the same site ( bond ) .",
    "this is implemented by an infinite on - site repulsion term between triplets , which is applied using an analytic brueckner approach , valid when the density of triplets is small .",
    "the approach has been applied to the two - layer heisenberg model @xcite , the quantum spin - ladder @xcite , and the dimerized heisenberg chain with frustration @xcite , and some useful physical insights have been obtained . in particular , the occurrence of two - particle bound states formed from the elementary triplet excitations seems to be generic in these models .",
    "nevertheless , the brueckner implementation of the on - site repulsion term is also somewhat awkward to apply , and difficult to carry through in higher orders .    here",
    "we present an alternative approach in which the triplet exclusion constraint is implemented automatically by means of projection operators .",
    "we also use a  modified \" formalism , analogous to modified spin - wave theory @xcite , in which the two - body terms in the hamiltonian are diagonalized through to the highest order calculated .",
    "the absence of any constraint makes the formalism easier and more transparent to apply .",
    "the only drawback is the appearance of extra many - body interaction terms in the hamiltonian , so that carrying the calculation to high orders would require the aid of a computer .    to illustrate the formalism",

    "thus the bound - state spectral weight vanishes at the threshold points @xmath157 where the bound state merges with the continuum .    the numerically calculated results for the spectral weights are displayed in figure 12 .",
    "for the 1-particle weight , it can be seen that the corrected triplet - wave expansion matches the series estimates very well at the two lower couplings , and only begins to deviate significantly at @xmath158 .",
    "the triplet wave expansion also works surprisingly well for the 2-particle weight , which is only of order @xmath159 of the 1-particle weight .",
    "in this paper , we have developed a modified triplet - wave expansion method for dimerized spin systems , analogous to the modified spin - wave formalism @xcite for magnetically ordered systems .",
    "it differs from the earlier approaches of sachdev and bhatt @xcite and kotov _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite in that projection operators are used to confine the system to the physical subspace in the bosonic formulation , eliminating the need for a separate constraint .",
    "the two - body boson operators are also fully diagonalized through the highest order calculated .",
    "the formalism has been applied to the case of the alternating heisenberg spin chain .",
    "using perturbation theory to second order , we have calculated the ground - state energy per dimer , the dispersion relations for one - particle states and two - particle bound states , and the spectral weights for these states .",
    "it has been shown that the results reproduce the leading order terms in a dimer series expansion in powers of @xmath14 @xcite , apart from an unexplained discrepancy at order @xmath57 in the 1-particle spectral weight .",
    "the results are quantitatively accurate at small @xmath14 , but begin to show significant discrepancies from high - order series expansions at larger @xmath14 , as one would expect .",
    "the discrepancies become more serious for the more sensitive dynamical quantities such as two - particle binding energies .",
    "the inclusion of a partial set of higher - order corrections for the two - particle binding energies made things worse rather than better , as one perhaps should have expected : all terms of a similar order in @xmath14 must be included simultaneously if a good result is to be obtained .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative behaviour is correctly reproduced by the formalism .",
    "in particular , the formation of two - triplon bound states near @xmath160 in both the singlet ( @xmath1 ) and triplet ( @xmath13 ) channels , which was discovered previously @xcite is reproduced .",
    "the behaviour of the triplet bound state near the threshold where it merges with the continuum is interesting .",
    "we have seen that the bound - state dispersion curve merges at a tangent to the continuum , and that the spectral weight vanishes at the threshold .",
    "the bound - state solution does not extend into the continuum , but terminates at the threshold .",
    "this provides a neat example of the phenomenon of  quasiparticle breakdown \" discussed recently in the literature @xcite : i.e. the termination of a single - particle state where it enters the continuum for one - dimensional systems .",
    "our results appear to be more accurate and reliable at intermediate couplings @xmath14 than those of shevchenko _ et al .",
    "however , they can not match the quantitative accuracy of the high - order dimer series expansions @xcite or exact diagonalization on large lattices @xcite .",
    "the calculations could be pushed to higher orders with the aid of a computer , but it is doubtful whether this is worthwhile .",
    "the main value of a ` lattice bosonization ' approach such as this is to provide a better analytic understanding of the behaviour of the model , and a half - way house towards a continuum ` effective field theory ' for the model . for instance , we have shown how the triplon mass parameter and the ` speed of light ' can be calculated , which would be fundamental parameters of the effective field theory .",
    "it would be interesting to apply the approach to dimerized models in two dimensions .",
