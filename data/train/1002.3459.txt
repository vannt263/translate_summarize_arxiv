    "the energy dependence of the total cross section for associated strangeness production in the exclusive @xmath4 reaction near threshold has been investigated in a series of experiments undertaken at the cosy accelerator of the forschungszentrum jlich using the cosy-11 and cosy - tof detectors  @xcite .",
    "the resulting behavior can be described in terms of a three - body phase space that is influenced by a strong final state interaction ( fsi ) between the @xmath5 hyperon and the emerging proton .",
    "the situation for @xmath6 production in the analogous @xmath7 reaction is rather different since the existing data show a total cross section that varies as expected from three - body phase space , with no evidence for a strong @xmath8 fsi  @xcite .",
    "a second distinction between the production of the two hyperons in proton - proton collisions is that , at the same value of the excess energy @xmath9 close to threshold , the total cross section for @xmath10 is at least one order of magnitude less than that of @xmath4 .",
    "this probably reflects differences in the underlying reaction mechanisms as well as between the two fsi involved .    since the @xmath11 has isospin @xmath12 , extra light may be cast on both the fsi and reaction mechanism questions through the study of @xmath0 production in the @xmath13 reaction .",
    "the first measurements on this channel were completed by the cosy-11 collaboration at proton beam energies of @xmath14  gev and 1.958  gev , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath15  mev and 60  mev , by detecting the neutron in coincidence with the produced @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "the values obtained for the total cross section were strikingly high compared to those for @xmath6 production , or indeed with those for @xmath5 production , with ratios of @xmath16 at @xmath15  mev and @xmath17 at 60  mev  @xcite .",
    "such values would imply a very anomalous energy dependence , since bubble chamber data yield a ratio of @xmath18 , though at the much higher excess energy of @xmath19  mev  @xcite .    in an effort to understand the situation ,",
    "a first measurement of the @xmath13 reaction was carried out at the cosy - anke facility that did not rely on the detection of the final neutron  @xcite .",
    "this experiment at @xmath20  mev ( @xmath21  gev ) involved a three pronged approach .",
    "although the statistics were low , apart from a small @xmath22 background , the detected @xmath2 coincidences at this energy could only have come from @xmath23 , where the hyperon decays through @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this approach indicated that @xmath26 was of the order of unity at this energy .",
    "information on the @xmath23 channel could also be obtained through the measurement of @xmath3-proton correlations , where the @xmath0 shows up as a contribution in the missing - mass distribution via its decay @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "although the overall spectra are sensitive to the model used to describe the dominant @xmath29 channel , at high @xmath30 missing masses there can only be contributions from @xmath11 production . both this study and that of the inclusive @xmath3 production showed consistency with the @xmath2 determination and clearly excluded a large value of @xmath26 .",
    "these first anke results were obtained at a significantly higher excess energy than those of cosy-11",
    "@xcite and so did not rule out the possibility of a strong threshold anomaly .",
    "the aim of the present work is to extend the earlier anke methodology by making four measurements that cover the near - threshold region as well as one below the @xmath11 threshold to obtain data where the @xmath29 channel is the only source of associated strangeness production  @xcite .",
    "the beam energy range covered was from 1.775 to 2.020  gev .",
    "we start by summarizing in sec .",
    "[ data_and_models ] the existing near - threshold data on hyperon production in proton - proton collisions and their interpretation in terms of phenomenological models .",
    "the anke experimental facility used for the study of the @xmath31 reaction and the techniques involved there are described in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] .",
    "section  [ results ] presents first the results of the measurements of inclusive @xmath3 production .",
    "the comparison of these data taken just above with those from just below the @xmath11 thresholds allows us to set an upper limit on the @xmath0 production cross section at @xmath32  mev that is almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the cosy-11 result  @xcite . the @xmath30 missing - mass spectra lead to values of the total cross sections for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 production that are in agreement with the world data .",
    "the high ends of these spectra can only be populated by events arising from @xmath11 production and these allow first estimates to be made of the @xmath0 cross section as well as conservative upper limits .",
    "although the statistics here are reasonable , it is hard to quantify the systematic uncertainties and , in this respect , the most reliable determination of the @xmath0 production cross section is through the study of @xmath2 coincidences which , at the energies of this experiment , can only arise from @xmath0 decay .",
    "the values obtained from this study are completely consistent with those found from the @xmath30 coincidence data and fall below the upper bounds set by the inclusive data .",
    "the results for the total cross sections are discussed in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , where they are compared to other measurements of @xmath5 and @xmath6 production as well as those of @xmath0 .",
    "the clean determinations of the @xmath33 cross section from the @xmath2 and @xmath30 measurements give values that are more than two orders of magnitude lower than those reported in the literature through the detection of the neutron  @xcite .",
    "our conclusions and outlook for the future are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "in the low energy regime ( around @xmath34  gev ) there are three associated - strangeness production channels allowed in proton - proton collisions , viz .",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath35 , and @xmath23 .",
    "measurements of inclusive @xmath3 spectra lead to distributions where there are contributions from all three final states .",
    "there is no possibility of distinguishing between the different reaction channels without modeling the distributions from all of them  @xcite , and this can lead to severe ambiguities .",
    "the basic problem here is that the cross section for @xmath5 production well away from threshold is much larger than those for the @xmath11 close to threshold and there is no reason to believe that the associated distributions should vary like phase space .",
    "the conditions improve when two particles are detected in the final state .",
    "signals from the @xmath36 and @xmath37 reactions are usually identified through the corresponding peaks in the @xmath30 missing - mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "the physical backgrounds in such measurements are mostly connected with the decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 hyperons , which lead to a second proton in the final state ( see table  [ tab : trch ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of @xmath30 missing - mass spectra can be associated with the @xmath13 reaction channel , where the @xmath38 decay gives rise to the proton that is detected .",
    "it is important to note that the missing - mass range that is obtained using a proton from @xmath5 decay does not extend as far as that linked to @xmath11 production so that the study of the maximum missing - mass region allows one to derive values for the weighted sum of @xmath6 and @xmath0 production . nevertheless , the contributions are rather small and systematic effects can be significant near this kinematic limit .",
    "however , below the threshold for @xmath39 production ( @xmath40  gev ) , the only source of the @xmath2 correlations is @xmath0 production and this provides a much more reliable way to identify the channel than the alternative of detecting the neutron  @xcite .",
    "although the measurement of @xmath2 coincidences provides a very clean signal for the identification of the @xmath13 reaction , the statistics achievable at anke are quite low  @xcite .",
    ".characteristics of the three hyperon production channels in proton - proton collisions studied in this experiment .",
    "in addition to the threshold beam energies , also shown are the fractions of the cross sections ( br ) associated with the @xmath2 and indirect @xmath30 coincidences . [",
    "tab : trch ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : ressigplus ] shows the values of the @xmath0 production cross section extracted from both the @xmath2 and @xmath30 correlation data shown in figs .  [",
    "fig : fkpimomsp ] and [ fig : fkpmm ] , respectively . as previously remarked ,",
    "experimental difficulties at @xmath14  gev made the @xmath30 correlation data unreliable at this energy , though this had no influence on the @xmath2 measurement .",
    "the principal errors in the @xmath2 case arise mainly from the low statistics .",
    "these are much better in the @xmath30 coincidence measurement but the difficulties associated with evaluating the acceptance at the kinematic limit makes it hard to quantify the systematic errors . despite these uncertainties , the agreement between the two sets of measurements is very reassuring .",
    "upper limits on the @xmath0 production cross section are also quoted in table  [ tab : ressigplus ] .",
    "that at the lowest energy was extracted at the 98% confidence level from the comparison of the inclusive @xmath3 production data at 1.826 and 1.775  gev shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] . at the three higher energies",
    "the upper bounds were determined from the assumption that all the events above the @xmath5 limit in the @xmath30 missing - mass spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : fkpmm ] corresponded to @xmath0 production . at 1.958  gev",
    "this is about a factor of 50 below the result of the cosy-11 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it can be seen from the tables that the @xmath0 production cross sections are only a little less than those of @xmath6 but that the difference is within the error bars .",
    "( black stars ) and @xmath6 ( blue stars ) .",
    "the data points obtained in other experiments at cosy and other facilities are shown by open and closed symbols ( circles for @xmath5 and squares for @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "the lines represent parameterizations of the world data from ref .",
    "panel ( b ) : @xmath0 production .",
    "closed stars represent the current data set obtained from the @xmath2 coincidence spectra .",
    "the open star corresponds to our previous measurement  @xcite .",
    "the conservative upper limits given in table  [ tab : ressigplus ] are shown by the four short horizontal lines .",
    "the cosy-11 results  @xcite are shown by open triangles while the closed ones are taken from a compilation of higher energy data  @xcite .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to a pure phase - space variation with a normalization chosen to pass through our central energies .",
    "the solid line is a parameterization that includes a strong @xmath41 fsi and energy dependent matrix element  @xcite .",
    "the broken line is taken from the microscopic calculation of ref .",
    "[ fig : ftotcreps ] ]    the results for all three hyperons are presented in graphical form in fig .  [",
    "fig : ftotcreps ] .",
    "it is seen from this that our values of the production cross sections for both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are consistent with the world data . however , it has to be stressed once again that a large systematic error bar had to be ascribed to the @xmath5 value because of the small anke acceptance .",
    "as is well known , it is important to introduce the @xmath42 final state interaction to describe the energy dependence of the @xmath4 total cross section .",
    "on the other hand it is seen that the @xmath10 variation is much closer to phase space , though our data might give a possible hint of some small repulsive fsi .",
    "the @xmath0 production cross section in @xmath43 collisions shows no sign of any threshold enhancement of a type that could explain the large values found by the cosy-11 collaboration  @xcite and , indeed , their values are already completely excluded by the upper bounds provided by the @xmath3 inclusive and @xmath30 correlation data of figs .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] , [ fig : fdiffcr ] and [ fig : fkpmm ] .",
    "the theoretical models  @xcite whose predictions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotcreps]b were motivated by the cosy-11 data and fail completely to reproduce our results .    the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath6 production seems to lie between about a half and one , though the difference is possibly within the error bars .",
    "the energy dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotcreps]b seems a little steeper than that suggested on phase - space grounds and , if this is so , it could be an indication for a damping effect near threshold due to a @xmath44 final state interaction .",
    "there is ample evidence from the study of the threshold cusp in @xmath45  @xcite that the @xmath42 and @xmath46 channels are strongly coupled .",
    "the enhancement in the @xmath3 missing mass in the inclusive @xmath47 data at the @xmath48 threshold  @xcite is a possible sign that flux is being removed from the @xmath49 channels in this region .",
    "we have reported measurements of the @xmath33 reaction at four energies close to threshold using two techniques . instead of identifying the neutron , as was attempted at cosy-11  @xcite , the @xmath3",
    "was detected in coincidence with the @xmath50 that came from the decay of the @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "below the threshold for @xmath22 production , this decay is the only source of such correlations .",
    "the numbers of random @xmath2 coincidences were small and could be estimated from data taken below the threshold for @xmath0 production .",
    "these results were confirmed within error bars from the study of the high end of the @xmath30 missing - mass spectra , though it has to be stressed that systematic effects are harder to control in this measurement .",
    "nevertheless , conservative upper limits on @xmath0 production could be obtained by assuming that the @xmath6 events did not populate the high @xmath30 missing - mass distributions . in complete contrast to the cosy-11 results  @xcite",
    ", we found cross sections for the @xmath33 reaction to be even a little smaller than those of @xmath51 .",
    "the large cosy-11 @xmath0 production rates could also be excluded by the study of inclusive @xmath3 production  @xcite . however",
    ", this does not provide the best estimates of the @xmath52 cross section because the @xmath3 spectrum is dominated by the @xmath29 channel , unless @xmath0 production is anomalously large near threshold  @xcite . the uncertainty in the @xmath0",
    "cross section deduced from such data can not therefore be smaller than the sum of the uncertainties in the models describing @xmath5 and @xmath6 production , which is why these data only provide upper limits on @xmath0 production .",
    "the data on @xmath5 production were taken far above threshold where the acceptance of anke for the @xmath4 reaction is small .",
    "the predicted numbers of inclusive @xmath3 depend sensitively upon the variation of the production with angle and momentum .",
    "in addition to the strong distortion due the @xmath42 final state attraction , the cosy - tof data  @xcite show significant angular variation . as a consequence",
    ", one can not extract total cross sections for @xmath5 production in a model - independent way from an apparatus with a small acceptance in angle",
    ". the situation would be even more uncertain if the strong @xmath53 channel coupling  @xcite gave rise to a rapid @xmath3 momentum dependence .",
    "our aim was merely to show that , with reasonable model assumptions , we could achieve total cross sections that were not inconsistent with world data .",
    "the experimental situation regarding acceptance is far more comfortable for the @xmath35 channel in this respect because the results were obtained not far above threshold .",
    "furthermore , it is believed that the @xmath8 final state interaction is much weaker than that of the @xmath42 and our data agree with this .",
    "the resulting values of the @xmath10 cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotcreps]a are completely consistent within error bars with published data and this supports the validity of our experiment and its analysis .",
    "although the @xmath2 coincidence method leads to only small numbers of events within our acceptance , these are very clean and so the total cross sections presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : ftotcreps]b have fewer systematic uncertainties than those coming from the @xmath30 correlation data .",
    "it may therefore be interesting to note that , taken together with our 2.16  gev point  @xcite , the data seem to indicate a somewhat steeper rise than expected on the basis of phase space .",
    "this is definitely the case if the data have to join smoothly on to the bubble chamber measurements shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotcreps ] .    attractive final state interactions , such as those in the @xmath43 or @xmath42 systems , give rise to a very strong energy dependence because they can generate virtual state poles in the production amplitudes .",
    "this is not the case when there is repulsion between two final particles and so this would , in general , lead to much smaller effects .",
    "there is , however , a third type of final state interaction , namely an absorptive one where the final wave function is damped at small distances rather than being repelled . in the present case this could arise from the coupling of the @xmath46 and the @xmath42 channels , which is known to be very strong at low energies  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that flux from the @xmath54 channels is lost to feed the @xmath29 channel .",
    "if the coupled channel final state interaction is significant , it would only be relevant in the isospin @xmath55 state and this would have twice as big an effect on @xmath23 production compared to @xmath35 .",
    "it is perhaps noteworthy that the parameterization of the world data for @xmath56 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ftotcreps]a do not seem to indicate as steep a rise as for @xmath52 , though this is not the case for our own @xmath6 data .    as stressed in sec .",
    "[ data_and_models ] , there are isospin links between the amplitudes for @xmath10 , @xmath31 , and @xmath57 , but these all refer to an initial @xmath58 isospin - one state .",
    "the isospin - zero amplitude for @xmath59 is independent of these and so extra help for the modeling might be provided by measurements in this channel .",
    "this will be possible at cosy - anke through the study of quasi - free production on the deuteron with the detection of the spectator proton  @xcite .",
    "the existing theoretical models for @xmath13 production  @xcite bear no relation to our results . if the reaction were driven by the exchange of non - strange mesons exciting a @xmath60 isobar",
    "@xcite , this would strongly favor the production of the @xmath0 compared to the @xmath6 , which is in conflict with the data .",
    "it would also not contribute to the isospin - zero production of @xmath61 .",
    "further theoretical work is clearly needed to understand the full data set .",
    "+    we wish to thank the cosy team , especially d.  prasuhn and b.  lorentz for their support throughout this experiment .",
