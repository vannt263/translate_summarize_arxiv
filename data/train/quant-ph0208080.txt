    "universal quantum cloning refers to the possibility of constructing unitary transformations which approximately copy an arbitrary quantum state and hence partially alleviate the limitations of the no - cloning theorem @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "it was first achieved by buek and hillery in @xcite in which they proposed a cloning transformation which clones arbitrary states with equal fidelity @xmath1 .",
    "their pioneering work stimulated a lot of intense research in quantum cloning , a sample of which includes works on proofs of optimality @xcite , generalizations to @xmath2 cloning @xcite , cloning of @xmath3-level states @xcite , and finally experimental realization of cloning by various techniques @xcite .",
    "+ since the optimal bound of @xmath4 for fidelity was set for universal cloning , attempts were also made to go beyond this limit by cloning special subsets of states for which we have some a priori partial information .",
    "this search was indeed successful and led to the so - called phase covariant quantum cloning @xcite . for two level states , or qubits",
    ", phase covariant quantum cloning means that a certain class of states , called ( @xmath5 ) equatorial states , defined as @xmath6 which is slightly higher than optimal bound achievable for universal quantum cloning . for @xmath3-level states it means that states of the form @xmath7",
    "the crucial property of this class which allows for this higher fidelity is that all the coefficients in their expansion have equal norm . due to this property",
    "a state dependent term in the final density matrix of the clones in the cloning transformation , which is of the form @xmath8 , becomes automatically state independent ( universal ) , hence no need for making its coefficient vanish by tuning the parameters of the cloning transformation . with the automatic disappearance of this term and one more parameter at hand we find the chance to obtain higher fidelity than the optimal one",
    "this is all the technical point of the phase covariant quantum cloning .",
    "there is of course one motivation for studying these states which comes from quantum cryptography , since at least in the bb84 protocol , the states in transfer between the legitimate parties are of this form and an eavesdropper needs only to clone these kinds of states to threat the security of the communication .",
    "+ however , when we think in terms of physical properties , the partial information that we have about these states is that the @xmath0 component of their spin is zero . therefore , it is natural to ask a more general question , that is , how well we can clone a spin states @xmath9 if we know the third component of its spin @xmath10 ?",
    "this question is specially interesting for those who try to achieve optimal cloning by nmr techniques @xcite .",
    "in fact this is precisely the state of a nuclear spin which is precessing in magnetic field with a definite energy . in this sense",
    "we not only generalize the concept of phase covariant quantum cloning , but describe it in a physically and experimentally interesting context .",
    "we show that there exist a one - parameter family of cloning transformations in which by tuning the parameter one can always clone such states with higher fidelity than the optimal one .",
    "furthermore we show that within this class , the case of equatorial states give a lower fidelity of cloning compared to other states .",
    "however they are unique in the sense that they are the only states in this class which give rise to separable density matrix for the outputs copies .",
    "we also show that our consideration can be readily generalized to @xmath3-level states",
    ". + the structure of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we study the general properties of a one parameter family of cloning transformations of qubits . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we make detailed comparison between different cloning transformations , namely the universal cloning machine proposed by buek and hillery , the phase covariant cloning proposed in @xcite and the one proposed in this paper . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we briefly discuss the phase covariant cloning of @xmath11 level states @xcite in this new context .",
    "the paper ends with a conclusion .",
    "consider the following cloning transformation @xmath12 where on the left hand side we have not shown the blank state and initial state of the cloning machine and on the right hand side , the states from left to right correspond respectively to the input ( @xmath13 ) , the copy ( @xmath14 ) and the machine states ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the states @xmath16 and @xmath17 , are also orthonormal regardless of their indices .",
    "the only requirement for this transformation to be unitary is that @xmath18 and @xmath19 be related as @xmath20 consider now a general two level state , i.e. a state with a definite spin in the direction @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the polar coordinates on the unit sphere .",
    "this state has the following form in the @xmath0-basis ( @xmath24    the output state of the composite system @xmath25 is obtained by tracing out the states of the machine @xmath15 , that is    @xmath26    when acted on by the cloning machine ( [ basiccloner ] ) this state gives rise to the following density matrix for the output @xmath13 @xmath27 the new copy @xmath28 will also have the same density matrix .",
    "the fidelity of cloning defined by @xmath29 is found to be @xmath30 which after a little algebra using , the fact that @xmath31 , and the normalization condition @xmath32 , takes the form @xmath33    the last term clearly depends on the input state .",
    "all the states on the bloch sphere with the same value of @xmath34 are cloned with equal fidelity , a special subclass of these states are the so called equatorial states , those with @xmath35 .    following buek and hillery",
    "@xcite it is useful to define and calculate two distances which characterize further the quality of cloning , namely @xmath36\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which measures the degree of entanglement of the two output copies and @xmath37,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which measures the distance of the two mode output density matrix with the ideal situation of having two disentangled exact copies of the input states .",
    "the calculation of these distances are straightforward but rather lengthy .",
    "we give only the final results @xmath38 where    @xmath39    and    @xmath40",
    "until now the value of @xmath18 has been kept arbitrary .",
    "we should now fix it and hence complete definition of our cloning transformation ( [ basiccloner ] ) . in the sequel",
    ", we consider three different cases",
    ".      looking at eq .",
    "( [ basicfidelity2 ] ) , we find that universality , in the sense of buek and hillery , is achieved only be setting @xmath41 which together with normalization yields    @xmath42    here no optimization should be performed , since the demand of universality has fixed completely the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in this case the two distances @xmath44 and @xmath45 are also state independent .",
    "in fact , by inserting the above value for @xmath18 in eqs .",
    "( [ dab1final ] ) and ( [ dab2final ] ) one finds that    @xmath46      in this part we are interested in cloning only the states with @xmath47 . thus the parameter @xmath48 is free and we can fix it by maximizing the value of @xmath49 .",
    "one thus finds @xmath50 which is slightly higher than the value for universal quantum cloning .",
    "+ the distances are found to be @xmath51 although the distance @xmath52 for the equatorial states is appreciably higher than the universal value , as we will see below the equatorial states are separable when cloned phase covariantly @xcite while in universal cloning machine of buek and hillery the output states are not separable .      in this case , we fix the value of @xmath22 and find from eq .",
    "( [ basicfidelity2 ] ) that @xmath53 is extremized by two values of @xmath48 obtained from    @xmath54    it turns out that the negative sign corresponds to the maximum fidelity . inserting this value of @xmath43 in eqs .",
    "( [ basicfidelity2 ] ) , ( [ dab1final ] ) and ( [ dab2final ] ) will give us the optimal fidelity and the distances for this class of states .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .",
    "it is seen clearly that for each fixed @xmath22 , one can clone the spin state with a fidelity greater than the universal value and for most angles a higher fidelity can be obtained than for the equatorial states .",
    "if judged on the basis of the distances @xmath55 and @xmath56 , it also appears from figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] , that there are other states which are closer to a product state than the equatorial ones",

    "however , if one considers the multiple criteria of high fidelity and approximate separability then it may be concluded from all the above figures that the states with angles less than @xmath74 radians around the north and south poles can be cloned with sufficiently high ( larger than 0.9 fidelity ) and rather good separability properties .      in this section",
    "we address the question of optimality of the transformations ( [ basiccloner ] ) .",
    "the general form of these transformations are the same as the original cloning transformations found by buek and hillery @xcite and proved to be optimal for universal cloning @xcite . here",
    "we have shown that by adjusting the single parameter of these transformations , one can clone states with definite @xmath0 components of spin , with a higher than universal fidelity",
