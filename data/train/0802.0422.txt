    "the latter contribution due to spin relaxation can be either positive or negative depending on the polarization strengths , polarization directions and tunnel coupling to the different leads .",

    "<S> we study adiabatic pumping of electrons through quantum dots attached to ferromagnetic leads . </S>",
    "<S> hereby we make use of a real - time diagrammatic technique in the adiabatic limit that takes into account strong coulomb interaction in the dot . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the degree of spin polarization of electrons pumped from a ferromagnet through the dot to a nonmagnetic lead ( n - dot - f ) as well as the dependence of the pumped charge on the relative leads magnetization orientations for a spin - valve ( f - dot - f ) structure . for the former case , we find that , depending on the relative coupling strength to the leads , spin and charge can , on average , be pumped in opposite directions . for the latter case , we find an angular dependence of the pumped charge , that becomes more and more anharmonic for large spin polarization in the leads . </S>"
