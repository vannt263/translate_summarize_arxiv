    "models based on concepts of nonrenormalizable effective relativistic field theories and density functional theory provide a rich theoretical framework for studies of nuclear structure phenomena , not only in nuclei along the valley of @xmath3-stability , but also in exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values and close to the particle drip lines .",
    "a well known example of an effective theory of nuclear structure is quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) , a field theoretical framework of lorentz - covariant , meson - nucleon or point - coupling models of nuclear dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangians of qhd consist of known long - range interactions constrained by symmetries and a complete set of generic short - range interactions .",
    "the qhd framework implicitly includes vacuum effects , chiral symmetry , nucleon substructure , exchange terms , long- and short - range correlation effects .",
    "structure models based on the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approximation have been successfully employed in studies of spherical and deformed nuclei all over the periodic table  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic framework has also been applied in studies of nuclear structure phenomena in nuclei far from @xmath3- stability . in particular , in studies of isotopic chains that also included exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values , we have used the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model , which encloses a unified description of mean - field and pairing correlations .",
    "a number of interesting nuclear properties have been studied with the rhb model : the halo phenomenon in light nuclei  @xcite , properties of light neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite , the reduction of the effective single - nucleon spin - orbit potential in nuclei close to the drip - lines  @xcite , properties of neutron - rich ni and sn isotopes  @xcite , the location of the proton drip - line between from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and the phenomenon of ground - state proton radioactivity  @xcite .",
    "the details of calculated nuclear properties that can be compared with empirical data , as well as the predictions of new phenomena far from @xmath3-stability ( halo nuclei , neutron skins , suppression of shell effects in neutron rich nuclei , ground - state proton radioactivity beyond the drip - line , the onset of exotic collective modes ) , crucially depend on the choice of the effective rmf lagrangian in the @xmath6 channel , as well as on the treatment of pairing correlations .",
    "several phenomenological parameterizations of the effective lagrangian have been derived that provide a satisfactory description of nuclear properties along the @xmath3-stability line , as well as in regions far from stability .",
    "these effective interactions are characterized by a minimal set of model parameters : meson masses and meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "the most successful rmf effective interactions are purely phenomenological , with parameters adjusted to reproduce the nuclear matter equation of state and a set of global properties of spherical closed - shell nuclei . in most applications of the rhb model , in particular ,",
    "we have used the nl3 effective interaction @xcite for the rmf effective lagrangian .",
    "properties calculated with nl3 indicate that this is probably the best effective interaction so far , both for nuclei at and away from the line of @xmath7-stability .    the limitations of standard rmf effective interactions are , however , well known , even for nuclei close to the stability line .",
    "they are more pronounced in the isovector channel , which is poorly constrained by the available experimental data on ground - state properties of nuclei .",
    "for example , in a recent analysis of neutron radii in the framework of mean - field models  @xcite , it has been shown that conventional rmf models systematically overestimate the values of @xmath8 .",
    "it is well known that they also predict an equation of state of neutron matter that is very different from the standard microscopic many - body neutron matter equation of state of friedman and pandharipande  @xcite .",
    "the parameterization of the isovector channel of an effective rmf interaction is , of course , extremely important for possible extrapolations to neutron - rich or proton - rich nuclei .",
    "for example , various non - relativistic and relativistic mean - field models differ significantly in the prediction of the two - neutron separation energies of the sn isotopes with @xmath9  @xcite and , therefore , of the exact location of the drip - line .",
    "there are also differences in the predicted location of the drip - line on the proton - rich side  @xcite .",
    "the properties of effective interactions are very important for the description of phenomena in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "the choice of the effective rmf lagrangian directly determines the calculated properties of neutron stars ( radii , surface crust )  @xcite , as well as the properties of nuclei that take part in the r - process or rp - process of nucleosynthesis .    in order to overcome the limitations of standard rmf models",
    ", several solutions have been put forward .",
    "an obvious choice is to extend the minimal six - parameter rmf model by including additional interaction terms in the isoscalar , as well as in the isovector channel .",
    "the complex many - body dynamics is effectively included in additional non - linear self - interactions .",
    "this approach has been studied both in the framework of meson - exchange models  @xcite and with relativistic point - coupling models  @xcite . even though some interesting results have been obtained , especially in applications to nuclear astrophysics , the situation is not satisfactory .",
    "the problem is that the empirical data set of bulk and single - particle properties of finite nuclei can only constrain six or seven parameters in the general expansion of an effective lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "one can , of course , include interaction terms that describe specific phenomena , but their coupling parameters and even their forms can not be accurately determined in this way . in some cases",
    "even the signs of interaction terms are not determined by the data .",
    "the general expansion of an effective lagrangian in powers of the fields and their derivatives can be controlled by the ",
    "naive dimensional analysis \" ( nda )  @xcite .",
    "nda tests the coefficients of the expansion for  naturalness \" , i.e. this method controls the magnitude of the coupling constants .",
    "although nda can exclude some interaction terms because their couplings would be  unnatural \" , it can not determine the parameters of a model on a level of accuracy that is required for a quantitative analysis of nuclear structure data .    instead of including additional non - linear self - interaction terms in effective rmf lagrangians ,",
    "another possibility is to formulate an effective hadron field theory with medium dependent meson - nucleon vertices .",
    "such an approach retains the basic structure of qhd , but could be more directly related to the underlying microscopic description of nuclear interactions . in the density dependent relativistic hadron field ( ddrh ) model of refs .",
    "@xcite the medium dependence of the vertices is expressed by a functional of the baryon field operators .",
    "the meson - baryon coupling constants in nuclear matter are adjusted to the dirac - brueckner ( db ) self - energies .",
    "a lorentz - invariant functional is defined to project the nuclear matter results onto the meson - nucleon vertices of the effective ddrh model for finite nuclei . in the early version",
    "@xcite of this model , the density dependence was only included in the field equations after the variation .",
    "however , a consistent treatment of medium effects implies a variation of the vertex functionals with respect to the baryon field operators , and this results in additional rearrangement self - energies in the single - nucleon dirac equation  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the model was applied in the calculation of ground - state properties of doubly - closed shell nuclei .",
    "density dependent @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson couplings were used that were derived from db calculations using the bonn a , b , and c nucleon - nucleon potentials .",
    "it was shown that the inclusion of rearrangement self - energies is essential for a quantitative description of bulk properties and single - particle spectra .",

    "the density dependent interactions have been derived from the groningen and bonn - a nucleon - nucleon potentials . for finite nuclei , in particular ,",
    "the quality of the calculated properties are comparable with non - linear rmf models .    in ref .",
    "@xcite typel and wolter introduced a phenomenological density dependence for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson - nucleon couplings , adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and some finite nuclei .",
    "the parameters of their ddrh model were also compared with coupling constants derived from db calculations of nucleon self - energies .",
    "the model was used to study the equation of state of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and the ground state properties of semi - closed shell nuclei .",
    "even though pairing correlations were only treated in the bcs approximation , properties at the proton and neutron drip - lines were calculated .",
    "it was , however , emphasized that a more realistic description of nuclei at the drip - lines necessitates the use of the hartree - bogoliubov framework with finite range pairing interactions .",
