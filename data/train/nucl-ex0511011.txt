    "jefferson lab hks experiment aims at obtaining high resolution hypernuclear spectroscopy ( e.g. , @xmath0 kev fwhm for @xmath1b ) by @xmath2 reaction ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it utilies cebaf primary electron beam .",
    "the electroproduction provides a advantage over hadronic production mechanism because the momentum and position spread of the primary electron beam is significantly less than secondary hadron beams .",
    "the kaons are detected by high resolution kaon spectrometer ( hks ) with a momentum resolution of @xmath3 . in order to maximize hypernuclear yield ,",
    "the target is placed just before a zero degree dipole magnet ( splitter ) .",
    "the field of the splitter is used to seperate scattered e from k@xmath4 and allow the spectrometer to accept both e and k@xmath4 from very forward angles .    to calculate hypernuclear excitation energies , we need to determine scattered kaon and electron momenta and angles .",
    "the kaon momentum is the dominant factor for the final missing mass resolution . in order to obtain the proposed missing mass resolution",
    ", it is important to optimize the spectrometer optics to get the required momentum and angle reconstruction resolution .",
    "this calibration procedure is complicated for hks spectrometer because of the existence of splitter magnet right after the target .",
    ".required momentum and angle reconstruction resolution [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the spectrometer optics can be conviniently expressed in a matrix formalism ( ref.@xcite ) , which is a set of polynimial coefficients related target angles and particle momentum to focal plane measurements .",
    "conventionally , the method for calibrate matrix for angle reconstruction is by using a special designed collimator called sieve slit with a array of holes drilled onto metal template ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the sieve slit is mounted in front of the spectrometer entrance so all the particles passing through the holes will have defined incident angles .",
    "but in the setup of hks experiment , because target is inside the field of splitter , the sieve slit plate can only be mounted on the enge and hks dipole entrance after the splitter ( fig.[fig : hksoptics ] ) .",
    "the particle trajectories are already bended by the splitter field before they pass through the sieve slit holes .",
    "thus a hole of sieve slit no longer select a single , fixed angle .",
    "the usual way of angle reconstruction calibration has to be modified .    for momentum calibration , because enge , hks two arms and the beam dump line are all coupled through splitter field , thus suitable kinematics setting for typical single arm momentum calibration ( e.g. , by production of carbon excited states ) is difficult to implement .    in this paper a high precision optical calibration method for hks spectrometer is described .",
    "the procedure can be applied to optical calibration of other magnet spectrometer system with on - target magnetic field .",
    "the optical calibration procedure will use the data from enge and hks sieve slit runs for angle reconstruction calibration and ch@xmath5 target runs for momentum calibration . before the experiment",
    ", the procedure has been tested by simulation with initial optics .",
    "the simulation is carried out by using measured field map of the spectrometer magnets and tracking particles through the field by program geant ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the calibration procedure for angle , momentum",
    ", kinematics reconstruction and beam raster correction will be described from sec.1 to sec.5 seperately .",
    "the iteration of these procedure is described in sec.6 .",
    "the simulation and result of the calibration procedure from is presented in sec.7 , followed by a summary in section 8 .",
    "in hks experiment , although the splitter field smears the one to one correspondence between target angles and sieve slit hole position .",
    "the trajectory of a particle which passing through a given sieve slit hole and scattered from a point target is a functional of the paticle momentum and splitter optics .",
    "thus with known splitter optics , the scattering angle can be expressed as a function of particle momentum and sieve slit hole position .",
    "the optics of splitter can be obtained by measuring the field distribution of the magnet and tracking particles through the field by programs such as geant ( ref.@xcite ) . from the point of view of total integral of @xmath6 ,",
    "the splitter contribution is only @xmath7% , because the splitter is just used to seperate particles .",
    "the contribution of field measurement error is negligible for target angle reconstruction .",
    "based on this observation , the sieve slit(ss ) calibration procedure is :    1 .",
    "fit function @xmath8 : target angles as a function of ss hole positions and particle momentum based on splitter optics .",
    "2 .   separate events of the ss calibration run data hole by hole , thus determine corresponding ss hole center position for each event .",
    "3 .   using function @xmath8 , calculate corrected target angles ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) for each event from ss center position and momentum .",
    "4 .   fit transfer matrix from focal plane to target : ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14)@xmath15(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "a simulation of the ss calibration procedure with initial inaccurate splitter , enge optics reaches final resolution for e ( enge ) target angles ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath9 : 1.8 mr , @xmath10 : 1.1 mr , for kaon ( hks ) angles : @xmath9 : 0.4 mr , @xmath10 : 2.4 mr .",
    "the method of hks momentum calibration is making use of the known masses of @xmath17,@xmath18 hyperons and the narrow width of @xmath1b hypernuclear ground state ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the hyperons is produced from hydrogens in the ch@xmath5 foil ( 5 mm in thickness ) the momentum reconstruction matrices for enge and hks arms are optimized simultaneously by minimizing the chisquare defined as the sum of squared mass differences between the calculated mass and the pdb values .",
    "a nonlinear least square method is used to optimize the matrices for electron arm and kaon arm simutaneously .",
    "although there is emulsion measurement of @xmath1b gs binding energy at @xmath19 mev(ref.@xcite ) , the associate statistical error and the composite nature ( @xmath20/@xmath21 ) of the state may cause the peak center to deviate from this value ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "so in the calibration process , the peak position is a adjustable parameter and the calibraion is carried out in a iterative way , the gs peak center is adjusted after each iteration according to the actual fitted position of calculated @xmath1b gs distribution , until an minimum chisquare is reached .",
    "the procedure is :    1 .",
    "calculate missing mass using the existing angle matrix and the initial ( un - calibrated ) momentum matrix . from ch@xmath5 target runs ,",
    "select @xmath17,@xmath18 events , from carbon target runs , select @xmath1b gs events from a window located around the center of the missing mass peaks .",
    "+ inside the 5 mm thick ch@xmath5 target , the energy loss and radiative processes are significant .",
    "it shifts the missing mass distributions and forms a tail .",
    "the width of the event window has to be selected appropriately , because a too wide window will dilute the sample with too many radiated events while a too narrow window will cause a insufficient statistics in the fitting . 2 .",
    "define chisquare as the sum of squared mass differences @xmath22 between the calculated mass and the pdb values or the initial assumed @xmath1b gs binding energy : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the relative weight of @xmath17,@xmath25 and @xmath1b gs events .",
    "@xmath26 is a function of missing mass @xmath27 , thus a composite function of e and kaon momenta @xmath28 and @xmath29 : @xmath30 minimizing @xmath26 by by a nonlinear least square method to optimize the enge and hks momentum reconstruction matrices(ref.@xcite ) .",
    "4 .   fit the actual peak center of the calculated @xmath1b gs missing mass distribution . using this value as the new @xmath1b gs binding energy .",
    "go back to first step .",
    "iteration until an minimum chisquare is reached .",
    "the purpose of kinematics calibration is to find the offsets of beam energy , enge and hks central momentum from nominal values .",
    "the method is also to use the known masses of @xmath17,@xmath18 and @xmath1b ground state , same as momentum calibration .",
    "the @xmath26 is defined the same way as in momentum calibration .",
    "but for kinematics calibration , the @xmath26 is a function of beam energy offset @xmath31 , e central momentum offset @xmath32 and kaon momentum offset @xmath33 , corresponding to the zero order terms in the momentum matrices . at correct offsets , this @xmath26 will be minimized .    if we define sum of kinematics offsets as :    @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath26 will dominantly depend on @xmath35 .",
    "correct offsets can be found by scanning on @xmath35 over all possible values to locate the minimum chisquare .",
    "to avoid burning the ch@xmath5 target , beam will be rastered 5mm@xmath365 mm on the target by a pair of bending magnets .",
    "if the raster effect is ignored , a direct reconstruction with matrices obtained for point target gives much worse resolution , for example , the @xmath37 resolution for hks is @xmath38(rms ) without raster , it becomes @xmath39 with 5mm@xmath365 mm raster .    to do raster correction , the beam positions on target need to be determined by raster magnets x and y current event by event .",
    "for rastered beam , the reconstructed target quantities can be expressed as functions of focal plane quantities and beam positions at target .",
    "it can be written as , for example :    @xmath40    we seperated the dependence on beam positions from focal plane quantities so that the raster correction function @xmath41 depends only on beam position .",
    "it can be fitted from initial spectrometer optics . even if the actual optics of the spectrometer system may deviate from the initial optics , its effect on raster correction function @xmath41 is negligible so we can still use the initial function form ( fig.[fig : engeres_ras ] and fig.[fig : hksdp_ras ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that the individual calibration procedure mentioned above actually are correlated .",
    "for example , the calibration of target angles need the input of particle momentum while to extract missing mass , we need to know the scattering angle . thus the individual calibraion procedures should be carried out in an iterative way until convergence is reached",
    ". the general procedure will be :    1 .",
    "separate enge and hks sieve slit calibration to obtain angle reconstruction matrices using original momentum reconstruction matrix .",
    "raster correction for ch@xmath5 target data using existing raster correction matrix .",
    "3 .   kinematics calibration to find deviation of beam energy , enge and hks central momenta from their nominal values .",
    "the central angles of the spectrometers are not used in the missing mass calculation and they are not needed for fixed - angle spectrometer .",
    "two arm coupled momentum calibration to obtain momentum reconstruction matrix .",
    "5 .   after getting the calibrated momentum matrix ,",
    "go back to first step again to do ss calibration using the new momentum matrix .",
    "iterate until best resolution is reached .",
    "simulated events are used to test the calibration method .",
    "the simulation take account of target physics processes , spectrometer optics and detector resolution .",
    "the simulation of target processes is adapted from simc ( ref.@xcite ) , a physics simulation program for jefferson lab hall c basic equipment . the ionization energy loss , bremsstrahlung , multiple scattering and beam spread effects are included in the simulation .",
    "the simulation uses 5 mm thick ch@xmath5 target and 0.1 g/@xmath42 carbon target .",
    "simulated events from target are send through the spectrometers .",
    "raytrace ( ref.@xcite ) is used to simulate events in the electron arm .",
    "a measured magnet field map is used to track particles through kaon arm by geant . only optical properties ( no physical processes )",
    "are considered in this step .    at focal plane of the spectrometers ,",
