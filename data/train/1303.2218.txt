    "an extrapolation of the motion of @xmath17 back to the core suggests that it passed through the core on mjd  55850@xmath2110 .",
    "figure  [ 0716_pfmaps ] shows total and polarized intensity images of the quasar while @xmath17 emerged from the core .",
    "features @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are rather stable in distance with respect to the core , although they show scatter in position angle that exceeds the uncertainties of the modeling .",
    "@xcite found that `` stationary hot spots '' are a common characteristic of compact jets , with the majority of such features located within a range of projected distances of 1 - 3  pc from the core .",
    "these authors propose three categories of models for stationary components in supersonic jets : a ) standing recollimation shocks caused by imbalances between the pressure internal and external to the jet ; b ) sites of maximum doppler beaming where the jet points most closely to the line of sight ; and c ) stationary oblique shocks , where the jet bends abruptly .",
    "we conclude that knots @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 fall most likely in category @xmath29 , since they are quasi - stationary with an observed `` lifetime '' of several months to a year .",
    "in addition , according to numerical simulations by @xcite , when a moving knot passes through a standing recollimation shock , the components blend into a single feature and split up after the collision with no changes in proper motion of the moving knot .",
    "this scenario seems to be observed in the case of @xmath20 approaching @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ 0716_components ] ) .",
    "knot @xmath27 , however , could be a trailing component that forms behind a strong shock @xcite , since it is observed just after the appearance of the fast moving knot @xmath17 . the latter might change the internal pressure in the jet , resulting in the disappearance of knots @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see fig .  [ 0716_components ] ) .",
    "knot @xmath28 may belong to category @xmath30 , since the position angle of @xmath28 is different from that of @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ 0716_traj ] ) and the kinematics of moving knot @xmath20 changes in the vicinity of @xmath28 . in the case of a stationary feature produced at a bend in the jet , the proper motion of a moving knot approaching the stationary feature should decrease before and increase after the knot passes through the bend @xcite .",
    "such a behavior can be inferred from figure  [ 0716_components ] when knot @xmath20 approaches and recedes from knot @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray emission from s5  0716 + 71 was detected throughout the entire period of _ fermi _ observations starting in 2008 august , although most of the time at a level @xmath31 .",
    "we analyze the _ fermi _ lat data for the period of 2011 january - november with 2-day binning , as well as with 1-day binning and a 6-hour shift , during the huge @xmath1-ray outburst of 2011 october , when the flux from the source was close to @xmath32 .",
    "this prevents missing any possible short - lived events , to make the correlation analysis more robust , and to avoid the dependence of the results on the start of the time bins .",
    "we use the standard _",
    "analysis software package science tools ` v9r27p1 ` , with the instrument response function ` p7source_v6 ` , the galactic diffuse emission model ` gal_2yearp7v6_v0 ` , and the isotropic background model ` iso_p7v6source ` .",
    "the background models include all sources from the 2fgl within @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrum of s5  0716 + 71 as well as spectra of all background sources are modelled as a power - law with photon index fixed to the catalog values .",

    "we suppose , following @xcite , that most of optical photometric and polarimetric variability arises when a compact emission region ( e.g. , a shock wave ) propagates downstream from the black hole , following a spiral path .",
    "( alternatively , the jet could have a helical geometry . )",
    "we notice that prominent optical outbursts are quite often both preceded and followed by minor flares .",
    "we interpret this phenomenon as a manifestation of the oscillating doppler beaming of the emission ( lighthouse effect , see ) .",
    "the observed series of outbursts correspond to the time intervals when the viewing angle of the shock wave is at a minimum .",
    "the main parameters that determine the visible behavior of the outburst are :    * jet viewing angle @xmath35 * bulk lorentz factor @xmath36 of the shocked plasma * temporal evolution of the outburst @xmath37 ; the factor @xmath38 is responsible for different time scales of the rise and decline of the outburst ; primed quantities refer to the plasma frame * doppler time contraction in the observer s frame , @xmath39 * shocked plasma compression @xmath40 = ratio of post - shock to pre - shock density * spectral index of the emitting plasma @xmath41 * pitch angle @xmath42 of the spiral motion and helical field * period of the shock s spiral revolution in the observer s frame @xmath43 .",

    "s frame @xmath43 are connected through the relation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the source s redshift .",
    "knowledge of @xmath43 ( from the timescale of recurrence of outbursts ) , estimates of @xmath55 and @xmath35 , obtained from analysis of radio images , and evaluation of the spiral s radius @xmath56 allow us to constrain the values of @xmath52 and @xmath42 and to calculate the doppler - contracted time in the observer s frame , @xmath57 .",
    "doppler boosting of the radiation from the shocked plasma , as a discrete source , leads to @xmath58    we notice that in most cases when the source is in a quiescent state and no outburst is detected , there remains polarization at the level of @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that this is the polarized radiation of the ambient jet , presumably changing on substantially longer timescales ( except possibly for random fluctuations due to turbulence in the jet ) . in the local frame",
    "the ratio @xmath60 is of the order of a few percent .",
    "the radiation from the undisturbed jet is also subject to doppler boosting , and we ( rather arbitrarily ) set @xmath61 . since the ambient jet is a roughly steady and continuous source , its radiation is amplified by @xmath62 . notice",
    "that , in spite of the low value of @xmath63 , in the observer s frame the boosted radiation of the shock may far exceed that of the ambient jet .",
    "we add emission from the quasi - stationary features  probably standing shocks  whose fluxes become significant after the moving shock crosses them .",
    "we postulate that the temporal behavior of this added radiation is of the same form as that of the shock : @xmath64    here @xmath65 accounts for the ratio of the ambient jet to shock luminosity , with time delay @xmath66 . in our model",
    "we suppose that this radiation is added to the `` constant '' radiation of the jet , but not to its polarized part . finally , the observed radiation of the jet is @xmath67 and total observed flux @xmath68 .",
    "we consider a single variable source plus an initially constant source whose polarization vector is displaced relative to the jet direction by an angle @xmath69 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "accounting for the contribution of this `` constant '' polarized source ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , we get the absolute stokes parameters :    @xmath72    finally , the normalized stokes parameters are given by    @xmath73    figure  [ model1 ] shows the dramatically different behavior of flux and polarization with all of the above mentioned parameters fixed , allowing only the lorentz factor of the shock to change .",
    "we see that the model of a shock propagating in the helical path may in a natural way explain the successions of outbursts , often observed in blazar light curves , as a manifestation of a single event .",
    "a variety of observed patterns of photometric and polarimetric behavior may be explained by the interplay of the shock lorentz factor , jet viewing angle , helical path pitch angle , and shape and length of the outburst .",
    "we do not take into account the light travel delay caused by the finite size of the shock wave ; if included , this would result in some smoothing of the model light curve and polarization behavior .",
    "quasi - periodic flares in the light curves of blazars are expected in models of magnetically launched jets , where the plasma moves with relativistic velocities following helical paths @xcite . in light of this , it is rather surprising that numerous extensive observational campaigns have uncovered only a few cases that could be interpreted as a manifestation of a lighthouse effect from spiral relativistic motion , e.g. , ( @xmath74 , optical @xmath75 band * ? ? ?",

    "* ) ; and ao  0235 + 16 ( @xmath79 in x - rays * ? ? ?",
    "radio variability tends to occur on timescales longer than these periods .",
    "however , radio mapping provides some picturesque examples of periodic structures that correspond to longer timescales in agn jets , as in the case of ( @xmath80 years * ? ? ?",
    "as noted in , the jet might exhibit a fractal helical structure , where geometric scales that increase with distance from the central engine correspond to increasing variability timescales .",
    "recent polarimetric studies of the nucleus of @xcite have revealed strong variations of the polarization vector , synchronous with the flux variations , that can be interpreted as a manifestation of a shock propagating through a helical jet .",
    "we have obtained densely sampled optical photometric and polarimetric data during an unprecedented @xmath1-ray outburst in s5  0716 + 71 , and analyzed the changes in the structure of the blazar at 43  ghz .",
    "we find a @xmath10 rotation of the position angle of linear polarization , which occurred at the epoch of maximum optical brightness .",
    "this event would have been missed if our observations did not occur consecutively from 3 sites ( st .",
    "petersburg , crimea , arizona ) .",
    "this implies that such events may be rather common during blazar flares .",
    "figure [ model ] shows the time evolution of the observational parameters ( @xmath1-ray and optical flux , degree of polarization and positional angle ) within the model discussed above .",
    "values of the adjustable parameters are listed in table  [ tab_1 ] .",
    "several of the trends of the data resemble similar features in the model flux and polarization curves .",
    "particularly , we see a succession of quasi - periodic flares before and after the main outburst ( marked with vertical arrows in fig  [ s5total2011 ] ) and fast oscillation of the degree of polarization around the main flare .",
    "this conforms with the model presented here .",
    "turbulence may play a role in modulating the behavior ( e.g. , the discrepant flux and degree of polarization near mjd  55675 ) beyond the capabilities of the simplified model proposed here .",
    "the @xmath1-ray outburst started @xmath814 before the optical , which corresponds to @xmath82  pc distance in the source frame .",
    "the emergence of knot k3 at the same time as the optical/@xmath1-ray outburst leads to the conclusion that these events were co - spatial .",
    "however , we note that our model uses a lower lorentz factor of the shock wave ( @xmath83 ) and a wider viewing angle ( @xmath84 ) than that obtained from the radio images ( @xmath85 ) . this could reflect acceleration of the plasma flow in the jet downstream from the regions where the optical/@xmath1-ray outburst took place ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
