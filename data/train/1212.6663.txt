    "are two simple ideas for reducing the complexity or dimension of a problem that are widely applicable because of their simplicity and generality :    * * sparsity : * resolving a complicated entity , represented by a function @xmath0 , into a sum of a small number of simple or elemental constituents : @xmath1 * * separability : * decoupling a complicated entity , represented by a function @xmath2 , that depends on multiple factors into a product of simpler constituents , each depending only on one factor : @xmath3    the two ideas underlie some of the most useful techniques in engineering and science  fourier , wavelets , and other orthogonal or sparse representations of signals and images , singular value and eigenvalue decompositions of matrices , separation - of - variables , fast fourier transform , mean field approximation , etc .",
    "this article examines the model that combines these two simple ideas:@xmath4 and we are primarily interested in its _ inverse problem _ ,",
    "i.e. , identification of the factors @xmath5 based on noisy measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "we shall see that this is a surprisingly effective method for a wide range of identification problems .",
    "here , @xmath0 is approximately encoded by @xmath6 scalars , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 functions , @xmath5 , @xmath9 ; @xmath10 . since",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath6 are both assumed to be small , we expect to be a very compact , possibly approximate , representation of @xmath0 .",
    "we will assume that all these functions live in a hilbert space with inner product @xmath12 , and that @xmath5 are of unit norm ( clearly possible since the norm of @xmath5 can be ` absorbed into ' the coefficient @xmath13 in ) .",

    "hence we may in principle identify @xmath5 based only on measurements of the mixture @xmath0 .",
    "one of the keys in the identifiability requirement is that @xmath18 or otherwise ( when @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) the result would not hold . we will show that the condition @xmath18 however leads to a difficulty ( that does not happen when @xmath20 or @xmath21 ) . since it is rarely , if not never , the case that one has the exact values of @xmath0 , the decomposition is only useful in an idealized scenario . in reality",
    ", one has @xmath22 , an estimate of @xmath0 corrupted by noise @xmath23 . solving the inverse problem",
    "to would require that we solve a best approximation problem .",
    "for example , with the appropriate noise models ( see section  [ est ] ) , the best approximation problem often takes the form@xmath24 with @xmath25 an @xmath26-norm .",
    "now , the trouble is that when @xmath18 , this best approximation problem may not have a solution  because the infimum of the loss function is unattainable in general , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : exist ] . in view of this",
    ", our next result is that when @xmath27 the infimum in is always attainable , thereby alleviating the aforementioned difficulty .",

    "the notion of _ sparsity _ dates back to harmonic analysis @xcite and approximation theory @xcite , and has received a lot of recent attention in compressive sensing @xcite .",
    "the notion of _ separability _ is also classical  the basis behind the separation - of - variables technique in partial differential equations @xcite and special functions @xcite , fast fourier transforms on arbitrary groups @xcite , mean field approximations in statistical physics @xcite , and the nave bayes model in machine learning @xcite .",
    "we describe a simple model that incorporates the two notions .",
    "the function @xmath29 or @xmath30 to be resolved into simpler entities will be referred to as our _ target function_. we will treat the discrete ( @xmath31 is finite or countably infinite ) and continuous ( @xmath31 is a continuum ) cases on an equal footing .",
    "the discrete cases are when @xmath0 is a vector ( if @xmath32 : = \\{1,\\dots , n_{1}\\}$ ] ) , a matrix ( if @xmath32\\times [ n_{2}]$ ] ) , a hypermatrix ( if @xmath32\\times [ n_{2}]\\times\\dots\\times [ n_{d}]$ ] ) , while the usual continuous cases are when @xmath0 is a function on some domain @xmath33 or @xmath34 . in the discrete cases ,",
    "the set of target functions under consideration are identified with @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 respectively whereas in the continuous cases , we usually impose some additional regularity structures such integrability or differentability , so that the set of target functions under consideration are @xmath38 or @xmath39 or @xmath40 , etc .",
    "we will only assume that the space of target functions is a hilbert space .",
    "note that the requirement @xmath18 implies that @xmath0 is at least a @xmath41-dimensional hypermatrix in the discrete case or a function of at least three continuous variables , i.e. , @xmath42 , in the continuous case .",
    "the identifiability does not work for ( usual @xmath21-dimensional ) matrices or bivariate functions . with in mind , we will call @xmath0 a @xmath11__-partite _ _ or _ multipartite _ function if we wish to partition its arguments into @xmath11 blocks of variables .",
    "we will briefly examine the decompositions and approximations of our target function into a sum or integral of separable functions , adopting a tripartite notation for simplicity .",

    "* * semidiscrete:**@xmath46 this may be viewed as a discretization of the continuous case in the @xmath47 variable , i.e. , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . * * * discrete:**@xmath51 this may be viewed as a further discretization of the semidiscrete case , i.e.@xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath56 take finitely many values , the discrete decomposition is always possible with a finite @xmath6 since the space is of finite dimension .",
    "if @xmath56 could take infinitely many values , then the finiteness of @xmath6 requires that equality be replaced by approximation to any arbitrary precision @xmath57 in some suitable norm .",
    "this follows from the following observation about the semidiscrete decomposition : the space of functions with a semidiscrete representation as in , with @xmath6 finite , is dense in @xmath58 , the space of continuous functions .",
    "this is just a consequence of the stone - weierstrass theorem @xcite .",
    "discussion of the most general case would require us to go into integral operators , which we will not do as in the present framework we are interested in applications that rely on the inverse problems corresponding to and .",
    "nonetheless is expected to be useful and we state it here for completeness .",
    "henceforth , we will simply refer to or as a _ multilinear decomposition _ ,",
    "by which we mean a decomposition into a _ linear combination of separable functions_. we note here that the finite - dimensional discrete version has been studied under several different names  see section  [ applications - sec ] .",
    "our emphasis in this paper is the semidiscrete version that applies to multipartite functions on arbitrary domains and are not necessarily finite - dimensional . as such , we will frame most of our discussions in terms of the semidiscrete case , which of course includes the discrete version as a special case ( when @xmath59 take only finite discrete values ) .",
    "multilinear decompositions arise in many contexts . in machine learning or nonparametric statistics ,",
    "a fact of note is that gaussians are separable @xmath60 more generally for symmetric positive - definite @xmath61 with eigenvalues @xmath62 , @xmath63 under a linear change of coordinates @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "hence gaussian mixture models of the form @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 for all @xmath68 ( and therefore @xmath69 have a common eigenbasis ) may likewise be transformed with a suitable linear change of coordinates into a multilinear decomposition as in .",
    "we will later see several more examples from signal processing , telecommunications , and spectroscopy .      the multilinear decomposition ",
    "an _ additive _ decomposition into _ multiplicatively _ decomposable components  is extremely simple but models a wide range of phenomena in signal processing and spectroscopy .",
    "the main message of this article is that the corresponding inverse problem  recovering the factors @xmath70 from noisy measurements of @xmath0  can be solved under mild assumptions and yields a class of techniques for a range of applications ( cf .",
    "section  [ applications - sec ] ) that we shall collectively call _ multilinear identification_. we wish to highlight in particular that multilinear identification gives a deterministic approach for solving the problem of joint localization and estimation of radiating sources with short data lengths .",
    "this is superior to previous cumulants - based approaches @xcite , which require ( i ) longer data lengths ; and ( ii ) statistically independent sources .",
    "the experienced reader would probably guess that such a powerful technique must be fraught with difficulties and he would be right .",
    "the inverse problem to , like most other inverse problems , faces issues of existence , uniqueness , and computability .",
    "the approximation problem involved can be ill - posed in the worst possible way ( cf .",
    "section  [ problem - sec ] ) .",
    "fortunately , in part prompted by recent work in compressed sensing @xcite and matrix completion @xcite ) , we show that mild assumptions on _ coherence _ allows one to overcome most of these difficulties ( cf .  section  [ angular - sec ] ) .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the notion of rank , which measures the sparsity of a multilinear decomposition , and the notion of kruskal rank , which measures the uniqueness of a multilinear decomposition in a somewhat more restrictive sense .",
    "why is uniqueness important ?",
    "it can be answered in one word : identifiability .",
    "more specifically , a unique decomposition means that we may in principle identify the factors . to be completely precise , we will first need to define the terms in the previous sentence , namely , ` unique ' , ` decomposition ' , and ` factor ' . before we do that",
    ", we will introduce the tensor product notation .",
    "it is not necessary to know anything about tensor product of hilbert spaces to follow what we present below .",
    "we shall assume that all our hilbert spaces are separable and so there is no loss of generality in assuming at the outset that they are just @xmath71 for some @xmath72-finite @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath73 be @xmath72-finite measurable spaces .",
    "there is a natural hilbert space isomorphism @xmath74 in other words , every @xmath11-partite @xmath26-function @xmath75 may be expressed as - functions are undefined in general .",
    "so equations like these are taken to implicitly mean _ almost everywhere_. anyway all functions that arise in our applications will at least be continuous and so this is really not a point of great concern . ]",
    "@xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "the _ tensor product _ of functions @xmath78 is denoted by @xmath79 and is the function in @xmath80 defined by@xmath81 with this notation , we may rewrite as@xmath82 a point worth noting here is that :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ `` _ _ multipartite functions are infinite - dimensional tensors . _ _ '' _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    finite - dimensional tensors are simply the special case when @xmath83 are all finite sets ( see example  [ eg : hitch ] ) . in particular , a multivariate function can come from any @xmath73 but a multivariate function , in the usual sense of the word , is one where @xmath73 are ( measurable ) subsets of @xmath30 . for example , while @xmath84 is not separable in the multivariate sense , it is separable in the multipartite sense : for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 ] @xmath89 is a an infinite - dimensional tensor that can expressed as an infinite sum of a tensor product of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we shall have more to say about this later in conjunction with kolmogorov s superposition principle for multivariate functions .    in this paper",
    ", functions having a _ finite _ decomposition will play a central role ; for these we define @xmath92 provided @xmath93 .",
    "the zero function is defined to have rank @xmath94 and we say @xmath95 if such a decomposition is not possible",

    "if we wish to refer to a function @xmath0 with rank exactly @xmath6 , we will just specify that @xmath98 . in this case , the rank-@xmath6 multilinear decomposition in is of mininum length and we call it a _ rank - retaining multilinear decomposition _ of @xmath0 .",
    "a rank-@xmath99 function is both non - zero and decomposable , i.e. , of the form @xmath79 where @xmath100 .",
    "this agrees precisely with the notion of a separable function .",
    "observe that the inner product ( and therefore the norm ) on @xmath80 of a rank-@xmath99 function splits into a product@xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the inner product of @xmath103 .",

    "otherwise there will be functions in @xmath80 of infinite rank .",
    "however , since we have assumed that @xmath73 are @xmath72-finite measurable spaces , the set of all finite - rank @xmath0 will always be dense in @xmath80 by the stone - weierstrass theorem .",
    "the next statement is a straightforward observation about multilinear decompositions of finite - rank functions but since it is central to this article we state it as a theorem .",
    "it is also tempting to call the decomposition a ` singular value decomposition ' given its similarities with the usual matrix singular value decomposition ( cf .",
    "example  [ eg : svd ] ) .",

    ", the one crucial difference here is that our ` singular vectors ' @xmath115 in will only be of unit norms but will not in general be orthonormal . given this , we will not expect properties like the eckhart - young theorem , or that @xmath116 , etc , to hold for ( cf .  section  [ illposed - sec ] for more details ) .",

    "the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath129 yields one such decomposition , where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are both orthonormal .",

    "so a simple but artificial way to prevent the nonexistence issue is to simply limit the sizes of the coefficients @xmath222 in the approximant .",

    "the main drawback of such constraints is that @xmath279 and @xmath214 are arbitrary , and that they generally have no physical meaning .",
    "more generally , one may alleviate the nonexistence issue by restricting the optimization problem to a compact subset of its non - compact feasible set@xmath280 limiting the sizes of @xmath222 is a special case but there are several other simple ( but also artificial ) strategies . in @xcite , the factors @xmath281 are required to be orthogonal _ for all _ @xmath282 , i.e.@xmath283 this remedy is acceptable only in very restrictive conditions .",

    "the feasible set in this case is non - compact and has nonempty interior within the feasible set of our original problem .",
    "the nonnegativity constraints are natural in some applications , such as the fluorescence spectroscopy one described in section  [ sec : fluo ] , where @xmath5 represent intensities and concentrations , and are therefore nonnegative valued .",
    "there are two major problems with imposing artificial constraints simply to force a solution : how do we know a priori that the solution that we seek would meet those constraints ? but more importantly , perhaps the model is ill - posed and a solution indeed should not exist ? to illustrate the case in point with a more commonplace example , suppose we want to find a maximum likelihood estimator @xmath287 for the covariance @xmath288 of independent samples @xmath289 .",
    "this would lead us to a semi - definite programming problem@xmath290 where @xmath291 .",

    "this is an indication that we should seek more samples ( so that we could get @xmath293 , which will guarantee the attainment of the infimum ) or use a different model ( e.g. , determine if @xmath294 might have some a priori zero entries due to statistical independence of the variables ) .",
    "it is usually unwise to impose artificial constraints on the covariance matrix @xmath31 just so that the loss function in would attain an infimum on a smaller feasible set  the thereby obtained ` solution ' may bear no relation to the true solution that we want .",

    "the goal is to be able to work with extremely short samples .    in order to face this challenge , we assume that the sensor array is structured , as in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the sensor array comprises a _ reference array _ with @xmath532 sensors , whose location is defined by a vector @xmath533 , and @xmath534 other subarrays obtained from the reference array by a translation in space defined by a vector @xmath535 , @xmath536 .",

    "generic rank_. since the generic rank is at least as large as @xmath563 , which is always larger than kruskal s bound @xcite , we are led to the problem of approximating the hypermatrix @xmath562 by another of rank @xmath6 .",
    "we have seen that the angular constraint imposed in section  [ angular - sec ] permits us to deal with a well - posed problem . in order to see the physical meaning of this constraint ,",

    "the quantity @xmath590 may thus be viewed as a measure of angular separation between @xmath559 and @xmath591 , as we shall demonstrate in proposition  [ collinear - prop ] .",
    "[ resolvent - def]we shall say that a collection of vectors @xmath592 is * resolvent * with respect to a direction @xmath593 if there exist two indices @xmath176 and @xmath594 such that @xmath595 and@xmath596 where @xmath597 denotes the wavelength .",

    "the vector @xmath608 must be @xmath610 because it is orthogonal to three linearly independent vectors in @xmath611 .",
    "the converse is immediate from the definition of @xmath598 .",

    "thanks to proposition  [ collinear - prop ] , we now know that uniqueness of the matrix factor @xmath612 $ ] and the identifiability of the directions of arrival @xmath559 are equivalent . by the results of section  [ angular - sec ] , the uniqueness can be ensured by a constraint on coherence such as .    as in section  [ antennaproduct - sec ]",

    ", one can separate paths with arbitrarily high correlation provided they are sufficiently well separated in space .",
    "hence , the decomposition of a sensor array into a tensor product of two ( or more ) sensor subarrays depends not only on kruskal s bound , as elaborated in section  [ antennaproduct - sec ] , but also on the ability of the latter subarrays to separate two distinct directions of arrival ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ collinear - prop ] ) .",
    "the application to antenna array processing we described in section  [ jointchannelsource - sec ] also applies to all source separation problems @xcite , provided an additional diversity is available .",
    "an example is the case of code division multiple access ( cdma ) communications .",
    "in fact , as pointed out in @xcite , it is possible to distinguish between symbol and chip diversities .",
    "we will elaborate on the latter example .    consider a downlink cdma communication with @xmath6 users , each assigned a spreading sequence @xmath614 , @xmath615 , @xmath616 .",

    "the columns of matrix @xmath624 are often referred to as `` effective codes '' , and coincide with spreading codes if the channel is memoryless and noiseless .",
    "in practice , the receiver filter is matched to the transmitter shaping filter combined with the propagation channel , so that effective and spreading codes are ideally proportional . under these conditions , the coherence @xmath625 accounts for the angular separation between spreading sequences : @xmath626 means that they are orthogonal .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath627 means that the symbol sequences are all uncorrelated .",
    "lastly , as seen in proposition  [ collinear - prop ] , @xmath628 means that the directions of arrival are collinear .    in order to avoid multiple access interferences ,",
    "spreading sequences are usually chosen to be uncorrelated for all delays , which implies that they are orthogonal .",
    "however , the results obtained in section  [ angular - sec ] show that spreading sequences _ do not need to be orthogonal _ , and symbol sequences _ need not be uncorrelated _ , as long as the directions of arrival are not collinear . in particular , shorter spreading sequences may be used for the same number of users , which increases throughput .",
    "alternatively , for a given spreading gain , one may increase the number of users .",
    "these are possible because the coherence conditions in section  [ angular - sec ] allow one to relax the constraint of having almost orthogonal spreading sequences . on the other hand , some directions of arrival",
    "may be collinear if the corresponding spreading sequences are sufficiently well separated angularly .",
    "these conclusions are essentially valid when users are synchronized , i.e. , for downlink communications .      the use of polarization as an additional diversity has its roots in @xcite .",
