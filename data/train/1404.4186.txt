    "one of the most important and challenging problem in the rigorous approach to non - equilibrium statistical mechanics is the characterization of stationary nonequilibrium states exhibiting transport phenomena such as energy or mass transport , which are macroscopically described by fourier s and fick s law respectively .",
    "unfortunately , there are very few rigorous results on these arguments in the current literature .    in this paper",
    "we propose a contribution in this direction by validating the fick s law for the lorentz model , which is a system of non interacting light particles in a random distribution of scatterers , in a situation of low density .",
    "more precisely the system we study is the following .",
    "consider the two - dimensional strip @xmath0 in the left and in the right of the boundaries , @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , there are two mass reservoirs constituted by free point particles at equilibrium at different densities @xmath3 , @xmath4 . inside the strip",
    "there is a random distribution of hard disks of radius @xmath5 , distributed according to a poisson law with density @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath5 is a small scale parameter and we let it go to zero . in the mean time @xmath6 is diverging in such a way that @xmath7 and @xmath8 . therefore the scatterer configuration is dilute .",
    "the light particles are flowing through the boundaries , from right with density @xmath4 and from left with density @xmath3 they are not interacting among themselves , but are elastically reflected by the obstacles .",
    "since the elastic collisions preserve the kinetic energy of the light particles , we can assume they are distributed in the unit circle @xmath9 .",
    "we expect that there exists a stationary state for which @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the mass current , @xmath12 is the mass density and @xmath13 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "formula is the well known fick s law which we want to prove in the present context .",
    "we underline preliminary that our result holds in a low - density regime .",
    "this means that we can use the linear boltzmann equation as a bridge between our original mechanical system and the diffusion equation .",
    "this basic idea has been used in @xcite @xcite @xcite to obtain the heat equation from a particle system in different contexts .",
    "it works once having an explicit control of the error in the kinetic limit , which suggests the scale of times for which the diffusive limit can be achieved . as a consequence the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 is given by the green - kubo formula for the kinetic equation at hand ( namely linear quantum boltzmann for @xcite , linear boltzmann for @xcite , linear landau for @xcite ) . in the present paper we work in a stationary situation for which we face new problems which will be discussed later on .",
    "the more ambitious problem of detecting the fick s law for a dense scatterer distribution , in a diffusive scaling , eludes our techniques and it seems to be a far target .",
    "the idea of using the linear boltzmann equation for the lorentz gas in not new . in @xcite",
    "the authors consider exactly our system but with two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures at the boundaries .",
    "the aim was to study the energy flux in a stationary regime .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , due to the energy conservation of a single elastic collision , the energy is not diffused , there is no local equilibrium and hence the local temperature is not defined . as a consequence the fourier s law fails to hold , at least in the conventional sense .",
    "this is the reason why we consider here the mass transport , being the heat equation for the mass density the unique hydrodynamical equation",
    ".    it may be worth to mention that , for a suitable stochastic dynamics , the fourier s law can indeed be derived , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "concerning the fick s law we mention the papers @xcite , @xcite , for the self - diffusion of a tagged particle in a gas at equilibrium .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "the starting point is the transition from the mechanical system to the boltzmann equation in a low density regime .",
    "we follow the classical analysis due to gallavotti @xcite , complemented by an explicit analysis of the bad events preventing the markovianity , in the same spirit of @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is necessary to reach a diffusive behavior on a longer time scale as in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover we point out that our initial boundary value problem presents a new feature due to the presence of the first exit ( stopping ) time .",
    "this difficulty is handled by an extension procedure which essentially reduces our problem to the corresponding one in the whole space .",
    "the transition from the mechanical system to the linear boltzmann regime is presented in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "however we are interested in a stationary problem .",
    "this is handled , more conveniently , in terms of a neumann series , rather than as the limit for large time , to avoid problems connected with the exchange of the limits @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this analysis is presented in section [ proofs ] .",
    "the basic idea is that the explicit solution of the heat equation and the control of the time dependent problem allow us to characterize the stationary solution of the linear boltzmann equation and this turns out to be the basic tool to obtain the stationary solution of the mechanical system which is the basic object of our investigation .",
    "finally the transition from boltzmann to the diffusion equation is classical and ruled out by the hilbert expansion method which is presented in section [ sec4hilbert ] .",
    "this step is discussed in detail , not only for completeness , but also because we need an apparently new analysis in @xmath17 , for the time dependent problem ( needed for the control of the neumann series ) and a @xmath18 analysis for the stationary problem .",
    "let @xmath19 be the strip @xmath20 .",
    "we consider a poisson distribution of fixed hard disks ( scatterers ) of radius @xmath5 in @xmath21 and denote by @xmath22 their centers .",
    "this means that , given @xmath23 , the probability density of finding @xmath24 obstacles in a bounded measurable set @xmath25 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "+ a particle in @xmath21 moves freely up to the first instant of contact with an obstacle .",
    "then it is elastically reflected and so on .",
    "since the modulus of the velocity of the test particle is constant , we assume it to be equal to one , so that the phase space of our system is @xmath29 .    we rescale the intensity @xmath30 of the obstacles as @xmath31 where , from now on , @xmath23 is fixed and @xmath32 is slowly diverging as @xmath16 . more precisely we make the following assumption .",
    "[ a1 ] as @xmath33 , @xmath34 diverges in such a way that @xmath35    accordingly , we denote by @xmath36 the probability density with @xmath30 replaced by @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 will be the expectation with respect to the measure @xmath36 restricted on those configurations of the obstacles whose centers do not belong to the disk of center @xmath39 and radius @xmath5 .    for a given configuration of obstacles @xmath40 , we denote by @xmath41 the ( backward ) flow with initial datum @xmath42 and define @xmath43 , @xmath44 , as the first ( backward ) hitting time with the boundary .",
    "we use the notation @xmath45 to indicate the event such that the trajectory @xmath46 , @xmath47 $ ] , never hits the boundary . for any @xmath48 the one - particle correlation function reads @xmath49 + { \\mathbb{e}}_{\\varepsilon}[f_0 ( t^{-t}_{{\\mathbf}{c}_{n}}(x , v))\\chi(\\tau=0)],\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and the boundary value @xmath51 is defined by @xmath52 with @xmath53 the density of the uniform distribution on @xmath9 and @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 denotes the horizontal component of the velocity @xmath56 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume @xmath57 .",
    "since @xmath58 , from now on we will absorb it in the definition of the boundary values @xmath59 .",
    "therefore we set @xmath60    here we allow overlapping of scatterers , namely the poisson measure is that of a free gas .",
    "it would also be possible to consider the poisson measure restricted to non - overlapping configurations , namely the gibbs measure for a systems of hard disks in the plane .",
    "however the two measures are asymptotically equivalent and the result does hold also in the last case .    note also that the dynamics @xmath61 is well defined only almost everywhere with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "we are interested in the stationary solutions @xmath62 of the above problem .",
    "more precisely @xmath63 solves @xmath64 + { \\mathbb{e}}_{\\varepsilon}[f _ { \\varepsilon}^s(t^{-t}_{{\\mathbf}{c}_{n}}(x , v))\\chi(\\tau=0)].\\ ] ]    the main result of the present paper can be summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ th : main1 ] for @xmath5 sufficiently small there exists a unique @xmath17 stationary solution @xmath65 for the microscopic dynamics ( i.e. satisfying ) .",
    "moreover , as @xmath33 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the stationary solution of the heat equation with the following boundary conditions @xmath68 the convergence is in @xmath69 .",
    "some remarks on the above theorem are in order .",
    "the boundary conditions of the problem depend on the space variable only through the horizontal component . as a consequence",
    ", the stationary solution @xmath65 of the microscopic problem , as well as the stationary solution @xmath67 of the heat equation , inherits the same feature .",
    "this justifies the convergence in @xmath69 instead of in @xmath70 . the explicit expression for the stationary solution",
    "@xmath67 reads @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the horizontal component of the space variable @xmath39 .",
    "we note that in order to prove theorem [ th : main1 ] it is enough to assume that @xmath73 the stronger assumption [ a1 ] is needed to prove theorem [ th : main2 ] below .",
    "+    next we discuss the fick s law by introducing the stationary mass flux @xmath74 and the stationary mass density @xmath75 note that @xmath76 is the total amount of mass flowing through a unit area in a unit time interval .",
    "although in a stationary problem there is no typical time scale , the factor @xmath32 appearing in the definition of @xmath76 , is reminiscent of the time scaling necessary to obtain a diffusive limit .",
    "[ th : main2 ] we have @xmath77 as @xmath16 .",
    "the convergence is in @xmath78 and @xmath13 is given by the green - kubo formula ( see below ) .",
    "moreover @xmath79 where the convergence is in @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath67 is the linear profile .",
    "observe that , as expected by physical arguments , the stationary flux @xmath82 does not depend on the space variable .",
    "furthermore the diffusion coefficient @xmath14 is determined by the behavior of the system at equilibrium and in particular it is equal to the diffusion coefficient for the time dependent problem .",
    "we have formulated our result in macroscopic variables @xmath83 .",
    "another point of view is to argue in terms of microscopic variables .",
    "let us set our problem in these variables denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "this means that the radius of the disks is unitary while the strip , seen in micro - variables , is @xmath85 .    to deal with a low density situation ,",
    "we rescale the density as @xmath86 , @xmath23 where @xmath32 is gently diverging . note that in the usual boltzmann - grad limit @xmath87 at times of order @xmath88 , one particle has an average number of collisions of order @xmath32 . at larger times , namely of order @xmath89 , we expect a diffusive behavior .",
    "actually this emerges from the linear boltzmann equation ( see equation and proposition below ) which is derived from the microscopic dynamics through the scaling @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we prove theorems [ th : main1 ] and [ th : main2 ] , postponing the technical details to the next sections . in order to prove theorem [ th : main1 ]",
    "our strategy is the following .",
    "we introduce the stationary linear boltzmann equation @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the linear boltzmann operator defined as @xmath94,\\qquad   f\\in l^1(s_1)\\ ] ] with @xmath95 and @xmath96 the outward normal to the hard disk ( see figure [ fig : opk ] ) .",
    "since the boundary conditions depend on the space variable only trough the horizontal component , the stationary solution @xmath97 inherits the same feature , as well as @xmath65 and @xmath98 .    the strategy of the proof consists of two steps .",
    "first we prove that there exists a unique @xmath97 which converges , as @xmath16 , to @xmath67 given by .",
    "see proposition [ prop : hsrhos ] below .",
    "secondly we show that there exists a unique @xmath62 asymptotically equivalent to @xmath97 .",
    "see proposition [ prop : fshs ] below .",
    "this result is achieved by showing that the memory effects of the mechanical system , preventing the markovianity , are indeed negligible .",
    "let @xmath99 be the solution of the problem @xmath100    then @xmath99 has the following explicit representation @xmath101 with @xmath51 defined in . given @xmath102 , @xmath103 denotes the trajectory whose position and velocity are @xmath104 the transitions @xmath105 are obtained by means of a scattering with an hard disk with impact parameter @xmath106 via . as before @xmath43 , @xmath107 , is the first ( backward ) hitting time with the boundary .",
    "we remind that @xmath108    in formula @xmath109 results as the sum of two contributions , one due to the backward trajectories hitting the boundary and the other one due to the trajectories which never leave @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we set @xmath110 where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are respectively the first and the second sum on the right hand side of .",
    "observe that @xmath111 solves @xmath113 we denote by @xmath114 the markov semigroup associated to the second sum , namely @xmath115 with @xmath116 in particular @xmath117 we observe that @xmath97 , solution of , satysfies , for @xmath118 @xmath119 so that we can formally express @xmath97 as the neumann series @xmath120    note that @xmath97 is a fixed point of the map @xmath121 solution to .",
    "hence @xmath97 belongs to a periodic orbit , of period @xmath122 , of the flow @xmath123 .",
    "but this orbit consists of a single point because the neumann series , being convergent , identifies a single element .",
    "this implies that @xmath97 is constant with respect to the flow and hence stationary .",
    "we now establish existence and uniqueness of @xmath97 by showing that the neumann series converges . in order to do it",
    "we need to extend the action of the semigroup @xmath114 to the space @xmath124 , namely @xmath125 for any @xmath126 here @xmath127 is the characteristic function of @xmath21 .",
    "[ prop : existenceheps ] there exists @xmath128 such that for any @xmath129 and for any @xmath130 we have @xmath131 satisfying ( [ eq : boltz2 ] ) .    to prove proposition [ prop : existenceheps ] we have first to exploit the diffusive limit of the linear boltzmann equation in a @xmath132 setting and in the whole space .",

    "the proof relies on the hilbert expansion and , to make it work , we need smoothness of the initial datum @xmath135 .    [ proof of proposition [ prop : existenceheps ] ] we can rewrite as @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the first component of @xmath103 .",
    "note that the insertion of @xmath143 is due to the constraint @xmath144 .",
