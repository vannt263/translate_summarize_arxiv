    "tropomyosin ( tm ) is the protein that plays the key role in the regulation of muscle contraction @xcite .",
    "it comes in a rod - like form and binds to the groove each side of double - helical actin filaments ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3d ] ) .",
    "actin filaments give the cytoskeleton its mechanical stability and serve as tracks for motor proteins from the myosin family , especially in muscle cells . in muscle",
    "each tropomyosin molecule covers 7 actin monomers @xcite .",
    "other tropomyosins covering 6 and 5 monomers exist as well ( reviewed by @xcite ) , but for specificity we will focus on tm covering 7 actin subunits . together with the associated protein troponin ,",
    "tm on actin can switch between two laterally shifted conformations @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium between these two conformations is strongly influenced by the concentration of @xmath0 ions .",
    "as one conformation obstructs the strong binding of myosin to actin @xcite , this provides the mechanism of calcium - mediated activation of myosin in skeletal muscle cells .",
    "the regulation of myosin activity has been widely studied using actin - tropomyosin filaments assembled in vitro @xcite .",
    "other functions of tm might include the stabilization of actin against fragmentation and actin assembly @xcite .",
    "the binding of tropomyosin to actin has been studied in equilibrium @xcite as well as dynamically @xcite and has been found to be highly cooperative @xcite .",
    "but the way that tropomyosin binds to actin is not simple .",
    "as each tm molecule occupies 7 actin monomers , an obvious problem is that sometimes a gap of 1 - 6 monomers , too short for another tm molecule to be inserted , can remain on actin .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that these gaps could play an important role by regulating the binding of @xmath1-actinin and the fragmentation kinetics of actin .",
    "( @xmath2 ) , at the `` @xmath3 '' side of another bound tm molecule @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , at the `` @xmath6 '' side @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , and between two bound tm molecules @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xmath11 denotes the concentration of tm in solution . ]    in this article , we study a theoretical model for the dynamics of binding of tm to actin based on the reaction kinetics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme ] , first proposed by wegner and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of bound molecules and vacancies has been known exactly for a long time @xcite and represents a special case of a more general model solved by @xcite . however , as we have previously shown in the context of kinesin on microtubules @xcite , the time necessary to reach the equilibrium state can be very long .",
    "there are many similarities between the binding of dimeric kinesin on microtubules and tm on actin . in both situations",
    "there is an initial period in which all gaps that are wide enough to accept a new molecule get filled .",
    "the dynamics within this period has been directly experimentally observed using fluorescent techniques @xcite .",
    "after the initial period , only vacancies stretching over 1 to 6 actin monomers , too small for another tm molecule to fit in , remain .",
    "they get healed out in a much slower annealing process in which bound molecules detach and others re - attach at other places .",
    "this process takes place on a much slower time scale .",
    "the annealing process is finished when the system reaches the equilibrium state . despite the similarities with the binding of kinesin onto microtubules , there are also important differences :    1 .",
    "the tm molecules occupy 7 instead of two binding sites .",
    "2 .   kinesin dimers can bind with one head as well as with two , while tm must either bind all sites or be fully detached .",
    "the interaction between bound tropomyosin molecules is much stronger .    in our theoretical analysis",
    "we make reasonable simplifications justified by experimental observations and then use results from diffusion - annihilation models to find an analytical solution for the dynamics in our model .",
    "the central result is the prediction of the number of defects ( gaps between contiguous blocks of tropomyosin ) as a function of time for a given solution concentration .",
    "the fact that a tropomyosin molecule occupies 7 binding sites makes it especially interesting from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the size 7 lies between the simple monomeric or dimeric and continuous models . we have shown previously that the relaxational behavior of the dimer adsorption - desorption model can be explained by a mapping onto the @xmath12 diffusion - annihilation model @xcite .",
    "the gap density decays with a power - law @xmath13 before it approaches the final equilibrium value .",
    "this behavior remains qualitatively valid even if there is an attractive interaction between adsorbed dimers .",
    "if one introduces a strong diffusion of adsorbed dimers the power - law decay is preceded by a mean - field regime in which @xmath14 @xcite . on the other hand , non - interacting @xmath15-mers ( @xmath16 )",
    "are always well described with the mean - field kinetics of the model @xmath17 which predicts a gap density decay @xmath18 @xcite . in the continuous limit , also called continuous sequential adsorption ( csa ) or `` car parking problem '' the length of unoccupied space decays as @xmath19 in the mean - field regime @xcite .",
    "we will show that our model ( @xmath20 with strong attractive interaction ) differs from all models mentioned above and that it maps onto a @xmath21 model , which includes particle annihilation as well as coagulation .",
    "our model is based on the reaction scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_scheme ] and is defined as follows .",
    "we assume that there is no interaction between bound tm molecules on the opposite sides of the actin polymer and therefore describe actin as two independent one - dimensional binding lattices .",
    "we further assume that tm molecules can bind to actin only with their whole length , thereby occupying 7 binding actin monomers .",
    "the rate at which a tm molecule binds to a group of seven free binding sites on actin is @xmath22 where @xmath11 denotes the tm concentration .",
    "the rate for the reverse reaction , i.e. , the detachment of a tm molecule without neighbors , is @xmath2 .",
    "the rate at which new tm molecules bind beside already bound ones ( we call such sites single - contiguous binding sites ) will be denoted as @xmath23 ( the rate at which the new tm binds on the plus side of a previously occupied block ) and @xmath24 ( on the minus side ) .",
    "the reverse reaction rates are @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the binding constants are only influenced by nearest neighbors .",
    "finally the attachment rate in a gap of exactly 7 lattice sites will be @xmath25 and the detachment rate in the middle of a contiguous block @xmath10 .",
    "the principle of detailed balance states that the ratio between the binding and unbinding rate depends only on the free energy difference and therefore has the same value regardless whether a molecule binds on the plus or minus side of an occupied block @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes the coupling energy between two tm molecules on actin and @xmath28 the cooperativity coefficient @xcite .",
    "the coupling energy from both ends is additive , therefore @xmath29    in the following we will assume a strong interaction between bound molecules , @xmath30 . the assumption is well justified since the cooperativity coefficient has been determined to be between @xmath31 and @xmath32 by @xcite and around @xmath33 by @xcite .",
    "the binding affinity of an isolated tm molecule has been found to be very low @xcite and we may assume @xmath34 when discussing the dynamics we will neglect all processes where a tm molecule detaches in the middle of a contiguous block , setting @xmath35 .",
    "the equilibrium solution of the problem on an infinite lattice has been known exactly for a long time @xcite .",
    "the number of attached tm molecules per lattice site @xmath36 ( which can assume values between @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) is given by the following implicit equation @xmath39 with @xmath40 the average gap size was determined as @xmath41 the fraction of unoccupied lattice sites is given as @xmath42 and the gap density as @xmath43 . in the limit of very high tm concentrations and nearly full coverage , @xmath44 ,",
    "the average gap size becomes @xmath45 .    however , the exact equilibrium configuration is of little value without the knowledge of the time the system needs to equilibrate ( relaxation time ) .",
    "figure [ fig_sim ] shows the time dependent filament coverage and gap concentration as obtained from a dynamic monte - carlo simulation for different tm concentrations with realistic values for the kinetic constants .",
    "as the simulation results show , the dynamics shows an interesting two - stage behavior at high tm concentrations . in the first stage ,",
    "tm molecules bind to actin wherever there is enough unoccupied space .",
    "the first stage is followed by a plateau and the second stage in which reordering of bound tm molecules takes place . in this",
    "second stage gaps that inevitably remain after the first stage are healed in an annealing process .",
    "the second stage is finally followed by an exponential relaxation into the equilibrium state given by eq .",
    "[ eq_mcghee ] .",
    "the second stage is much slower than the first one .",
    "we therefore conclude that in many experimental situations the relevant properties of the system are actually determined by the dynamic behavior of the model and not its equilibrium state .          in this section",
    "we describe the initial dynamics of tm starting with an empty actin filament .",
    "since a single tm molecule only weakly binds to actin ( eq .  [ eq_singleunstable ] ) nucleation is needed to initiate binding . for its description",
    "we use the approach first developed by @xcite in his ` grain growth ' model ( reviewed by @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "kolmogorov s model assumes that nucleation is sufficiently slower than grain growth , meaning that grains can grow to large sizes before the growth process is stopped by another grain .",
    "it therefore neglects fluctuations in the growth process and assumes a constant growth velocity .",
    "the nucleation , on the other hand , is described with its full stochasticity .",
    "where the blocks growing from two neighboring nuclei meet , there is a probability of @xmath46 that they will match exactly without leaving a gap ( fig .",
    "[ fig_newnucleus ] ) . in all other cases , occurring with a total probability of @xmath47 a gap of 1 - 6 sites will remain .",
    "the number of such gaps should therefore equal @xmath47 of the total number of nuclei .",
    "all gap sizes between 1 and 6 sites occur with equal probabilities and the average gap width is 3.5 sites .",
    "we calculate the number of gaps after the initial binding process in the following way . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the actin concentration is low enough that the tm concentration in the solution does not change significantly in time ( a generalization for a time - dependent solution concentration is discussed later ) .",
    "then the nucleation rate @xmath48 and the growth velocity @xmath49 are constant in time .",
    "the probability that a nucleus will be formed on site @xmath50 at time @xmath51 equals the nucleation rate at that time multiplied by the probability that the site has not been occupied previously .",
    "the latter equals to the probability that there is no nucleus in a triangle of height @xmath51 and base @xmath52 in the position - time diagram ( akin to the light cone frequently used to illustrate independent events in the special theory of relativity ) ( fig .",

    "this approximation is justified as long as @xmath65 .    if @xmath66 , two molecules bound beside each other already form a stable nucleus , while a single one does not ( eq .  [ eq_singleunstable ] ) .",

    "the amount of data gathered in different experimental studies allows us to make quite firm predictions for the vacancy density as a function of time .",
    "our modeling shows that in many relevant experimental situations , especially when using long filaments , the vacancy concentration is much higher than it would be in equilibrium .",
    "actin filaments used in skeletal muscle sarcomeres , on the other hand , are short enough that the tm equilibrates within a minute .",
    "therefore , care has to be taken when the calcium regulation of myosin activity is studied on filaments assembled in vitro , as calcium regulation is by itself a strongly cooperative process and therefore vulnerable to gaps in tm filaments .",
    "we also show that with realistic parameters the effect of the initial solution concentration on the vacancy density is rather small ( not more than a factor of 2 ) . the only way to eliminate gaps is to give the system enough time to equilibrate ( estimated as an hour on long filaments , though the gap concentration already reaches quite low values after a few minutes ) , or to assemble the actin and the tropomyosin filaments simultaneously .",
    "unfortunately , in none of the existing studies could the gap concentration be measured directly .",
    "but there could be indirect ways to test the predictions of our model .",
    "one possibility would be suddenly to decrease the tm concentration ( by dilution ) or binding affinity to actin ( by an increase in the salt concentration ) and study the detachment kinetics .",
    "as it is almost exclusively the tm molecules next to gaps that detach , the initial detachment rate could be a direct measure for the gap concentration .    to conclude",
    ", we have shown that the dynamics of tropomyosin binding to actin polymers shows many stages .",
    "an initial fast binding phase is followed by a slow annealing process before it reaches the final equilibrium .",
    "we could give analytical approximations for the time dependent gap density in all regimes , using elementary nucleation - growth models for the first stage and and a mapping to a reaction - diffusion model in the second stage .",
    "i am grateful to bernhard brenner for having introduced me to the problem of tropomyosin binding , to tom duke and jaime santos for the careful reading of the manuscript and to erwin frey for many helpful discussions .",
