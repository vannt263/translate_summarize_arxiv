    "when a capital latin letter stands for a matrix , the entries of the matrix are denoted by the corresponding lower case letter with two indices .",
    "for example , the entries of a matrix @xmath23 are @xmath24 s .",
    "the dependence of the continuous sturm - liouville eigenvalues on the problems and its applications have been extensively studied ( cf . , @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite , kong and zettl proved that the eigenvalues of continuous slps depend not only continuously but also smoothly on problems and then gave an expression for the derivative of the @xmath25-th eigenvalue with respect to a given parameter in the continuous slp .",
    "later , they , together with wu , gave a natural geometric structure on the space of bcs of continuous slps in @xcite .",
    "this structure is the base for studying the dependence of sturm - liouville eigenvalues on the bcs . in addition",
    ", they investigated the differentiability of continuous eigenvalue branches based on this structure , and discussed the relationships between the algebraic and geometric multiplicities of an eigenvalue .",
    "along another line , research on discrete spectral problems and their inverse problems has been of growing interest in recent years ( cf . ,",
    "e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "atkinson @xcite and jirari @xcite studied spectral problems of second - order discrete scalar self - adjoint slps with separate bcs . in @xcite ,",

    "it is evident that the bc is included in the bc .",
    "the spectral results obtained in @xcite will be used in the study of the multiplicity of eigenvalues in the present paper .",
    "further , the third author of the present paper with her coauthor lv studied error estimate of eigenvalues of perturbed problems , sufficiently close to a given sturm - liouville problem and , by some variational properties of the eigenvalues under a certain non - singularity condition in @xcite .",
    "so we obtained the continuous dependence of eigenvalues on problems under the nonsingularity condition .",
    "in chapter 2 of @xcite , kato investigated perturbation problems for linear operators in finite - dimensional spaces .",
    "he studied how the eigenvalues change with the operator , in particular when the operator analytically depends on a parameter .",
    "his method is based on function - theoretic study of the corresponding resolvent .",
    "obviously , the eigenvalue problem of the self - adjoint discrete slps consisting of - corresponds to that of an operator in a finite - dimensional space .",
    "note that the operator defined by - may be multi - valued since @xmath38 and @xmath39 may not be uniquely determined by the bc , and the problem discussed in the present paper is dependent on multi - parameters .",
    "however , the operators are all single - valued and their perturbations are only referred to one single parameter in @xcite .",
    "so the results in @xcite can not be directly available in our study .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall investigate dependence of eigenvalues on the slp consisting of and .",
    "there are two main motivations for our study .",
    "firstly , it is helpful to clarify the common features and differences between the class of continuous slps and that of discrete slps .",
    "secondly , it is hoped that findings of such work will form a theoretical foundation for numerical works on discrete slps and their inverse problems , and such numerical works will shed light on numerical works on continuous slps and their inverse problems .",
    "many results in the continuous case may be obtained from the corresponding results in the discrete case , via certain limit procedures , but not vice verse ; while some results in the discrete case have relatively direct proofs . in this way , shorter proofs of results in the continuous case may be found .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give topologies and geometric structures on various spaces of discrete slps , which are fundamental for further developments . in section 3",
    ", we first discuss properties of the analytic and geometric multiplicities of eigenvalues of the discrete slps and their relationships , and then study continuous dependence of eigenvalues on the problems . in section 4 ,",
    "we investigate some fundamental properties of continuous eigenvalue branches including their analyticity , differentiability and monotonicity .",
    "finally , several examples illustrating results of these sections are presented in section 5 .",
    "[ r11 ] we shall apply the results obtained in the present paper to study some other topics about discrete sturm - liouville problems , including dependence of the @xmath25-th eigenvalue on problems , inequalities among eigenvalues for different problems , and index problems for eigenvalues in our forthcoming papers .",
