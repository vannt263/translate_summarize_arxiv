    "the theory of relativity is one of the fundamental pillars of modern physics .",
    "however , because of the problems associated with merging relativity with quantum theory , it has long been felt that relativity may have to be modified in some way .",
    "it has been suggested that relativity , _ i.e. _ lorentz invariance ( li ) , may be only an approximate symmetry of nature@xcite .",
    "there has been a particular interest in the possibility that a breakdown of relativity may be associated with the planck scale of @xmath1 gev where quantum effects are expected to become significant in gravitational theory .",
    "although no true quantum theory of gravity exists , it was independently proposed that li might be violated in such a theory with astrophysical consequences@xcite being manifested at an energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "the subject of this paper is the potential use of observations of high energy phenomena from satellite detectors to search for the possible breakdown of lorentz invariance .",
    "a simple formulation for breaking li by a small first order perturbation in the electromagnetic lagrangian which leads to a renormalizable treatment has been given by coleman and glashow@xcite .",
    "the small perturbative noninvariant terms are both rotationally and translationally invariant in a preferred reference frame which one can assume to be the frame in which the cosmic background radiation is isotropic .",
    "these terms are also taken to be invariant under @xmath3 gauge transformations in the standard model .    with this form of li violation ( liv )",
    ", different particles can have differing maximum attainable velocities ( mavs ) and these mavs can be different from @xmath4 . using the formalism of ref .",
    ", we denote the mav of a particle of type @xmath5 by @xmath6 , a quantity which is not necessarily equal to @xmath7 , the low energy _ in vacua _ velocity of light .",
    "we further define the difference @xmath8 .",
    "these definitions will be used to discuss the physics implications of cosmic ray and cosmic @xmath9-ray observations@xcite .",
    "in general then , @xmath10 .",
    "the physical consequences of such a violation of li depend on the sign of the difference between these two mavs . defining    @xmath11",
    "one can consider the two cases of positive and negative values of @xmath12 separately@xcite .",
    "_ case i : _ if @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) , the decay of a photon into an electron - positron pair is kinematically allowed for photons with energies exceeding    @xmath15    the decay would take place rapidly , so that photons with energies exceeding @xmath16 could not be observed either in the laboratory or as cosmic rays . from the fact that photons have been observed with energies @xmath17 50  tev from the crab nebula , one deduces for this case that @xmath18tev , or that -@xmath19 .",
    "_ case ii : _ for this possibility , where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , electrons become superluminal if their energies exceed @xmath22 .",
    "electrons traveling faster than light will emit light at all frequencies by a process of ` vacuum erenkov radiation . '",
    "this process occurs rapidly , so that superluminal electron energies quickly approach @xmath23 .",
    "however , because electrons have been seen in the cosmic radiation with energies up to @xmath242  tev , it follows that @xmath25  tev , which leads to an upper limit on @xmath12 for this case of @xmath26 .",
    "note that this limit is two orders of magnitude weaker than the limit obtained for case i. however , this limit can be considerably improved by considering constraints obtained from studying the  spectra of active galaxies@xcite .",
    "a constraint on @xmath12 for @xmath27 follows from a change in the threshold energy for the pair production process @xmath28 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the square of the four - momentum is changed to give the threshold condition    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the energy of the low energy photon and @xmath31 is the angle between the two photons . the second term on the left - hand - side comes from the fact that @xmath32 .",
    "it follows that the condition for a significant increase in the energy threshold for pair production is @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 , or equivalently , @xmath36 .   the observed @xmath9-ray spectrum of the active galaxy mkn 501 while flaring extended to @xmath37 tev@xcite and exhibited the high energy absorption expected from @xmath9-ray annihilation by extragalactic pair - production interactions with extragalactic infrared photons@xcite",
    "this has led stecker and glashow@xcite to point out that the mkn 501 spectrum presents evidence for pair - production with no indication of liv up to a photon energy of @xmath2420  tev and to thereby place a quantitative constraint on liv given by @xmath38 , a factor of 30 better than that given in the previous section .",
    "_ glast _ will observe many more such active galaxies at different redshifts as shown in figure [ counts]@xcite and thereby further test such constraints on liv by looking for deviations from predicted absorption effects .",
    "figure [ taufam ] shows the optical depth of the universe to high energy   against pair production interactions for sources at various redshifts under the assumption that lorentz invariance holds@xcite .",
    "as previously mentioned , liv has been proposed to be a consequence of quantum gravity physics at the planck scale @xmath39 gev@xcite . in models involving large extra dimensions ,",
    "the energy scale at which gravity becomes strong can occur at a scale , @xmath40 , even approaching a tev@xcite . in the most commonly considered case ,",
    "the usual relativistic dispersion relations between energy and momentum of the photon and the electron are modified@xcite by a term of order @xmath41 .. ]    generalizing the liv parameter @xmath12 to an energy dependent form    @xmath42    the threshold condition from pair production implies @xmath43 since pair production occurs for energies of at least 20 tev , we find a constraint on the quantum gravity scale@xcite @xmath44 .",
    "this constraint contradicts the predictions of some proposed quantum gravity models involving large extra dimensions and smaller effective planck masses . in a variant model of ref .",
    ", the photon dispersion relation is changed , but not that of the electrons . in this case",
    ", we find the even stronger constraint @xmath45 . future studies of the spectra of active galaxies can extend these constraints on quantum gravity models .",
    "one possible manifestation of lorentz invariance violation , possibly from planck scale physics produced by quantum gravity effects , is a change in the energy - momentum dispersion relation of a free particle or a photon which may be of first order in @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the quantum gravity scale , usually assumed to be the planck scale@xcite . in a @xmath48 cosmology , where present observational data indicate that @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the resulting difference in the propagation times of two photons having an energy difference @xmath51 from a @xmath9-ray burst ( grb ) at a redshift @xmath52 will be    @xmath53    for a photon dispersion of the form @xmath54 ) , with @xmath4 being the usual low energy velocity of light@xcite . in other words , @xmath12 , as defined earlier , is given by @xmath55 .",
    "data on grb021206 for @xmath56 mev implies a value for @xmath57 gev@xcite .",
    "data from grb051221a have given a constraint @xmath58 gev@xcite .",
    "the dispersion effect will be smaller if the dispersion relation has a quadratic dependence on @xmath46 as suggested by effective field theory considerations@xcite .",
    "this will obviate the limits on @xmath47 given above .",
    "the possible effect of extra dimension models on   propagation has also been pointed out very recently@xcite .",
    "the _ glast _ satellite , ( see figure [ glast ] ) , with its covering an energy range from 10 kev to 25 mev and its _ large area telescope ( lat ) _ covering an energy range from 20 mev to @xmath59 gev , can study both grbs and flares from active galactic nuclei over a large range of both energy and distance .",
    "so our studies can be extended to _",
    "glast _ observations of grbs and blazar flares after the expected _ glast _ launch in the fall of 2007 .",
    "a possible model for quantizing space - time which has been actively investigated is _ loop quantum gravity _ ( see the review given in ref . and references therein . )",
    "a signature of this model is that the quantum nature of space - time can produce an intrinsic birefringence effect .",
    "this is because electromagnetic waves of opposite circular polarizations will propagate with different velocities , which leads to a rotation of linear polarization direction through the angle @xmath60t/2=\\xi                k^2 t/2m_{planck } \\label{rotation}\\ ] ] for a plane wave with wave - vector @xmath61@xcite .",
    "some astrophysical sources emit highly polarized radiation .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( [ rotation ] ) that the rotation angle is reduced by the large value of the planck mass .",
    "however , the small rotations given by equation ( [ rotation ] ) can add up over astronomical or cosmological distances to erase the polarization of the source emission .",
    "therefore , if polarization is seen in a distant source , it puts constraints on the parameter @xmath62 .",
    "observations of polarized radiation from distant sources can therefore be used to place an upper bound on @xmath62 .",
    "equation ( [ rotation ] ) indicates that the higher the wave number @xmath63 , the stronger the rotation effect will be .",
    "thus , the depolarizing effect of space - time induced birefringence will be most pronounced in the  energy range .",
    "it can also be seen that the this effect grows linearly with propoagation time . the best secure bound on this effect , @xmath64 ,",
    "was obtained using the observed 10% polarization of ultraviolet light from a distant galaxy@xcite .",
    "a few years ago , there was a report of strong linear polarization from the  burst grb021206 observed from the _ rhessi _ satellite@xcite .",
    "the survival of such polarization over cosmological distances would put a much stronger constraint on the value of the parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the constraint arises from the fact that if the angle of polarization rotation ( [ rotation ] ) were to differ by more than @xmath65 over the 0.1 - 0.3 mev energy range and by more than @xmath66 over the 0.1 - 0.5 mev energy range , the instantaneous polarization at the detector would fluctuate sufficiently for the net polarization of the signal to be suppressed well below the observed value .",
    "the difference in rotation angles for wave - vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 is @xmath69 replacing the time @xmath70 by the distance from the grb to the detector , denoted by @xmath71 .",
    "while the distance to grb021206 is unknown , it is well known that most cosmological bursts have redshifts in the range 1 - 2 corresponding to distances of greater than a gpc . using the distance distribution derived in ref .",
    "one can conservatively take the minimum distance to this burst as 0.5 gpc , corresponding to a redshift of @xmath72 .",
    "this yields the constraint @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the distance to the burst in units of 0.5 gpc@xcite .",
    "however , the polarization measurement reported in ref . has been questioned in other analyses@xcite and so remains controversial .",
    "it should be noted that the _ rhessi _ satellite detctor was not designed specifically to measure  polarization .",
    "detectors which are dedicated to polarization measurements in the x - ray and energy range and which can be flown in space to study the polarization from distant astronomical sources are now being designed@xcite .",
    "we note that linear polarization in x - ray flares from grbs has been predicted@xcite",
    ".    a further discussion of astrophyical constraints on liv may be found in ref ..",
    "the flux of ultrahigh energy nucleons is expected to be attenuated by photomeson producing interactions of these hadrons with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cbr ) .",
    "this predicted effect is now known as the `` gzk effect''@xcite .",
    "the mean - free - path for this attenuation effect is less than 100 mpc for cosmic ray nucleons of energy greater than 100 eev@xcite .",
    "coleman and glashow@xcite have shown that for interactions of protons with cbr photons of energy @xmath30 and temperature @xmath75 , pion production is kinematically forbidden and thus _ photomeson interactions are turned off _ if    @xmath76    thus , given even a very small amount of liv , photomeson interactions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) with the cosmic background radiation can be turned off .",
    "such a violation of lorentz invariance might be produced by planck scale effects@xcite .",
    "some `` trans - gzk '' hadronic showers with energies above the predicted `` cutoff energy '' ( usually considered to be 100 eev ) have been observed by both scintillator and fluorescence detectors , particularly by the scintillator array _",
    "group at akeno , japan@xcite , possibly in contradiction to the expected attenuation effect .",
    "while there is less evidence for such interesting events from fluorescence detectors ( see figure [ spec ] ) , we note that the _ fly s eye _ fluorescence detector reported the detection of a 320 eev event@xcite , an energy which is a factor of @xmath775 above the gzk cutoff energy .",
    "the subject of uhecrs having trans - gzk energies has not as yet been settled experimentally , even by the _",
    "pierre auger _",
    "ground - based detector array@xcite .",
    "if lorentz invariance violation is the explanation for a possibly missing gzk effect , indicated in the _ agasa _ data but not the _ hires _ data ( see figure [ spec]@xcite ) , one can also look for the absence of a `` pileup '' spectral feature and for the absence of the neutrinos which should be produced by the gzk effect .",
    "the detection of ultrahigh energy nucleons and neutrinos at sufficiently high energies and with excellent event statistics can best be done from space .",
    "this possibility will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the _ owl _ ( orbiting wide - field light - collectors ) mission is designed to obtain data on ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) and neutrinos in order to tackle the fundamental problems associated with their origin@xcite .",
    "the _ owl _",
    "mission is designed to provide the event statistics and extended energy range that are crucial to addressing these issues . to accomplish this , _ owl _ makes use of the earth s atmosphere as a huge  calorimeter \" to make stereoscopic measurements of the atmospheric uv fluorescence produced by air shower particles .",
    "this is the most accurate technique that has been developed for measuring the energy , arrival direction , and interaction characteristics of uhecr@xcite . to this end ,",
    "_ owl _ will consist of a pair of satellites placed in tandem in a low inclination , medium altitude orbit .",
    "the _ owl _ telescopes will point down at the earth and will together point at a section of atmosphere about the size of the state of texas ( @xmath78 km@xmath79 ) , obtaining a much greater sensitivity than present ground based detectors .",
    "the ability of _ owl _ to detect cosmic rays , in units of km@xmath79 sr , is called the _",
    "aperture_. the instantaneous aperture at the highest energies is @xmath80 km@xmath79 sr .",
    "the effective aperture , reduced by the effects of the moon , man - made light , and clouds , will be conservatively @xmath81 km@xmath79 sr .",
    "for each year of operation , _ owl _ will have 90 times the aperture of the ground based _ hires _ detector and 13 times the aperture of the _ pierre auger _ detector array ( 130 times its most sensitive  hybrid \" mode ) .",
    "the _ owl _ detectors will observe the uv fluorescence light from the giant air showers produced by uhecr on the dark side of the earth .",
    "they will thus produce a stereoscopic picture of the temporal and spatial development of the showers .    following a stacked dual launch on a delta rocket as shown in figure [ delta ]",
    ", the two satellites will fly in formation at an altitude of 1000 km and with a separation of 10 to 20 km for about 3 months to search for upward going showers from @xmath82 s propagating through the earth .",
    "the spacecraft will then separate to 600 km for @xmath77 2.5 years to measure the high - energy end of the uhecr spectrum . following this period ,",
    "the altitude is reduced to 600 km and the separation to 500 km in order to measure the cosmic ray flux closer to 10 eev .    with the fluorescence technique , a fast , highly pixelized camera ( or  eye \" ) is used to resolve both the spatial and temporal development of the shower .",
    "this detailed information provides a powerful tool for determining the nature of the primary particle .",
    "the uv emission , principally in the 300 to 400 nm range , is isotropic and the camera can view the shower from any direction , except almost directly toward the camera . in the exceptional case ,",
    "the camera may still be utilized as a cherenkov detector .",
    "thus , a single camera can view particles incident on the earth from a hemisphere of sky .    in monocular operation",
    ", precision measurements of the arrival times of uv photons from different parts of the shower track must be used to partly resolve spatial ambiguities .",
    "the angle of the shower relative to the viewing plane is resolvable using differential timing .",
    "resolving distance , however , requires that the pixel crossing time be measured to an accuracy that is virtually impossible to achieve in a real instrument at orbit altitudes .",
    "stereoscopic observation resolves both of these ambiguities . in stereo ,",
    "fast timing provides supplementary information to reduce systematics and improve the resolution of the arrival direction of the uhecr . by using stereo , differences in atmospheric absorption or scattering of the uv light can be determined .",
    "the results obtained by the _ hires _ collaboration viewing the same shower in both modes have clearly demonstrated the desirability of stereo viewing .",
    "the light collector will use a schmidt camera design as shown in figure [ schmidt ] .",
    "the schmidt corrector has a spherical front surface and an aspheric back surface , while the primary mirror has a slight aspheric figure .",
    "the focal plane is a spherical surface tiled with flat detector elements .",
    "the corrector is slightly domed for strength .",
    "the primary is made of lightweight composite material with a central octagonal section and eight petals that fold upward for launch .",
    "the entire optical system is covered by an inflatable light and micrometeoroid shield and is closed out by a redundant shutter system .",
    "the shield will be composed of a multi - layer material with kevlar layers for strength .",

    "owl_. one such monte carlo has been developed at the nasa goddard space flight center @xcite .",
    "the simulation employs a hadronic event generator that includes effects due to fluctuation in the shower starting point and shower development , charged pion decay , neutral pion interactions , and the lpm ( landau- migdal - pomeranchuk ) effect .",
    "the number of events detected by owl for a monoenergetic isotropic flux of protons and @xmath83 s with a standard model cross section is calculated by the monte carlo program , yielding the detection aperture as a function of energy , simulated trigger , and orbit parameters .",
