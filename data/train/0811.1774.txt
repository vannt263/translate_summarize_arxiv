    "shock waves are a common phenomenon in astrophysics , and have a profound impact on the energetics and distribution of gas in the interstellar and intergalactic medium ( mckee & hollenbach  1980 ; draine & mckee  1993 and references therein ) .",

    "recent observations have confirmed the existence of warm / hot gas , both in the local universe , and in more distant environments ( e.g.  tripp et al .",
    "2007 ; savage et al .  2005 ) .",
    "for example , savage et al .",
    "( 2005 ) reported on an absorption - line system at a redshift of @xmath10 , containing , , , , , , , and .",
    "they invoked an equilibrium two - phase model , in which most of the ions are created in a warm ( @xmath11  k ) photoionized cloud , while and are produced in a hotter ( @xmath12  k ) , collisionally ionized phase .",
    "the inferred temperature for the collisional phase is within the range of temperatures where departures from equilibrium are expected to be important ( gnat & sternberg 2007 ; hereafter gs07 ) .",
    "while observations have confirmed the existence of the warm / hot clouds , detailed theoretical modeling of the physical properties in the gas is needed to determine what fraction of baryons they harbor , and whether they confirm the theoretical predictions regarding the shock - heated whim ( furlanetto et al .",
    "investigating how the absorption line properties of fast radiative shock waves depend on gas metallicity is particularly interesting in the context of intergalactic shocks , as some of the whim absorbers are expected to have significantly subsolar metallicities ( e.g.  cen & ostriker  2006 ) .",
    "we focus on fast shocks , with velocities , @xmath13 , of @xmath0 and @xmath14  km  s@xmath2 , corresponding to post - shock temperatures , @xmath15 , of @xmath16 to @xmath17  k. after being heated by the shock , the gas emits energetic radiation which may later be absorbed by cooler gas further downstream , and by the unperturbed gas that is approaching the shock front .",
    "the shock self - radiation significantly affects the ionization states and thermal properties of the gas .    in following the time - dependent ion fractions",

    ", cooling can become rapid compared to ion - electron recombination .",
    "when recombination lags behind cooling the gas at any temperature tends to remain over - ionized compared to gas in collisional ionization equilibrium ( kafatos et al .",

    "we presented results for metal ionization states assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , as well as for the non - equilibrium ionization states that occur in radiatively cooling gas in which recombination lags behind cooling . here",
    "we extend our work to compute the integrated metal - ion column - densities produced in steady flows of gas , in the post - shock cooling layers behind fast shocks .",
    "the computations we present in this paper build upon the results we presented in gs07 .",
    "in addition to calculating the non - equilibrium ionization and cooling , we follow the dynamics of the cooling gas and the radiative transfer of the shock self - radiation through the post - shock cooling layers .",
    "we include the effects of photoionization and heating by the shock radiation , and also self - consistently compute the initial photoionization state of the precursor gas .",
    "the diagnostic characteristics of gas cooling behind steady shock waves have been studied by many authors dating back to cox  ( 1972 ) , dopita  ( 1976 ; 1977 ) and raymond  ( 1979 ) .",
    "these works computed the time - dependent ionization and cooling in the post - shock cooling layers .",
    "shull & mckee ( 1979 ) added a self - consistent computation of the ionization states in the radiative precursor produced by shock radiation emitted in the up - stream direction .",
    "all of these investigations considered intermediate or low - velocity shocks , with @xmath19  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "kang & shapiro ( 1992 ) considered shocks with @xmath13 up to 400 km s@xmath2 , for gas with primordial compositions . for slow shocks , the neutral fraction in the gas entering",
    "the shock may be considerable , and this significantly affects the thermal and dynamical evolution of the post - shock gas .",
    "the metal - line signatures of slow shocks differ significantly from those of faster shocks , both because collisional ionization and excitation behind cooler shocks are less efficient , and because the photoionizing self - radiation produced by the shocked gas is much less intense and less energetic .",
    "the observational signatures of fast shock waves ( @xmath20  km  s@xmath2 ) were initially studied by daltabuit , macalpine & cox ( 1978 ) , and binette et al .",
    "( 1985 ) assuming collisional ionization equilibrium , later by dopita & sutherland  ( 1995 ; 1996 ) , and more recently by allen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who explicitly followed the time - dependent ion fractions , and took into account the photoionization and heating of both the `` downstream '' gas and radiative precursor by the shock self - radiation .",
    "allen et al .",
    "present results for shocks with velocities between @xmath21 and @xmath22  km  s@xmath2 , and with magnetic field parameters @xmath23 between @xmath24 and @xmath25  @xmath26  @xmath27 .",
    "they considered five different heavy element abundance - sets , all with a roughly solar metals - to - hydrogen ratios .",
    "they presented results for the integrated metal column densities and resulting emission line properties .",
    "none of the previous discussions investigated how the cooling column densities depend on the overall metallicity of the shocked gas .",
    "for the @xmath0 and @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 shocks that we consider , we present a complete set of results for gas metallicities @xmath6 ranging from @xmath7 to twice the solar abundance of heavy elements .",
    "we investigate how the observational signatures of fast radiative shocks depend on @xmath6 .",
    "our emphasis is on the absorbing metal column densities that are produced in the post - shock cooling layers .",
    "we present computations for shocks in which the magnetic field is negligible ( @xmath5 ) so that the cooling occurs at approximately constant pressure ( isobaric ) , and for shocks in which the magnetic field dominates the pressure everywhere so that the gas cools at constant density ( isochoric ) .",
    "there are two key differences between isobaric and isochoric shocks that we discuss in detail in this paper .",
    "first , in isobaric flows the cooling times are shortened in the downstream gas due to the higher densities that obtain as the gas cools and compresses .",
    "this leads to a large suppression of the integrated columns densities of species that are produced mainly in the cooler parts of the flows , in isobaric versus isochoric shocks .",
    "second , the effects of photoionization by the shock radiation are much more important in isochoric shocks where the `` ionization parameters '' remain large because the gas densities do not grow as the radiation is absorbed .",
    "photoionization in isochoric shocks leads to increased ionization in the cooler downstream absorbing layers , over and above what is produced by recombination lags in the rapidly cooling gas .",
    "the magnitude of these effects is sensitive to the metallicity , via its control of the cooling rates and the associated shock self - radiation .    in our computations",
    "we make several simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we assume steady state , one dimensional , plane - parallel shocks . fast radiative shocks are known to be subject to thermal instabilities , both locally  where small inhomogeneities in the gas grow to produce clumps and create secondary shocks , and globally  where the shock velocity oscillates , thus affecting the dynamics of the flowing gas ( e.g.  draine & mckee  1993 ) .",
    "global shock instabilities are expected to occur for shock velocities in excess of @xmath28  km  s@xmath2 , based on both analytical ( e.g.  chevalier & imamura 1982 ; innes et al .  1987 ; innes  1992 ; toth & draine  1993 ) and numerical work ( e.g.  langer et al .  1981 ; gaetz et al .",
    "1988 ; toth & draine  1993 ; strickland & blondin  1995 ; sutherland et al .  2003 ; pittard et al .",
    "global oscillations of the shock velocity may affect the absorption and emission line signatures of the post - shock cooling gas , and it is unclear to what extent predictions based of steady - state shock models represent the complexity of real physical shocks .",
    "however , as noted by allen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , full three - dimensional models of unsteady and dynamically evolving shocks , including radiative transfer and time - dependent evolution of the ion fractions in the post - shock cooling layers is computationally very complex .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "here we construct steady - state one - dimensional models as approximations . in our steady state ,",
    "one - dimensional models , we self - consistently take into account the time dependent ionization , cooling , radiative transfer , and dynamics of the post - shock gas .",
    "second , we assume that the electron and ion temperatures are equal throughout the flow . recent observational evidence has suggested that in `` balmer - dominated '' shocks with @xmath29  km  s@xmath2 the electrons and ions emerge from the shock with different post - shock temperatures ( e.g.  ghavamian et al .",
    "2007 ) . in @xmath0 and @xmath14",
    "km  s@xmath2 shocks , ghavamian et al .",
    "estimate that the post - shock electron temperatures are @xmath30 and @xmath31 the proton post - shock temperatures .",
    "the validity of the standard electron - ion equipartition assumption has therefore been questioned ( chevalier et al .",
    "1980 ; ghavamian et al .  2001 , 2007 ; yoshida et al .  2005 ; heng & mccray  2007 ; heng et al .  2007 ; rakowski et al .",
    "2008 ; raymond et al .",
    "however , the electron - proton equipartition time @xmath32  years ( where @xmath33 is the electron density , and @xmath34  k , spitzer  1962 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2005 ) , is much shorter than the cooling times , @xmath35 ( gs07 ) , for the physical conditions that we consider , and any initial temperature difference will be rapidly removed .",
    "the electron and ion velocity distributions are therefore expected to remain closely coupled during the cooling process .",
    "for example , for solar metallicity ( @xmath36 ) , we estimate , conservatively , that for @xmath0 and @xmath14  km  s@xmath2 shocks the initial ratios of the equipartition to cooling times are @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively we set @xmath39 .",
    "this gives an upper bound on the equipartition time .",
    "in estimating @xmath40 we set @xmath41 equal to the initial electron temperature @xmath42 .",
    "this gives a lower bound on the cooling time .",
    "thus , for example , for a 600 km s@xmath2 shock , with @xmath43  k , and for which initially @xmath44 ( where @xmath45 is the proton temperature ) , and with @xmath46 , it follows that @xmath47  k. for these values of @xmath15 and @xmath42 our conservative estimates for the equipartition and cooling times are @xmath48 and @xmath49 years .",
    "this gives @xmath50 for @xmath36 . ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath51 is smaller for lower @xmath6 .",
    "we therefore assume @xmath52 everywhere .",
    "third , we assume that any initial dust is rapidly destroyed ( e.g.  by thermal sputtering ) after passing through the shock front , on a time scale that is much shorter than the cooling time .",
    "if a high dust mass can be maintained , cooling by gas - grain collisions may dominate the total cooling at high temperatures ( ostriker & silk  1973 ; draine  1981 ) .",
    "draine & mckee  ( 1993 ) estimate that as much as @xmath53 of the initial thermal energy may be radiated away before the grains are completely destroyed . even in this case , the integrated cooling column densities are only affected at a level of @xmath54 ( except for the highest ionization state of each element which may be affected by @xmath55 ) .",
    "more recently , the work of smith et al .  ( 1996 ) has suggested that the dust sputtering destruction time - scale is shorter than the cooling time when @xmath56  k. we consider higher shock temperatures , and assume that any dust is instantaneously destroyed .",
    "the post - shock gas then evolves with constant gas - phase elemental abundances as specified by the metallicity , @xmath6 .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we write down the equations of ionization , dynamics , cooling and heating , and radiative transfer that we solve in our computations . we also discuss our treatment of the initial ionization states in the gas approaching the shock front , and describe our numerical method . in ",

    "we discuss how the column densities depend on the gas metallicity , shock velocity , and magnetic field . in   7 we compute the equilibrium metal - ion column densities that are produced in the photoionized precursors of these fast radiative shocks .",

    "initially , the heating in the plateau is due to photoionization ( for @xmath209  @xmath76  s ) , then photoionization ( for @xmath210  @xmath76  s ) , and then by photoionization of metals , mostly by neutral oxygen ( for @xmath211  @xmath76  s ) .",

    "however , departures from exact thermal equilibrium enable the gas to cool further , down to a temperature of @xmath216  k at @xmath217  @xmath76  s.    as the gas cools , and the heating radiation is absorbed , the h and he preferentially absorb low energy photons , and the remaining ionizing radiation therefore becomes harder with increasing depth in the photoabsorption plateau .",
    "figure  [ isoc - ex]e shows that after the uv photons are absorbed ( at @xmath218  s ) , the heating rate decreases much more rapidly , and the cooling rate lags slightly behind the heating .",

    "differences between our results and those of allen et al .",
    "are likely due to differences in the assumed abundances , and in the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath91 .",

    "the cooling efficiency is roughly proportional to the gas metallicity .",
    "however , at lower gas metallicity , as the metal contribution to the cooling rate above @xmath205  k becomes negligible , the cooling efficiency approaches a limit set by the primordial helium abundance ( see boehringer & hensler  1989 ; gs07 ) .",

    "cooling times in isochoric flows is therefore sensitive to @xmath6 , as can be clearly seen in panel  ( a ) of figure  [ tt ] .",
    "the different cooling times also set the degree of non - equilibrium ionization in the gas ( gs07 ) , as affected by the ratio of the cooling - time and the ( metallicity - independent ) recombination time .",
