    "should we observe a qnm from a black hole and know also which particular normal mode we are observing we can determine , from the mode s frequency and damping time , the black hole mass and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , we observe several different qnms from the same source and find that they are inconsistent with the spectrum predicted by general relativity in the sense that they _ can not _ be explained by a single value of the mass and angular momentum we may infer that we are not observing a black hole . here",
    "we develop this observation into a experimental test of the existence of black holes or , alternatively , general relativity .",

    ", these compact objects can only be black holes .",
    "observations by lisa of qnms inconsistent with black holes would also be a test of the general relativistic no - hair theorem since an inconsistency in this mass range with black hole sources would indicate that physical scales other than mass and angular momentum were involved in the generation of the radiation .    in either sense the test described here is of general relativity based on gravitational wave observations .",

    "they investigated the polarization modes of gravitational waves in various metric theories of gravity and described how to identify the modes experimentally and use those observations to identify the spin content of dynamical gravity .",
    "the first actual test of general relativity relying on its prediction of the existence of gravitational waves was made by taylor and weisberg @xcite .",
    "they described how the observed orbit and orbit decay of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar psr b1913@xmath116 led to a strong consistency check on the predictions of general relativity .",
    "finn @xcite proposed a different test of the spin content of dynamical gravity , based on the possibility of a space - based detector in circumsolar orbit observing the induction - zone field associated with solar oscillations .",
    "ryan @xcite has outlined how observations of the gravitational radiation from capture orbits of solar mass compact bodies about a supermassive black hole may allow the determination of certain multipole moments of the central hole , thereby testing the prediction of general relativity . more recently ,",

    "the preceding tests can be grouped into three different classes .",
    "one set of tests , which includes @xcite , is based on energy conservation arguments : the observed evolution of a system or of the radiation from a system , is related to the energy loss expected owing to the radiation .",
    "a second class of tests , which includes @xcite , focuses on the observed polarization modes of the field .",
    "a third class , which includes @xcite , involves the frequency - dependent dispersion relationship associated with a massive graviton .",

    "damped sinusoidal motion is ubiquitous for systems approaching equilibrium and one expects that collapse or coalescence will lead , in any theory of gravity , to some form of qnm ringing .",
    "if we observe a qnm spectrum that is inconsistent with an isolated black hole , then there are two possibilities . on the one hand ,",
    "general relativity may yet be correct , but we are not observing an isolated black hole approaching equilibrium .",
    "similarly , we may be observing the radiation arising from a compact body that is not a black hole  e.g. , a neutron star @xcite , a boson star @xcite or strange matter star @xcite , whose qnm spectrum will be determined by the properties and configuration of the appropriate matter fields  or a black hole carrying a previously unknown macroscopic charge e.g. , a dilaton field @xcite",
    ". on the other hand , general relativity may not be the correct theory of gravity in the strong field limit .",
    "thus , while no single observation may rule out general relativity , a set of observations , each of a different source , _ none _ of which is consistent with an isolated black hole , could suggest the need to consider alternative theories of gravity in the strong - field limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ idealqnmsec ]",
    "we briefly describe the qnms of a kerr black hole and explain how the idealized observation of two or more modes in the absence of noise enables us to extract the mass and angular momentum of the black hole .",

    "following the aspherical collapse to a black hole , one expects that the final black hole can be described as the perturbation of a stationary kerr hole .",
    "the dominant part of the gravitational waves emitted as the black hole settles down can be described as a sum over a countably infinite set of damped sinusoids , each characterized by an amplitude , phase , frequency and damping time .",
    "( at still later times , the radiation will be dominated by power - law tails arising from the backscatter of radiation off the spacetime curvature in the neighborhood of the black hole @xcite ; however , here we are interested in the earlier , and higher amplitude , qnm ringing . ) in this sub - section we review those properties of the black hole qnm spectrum that are important for our investigation ; more detailed examinations of the spectrum itself can be found in @xcite .",

    "note that not all observations @xmath63 will lead to a non - empty confidence interval : i.e. , for some @xmath63 there will be no @xmath37 consistent with the observation .",
    "we frame our test in terms of the confidence interval we construct : if we make an observation @xmath63 for which there is no probability @xmath77 confidence interval , then we say that the observed normal modes are inconsistent with an isolated black hole with confidence @xmath77 .",
    "conversely , if there does exist a probability @xmath77 confidence interval , then we have verified that general relativity is self - consistent at this confidence level .",
    "finally , we should point out an aesthetic flaw of our choice of ordering principle .",
    "the function @xmath71 is a density and , therefore , not invariant under a reparameterization of @xmath69 .",
    "if we were to use a new parameter @xmath90 for some smooth monotonic function @xmath35 , the confidence region obtained for @xmath70 using a measurement of @xmath69 may not coincide with the region obtained using a measurement of @xmath91 . in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "there exists another ordering principle based on the likelihood ratio @xcite which is reparameterization invariant ; however , we have not been able to generalize this to higher dimensions . while aesthetically displeasing , there is nothing wrong with the choice we have made , which is natural given the physical association of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath16 with the black hole mass and angular momentum .",
    "the generalization to qnm observations is straightforward .",
    "each observation consists of @xmath56 complex qnm frequencies @xmath92 and associated amplitude signal - to - noise ratios @xmath93 , which characterize both the amplitude of the signal at that frequency and the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath92 ( cf.@xcite ) : @xmath94 for definiteness suppose that @xmath92 and @xmath93 are identified via maximum likelihood techniques @xcite . there is a minimum signal - to - noise associated with each mode , which is set by the requirement that the observation must identify @xmath56 modes .",
    "observations @xmath63 corresponding to a black hole characterized by @xmath37 and signal - to - noise @xmath95 are distributed according to the sampling distribution @xmath96 in general the sampling distribution depends upon the nature of the detector noise and the analysis procedure that identifies the modes @xmath52 . for large signal - to - noise ratios it will generally reduce to a multivariate gaussian in @xmath97 and @xmath98 and for smaller signal - to - noise ratios it can be determined via simulation .",

    "we have described a qualitatively new test of the existence of general relativistic black holes , based on the gravitational radiation they emit when they are formed or when they are impulsively excited , e.g. , through a merger event .",

    "the scale of the frequency and damping time measures the black hole mass and angular momentum .",
    "similarly , the relationship of the different modes to each other  i.e. , the spectrum  is unique to black holes .",
    "we have described here how this relationship can be used to test the proposition that observed gravitational waves , characteristic of an impulsively excited , damped source , in fact originate from a general relativistic black hole . such a test can be characterized in at least two different ways : as a definitive `` proof '' that a black hole has been observed , or as a test of the so - called `` no - hair '' theorem of general relativity .    to demonstrate the effectiveness of this test we have evaluated numerically the probability that the test will mistakenly fail to identify an actual black hole . by introducing a hypothetical gravitational wave source",
    "whose characteristic frequencies and damping times are similar to those of neutron star w - mode @xcite we have also evaluated numerically the probability that the test will incorrectly identify w - mode oscillations of a neutron star , or any object whose spectrum is similar to a black hole .",
    "together these results demonstrate that for sources with the signal - to - noise expected of , for example , massive black hole coalescences detected by lisa , the test proposed here can cleanly discriminate black hole sources .",
    "finally , we have shown that lisa can be expected to observe signals of this kind and strength throughout the universe with a rate that may be as great as 100/y .",
    "this method can be used to measure mass and angular momentum of a black hole .",
    "using gravitational waves to measure mass and angular momentum is an idea that has been around for some time @xcite . in these previous works",
    "it was assumed that the mode observed was of a known order ( e.g. , the mode with the longest damping time , or the lowest order , etc . ) . with the observation of two or more modes the requirement that a single mass and angular momentum explain the complete set likely permits the mass and angular momentum to be determined uniquely .",
    "the field of gravitational - wave detection is new .",
    "the current generation of ground- and space - based gravitational - wave detectors is opening a new frontier of physics : _ gravitational - wave phenomenology , _ or the use of gravitational wave observations to learn about the physics of gravitational - wave sources and gravity itself .",
    "we are only just beginning learn how to exploit the opportunities it is creating for us . as gravitational - wave observations mature , we can expect more and greater recognition of their utility as probes of the character of relativistic gravity .",
