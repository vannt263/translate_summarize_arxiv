    "a classical theme in the theory of stochastic differential equations is how stably the solution process behaves , as a functional of its integrand and integrator processes , see e.g.  @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  v.4 ) .",
    "a typical question is how to extend such a functional sensibly to a larger class of input processes .",
    "continuity is a key property to address such problems , cf .",
    "e.g.  in @xcite for his canonical extension of stratonovich  sdes . in singular control problems for instance",
    ", the non - linear objective functional may initially be only defined for finite variation or even absolutely continuous control strategies .",
    "existence of an optimizer might require a continuous extension of the functional to a more general class of controls , e.g.  semimartingale controls for the problem of hedging .",
    "herein the question of which topology to embrace arises , and this depends on the problem at hand , see e.g.  @xcite for an example of utility maximization in a frictionless financial market where the emery topology turns out to be useful for the existence of an optimal wealth process . for our application",
    "we need suitable topologies on the skorokhod space of cdlg functions .",
    "the two most common choices here are the uniform topology and skorokhod @xmath0 topology ( often just called `` the skorokhod topology '' ) ; they share the property that a jump in a limiting process can only be approximated by jumps of comparable size at the same time or , respectively , at nearby times . but this can be overly restrictive for such applications , as we have in mind , where a jump may be approximated sensibly by many small jumps in fast succession or by continuous processes such as wong - zakai - type approximations .",
    "the @xmath1 topology by skorokhod @xcite captures such approximations of _ unmatched jumps_. we refer to @xcite for a profound survey .",
    "our application context is that of an illiquid financial market for trading a single risky asset over potentially longer time horizons .",
    "a large investor s trading causes transient price impact on some exogenously given fundamental price which would prevail in a frictionless market .",
    "such could be seen as a convex ( non - proportional ) transaction cost with intertemporal impact also on subsequent prices .",
    "an original aspect of our model is that we consider multiplicative impact by a positive factor , which ensures that trading prices remain non - negative .",
    "in contrast , most models in the market impact literature assume additive price impact , which could offer a tractable approximation for some applications with short horizons . in comparison ,",
    "positivity of asset prices is desirable from a theoretical point of view , relevant for applications with longer time horizons ( as they may occur e.g.  for large institutional trades , cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite , or for hedging problems with longer maturities ) , and appears to fit better to common models with multiplicative price evolutions , as e.g.  black - scholes , cf .",

    "the large trader s feedback effect on prices causes the proceeds ( negative expenses ) to be a non - linear functional of her control strategy for dynamic trading in risky assets . choosing a seemingly sensible , but ad - hoc",
    ", definition could lead to surprising and undesirable consequences , in that the large investor can evade her liquidity costs entirely by using continuous finite variation strategies to approximate her target control strategy , cf .",
    "[ ex : ad - hoc definition of proceeds ] .",
    "optimal trade execution proceeds or superreplication prices may be only approximately attainable in such models ; indeed , a key insight from @xcite in this context has been that a notion of approximately realizable gains is relevant for the mathematical analysis of such models , cf .",

    "we contribute a systematic study on stability of the proceeds functional . starting with an unambiguous definition   for continuous finite - variation strategies , a mathematical challenge for stability of the stochastic integral functional",

    "stability in @xmath1 precludes the counterintuitive model behaviour mentioned above .",
    "a particular consequence is a wong - zakai approximation result , that could alternatively be shown by adapting results from @xcite on the marcus canonical equation to our setup , cf .",
    "[ sect : stability ] .",
    "another direct implication of @xmath1 continuity is that proceeds of general ( optimal ) strategies can be approximated by those of simple strategies with only small jumps .",
    "whereas the former property is typical for common stochastic integrals , it is far from obvious for our non - linear controlled sde functional .",
    "the topic of stability for the stochastic process of proceeds from dynamically trading risky assets in illiquid markets , where the dynamics of the wealth and of the proceeds for a large trader are non - linear in her strategies because of her market impact , is showing up at several places in the literature .",
    "but the mathematical topic appears to have been touched mostly in - passing so far .",
    "the focus of few notable investigations has been on the application context and on different topologies in distinctly different models of ( additive ) impact : see e.g.  ( * ? ? ? *",

    "in contrast , we contribute a study of @xmath1- , @xmath0- and ucp - stability for cdlg strategies in a price impact model of different kind with general multiplicative and transient impact , driven by quasi - left continuous martingales .    as a further contribution , and also to demonstrate the relevance and scope of the theoretical results , we discuss a variety of examples where continuity properties play a role . in [ ex : optimal monotone liquidation in finite horizon ] we establish existence of an optimal monotone liquidation strategy in finite time horizon using relative compactness and continuity of the proceeds functional in @xmath1 .",

    "this is easiest to explain in a one - sided lob , or with respect to monotone strategies .",
    "a market sell order eats into the bid side of an lob and is filled at respective prices , price impact being a function of the shape of some ( shadow ) lob ; but a certain fraction @xmath641 ( @xmath642 ) of that price impact is instantaneously recovered directly after the trade , while only the remaining @xmath616-fraction constitutes a transient impact that decays gradually over time . in the words by roch @xcite , this means that `` we think of @xmath641 as the fraction of the order book which is renewed after a market order so that in practice the actual impact on prices is @xmath616 times the full impact '' . in our previous model for a two - sided limit order book ( non - monotone strategies ) , with the idealizing assumption of bid - ask spread being zero , the model with full impact ( @xmath643 ) implicitly postulates that imbalances in the market impact ( or volume effect ) process and the resulting price impact are transient over time , but that the gap between bid and ask prices after a block buy ( resp .",
    "sell ) order is actually filled up instantaneously with ask ( resp .",
    "bid ) orders . for one - directional trading",
    "such hypothesis is conservative , but for trading in alternating directions it may be overly optimistic . to this end",

    "such can be incorporated as follows .",
    "let @xmath644 $ ] and suppose that the impact directly after completion of a block trade of size @xmath645 at time @xmath646 is actually @xmath647 , where @xmath648 is the market impact immediately before the trade .",
    "thus the parameter @xmath616 gives the proportion of new bid orders ( ask orders ) that fill up the bid - ask spread right after a market buy ( resp .",
    "sell ) order and corresponds to instantaneous partial recovery of the price . in this case",

    "note that @xmath652 corresponds to the case with no ( non - instantaneous ) impact while @xmath653 gives our setup so far of full impact .",
    "the situation when @xmath654 is more delicate . in this case executing a block order at once would always be suboptimal ; subdividing a block trade into two smaller block trades and executing them one after the other would lead to smaller expenses / larger preceeds due to the instantaneous partial recovery effect of the price impact .",
    "thus , there would be a difference between _ asymptotically realizable _ proceeds from a block trade ( in the terminology of @xcite ) and its direct proceeds from a lob interpretation .",
    "let us emphasize that asymptotically realizable proceeds should be given by a proceeds functional that is continuous in the skorokhod @xmath1 topology .",
    "motivated by optimization questions like the optimal trade execution problem where a trader would try to evade illiquidity costs from large ( block ) orders , if possible , our aim is to specify a model that is stable with respect to small intertemporal changes , in particular approximating block trades by subdividing the trade into smaller packages and executing them in shorter time intervals .",
