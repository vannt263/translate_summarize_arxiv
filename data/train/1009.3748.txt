    "a problem in many applications is that of sound generated by circular sources . these include rotors of various types such as aircraft propellers and fans , wind turbines and cooling fans ; vibrating systems such as loudspeakers ; ducts such as aircraft engines , ventilation systems and exhausts ; and distributed sources with axial symmetry such as jets .",
    "there have been numerous studies of the noise generation and radiation process in each of these areas extending over many decades .",
    "these studies can be divided into those which examine the relationship between the acoustic source and the physical processes which give rise to it , for example the work of lighthill  @xcite and of ffowcs williams and hawkings  @xcite which relate aerodynamic quantities to acoustic sources , and those which examine the radiated field generated by a given source distribution , such as methods for prediction of the field radiated by pistons and loudspeakers  @xcite or from a known rotating source distribution  @xcite .",
    "there are a number of areas where these issues , those of generation and radiation , overlap .",
    "one is the general area of source identification .",
    "there have been many attempts to develop methods which use acoustic measurements to infer , in greater or lesser detail , the source distribution responsible for the acoustic field . in the case of rotating sources",
    ", some examples include cooling fans  @xcite and propellers  @xcite , while a number of groups have developed methods for the inverse problem for radiation from a duct termination  @xcite .",
    "such studies can have a number of motivations .",
    "the first is to use near - field data , for example those taken in wind - tunnel tests , to predict the far acoustic field . in this case , the requirement is to extract information about source strength and directivity , but there is no need to know which processes generate the source .",
    "a second motivation , however , is the identification of the noisiest parts of the source with a view to reduction of noise at source , for example the identification of `` hot spots '' caused by unsteady loading on a cooling fan  @xcite . in this case , the link between the aerodynamics and the source is an essential part of the solution of the problem .    in each of the applications of source identification listed",
    ", the authors have recognized that the problem is ( very ) ill - conditioned .",
    "this can be attributed to physical causes , and is not merely an artifact of the methods used .",
    "recent analysis  @xcite has given a framework for the study of this ill - conditioning by quantifying the source information which is radiated into the acoustic near and far fields .",
    "as described below , it has been found that the source can be decomposed into orthogonal modes based on chebyshev polynomials , only a limited number of which radiate a detectable acoustic field , with the limit being fixed by the source frequency .    a second area where the issues of generation and radiation overlap is that of jet noise .",
    "lighthill s acoustic analogy  @xcite is accepted as an exact theory for noise generation by turbulence and there is solid evidence for the validity of his source term , as demonstrated by high quality numerical simulation  @xcite .",
    "this knowledge , however , is not sufficient to explain certain features of jet noise , in particular the low radiation efficiency of subsonic jets and the low order structure of the acoustic field .",
    "it is known that subsonic jets radiate only a small fraction of the source energy , a view given support by the very small changes in the flow which suffice to give large reductions in noise , when control is applied  @xcite .",
    "it is also known that the acoustic far field of a jet is significantly simpler than the flow field . in a recent study  @xcite ,",
    "modal decomposition of the far - field noise and of the flow field of a mach  0.9 jet showed that  24 modes were sufficient to capture  90% of the energy of the acoustic field , but  350 were required to resolve  50% of the flow energy .",
    "clearly , a very large part of the flow , however energetic it might be , simply does not radiate but it is not obvious if this is due to the nature of the source or purely a result of radiation effects .    the radiation effect has been explained in terms of source cancellation  @xcite and by viewing the radiation process as equivalent to the imposition of a spatial filter using a wavenumber criterion . such an approach has been used by freund  @xcite who found that the part of the source which radiates is indeed that part left over after applying an appropriate spatial filter .",
    "similarly , sinayoko and agarwal  @xcite apply a linear convolution filter to decompose the flow into radiating and non - radiating parts .",
    "the analysis to be presented below attempts to explain some of these features .",
    "previous work  @xcite has found limits on the information radiated from a tonal circular source , motivated by a desire to understand the ill - conditioning of source identification methods .",
    "these limits have been found without recourse to a far - field approximation , making the approach suitable for analysis of general problems .",
    "the remainder of this paper contains an extension of the theory to explicitly include the radial source term , and to yield spectral quantities in the acoustic field of random sources .",
    "the first extension , which can be viewed as a generalization of previous work on axisymmetric radiators  @xcite , will help explain radial cancellation effects , which have been studied in jet noise using a far - field formulation  @xcite but not , to the author s knowledge , in the near field .",
    "it will be found that for a given azimuthal order , many different sources radiate identical acoustic fields , differing only by a scaling factor .",
    "this result is part of the explanation for the ill - conditioning of identification methods and also opens a possible approach to the development of control systems by identifying a class of sources which can give rise to practically identical acoustic fields .    the second extension , to predicting the cross - spectrum between the acoustic pressures radiated by a random source to arbitrary points in the near and/or far field , is an extension of an earlier ring - source model for radiation from random sources characteristic of jets  @xcite .",
    "in this case , it will be found that the cross - spectrum depends on four constants , functions of observer radial separation , which are weighted integrals of the source cross - spectrum .",
    "the results to be presented arise from two different exact theories for radiation from circular sources  @xcite which are combined to give a formulation for the information in the acoustic field in terms of radiation functions and weighted integrals of the source term .",
    "the implications of the results are discussed in terms of the information content of the acoustic field and with regard to some of the measurement methods used to study noise sources .",
    "the problem is initially formulated as that of calculating the acoustic field radiated by a monopole source distributed over a circular disk . the system for the analysis",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : coordinate ] with cylindrical coordinates @xmath0 for the observer and @xmath1 for the source .",
    "all lengths are non - dimensionalized on disk radius .",
    "the field from one azimuthal mode of the acoustic source , specified as @xmath2 $ ] , has the form @xmath3 $ ] , with @xmath4 given by the rayleigh integral  @xcite : @xmath5^{1/2},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is non - dimensional wavenumber ( helmholtz number ) .",
    "the analysis of the nature of the sound field from an arbitrary disk source is based on a transformation of the disk to an exactly equivalent line source , an approach which has been used to study transient radiation from pistons  @xcite , rotor noise  @xcite and source identification methods  @xcite .",
    "the transformation to a line source is shown in figure  [ fig : sideline ] , which shows the new coordinate system @xmath7 centred on a sideline of constant radius @xmath8 . under this transformation : @xmath9 for observer positions with @xmath10 , with the limits of integration given by : @xmath11 functions of the form of @xmath12 have been analyzed in previous work  @xcite and can be written : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a chebyshev polynomial of the second kind , @xmath15 and the coefficients @xmath16 are functions of @xmath8 but not of @xmath17 . inserting equation  [ equ : kfunc : exp ] into equation  [ equ : transformed ] : @xmath18^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radiation properties of the integral of equation  [ equ : lfunc ] have been examined in some detail elsewhere  @xcite , giving an exact result for the in - plane case @xmath19 : @xmath20 for large order @xmath21 , the bessel function @xmath22 is exponentially small for @xmath23 so that the line source modes with order @xmath24 generate noise fields of exponentially small amplitude . since the integrals have their maximum in the plane @xmath19 , equation  [ equ : line : series ] says that the whole field is of exponentially small amplitude .",
    "this gives an indication of how much of a given source distribution radiates into the acoustic field , near or far .    in previous analyses ,",
    "two approximations to @xmath25 have been developed .",
    "one is an asymptotic formula valid in the limit @xmath26 , derived using the method of stationary phase  @xcite .",
    "this will not be required here , but we will make use of the far - field form of equation  [ equ : lfunc ] : @xmath27,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath29 .    given the basic information about the form of the radiated field , there remains to establish the relationship between the radial structure of the source @xmath30 and the line source coefficients @xmath16 .",
    "a recently derived series  @xcite for the field radiated by a ring source of radius @xmath31 can be used to find a second expression for the sound radiated by a disk source with arbitrary radial variation : @xmath32 with @xmath33 the hankel function of the first kind of order @xmath34 , @xmath35 the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath36 the associated legendre function .",

    "an alternative analysis which is widely used in radiation prediction uses the far field approximations @xmath81 , @xmath82 . on this approximation : @xmath83 so that the radiated field is given by a hankel transform of the radial source , with a dependence on the polar angle @xmath84 . in some sense , this can also be viewed as fixing a limit on the radiated information as in , for example , the use of ring sources to study coherence effects on jet noise  @xcite , or as a spatial filter .",
    "the approach suffers , however , from its inability to give information on the structure of the near field which might be of use in understanding such experimental methods as near - field to far - field correlations  @xcite .",

    "the second point is that the line source approach gives very good results , even for @xmath121 where , in principle , the approximation used should start to break down . finally ,",
    "although computational efficiency is not the primary aim of the method , we note that the line source approach converts the four dimensional integral , equation  [ equ : xspec:2 ] , required at each field point , into four two - dimensional integrals which are functions of radial separation only , equation  [ equ : uij ] , and four one - dimensional integrals @xmath122 , giving a large saving in calculation time .",
