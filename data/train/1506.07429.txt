    "entanglement plays a central role in quantum information processing and is increasingly seen as a valuable resource for distributed tasks such as unconditionally secure cryptography  @xcite , randomness certification  @xcite and expansion  @xcite .",
    "given such a scenario it is interesting to understand how much and what kind of entanglement needs to be employed in an optimal entangled strategy .",
    "as is commonly done , we study these questions within the framework of nonlocal games . in the computer science community nonlocal games",

    "is specified by four finite sets @xmath0 , a probability distribution @xmath1 on @xmath2 and a boolean predicate @xmath3 .",

    "the players respond with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the players have knowledge of the distribution @xmath1 and the predicate @xmath9 and can agree on a common strategy before the start of the game , but they are not allowed to communicate after they receive their questions .",
    "we say the players _ win _ the game if @xmath10 .",
    "a strategy is called _ perfect _ if it allows the players to win the game with probability one .",
    "the goal of alice and bob is to maximize their probability of winning the game .",
    "the _ classical value _ of a game @xmath11 , denoted @xmath12 , is the maximum expected winning probability when the players use deterministic strategies .",
    "an entangled strategy for a nonlocal game allows the players to determine their answers by performing joint measurements on a shared finite - dimensional entangled state .",
    "the _ entangled value _ of a game @xmath11 , denoted @xmath13 , is the supremum expected winning probability the players can achieve using entangled strategies .    despite significant efforts , many fundamental questions concerning the properties of the entangled value have so far remained beyond reach :    * * the computability question : * determine ( or upper bound ) the computational complexity of @xmath13 . * * the attainability question : * determine if @xmath13 can always be attained . * * the resources question : * how much and what kind of entanglement is needed to achieve @xmath13 .",
    "the above questions are understood only for some very special classes of games .",
    "one notable example is the class of xor games ; for these games the answer sets , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are binary and the verification predicate only depends on the xor of the player s answers . for xor games",
    "the entangled value can be formulated as a semidefinite program which can be approximated within arbitrary precision in polynomial time .",
    "furthermore , the entangled value of an xor game is always attained by a maximally entangled state  @xcite .    at present , there has only been sporadic progress for other classes of nonlocal games .",

    "+ _ question : _ does @xmath11 admit a perfect @xmath17 strategy ?    the study of @xmath18 is motivated by the following considerations .",
    "firstly , given the impasse on the general question of deciding whether a nonlocal game admits a perfect strategy , @xmath18 can be viewed as an even further restricted variant of @xmath16 that can hopefully provide useful insights into the general problem .",
    "secondly , to the best of our knowledge , there are no known examples of nonlocal games that admit perfect strategies but can not be won perfectly using @xmath17 strategies .",
    "thus , @xmath17 strategies might even be sufficient to reach success probability one ( whenever this can be done using some quantum strategy ) which would imply that @xmath16 is in fact equivalent to @xmath18 .",
    "we note that the situation is quite different when one considers non - perfect strategies .",
    "specifically , there are examples of nonlocal games whose entangled value is strictly smaller than one and for which maximally entangled states do not suffice to achieve the optimal success probability , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the decision problem @xmath18 has also been considered by ji  @xcite . similarly to @xcite , in this work ji shows how one can associate to any nonlocal game @xmath11 a polynomial system in non - commuting operator variables with the property that @xmath11 admits a perfect @xmath17 strategy if and only if the corresponding system has a solution in self - adjoint operator variables . using this reduction he proceeds to show that @xmath18 is np - hard already when the input is restricted to be the bcs game corresponding to the 3-sat problem .",
    "our main result in this work is given in where we identify independent set games as being the _ hardest instances _ of @xmath18 . in the _ @xmath19-independent set game _",
    "the players aim to convince a verifier that a graph @xmath20 contains an independent set of size @xmath21 ( _ i.e. _ , a set of @xmath21 pairwise nonadjacent vertices ) .",
    "to play the game the verifier selects uniformly at random a pair of indices @xmath22\\times [ t]$ ] and sends @xmath23 to alice and @xmath24 to bob . the players respond with vertices @xmath25 respectively . in order to win ,",

    "if they receive @xmath26 $ ] they need to respond with nonadjacent ( and distinct ) vertices of @xmath20 .",
    "the second decision problem relevant to this work is @xmath16 where the input is restricted to be an independent set game .    `",

    "all instances of ` q - independence ` can be identified with instances of ` perfect - pme ` and thus our first result can be understood as identifying ` q - independence ` to be among the most expressive subproblems of ` perfect - pme ` .",
    "as an immediate consequence of our first result and the discussion in the previous paragraph it follows that ` perfect - pme ` is decidable if and only if @xmath28 is decidable .",
    "currently , it is not known whether ` q - independence ` is decidable .",
    "nevertheless , reducing the decidability question from arbitrary games to the special class of independent set games allows to narrow down our focus to this specific class of games for which it might be easier to make progress on the decidability question .",
    "the proof of result 1 consists of two steps which we now briefly describe .",
    "we first need to introduce some definitions .",
    "a nonlocal game is called _ synchronous _ if it satisfies the following three requirements : _ ( i ) _ alice and bob share the same question set @xmath29 and answer set @xmath14 , _ ( ii ) _",
    "@xmath30 for all @xmath31 , and _",
    "@xmath32 for all @xmath31 and all @xmath33 .",
    "notice that the @xmath19-independent set game defined above is an example of a synchronous nonlocal game .",
    "the second decision problem of interest in this paper is a variation of @xmath16 where the input is restricted to be a synchronous game :    ` perfect - syn ` + _ instance : _ a synchronous nonlocal game @xmath11 .",
    "+ _ question : _ does @xmath11 admit a perfect quantum strategy ?    in we show that any synchronous game that admits a perfect quantum strategy also has a perfect @xmath17 strategy .",
    "notice that this implies that ` perfect - syn ` is a subproblem of ` perfect - pme ` .",
    "the first step in proving result 1 is where we show that ` perfect - pme ` is polynomial - time reducible to ` perfect - syn ` . to achieve this we extend any nonlocal game @xmath11 to a synchronous game @xmath34 where we can also ask alice any of bob s questions and vice versa ( see ) . the extended game @xmath34 has the property that @xmath11 has a perfect @xmath17 strategy if and only if @xmath34 has a perfect strategy .",
    "the second step in proving result 1 is where we show that ` perfect - syn ` is polynomial - time reducible to ` q - independence ` . to achieve this , to any synchronous game @xmath11 we associate an undirected graph @xmath35 ( see ) and",
    "show that @xmath11 admits a perfect entangled strategy if and only if the @xmath36-independent set game has a perfect strategy ( where @xmath29 denotes the question set of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we note that following the completion of this work it was communicated to us by ji that building on his recent results in @xcite he has independently obtained result 1 .",
    "the proof of this fact has not been published but can be derived by appropriately combining the results in @xcite together with two additional reductions ( that are not stated in @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to @xcite our approach is constructive and the final instance of ` q - independence ` is given explicitly in terms of the instance of ` perfect - pme ` .    as was already mentioned",
    "it is currently not known whether the entangled value of a nonlocal game ( with finite question and answer sets ) is always attained by some entangled strategy .",
    "in fact , there is evidence that this might not be true .",
    "the first example of a nonlocal game with answer sets of _ infinite _",
    "cardinality for which the entangled value is only attained in the limit was identified recently in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the attainability question restricted to perfect strategies for symmetric synchronous nonlocal games .",
    "a synchronous game is called _ symmetric _ if interchanging the roles of the players does not affect the value of the boolean predicate ( _ cf . _ ) .",
    "we note that all games of relevance to this work ( e.g. homomorphism ) are in fact symmetric . in we",
    "show that independent set games again capture the hardness of the attainability question for symmetric games .",
    "* result 2 : * _ suppose that every independent set game @xmath11 satisfying @xmath37 admits a perfect entangled strategy",
    ". then the same holds for all symmetric synchronous nonlocal games .",
    "_    to obtain our second result we show that vanishing - error strategies for a symmetric synchronous game @xmath11 give rise to vanishing - error strategies for an appropriate independent set game defined in terms of the game graph of  @xmath11 . notice that since independent set games are synchronous , our second result can be understood as identifying a class of synchronous games which captures the hardness of the attainability question for perfect strategies for the entire class of symmetric synchronous nonlocal games .",
    "nevertheless , we note that presently we do not know whether independent set games satisfy the assumption of result 2 .",
    "a number of interesting results have been derived recently concerning the interplay between the theory of graphs and nonlocal games , e.g. @xcite . in",
