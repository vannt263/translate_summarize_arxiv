    "supernova ( sn ) neutrinos continue to be a subject of great interest in astroparticle physics @xcite .",
    "in particular , renewed attention is being paid to collective features of flavor transformations induced by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) self - interactions ( see @xcite and refs .  therein ) .",
    "the observed collective phenomena of synchronized @xcite and bipolar @xcite oscillations , and the split of @xmath0 spectra @xcite can be largely understood , in flavor space , in terms of various alignment ( or antialignment ) ansatzes for the bloch polarization vectors of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) at different energy @xmath4 .",
    "conversely , lack of alignment indicates flavor decoherence @xcite .    in this work we deal with a minor  yet interesting",
    " phenomenon previously observed in the numerical experiments of @xcite and then of @xcite , akin to a low - energy `` antineutrino spectral split '' in inverted hierarchy .",
    "differently from the neutrino case , this feature appears to have a nonadiabatic origin .",
    "we show that the @xmath1 spectral split observed in @xcite can be approximately described in terms of @xmath2 and @xmath3 alignment along four global modes ( at low and high energy , for @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also discuss a scenario with different input spectra , where the @xmath1 split is slightly more evident , at least in the approximation of averaged trajectories .",
    "the effects described herein might play a role , in principle , in future low - energy sn neutrino observations via @xmath5 scattering .",
    "as in @xcite , we consider an effective two - flavor @xmath6 scenario with mass - mixing parameters @xmath7 . after",
    "trajectory averaging ( single - angle approximation ) , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes obey the equations of motion ( eom ) @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the vacuum oscillation frequency , @xmath10 is the matter potential related to the @xmath11 density ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13 is the neutrino - neutrino potential related to the effective @xmath0 and @xmath1 densities ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 , where the upper ( lower ) sign refers to normal ( inverted ) hierarchy . only the latter case will be considered hereafter .",
    "global polarization vectors are defined as integrals weighted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 spectral densities ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) @xcite @xmath19 and their difference provides the vector @xmath20 .",
    "numerically , we take @xmath21  ev@xmath22 , so that @xmath23=\\frac{5.07}{e~[\\mathrm{mev}]}\\ .\\ ] ] we also assume @xmath24 as reference value .",
    "it is then @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being a constant of motion @xcite . concerning the potentials @xmath27 and @xmath28 , their radial profile above the neutrinosphere @xmath29 are taken as in @xcite and shown in fig .  1 .",
    "figure  2 shows typical results at the end of collective flavor transformations in inverted hierarchy ( not much happens in normal hierarchy ) , as obtained by solving eqs .",
    "( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) with the same initial conditions as in @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature in fig .",
    "2 is the @xmath0 spectral split in the left panel at a critical energy @xmath30  mev , but a `` minor '' @xmath1 spectral split is also visible in the right panel of fig .  2 @xcite at @xmath31 , as observed in @xcite .",
    "a similar minor feature has been later observed as a small low - energy `` shoulder '' @xcite or `` bump '' @xcite in the final @xmath1 spectra .",
    "in general , numerical solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) can be partly understood via appropriate `` alignment '' ansatzes for @xmath2 and @xmath3 modes .",
    "in particular , for large @xmath28 , one can posit that they are separately pinned to their sum ( i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) @xcite . the eom for @xmath34 and @xmath35 can then be cast in a closed form , formally equivalent to the eom of a gyroscopic pendulum @xcite , which elegantly explains the so - called synchronized and bipolar oscillations observed in numerical experiments @xcite . alternatively , for slowly varying ( adiabatic ) @xmath28 , one can posit alignment with the hamiltonians in eqs .",
    "( [ eom1],[eom2 ] ) : @xmath36 and @xmath37 , explaining nicely @xcite the so - called @xmath0 spectral split @xcite .",
    "the above two ansatzes are , in part , exclusive .",
    "the `` pendulum '' solution describes well the synchronized and bipolar oscillation phases , but not the final @xmath0 spectral split .",
    "conversely , while the adiabatic solution describes well overall flavor evolution features , but not the transient , nonadiabatic bipolar oscillations .",
    "however , neither describe the low - energy @xmath1 spectral split of fig .",
    "this phenomenon must thus be related to the breaking of global alignment and of adiabaticity .",
    "adiabaticity breaking is expected in our scenario , especially at low @xmath4 .",
    "according to the criterion proposed in @xcite ( which is independent of both @xmath38 and @xmath27 ) , the evolution becomes nonadiabatic when the value of @xmath28 approaches a typical vacuum frequency @xmath39 . for @xmath40  mev ( fig .",
    "2 ) , the nonadiabaticity criterion is roughly @xmath41  km@xmath42 , and is satisfied at any radius @xmath43 in fig .  1 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath28 is a decreasing function of @xmath43 , adiabaticity is violated more at high @xmath39 ( low @xmath4 ) .",
    "however , we have not been able to sharpen this qualitative expectation and to `` predict , '' for instance , the observed value of the @xmath1 critical energy @xmath44 in terms of a specific transition to nonadiabaticity .",
    "for instance , we find that @xmath31 depends also on @xmath38 and @xmath27 ; e.g. , it decreases by @xmath45  mev by switching off the matter term @xmath27 , but is restored to @xmath46  mev for @xmath47 at @xmath48 .",
    "numerical observations thus suggest that the origin of the @xmath31 value is linked to the complex dynamics close to the @xmath49 axis , which can be rather subtle .    here",
    "we adopt a pragmatic approach , and take @xmath50 and @xmath31 from the numerical experiment at face value .",
    "our main observation is that these energies naturally separate `` low '' ( @xmath51 ) and `` high '' ( @xmath52 ) energy modes , and that these modes appear to be separately pinned to their global sum .",
    "more precisely , we define four new global vectors by splitting the energy intervals in eqs .",
    "( [ j],[jbar ] ) as @xmath53 \\cup [ e_c,\\infty]$ ] for @xmath0 and @xmath54\\cup [ \\overline e_c,\\infty]$ ] for @xmath1 , @xmath55 we find that the moduli of the above vectors ( @xmath56 , etc . )",
    "are approximately conserved during the evolution .",
    "figure  3 shows , for each of the four vectors defined above , both the modulus and the @xmath57-component as a function of @xmath43 .",
    "the initial moduli , calculated for @xmath58  mev and @xmath59  mev , are : @xmath60    such values do not change much with @xmath43 , despite the fact that the four vectors , initially aligned in the synchronized phase ( @xmath61  km ) , spread apart and nutate during the bipolar phase ( @xmath62  km ) and finally split up with low - energy ( high - energy ) modes aligned ( antialigned ) with the @xmath49 axis , corresponding to no ( full ) flavor conversion .",
    "a posteriori , this behavior is equivalent to posit the ( approximate ) alignment ansatz : @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and similarly for antineutrinos .",
    "consistency of this ansatz with conservation of @xmath67 from the initial ( aligned ) state to the final ( split ) state requires @xmath68 namely , @xmath69 which , in our case , is fulfilled within a few % @xcite . the fact that the flavor evolution in fig .",
    "3 is reasonably described by such an ansatz is a clear signal of deviations from the purely adiabatic solution , which would instead predict an alignment of the @xmath2 s and @xmath3 s to linear combinations of @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite , which we do not observe . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that @xmath50 may change somewhat with @xmath43 in the adiabatic solution @xcite ( while we have assumed @xmath43-independent @xmath50 and @xmath31 values a priori ) suggests that our ansatz , despite its effectiveness , may be further refined .",
    "summarizing , the global flavor evolution in our scenario appears to be effectively described in terms of four vectors with nearly conserved lengths , collecting @xmath0 energy modes below and above a critical value @xmath50 , and @xmath1 modes below and above a ( lower ) critical @xmath31 .",
    "it is then useful to check if the behavior in fig .  3",
    "is also captured by the solutions of eom reduced to _ exactly _ four modes , namely , @xmath72 where the four frequencies are defined as averages of @xmath39 ( with weights @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively @xcite ) in the corresponding energy ranges ( @xmath75 $ ] for @xmath76 , etc . ) .",
    "numerically , in our case : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ( all in km@xmath42 ) .",
    "the initial conditions correspond to alignment of all vectors to @xmath81 , with moduli given by eqs .",
    "( [ mod1],[mod2 ] ) .",
    "such moduli are trivially conserved by construction .",
    "the @xmath57-components are more interesting , and evolve in a way rather similar to those in fig .",
    "3 ( not shown ) . in particular , since conservation of @xmath67 prevails over exact alignment , the vectors @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) are almost  but not exactly  aligned ( antialigned ) to @xmath81 . therefore ,",
    "even this simplified ( 4-mode ) case shows an `` antineutrino spectral split '' to a good approximation , via the opposite behavior of @xmath83 and @xmath85 , similar to the results of the complete ( 100-mode ) spectral case shown in figs .  2 and 3 .",
    "we conclude by discussing the tiny effect of ordinary mikheev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) nonadiabatic resonances in matter for very low energy @xmath1 modes . in our scenario",
    "( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) the @xmath1 msw resonance condition @xmath88 ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) approximately reads @xmath90 this condition is met before the end of collective effects ( @xmath91  km ) for @xmath92  km@xmath42 ( @xmath93  mev ) , see fig .  1 . when passing from @xmath94 ( initial state @xmath95 ) to @xmath96 ( final state @xmath97 ) through the resonance , the @xmath98 flavor survives with probability @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the level crossing probability @xcite .",
    "the relation between @xmath101 and the @xmath57-components of the @xmath1 polarization vectors @xmath102 @xcite provides the depth of the msw resonance as @xmath103 figure  4 shows the radial profile of @xmath104 , as obtained in our numerical experiment for three representative ( very low ) energies . the radius and depth of the msw resonance agree with eqs .",
    "( [ res ] ) and ( [ depth ] ) , respectively .",
    "the lower the energy , the deeper the resonance , the more inverted is the final polarization vector @xmath105 . however",
    ", the non - collective ( @xmath106 ) msw effect is limited to such low energies to be practically unobservable in fig .  2 , and is numerically irrelevant for the 4-mode approximation described above . finally , we mention that , in _",
    "normal _ hierarchy , we find that the spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are basically unaffected by self - interaction effects , the only tiny change being a spectral swap of _ neutrinos _ for @xmath107  mev , induced by msw effects ( not shown ) .",
    "so far we have examined in detail the low @xmath4 features of the same scenario of @xcite in single - angle approximation .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , however , that the features in fig .  2 ( most notably the @xmath108 spectral split ) may be smeared out in more realistic ( `` multi - angle '' @xcite ) numerical experiments accounting for different ( unaveraged ) trajectory angles .    here",
    "we study the transition from single- to multi - angle simulations in a ( hypothetically ) more favorable scenario , where @xmath109 is decreased from 24 mev to 18 mev  everything else being unchanged .",
    "this choice , due to a `` fatter '' low - energy tail , leads to a slightly more prominent @xmath1 split at higher-@xmath31 , as evident in the single - angle results of fig .",
    "5 ( to be compared with fig .  2 ) .    concerning the reduction to four modes",
    ", we find that the case in fig .",
    "5 is well described by @xmath110  mev , @xmath111  mev , and : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "the corresponding frequencies are : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 ( in km@xmath42 ) .    concerning the transition from single- to multi - angle calculation , however , we find again that the latter tend to smear out the low - energy spectral features . figure  6 ( multi - angle ) shows , in comparison with fig",
    ".  2 ( single - angle ) that : ( 1 ) the @xmath0 split is broadened , and ( 2 ) the @xmath120 one is largely suppressed , and survives as a slight low - energy `` shoulder . '' at present , this ( unfavorable ) numerical observation @xcite remains analytically unexplained .",
    "one can not exclude , however , that the @xmath1 spectral split feature may be less suppressed in other multi - angle cases , whose investigation is left to future work .",
    "we have studied some low - energy features of the @xmath1 energy spectrum , focusing on the spectral split phenomenon emerging ( in inverted hierarchy ) in single - angle simulations .",
    "we have related its origin to nonadiabatic aspects of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 evolution , which can be simply modeled through an alignment ansatz with four energy modes .",
    "however , the @xmath1 split feature appears to be fragile when passing to multi - angle simulations .",
    "further studies are required to deepen its analytical understanding , as well as the conditions for its observability .",
