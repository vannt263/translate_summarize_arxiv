    "the two neutron - capture processes , i.e. the ( slow ) s - process and the ( rapid ) r - process , occur under different physical conditions and are therefore likely to arise in different astrophysical sites .",
    "the dominant site of the s - process is thought to be the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase in low- and intermediate - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the site or sites of the r - process are not known , although suggestions include the @xmath1-driven wind of type ii supernovae @xcite , the mergers of neutron stars @xcite , accretion - induced collapse ( aic ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and type 1.5 supernovae @xcite .",
    "the neutron - capture elements are composed of some pure r - process , some pure s - process , and some mixed - parentage isotopes . as a result ,",
    "when the solar system s abundances are separated into the contributions from the s - process and the r - process , some elements are mostly contributed by the r - process , such as eu , and some by the s - process , such as ba .",
    "therefore , eu is commonly referred to as an `` r - process element '' , and ba as an `` s - process element '' .",
    "observations for metal - poor stars with metallicities lower than [ fe / h ] @xmath2 enriched in neutron - capture elements have revealed the solar r - process pattern , while only a few cases of highly r - process - enhanced stars ( hereafter  r - ii  stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been noted . despite their considerable metal deficiency ,",
    "these stars seem to have experienced an r - process that barely differs from the sum of r - processes that enriched the pre - solar nebula . this has led to suggestions that r - process production may be independent of the initial metallicity of the site , especially for the heavier n - capture elements ( @xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is puzzling that several stars show enhancements of both r - process and s - process elements ( r+s stars hereafter ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as they require pollution from both an agb star and a supernova .",
    "the origin of the abundance peculiarities of the r+s stars is not clear , and many scenarios have been presented @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a scenario for the creation of r+s stars .",
    "firstly , some s - process material is accreted from an agb star , which turns into a white dwarf , then , during the evolution of the system , the white dwarf accretes matter from the polluted star and suffers an aic to a neutron star .",
    "the @xmath1-driven wind produces an r - process , which also pollutes the companion .",
    "a possible problem , as these authors mentioned , is the still uncertain nucleosynthesis in accretion - induced collapse , which may or may not produce the r - process .",
    "another possible r+s scenario is that the agb star transfers s - rich matter to the observed star but does not suffer a large mass loss , and at the end of the agb phase the degenerate core of the low - metallicity , high - mass agb star may reach the chandrasekhar mass , leading to a type 1.5 supernova @xcite .",
    "such suggestion can explain both the enhancement pattern and the metallicity dependence of the double - enhanced halo stars .",
    "there is another scenario of the origin for the double - enhanced halo stars . in this picture",
    ", the formation of a binary system of low - mass stars was triggered by a supernova that polluted and clumped a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "subsequently , the observed star , which is already strongly enhanced in r - process elements , receives large amounts of s - process elements from the initially more massive star that underwent the agb phase and turns into the double - enhanced star @xcite .",
    "the nucleosynthesis of neutron - capture elements for cemp ( carbon - enhanced metal - poor ) stars can be investigated by the abundance pattern of r+s stars .",
    "recently , an analysis of the element abundances for the cemp star he 0338 - 3945 @xcite showed that it is rich in both s- and r - elements .",
    "@xcite reported that this object locates near to the main sequence turnoff with metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath4 .",
    "they concluded that the observed heavy element abundances of he 0338 - 3945 could not be well fit by a scaled solar r - process pattern nor by a scaled solar s - process pattern .",
    "it is a challenging problem to quantitatively understand of the origins of neutron - capture elements in the double - enhanced halo stars .",
    "although some of the basic tools for this task were presented several years ago , the origins of the neutron - capture elements in the double - enhanced halo stars , especially r - process elements , are not clear , and the characteristics of the s - process nucleosynthesis in the agb stars are not ascertained .",
    "clearly , the study of element abundances in these objects is important for investigation of the origin of neutron - capture elements in these objects and in our galaxy .",
    "one might hope that a clarification of the origin of r+s stars may shed some light on the general questions concerning the sites of r- and s - processes .",
    "it is interesting to adopt the parametric model for metal - poor stars presented by @xcite and developed by @xcite to study the physical conditions that could reproduce the observed abundance pattern found in such type stars . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the characteristics of the nucleosynthesis pathway that produces the special abundance ratios of the r- and s - rich object he 0338 - 3945 using the agb parametric model .",
    "the calculated results are presented in sect .  2 , where we also discuss the characteristics of the s - process nucleosynthesis and the possible origin of their r - process elements .",
    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "by comparing the observed abundances pattern with the predicted s- and r - process contributions , we explore the origin of the heavy elements in he 0338 - 3945 .",
    "we adopt the parametric model for metal - poor stars presented by @xcite .",
    "the abundance of the @xmath5th element in the envelope of a star can be calculated as follows : @xmath6 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the metallicity of the star , @xmath8 is the abundance of the @xmath5th element produced by the s - process in the agb star and @xmath9 is the abundance of the @xmath5th element produced by the r - process ( per si @xmath10 at @xmath11 ) , whereas , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the component coefficients that correspond to contributions from the s - process and the r - process , respectively . the extremely metal - poor star cs 22892 - 052 merits special attention , because this star has an extremely large overabundance of neutron - capture elements relative to iron with [ fe / h ] @xmath14 .",
    "many authors @xcite suggested that the abundance patterns of the heavier ( @xmath3 ) stable neutron - capture elements in very metal - poor stars are consistent with the solar system r - process abundance distribution , and this concordance breaks down for the lighter neutron - capture elements in the range of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that when the abundances of the lighter elements in cs 22892 - 052 are multiplied by a factor of @xmath16 , the abundance distributions obtained for both heavier and lighter neutron - capture elements are in accordance with the solar system r - process pattern .",
    "this star could have abundances that well reflect the nucleosynthesis of a single supernova @xcite , so the adopted abundances of nuclei @xmath9 in equation @xmath17 are taken as the solar system r - process abundances @xcite for the elements heavier than ba , and for the lighter nuclei we use solar system r - process abundances multiplied by a factor of 0.4266 .",
    "there are four parameters in our model for r+s stars , such as the neutron exposure per thermal pulse @xmath18 , the overlap factor @xmath19 , the component coefficient of the s - process @xmath12 , and the component coefficient of the r - process @xmath13 . using the observed data in the sample star he 0338 - 3945 @xcite , the parameters in the model can be obtained from the parametric approach .",
    "our best - fit results are shown in figure 1 . for he 0338 - 3945",
    ", the curves produced by our model are consistent with the observed abundances for almost all the 21 heavy elements within the error limits .",
    "the good agreement between the model results and the observations provides strong support for the validity and reliability of the derived neutron - capture nucleosynthesis parameters .",
    "the overlap factor @xmath19 is a fundamental parameter in the agb model . at solar metallicity",
    ", @xcite found that the value of the overlap factor @xmath19 is between @xmath20 and @xmath21 in their standard evolution model for low - mass ( @xmath22 ) agb stars .",
    "the overlap factor deduced for he 0338 - 3945 is @xmath23 , which lies in the above range .",
    "the overlap factor for different initial - mass agb stars as a function of metallicity has been presented by @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) . considering its metallicity",
    ", we suggest that the mass of the primary star ( former agb star ) is less than @xmath24 , i.e. it lies between @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "the neutron exposure per pulse @xmath18 is another fundamental parameter . @xcite",
    "have deduced neutron exposures per pulse for other s - enhanced metal - poor stars , and found they lie between @xmath26 and @xmath27 mbarn@xmath28 .",
    "the neutron exposure deduced for he 0338 - 3945 is @xmath29 mbarn@xmath28 , which also lies in above range . in the case of multiple subsequent exposures ,",
    "the mean neutron exposure is given by @xmath30ln@xmath19 .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath31 mbarn@xmath28 ( @xmath32 , in units of 10@xmath33 k ) for he 0338 - 3945 is significantly greater than that of @xmath34 mbarn@xmath28 , which is best fit the solar system abundances @xcite .",
    "in fact , the higher mean neutron exposure favors the more amount of much heavier elements produced , such as ba and pb etc . for the s - only star cs 30322 - 023 , @xcite obtained its mean neutron exposure , i.e. @xmath35 mbarn@xmath28 , which is lower than that of he 0338 - 3945 . based on the observation results @xcite",
    ", we can find that the abundance ratios of [ hs / ls ] @xmath36 ( where hs denotes the ` heavy ' s - process elements , such as ba , la , ce and ls denotes the ` light ' s - process elements , such as sr , y , zr ) in he 0338 - 3945 is larger than that of [ hs / ls ] @xmath37 in cs 30322 - 023 .",
    "this is consistent with the relation between the two mean neutron exposure for these two stars .",
    "[ pb / hs ] is particularly useful in investigating the efficiency of the s - process site @xcite . using both the convective model and the radiative model , @xcite",
    "have calculated [ pb / hs ] versus [ fe / h ] for different initial stellar mass .",
    "considering the [ pb / hs]@xmath38 and [ fe / h ] @xmath4 for he 0338 - 3945 , we suggest that the mass of the former agb star is about @xmath0 .    for cemp - s stars",
    "the most likely scenario is the pollution by mass transfer from a more massive agb companion in a binary system , the later has undergone agb nucleosynthesis and become a white dwarf .",
    "the s - process elements and c abundances in he 0338 - 3945 are a result of pollution from the dredged - up material in the former agb star .",
    "the measured [ s / fe ] refers to the average s - process material in the agb star after dilution by mixing with the envelope of the companion that is now the extrinsic star .",
    "other parameters deduced for he 0338 - 3945 are @xmath39 and @xmath40 . during the agb evolution , the convective he shell and the envelope of the star are overabundant in heavy elements by factors @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the approximate relation between @xmath42 and @xmath41 is @xmath43 where @xmath44@xmath45 is the total mass dredged up from the he shell into the envelope of the agb star and @xmath46 is the envelope mass of the agb star . for a given s - process element",
    ", the overabundance factor @xmath47 in the extrinsic star s envelope can be approximately related to the overabundance factor @xmath42 by @xmath48 where @xmath44@xmath49 is the amount of matter accreted by the extrinsic star , @xmath50 is the envelope mass of the star . the component coefficient @xmath51 is computed from the relation @xmath52    it is found that substantial enhancements of carbon and nitrogen with respect to iron are common among cemp stars @xcite .",
    "agb nucleosynthesis models for low initial mass ( @xmath53 ) show that carbon is produced by the @xmath54 reaction during thermal pulses , but not nitrogen because it is burned during the same helium shell flashes , while for higher mass agb stars the dredged - up carbon effectively converts into nitrogen by cn - cycling at the bottom of the convective envelope ( hot bottom burning , hbb ; * ? ? ?",
    "detailed evolution models of agb stars @xcite showed that hbb sets in at significantly lower mass at low metallicity ( @xmath24 at [ fe / h ] @xmath55 ) than that at solar metallicity ( around @xmath56 ) . in figure 2 , we show the enhancements of n and c relative to iron in he 0338 - 3945 and compare them with the predicted abundance ratios for agb models according to @xcite with @xmath57 . the possible abundance ratios of the companion polluted by a former agb star with different initial mass are plotted as solid lines . from this figure",
    "we can see that agb stars with masses between @xmath25 and @xmath24 produce nitrogen and carbon in the right amounts to account for the observed abundances , after accretion of the material by a low - mass companion and subsequent dilution in its envelope .",
    "for @xmath0 , the factor @xmath58 is about @xmath59 @xcite and comparing the observation abundance of c and n with the calculated results of @xcite , the dilution factor @xmath60 for he 0338 - 3945 is about @xmath61 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath62 is deduced from equation @xmath63 , which is close to our calculated value , i.e. @xmath39 , for he 0338 - 3945 using the parametric model . as the observational abundance ratios of [ c / fe ] @xmath64 and [ n / fe ] @xmath65 @xcite , we believe that hbb does not happen in the agb companion , i.e. the initial mass of the agb companion is less than @xmath24 @xcite with its metallicity considered , which is in agreement with the obtained results .",
    "it should be mentioned that the c and n abundances come from the @xcite 1d lte analysis based on the ch and cn molecule lines , however , which are uncertain , due to the strong temperature sensitivity of the ch and cn molecule formation .",
    "preliminary results for the 3d corrections may amount to approximately @xmath66 to @xmath67 and @xmath66 dex for carbon and nitrogen , respectively @xcite . the results , when the 3d corrections of @xmath66 dex for carbon and nitrogen are considered , are also shown in figure 2 .",
    "we can see form this figure that the 3d effects do not influence our results .",
    "@xcite suggested that the strong metallicity dependence of mass loss during the agb phase leads to a steeper initial - final mass relation for low - metalliciy stars , that is , for a given initial mass , the final mass is higher for metal - poor stars .",
    "therefore , the core of , e.g. , a metal - poor star with [ fe / h ] @xmath68 having an initial mass of @xmath69 would reach the chandrasekhar mass , leading to a  type 1.5 \" supernova .",
    "in such a supernova , r - process nucleosynthesis might occur , and the surface of the companion star observed today could have been polluted .",
    "our results imply clearly that he 0338 - 3945 should be polluted by a @xmath0 agb star , which could not cause a  type 1.5 \" supernova .",
    "the component coefficient of the r - process calculated for he 0338 - 3945 is @xmath40 , which means that this star and its agb companion should form in a molecular cloud that had already been polluted by r - process material .",
    "apart from carbon and nitrogen , we concentrate on oxygen enrichments as possible tracers of the origin of cemp stars .",
    "@xcite derived a super - solar oxygen abundance of [ o / fe ] @xmath70 in the halo star he 0338 - 3945 . in figure 3 , we show the enhancements of o and c relative to iron observed in he 0338 - 3945 and compare these to the abundance ratios in the material lost by agb stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath55 according to the @xcite .",
    "the abundance ratios of the companion polluted by a former agb star with different initial mass are plotted as solid lines .",
    "this figure shows that agb stars with masses between @xmath71 and @xmath72 do not produce enough o to account for the observed abundance .",
    "this means that o does nt mainly come from the former agb star , it must have another origin .",
    "it is noteworthy that the o abundance derived by @xcite based on 1d lte analysis of the o i triple lines , which are known to be sensitive to the nlte effects .",
    "@xcite estimated the nlte effects were to be @xmath73 dex .",
    "however , recently , @xcite have redone the o i nlte calculations with new electron collisional data , which leads to much larger nlte effects , about @xmath67 to @xmath74 dex for the given stellar parameters .",
    "however , the exact corrections depend on the still uncertain hydrogen collisional cross - sections . for this star",
    ", we estimate that the nlte correction of o is of the order of @xmath66 dex , and the result is also shown in figure 3 . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the o abundance in he 0338 - 3945 is still not reproduced by the agb model , even if the nlte corrections have been considered .",
    "the observed results for he 0338 - 3945 @xcite are shown as filled circles in figure 4 , where the red solid line represents the results calculated by the parametric model , while the black solid line represents the results given by @xcite for @xmath0 agb model adopting a factor @xmath60 of 1/33 .",
    "it can be seen that there is good agreement between the observation data on c , n and these of the agb model within the error limits .",
    "it is interesting to simultaneously analyse the observed light and heavy elements to study the physical conditions that could reproduce the observed abundance pattern found in this star . indeed ,",
    "some very metal - poor stars , such as cs 22892 - 052 , have high abundance ratios of heavier neutron - capture elements , e.g. eu @xcite .",
    "cs 22892 - 052 possibly record the abundance patterns produced by the r - process and is called as an r - ii star . in this star ,",
    "the abundances of neutron - capture elements are in remarkable agreement with the scaled solar system r - process pattern @xcite .",
    "this is the first determination of the overall abundance pattern that could represent the yields of the r - process .",
    "the abundances in this star must have been printed and enhanced by the r - process elements and other elements which are produced in conjunction with the r - process . in order to investigate the light elements pattern in this r+s star , we use cs 22892 - 052 as an r - process only star , and plot its observed element abundances normalized to eu in this figure , too ( see the blue dash dot line ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is believed that eu is mainly made by the r - process .",
    "for the two stars , he 0338 - 3945 and cs 22892 - 052 , shown in this figure , have almost identical abundance pattern from n to cu including o , but the c and heavy s - process elements , such as ba and pb , differ greater than @xmath75 dex , which indicates that the origin of c and s - process elements is agb stars . because the overabundance of o and c for he 0338 - 3945 , could not be explained simultaneously by any agb star ( see figure 3 )",
    ", we can conclude that the production of o should accompany with the production of the heavy r - process elements for this r+s star .",
    "we note that though the overabundance of o for he 0338 - 3945 is larger than that for cs 22892 - 052 , but when considering its also larger overabundance of eu , the abundance pattern of o and r - process elements for he 0338 - 3945 is still close to that for the r - ii star cs 22892 - 052 . it can be found that the heavy r - process elements are not produced in conjunction with all the elements from na to fe group elements , which is similar to r - ii stars , too @xcite .",
    "combined the calculated results of neutron - capture elements , we find that the abundance pattern of the r - process and light elements in he 0338 - 3945 is vary close to that of the r - ii star cs 22892 - 052 .",
    "this implies that this star should be a special r - ii star ? in this figure , we do not attempt to correct the c , n and o abundance in he 0338 - 3945 for 3d or nlte effects",
    "quantitatively because of the still uncertain h collisions .",
    "although the corrections are expected to decrease their abundances , our conclusions are not significantly influenced .",
    "it is important to discuss the uncertainty of the derived parameters using the method presented by @xcite .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show the calculated ratios log@xmath76(sr ) , log@xmath76(ba ) , log@xmath76(pb ) and log@xmath76(eu ) as a function of the neutron exposure @xmath18 in a model with @xmath77 and as a function of overlap factor @xmath19 with a fixed neutron exposure @xmath29 mbarn@xmath28 .",
    "these are compared with the observed abundance ratios in he 0338 - 3945 .",
    "there is only a region of overlap in figure 5 , @xmath78 mbarn@xmath28 , in which all the observed ratios referred above can be accounted for .",
    "the bottom panel in figure 5 displays the reduced @xmath79 value calculated in our model , and there is a minimum @xmath80 at @xmath29 mbarn@xmath28 ; the neutron exposure is constrained quite well . the abundance ratios log@xmath76(sr ) , log@xmath76(ba ) , log@xmath76(pb ) and log@xmath76(eu ) are insensitive to the overlap factor @xmath19 and allow for a wider range , i.e. @xmath81 .",
    "the chemical abundances of the extremely r- and s - rich star he 0338 - 3945 are an excellent test bed to set new constraints on models of neutron - capture process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity .",
    "the neutron - capture element abundance pattern of he 0338 - 3945 could be explained by a binary system formed in a molecular cloud that had ever been polluted by r - process material .",
    "based on the good fit using the agb models @xcite and parametric model @xcite to match the observed abundance pattern including the abundances of c and n , we deduce that the progenitor mass of the agb star is about @xmath0 .",
    "the more massive companion underwent an agb phase , and produced lots of c , n and s - process isotopes .",
    "subsequently , the envelope of he 0338 - 3945 is enriched with the dredged - up material from the former agb star .",
    "the initial mass of the agb companion is less than @xmath69 , which excludes the possibility of forming a type 1.5 supernova .",
    "overall , the predicted abundances for the r / s - process fit well the observed abundance patterns of he 338 - 3945 , for the first ( sr and zr ) and second peaks ( ba and la ) , as well as the third peak of the s - process ( pb ) .",
    "we find that the production of o should accompany with the production of the heavy r - process elements for r+s stars and the contribution of o in he 0338 - 3945 from the agb stars is swamped by the pre - enrichment of o. similar to r - ii stars , the heavy r - process elements are not produced in conjunction with all the elements from na to fe group elements .",
    "the abundance pattern of the r - process and light elements in he 0338 - 3945 is very close to that of the r - ii star cs 22892 - 052 .",
    "this implies that this star may be a special r - ii star .    clearly , it is important for future studies to determine the relation between r - ii and r+s stars , whether the r - pattern in r - ii stars can explain the abundance distribution of the r - material in r+s stars .",
    "more in - depth theoretical and observational studies of r - rich and r+s stars will reveal the characteristics of the r- and s - process at low metallicity and the history of the enrichment of neutron - capture elements in the early galaxy .",

    "<S> the very metal - poor star he 0338 - 3945 shows a double - enhanced pattern of the neutron - capture elements . </S>",
    "<S> the study to this sample could make people gain a better understanding of s- and r - process nucleosynthesis at low metallicity . using a parametric model </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the abundance pattern of the neutron - capture elements could be best explained by a binary system formed in a molecular cloud , which had been polluted by r - process material . the observed abundance pattern of c and n can be explained by an agb model @xcite . combing with the parameters obtained from @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that the initial mass of the agb companion is most likely to be about @xmath0 , which excludes the possibility of forming a type-1.5 supernova . by comparing with the observational abundance pattern of cs 22892 - 052 , we find that the dominating production of o should accompany with the production of the heavy r - process elements of r+s stars . </S>",
    "<S> similar to r - ii stars , the heavy r - process elements are not produced in conjunction with all the light elements from na to fe group . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance pattern of the light and r - process elements for he 0338 - 3945 is very close to the pattern of the r - ii star cs 22892 - 052 . </S>",
    "<S> so , we suggest that this star he 0338 - 3945 should be a special r - ii star . </S>"
