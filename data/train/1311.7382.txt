    "in the last years we have witnessed an impressive step forward in the implementation of quantum information technologies , ranging from quantum communication to quantum computation .",
    "one of the main requirements to achieve this goal and pass from theoretical predictions to experimental realizations is the characterization of the quantum states and the operations involved in the protocols .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to the introduction of new parameters aimed at characterizing the states : one of these is the non - gaussianity . here",
    "we show how such a parameter can be successfully used to characterize states which turn out to be experimentally indistinguishable from each other when setups based only on photon - number resolving ( pnr ) detectors and direct detection schemes are employed .    among the conditional measurements , photon subtraction ( ps ) , both single and multiple ,",
    "is an effective method to enhance quantum features of optical field states @xcite .",
    "the process , which is in general implemented by mixing at a beam splitter ( bs ) an input state with the vacuum , is obtained by performing pnr measurements at one output and selecting the other output only if a certain condition on the number of detected photons is satisfied . when ps is applied to nonclassical fields , it can lead to the generation of highly nonclassical states @xcite , such as squeezed fock states @xcite and cat - like states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ps can be used in the continuos variable regime to enhance teleportation fidelity @xcite and non - locality @xcite .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "ps is in general a non - gaussian operation : when applied to gaussian states @xcite , namely states described by a gaussian characteristic function , it generates conditional non - gaussian states , whose characteristic functions are no longer gaussian @xcite .",
    "based on this result , one would expect that applying ps to native non - gaussian states would increase the amount of non - gaussianity . on the other hand ,",
    "if one applies ps to native non - gaussian states , one would expect an increase in the non - gaussianity amount .",
    "this intuition is not always true and the effect of the ps operation is in general non - obvious .    in this paper",
    "we investigate , both theoretically and experimentally , the effect of ps on a particular class of classical states , the displaced phase - averaged coherent states , which are obtained by first averaging the phase of a coherent state and then displacing it @xcite",

    "[ s : cond : s ] , where we also discuss the symmetry properties .",

    "a phase - averaged coherent ( phav ) state , the main ingredient of our investigation , is obtained from a coherent state @xmath1 by averaging over the phase @xmath2 . a phav state with amplitude @xmath3",

    "the latter representation is particularly useful to understand why a phav state alone is not suitable to produce conditional states by means of ps . in order to be an actual conditioning operation",
    ", ps requires the existence of intensity correlations between the two involved beams . in the case of classical states mixed with the vacuum at a bs , the amount of intensity correlations at the output is a function of the first two moments of the photon - number statistics @xcite . in particular , for a balanced bs we can write @xmath10 @xmath11 being the average number of photons of the state and @xmath12 the corresponding variance . in the presence of a poisson photon - number distribution , as in the case of a coherent or a phav state , we have @xmath13 and no intensity correlations are observed between the two outputs , i.e. @xmath14 . for this reason , the transmitted beam is unaffected by the operation performed on the reflected one and @xmath15 .    on the other hand , if a displacement operation is applied to a phav state , the resulting state , namely the displaced phav ( dphav ) state , gives rise to two classically correlated beams when it is divided at a bs @xcite .",
