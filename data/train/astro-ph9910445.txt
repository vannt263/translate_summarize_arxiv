    "the galactic disk intermediate age open clusters are those clusters whose ages range between the hyades and ic  4651 ( carraro et al 1999a ) .",
    "they are fundamental templates to study the internal structure of main sequence ( ms ) stars with mass between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "in particular , they can be used to check the importance and the amount of the core overshooting during the h - burning phase ( carraro et al 1993 , rosvick & vandenberg 1998 ) .",
    "usually the comparison between observational data and theoretical models is done by means of the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the dating operation of the stellar ensembles by means of isochrone fitting , luminosity functions and star counts . for stellar clusters , obtaining reasonable age estimates",
    "requires knowledge of cluster reddening , distance and metallicity .",
    "ir photometry is particularly useful to obtain cluster reddening when combined with optical photometry .",
    "additionally , it is possible to get an estimate of the cluster metallicity whenever a red giant branch ( rgb ) is visible ( tiede et al . 1997 ) .",
    "this study is a part of a general project of observations of galactic open clusters in the infrared ( vallenari et al .",
    "1999 , carraro et al .",
    "in this paper we present ir camera photometry in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 pass - bands for two intermediate age open clusters , ic  166 and ngc  7789 .",
    "ic  166 is a poorly studied open cluster for which no previous ir data exist , while ngc  7789 is a rather well - studied open cluster , for which up to now ir data were available only for a handful of stars .",
    "table  1 summarizes some general properties of the two target clusters .",
    "diameters are taken from the lyng ( 1987 ) catalogue of open clusters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe the data acquisition and reduction ; section  3 is devoted to the analysis of the data for ic  166 , while section  4 is dedicated to ngc  7789 .",
    "section  5 draws our conclusions .    0.10truecm    .basic parameters of the studied clusters .",
    "diameters are taken from lyng ( 1987 ) catalogue . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the standard deviation of the zero points are 0.03 mag for the j and 0.04 for the k magnitude .",
    "this error is only due to the linear interpolation of the standard stars .",
    "however the calibration uncertainty is dominated by the error due to the correction from aperture photometry to psf fitting magnitude . taking this into account ,",
    "we estimate that the total calibration error is about 0.1 mag both in @xmath0 and in @xmath1 passbands . the photometric errors , as produced by dahphot are 0.02 , 0.05 and 0.1 at @xmath0 equal to 8 , 12 and 16 mag , respectively , and slightly lower in the @xmath1 band .",
    "accordingly , the maximum error in the color amounts to about 0.25 .",
    "+ fitting photometry was a natural choice , due to the number of stars to be measured and the concentration of stars ( crowding ) in some cluster regions , where psf wings overlap .",
    "the standard stars used for the calibration do not cover the entire colour range of the data , because of the lack of stars redder than @xmath6 . from our data , no colour term is found for k mag , whereas we can not exclude it for the j magnitude .",
    "the data tables are available upon request from the authors .",
    "ic  166 ( c0149 + 615 , ocl  334 , trumpler class ii 1 r ) is a faint , distant and possibly old cluster ( king 1964 ) .",
    "the only photometric study was done by burkhead ( 1969 ) , who obtained bv photographic photometry for about 200 stars in the central region of the cluster , covering a circular area of @xmath7 ( see fig .  1 ) and reaching @xmath8 .",
    "he reported also ubv photo - electric photometry for 20 stars out of the cluster region .",
    "the derived cmd shows a wide ms , with the turn - off - point ( to ) located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; the herzsprung gap and a conspicuous clump of red stars are also seen .",
    "there is no evidence for rgb stars , which implies that the cluster is intermediate in age between the hyades and ngc  7789 ( carraro et al .",
    "burkhead ( 1969 ) could not determine the reddening due to the lack of photometry in u band for cluster members .",
    "assuming e(b - v ) @xmath11 0.80 , he found a distance modulus @xmath12 12.6 , and a distance of 3.3  kpc from the sun .",
    "finally , inspecting the palomar sky atlas , he estimated a diameter of about 5 arcmin .",
    "the cmd of ic  166 in the plane @xmath1 vs @xmath13 is shown in fig .  3 .",
    "the upper left panel shows the cmd for all the detected stars , the upper right for the stars lying in the same region as burkhead ( 1969 ) photometry ( see also fig .  1 ) .",
    "the lower left panel shows the stars outside @xmath14 from the cluster center , and finally the lower right shows the cmd in the region between about @xmath15 and @xmath16 from the cluster center .",
    "the cluster center has been fixed on the top of the star # 1 in the burkhead second quadrant .",
    "we cover a region of @xmath17 , whose center is offset by @xmath18 with respect to the burkhead ( 1969 ) photometry .",
    "nonetheless we cover almost all the cluster region .",
    "our cmd shows a wide ms and a sparse rgb clump .",
    "the ms extension is the same as the optical one from burkhead ( 1969 ) .",
    "the contamination of foreground stars is considerable in the upper left panel , whereas the cluster clearly dominates in the upper and lower right panels .",
    "a representative contaminating disk population is better visible in the lower left panel , outside the burkhead ( 1969 ) radius .",
    "this confirms that the burkhead ( 1969 ) radius estimate ( @xmath19 arcmin ) is basically correct .    from the global cmd morphology we can confirm that ic  166 is an intermediate age open cluster , as old as ngc  2477 ( 1.0 gyr , carraro & chiosi 1994 ) , but younger than ngc  7789 ( 1.6 gyr , gim et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "useful information about the reddening of ic  166 can be derived by combining optical and infrared photometry .",
    "we found 30 stars in common between our study and burkhead ( 1969 ) . singling out the ms stars , we are left with 8 stars .",
    "these are plotted in the plane ( j - k ) vs ( v - k ) ( see fig .  4 ) and ( j - k ) vs ( b - v ) ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "superimposed are zero age ms for z = 0.009 metallicity taken form bertelli et al .",
    "the fit in fig .",
    "4 has been obtained by shifting the zams with e(v - k ) = 1.35 @xmath20 0.50 and e(j - k ) = 0.25 @xmath20 0.10 , corresponding to a ratio e(v - k ) / e(j - k ) @xmath11 5.4 , close to the value 5.3 reported by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . from fig .",
    "5 we get e(b - v ) = 0.50 @xmath20 0.20 and e(j - k ) = 0.25 @xmath20 0.10 .",
    "this gives a ratio e(j - k ) / e(b - v ) @xmath11 0.50 which again is close to the value 0.52 from cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . these results ,",
    "although consistent , are to be taken as provisional , until a deeper optical and ir photometry will be available .      distance and age are inferred by fitting the cmd of ic  166 ( see fig  .6 ) with theoretical isochrones ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the metal content of ic  166 has been determined by friel & janes ( 1993 ) using moderate resolution spectroscopy of 4 giant stars .",
    "[ fe / h ] is -0.32 @xmath20 0.20 , which translates into the theoretical metal abundance value z = 0.009 ( bertelli et al .",
    "1994 ) . adopting the reddening value derived above ( e(j - k )  =  0.25 ) , and the spectroscopic metallicity from friel & janes ( 1993 ) , we obtain an acceptable fit with a 1.0 gyr isochrone . in fitting the isochrone to the cmd",
    "we have looked at the to magnitude and at the mean clump magnitude , since the shape of the ms below the to is not well defined .",
    "this implies that it is difficult to give an error to the age until a deeper photometry is available .",
    "the mean clump magnitude allows us to derive the apparent distance modulus .",
    "we obtain @xmath21 14.00 @xmath20 0.30 , but the true distance modulus turns out to be @xmath22 13.25 , which puts ic  166 4.5 @xmath20 0.6 kpc from the sun .",
    "this value for the distance is significantly larger than the burkhead ( 1969 ) estimate .",
    "we ascribe this result to the different value we find for the cluster reddening .",
    "ngc  7789 is a populous intermediate age open cluster very well studied in the past .",
    "the most recent photometry is from gim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who studied 15,000 stars within a radius of @xmath23 from the cluster center , and which the reader is referred to for more detailed informations on this important cluster .",
    "the fundamental parameters of this cluster have been determined several times : ngc  7789 is about 1.6 gyr old ( gim et al . 1998 ) ; the available metallicity determinations range from -0.26 to -0.62 , as measured by the index [ fe / h ] ( friel & janes 1993 , tiede et al .",
    "1997 ) ; reddening amounts to e(b - v ) = 0.35 , while true distance modulus is @xmath24 . near ir photometry",
    "is reported by manteiga et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for a sample of 14 presumed blue stragglers in the field of ngc  7789 to test the binary hypothesis for these stars , and by frogel & elias ( 1988 ) for a sample of 10 bright red giants to study the mass loss mechanism during the rgb climbing .",
    "we find 6 stars in common with frogel & elias ( 1988 ) , namely the stars @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , according to the kstner ( 1923 ) numbering .",
    "the photometric comparison of these stars provides a good agreement , with the mean differences being :    @xmath31    @xmath32    where the suffix @xmath33 refers to frogel & elias ( 1988 ) , and @xmath34 to the present study .",
    "the errors reported are the standard deviations around the mean values . using",
    "this small sample we can not outline any clear trend with colors or magnitudes .",
    "our study covers a region within @xmath35 of the cluster center ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we obtain photometry for about 1030 stars down to @xmath36 .",
    "this allows us to present the first cmd of ngc  7789 in the infrared .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "the ms is quite wide , and shows the to at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "a prominent clump is situated at @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the rgb is defined by the stars plotted by us with a different symbol ( filled circles ) .",
    "the overall morphology is typical of an intermediate age open cluster ( carraro et al .",
    "1999a ) .",
    "the cmd diagram in the ir allows us to derive an independent estimate of the cluster abundance by using the photometric method originally developed by kuchinski & frogel(1995 ) for metal rich globular clusters , and then applied by tiede et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a sample of intermediate age open clusters .",
    "this method correlates the slope of the rgb , defined as @xmath41 with the cluster metallicity , measured by the index [ fe / h ] . for globulars",
    "the relation reads :    @xmath42 = -2.98 - 23.84 \\times ( gb slope).\\ ] ]    tiede et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that equation ( 7 ) , when applied to open clusters rather than globulars , tends to underestimate open cluster metallicity .",
    "for instance , in the case of ngc  7789 they found [ fe / h ] = -0.62 by using equation ( 7 ) , whereas the spectroscopic determination is [ fe / h ] = -0.26 .",
    "for this reason they give a new calibration of the relation , which provides new values for the coefficients when dealing with different populations ( globulars , open , or bulge clusters ) .",
    "for open clusters , the modified relation reads :    @xmath42 = -1.639 - 14.243 \\times ( gb slope).\\ ] ]    to find the rgb slope we performed a least squares fit to the rgb stars as indicated in fig .  7 .",
    "this implies an rgb slope @xmath43 of -0.097 @xmath20 0.007 . by using the relation ( 8)",
    ", we obtain [ fe / h ] = -0.25 @xmath20 0.11 .",
    "the reported error has to be considered as an optimistic estimate , since it does not take into account the uncertainties in the coefficients of eq .",
    "8 , and the sensitivity of the rgb slope to the method adopted for its computation . however the value we find implies a metal content close the spectroscopic estimate ( -0.26 @xmath20 0.06 , friel & janes 1993 ) .",
    "as for ic  166 , we combine together optical and infrared photometry .",
    "we found 980 stars in common between our study and the optical photometry of gim et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . out of these",
    "we consider ms the stars brighter than @xmath0 = 14 and in the color interval @xmath44 , to limit disk stars contamination .",
    "these ms stars are plotted in fig .",
    "although the scatter is large , a reasonable fit can be obtained shifting a z = 0.010 zams taken from bertelli et al .",
