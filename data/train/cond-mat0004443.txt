    "when a gas or vapor is brought into contact with a clean solid surface , some portion of the gas particles becomes reversibly attached to the surface forming an adsorbed layer .",
    "following the seminal work of langmuir ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , equilibrium properties of such adsorbed layers have been extensively studied and a significant number of important advancements have been made .",
    "in particular , subsequent analysis included more realistic forms of intermolecular interactions or allowed for a possibility of multilayer formation .",
    "as a result , different phase transformations have been predicted and different forms of adsorption isotherms have been deduced , which are well corroborated by available experimental data ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite ) .    some work has been focused on understanding of random motion of individual molecules in adsorbed layers , which constitutes an important factor limiting their global dynamical behavior .",
    "for instance , transport processes control spreading rates of molecular films on solid surfaces @xcite , spontaneous or forced dewetting of monolayers @xcite or island formation @xcite . here",
    ", some approximate analytical results have been obtained for both dynamics of an isolated adatom on a corrugated surface and collective diffusion , describing spreading of macroscopic density fluctuations in interacting adsorbates being in contact with the vapor phase @xcite .",
    "analysis of tracer diffusion in adsorbed layers , which provides a useful information about intrinsic friction of the adsorbates , pertains mostly to two - dimensional models with forbidden particles exchanges with the vapor ( see , e.g. refs.@xcite .",
    "tracer diffusion in adsorbed monolayers undergoing continuous adsorption and desorption has been essentially less studied .",
    "a few available detailed studies are either devoted to an analysis of a somewhat artificial one - dimensional situation @xcite , or , for two - dimensional adsorbates in contact with the vapor , focus on the limit when the tracer particle perform a totally directed random walk @xcite .",
    "the results for the general situation with arbitrary bias has been only briefly presented in ref.@xcite .    in this paper , which completes our earlier short publication @xcite",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the properties of a biased tracer diffusion in two - dimensional adsorbed monolayers undergoing continuous exchanges with the vapor .",
    "the system we consider consists of ( a ) a solid substrate , which is modeled in a usual fashion as a regular square lattice of adsorbtion sites ; ( b ) a monolayer of adsorbed , mobile hard - core particles in contact with a vapor and ( c ) a single hard - core tracer particle ( tp ) .",
    "the monolayer particles move randomly along the lattice by performing symmetric hopping motion between the neighboring lattice sites , which process is constrained by mutual hard - core interactions , and may desorb from and adsorb onto the lattice from the vapor with some prescribed rates dependent on the vapor pressure , temperature and the interactions with the solid substrate .",
    "in contrast , the tracer particle is constrained to move on the two - dimensional lattice only , ( i.e. it can not desorb to the vapor ) , and is subject to a constant external force @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the tp performs a biased random walk , constrained by the hard - core interactions with the monolayer particles , and always remains within the monolayer , probing its frictional properties .    in terms of an approximate approach of ref.@xcite , based on the decoupling of the third - order tracer - particle - particle correlation functions into the product of corresponding pairwise correlations ,",
    "we determine the density profiles of the monolayer particles , as seen from the stationary moving tracer , and calculate analytically the terminal velocity @xmath0 attained by the tracer particle in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "we show that the monolayer particles distribution is strongly inhomogeneous : the local density of the monolayer particles in front of the tracer is higher than the average , which means that the monolayer particles tend to accumulate in front of the driven tracer , creating a sort of a `` traffic jam '' , which impedes its motion .",
    "the condensed , `` traffic jam''-like region vanishes as an exponential function of the distance from the tracer .",
    "the characteristic length and the amplitude of the density relaxation function are calculated explicitly .",
    "on the other hand , past the tracer the local density is lower than the average . here , we find that depending on whether the number of particles in the monolayer is explicitly conserved or not , the local density past the tracer may tend to the average value at large separations from the tracer in a completely different fashion : in the non - conserved case the decay of the density is described by an exponential function , while for the conserved particles number case it shows an @xmath9 dependence on the distance , revealing in the latter case especially strong memory effects and strong correlations between the particle distribution in the monolayer and the tracer position .",
    "further on , we find that the terminal velocity of the tracer particle depends explicitly on both the excess density in the `` jammed '' region in front of the tracer , as well as on the density in the depleted region past the tracer .",
    "we realize that both densities are themselves dependent on the magnitude of the tracer velocity , applied external force , as well as on the rate of the adsorption / desorption processes and on the rate at which the particles can diffuse away of the tracer , which results in effective non - linear coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath7 . in consequence , in the general case ( for arbitrary adsorption / desorption rates and arbitrary external force ) , @xmath0 can be found only implicitly , as the solution of a transcendental equation relating @xmath0 to the system parameters .",
    "this equation simplifies considerably in the limit of a vanishingly small external bias ; in this case we obtain a linear force - velocity relation , akin to the so - called stokes formula , which signifies that in this limit the frictional force exerted on the tracer particle by the host medium ( the adsorbed monolayer ) is viscous .",
    "the corresponding friction coefficient is also determined explicitly .",
    "we finally remark , that a qualitatively similar physical effect has been predicted recently for a different model system involving a charged particle moving at a constant speed a small distance above the surface of an incompressible , infinitely deep liquid .",
    "it has been shown in refs.@xcite , that the interactions between the moving particle and the fluid molecules induce an effective frictional force exerted on the particle , producing a local distortion of the liquid interface , - a bump , which travels together with the particle and increases effectively its mass . the mass of the bump , which is analogous to the jammed region appearing in our model , depends itself on the particle s velocity resulting in a non - linear coupling between the medium - induced frictional force exerted on the particle and its velocity @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we formulate the model and introduce basic notations . in section 3",
    "we write down the dynamical equations which govern the time evolution of the monolayer particles and of the tracer , and outline the decoupling procedure .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the analytical solution of the decoupled discrete - space evolution equations in the limit @xmath8 in terms of the generating function approach . in section 5",
    "we analyse the asymptotical behavior of the density profiles at large separations in front of and past the tracer particle .",
    "next , in section 6 , we derive formal expressions describing the shape of the density profiles in the adsorbed monolayer and a force - velocity relation in the general case .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the analysis of the general force - velocity relation in the limit of a vanishingly small external bias .",
    "here , we derive an analog of the stokes formula for biased diffusion in adsorbed monolayers undergoing continuous exchanges with the vapor phase , determine the friction coefficient and estimate , through the einstein relation , the tracer diffusion coefficient .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 8 with a brief summary and discussion of our results .",
    "consider a two - dimensional square lattice of adsorption sites of spacing @xmath10 , which is brought in contact with a reservoir containing identic , electrically neutral particles ( vapor phase ) ( fig.1 ) , maintained at a constant pressure .",
    "we suppose that ( a ) the particles may leave the reservoir and adsorb onto any vacant lattice site at a fixed rate @xmath11 ; ( b ) the adsorbed particles may move randomly along the lattice by hopping at a rate @xmath12 to any of four neighboring sites , which process is constrained by hard - core exclusion preventing multiple occupancy , and ( c ) the adsorbed particles may desorb from the lattice back to the reservoir at rate @xmath13 .",
    "both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are site and environment independent .",
    "to describe the time - dependent occupancy of lattice sites , we introduce the variable @xmath16 , which may assume two values :    @xmath17    evidently , local @xmath16 can change its value due to adsorption , desorption and constrained random hopping events , and the total number of particles in the adsorbed monolayer is not explicitly conserved due to adsorption / desorption processes . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean density @xmath18 of the adsorbate , @xmath19 , approaches as @xmath20 a constant value    @xmath21    which relation represents the customary langmuir adsorption isotherm @xcite .",
    "we note also that in the analysis of the stationary - state behavior , we can always turn to the conserved particles number limit by setting @xmath14 and @xmath15 equal to zero and keeping their ratio fixed , i.e. supposing that @xmath22 .",
    "this limit will correspond to the model of biased tracer diffusion in a two - dimensional hard - core lattice gas with fixed particles density @xmath18 , and will allow us to check our analytical predictions against some already known results @xcite .    further on , at @xmath23 we introduce at the lattice origin an extra hard - core particle , whose motion we would like to follow here and whose position at time @xmath24 we denote as @xmath25 .",
    "this tracer particle - the tp , can be thought of as an external probe designed to measure the resistance offered by the monolayer particles to the external perturbance , or , in other words , to measure the intrinsic frictional properties of the adsorbate .",
    "now , we stipulate that the tp is different from the adsorbed particles in two aspects : first , it can not desorb from the lattice and second , it experiences an action of some external driving force , which favors its jumps into a preferential direction .",
    "physically , such a situation may be realized , for instance , if this only particle is charged and the system is subject to a uniform electric field * e*. we suppose here , for simplicity of exposition , that the external force @xmath26 is oriented in the positive @xmath27-direction , i.e. @xmath28 .",
    "more precisely , we define the tp dynamics as follows : we suppose that the tp , which occupies the site @xmath25 at time @xmath24 , waits an exponentially distributed time with mean is different from the corresponding time @xmath29 associated with the monolayer particles dynamics . as a matter of fact",
    ", this should be the case merely because the tp - substrate interactions may be different from the particle - substrate ones .",
    "varying @xmath30 we can mimic different possible situations ; in particular , @xmath31 corresponds to the case when the tracer simply slides along the substrate regardless of the surface corrugation . ]",
    "@xmath30 , and then attempts to hop onto one of four neighboring sites , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are four unit vectors of the square lattice . in what follows",
    "we adopt the notation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 ( respectively , @xmath36 ) will denote @xmath37 ( respectively , @xmath38 ) directions .",
    "next , the jump direction is chosen according to the probablity @xmath39 , which is defined in a usual fashion as @xmath40}{\\sum_{\\mu}\\exp\\big[\\frac{\\beta}{2}({\\bf e \\cdot e}_{\\boldsymbol \\mu})\\big ] } , \\label{defp}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the reciprocal temperature , @xmath42 stands for the scalar product , the charge of the tp is set equal to unity and the sum with the subscript @xmath43 denotes summation over all possible orientations of the vector @xmath44 , that is @xmath45 .",
    "after the jump direction is chosen , the tp attempts to hop onto the target site .",
    "the hop is instantaneously fulfilled if the target site is vacant at this moment of time ; otherwise , i.e. , if the target site is occupied by any adsorbed particle , the jump is rejected and the tp remains at its position .",
    "let @xmath46 denote the entire set of the occupation variables , which defines the instantaneous configuration of the adsorbed particles at the lattice at time moment @xmath24 .",
    "next , let @xmath47 denote the joint probability of finding at time @xmath24 the tp at the site @xmath48 and all adsorbed particles in the configuration @xmath49 .",
    "then , denoting as @xmath50 a configuration obtained from @xmath49 by the kawasaki - type exchange of the occupation variables of two neighboring sites @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and as @xmath53 - a configuration obtained from the original @xmath49 by the replacement @xmath54 , which corresponds to the glauber - type flip of the occupation variable due to the adsorption / desorption events , we have that the time evolution of the configuration probability @xmath47 obeys the following master equation :    @xmath55    where the subscript @xmath56 under the summation symbol signifies that summation extends over all lattice sites except for the site occupied at this time moment by the tp .    now , the instantaneous velocity @xmath57 of the tp can be obtained by multiplying both sides of eq.([eqmaitresse ] ) by @xmath58 and summing over all possible configurations @xmath59 .",
    "this results in the following exact equation determining the tp velocity : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the probability of having at time t an adsorbed particle at position @xmath62 , defined in the frame of reference moving with the tp .",
    "evidently , @xmath63 can also be interpreted as the density profile in the adsorbed monolayer as seen from the moving tp .",
    "equation ( [ vitesse ] ) signifies that the instantaneous velocity of the tp is dependent on the monolayer particles density in the immediate vicinity of the tracer .",
    "if the monolayer is perfectly stirred , or , in other words , if @xmath64 everywhere , ( which implies immediate decoupling of @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) , one would obtain from eq.([vitesse ] ) a trivial mean - field result @xmath65 which states that the only effect of the medium on the tp dynamics is that its jump time @xmath30 gets merely renormalized by a factor @xmath66 , which represents the inverse concentration of voids in the monolayer ; note that @xmath67 defines simply the mean frequency of successful jump events .",
    "however , the situation appears to be more complicated and , as we proceed to show , @xmath63 is different from the equilibrium value @xmath18 everywhere , except for @xmath68 .",
    "this means that the tp strongly perturbs the particles distribution in the monolayer - it is no longer uniform and some non - trivial stationary density profiles emerge .",
    "moreover , @xmath63 appears to be dependent on the tp velocity which results ultimately in a non - linear coupling between @xmath57 and density profiles .",
    "now , in order to calculate the instantaneous mean velocity of the tp we have to determine the mean particles density at the neighboring to the tp sites @xmath69 , which requires , in turn , computation of the density profile @xmath63 for arbitrary @xmath70 .",
    "the latter can be found from the master equation ( [ eqmaitresse ] ) by multiplying both sides by @xmath71 and performing the summation over all configurations @xmath59 . in doing so , we find the following set of equations ( see appendix a for more details ) : @xmath72 where @xmath73 denotes the ascending finite difference operator of the form @xmath74 and @xmath75 the kroneker - delta term @xmath76 signifies that the evolution of the pair correlations , eq.([evolk ] ) , proceeds differently at large separations and at the immediate vicinity of the tp , because of its asymmetric hopping rules , eq.([defp ] ) ( see for more details the points ( a ) and ( b ) in the appendix a ) .",
    "note next that the contribution in the second line in eq.([evolk ] ) , associated with the tp biased diffusion , is non - linear with respect to the occupation numbers such that the pair correlation function gets effectively coupled to the evolution of the third - order correlations of the form @xmath77 that is , eq.([evolk ] ) is not closed with respect to the pair correlations but rather represents a first equation in the infinite hierachy of coupled equations for higher - order correlation functions .",
    "one faces , therefore , the problem of solving an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations and needs to resort to an approximate closure scheme .",
    "we proceed along the lines suggested in ref.@xcite and apply the simplest non - trivial closure approximation , based on the decoupling of the third - order correlation functions into the product of pair correlations .",
    "more precisely , we assume that for @xmath78 the third - order correlation can be written down in the following form @xmath79 i.e. the joint probability of having at time moment @xmath24 one adsorbed particle in the immediate vicinity of the tp , at position @xmath80 , and another particle at position @xmath62 , is represented as the product of the corresponding pairwise probabilities .",
    "we hasten to remark that the approximate closure of the evolution equations in eq.([decouplage ] ) has been already employed for studying related models of biased tracer diffusion in hard - core lattices gases and has been shown to provide quite an accurate description of both the dynamical and stationary - state behavior .",
    "the decoupling in eq.([decouplage ] ) has been first introduced in ref.@xcite to determine the properties of a driven tracer diffusion in a one - dimensional hard - core lattice gas with a conserved number of particles , i.e. without an exchange of particles with the reservoir .",
    "extensive numerical simulations performed in ref.@xcite have demonstrated that such a decoupling provides quite a plausible approximation for the model under study . moreover ,",
    "rigorous probabilistic analysis of ref.@xcite has shown that for this model the results based on the decoupling scheme in eq.([decouplage ] ) are exact .",
    "furthermore , the same closure procedure has been recently applied to describe spreading kinetics of a hard - core lattice gas from a reservoir attached to one of the lattice sites @xcite .",
    "again , a very good agreement between the analytical predictions and numerical results has been found .",
    "next , the decoupling in eq.([decouplage ] ) has been used in a recent analysis of a biased tracer dynamics in a one - dimensional model of adsorbed monolayer in contact with a vapor phase @xcite , i.e. a one - dimensional version of the model to be studied here .",
    "also in this case an excellent agreement has been observed between the analytical predictions and monte carlo simulations data @xcite .",
    "besides , as we have already mentioned in ref.@xcite , the closure of the hierarchy of the evolution equations in eq.([decouplage ] ) allows us to reproduce in the limit @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( conserved particles number limit ) the results of refs.@xcite and @xcite , which are known ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) to provide a very good approximation for the tracer diffusion coefficient in two - dimensional hard - core lattice gases with arbitrary particle density .    using the approximation in eq.([decouplage ] ) , we can rewrite eq.([evolk ] ) in the following closed form @xmath83 which holds for all @xmath62 , except for @xmath84 .",
    "one the other hand , for these special sites @xmath85 with @xmath86 we find @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the operator @xmath89 and the coefficients @xmath90 are defined by @xmath91    now , several comments about eqs.([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) are in order .",
    "first of all , let us note that eq.([systemek2 ] ) represents , from the mathematical point of view , the boundary conditions for the general evolution equation ( [ systemek1 ] ) , imposed on the sites in the immediate vicinity of the tp . as we have noticed already , eqs.([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) have a different functional form since in the immediate vicinity of the tp its asymmetric hopping rules perturb essentially the monolayer particles dynamics .",
    "next , eqs.([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) possess some intrinsic symmetries and hence the number of independent parameters can be reduced .",
    "namely , reversing the field , i.e. changing @xmath92 , leads to the mere replacement of @xmath93 by @xmath94 but does not affect @xmath95 with @xmath96 , which implies that @xmath97 besides , since the transition probabilities in eq.([defp ] ) obey @xmath98 one evidently has that @xmath99 and hence , by symmetry , @xmath100 which somewhat simplifies eqs.([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) .",
    "lastly , we note that despite the fact that using the decoupling scheme in eq.([decouplage ] ) we effectively close the system of equations on the level of the pair correlations , solution of eqs.([systemek1 ] ) and ( [ systemek2 ] ) still poses serious technical difficulties : namely , these equations are non - linear with respect to the tp velocity , which enters the gradient term on the rhs of the evolution equations for the pair correlation , and does depend itself on the values of the monolayer particles densities in the immediate vicinity of the tp .",
    "below we discuss a solution to this non - linear problem , focusing on the limit @xmath8 .",
    "we turn to the limit @xmath20 and suppose that both the density profiles and stationary velocity of the tp have non - trivial stationary values @xmath101 define next the local deviations of @xmath63 from the unperturbed density as @xmath102 choosing that @xmath103 , we obtain then the following fundamental system of equations : @xmath104 which holds for all @xmath62 except for @xmath105 , while for the special sites adjacent to the tp , i.e. for @xmath106 , one has @xmath107 equations ( [ systemeh1 ] ) and ( [ systemeh2 ] ) determine the deviation from the unperturbed density @xmath18 in the stationary state . note",
    "also that in virtue of the symmetry relations in eqs.([s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "now , our general approach to solution of coupled non - linear eqs.([vitesse]),([systemeh1 ] ) and ( [ systemeh2 ] ) is as follows : we first derive a general solution of these equations supposing that @xmath0 is a given parameter , or , in other words , assuming that the coefficients @xmath110 entering eqs.([systemeh1 ] ) and ( [ systemeh2 ] ) are known . in doing so",
    ", we obtain @xmath111 in the parametrized form @xmath112 then , substituting into eq.([ha ] ) particular values @xmath113 and making use of the definition of @xmath114 in eq.([defa ] ) , we find a system of three linear equations with three unknown coefficients of the form @xmath115 where @xmath116 , which will allow us to define all @xmath110 ( and hence , all @xmath117 .",
    "finally , substituting the results into eq.([vitesse ] ) , which can be written down in terms of @xmath110 as @xmath118 we will arrive at a closed - form equation determining implicitly the stationary velocity .",
    "equations ( [ systemeh1 ] ) and ( [ systemeh2 ] ) can be most conveniently solved by introducing the generating function for the density profiles of the form @xmath119 where @xmath120 . multiplying both sides of eqs.([systemeh1 ] ) and",
    "( [ systemeh2 ] ) by @xmath121 , and performing summations over @xmath122 and @xmath123 we find that @xmath124 is given explicitly by @xmath125 where @xmath126 and @xmath127 equations ( [ adevelopper ] ) to ( [ defk ] ) determine the generation function for the density profiles exactly , and the latter can be explicitly obtained via standard inversion formulae .",
    "as we have already remarked , the presence of the driven tp induces an inhomogeneous density distribution in the monolayer .",
    "one can thus pose a natural question whether equilibrium between adsorption and desorption processes gets shifted due to such a perturbancy , i.e. whether the equilibrium density in the monolayer is different from that given by eq.([rhostat ] ) .",
    "the answer is trivially `` no '' in the case when the particles number is explicitly conserved , but in the general case with arbitrary @xmath14 and @xmath15 this is not at all evident : similarly to the behavior in one - dimensional system @xcite , one expects that also in two - dimensions the density profiles are asymmetric as seen from the stationary moving tp and are characterized by a condensed , `` traffic - jam''-like region in front of and a depleted region past the tp .",
    "one anticipates then that the desorption events are favored in front of the tp , while the adsorption events are evidently suppressed by the excess density . on the other hand , past the tp desorption is diminished due to the particles depletion while adsorption may proceed more readily due to the same reason .",
    "it is thus not at all clear @xmath128 whether these two effects can compensate each other exactly , in view of a possible asymmetry of the density profiles , as it happens in the one - dimensional model @xcite .    for this purpose",
    ", we study the behavior of the integral deviation @xmath129 of the density from the equilibrium value @xmath130 , i.e. @xmath131 which can be computed straightforwardly from eqs.([adevelopper ] ) and ( [ defk ] ) by setting both @xmath132 and @xmath133 equal to unity . noticing that @xmath134 , and that @xmath135 , i.e. is strictly negative as soon as adsorption / desorption processes are present , we obtain then that @xmath129 is stricly equal to 0 . this implies , in turn , that the perturbancy of the density distribution in the monolayer created by the driven tp does not shift the global balance between the adsorption and desorption events . an analogous result has been obtained for the one - dimensional problem in ref.@xcite .",
    "inversion of the generating function with respect to @xmath133 can be readily performed by expanding @xmath124 into the series in powers of @xmath133 . to do this , we first rewrite @xmath124 as @xmath136 then , the sum on the right - hand - side of eq.([dev ] )",
    "can be further expanded as @xmath137 where @xmath138 stands for the binomial coefficients .",
    "next , gathering the terms with the same power of @xmath133 on the two sides of eq .",

    ", we rewrite the integral involved in eq.([repint ] ) using the definition in eq.([i ] ) as @xmath155 where @xmath156 one recognizes then ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the rhs of eq .",

    "this special random walk is characterized by @xmath161 - the structure factor ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which defines a biased random walk with the following elementary jump probabilities @xmath162 @xmath163 hence , @xmath151 can be interpreted as @xmath164 and thus can be thought of as the generating function of a two - dimensional biased random walk .",
    "equations ( [ sert ] ) to ( [ y ] ) allow us to deduce an asymptotical behavior of the density profiles in front of and past the stationary moving tp . to do this , note first that these asymptotic forms of @xmath165 with @xmath166 can be most straightforwardly obtained from the generating function of @xmath165 : @xmath167 which we proceed now to calculate . using eqs.([sert ] ) and ( [ y ] ) , we find that @xmath168 where the roots @xmath169 are defined as @xmath170 @xmath171 @xmath172 @xmath173 which obey @xmath174 in consequence , @xmath175 is a holomorphic function in the annular region of inner radius @xmath176 and the outer radius @xmath177 .",
    "as explained in appendix b , the behavior of @xmath165 when @xmath178 ( resp .",
    "@xmath179 ) is controled by @xmath177 ( resp .",
    "@xmath180 ) .",
    "the asymptotical behavior of the density profiles in front of the tp is supported by the behavior of the generating function @xmath175 in the vincinity of @xmath177 ( see apendix b for more details ) .",
    "we find then that for @xmath178 the density obeys @xmath181 which means that in front of the tp the deviation @xmath165 decays exponentially with the distance , @xmath182 where the decay amplitude obeys @xmath183 while the characteristic decay length is given by @xmath184 note that here @xmath185 is finite for any values of the system parameters .",
    "we first note that one of the roots of the generating function , namely @xmath176 , gets equal to unity when both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are strictly equal to zero , which results in the exact cancellation of the multiplier @xmath186 both in the nominator and the denominator in the first term on the rhs of eq.([expressionn ] ) .",
    "this signifies that in the limit when exchanges with the reservoir are forbidden , the singular behavior of the generating function at the vicinity of @xmath176 is essentially different compared to the case when both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are greater than zero .",
    "consequently , one has to consider separately the behavior in the case of non - conserved particles number , when exchanges with the reservoir persist , and the case when both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equal to zero while their ratio is kept fixed .",

    "while the former case has been studied in detail in ref.@xcite , the results for the latter case have been only briefly outlined in ref.@xcite . in the next section we present detailed derivation of the limiting form of the force - velocity relation in case of a vanishingly small external force .",

    "is thus given explicitly by @xmath235 hence , the discontinuity @xmath222 in the monolayer particles density in the immediate vicinity of the tp equals , by virtue of eq.([paire ] ) , twice the expression on the right - hand - side of eq.([fricequivh ] ) .",
    "expanding the tp velocity @xmath0 in the taylor series in powers of @xmath7 and again , retaining only linear with @xmath7 terms , we get @xmath236 next , making use of eqs.([paire ] ) and ( [ fricequivh ] ) , we arrive at the following explicit result @xmath237 which signifies that in the limit of a vanishingly small external bias the frictional force exerted on the tp by the monolayer particles is viscous . note also that eq.([v ] ) is quite similar to the well - known stokes formula , i.e. @xmath238 , and in our case the friction coefficient @xmath239 is given explicitly by @xmath240 note now that the friction coefficient @xmath239 is the sum of two contributions . the first one",
    ", @xmath241 is a typical mean - field - type result and corresponds to a perfectly homogeneous monolayer ( see discussion following eq.(6 ) ) .",
    "the second one , @xmath242 has , however , a more complicated origin .",
    "namely , it is associated with the cooperative behavior emerging in the monolayer - dehomogenization of the particle distribution in the adsorbed monolayer due to the presence of a driven impurity ( the tp ) and formation of stationary density profiles , whose characteristic properties depend on the velocity @xmath0 .",
    "lastly , assuming _ a priori _ that the einstein relation holds for the system under study , we estimate the tp diffusion coefficient @xmath243 as @xmath244 it seems now interesting to compare our general result in eq.([2dautodiffgen ] ) against the classical result of nakazato and kitahara @xcite , which describes tp diffusion coefficient in a two - dimensional lattice gas with conserved particles number . setting @xmath14 and @xmath15 equal to zero , while assuming that their ratio has a fixed value , @xmath245 , we have then that @xmath246 noticing next that @xmath247 where @xmath248 has been defined by eq.([defp ] ) , and using the fact that @xcite @xmath249 we find that the right - hand - side of eq.([d ] ) attains the form @xmath250 which expression is exactly the same as the one obtained earlier in refs.@xcite and @xcite within the framework of different , compared to our approach , analytical techniques . the result in eq.([comparnaka ] ) is known to be exact in the limits @xmath251 and @xmath252 , and serves as a very good approximation for the self - diffusion coefficient in hard - core lattice gases of arbitrary density @xcite .",
    "to conclude , we have studied analytically the intrinsic frictional properties of 2d adsorbed monolayers , composed of mobile hard - core particles undergoing continuous exchanged with the vapor .",
    "our analytical approach has been based on the master equation , describing the time evolution of the system , which has allowed us to evaluate a system of coupled dynamical equations for the tracer particle velocity and a hierarchy of correlation functions . to solve these coupled equations ,",
    "we have invoked an approximate closure scheme based on the decomposition of the third - order correlation functions into a product of pairwise correlations , which has been first introduced in ref.@xcite for a related model of a driven tracer particle dynamics in a one - dimensional lattice gas with conserved particles number . within the framework of this approximation",
    ", we have derived a system of coupled , discrete - space equations describing evolution of the density profiles in the adsorbed monolayer , as seen from the moving tracer , and its velocity @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that the density profile around the tracer is strongly inhomogeneous : the local density of the adsorbed particles in front of the tracer is higher than the average and approaches the average value as an exponential function of the distance from the tracer .",
    "on the other hand , past the tracer the local density is always lower than the average , and depending on whether the number of particles is explicitly conserved or not , the local density past the tracer may tend to the average value either as an exponential or even as an @xmath9 function of the distance .",
    "the latter reveals especially strong memory effects and strong correlations between the particle distribution in the environment and the carrier position .",
    "next , we have derived a general force - velocity relation , which defines the terminal velocity of the tracer particle for arbitrary applied fields and arbitrary values of other system parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated next that in the limit of a vanishingly small external bias this relation attains a simple , but physically meaningful form of the stokes formula , which signifies that in this limit the frictional force exerted on the tracer by the adsorbed monolayer particles is viscous .",
    "corresponding friction coefficient has been also explicitly determined .",
    "in addition , we estimated the self - diffusion coefficient of the tracer in the absence of the field and showed that it reduces to the well - know result of refs.@xcite and @xcite in the limit when the particles number is conserved .",
