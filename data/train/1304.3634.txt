    "figure taken from @xcite . ]    0.8    between the fireball center and the surrounding vacuum , these fireballs undergo explosive collective expansion , cooling down rapidly through several different states of matter , finally fragmenting into thousands of free - streaming hadrons whose energy and momentum distributions can be detected in the detectors set up around the collider rings .",
    "the evolution history of these `` little bangs '' has much similarity with the big bang that created our universe ( fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) : both undergo hubble - like expansion , feature a hierarchy of decoupling processes that are driven by the expansion dynamics ( and not by the finite geometric size of the little bang ) , with chemical decoupling of the finally observed particle abundances preceding kinetic decoupling , and with initial - state quantum fluctuations ( shown in figures  [ f2 ] and [ f3 ] ) imprinting themselves ( left ) and [ f3 ] ( top ) , and ultimately into today s distributions of stars , galaxies , and galaxy clusters and superclusters ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ) . in the little bang ,",
    "they evolve through viscous hydrodynamics into the measured anisotropic collective flow patterns and their event - by - event fluctuations that are the subject of this overview . ] onto the experimentally observed final state .",
    "of course , the big and little bangs are quite different in other aspects : their expansion rates differ by about 18 orders of magnitude ; the little bang s expansion is 3-dimensional and driven by pressure gradients , not 4-dimensional and controlled by gravity ; little bangs evolve on time scales of ioctoseconds , not billions of years ; distances are measured in femtometers rather than light years .",
    "most importantly , the little bang standard model is still under construction .",
    "this overview discusses recent progress of the edifice .",
    "we can observe only one big bang ( the one that produced our universe ) , but at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and large hadron collider ( lhc ) we have experimentally created and studied billions of little bangs .",
    "each little bang is different : highly successful phenomenology based on hydrodynamic evolution models @xcite has taught us that the initially very dense quark - gluon matter created in heavy - ion collisions reaches approximate local thermal equilibrium on a very short time scale @xcite of order 1fm/@xmath0 ( 3 ioctoseconds ) , after which it evolves according to the macroscopic laws of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics .",
    "pressure gradients in the fluctuating density profile ( see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] for a specific example ) are the hydrodynamic forces that accelerate the fluid and cause it to expand and dilute .",
    "spatial anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the initial density profile transverse to the beam direction lead to corresponding anisotropies in the final transverse expansion flow velocity profile that are imprinted on the momenta of the experimentally observed particles emitted from the collision .",
    "each little bang features its own final flow velocity profile which ( within hydrodynamics ) is a deterministic classical response to the initial conditions that fluctuate from collision to collision due to quantum fluctuations in the initial nuclear wave function .",
    "we now know that the quark - gluon liquid that makes up the matter of the little bang during the first half of its life has very small viscosity , behaving like an almost ideal fluid @xcite .",
    "this is a fantastic gift of nature since it allows us to study experimentally the spectrum of initial - state quantum fluctuations through the final - state anisotropic flow fluctuations .",
    "had the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) turned out to be highly viscous , all initial - state fluctuations would have been wiped out by dissipation before final decoupling of the emitted particles , thereby closing this observation window on the initial state of the little bang and on the quantum nature of the initial energy deposition process .",
    "0.8    the little bang pressure @xmath4 is related to its energy density @xmath5 by its equation of state ( eos ) , and the anisotropy of the initial pressure gradients can be characterized by a series of harmonic eccentricity coefficients @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the initial energy density distribution in the plane transverse to the beam direction .",
    "@xmath8 characterizes the magnitude of the @xmath9th harmonic deformation coefficient , and the angle @xmath10 gives the direction of the corresponding deformation component in the lab frame .",
    "both the magnitudes @xmath8 and their orientations @xmath10 fluctuate from event to event .",
    "the mean values @xmath11 averaged over many events from three popular initial energy deposition models ( see @xcite for a description and original references ) are shown as a function of harmonic index @xmath9 in the left bottom panel of fig .",
    "they represent the primordial temperature fluctuation spectrum of the little bang .",
    "we see that each collision centrality generates a different class of little bangs , with its own @xmath11 power spectrum , and that the three models shown give quite different results for these power spectra .",
    "if we can somehow measure the centrality dependence of the initial @xmath11 power spectrum , we have a powerful constraint on the initial nuclear quark and gluon wave functions on our hands .",
    "this is reminiscent of the crucial role the cmb temperature power spectrum ( shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) has played in nailing down the parameters of the standard model of big bang cosmology .",
    "the hydrodynamic response to the initial @xmath8-spectrum of the little bang is reflected in the observed transverse momentum distributions @xmath12 of the various emitted hadronic species @xmath13 , and in correlations among them",
    ". the transverse momentum spectra can again be characterized by a set of complex harmonic coefficients @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the azimuthal angle around the beam direction of the particle s transverse momentum @xmath16 , and the curly brackets denote the average over particles from a single collision .",
    "each particle species @xmath13 has its own set of anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath17 .",
    "eq.([eq2 ] ) defines the flow coefficients and associated flow angles for the entire event , whereas eq.([eq3 ] ) is the analogous definition for the subset of particles in the event with a given magnitude of the transverse momentum @xmath18 .",
    "i suppress the dependence of both types of flow coefficients on the rapidity @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 are known as the `` integrated '' anisotropic flows , @xmath21 are called `` differential '' flows . by definition ,",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath21 are positive definite .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations show that in general the flow angles @xmath10 depend on @xmath18 , and that , as a function of @xmath18 , @xmath22 wanders around the `` average angle '' @xmath10 that characterizes the integrated flow @xmath20 of the entire event @xcite .    for each collision system , centrality class , and collision energy , the fluctuating initial state of the little bang",
    "is characterized by a distinct probability distribution @xmath23 , one particular moment of which is the @xmath11 power spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . for different @xmath9 ,",
    "the angles @xmath24 are more or less correlated with the direction of the impact parameter @xmath25 , but this direction can not be measured experimentally .",
    "the viscous hydrodynamic evolution relates the probability distribution for the initial complex eccentricity coefficients deterministically to probability distributions @xmath26 and @xmath27 for the integrated and differential final complex harmonic flow coefficients ; these distributions are particle species specific . as will be discussed in the next section , the relation between the final complex flow coefficients @xmath17 and the initial eccentricity coefficients @xmath28 ( and thus between the corresponding flow and eccentricity probability distributions characterizing each class of collisions ) depends on the viscosity of the little bang matter .",
    "one goal of the relativistic heavy - ion program is to both constrain the qgp viscosity and identify the correct theory for the initial - state quantum fluctuations by performing a complete experimental reconstruction of the final multi - dimensional distributions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .    due to limited statistics arising from the finite number of particles emitted by each little bang , neither the magnitudes @xmath20 nor the flow angles @xmath10 can be accurately determined for a single event .",
    "experimental flow measures therefore involve angle correlations between two or more particles ; for example , @xmath29\\rangle$ ] where the first particle from the event has transverse momentum @xmath30 and the second particle has @xmath31 , the average @xmath32 is over all such particles in the event and @xmath33 indicates the average of the result over many little bangs of the selected class .",
    "one sees that the event - by - event fluctuations and transverse momentum dependences of both the anisotropic flow magnitudes @xmath20 and their associated flow angles @xmath10 affect these experimental observables .",
    "different such observables correspond to different correlation functions between the @xmath20 s and @xmath10 s all of which can , for a given initial energy deposition model with probability distribution @xmath23 , be computed from the hydrodynamically predicted probability distributions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "one can define experimental observables that separate the fluctuations of the anisotropic flow magnitudes @xmath21 from those in the flow angles @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "these should be powerful discriminators between different @xmath26 and @xmath27 distributions , and thus between different initial - state fluctuation models .",
    "experimental studies of these @xmath20 and @xmath10 fluctuations and their @xmath18-dependences have just gotten under way ; the results will be interesting and should significantly advance the construction of the little bang standard model .    0.8    the angles @xmath24 associated with the initial deformation parameters",
    "@xmath8 are not only correlated with the ( unmeasurable ) direction of the impact parameter @xmath25 , but also with each other , in ways that are predicted by ( and thus depend on ) the initial energy deposition model @xcite .",
    "these so - called participant - plane correlations in the initial state are translated by hydrodynamic response into final - state flow angle correlations .",
    "these flow angle correlations were measured in pb+pb collisions at the lhc by the alice @xcite and atlas @xcite collaborations . all measured two- and three - plane flow angle correlations @xcite",
    "are qualitatively reproduced by viscous hydrodynamic calculations , both in their magnitudes and centrality dependences @xcite ( right panels in fig .",
    "they differ , however , qualitatively from the initial participant - plane correlations @xcite , often even in sign ( left panels in fig .",
    "hydrodynamic evolution is nonlinear and leads to mode - coupling between different harmonics @xcite .",
    "for example , elliptic and triangular deformations @xmath34 and @xmath35 provide a nonlinear contribution to pentangular flow @xmath36 which , for large impact parameters where the elliptic deformation @xmath34 is big , overwhelms the linear response to @xmath37 and completely decorrelates the pentangular flow plane @xmath38 from the angle @xmath39 of the initial pentangular density deformation @xcite . only by accounting for mode - coupling ,",
    "either directly by following the non - linear hydrodynamic evolution @xcite or through a non - linear response analysis that keeps at least second - order terms @xcite , can the experimental data be reproduced .",
    "these flow - plane correlations thus represent an _ experimentum crucis _ in support of the hydrodynamic paradigm for the little bang ; dynamical models without a large degree of local thermalization and hydrodynamic collective flow will not be able to describe the dynamical change of character between the initial - state participant - plane and final - state flow - plane correlations @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the fluid to convert spatial anisotropies in the pressure gradients into anisotropic flows is degraded by shear viscosity .",
    "the `` conversion efficiency '' @xmath40 is therefore a measure for the specific shear viscosity @xmath41 of the expanding fluid .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "higher harmonics , reflecting variations on smaller spatial scales , are suppressed more strongly by shear viscosity than lower flow harmonics .",
    "0.8    the azimuthally symmetric part of the collective transverse flow , called radial flow , boosts particles from low to high transverse momentum in proportion to their masses ; it is thus responsible for the distribution of the hydrodynamically generated momentum anisotropies over the various particle species and in @xmath18 @xcite . to correctly describe the differential anisotropic flows @xmath21 , for all charged hadrons or for specific identified hadron species ,",
    "thus requires that the total hydrodynamic momentum anisotropy ( which `` measures '' @xmath41 ) , the radial flow ( which is also sensitive to bulk viscosity that suppresses radial flow @xcite ) , and the chemical composition of the system at final decoupling ( which reflects the kinetics of chemical freeze - out ) are _ all _ correctly described by the model . by analyzing instead the total flow anisotropies @xmath42 of _ all _",
    "charged hadrons , integrated over @xmath18 , one can strongly reduce the model sensitivity to bulk viscosity and final chemical composition and obtain a much more robust estimate of @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the left panel in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] shows such an extraction of @xmath41 from elliptic flow data .",
    "the vishnu model used for this extraction couples the viscous hydrodynamic evolution of the qgp phase to a microscopic kinetic evolution of the hadronic phase after hadronization , thereby eliminating many uncertainties in earlier simplified calculations that described the hadronic phase macroscopically , too .",
    "the different theoretical lines show that , for a given initial energy deposition model , @xmath43 is _ only _ sensitive to the specific qgp shear viscosity .",
    "once @xmath44 has been adjusted to the measured total charged hadron elliptic flow as in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ( resulting in @xmath45 for mc - kln and ( @xmath46 for mc - glauber initial conditions ) , one finds that the model also correctly describes the @xmath18-spectra and differential elliptic flows @xmath47 of all charged hadrons together , as well as for specific identified hadron species ( pions , kaons , protons ) , for all collision centralities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it correctly _ predicted _ the analogous observables for pb+pb collisions at the lhc @xcite , in particular an increased mass splitting between the differential elliptic flows for light and heavy hadrons @xcite .",
    "+    0.8    unfortunately , the two left panels in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] also show that different initial energy deposition models lead to very different estimates for @xmath44 , due to their different initial eccentricities @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that this model ambiguity can be resolved by analyzing simultaneously elliptic and triangular flow ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) data .",
    "this analysis eliminated the mc - kln model with @xmath50 as a viable candidate , and thereby demonstrated the power of a comprehensive set of anisotropic flow data to ( over)constrain the dynamical evolution model .",
    "unfortunately , the mc - glauber model did not enjoy a much longer life itself : the @xmath20 data ( @xmath51 ) from ultra - central pb+pb collisions shown by cms at _ quark matter 2012 _ ( see the right bottom plot in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) and the event - by - event @xmath20 probability distributions ( @xmath52 ) measured by atlas and shown at the same conference @xcite ( see the right panel in fig .  [ f7 ] ) can not simultaneously be described by viscous hydrodynamics for _ any _ choice of @xmath44 if initial fluctuation spectra from either of these two models ( mc - kln and mc - glauber ) are used .",
    "fortunately , a new and much more successful initial - state model saved the day : the ip - glasma model @xcite , based on the color glass condensate idea @xcite , implements gluonic field fluctuations inside nucleons @xcite as well as gluon saturation effects @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] , these ip - glasma initial conditions ( represented by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] , lower left panel ) , when ( after a short initial pre - equilibrium stage modeled by classical yang - mills evolution ) evolved with viscous fluid dynamics , reproduce the entire measured spectrum of charged hadron anisotropic flow coefficients @xmath20 , both integrated over and differential in @xmath18 , for all collision centralities , as well as the measured @xcite event - by - event distribution of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath53 , again for a range of collision centralities @xcite .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] for pb+pb collisions at the lhc but also holds for au+au collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "the only difference is that for lhc energies the effective specific shear viscosity of the qgp fluid must be chosen somewhat larger ( @xmath54 ) than at top rhic energy ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "both data sets are consistent with a temperature dependent specific shear viscosity @xmath56 proposed in @xcite ( the thin lines in the lower left panel in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) that has a minimum value around @xmath57 at the pseudocritical temperature @xmath58 where the qgp hadronizes and then rises to about 5 times that minimal value at @xmath59 .",
    "while this temperature - dependence of @xmath41 is not yet tightly constrained by the available analyses of rhic and lhc data , the need for a somewhat larger effective shear viscosity at the higher temperatures probed at the lhc , already noted in earlier work @xcite , appears to solidify , and the early evidence from rhic data for a very low specific shear viscosity near @xmath58 @xcite , perhaps as low as the kss bound @xcite of @xmath60 , is strongly supported by the work in @xcite .",
    "the little bang standard model is still under construction , but its key features are showing through the scaffolding : * 1 . *  every heavy - ion collision system , centrality class , and collision energy generates a different class of little bangs , each with its own characteristic initial density fluctuation and final anisotropic flow fluctuation spectrum .",
    "the initial fluctuation spectrum can be computed from the color glass condensate ( cgc ) theory using e.g. the ip - glasma model ; gluon field fluctuations inside the nucleons within the colliding nuclei play an essential role in this spectrum .",
    "* 3 . *  after a very short pre - equilibrium evolution stage , not lasting much longer than 1fm/@xmath0 , which is best described using classical yang - mills field dynamics corrected for quantum fluctuations , the little bangs are in the qgp phase which undergoes viscous hydrodynamic evolution until it has cooled down to the pseudo - critical temperature for hadronization , @xmath61mev .",
    "the specific qgp shear viscosity is small , around @xmath60 near @xmath58 , rising modestly at higher temperatures ; its effective value for 200@xmath1gev au+au collisions at rhic is around @xmath62 , for 2.76@xmath1tev pb+pb collisions it is around @xmath63 .",
    "this small shear viscosity allows flow anisotropies to build in response to the initial fluctuations and anisotropies in the pressure gradients , to values that are large enough to be experimentally observed in the final state but still visibly attenuated by shear viscous effects , following an @xmath41-dependent pattern where higher harmonic flow coefficients are suppressed more strongly than lower harmonics .",
    "the spectrum of flow anisotropies , their magnitudes , directions , particle species and @xmath18-dependences , and event - by - event fluctuations provide a rich menu of experimental observables from which the qgp shear viscosity and initial fluctuation spectra can be reconstructed .",
    "*  after hadronization , the little bang continues to evolve as a dilute , highly dissipative hadron resonance gas that is highly inefficient in generating any additional momentum anisotropies but also does nt erase those established earlier during the qgp phase .",
    "this makes it possible to extract from hadronic final state observables quantitative information about the earlier qgp and cgc phases .    in this relatively simple form",
    ", the little bang standard model applies to little bangs created at top rhic and lhc energies . at lower collision energies ,",
    "our understanding of the initial conditions becomes less reliable and the lifetime of the hydrodynamic qgp stage shrinks , making a quantitative theory of the little bang more challenging , but not less interesting .",
