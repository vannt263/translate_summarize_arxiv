    "actual food webs are usually large and complex graphs and although their structure alone is not always enough to predict whether extinctions will occur or which species will eventually dominate , understanding the role of the specific local modules ( hierarchical , tree - like , loop , dangling ends , etc ) is important when modeling competing populations .",
    "the existence of closed , oriented loops , in which the @xmath4 species are not ranked , is believed to be an important mechanism fostering persistent coexistence in the presence of competition among species . in this case , each species is eventually replaced by a predator in a cyclic manner  @xcite . for @xmath0 , several partially overlapping cycles are possible , and the larger @xmath4 is , the harder it is to identify the whole ensemble of interactions .",
    "indeed , observing these trophic networks in real systems , and resolving the effects of its topology and internal dynamics from noisy external causes is not a simple task .",
    "it is thus not surprising that most of the observed examples are for small @xmath4  @xcite : mating lizards  @xcite , competing bacteria  @xcite , coral reef environments  @xcite , competing grasses  @xcite , etc .",
    "it remains necessary , tough , to systematically study which properties are robust when @xmath4 is large and which are specific of systems with a small number of species .    for @xmath5 , the simplest and well studied rock - scissors - paper ( rsp ) game ,",
    "the interaction graph is a three vertices , single loop oriented graph in which all three species interact with each other .",
    "a direct generalization  @xcite considers an oriented ring with @xmath0 , @xmath6 and , while nearest neighbors species along the ring interact , the others are mutually neutral . in particular , @xmath7 is the simplest case in which neutral pairs may form non interacting , passive alliances that prevent or delay invasions  @xcite . on the other hand , active defensive alliances   may appear among non mutually neutral species ( cyclic alliances ) when the interaction graph has more than a single loop  @xcite .",
    "this is obtained , for @xmath7 , by introducing crossed interactions with rate @xmath8 ( see fig .  [ fig.graph ] ) , that turn the ring into a fully connected graph and break not only its full intransitivity  @xcite but also the equal number of predators and preys symmetry . in spite of that , this model still presents a four species coexistence phase for not too large values of @xmath8 : beyond a threshold @xmath9 , the weakest species gets extinct and the food web changes to an inhomogeneous rsp game .    while the system had not yet attained an absorbing state , local oscillations are observed as each agent is eventually replaced by one of its predators .",
    "that is , each site is a simple oscillator as strategies cycle in a sequence obbeying the food web . in the square lattice ,",
    "two of these oscillators , located at sites far apart , are not able to have these oscillations in phase . indeed , the short range interactions are not able to build correlations involving large portions of the system and when the global densities are evaluated , these phase differences average out and the system attains a fixed point ( up to finite size fluctuations ) , that is , no oscillations in global densities are observed . in analogy to epidemiological models",
    "@xcite , upon the introduction of long range interactions for @xmath5 , since the average path length between sites becomes much smaller , global synchronization becomes possible and there is a hopf bifurcation from the fixed point to a limit cycle  @xcite . for more complex food webs , @xmath0 , with the simultaneous presence of several possible loops , and the possibility that distinct regions of a spatially distributed system follow different subcycles , it is not a priori obvious whether well separated regions would be able to synchronize .",
    "this poses the question of the very existence of the hopf bifurcation and whether global oscillations may be stable or not under the presence of several possible local cycles .",
    "would they require a stronger correlation between distant regions and , as a consequence , a larger amount of long range connections ?",
    "moreover , whether there is a larger or smaller species diversity when long range interactions are introduced seems to strongly depend on the details of the updating rule chosen to model the individual interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus , further important points are to understand to what extent the coexistence state is robust against both the change in the range of the interactions and the presence of global oscillations and how these results may be extended to other @xmath0 systems .    in order to address the above questions , we study the @xmath7 system introduced in ref .  @xcite and consider a simple network that interpolates between the local , square lattice , and the non local random graph . in sec .  [ section.model ] we introduce the model and describe the topology of the food web and the spatial network . then , in sec .  [ section.results ] we present our results and , finally , discuss and present our conclusions in sec .  [ section.conclusions ] .",
    "the starting model consists of a fully intransitive system of four species ( or strategies ) , identified from 0 to 3 , such that the species @xmath10 outcompetes the species @xmath11 , that is , @xmath12 ( 0123 , for short ) with uniform , unitary rate .",
    "we break the mutual neutrality of species @xmath13 and @xmath14 by adding crossed interactions with a tunable rate @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig.graph ] ) . whenever @xmath16 , some hierarchy is present since the subloops 123 and 012 are transitive while 013 and 023 remain intransitive .",
    "also , the symmetry of the graph is broken : while all species are equivalent if @xmath2 ( one prey , one predator each ) , for @xmath17 they separate into two groups : species 0 and 1 have two preys and one predator , while species 2 and 3 have two predators and one prey .",
    "this strong hierarchy is attenuated by the fact that , even if species 2 and 3 have only one prey each , they always subjugate them , while species 0 and 1 can sometimes fail if @xmath18 . indeed , several recent works ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have shown that the structure of the interaction graph alone is not enough to predict the asymptotic temporal evolution of the system , stressing the importance of the invasion rates .",
    "are the corresponding rates  @xcite.,width=188 ]    since we are mainly concerned with the effects of spatial correlations , the model will be studied , through monte carlo simulations , on a regular graph with both short and long range interactions and a constant number @xmath19 of individuals .",
    "we start with a square lattice and periodic boundary conditions and , without changing the coordination number , replace a fraction @xmath1 of randomly chosen short range connections with long range ones following the rewiring process detailed in ref .",
    "while intermediate @xmath1 produces a small world network , @xmath20 recovers the square lattice and @xmath21 a random regular graph or bethe lattice ( since typical loops , involving @xmath22 sites , become irrelevant in the thermodynamical limit ) .",
    "starting from the square lattice , we choose a site and one of its nearest neighbors .",
    "the link between them is opened and reconnected to another randomly chosen , non nearest - neighbor site ( self interactions are excluded ) .",
    "this last site now has an extra connection and , in order to keep the coordination constant , we remove one of its local connections .",
    "we now take the site with one neighbor missing and reconnect it with another randomly chosen site .",
    "the process is repeated until the fraction @xmath1 is reached and the graph is closed by connecting the last link freed to the missing link site of the first step . once the rewiring finishes , no further modification in the network occurs , that is , it is quenched .",
    "there are , of course , other ways of introducing long range interactions in the system .",
    "we chose , however , this rewiring algorithm , that replaces short by long range interactions , in order to a ) reproduce previous results , b ) keep the graph regular ( assuming that in a time step , each agent performs a constant number of interactions ) and c ) interpolate between the square lattice and the random regular graph .",
    "the system is equally populated with all four strategies at time @xmath23 . during the time evolution , one site and one of its four neighbors",
    "are randomly chosen and their strategies are updated following the graph of fig .",
    "[ fig.graph ] : the predator replaces the prey with the corresponding rate , either 1 or @xmath8 . the time unit , one monte carlo step ( mcs ) , corresponds to @xmath19 such updating attempts .",
    "we measure the density of each strategy along the trajectory and the results below are obtained from these temporal series .",
    "this purely competitive , serial dynamics does not take into account other relevant ingredients like decoupling the reproduction and predation steps , swapping or displacement of agents , mutation , etc , although it could be extended to included them  @xcite .",
    "finite systems following the dynamics described in the previous section present a sequence of extinction events , eventually attaining an absorbing , homogeneous state with a single species .",
    "these extinctions , by removing nodes and links , also change the food web , making it simpler . nonetheless , the dependence of a conveniently defined average extinction time @xmath24 on the system size @xmath19 is useful to characterize the different dynamical phases of the model  @xcite .",
    "these phases have diverse levels of diversity with either one , three or four species coexisting  @xcite . for the transition from four to three coexisting species phases , the timescale of the first extinction is the relevant one  @xcite , while for the transition to an homogeneous state is the last extinction that matters .",
    "the coexistence is said to be stable when the related deterministic dynamics presents a stable attractor in the coexistence phase , and this is associated with an exponentially increasing time for the first extinction away from the coexistence state to occur as @xmath19 increases .",
    "analogously , the unstable state presents only a logarithmic increase of the extinction time and the deterministic system approaches an absorbing state . in between , a power law dependence of the extinction time on the system size",

    "the former was studied in ref .",

    "the timescale of the first extinction grows , respectively , exponential or logarithmically with @xmath19 .",
    "an example of the time evolution , starting from the homogeneous state , @xmath35 ( black dot ) , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.simplex]a .",
    "the orbit is confined to a small region around the attracting fixed point ( the small volume is due to finite size fluctuations ) . for the random graph ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "on the other hand , species 2 always becomes extinct in the early stages of the dynamics ( both species 2 and 3 have two predators , but those of species 2 have two preys and are strong ) and the possible asymptotic phases have one or three species , for small or large @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the relevant timescale is the time to attain the absorbing state , and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.tau_q1_chi ] . above the threshold , after an initial sublinear dependence on @xmath19 ( up to a crossover size , the minima in fig .",
    "[ fig.tau_q1_chi ] , for @xmath36 ) , @xmath24 enters an exponential regime .",
    "the location of the minimum grows very fast as @xmath8 approaches the threshold and seems to diverge for some value in the interval @xmath37 . for smaller values of @xmath8",
    ", there is no longer a minimum .",
    "this three species phase for large @xmath8 also occurs for @xmath20 .",
    "thus , for large @xmath8 , it extends over the whole interval , from @xmath20 to 1 .",
    "the level of transitivity in this case is too high to sustain four species and the food web turns into an heterogeneous rsp game ( 013 with rates 1 , @xmath8 and 1 , respectively ) . for small @xmath8 , on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior is reminiscent of @xmath2 , in which only one or 4 species coexistence are observed since there is no cross interactions ( although , in principle , two mutually neutral species are also possible ) . in this phase ,",
    "the growth of @xmath24 is rather slow ( logarithmic ) and , because extinctions are probable , the asymptotic state is the homogeneous , single species phase . interestingly , while for @xmath20 the system loses diversity when increasing @xmath8 , passing from four to three species , for @xmath21 it is the opposite , from the homogeneous single species to three coexisting ones .",
    "diversity decreases in the former and increases in the latter .",
    "@xmath19 for @xmath21 ( random graph ) . for this case",
    ", the system has two phases , with three or one surviving species and @xmath24 is the characteristic time to attain an absorbing state . notice the presence , for large @xmath8 , of a minimum of @xmath38 . before this minimum",
    ", @xmath24 depends sub - linearly on @xmath19 but crosses over to an exponential growth at sufficiently large sizes . for smaller values of @xmath8 , at least within the sizes and times considered here , no evidences of such a minimum were observed . at late times , there are two different regimes : if @xmath36 , @xmath39 , while for @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , the critical value seems to lie in the interval @xmath42.,width=302 ]    even more interesting is the behavior for a fixed @xmath8 as @xmath1 increases .",
    "there is a hopf transition at @xmath3 from the fixed point existing at small @xmath1 to an asymptotically stable limit cycle .",
    "two examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.simplex]b and c. in both cases , with both @xmath2 and 0.3 , the orbit approaches the four vertices in the order 0123 , following the outer loop of the food web . in the intransitive case , @xmath2 , fig .",
    "[ fig.simplex]c , the actual path approaches the heteroclinic orbit and the system is close to the transition to the absorbing state .",
    "these global oscillations , for not so high @xmath1 , are observed either both in the four and three species phases : while in the former the orbit is in the interior of the simplex , in the latter it is confined to one of its faces .",
    "once in the asymptotic state , one can measure the perimeter @xmath43 of each cycle ( between two consecutive crossings of the point representing the state of the system through a conveniently defined poincar section inside the simplex , we add up its displacement at each mc step ) .",
    "this is averaged over the whole evolution of the system and normalized by the perimeter of the heteroclinic orbit such that @xmath44 .",
    "[ fig.perimeter ] shows that the amplitude of the oscillations increases continuously with @xmath1 for different values of @xmath8 , analogously to the @xmath5 case  @xcite . above the threshold @xmath45 ,",
    "that is , inside the three species phase , @xmath32 remains smaller than its maximum value for all values of @xmath1 up to the random graph limit .",
    "in other words , the global oscillation phase extends up to @xmath21 , consistently with ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath32 inside the four species global oscillations phase , at small @xmath8 , is different as @xmath32 gets very close to unity , corresponding to an almost heteroclinic orbit ( see fig .  [ fig.simplex]c ) , very close to the faces of the tetrahedron .",
    "although it is not easy to precisely locate the transition to the absorbing state as very large systems are needed in this case , our results indicate that it indeed occurs for @xmath1 not much larger than 0.3 .",
    "thus , in this case the global phase exists only for intermediate values of @xmath1 for which @xmath46 .",
    "a final remark concerns the exponent with which @xmath32 goes to 0 at the transition from local to global oscillations . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.perimeter ] , for several values of @xmath8 , the declivity seems to be the same close to the transition and the exponent is 1/2 , that is , @xmath47 , consistent with a hopf bifurcation . the universality of the exponent is important : not only it does not seem to depend on the original lattice structure upon which long range connections were added but also on the complexity of the global cycle after the transition . whether this universal behavior is valid for even larger cycles , when @xmath48 , is an open question .     of the limit cycle as a function of @xmath1 for several values of @xmath8 .",
    "the point at which @xmath49 , @xmath50 , locates the hopf bifurcation from local to global oscillations .",
    "inset : log - log plot close to the transition showing that the exponent , 1/2 , does not depend on @xmath8.,width=302 ]    the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig.diagram ] summarizes the above results . when the amount of long range connections is small ( low @xmath1 ) only local oscillations are possible , whatever is the number of species in the coexistence state . upon increasing @xmath1",
    "there is a transition from local to global oscillations for all values of @xmath8 . for large @xmath8 , the three species global oscillations phase extends up to @xmath21 .",
    "the amount of long range interactions necessary to synchronize the oscillations , in this phase , decrease with @xmath8 : the more homogeneous the rsp food web is , the easier it is to synchronize distant regions . on the contrary , for small @xmath8 and above the local - global transition",
    ", the four species phase has another transition , to a homogeneous single species state ( and , obviously , no oscillations ) . for @xmath2",
    "the amount of long range connections necessary to present global oscillations is minimum because the food web , in this case , is a single loop .",
    "as @xmath8 increases inside this phase , one has @xmath51 until a maximum at the four - three species transition : the larger the level of transitivity of the food web is , the harder it is to synchronize .",
    "in other words , at the edge of the 4 - 3 transition , local oscillations are quite robust and a greater amount of long range connections are necessary in order to correlate different regions of the system . away from this point , either as @xmath52 or @xmath53 , that corresponds to the most homogeneous conditions , the amount of long range connections is minimum .",
    "another interesting feature of the phase diagram is that for the three species phase it is harder to get the global synchronization state as the necessary fraction of long range interactions is more than three times higher than in the four species phase .",
    "also , for @xmath54 , the local - global transition line is reentrant as a function of @xmath8 .     follows the @xmath20 case ( square lattice ) studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and has a transition from a four to three species coexistence state .",
    "since there is only short - range interactions , only local oscillations are present in both phases .",
    "there is a minimum amount of long - range connections , @xmath55 , necessary to synchronize these local oscillations throughout the system .",
    "interestingly , while the system presents coexistence of all four species ( and subloops in the food web are relevant ) , @xmath3 is smaller than in the three species phase . for even larger values of @xmath1 ,",
    "the four species phase is replaced by a less interesting single species , homogeneous phase.,width=302 ]",
    "transitivity and predation asymmetry are topological properties of oriented food webs that may prevent long term , stable coexistence within a population . both imply that the species are not all equivalent , but while the former is characterized by closed loops not being cyclic , the latter has species with a different number of preys and predators .",
    "full intransitivity and symmetry ( @xmath2 ) are , however , not always required as is exemplified by the four species coexistence in the model introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and studied both in mean field and , through simulations , on a regular lattice .",
    "locally , each site follows a periodic sequence of strategies allowed in the food web but these oscillations do not synchronize over long distances .",
    "here we have shown that upon introducing a finite fraction @xmath1 of long range interactions , well separated regions may synchronize their local cycles and generate global density oscillations through a hopf bifurcation even if the food web presents , in addition to multiple loops , some amount of transitivity and asymmetry .",
    "for all values of @xmath8 there is a transition from local to global oscillations occurring inside the coexistence phase .",
    "the behavior is different for small or large @xmath8 . for large @xmath8 , species",
    "2 always gets extinct and the remaining three species phase , reminiscent of the @xmath56 case , is stable irrespective of the value of @xmath1 .",
    "interestingly , the amount of long range connections necessary to synchronize the whole system decreases the larger @xmath8 is , that is , the more homogeneous the rsp cycle is . for @xmath2 , on the other hand , the only possible phases have either four or one species : in the absence of crossed interactions , once one species gets extinct , the food web is no longer cyclic and only the prey of the extinct species remains .",
    "this transition , from the four species coexistence to the absorbing state extends also for small @xmath8 and occurs when the amplitude of the limit cycle approaches the heteroclinic orbit .",
    "interestingly enough , the amount of long range interactions necessary to obtain global synchronization , @xmath55 , increases with @xmath8 inside the four species phase : the more transitive are some of the subloops , the harder it is to synchronize distant regions .",
    "again one has that the less homogeneous is the food web , the larger is the amount of long range interactions necessary to obtain synchronization .",
    "thus , @xmath55 presents a maximum close to the transition from three to four species , and it is harder to globally synchronize the density oscillations .",
    "moreover , when all the four species are present and the food web is more complex , the synchronization transition requires a smaller amount of long range interactions than for three species ( and a simpler food web ) , that is , @xmath55 is smaller in the four species phase .    at the two extremes of the phase diagram , @xmath2 and 1",
    ", the system reduces to a single loop food web with four and three species , respectively .",
    "the local to global transition occurs at @xmath57 and @xmath58 , that is , the threshold for @xmath7 is smaller than for @xmath5 . whether @xmath3 further decreases with increasing @xmath4 , approaching an effectively short range system with global oscillations as @xmath59 , and the interplay with the fixation that may happen for large @xmath4 are interesting questions that deserve further investigation .",
    "a first step towards the understanding of the complex behavior of large , cyclic trophic rings is done through simplified models going beyond the standard rsp game , as the one considered here .",
    "the very existence of the local to global oscillations transition , under broad conditions , in three and four species model , hints to the possibility that this is a general feature even in more complex , realistic food webs .",
    "thus , it would be important to study systems with more species ( @xmath48 ) in order to confirm the universality claim of the local to global oscillations phase .",
