    "rare regions are an important , if intricate , aspect of systems with impurities and defects . in recent years ,",
    "their influence on phase transitions and critical phenomena has reattracted considerable attention .",
    "rare region effects were first studied in the context of classical equilibrium phase transitions .",
    "griffiths @xcite showed that they lead to a singular free energy in an entire parameter region in the vicinity of the phase transition , now known as the griffiths region .",
    "however , in classical systems with uncorrelated disorder , this griffiths singularity in the free energy is an essential one and thus very weak and probably unobservable in experiment .",
    "disorder correlations generically increase the effects of impurities .",
    "therefore , stronger rare region effects have been found in classical systems with extended defects and in random quantum systems ( where the correlations are in imaginary time direction ) . in the random transverse field ising model @xcite , or equivalently , the classical mccoy - wu model @xcite , the griffiths singularity takes a power law form , accompanied by a diverging magnetic susceptibility in the griffiths region .",
    "very recently , it has been found that some phase transitions can even be completely destroyed by smearing when the rare regions order independently from the bulk system .",
    "this happens , e.g. , in a classical ising magnet with planar defects @xcite and in itinerant quantum ferromagnets @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of rare regions on _ nonequilibrium _ phase transitions with quenched spatial disorder .",
    "we concentrate on the prominent class of absorbing state phase transitions which separate active , fluctuating states from inactive , absorbing states where fluctuations cease entirely @xcite .",
    "the generic universality class for absorbing state transitions is directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite . according to a conjecture by janssen and grassberger @xcite , all absorbing state transitions with a scalar order parameter , short - range interactions , and no extra symmetries or conservation laws belong to this class .",
    "examples include the transitions in the contact process @xcite , catalytic reactions @xcite , interface growth @xcite , or turbulence @xcite .",
    "the effects of _ uncorrelated _ spatial disorder , i.e. , point - like defects , on the dp transition have been studied in some detail in the past . according to the harris criterion @xcite , the dp universality class is unstable against spatial disorder , because the ( spatial ) correlation length exponent @xmath0 violates the inequality @xmath1 for all spatial dimensionalities @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , in the corresponding field theory , spatial disorder leads to runaway flow of the renormalization group ( rg ) equations @xcite , destroying the dp behavior .",
    "several other studies @xcite agreed on the instability of dp against spatial disorder , but a consistent picture has been slow to evolve .",
    "recently , hooyberghs _",
    "_ applied the hamiltonian formalism @xcite to the contact process with spatial disorder @xcite .",
    "using a version of the ma - dasgupta - hu strong - disorder rg @xcite these authors showed that the transition ( at least for sufficiently strong disorder ) is controlled by an exotic infinite - randomness fixed point with activated rather than the usual power - law scaling .",
    "very recently , it has been suggested @xcite that extended spatial defects like dislocations , disordered layers , or grain boundaries can have an even more dramatic effect on nonequilibrium phase transitions in the dp universality class .",
    "rare region effects similar to but stronger than the usual griffiths phenomena @xcite actually destroy the sharp transition by smearing .",
    "this happens because rare strongly coupled spatial regions can undergo the transition independently from the bulk system .",
    "based on an extremal statistics approach it has been predicted @xcite that the spatial density distribution in the tail of the smeared transition is very inhomogeneous , with the average stationary density and the survival probability depending exponentially on the control parameter .    in the present paper we present results of extensive monte - carlo simulations of a two - dimensional contact process with linear spatial defects which provide numerical evidence for this smearing scenario in a realistic model with short - range couplings .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , we introduce the model and briefly summarize the results of the extremal statistics theory for the smeared phase transition . in section [ sec : montecarlo ] we present our simulation method and the numerical results together with a comparison to the theoretical predictions .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] by discussing the importance of our results and their generality .",
    "the contact process @xcite is a prototypical system in the directed percolation universality class .",
    "it can be interpreted , e.g. , as a model for the spreading of a disease .",
    "the contact process is defined on a @xmath3-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",
    "each lattice site @xmath4 can be active ( occupied by a particle ) or inactive ( empty ) . during the time evolution",
    ", active sites can infect their neighbors or they can spontaneously become inactive . specifically , particles are created at empty sites at a rate @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of active nearest neighbor sites and the ` birth rate ' @xmath7 is the control parameter .",
    "particles are annihilated at unit rate . for small birth rate @xmath7 , annihilation dominates , and the absorbing state without any particles is the only steady state ( inactive phase ) . for large birth rate @xmath7 , there is a steady state with finite particle density ( active phase ) .",
    "the two phases are separated by a nonequilibrium phase transition in the dp universality class at @xmath8",
    ".    quenched spatial disorder can be introduced by making the birth rate @xmath7 a random function of the lattice site .",
    "point - like defects are described by spatially uncorrelated disorder .",
    "we are interested in the case of extended defects which can be described by disorder perfectly correlated in @xmath9 dimensions , but uncorrelated in the remaining @xmath10 dimensions . here",
    "@xmath11 and 2 corresponds to linear and planar defects , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is a function of @xmath12 which is the projection of the position vector @xmath4 on the uncorrelated directions . for definiteness",
    ", we assume that the birthrate values @xmath13 are drawn from a binary probability distribution @xmath14 = ( 1-p)\\ , \\delta[\\lambda({\\mathbf r}_r)-\\lambda ] + p\\ , \\delta[\\lambda({\\mathbf r}_r ) - c\\lambda]\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants between 0 and 1 .",
    "in other words , there are extended impurities of spatial density @xmath15 where the birth rate @xmath7 is reduced by a factor @xmath16 .      in this subsection",
    ", we briefly summarize the arguments leading to the smearing of the phase transition and the predictions of the extremal statistics theory @xcite to the extent necessary for the comparison with the monte - carlo results .    in analogy to the griffiths phenomena",
    "@xcite , there is a small but finite probability @xmath17 for finding a large spatial region of linear size @xmath18 ( in the uncorrelated directions ) devoid of impurities . up",
    "to pre - exponential factors , this probability is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "these rare regions can be locally in the active phase , even if the bulk system is still in the inactive phase .",
    "since the impurities in our system are extended , each rare region is infinite in @xmath9 dimensions but finite in the remaining @xmath21 dimensions .",
    "this is a crucial difference to systems with uncorrelated disorder , where the rare regions are finite . in our system",
    ", each rare region can therefore undergo a true phase transition _ independently _ of the rest of the system at some @xmath22 . according to finite - size scaling @xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the clean ( @xmath3-dimensional ) finite - size scaling shift exponent and",
    "@xmath25 is the amplitude for the crossover from a @xmath3-dimensional bulk system to a ` slab ' infinite in @xmath9 dimensions but but finite in @xmath21 dimensions . if the total dimensionality @xmath26 , hyperscaling is valid , and @xmath27 which we assume from now on .",
    "the resulting global phase transition is very different from a conventional continuous phase transition , where a nonzero order parameter develops as a collective effect of the entire system , accompanied by a diverging correlation length in all directions .",
    "in contrast , in our system , the order parameter develops very inhomogeneously in space with different parts of the system ( i.e. , different @xmath28 regions ) ordering independently at different @xmath7 .",
    "correspondingly , the correlation length in the uncorrelated directions remains finite across the transition .",
    "this defines a smeared transition .    in order to determine the global system properties in the vicinity of the smeared transition , we combine ( [ eq : rr ] ) and ( [ eq : shift ] ) to obtain the probability for finding a rare region which becomes active at @xmath29 as @xmath30 for @xmath31 . here , @xmath32 .",
    "the total density @xmath33 ( the total number of active sites ) at a certain @xmath7 is obtained by summing over all active rare regions , i.e. , all regions with @xmath34 . since the functional dependence on @xmath7 of the density on any given active island is of power - law type",
    "it does not enter the leading exponentials but only the pre - exponential factors .",
    "thus , the stationary density develops an exponential tail , @xmath35 for all birth rates @xmath7 above the clean critical point @xmath36 .",
    "analogous arguments can be made for the survival probability @xmath37 ) of a single seed site .",
    "if the seed site is on an active rare region it will survive with a probability that depends on @xmath7 via a power law .",
    "if it is not on an active rare region , the seed will die . to exponential accuracy",
    "the survival probability is thus also given by ( [ eq : rho ] ) .",
    "the local spatial density distribution in the tail of the smeared transition is very inhomogeneous . on active rare regions ,",
    "the density is of the same order of magnitude as in the clean system . away from these regions",
    "it is exponentially small .",
    "we now turn to the dynamics in the tail of the smeared transition .",
    "the long - time decay of the density ( starting from a state with @xmath38 ) is dominated by the rare regions while the bulk contribution decays exponentially . according to finite size scaling @xcite",
    ", the behavior of the correlation time @xmath39 of a single rare region of size @xmath18 in the vicinity of the clean bulk critical point can be modelled by @xmath40 here @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the @xmath3-dimensional bulk dynamical critical exponent , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the correlation length and dynamical exponents of a @xmath21-dimensional system . to exponential accuracy",
    ", the time dependence of the total density is given by @xmath45\\label{eq : sp_int}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is a constant .",
    "let us first consider the time evolution at the clean critical point @xmath8 . for @xmath47 , the correlation time ( [ eq : xit ] ) simplifies to @xmath48 . using the saddle point method to evaluate the integral ( [ eq : sp_int ] )",
    ", we find the leading long - time decay of the density to be given by a stretched exponential , @xmath49    for @xmath50 , i.e , in the absorbing phase , the correlation time of the largest islands does not diverge but is cut - off by the distance from the clean critical point , @xmath51 .",
    "the large islands with this correlation time dominate the variational integral ( [ eq : sp_int ] ) .",
    "this leads to a simple exponential decay with a decay constant @xmath52    the most interesting case is @xmath53 , i.e. , the tail region of the smeared transition . here",
    ", we repeat the saddle point analysis with the full expression ( [ eq : xit ] ) for the correlation time . for intermediate times @xmath54 the decay of the average density is still given by the stretched exponential ( [ eq : stretched ] ) . for times larger than the crossover time",
    "@xmath55 the system realizes that some of the rare regions are in the active phase and contribute to a finite steady state density .",
    "the approach of the average density to this steady state value is characterized by a power - law . @xmath56",
    "the value of @xmath57 can not be found by our methods since it depends on the neglected nonuniversal pre - exponential factors .",
    "we now illustrate the smearing of the phase transition by extensive computer simulation results for a 2d contact process with linear defects ( @xmath58 ) . there is a number of different ways to actually implement the contact process on the computer ( all equivalent with respect to the universal behavior ) .",
    "we follow the widely used algorithm described , e.g. , by dickman @xcite .",
    "runs start at time @xmath59 from some configuration of occupied and empty sites .",
    "each event consists of randomly selecting an occupied site @xmath60 from a list of all @xmath61 occupied sites , selecting a process : creation with probability @xmath62 $ ] or annihilation with probability @xmath63 $ ] and , for creation , selecting one of the neighboring sites of @xmath60 .",
    "the creation succeeds , if this neighbor is empty .",
    "the time increment associated with this event is @xmath64 .    using this algorithm ,",
    "we have performed simulations for linear system sizes up to @xmath65 and impurity concentrations @xmath66 and 0.4 .",
    "the relative strength of the birth rate on the impurities was @xmath67 for all simulations .",
    "the data presented below represent averages of @xmath68 disorder realizations . because of the large system sizes and the high number of realizations , the statistical errors are very low .",
    "the _ relative _ statistical error of the average density ranges from @xmath69 at high densities to @xmath70 for @xmath71 and to @xmath72 for the lowest shown densities @xmath73 . except at these lowest densities ,",
    "the error is smaller than or comparable with the line width in the figures .",
    "we have chosen the above parameters , viz .",
    ", a low concentration of impurities which have a birth rate much smaller than the bulk , because these conditions are favorable for observing the smeared transition in a finite size simulation .",
    "if @xmath15 was too large , the exponential drop - offs in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rho ] ) and ( [ eq : stretched ] ) would be very steep and hard to observe over a significant range of @xmath7 or @xmath74 , respectively . if @xmath16 was too close to one , clean critical fluctuations would mask the tail of the smeared transition .      in this subsection ,",
    "we discuss the time evolution of the density starting from a completely occupied lattice , @xmath75 .",

    "in contrast , in the dirty system , the density increases much more slowly with @xmath7 after crossing the clean critical point .",
    "this suggests either a critical point with a very large exponent @xmath94 or exponential behavior .",
    "let us now investigate the behavior of the dirty system in the low - density tail more closely . in figure",

    "the dependence is close to linear , as predicted below eq .",
    "( [ eq : w_lam ] ) ( slight deviations from the theoretical prediction can again be attributed to the pre - exponential terms neglected in the extremal statistics theory . )",
    "to summarize , we have provided extensive numerical evidence that extended impurities destroy the sharp nonequilibrium phase transition in the contact process by smearing and lead to a ( nonuniversal ) exponential dependence of the density and other quantities on the control parameter .",
    "these results are in agreement with the predictions of ref.@xcite which were based on extremal statistics arguments and mean - field theory . in this section ,",
    "we first relate our findings to a power - counting analysis of the corresponding field theory .",
    "we then compare our smeared phase transition to the more conventional griffiths effects in the contact process with point - like defects@xcite , and we discuss general implications for theory and experiment .    the field - theoretic formulation of the contact process @xcite is the so - called reggeon field theory which was originally studied in the context of hadronic interactions at ultra - relativistic energies ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in appropriate units , its action reads @xmath100\\phi\\ ] ] where @xmath101 represents the density while @xmath102 is the martin - siggia - rosen response field and @xmath103 denotes the bare distance from the transition . a simple power counting analysis for the scale dimension of @xmath104 at the gaussian fixed point yields @xmath105=4-d$ ] , i.e. , the upper critical dimension of this field theory is @xmath106 .",
    "spatially quenched disorder ( both uncorrelated or correlated ) can be taken into account by adding a term @xmath107 ^ 2\\ ] ] where the outer integral is over the uncorrelated directions @xmath108 while the inner spatial integrals are over the correlated directions @xmath109 ( see @xcite for the uncorrelated case @xmath110 ) .",
    "power counting for the scale dimension of @xmath111 gives @xmath112 = 4-d+d_{cor}$ ] .",
    "uncorrelated disorder is marginal at @xmath113 , but disorder correlations increase the scale dimension of @xmath111 making the disorder term renormalization - group relevant .",
    "the power - counting analysis thus predicts stronger effects for correlated disorder than for point - like disorder , in agreement with our results .",
    "let us emphasize however , that the smeared phase transition scenario found in the present manuscript can not be obtained in a perturbative analysis of the reggeon field theory because the rare regions are non - perturbative degrees of freedom .",
    "both conventional griffiths effects and the smearing scenario found in the present paper are caused by rare large spatial regions which are locally in the active phase even if the bulk system is not .",
    "the difference between griffiths effects and the smearing of the transition is the result of disorder correlations . for point - like defects , i.e. , uncorrelated disorder ,",
    "the rare regions are of finite size and can not undergo a true phase transition .",
    "instead , they fluctuate slowly which gives rise to griffiths effects . in contrast , if the rare regions are infinite in at least one dimension , a stronger effect occurs : each rare region can independently undergo the phase transition and develop a nonzero steady state density .",
    "this leads to a smearing of the global transition .",
    "the smearing mechanism found here relies only on the existence of a true phase transition on an isolated rare region .",
    "it should therefore apply not only to the directed percolation universality class , but to an entire family of nonequilibrium universality classes for spreading processes and reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "note that while the presence or absence of smearing is universal in the sense of critical phenomena ( it depends on symmetries and dimensionality only ) , the functional form of the density and other observables is _ not _ universal , it depends on the details of the disorder distribution @xcite .",
    "smearing phenomena similar to the one found here can also occur at equilibrium phase transitions . at quantum phase transitions in itinerant electron systems ,",
    "even point - like impurities can lead to smearing @xcite ( the necessary disorder correlations are in imaginary time direction ) .",
    "in contrast , for the classical ising ( heisenberg ) universality class , the impurities have to be at least 2d ( 3d ) for the transition to be smeared which makes the phenomenon less likely to be observed @xcite .    in the context of our findings",
    "it is worth noting that , despite its ubiquity in theory and simulations , clearcut experimental realizations of the directed percolation universality class are strangely lacking @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", the only verification so far has been found in the spatio - temporal intermittency in ferrofluidic spikes @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the disorder - induced smearing found in the present paper may explain the striking absence of directed percolation scaling @xcite in at least some of the experiments .",
