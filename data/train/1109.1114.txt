    "asteroids are a fundamental source of information about the evolution of the planetary system",
    ". some of the resonant groups , i.e. , located in the major mean - motion resonances with jupiter , might also have been influenced by planetary migration , because their current distribution does not match the map of the currently stable regions .",
    "for instance , there are two stable islands denoted a and b in the j2/1 resonance and only the b  island is populated ( nesvorn & ferraz - mello 1997 ) .    in this work we focus on the hilda asteroid family in the 3/2 resonance with jupiter .",
    "we exploit our ability to model long - term evolution of asteroid families , which is usually dominated by the yarkovsky effect on the orbital elements ( bottke et al .",
    "2001 ) , often coupled to the yorp effect on the spin rate and obliquity ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    "chaotic diffusion in eccentricity and sometimes interactions with weak mean - motion or secular resonances ( vokrouhlick et al .",
    "2006a ) also play important roles . in case of asteroids inside strong mean - motion resonances",
    ", one has to account for the `` resonant '' _ yarkovsky effect _ , which causes a systematic drift in eccentricity ( bro & vokrouhlick 2008 ) .",
    "this is different from usual non - resonant orbits where the yarkovsky effect causes a drift in semimajor axis .",
    "the hilda collisional family  a part of the so called hilda group in the 3/2 mean motion resonance with jupiter  was already briefly discussed by bro & vokrouhlick ( 2008 ) . however , the modelling presented in that paper was not very successful , since the resulting age of the family seemed to be too large ( exceeding @xmath5 ) .",
    "this was an important motivation for our current work .",
    "we think that we missed an important mechanism in our previous model , namely perturbations arising from the migration of the giant planets and also an appropriate treatment of the yorp effect .",
    "indeed , the age @xmath6 suggests that the planetary migration might have played a _",
    "role during the early evolution of the hilda family . in this paper",
    "we thoroughly test this hypothesis .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : at first , we study the observed properties of the j3/2 resonance population in section  [ sec : population ] . our dynamical model of the hilda family ( without migration first )",
    "is described in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "then we estimate the collisional activity in the j3/2 region in section  [ sec : collisions ] .",
    "the results of our simulations of the giant - planet migration are presented in section  [ sec : migration ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "asteroids located in the 3/2 mean motion resonance with jupiter have osculating semimajor axes around @xmath7 , i.e. beyond the main asteroid belt .",
    "contrary to the kirkwood gaps ( associated with j3/1 , j7/3 or j2/1 resonances ) , this resonance is populated by asteroids while its neighbourhood is almost empty .",
    "the hilda collisional family we are going to discuss in detail is a small part of the whole j3/2 resonant population .",
    "our identification procedure of the j3/2 resonant population was described in the previous paper bro & vokrouhlick  ( 2008 ) . using the astorb catalogue of orbits (",
    "version @xmath8 , oct 31st 2010 ) we identified 1787 numbered and multi - opposition bodies with librating critical argument @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the mean longitude of jupiter , @xmath13 the mean longitude of the asteroid and @xmath14 the longitude of perihelion of the asteroid .    in order to study the detailed distribution of the bodies librating inside the resonance we have to use pseudo - proper resonant elements defined as approximate surfaces of sections ( roig et al .",
    "2002 ) , i.e. intersection of the trajectory with a plane defined by : @xmath15 over several oscillations and the minimum of the eccentricity  @xmath16 or the inclination  @xmath17 .",
    "we need to apply a digital filter to @xmath18 prior to using eq .",
    "( [ sigma_cond ] ) , namely filter  a from quinn , tremaine & duncan ( 1991 ) , with sampling 1yr and decimation factor of 10 , to suppress fast @xmath19 oscillations , which would otherwise disturb slower @xmath20 oscillations associated with resonant librations .",
    "finally , we apply an averaging of the sections @xmath21 over 1myr running window and these averages are the pseudo - proper elements @xmath22 .",
    "the accuracy of the pseudo - proper elements is of the order @xmath23 for @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 or @xmath27 which is much smaller than the structures we are interested in .",
    "the overall dynamical structure of the j3/2 resonance is determined by secular resonances @xmath28 , @xmath29 at high eccentricities @xmath30 and secondary resonances at lower values of @xmath31 ( according to morbidelli & moons 1993 , nesvorn & ferraz - mello 1997 , ferraz - mello et al .",

    "they destabilise the orbits at the borders of a stable island .",
    "the orbits inside the island exhibit very low chaotic diffusion rates , so bodies can remain there for 4gyr ( without non - gravitational perturbation ) .",
    "next we apply a hierarchical clustering method ( zappal et al . 1994 ) to detect significant clusters .",
    "we use a standard metric in the pseudo - proper element space @xmath32 @xmath33 in the following , we do not discuss the known schubart family , which was sufficiently analysed elsewhere ( bro & vokrouhlick 2008 ) , but we focus on the family associated with ( 153 )  hilda . a suitable cut  off velocity for the hilda family seems to be @xmath34 , because the number of members does not change substantially around this value ( see figure  [ nv ] ) . the number of members at this cut ",
    "off is  400 .     of the hilda family members versus the selected cut  off velocity @xmath35.,width=302 ]    the resulting plots @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 of the hilda family",
    "show very interesting features ( see figure  [ hilda_ahehih ] ) .",
    "the distribution of semimajor axis and inclination seems rather uniform and almost independent of absolute magnitude  @xmath39 , but eccentricities of small asteroids ( i.e. , with high  @xmath39 ) are clearly concentrated at the outskirts of the family and depleted in the centre .    in order to explain the distribution of asteroids in the @xmath40 plane we have to recall that asteroids orbiting about the sun are affected by non - gravitational forces , mostly by the yarkovsky / yorp effect , i.e. the recoil force / torque due to anisotropic emission of thermal radiation .",
    "we consider the concentrations in the @xmath40 plane to be a strong indication of the ongoing yarkovsky / yorp evolution , because they are very similar to those observed among several main - belt families in the @xmath41 plane and successfully modelled by vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2006b ) .",
    "the difference between these two cases stems from the fact that main - belt families are non - resonant and the yarkovsky / yorp effect thus increases or decreases the semimajor axis ( depending on the actual obliquity of the spin axis ) , while in our resonant case , the same perturbation results instead in a systematic increase or decrease of eccentricity .",
    "a detailed modelling of the @xmath16-distribution is postponed to section  [ sec : results_yarko ] .",
    "the central part of the @xmath40 distribution , from @xmath42 to 0.23 , seems rather extended .",
    "the large asteroids ( @xmath43 ) are spread over this interval of eccentricities even though their yarkovsky drift rates must have been small .",
    "only 24 of them are likely to be interlopers , because there is a very low number of background asteroids in the surroundings of the family ( see figure  [ r32_even2_ai_4000myr ] ) .",
    "we think this shape might actually be the result of the initial size - independent perturbation that the family distribution received by the migration of the giant planets ( which we discuss in section  [ sec : results_mig ] ) .    regarding the @xmath41 distribution ,",
    "the largest asteroid ( 153 ) hilda is offset with respect to the centre , but this is a natural outcome of the definition of the pseudo - proper elements  fragments which fall to the left of the libration centre are mapped to the right which creates the offset .",
    "the geometric albedos for hilda family objects are poorly known .",
    "there are only six measured values for the family members : 0.064 , 0.046 , 0.038 , 0.089 , 0.044 , 0.051 ( davis & neese 2002 ) .",
    "given the low number of values and the possibility of selection effects we prefer to assume the family members have a mean value @xmath44 , which corresponds to the whole j3/2 population .",
    "the size of the parent body can be then estimated to be @xmath45 .",
    "we employ two independent methods to determine the diameter @xmath46 : ( i )  we sum the volumes of the observed bodies larger than an assumed completeness limit @xmath47 and then we prolong the slope of the size - frequency distribution down to @xmath48 to account for unobservable bodies ( see bro & vokrouhlick 2008 ) , which results in @xmath49 ; ( ii )  we also use a geometric method developed by tanga et al .",
    "( 1998 ) which gives @xmath50 .",
    "a test with different albedo values will be described in section  [ sec : high_albedo ] .",
    "the size - frequency distribution @xmath51 vs @xmath52 of the hilda family is steeper than that of background j3/2 population , but shallower than for usual main - belt families ( figure  [ r32-size_distribution_hilda_inc3 ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the slope @xmath53 of the distribution @xmath54 is close to a collisional equilibrium calculated by dohnanyi ( 1969 ) .",
    "colour data extracted from the sloan digital sky survey moving object catalogue version  4 ( parker et al .",
    "2008 ) confirm the hilda family belongs to the taxonomic type  c , because most of the spectral slopes are small .",

    "a very prominent schubart cluster ( studied by bro & vokrouhlick 2008 ) is visible around @xmath55 .",

    "several main - belt families are plotted for comparison : eos ( with slope @xmath57 ) , eunomia ( @xmath58 ) , hygiea ( @xmath59 ) , koronis ( @xmath60 ) , themis ( @xmath61 ) , tirela ( @xmath62 ) , veritas ( @xmath63 ) and vesta ( @xmath64).,width=219 ]",
    "to understand the long term evolution of the hilda family , we construct a detailed numerical model , extending efforts in bro & vokrouhlick ( 2008 ) , which includes the following processes : ( i )  impact disruption , ( ii )  the yarkovsky effect , ( iii )  the yorp effect , ( iv )  collisions and spin - axis reorientations .",
    "we describe the individual parts of the model in the forthcoming subsections .      to obtain initial conditions for the family just after the breakup event we need a model for the ejection velocities of the fragments .",
    "we use a very simple model of an isotropic ejection from the work of farinella et al .",
    "the distribution of velocities `` at infinity '' follows the function @xmath65 with the exponent @xmath66 being a  free parameter , @xmath67 a normalisation constant and @xmath68 the escape velocity from the parent body , which is determined by its size  @xmath46 and mean density  @xmath69 as @xmath70 the distribution is usually cut at a selected maximum allowed velocity @xmath71 to prevent outliers .",
    "the actual values of all these parameters are given in section  [ sec : results_yarko ] .",
    "typically , the overall distribution of velocities has a peak close to the escape velocity , which is approximately 100 m/s for a 200 km parent body .",
    "the initial velocities @xmath72 of individual bodies are generated by a straightforward monte  carlo code and the orientations of the velocity vectors @xmath73 in space are assigned randomly .    here , we assume the velocity of fragments is independent of their size , which seems reasonable with respect to the observed uniform distribution of the hilda family in the @xmath41 and @xmath74 planes ( figure  [ hilda_ahehih ] ) .",
    "we perform also tests with non - isotropic distributions in section  [ sec : asymmetric ] .",
    "we must also select initial osculating eccentricity  @xmath75 of the parent body , initial inclination  @xmath76 , as well as true anomaly  @xmath77 and argument of perihelion  @xmath78 at the time of impact disruption .",
    "all of these parameters determine the initial shape of the synthetic `` hilda '' family just after the disruption of the parent body .",
    "initial semimajor axis  @xmath79 is not totally free , instead it is calculated from the initial semimajor axis of jupiter  @xmath80 and the kepler law , since the parent body has to be confined in the j3/2 resonance .",
    "the long - term evolution of asteroid orbits is mainly driven by the yarkovsky thermal effect .",
    "the implementation of the yarkovsky effect in the swift integrator was described in detail in bro ( 2006 ) .",
    "only minor modifications of the code were necessary to incorporate spin rate evolution , which is driven by the yorp effect ( see section  [ sec : yorp ] ) .",
    "the thermal parameter we use are reasonable estimates for c / x - type bodies : @xmath81 for the surface and bulk densities , @xmath82 for the surface thermal conductivity , @xmath83 for the heat capacity , @xmath84 for the bond albedo and @xmath85 for the thermal emissivity parameter .",
    "we can use a standard algorithm for the calculation of the yarkovsky acceleration which results in a semimajor - axis drift in case of non - resonant bodies .",
    "the drift in eccentricity in case of resonant bodies arises `` automatically '' due to the gravitational part of the integrator . in figure  [ hilda_deltae ] we can see a comparison between the expected drift  @xmath86 in semimajor axis and the resulting drift  @xmath87 in eccentricity , computed for the hilda family ( see the explanation in appendix a of bro & vokrouhlick 2008 ) .",
    "the data can be approximated by a linear relationship , where the departures from linearity are caused mainly by interactions of drifting orbits with embedded weak secular or secondary resonances .",
    "note that according to a standard solar model the young sun was faint ( gdel 2007 ) , i.e. , its luminosity 4gyr ago was 75% of the current  @xmath88 .",
    "we can then expect a lower insolation and consequently weaker thermal effects acting on asteroids . since we assume a constant value of  @xmath88 in our code the age estimated for the hilda family ( in section  [ sec : results_yarko ] )",
    "can be 12.5% larger .     in semimajor axis and the simulated drift @xmath87 in eccentricity , computed for 360 members of the hilda family located inside the j3/2 resonance.,width=264 ]",
    "the magnitude of the yarkovsky drift sensitively depends on the orientation of the spin axis with respect to the orbital plane and , to a lesser extent , on the angular velocity too .",
    "we thus have to account for the long - term evolution of spins of asteroids which is controlled by torques arising from the emission of thermal radiation , i.e. the yorp effect .",
    "the implementation of the yorp effect follows vokrouhlick et al .",
    "we assume the following relations for the rate of angular velocity and obliquity @xmath89 where @xmath90- and @xmath91-functions are given by apek & vokrouhlick ( 2004 ) for a set of 200 shapes with mean radius @xmath92 , bulk density @xmath93 , located on a circular orbit with semimajor axis @xmath94 .",
    "the shapes of the hilda family members are not known , so we assign one of the artificial shapes ( denoted by the index  @xmath95 ) randomly to each individual asteroid .",
    "we only have to scale the @xmath90- and @xmath91-functions by a factor @xmath96 where @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 are semimajor axis , radius and density of the simulated body , and @xmath100 is a free scaling parameter , which can account for an additional uncertainty of the yorp model .",
    "because the values of @xmath90 s and @xmath91 s were computed for only a limited set of obliquities ( with a  step @xmath101 ) we use interpolation by hermite polynomials ( hill 1982 ) of the data in apek & vokrouhlick ( 2004 ) to obtain a smooth analytical functions for @xmath102 and @xmath103 .    if the angular velocity approaches a critical value @xmath104 we assume a mass shedding event , so we keep the orientation of the spin axis and the sense of rotation , but we reset the orbital period  @xmath105 to a random value from the interval @xmath106  hours .",
    "we also change the assigned shape to a different one , since any change of shape may result in a different yorp effect .",
    "the differential equations  ( [ eq : domega ] ) , ( [ eq : depsil ] ) are integrated numerically by a simple euler integrator .",

    "essentially , there are only three situations , when the hilda family is strongly perturbed , otherwise the spread in @xmath16 does not change much in course of time .    a very simple test , which allows us to quickly select allowed migration scenarios , is the number of remaining `` hilda '' family members",
    ". we may assume the depletion by dynamical effects was probably low ( say 50% at most ) , otherwise we would obtain much larger parent body than @xmath172 , which has much lower probability of collisional disruption .",
    "the fractions of the remaining bodies @xmath173 versus initial conditions for planets are displayed in figure  [ r32-mig_grid_nleft_a_j_a_s_tau ]",
    ".    low number of remaining bodies @xmath174 indicates that perturbations acting on the synthetic family were too strong .",
    "it means either the family had to be formed later ( when fewer and weaker secondary resonances are encountered ) to match the observed family or this migration scenario is not allowed .",
    "the same applies to the dispersion of @xmath16-distribution ( see below ) : if it is too large compared to the observed hilda family , the synthetic `` hilda '' had to be formed later or the scenario is not allowed .",
    "our results indicate that :    1 .",
    "a faster migration time scale @xmath175 to @xmath176 is preferred over slower time scales ; 2 .",
    "jupiter and saturn were not in the most compact configuration ( @xmath177 , @xmath178 ) at the time when the `` hilda '' family was created .",
    "another important test was devoted to the impact parameters , which were varied in a relatively large steps : @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 .",
    "note that the selection of impact parameters is rather extreme , so that we do not expect they may ever be out of these bounds .",
    "the total number of simulations is  384 .",
    "the migration parameters were fixed ( they correspond to one successful migration scenario ) : @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 .",
    "this time , we decided to use a simple quantity to discuss the results , namely the eccentricity dispersion @xmath192 of the synthetic family at the end of the giant - planet migration .",
    "the most frequent values of the dispersion are @xmath193 ( see the histograms in figure  [ r32-mig_grid_impact_ntp360_sigma_histograms_after_migration_all ] ) .",
    "further evolution by the yarkovsky / yorp effect would increase the dispersions up to @xmath194 , while the observed dispersion of the hilda family is @xmath195 .",
    "we see the histograms look similar for _ all _ the impact parameters , there is even no apparent correlation between them .",
    "the explanation for this ` lack of dependence ' is that the eccentricity distribution is mainly determined by the perturbations of the giant planets .",
    "a given planetary evolution therefore gives a characteristic value of @xmath192 whatever the impact parameters are .",
    "the dispersion in @xmath192 values is due to the fact that the planetary evolutions that we computed change widely from one simulation to another .",
    "though planet migration was prescribed analytically , there are mutual interactions of planets and random captures in resonances ( or jumps across resonances ) which may affect the eccentricity distribution of the synthetic `` hilda '' family .",
    "an extreme case is shown in figure  [ r32-mig_grid_impact_ntp360_00000354_at ] . in this particular simulation , jupiter and saturn",
    "were captured in the mutual 3:7 resonance for 0.5myr which resulted in a large eccentricity dispersion @xmath196 of the synthetic family .",
    "our conclusion is that the impact parameters are less important than the parameters related to migration .",
    "even though we do not perform a joint integration which includes both the planetary migration and yarkovsky / yorp effect , we try to match the previous results from sections  [ sec : results_mig ] and  [ sec : results_yarko ] together .",
    "we do it by using a straightforward monte ",
    "carlo approach : ( i )  we take the pseudo - proper eccentricities @xmath197 of bodies at the end of planetary migration from section  [ sec : results_mig ] ; ( ii )  we compute total yarkovsky / yorp drifts  @xmath198 in eccentricity from section  [ sec : results_yarko ] ; ( iii )  we assign every body a drift randomly ( @xmath199 ) and this way we construct an evolved synthetic family .",
    "finally , we compare the synthetic family to the observed hilda family by computing a kolmogorov - smirnov test for @xmath200 and @xmath201 distributions .    to avoid problems with low number of bodies ( 60 in case of planetary migration ) , we perform the above procedure 100 times , always with a different random seed for the assignment of the @xmath198 . we then take a median of the 100  ks  statistics as a result for one particular run .",
    "the resulting histograms of the median @xmath202 for various initial conditions are shown in figure  [ r32-mig_grid_d_ks_r32-impye3_yorp_cyorp_0.33_a_j_a_s_tau ] .",
    "we confirm the conclusions from section  [ sec : results_mig ]  those migration scenarios that preserve the largest number of family members ( i.e. , high @xmath174 ) are the same , for which we can find a good fit of eccentricity distribution ( low @xmath202 ) .",
    "moreover , it seems we can exclude also the timescale of migration @xmath167 since the total number of successful simulations is significantly smaller in this case .",
    "results of this paper can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the hilda family evolves mainly due to the yarkovsky / yorp effect and the observed large spread of eccentricities indicates the age @xmath203 .",
    "2 .   the collisional disruption of a @xmath172 parent body is unlikely in the current environment .",
    "instead , it rather occurred during the late heavy bombardment when collisions with comets dominated and were up to 50  times more frequent .",
    "another possible source of projectiles is the population of d - type asteroids captured in the j3/2 resonance ( levison et al .",
    "3 .   in case",
    "the hilda family was created during giant - planet migration , which seems to us likely , the major perturbations of the family were due to secondary resonances between libration frequency and the frequency of jupiter ",
    "saturn 1:2 critical argument .",
    "4 .   on the basis of our simulations",
    ", we argue the migration was relatively fast ( with time scale @xmath175 to @xmath2 ) and jupiter and saturn were relatively closer to the current configuration ( with period ratio @xmath204 or more ) at the moment when the `` hilda '' family was created , otherwise the family would be ` destroyed ' by migration .",
    "slower migration time scales are only allowed for larger values of @xmath158 ratios .",
    "the hilda family thus proved to be one of the oldest families in the main asteroid belt .",
    "there are emerging indications that orbital evolution of planets was rather violent and close encounters between planets were present ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2007 , brasser et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this might be still consistent with our model of the hilda family , but of course we have to assume the family formed after severe perturbations in the j3/2 region ended . a more complicated migration scenario like that of ` jumping jupiter ' ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2010 ) even seems favourable in our case because jupiter and saturn very quickly reach a high period ratio ( @xmath205 , i.e. the planets are quite close to their current orbits ) .",
    "then , the perturbations acting on the j3/2 region are already small and the flux of impactors becomes high just _ after _ the jump . the hilda family thus might have formed exactly during this brief period of time .    regarding future improvements of our model , knowledge of geometric albedos for a large number of small asteroids may significantly help and decrease uncertainties .",
    "the wise infrared mission seems to be capable to obtain this data in near future .",
