    "long duration gamma - ray bursts are generally believed to result from the death of massive stars , and their association with core - collapse supernovae ( sne of type ib / c ) has been observed over the last decade .",
    "the first hint for such a connection came with the discovery of a nearby sn 1998bw in the error circle of grb 980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ; iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) at distance of only about @xmath5 .",

    "1998 ) and the radio afterglow modelling suggests an energy of @xmath7 in a mildly relativistic ejecta ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) . recently",
    "_ swift _ discovered grb 060218 , which is the second nearest grb identified so far ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ; cusumano et al . 2006 ; mirabal & halpern 2006 ; sakamoto 2006 ) .",
    "it is also an under - energetic burst with energy in prompt @xmath8/x - rays about @xmath9 and is associated with sn 2006aj .",
    "another burst , grb 031203 , is a third example of this group ( sazonov et al .",
    "2004 ) .",

    "( 2004 ) , no such burst with redshifts @xmath10 should be observed by a hete - like instrument within the next 20 years .",
    "therefore , the unexpected discovery of grb 060218 may suggest that these objects form a different new class of grbs from the conventional high - luminosity grbs ( soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ; pian et al . 2006 ; cobb et al . 2006",
    "; liang et al . 2006 ; guetta & della valle 2007 ; dai 2008 ) , although what distinguishes such low - luminosity grbs ( ll - grbs ) from the conventional high - luminosity grbs ( hl - grbs ) remains unknown .",
    "their rate of occurrence may be one order of magnitude higher than that of the typical ones ( e.g. soderberg et al .",
    "they are rarely recorded because such intrinsically dim grbs can only be detected from relatively short distances with present gamma - ray instruments .",
    "the `` compactness problem '' of grbs requires that the outflow of normal grbs should be highly relativistic with a bulk lorentz factor of @xmath11 ( baring & harding 1997 ; lithwick & sari 2001 ) . the low - luminosity and softer spectra of low - luminosity grbs",
    "relax this constraint on the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "it was suggested that the softer spectrum and low energetics of grb060218 ( or classified as x - ray flash 060218 ) may indicate a somewhat lower lorentz factor of the order of @xmath12 ( e.g. mazzali 2006 ; fan et al .",
    "2006 ; toma et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility is that low - luminosity grbs are driven by a trans - relativistic outflow with @xmath13 ( waxman 2004 ; waxman , mszros & campana , 2007 ; wang , li , waxman & mszros 2007 ; ando & mszros 2008 ) . the flat light curve of the x - ray afterglow of the nearest grb , grb 980425/sn 1998bw , up to 100 days after the burst , has been argued to result from the coasting phase of a mildly relativistic shell with an energy of a few times @xmath14 erg ( waxman 2004 ) . from the thermal energy density in the prompt emission of grb060218/sn2006aj , campana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) inferred that the shell driving the radiation - dominated shock in grb 060218/sn 2006aj must be mildly relativistic .",
    "this trans - relativistic shock could be driven by the outermost parts of the envelope that get accelerated to a mildly relativistic velocity when the supernova shock accelerates in the density gradient of the envelope of the supernova progenitor ( colgate 1974 ; matzner & mckee 1999 ; tan et al .",

    "note that in the conventional relativistic ejecta model , even if @xmath18 the dynamics of the blast wave is identical to the case of @xmath19 from the time tens of seconds after the burst , because the blast wave has entered the blandford - mckee self - similar phase since then .    we consider a spherical grb ejecta carrying a total energy of @xmath20 expanding into a surrounding wind medium with density profile @xmath21 , where @xmath22 with @xmath23 . as the circumburst medium is swept up by the blast wave ,",

    "the accelerated electrons can be cooled by synchrotron radiation and inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of seed photons ( including synchrotron photons and blackbody photons emitted by the supernova ) .",
    "since the ic emissivity on the basis of the thomson cross section is inaccurate for high - energy @xmath8-rays , we use the full klein - nishina cross section instead .",
    "once the electron distribution and the flux of seed photons ( @xmath63 ) ( the distribution of which is isotropic ) are known , the ic emissivity ( at frequency @xmath64 ) of electrons can be calculated by(blumenthal @xmath52 gould 1970 ; yu et al .",

    "these soft photons from supernova impinge on the shock region basically along the radial direction in the rest frame of the shock , so the scatterings between these photons and the isotropically - distributed electrons in the shock are anisotropic . for a photon beam penetrating into the shock region where the electrons are moving isotropically , the inverse compton scattering emissivity of the radiation scattered at an angle @xmath71 relative to the direction of the photon beam in the shock comoving frame is ( aharonian @xmath52 atoyan 1981 , brunetti 2000 , fan et .",

    "note that @xmath85 in eq.(15 ) can be transformed to @xmath86 through @xmath87 .",
    "for seed photons from the supernova , we consider the contributions from two components .",
    "one is the early thermal uv - optical emission from the cooling supernova envelope after being heated by the radiation - dominated shock ( waxman et al .",
    "2007 ; chevalier @xmath52 fransson 2008 ) .",
    "such uv - optical emission has been observed recently by _ swift _ uvot from sn2006aj ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ) and sn2008d ( soderberg et al . 2008 ) .",
    "another component is the supernova optical emission at later time , powered by the radioactive elements synthesized in supernovae .",
    "the characterization of the emission from the cooling supernova envelope is expressed as follows , which is correct at @xmath88 ( waxman , mszros , @xmath52 campana 2007 ) : @xmath89 @xmath90 @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the radius and temperature of the envelope , @xmath94 is the luminosity from the photosphere of the cooling envelope , @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the supernova ejecta mass and energy , and @xmath97 is the initial stellar radius of the sn progenitor .",
    "we take the following values for supernovae like sn2006aj and sn2008d : @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( mazzali et al .",
    "2006 ; soderberg et al .",

    "gives a larger kinetic energy and ejecta mass such as @xmath101 and @xmath102 for sn1998bw ( woosley et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the late component is rising before @xmath103 and then decaying exponentially .",
    "for sn2008d , it is found that the rising is roughly in proportion to @xmath104 ( soderberg et .",
    "al . 2008 ) , so we can describe the luminosity as @xmath105 we assumed that the radiation temperature is approximately constant , @xmath106 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the cooling supernova envelop is dominant over that of the late component before @xmath107 .    through the calculation of the shock dynamic evolution ,",
    "the radii of the grb shock are @xmath108 @xmath109 at @xmath110 , and @xmath111 at @xmath112 for the trans - relativistic ejecta model , and for the conventional ejecta model @xmath113 at @xmath114 and @xmath115 at @xmath112 . according to eq.[rph ] ,",

    "consequently the shell radius is less than ten percents of the grb ejecta height , so it is reasonable to approximate that supernova photons come from a point source at the center and impinge onto the electrons in the shock from behind .",

    ", we estimate the cutoff energy conservatively by assuming that colliding photons are moving isotropically in the shock frame .",
    "such a treatment may overestimate the pair - production opacity because in reality the supernova seed photons move anisotropically ( i.e. moving outward in radial direction as seen by high - energy photons emitted from the shock at much larger radii ) .    the result of the cutoff energy in the observer frame @xmath150 is given in figure [ nucut ] . since the luminosity and peak energy of the supernova envelope emission decreases with time in general and the shock radius increases with time , the cutoff energy of the high energy spectrum increases with time , which is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ nucut ] . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the cutoff energy is above @xmath151 after the starting time of our calculation ( @xmath152 ) , so we can calculate the light curves at energy @xmath153 without considering the opacity . since the cutoff energy is large enough , it does not affect the detectability of fermi lat , whose sensitive energy band is @xmath154 .",
    "we first compare the spectra of different ic components for the two models .",
    "the spectra at @xmath155 are shown in figure [ spectra_13 ] , including the synchrotron emission , the thermal emission from the supernova or hypernova , the synchrotron self - compton emission and the snic emission , for parameters @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 and burst distance @xmath160 . from the spectra",
    "we can see that for the supernova case the ssc emission dominates over the snic emission at energies from @xmath161 to @xmath162 for conventional relativistic ejecta model , and for trans - relativistic ejecta model the ssc emission is higher than snic emission and the two components are both important at high energies below the cutoff energy . for the hypernova case",
    "the ssc emission is dominant in the conventional relativistic ejecta model while the snic emission is dominant in the trans - relativistic ejecta model at the high energy band .",
    "this is because in the case of hypernovae and @xmath17 , the energy density of hupernova photons @xmath163 ( multiplied by the suppressed factor @xmath123 due to the anisotropic scattering ) is significantly higher than the synchrotron radiation density @xmath164 .",
    "figure [ lc_sup ] shows light curves of ssc and snic afterglow emission at @xmath165 in the two models for @xmath166 , @xmath158 and four different sets of parameters of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the supernova case . in the conventional relativistic model with @xmath16 ,",
    "a sharp decay phase of a gev afterglow is produced during the early hours , which is mildly dominated by the ssc emission , and a slightly flatter decay phase dominated by snic emission takes over at late times @xmath167 . on the other hand , for the trans - relativistic ejecta model with @xmath17 , a plateau of ssc emission , due to the presence of a coasting phase in the ejecta dynamic ,",

    "light curves in the conventional relativistic ejecta model are similar with those for the supernova case except that snic emission become dominant at earlier time ; for the trans - relativistic ejecta model , snic emission is always dominated with parameters @xmath156 and @xmath157 , a plateau is seen in the early time , which transits to a faster decay at later time .",
    "the two models also predict different flux levels at high - energies . in early hours ,",
    "the total flux from the conventional relativistic ejecta model is more than one order of magnitude higher than that in the trans - relativistic ejecta model .",
    "this can be explained by the different amount of energy in shocked electrons .",
    "for the conventional relativistic ejecta model , the ejecta has been decelerated at this time and a great part of its energy has been converted into shocked electrons , while in the trans - relativistic ejecta model , only a small fraction of the ejecta kinetic energy has been converted to shocked electrons at this early time . a lower amount of energy in shocked electrons results in a lower flux level in the trans - relativistic ejecta model .",
    "in addition , a comparison among four panels in figure [ lc_sup ] and figure [ lc_hyp ] indicates that the flux decreases as @xmath3 decreases , which is obvious since the energy of radiating electrons @xmath169 .",
    "as @xmath4 decreases , the ssc flux changes little and the snic flux increases for the case that ssc emission is dominant at early time .",
    "this can be understood from the following analysis . since the ssc emission dominates and @xmath170 at the early times , @xmath171 .",
    "the ssc and snic flux at @xmath172 scale as @xmath173 and @xmath174      the incoming supernova photons are anisotropic as seen by the isotropically distributed electrons in the grb shock , so the ic scatterings are anisotropic . in order to see how the anisotropic inverse - compton scattering ( aic ) affects the snic flux",
    ", we compare the light curves of the snic emission obtained by using the isotropic scattering formula eq.11 and using the aic scattering formula eq.13 in figure [ lc_iso ] .",
    "the thinner lines show the snic light curves obtained using the usual isotropic scattering formula , while the thicker ones correspond to the calculations with the aic scattering effect taken into account .",
    "one can see that the flux of the snic emission with the aic effect correction is reduced by a factor of about @xmath175 compared to the isotropic scattering case .",
    "this is consistent with the calculation result obtained by fan @xmath52 piran ( 2006 ) , who studied the anisotropic inverse compton scattering between inner optical / x - ray flare photons and electrons in the outer grb forward shock .",
    "fig.5 shows that the aic effect suppresses the snic flux only slightly .",
    "the anisotropic photon distribution results in more head - on scatterings , i.e. the photon beam scatter preferentially with those electrons that move in the direction antiparallel to the photon beam , so one can expect that the scattered ic emission power has a maximum at @xmath176 and goes to zero for small scattering angles ( e.g. brunetti 2000 ) .",
    "the photons scattered into the angles @xmath177 relative to the shock moving direction in the shock comoving frame will fall into the cone of angle @xmath178 in the observer frame , according to the transformation formula @xmath87 .",
    "therefore the aic scatterings decrease the ic emission in the @xmath178 cone along the direction of the photon beam , but meanwhile they enhance the emission at larger angles ( about half of the emission falling into angles between @xmath178 and @xmath179 , see wang & 2006 ) . for a spherical outflow as we consider here , the ic emission after integration over angles should have the same flux in every direction in the observer frame , with a flux level only slightly reduced comparable to the isotropic scattering case .      as a comparison",
    ", we derive here approximate analytical expressions for afterglow light curves , which provide an explanation for the physical origin of the behavior .",
    "since the anisotropic snic emission are depressed by a factor of @xmath180 , which is almost constant , relative to the isotropic seed photons case , we can consider the isotropic seed photons case for the approximate analytic treatment of the afterglow light curves .",
    "the blackbody photons from the supernova can be approximated as mono - energetic photons with @xmath181 .",
    "thus , similar to the description for synchrotron emission of a single electron ( sari et al .",
    "1998 ) , the radiation power and characteristic frequencies of snic from a single electron scattering supernova photons in the observer frame can be described by @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively .",
    "similar to the analysis in sari and esin ( 2001 ) , the maximum flux of the snic spectrum is @xmath184 characteristic snic frequencies are @xmath185 and @xmath186 respectively .    by adopting the broken power - law approximation for the ic spectral component ( sari & esin 2001 ) and the dynamics of the shock discussed in @xmath15 [ models ]",
    ", one can derive the analytic light curves in an approximate way .      in the conventional relativistic ejecta model , at time @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is defined as the transition time when @xmath189 , we have @xmath138 and @xmath190 , so @xmath191 .",
    "the shock dynamic follows the blandford & mckee self - similar solution in the wind medium , i.e. @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "then we can obtain the evolution of the break frequencies of the ssc and snic spectral components and their peak flux in the following way : @xmath194 @xmath195 and @xmath196 where @xmath197 has been used for the cooling envelope emission ( see eq . 13 ) . the ssc and snic flux at an observed frequency @xmath80 higher than characteristic frequencies vary as @xmath198 and @xmath199 respectively for @xmath200 .    at @xmath201 , where @xmath202 is the time when @xmath203",

    ", the shock is likely to enter the non - relativistic phase , so we take the sedov - von neumann - taylor solutions @xmath205 and @xmath206 , which induce that @xmath207 .",

    ", one would expect a much flatter light curve of high - energy gamma - ray emission at early times , which could be dominated by both the ssc emission and snic emission , depending on the properties of the underlying supernova and the shock parameter @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for the supernova case , the ssc emission is dominant before the deceleration time and the transition time for most parameters , while for the hypernova case , the ssc emission is dominant at earlier time with @xmath216 and @xmath217 and the snic emission is always dominant for @xmath156 and @xmath157 .    for cases where ssc emission dominated in trans - relativistic ejecta model",

    "the main difference between our calculation and that of ando & mszros ( 2008 ) is the different minimum lorentz factors used in the calculations .",

    "the external stellar wind provides a source of thomson opacity to scatter the supernova emission , thus a quasi - isotropic , back - scattered sn radiation field is present .",
    "let s study whether this component is important .",
    "for a grb shock locating at radius @xmath34 and moving with a lorentz factor @xmath8 , the thomson scattering optical depth of the wind is @xmath262 .",
    "the scattered sn energy density by the wind in the comoving frame of the blast wave is @xmath263 due to the relativistic boosting effect . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy density of the supernova photons impinging the shock from behind is @xmath264 ( see eq.21 ) .",
    "the ratio between these two energy densities is @xmath265 . for the trans - relativistic ejecta model with @xmath17 ,",
    "the radius of the grb ejecta is @xmath108 @xmath109 at @xmath110 , so @xmath266 for typical wind parameters .",
    "for the conventional relativistic ejecta model , the lorentz factor and radius of the grb ejecta are respectively @xmath267 and @xmath268 @xmath109 at @xmath110 , so we also have @xmath266 .",
    "this means that the wind - scattered supernova radiation field is subdominant compared to the direct impinging supernova photon field and hence we neglect its contribution to the high - energy gamma - ray emission .",
    "our estimate of the pair - production opacity for high - energy photons in @xmath15 [ tao ] is based on the common assumption that the colliding photons are isotropic in the rest frame .",
    "however , as we have shown above , the low - energy photons from the supernova essentially move radially outward before colliding with high - energy photons ( e.g. wang , li & 2006 ) .",
    "therefore , the collision process between the high - energy photons and soft supernova photons is anisotropic , which would decrease the pair - production opacity",
    ". this will be the subject of a more detailed future calculation and would be useful to explore whether @xmath269 photons can escape from the source , which is important for checking the detectability by ground - based cherenkov detectors such as magic , veritas , milago , hess , argo etc . additionally , besides the high - energy gamma - ray emission discussed in this work , the high - energy neutrino emission arising from @xmath270 interactions between shock - accelerated protons and photons from the supernova may also provide a constraint on the model for low - luminosity grbs ( e.g. yu et al . 2008 ) .",
    "trans - relativistic ejecta may also exist in the usual high luminosity long grbs , besides in low luminosity ones , since accelerating shocks are expected to accompany the supernova .",
    "berger et al . ( 2003 ) and sheth et al . (",
    "2003 ) found that the radio and optical afterglow indicates a low velocity component more than @xmath271 after the explosion in grb030329/sn2003dh .",
    "however , since the highly relativistic ejecta is much more energetic than the trans - relativistic component , high - energy gamma - ray emission from the latter component could easily remain hidden .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the spectra and light curves of the high - energy gamma - ray afterglow emission from low luminosity grbs for the two main models in the literature , i.e. the trans - relativistic ejecta model ( @xmath13 ) and the conventional highly relativistic ejecta model ( @xmath0 ) , considering both synchrotron self inverse - compton ( ssc ) and the external inverse - compton due to photons from the underlying supernova / hypernova .",
    "our analysis takes into account a full klein - nishina cross section for inverse compton scatterings , the anisotropic scattering of supernova photons and the opacity for high energy photons due to annihilation with low - energy photons ( mainly from the supernova / hypernova ) .",
    "we find that for the supernova case the conventional relativistic outflow model predicts a relatively high gamma - ray flux from ssc at early times ( @xmath272 for typical parameters ) with a rapidly decreasing flux , while in the trans - relativistic outflow model , a much flatter light curve of high - energy gamma - ray emission dominated by the ssc emission , is expected at early times .",
    "for the hypernova case , the ssc emission also dominates and decays sharply at early time in the conventional relativistic ejecta model , while for the trans - relativistic ejecta model , both the ssc emission and the snic emission could be dominant at early time , depending on the shock parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the main difference between these two models arises from their different initial lorentz factors , which induces a different dynamical evolution of the shock at early times . as a result ,",
    "different observational features arise , such as different light curve shapes , different flux levels and different dominant components ( as detailed in @xmath15 [ spectra and light curves ] ) . as shown in @xmath15 [ detectability of fermi lat ] , high - energy gamma - ray emission can be detected in both models as long as @xmath3 is large enough , although detection from the conventional relativistic ejecta is much easier . thus , with future high energy gamma - ray observations by fermi lat",
    ", one can expect to be able to distinguish between the two models based on the above differences in observational features .",
