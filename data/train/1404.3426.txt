    "@xcite we have shown , that for schwarzschild case , curved spacetime is equivalent to flat manifold minimally coupled to some scalar field .",
    "it was also confirmed in @xcite + this scalar field changes the metric of the stationary killing observer ( sko ) - the observer located in the constant position with distance r to the source of gravity .",

    "+ following @xcite we may now note light trajectory in sko s reference frame as @xmath40 what for coordinate angle @xmath31 from ( [ skoangle ] ) means @xmath41 above express exactly the same equation of light trajectory that we obtain from schwarzschild metric @xcite .",
    "thanks to ( [ epsil ] ) and ( [ angmom ] ) we will rewrite normalized lagrangian as : @xmath42 and using euler - lagrange equations after simply calculations we obtain radial acceleration in sko reference frame @xmath43 equal to @xmath44 and according to ( [ lag_red ] ) after renormalization we obtain the force acting on rest mass , equal to @xmath45 as we see , at @xmath46 centrifugal force vanishes what gives rise to black hole phenomena and defines photon sphere .",

    "this weakness of the metric is apparent , and we will explain the real meaning of this property in the next sections .",
    "+   + let us recall relation ( [ epsil ] ) , which is valid also in schwarzschild metric and transform to @xmath57 we see that @xmath30 indeed represents energy of the body in infinity what agrees with schwarzschild solution .",

    "this scalar field affects only sko s propertime , and should give metric tensor @xmath59 to explain how gravitational field changes above metric into ( [ metten ] ) , let us go through gravitational vector fields analyses .      on flat minkowski spacetime ,",
    "if we denote velocity of the body as @xmath60 and its time dilation factor as @xmath61 than from basic calculus rules we may express its material acceleration ( in respect to proper time ) by local velocity derivatives as @xmath62 now , let us notice , that @xmath63 therefore we may rewrite ( [ propv ] ) as @xmath64 we may therefore treat velocity and acceleration as some vector fields . let us take advantage of this property to consider gravity as field .",
    "+   + at first lest us introduce scalar @xmath65 equal to @xmath66 as we already know , this scalar field represents move of free - falling surroundings and - by analogy - illusory move of the sko against free - falling surroundings .",
    "+   + now , we define following vector fields @xmath67 for stationary observer ( sko ) , field @xmath68 does not change in time , therefore field simplifies to @xmath69 giving proper value for gravitational acceleration for stationary sko . +   + for moving test particle we would have @xmath70 for free - falling particle , gravitational acceleration should vanish , yielding @xmath71 what requests , that free - falling move with zero angular momentum will be in radial direction with local velocity @xmath72 +   + to derive gravitational acceleration for orbiting particle , let us at first multiply our field with @xmath73 obtaining new scalar fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 representing spatial velocity and time dilation of the test particle , with proper time of the particle denoted as @xmath6 @xmath76 where @xmath77 is unit vector that points direction of the particle s velocity .",
    "+   + we already know , from previous sections , that @xmath30 corresponds to conserved energy of the particle , therefore @xmath78 field is indeed velocity of test particle in sko s reference frame .",
    "if we consider test particle as moving with no acceleration ( move on geodesics ) , than it yields @xmath79 therefore gravitational field for such body could be rewritten , as : @xmath80 let us introduce our lagrangian , that corresponds to above @xmath81 from fundamental lemma of calculus of variations that stands behind euler - lagrange equation we know , that for generalized coordinates @xmath82 @xmath83 where in our case `` dot '' represents derivative with respect to sko s proper time noted as @xmath84 .",
    "+   + we know , that @xmath78 and @xmath85 are functions of @xmath84 then let us rewrite lagrangian as @xmath86 now , we calculate time derivatives @xmath87 we know from assumption ( [ assum ] ) that @xmath88 + we also know , that sko s time dilation factor does not change in time , since sko by definition is stationary in respect to gravitational source . +",
    "thanks to gravitational acceleration definition ( [ eq : gfield ] ) we therefore obtain @xmath89 what thanks to ( [ elcor ] ) let us to define gravitational acceleration as @xmath90 as we have already seen in previous sections , gradient of the lagrangian indeed gives expected gravitational acceleration value .",
    "+   + since we have derived gravitational field properties and lagrangian from fundamental properties of the calculus , it will work for all gr solution that conserves energy of the test particle .",
    "for other gr solutions ( e.g. kerr solution ) , the only diffrence wil be in definition of the gravitational dilation factor for sko . +   + it means , that gravity may be perceived as field for all gr solutions , that conserves relation ( [ epsil ] ) .",
    "it seems to be the solution for the problem of gravitomagnetic description of gravity ( gem ) considered e.g. in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we may check , if there are conserved vector field relations , which let us to derive dalambertian for the field that would describe gravitational waves .",
    "+   + we may easy check , that @xmath91 what thanks to ( [ eq : gfield ] ) is true . +   + to consider dalambertian for the field we also request @xmath92 we may transform above into condition for field . let us define four - potential @xmath93 next , thanks to vector field transformation properties we may transform ( [ con2 ] ) into condition @xmath94 for schwarzschild case , @xmath95 does not depend on time , therefore ( [ genconv ] ) simplifies to just @xmath96 as it is easy to calculate , introduced vector field @xmath68 for schwarzschild case satisfies this equation giving @xmath97 from above reasoning we see , that if we want to consider gravitational waves , we need time - dependent gravitational acceleration and/or time dependent free - falling velocity . +   +",
    "such situation for sure will take place for complex gravitational system , consisted of e.g. two co - interacting schwarzschild sources .",
    "such co - interacting entities would produce around time dependent @xmath98 fields , that depends of the phase of rotation of these entities .",
    "free - falling test particle in every particular point of its fall , may be considered as stationary sko observing free - falling gravitational source , thanks to idea of co - moving frames @xcite introduced at first in rindler transformation .",
    "+   + let us then check , how this field changes in time , if the source of gravity is free - falling onto sko .",
    "we define such free - falling velocity @xmath60 , as @xmath99 next let us calculate @xmath100 velocity gradient is to velocities what the deformation gradient is to displacements .",
    "since @xmath68 represents indeed some velocity , its four - gradient should be composition of some share and rotation , what we observe above .",
    "+   + we may separate this two elements by dividing velocity into radial and angular components @xmath101 let us introduce auxiliary @xmath102 representing rotation of the frame and equal to @xmath103 we also know from previous sections , that @xmath104 we know from gr that schwarzschild sources cause the spin of the test bodies exactly with the rate expressed in @xmath102 .",
    "let us therefore treat this quantity as the measure of the spin of the test bodies moving in vicinity of gravitational sources .",
    "+   + to avoid introducing intrinsic spin tensor , since this spin concerns all test bodies , it will be more convenient to consider test particle as rotating along imaginary axis .",
    "such `` imaginary axis rotation '' of test particle indeed represents the rotation of the gravitational source in test particle reference frame , caused by the test particle spin . +   + we may perform this operation using present ( [ metbase ] ) metric tensor @xmath105 as @xmath106 we may then just change metric tensor @xmath107 into @xmath14 defined in ( [ metten ] ) what will bring the same result .",
    "as we have already seen , such approach works fine and reproduces results of the schwarzschild case .",
    "spin rate incorporated into the metric in ( [ metreal ] ) brings some important consequence for the light and massless particles behavior in daf framework .",
    "+   + in the ( [ nospin ] ) we have already seen that this additional spin related component is the clue of the difference between propertime in daf and schwarzschild metric invariant , resulting with light speed equal to @xmath58 in daf picture .",
    "+   + in our previous article we have also pointed , that if we switch to the gravitational field oriented approach , then we must carefully choose reference frame , because gravity seems to change light speed into @xmath58 speed in distant observer reference frame .",
    "now we will solve this enigma .",
    "+   + first easy explanation would be , that for light and massless particles we can not consider spin , therefore in daf framework we should make special case for light and consider light with sko metric tensor @xmath108 defined in ( [ metbase ] ) without spin component .",
    "it sounds as the best solution , however light trajectory was correctly calculated for the metric @xmath109 with the spin included in the metric tensor as we seen in ( [ lighttraj ] ) .",
    "+   + we will then choose second explanation .",
    "suppose , that light indeed travels with @xmath110 speed in sko s reference frame with the metric defined by @xmath108 giving @xmath111 according to ( [ metreal ] ) we obtain its proper time coming only from its spin and equal to @xmath112 showing , that for massless particles , spin is the same for angular rotation and `` radial - to - propertime '' axis , exactly as we see in lorentz transformation expressed as hyperbolic rotation between time and radial axis @xcite . +   + it means , that massless particles indeed travels with c=1 speed in sko s reference frames , but we also may assign to them propertime and energy that comes from its spin .",
    "+   + this idea opens new area for exploration for origin of elementary particles rest energy as the energy stored in the spin .",
    "we have already shown in previous article @xcite , that rest energy @xmath113 of the massive body seems to be just planck limit of the energy stored in the spin of massless particle approximated with taylor series @xmath114 one could also use our research to reconsider electromagnetic field definition . as it is known , considering electromagnetic four - current @xmath115 we may make gauge - fixing introducing new scalar field @xmath84 and transforming @xmath116 and such transformation does not change electromagnetic field properties . if we consider @xmath84 as proper time , we would obtain similar description of electromagnetism that we present in daf approach .",
    "+   + therefore it seems quite easy to create electromagnetic version of daf framework similar way that we did for gravity , normalizing electromagnetic four - potential to dimensionless four - velocity and based on planck units .",
    "+   + our results from section [ gwaves ] also points , that if we would describe electromagnetic field similar way than we did for gravity , then we should rather treat charged elementary particle ( e.g. electron ) as complex system , consisted of some elementary entities ( e.g. planck particles ) interacting with time independent basic field ( e.g. @xmath117 ) . such complex particle , would produce all around time dependent field depending on the phase of rotation of internal entities , giving rise to the electromagnetic waves around .",
    "we have shown , that we can successfully reproduce schwarzschild case results using gravitational field oriented approach , based on daf framework and generalize it for other gr solutions .",
    "it means , that we are able to describe gravity as field and keep full compliance with gr .",
    "+   + what is the most interesting , we have shown , that by incorporating intrinsic spin into the metric , our understanding of the massless particles dynamics may be changed .",
    "it should open discussion about energy related to the spin and its consequences for rest energy of the elementary particles .",
