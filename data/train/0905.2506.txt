    "in recent years the running coupling of yang - mills theory has been investigated in a number of approaches ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "these include lattice qcd @xcite , analytic perturbation theory @xcite , the functional renormalization group @xcite , dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) @xcite and phenomenological extractions from experiment @xcite .",
    "the goal of these investigations is an extension of our knowledge of the coupling from the large momentum region towards small momenta of the order of @xmath1 and below .",
    "perturbation theory alone , plagued by the problem of the landau pole , is clearly insufficient for this task .",
    "however even improving the perturbation series with analytic constraints already leads to a well - defined coupling that has a fixed - point in the infrared @xcite .",
    "furthermore such fixed - points are also found in the frameworks of the functional renormalisation group and dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) . in these approaches",
    "nonperturbative running couplings can be defined in terms of ( gauge dependent ) dressing functions of the propagators and primitively divergent vertices of the theory .",
    "there are many possibilities to define renormalisation group invariant couplings from these vertices ; for a detailed discussion of the gauge and scheme dependence see @xcite . here",
    ", we consider a definition of the coupling from the four - gluon vertex given by @xcite @xmath2 \\ , z^2(p^2 )        \\ , , \\label{alpha-4g}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the coupling at the renormalization point @xmath4 and @xmath5 denotes the dressing function of the gluon propagator .",
    "the function @xmath6 describes the nonperturbative dressing of the tree - level tensor structure of the four - gluon vertex in the presence of only one external scale @xmath7 .",
    "here we used the asymmetric momentum point @xmath8 ; other choices are possible . both , @xmath5 and @xmath6",
    "are determined numerically from their dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "below we summarise our calculational scheme and results for @xmath9 as obtained in @xcite .    as discussed above , the infrared behaviour of the coupling eq .",
    "( [ alpha-4 g ] ) is of particular interest .",
    "in general , there are two different types of infrared solutions of yang - mills theory , denoted scaling and decoupling , discussed in detail in @xcite and refs . therein .",
    "here we summarise the results of @xcite , which have been obtained for infrared scaling , corresponding results for decoupling are subject of future work .",
    "the four - gluon vertex is a highly complicated object with four lorentz- and four color indices .",
    "this complexity forces a two step procedure : one first works with a restricted subset of possible combinations of lorentz- and color tensors .",
    "this reduced complexity allows for a first study of the most important properties of the vertex and its dyson - schwinger equation . on the basis of these results",
    "one can then attack the full problem in a second step .",
    "we will outline the most important parts of the first step ( a detailed treatment of can be found in @xcite ) leaving the second step for future investigations .",
    "a suitable subset of fifteen tensor - structures of the four - gluon vertex has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "implementing bose - symmetry further reduces the number of allowed structures to three , one being the tree - level structure .",
    "since these are quite lengthy we will not present them here , but refer to @xcite instead .      in compact notation",

    "\\label{4g - dse}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the vertex - blobs denote connected vertex functions which can be further decomposed into irreducible ones ( see @xcite ) .",
    "clearly the full dse is much to complicated to be calculated straightforwardly .",
    "instead we employ a truncation scheme , which results in a much simpler approximate equation , which contains the dominant ir and uv contributions and reproduces asymptotic freedom .",
    "this scheme is    * the fully dressed ghost and gluon propagators in the internal loops are taken from their own coupled system of dses as given in @xcite . *",
    "the vertices are decomposed into irreducible ones by means of a dressed skeleton expansion and n - point functions with @xmath11 are neglected . *",
    "the leading diagrams then are identified and the others are dropped .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "* selfconsistency effects of the four - gluon vertex will be neglected . *",
    "the dressed ghost - gluon vertex will be replaced by the bare vertex @xcite .",
    "* we employ an ansatz for the three - gluon vertex , which is constructed such that it has the infrared behaviour as given in @xcite and guarantees the correct uv - behaviour of the four - gluon dse as known from perturbation theory .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",

    "we determined the dressing functions of the four - gluon vertex numerically . using the result for the projection on the tree - level tensor - structure together with eq .",
    "( [ alpha-4 g ] ) we obtained the momentum dependence of the corresponding running coupling shown in fig .",
    "( [ res_coupling ] ) . also shown in the plot",
    "is the corresponding numerical result for the coupling from the ghost - gluon vertex as reported in ref .",
    "the renormalisation conditions used in both calculations are adapted such that the couplings agree in the ultraviolet momentum regime .",
    "the nonperturbative scale inherent in both couplings stems from the gluon propagator and therefore is the same for both calculations .",
    "consequently both couplings agree in the ultraviolet momentum regime as expected from perturbation theory .    at small momenta , however , the couplings start to deviate .",
    "both couplings develop an infrared fixed point which can be analysed analytically , see @xcite for details . here",
    "we find @xmath13 this value agrees well with our numerical result . note that the infrared fixed - point of the coupling from the four - gluon vertex is three orders of magnitudes smaller than the one from the ghost - gluon vertex .",
    "preliminary results also indicate that a corresponding coupling from the three - gluon vertex is of similar magnitude as our value for the four - gluon coupling @xcite . within the scaling scenario of infrared yang - mills theory adopted here",
    "this means that the small momentum properties are dominated by the behaviour of the faddeev - popov determinant in agreement with the analysis of zwanziger in ref .",
