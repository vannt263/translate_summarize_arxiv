    "the trd  @xcite of the alice experiment  @xcite at the lhc is devoted to electron identification  @xcite and tracking of charged particles .",
    "it provides also level-1 triggering on electrons and jets  @xcite .",
    "it is a cylindrical detector system located in radius between 2.9 and  3.7  meters from the beamline and segmented in 6 layers .",
    "it has a 2@xmath4 azimuthal coverage in 18 super - modules and a polar coverage between 45@xmath5 and 135@xmath5 in 5 stacks  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trdgeo ] ) .",
    "individual trd chamber consists of a 4.8 cm thick layer of fibres / foam sandwich radiator and a drift chamber filled with xe , co@xmath6 ( 15% ) .",
    "the depths of the drift and amplification regions are 3 cm and 0.7 cm respectively .",
    "the induced charges are readout by cathode pads which have a typical size of 0.7@xmath78.8 @xmath8  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trdprin ] ) every 100 ns .",
    "a charged particle loses energy in primary collisions with gas atoms by ionization ( de / dx ) .",
    "energetic ones with @xmath9 above @xmath10 in addition emit tr photons when passing through the radiator .",
    "the radial positions of the primary clusters are reconstructed from the drift time .",
    "therefore besides the energy loss measurement , the trd is also used for momentum determination .",
    "the trd signals presented in the following sections are the integrated charge over all drift time corrected for the non - perpendicular incident angle .",
    "the testbeam measurement was carried out at cern s ps in 2004  @xcite with secondary beams of pions and electrons of momenta from 1 to 10 gev / c . the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tbset ] .",
    "prototype chambers without ( with ) radiators were used for the de / dx ( de / dx+tr ) measurement .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fit0 ] the trd signal distributions from 3  gev / c testbeam pions and electrons are shown .",
    "both are fit with the following modified landau - gaussian convolution : @xmath11 where the landau distribution is weighted by an exponential damping @xmath12 this function is used also for distributions from proton - proton collisions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fitpp ] ) and cosmic runs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fitcos ] ) to extract the most probable energy loss .    since the end of march in 2010 , alice has collected data from proton - proton collisions at center - of - mass energy 7 tev .",
    "the trd signals are measured for protons , pions and electrons in minimum bias events .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "the trd energy loss measurements in the testbeam and proton - proton runs described in section  [ sec : tbpp ] do not cover the  @xmath0 range 10@xmath13  10@xmath14 which can be filled in by cosmic muons . because the alice detector is situated underground with 28 meters of material above , cosmic rays which leave long trajectories in the alice time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite are predominantly muons . because the tr photons are emitted in direction of the passage , they enter the drift section and are absorbed by the heavy gas when the particle traverses the radiator first .",
    "contrarily , only the de / dx signal is measured when the particle traverses the drift section and then the radiator .",
    "due to the cylindrical placement of the trd layers , de / dx signals are associated with the in - coming passages of the cosmic muons and de / dx+tr signals with the out - going ones  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cosdisplay ] ) .    in order to measure precisely the momenta of the muons ,",
    "a specific track fitting program was developed .",
    "compared to the standard tracking which only fits half of the muon trajectory in the tpc , the combined track fit uses all @xmath15 clusters  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cosdisplay ] ) and therefore achieves a 10 times better momentum resolution : the @xmath16-resolution is 8.1@xmath17 c / gev at momentum 1 tev / c ( integrated for all cosmic ray geometries in the tpc ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : oldnew ] shows the most probable trd de / dx+tr signals measured in the testbeam and cosmic runs . at @xmath0 above 10@xmath14 ,",
    "the cosmic ray signal by the standard tpc tracking flattens as a result of the limited momentum resolution . with",
    "the improvement provided by the combined track fit , the cosmic - ray and testbeam results are consistent up to @xmath18 , beyond which the statistics is limited .",
    "the standard alice 0.5 t solenoidal magnetic field is too strong for sub - gev muons to leave long trajectories in the tpc . in order to measure the muon minimum ionization signals in the trd , cosmic runs with a magnetic field of 0.1",
    "t were conducted .",
    "the momentum is determined by the standard tpc - trd tracking , which in addition to the standard tpc tracking also takes into account the space points in the trd .",
    "this is the first alice running at 0.1  t. the most probable trd signals from cosmic muons are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cosfull ] . by comparing the de / dx and de / dx+tr signals ,",
    "the tr onset is observed at @xmath19 .",
    "combining the testbeam , proton - proton collisions and cosmic ray measurements we obtained the trd energy loss signals in the @xmath0 range 1  10@xmath20  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dedxall ] ) . results from different measurements are consistent .",
    "the most probable ( mp ) trd de / dx signal in unit of minimum ionization is well described by the aleph  @xcite parameterization  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fitdedx ] ) : @xmath21}{\\beta^{2.26}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the fit result two numbers of practical interest can be deduced :    1 .   @xmath0 of minimum ionizing particle : 3.5 , 2 .",
    "de / dx in the relativistic limit : 1.7 times minimum ionization .",
    "fixing the de / dx contribution according to the aleph parameterization , the most probable de / dx+tr signal in unit of minimum ionization is well described by including an additional logistic function  ( fig .  [ fig : fitdedxtr ] ) : @xmath22 the following practical tr properties can be deduced :    1 .",

    "we have presented an overview of the energy loss @xmath24 in the alice trd , measured with prototypes in a testbeam and with the actual detector in proton - proton collisions and cosmic runs in the alice setup at the lhc . in the cosmic ray measurement",
    "we exploit the geometry of the detector to measure separately the de / dx and de / dx+tr signals in the trd .",
    "in addition , a combined track fit within the alice tpc was developed to exploit the full length of the track , leading to a @xmath16-resolution of 8.1@xmath17 c / gev at momentum 1 tev / c .",
    "the tr from tev cosmic muons is unambiguously observed .",
    "we have shown numerical descriptions of the signal spectra and of the dependence of the most probable energy loss on @xmath0 , which will allow to establish reference distributions for particle identification with trd over a broad momentum range ."
