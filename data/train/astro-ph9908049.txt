    "early work on black hole accretion disks pointed out the possibility that magnetic stresses might exert a torque on the inner parts of the accretion disk ( page & thorne 1974 , thorne 1974 , ruffini & wilson 1975 , king & lasota 1977 ) .",
    "however , in virtually every recent account of the dynamics of accretion disks around black holes , it has been assumed that there is no stress at the disk s inner edge , which should occur very close to the radius of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath4 . that this should be so was variously argued on the basis that the plunging matter in the region of unstable orbits has too little inertia to affect the disk , or rapidly becomes causally disconnected from the disk , or that such stresses were due to relatively weak transport processes that could not compete with the large gravitational forces pulling matter away from the disk .",
    "recently this view has been questioned ( krolik 1999 ) on the basis that magnetic fields are the likely agent of torque in accretion disks ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "if this is so , and their strength in the plunging region is what would be expected on the basis of flux - freezing , they should be strong enough in that zone to both make the alfvn speed relativistic ( postponing the point of causal decoupling ) and exert forces competitive with gravity .",
    "if matter inside the marginally stable orbit does , indeed , remain magnetically connected to the disk , it can exert a sizable torque on the the portion of the disk containing the field - line footpoints .",
    "gammie ( 1999 ) has shown that , within the confines of a highly - idealized model of inflow dynamics , this torque can considerably enhance the amount of energy released in the disk .",
    "in fact , even if there were no continuing accretion , field lines attached to the event horizon of a spinning black hole and running through the disk could exert torques of a very similar character ( blandford 1998 , d.m .",
    "eardley , private communication ) .",
    "we will call this situation the  infinite efficiency limit . \"",
    "a corollary of torque on the inner edge of the disk is an increase in the outward angular momentum flux . in a time - steady state",
    ", this additional angular momentum flux must be conveyed by additional stress .",
    "additional local dissipation must accompany the additional stress .",
    "it is the principal object of this paper to compute how this dissipation is distributed through the disk , and examine the consequences for observable properties .",
    "time - steady torques at @xmath4 are not the only way that energy may be transmitted from the plunging region to the disk  the torque may be variable , it may be delivered over a range of radii , and there may be radial forces exerted that carry no angular momentum . however , in this paper , we will restrict our attention to this simplest possible case .",
    "novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) and page & thorne ( 1974 ) showed how the surface brightness and vertically - integrated stress in the fluid frame for a time - steady , geometrically thin , relativistic accretion disk could be written as the newtonian forms multiplied by correction factors that approach unity at large radius . in the notation of page & thorne ( 1974 ) , conservation of angular momentum is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the boyer - lindquist radial coordinate , @xmath7 is the conserved specific angular momentum of a circular orbit at radius @xmath6 , @xmath8 is a function of radius defined such that the flux at the disk surface in the fluid frame @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the rest - mass accretion rate . as usual",
    ", @xmath11 is the angular frequency of a circular orbit at radius @xmath6 .",
    "we also follow novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) by defining four auxiliary functions : @xmath12 with @xmath13 the radius in units of @xmath14 and @xmath15 the dimensionless black hole spin parameter . in the usual approach ,",
    "the boundary condition on @xmath8 at the radius @xmath4 of the marginally stable orbit is @xmath16 .",
    "the appropriate boundary condition when there is non - zero stress at @xmath4 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the additional radiative efficiency relative to the one computed in terms of the binding energy at @xmath4 , @xmath20 , so that @xmath21 .",
    "this choice of @xmath22 ensures that the integrated additional dissipation matches @xmath23 , and corresponds to a stress @xmath24 we refer to a disk with @xmath25 as a `` novikov - thorne disk . ''",
    "using this boundary condition , the locally generated surface flux becomes @xmath26\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the expression found by novikov & thorne ( 1973 ) .",
    "the standard relativistic correction factor @xmath28 goes to zero as @xmath13 approaches @xmath29 from above , so that @xmath30 ( when the inner - edge stress is zero ) peaks well outside the marginally stable orbit .",
    "by contrast , the additional dissipation due to a torque on the inner edge is concentrated very close to @xmath4 , and is non - zero at the inner edge .",
    "the degree of concentration can be quantified by measuring @xmath31 , the radius within which fifty percent of the radiation is emitted : the half - light radius is a factor of a few smaller for torque - driven flux than for novikov - thorne flux .",
    "figure 1 shows the half - light radius for a novikov - thorne disk , @xmath32 , and an infinite - efficiency disk , @xmath33 , as a function of @xmath15 .    in the limit of infinite efficiency or zero accretion rate ,",
    "@xmath34 remains finite , so the first term in equation [ 8 ] dominates ; in this case , the flux scales as @xmath0 at large @xmath6 rather than as @xmath35 as in the standard thin disk .",
    "the expression for the surface flux becomes : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the eddington luminosity and @xmath38 is the thomson opacity per unit mass .",
    ".  half - light radii for the novikov - thorne disk ( dashed line ) and infinite - efficiency disk ( solid line ) . also plotted are @xmath4 ( dotted line ) and the region inside the horizon ( shaded ) .",
    "the angular momentum conservation equation corresponding to equation [ 8 ] is @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the torque correction factor ( novikov & thorne 1973 , page & thorne 1974 ) in the notation of krolik ( 1999 ) .    to clarify the meaning of the extra dissipation , we will write down equation [ 8 ] pretending that gravity is purely newtonian : @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the disk inner edge .",
    "the first term in the bracket is the usual shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 ) correction factor , while the second term is derived from the extra torque at the inner edge .",
    "this equation ( actually first derived by popham & narayan 1993 ) never applies in the relativistic case , but can apply , for example , to a disk around a star where a torque is exerted by the spinning magnetosphere or through a boundary layer , or to a thin disk surrounding a different disk solution , such as an adaf , where a torque is exerted by the flow inside the transition point .      to find the surface brightness distribution of the disk as seen by distant observers ,",
    "it is necessary first to correct the intrinsic surface brightness due to local dissipation for the additional energy supplied by photons originally emitted at a different radius , but returned to the disk by gravity . in the conventional picture",
    ", this is a small correction ( cunningham 1976 ) . here",
    ", however , because so much more of the energy is released deep in the relativistic potential , it can be a much greater effect .",
    "to compute the additional returning radiation , we followed the method developed by cunningham ( 1976 ) , with a few modifications .",
    "the numerical method is described in agol ( 1997 ) .",
    "we compute the flux transfer function , @xmath43 , by following photons emitted from each radius that return to the accretion disk , assuming the disk surface is flat and the radiation is isotropic in the fluid frame .",
    "we ignore the stress carried by these photons ( i.e. , we set @xmath44 in cunningham s parlance ) .",
    "we also assume that any radiation that returns to the disk inside @xmath4 is captured by the black hole ",
    "this radiation will be advected or scattered inwards by the inflowing gas , which has a large inward radial velocity .",
    "finally , we ( temporarily ) assume ( as does cunningham ) that the radiation returning to the disk is absorbed and thermalized before being reemitted ; this assumption is probably not appropriate in practice , but greatly simplifies computation of the transfer function since in this approximation @xmath43 is independent of frequency",
    ". we will discuss later how breaking this assumption may change the spectrum .    in figure 2a ,",
    "we plot versus radius the fraction of emitted radiation which returns to the disk outside @xmath4 , which enters the black hole or returns to the disk inside @xmath4 , and which reaches infinity directly , for the cases @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the fraction reaching infinity and returning to the disk are nearly independent of the black hole spin .",
    "the fraction returning to the disk is greater than 10% for @xmath47 , so when the emitted energy is concentrated inside this radius ( see figure 1 ) , then returning radiation will play an important role in modifying disk spectra . for @xmath48 ,",
    "less than half of the radiation reaches infinity directly - most returns to the disk . for @xmath46 , the fraction of radiation which is captured by the black hole or returns inside @xmath4 increases since @xmath4 is so large",
    "; this fraction never exceeds 8% .",
    "the fraction of returning radiation integrated over all radii , @xmath49 ( as measured at infinity ) , is shown ( as a function of @xmath15 ) in figure 2b ( dashed lines ) for two limiting efficiencies : @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the fraction for any other efficiency can be found by taking a linear combination of the fraction for these two efficiencies @xmath54 as can be seen from the figure , @xmath49 is relatively small for @xmath55 , even for @xmath52 .",
    "however , @xmath49 grows quickly with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "the primary reason for this is that @xmath4 shrinks with increasing @xmath15 , so that relativistic effects on the photon trajectories become more important .",
    "trajectory curvature is especially strong for those photons coming from small radii whose initial direction would carry them over the black hole . when @xmath15 and @xmath23 are comparatively large , up to 58% of the energy due to the extra dissipation ends up striking the disk .",

    "the heavy lines are for an infinite efficiency disk , while the lighter lines are for a novikov - thorne disk .",
    "the enhanced dissipation near @xmath4 also leads to an increase in the fraction of captured photons .",
    "we have computed this fraction integrated over all radii , @xmath56 , using the same general relativistic transfer code just described .",
    "our results for this effect are also illustrated in figure 2b , again for @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath58 results agree with thorne ( 1974 ) .",
    "equation [ [ fraction ] ] applies to @xmath56 as well .",
    "the fraction of locally generated radiation that ultimately escapes from the disk to infinity is simply @xmath59 .",
    "radiation that returns to the accretion disk we assume is reradiated isotropically and locally , and thus eventually reaches infinity or the black hole .",
    "we fold these multiply reprocessed photons into the final result . the nominal accretion efficiency , @xmath60 ,",
    "is then multiplied by @xmath61 to find the actual radiative efficiency of the flow .",
    "the largest @xmath56 is 0.15 , achieved for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the black hole bends the radiation back to the disk so that an observer on the disk sees the far side of the disk as a mirage above the black hole , which peaks in brightness within a few @xmath64 of the disk plane .",
    "the flux at large radius then scales as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 represents the flux - weighted height of the image above the disk plane .",
    "the ratio of the returning radiation to locally generated radiation , @xmath67 , varies as a function of radius . for a novikov - thorne disk",
    ", @xmath68 is infinite at @xmath4 , then decreases rapidly , asymptoting to a constant for @xmath69 . in the case of an infinite efficiency disk ( with @xmath70 ) , the locally generated surface brightness scales as @xmath0 at large radius , while the returning radiation scales as @xmath35 , so @xmath68 diverges as @xmath71 at large radius . for finite @xmath19",
    ", the returning flux may dominate at intermediate radii ; however , at large radius , @xmath68 asymptotes to a constant due to the fact that for large enough radius both returning and locally generated flux scale as @xmath35 . for @xmath72 and @xmath73 ,",

    "fitting formulae for this quantity are given in the appendix ; these formulae can be used to compute the returning flux at large radius for arbitrary @xmath76 . as can be seen in figure 3",
    ", the returning radiation can be a significant fraction of the locally generated radiation , and may therefore be important for construction of disk atmospheres .",
    "returning radiation can also lead to significant fluctuations on the light - crossing time , as discussed in  3.3 .",

    "accreting matter enters the black hole with a certain amount of angular momentum , changing the spin of the black hole . when there is no stress at the marginally stable orbit , the angular momentum absorbed per unit rest mass accreted is exactly the specific angular momentum of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath80 ( here we use conventional relativistic units in which @xmath81 ) .",
    "however , when there are stresses at @xmath4 , angular momentum is transferred from the matter inside @xmath4 to the disk .",

    "most of the photons emitted close to @xmath4 directed against the sense of black hole rotation are captured by the black hole , whereas fewer of the prograde photons fall into the hole .",

    "when accreted radiation is ignored , equation [ 17 ] simplifies to : @xmath111 this limit is accurate for @xmath112 , and only creates a significant error for @xmath113 , for the radiation torque is unimportant when the spin is relatively small .",

    "the spectrum is much broader than would be predicted by complete absorption , and returning radiation can cause a sharp rise in polarization towards the highest frequencies .",

    "the innermost regions of accretion disks are expected to be supported against the vertical component of gravity by radiation ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . in that case , the disk s vertical thickness is directly proportional to the ratio of the local radiation flux to the vertical component of gravity ; that is , @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the relativistic adjustment to the vertical gravity ( page & thorne 1974 ; abramowicz , lanza , & percival 1997 ) . at radii large enough that the relativistic effects are small , but not so large as to no longer be in the radiation - dominated regime in a novikov - thorne disk , @xmath182 should be constant . in the relativistic portion of the disk ,",
    "@xmath182 would shrink @xmath183 if the stress at its inner edge were zero ; additional dissipation , depending on its strength , could actually make the disk become somewhat thicker there ( cf .",

    "we plot some examples of @xmath184 in figure 13 . at the inner edge of the disk ,",
    "the height of the disk is non - zero when there is a non - zero torque , so the thin - disk approximation is valid only if @xmath185 .",

    "we have generalized the equations for an azimuthally symmetric , geometrically thin , time - steady accretion disk around a black hole to include the effects of a torque operating at the inner boundary , taken to be at @xmath4 .",
    "constant non - zero torque at @xmath4 causes several physical consequences that change the fundamental properties of the accretion flow :        \\3 ) the black hole spin can reach an equilibrium for @xmath201 since the angular momentum reaching the hole is smaller .",
    "radiation can also exert a significant torque on the black hole , which changes the value of the equilibrium - spin efficiency . above an efficiency of @xmath202",
    ", the black hole must always be spun down .",
    "\\4 ) since the extra emissivity is peaked at the inner edge of the disk , if @xmath4 is small then gravity causes a large fraction of the radiation ( up to 58% ) to return to the accretion disk .",
    "the flux of returning radiation scales as @xmath35 at large radius .",
    "up to 15% of the radiation can be captured by the black hole .",
    "\\5 ) the extra heating within the disk will increase the height of the disk if it is radiation pressure - supported .",
    "this limits severely the luminosity at which the thin - disk approximation is appropriate .",
    "\\6 ) doppler beaming and relativistic bending are strongest in the inner parts of the accretion disk where the extra flux peaks , so that for large @xmath15 and @xmath60 , the disk will be limb - brightened .",
    "\\1 ) the extra surface brightness changes the locally radiated spectrum . though the local surface brightness is usually not directly observable , it may be possible to map it using several devices : eclipse mapping ( baptista et al .",
    "1998 ) , although no eclipsing black hole x - ray binaries have been discovered yet ; quasar microlensing ( agol & krolik 1999 ) ; or reverberation mapping ( collier et al . 1999 ) .",
    "if the fe k@xmath2 emissivity is proportional to the local dissipation , these effects can strengthen the red wing of the line , particularly when the spin is small .",
    "this effect may undercut the argument that lines with strong red wings came from disks around black holes with higher spin ( e.g. dabrowski et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "several authors have used the novikov - thorne model to fit the soft x - ray spectra of galactic black hole candidates .",
    "their procedure was to estimate the effective radiating area required to emit the observed luminosity at the observed effective temperature . on the basis of these fits they inferred that some black holes have rather high spins because the effective radiating area of a novikov - thorne disk decreases with increasing spin ( zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ) .",
    "however , for fixed spin and central mass , a disk with large @xmath19 has a smaller effective radiating area than a novikov - thorne disk , mimicking the effect of greater spin .",
    "\\2 ) the outer parts of accretion disks can be unstable to warping due to irradiation from the center ( pringle 1996 ) .",
    "the minimum radius for growth of small warps is proportional to @xmath203 ; if the efficiency is much higher than that of a standard disk , the minimum radius may be greatly shrunk .",
    "limb - brightening increases the effective efficiency and therefore makes the linear growth more rapid ; on the other hand , the corresponding relative decrease in intensity away from the central disk plane may weaken this effect in the non - linear regime .",
    "\\3 ) wavelength - dependent limb - brightening ( or limb - darkening ) introduces viewing angle - dependent biases into any flux - limited sample .",
    "this is a particularly strong effect in the context of quasar surveys because the number count distribution is so steep .",
    "a variety of distortions could occur in our view of what constitutes a  typical \" quasar ( cf . krolik & voit 1998 ) .",
    "\\4 ) returning radiation can change the conditions for launching a radiation - driven disk wind ( e.g. murray et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the returning radiation is reradiated locally , so the net vertical force depends on the frequency - averaged opacities of the downgoing and upgoing radiation fields .",
    "the radial component of the radiation force will be larger than for a standard disk due to the higher efficiency and limb brightening .",
    "\\5 ) returning radiation causes the various annuli to `` communicate '' on the light crossing timescale .",
    "fluctuations of the flux at small radii will cause only slightly delayed fluctuations of the flux at larger radii , which emit at longer wavelengths .",
    "indeed , exactly this sort of behavior is commonly seen in accreting black hole systems .",
    "for example , campaigns monitoring agn have consistently found that continuum fluctuations are very nearly simultaneous all the way from @xmath204     to @xmath205     ( clavel et al . 1991 ; korista et al . 1995 ; wanders et al .",
    "1997 ; collier et al . 1998 ; obrien et al .",
    "1998 ; cutri et al .",
    "1985 ) . comparing the upper bounds on any inter - band delays to the radial scales expected on the basis of conventional disk models , these observations have been interpreted as requiring a coordinating signal group speed of at least @xmath206 ( e.g. , krolik et al . 1991 ; courvoisier & clavel 1991 ; collier et al . 1998 ) .",
    "\\6 ) the scattered component of returning radiation is highly polarized parallel to the disk axis at high frequencies .",
    "this polarization rise may be related to the observed sharp rises in several quasars ( koratkar et al .",
    "1995 , impey et al .",
    "if the inner regions of the disk have a strong lyman continuum in emission , then this scattered emission edge will appear as a strongly polarized , blueshifted emission edge in the spectrum . in an irradiated disk atmosphere there might be an additional effect : heating of the upper layers of the atmosphere can cause a temperature inversion , which changes the sense of the polarization .",
    "we leave all such detailed calculations to future work .",
    "a question left unanswered by this work is what spin and efficiency we expect to be achieved by black holes in nature . that there is an upper limit on efficiency for an equilibrium spin means that a black hole with @xmath207 must be born with original spin , or must be spun up by accretion in which magnetic torques inside @xmath4 do not play an important role . in the supermassive black hole case",
    ", the spin may result from a merger .",
    "no one has computed the final spin of the resulting merger of two black holes ; however , current approximate calculations indicate that the final spin could be quite large ( khanna et al .",
    "the strength of the torque at @xmath4 depends on the strength of the magnetic field in the accretion disk and the geometrical thickness of the flow , which in turn depend on the accretion rate .",
    "this dependence will be best addressed with numerical simulations of mhd accretion .",
