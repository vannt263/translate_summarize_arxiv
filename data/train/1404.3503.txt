    "the connection of the shell , collective @xcite and cluster models @xcite , found in terms of the su(3 ) symmetry in 1958 , was based on a single - shell problem , described in spherical basis , related to simple symmetries . in a pevious paper @xcite the extension to multi - major shells",
    "was addressed , and the u(3 ) @xmath1 u(3 ) @xmath2 u(3 ) dynamical symmetry was found as the common intersection of the three models .",
    "here we consider the role of more general symmetries and the case of large deformation .",
    "so far two kinds of the su(3 ) symmetry were applied in this respect .",
    "i ) the exact symmetry , in which case both the hamiltonian is symmetric , i.e. it is an su(3 ) scalar , and its eigenvectors are symmetric , i.e. they transform according to irreducible representations ( irreps ) .",
    "ii ) the dynamical su(3 ) symmetry ( sometimes called dynamically broken symmetry ) , when the eigenvectors are still symmetric , but the interactions are not .",
    "this kind of special breaking is achieved by incorporating an interaction which is expressed in terms of the invariant operator of the so(3 ) subgroup , in addition to the su(3 ) scalar part .",
    "the relation between the shell and collective models , established by elliott @xcite was based on the su(3 ) @xmath2 so(3 ) dynamical symmetry .",
    "the wildermuth - connection between the shell and cluster models was originally based on harmonic oscillator hamiltonians of exact su(3 ) symmetry , but it turns out to be valid also for the dynamical symmetry , as discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "here we consider the more general quasi - dynamical su(3 ) symmetry @xcite which turns out to be important , too .",
    "therefore , in the next section we discuss very briefly the hierarchy of symmetries ( or symmetry - breaking ) , relevant for the connection of the fundamental structure models .",
    "we also describe the cluster - shell competition in terms of quantum phases , being closely related to symmetries",
    ". then we investigate the case of large defomations , with special emphasis on the symmetries of the super- and hyperdeformation , in the presence of realistic ( nilsson - type ) interactions .",
    "before the concluding part we devote a short section to the comparison of different kinds of extensions of elliott s original su(3 ) symmetry , which are relevant from the present viewpoint .",
    "the @xmath3ne nucleus is applied for illustrative purposes , just like in @xcite .",
    "the quasi - dynamical ( or effective ) u(3 ) symmetry @xcite is a generalization of the concept of the u(3 ) dynamical symmetry in the following sense .",
    "the hamiltonian breaks the symmetry in such a way that the u(3 ) quantum numbers are not valid for its eigenvectors ( contrary to the case of the real u(3 ) dynamical symmetry ) .",
    "in other words neither the operator is symmetric , nor its eigenvectors @xcite .",
    "( for comparison with the exact and dynamical symmetries see table i. ) yet , the symmetry is present in some sense , and it may survive even for strong symmetry - breaking interactions @xcite . then the energy eigenstates are : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a basis vector for an su(3 ) irreducible representation , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are additional quantum numbers needed to specify the wavefunction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 coefficients of the linear combination are independent of @xmath9 , i.e. within a band the contribution of different su(3 ) basis states is the same .",
    "( this situation is called adiabatic approximation . ) when calculating the matrix elements of the su(3 ) generators between these states the result may approximate the matrix elements of an exact representation . in such a case",
    "we speak about an approximate embedded representation , and related to it , about an approximate quasi - dynamical or effective su(3 ) symmetry .",
    ".different su(3 ) symmetries in nuclear stucture models .",
    "the signs + and - indicate if the hamiltonian and its eigenvectors are symmetric or not .",
    "the operator is said to be symmetric , if it is a scalar , while a set of eigenvectors is symmetric if they transform according to irreducible representations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tab : shis ] compares the results of the present calculations with those of the earlier determination of shape isomers using nilsson model potential energy surfaces  @xcite , and the bloch - brink alpha - cluster model  @xcite .",
    "leander and larsson list three shape isomers @xcite , each of which is very close to our present ones .",
    "the alpha - cluster studies found all the four shape isomers , we see here .",
    "their u(3 ) symmetries are in coincidence with those of the simple harmonic oscillator configurations approximating the effective quantum numbers .",
    "it is remarkable that the instability of the shape in the ground state region , shown by the curvature in fig .",
    "[ fig : lepcsos ] , is observed also in the bloch - brink calculations @xcite ; they mention two close - lying states with very similar configurations",
    ".      the u(3 ) connection @xcite between the collective , shell and cluster models works well in case i ) the u(3 ) symmetry is approximatelly valid , and ii ) the relation between the cluster and shell model wavefunctions is simple .",
    "this latter condition means that the expansion of the cluster u(3 ) state in terms of shell basis reduces to a few terms .    as discussed in the previous subsection the u(3 ) symmetry recovers for the superdeformed , hyperdeformed , etc shapes , in spite of the important role of the symmetry - breaking spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the second condition ( on the simple shell model expansion ) turns out to be valid also for several shape isomers .",
    "e.g. in case of the @xmath3ne nucleus each of the 4 shape isomers ( of the u(3 ) symmetry : [ 12,4,4 ] , [ 16,8,0 ] , [ 24,4,0 ] , [ 40,0,0 ] ) has single multiplicity in the shell model basis .",
    "therefore , if a cluster state with the same u(3 ) symmetry is allowed it is identical with the shell state .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the cluster state can be expanded in terms of shell basis , and basis states of different u(3 ) irreps are orthogonal to each other .",
    "( both the shell and cluster states are normalized . )    in general : the u(3 ) selection rule for determining the allowed clusterization is : @xmath10 = [ n^{c_1}_1 , n^{c_1}_2 , n^{c_1}_3 ] \\otimes   [ n^{c_2}_1 , n^{c_2}_2 , n^{c_2}_3 ] \\otimes   [ n^{r } , 0 , 0],\\ ] ] where @xmath11 $ ] is the u(3 ) symmetry of the shell model state , @xmath12 $ ] is that of the @xmath13th cluster , and @xmath14 $ ] stands for the relative motion .",
    "when the shell model irrep matches with one of the results of the triple product of the right hand side , the cluster configuration is allowed .",
    "in addition to the u(3 ) selection , there is another simple prescription by harvey @xcite for the determination of the allowed clusterizations .",
    "it also applies harmonic oscillator basis , so the two requirements are somewhat similar .",
    "nevertheless , their physical content is not the same ; in some sense they are complementary to each other .",
    "therefore , the best way is to apply them in a combined way @xcite .",
    "( their relation is discussed more in detail in @xcite . ) when a cluster configuration is forbidden , one can characterize its forbiddenness quantitatively @xcite .",
    "the energetic preference represents a complementary viewpoint for the selection of clusterization .",
    "we usually incorporate it in two different ways : i ) by applying simple binding - energy arguments @xcite , and ii ) by performing double - folding calculations , according to the dinuclear system model @xcite .    the alpha - like ( n = z = even ) cluster configurations are energetically preferred , in general .",
    "when considering binary clusterizations with both clusters in their intrinsic ground state , then the gs state of @xmath3ne allows both @xmath15o+@xmath16he , and @xmath17c+@xmath18be clusterizations .",
    "the latter configuration is present also in the sd and hd states , while the linear alpha - chain can not be built up from two ground - state clusters . due to the single shell model multiplicity of these shape isomers",
    ", one can say that to the extent the u(3 ) symmetry is valid , these states can be considered , as the cluster configurations mentioned before .",
    "in fig . [ fig : elliott ] we illustrate some generalizations of elliott s su(3 ) symmetry into different directions . in its original form it proved to be effective for light nuclei of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 shell , for a single major shell problem .",
    "the vertical extension along the shell - excitation has been discussed in detail in @xcite .    ,",
    "height=245 ]    several approaches have been invented in order to export the elegant and powerful technique of the group theory to the medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "the interacting boson model @xcite uses a method ( by introducing bosons of coupled valence nucleons ) which is applicable for a single ( or a few ) major shell .",
    "this model has a u(6 ) group structure , and one of its dynamical symmetries : u(6)@xmath2su(3)@xmath2so(3 ) describes the rotational spectra of deformed nuclei .",
    "the ibm model has been applied to heavy nuclei in a very wide range .",
    "the pseudo - su(3 ) symmetry associates the su(3 ) irrep of the @xmath21-th major shell to a subset of the states in the @xmath22-th major shell .",
    "it appears due to a special ratio of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 interactions @xcite .",
    "thus the nucleon states are divided into two categories , and one of them carries the su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "this approach can treat several major shells in a similar manner .",
    "the quasi - dynamical su(3 ) symmetry , as discussed beforehand , builds up from the contribution of many nucleons in a `` democratic '' way , i.e. no distinction is made between the single particle levels .",
    "it turns out that this symmetry may survive in the presence of different symmetry - breaking interactions , like e.g. spin - orbit and pairing @xcite .",
    "the extension towards the very light nuclei is related to the quasi - su(3 ) symmetry ( not to be mixed up with the quasi - dynamical symmetry , mentioned before ) @xcite and no - core shell model ( ncsm ) .",
    "the quasi - su(3 ) is a symmetry of the shell model , and in the @xmath25 coupled proton - neutron formalism it results in an efficient truncation scheme : only the low spin components and su(3 ) basis states of large deformation give important contribution @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that it turned out to be effective also with realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions in ab intio calculations @xcite .",
    "the generalization to deformed basis and large deformation has been discussed in the previous section .",
    "in the present and the previous paper we have discussed the extension of the su(3 ) connection between the shell , collective and cluster models . this relation was established in 1958 @xcite for a single major shell , by applying spherical basis of the exact or dynamically broken symmetry . in @xcite",
    "we considered the vertical extension , i.e. the incorporation of major shell excitations .",
    "here we discussed further generalization along the symmetry - breaking and large deformation .",
    "the cluster - shell competition or coexistence has been interpreted in terms of the joint phase diagram of the shell and cluster models .",
    "three different ( shell , cluster and quasi - cluster ) calculations indicate the position of the ground - band of @xmath3ne very close to the su(3 ) matching point of the two models .",
    "concerning the large deformations the quasi - dynamical su(3 ) symmetry is found to be stabil for nilsson - type interactions for several shapes with commensurable ratios of the main axes .",
    "all these considerations , as well as many others , are based on the extension of elliott s su(3 ) symmetry . in figure 3",
    "we summarized some of its generalization along different directions : excitation energy , mass number and deformation .",
