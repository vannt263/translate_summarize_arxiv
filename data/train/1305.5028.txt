    "the cut locus @xmath2 of a point @xmath3 in a riemannian or finsler manifold is , roughly speaking , the set of all other points for which there are multiple minimizing geodesics connecting them from @xmath3 . of course , in some special cases , it may contain additional points where the minimizing geodesic is unique .    the notion of cut locus",
    "was introduced and studied for the first time by h. poincar in 1905 for the riemannian case .",
    "later on , in the case of a two dimensional analytical sphere , s. b. myers has proved in 1935 that the cut locus of a point is a finite tree ( @xcite ) in both riemannian and finslerian cases . moreover , in the case of an analytic riemannian manifold , m. buchner has shown the triangulability of @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , and has determined its local structure for the low dimensional case ( @xcite ) in 1977 and 1978 , respectively .    despite of the vast literature existing for the riemannian case , the investigations of the cut locus of a finsler manifolds are scarce ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , it was shown that the cut locus of a closed subset @xmath4 of a finsler surface has the structure of a local tree being a union of rectifiable jordan arcs ( @xcite ) .",
    "even though the results are similar to the riemannian case , showing that there is nothing special about the metric structure to be riemannian , one should pay always attention to the fact that , unlike its riemannian correspondent , the finslerian distance is not symmetric , so the proofs and arguments are quite different .    returning to the riemannian case , in the case of an arbitrary metric , the cut locus of a point can have a very complicated structure .",
    "for example , h. gluck and d. singer have constructed a @xmath5 riemannian manifold that has a point whose cut locus is not triangulable ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is a closed relationship between the complexity of the cut locus and the regularity of the metric , regardless it is riemannian or finslerian . indeed ,",
    "if the metric has a certain degree of regularity , then the cut locus of a point may enjoy a simple structure .",
    "however , if the metric loses its regularity , the cut locus might become a very complicated set , for example a fractal .",
    "recall that , roughly speaking , a fractal is a set whose hausdorff dimension is not an integer ( see @xcite for alternative definitions and examples ) , fact that make fractals typical examples of what we call complicated sets \" .",
    "let us mention that the cut locus of any point on a @xmath5 riemannian manifold can not be a fractal ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a @xmath6 riemannian metric on the two dimensional sphere @xmath7 and a point @xmath8 such that the total length of @xmath2 is infinite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by all these , in the present paper , we are going to study the following two questions :    _ _    1 .",
    "there exists riemannian metrics having points whose cut locus is a fractal ? 2 .",
    "there are more general metric structures , for example finsler metrics , with the same property ?",
    "the answer to both questions above is affirmative .",
    "indeed , in the present paper we construct an at least @xmath1 differrentiable , @xmath9 , riemannian metric on a topological sphere @xmath10 , provided the dimension @xmath11 is high enough , namely , we prove    [ theorem a ] for any integer @xmath9 there is an at least @xmath1-differentiable riemannian metric on the @xmath12-dimensional sphere @xmath13 and a point @xmath3 in @xmath13 such that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 is a real number between 1 and 2 , where @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , we show that there is a finsler metric of randers type on this sphere with the same property . indeed ,",
    "if we use the same notations as in theorem [ theorem a ] , we have    [ theorem b ] for any integer @xmath9 , under the influence of a suitable magnetic field @xmath15 defined on @xmath13 , there is an at least @xmath1-differentiable non - riemannian finsler metric of randers type on @xmath13 such that the cut locus of the point @xmath3 with respect to this finsler metric coincides with @xmath2 .",
    "in this section , we will construct :    * an infinite tree @xmath16 in @xmath17 with the end points set @xmath18 , * a closed , convex ball @xmath19 in @xmath17 with @xmath20-boundary that contains @xmath16 and @xmath21 .",
    "the set @xmath18 is actually a fractal whose hausdorff dimension is a value between 1 and 2 ( see @xcite for definitions ) .",
    "we begin by defining three infinite series of numbers @xmath22 where @xmath23 is an arbitrary fixed angle and @xmath0 a fixed integer .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are monotone decreasing series that converge to zero , for @xmath27 .",
    "we will use these in order to construct a fractal set in @xmath17 . for the moment we do not assume any relation between @xmath11 and @xmath1 .",
    "let us consider in @xmath17 the points @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , defined as follows .",

    "@xmath49 is the unit vector with all components zero except the @xmath50-th component which is 1 , namely @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "one can easily see that the points @xmath54 are all on the sphere with center @xmath55 and radius @xmath56 , for any fixed @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 .    for later use",
    "we denote the segment between @xmath28 and @xmath29 by @xmath60 , the segment between @xmath29 and @xmath61 by @xmath62 and so on inductively , such that the segment between @xmath55 and @xmath63 will be denoted by @xmath64 .",
    "likely , we denote the ray from @xmath28 that contains @xmath29 by @xmath65 , the ray from @xmath29 that contains @xmath62 by @xmath66 and so on inductively , such that the ray from @xmath55 that contains @xmath64 will be denoted by @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 , @xmath69 be the union of segments @xmath64 , @xmath70 be the infinite tree and let @xmath71 be the set of points @xmath72 .",
    "taking into account and the construction above , one can see that @xmath73 implies @xmath74 is finite , therefore the edges can not prolong to infinity , so the set @xmath75 must have a subset of limit points @xmath76 .",
    "the set @xmath18 is in fact the set of _ end points _ of the infinite tree @xmath16 , except the root point @xmath28 ( see figure 1 ) .",
