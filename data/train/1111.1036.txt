    "this paper is concerned with the semiclassically scaled modified nonlinear schrdinger ( mnls ) equation : @xmath0 which can be thought of as a perturbation ( with perturbation parameter @xmath1 ) of the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation : @xmath2 taken in the so - called focusing case of @xmath3 .",
    "( for @xmath4 one has the so - called defocusing case . )",
    "our goal is to describe connections between the mnls equation on the one hand and the nls equation ( perhaps surprisingly , both focusing and defocusing types are related to mnls ) on the other , connections that become especially clear in the semiclassical limit @xmath5 .",
    "erwin madelung was probably the first person to propose thinking of schrdinger - type equations for a complex field @xmath6 as describing the motion of a kind of fluid @xcite .",
    "he introduced the real - valued fluid dynamical variables @xmath7 ( density ) and @xmath8 ( velocity ) given in terms of @xmath9 by @xmath10 here @xmath11 is defined by continuation to be a smooth function of @xmath12 .",
    "a key observation is that if the complex - valued field @xmath13 initially has the form of an oscillatory wavepacket : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are real - valued functions independent of @xmath17 , then the corresponding initial values of the madelung variables are independent of @xmath17 as well : @xmath18 without approximation , the nls equation can be written in terms of the madelung variables as : @xmath19}{\\partial x } \\label{eq : madelungnls}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 $ ] denotes the expression @xmath21:=\\frac{1}{2\\rho}\\frac{\\partial^2\\rho}{\\partial x^2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\rho}\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 .",

    "the @xmath25 truncated system of equations @xmath26 which we call the _ dispersionless nls system _ , is really a classical euler system of compressible fluid ( gas ) dynamics .",
    "the term @xmath27 in the flux for @xmath28 represents the pressure as a function of density .",
    "if @xmath4 ( the defocusing case of the nls equation ) then the pressure is an increasing function of the gas density and the physical dynamics is that of the gas `` trying to get out of its own way '' ; localized concentrations in density tend to decay with time . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath3 ( the focusing case of the nls equation ) then the pressure decreases with increasing density and localized concentrations in density are dynamically enhanced . in physical problems with such pressure laws , like supercooled van der waals gases ,",
    "initially small but nonuniform perturbations of a uniform density lead quickly to spontaneous condensation of the gas into liquid droplets .",
    "mathematically , the equations comprise a quasilinear system of hyperbolic type for @xmath4 , and the cauchy initial - value problem for such systems is locally well - posed in suitable function spaces . on the other hand when @xmath3 we have instead a system of elliptic type , and the cauchy problem is ill - posed .",
    "the ill - posedness of the cauchy initial - value problem for the @xmath25 system in the focusing ( @xmath3 ) case can be regarded as a manifestation of the well - known modulational instability of the focusing nls equation .",
    "this instability becomes increasingly severe for @xmath5 and is asymptotically catastrophic in the semiclassical limit @xmath29 .",
    "the modulational instability can lead to unwanted physical effects in systems modeled by the focusing nls equation .",
    "for example , the gordon - haus jitter effect of pulses in optical fiber telecommunications systems is caused at least in part by the modulational instability .",
    "in such situations , physical effects originally neglected to derive a simple model equation ( the focusing nls equation ) might play a role in reducing the influence of the instability .",
    "one effect that can be included perturbatively is nonlinear dispersion , and including such a term results in the mnls equation in place of the focusing nls equation . obviously if @xmath30 the mnls equation becomes the focusing nls equation , but for @xmath31 the dynamics can be different , perhaps usefully so .    in terms of the madelung fluid - dynamical variables the mnls equation becomes @xmath32}{\\partial x } , \\label{eq : mnlsmadelung}\\ ] ] where again @xmath20 $ ] is given by .",
    "the formal limit system ( set @xmath25 ) is in this case the _ dispersionless mnls system _ @xmath33",
    "this quasilinear system is obviously an @xmath1-perturbation of the corresponding elliptic - type dispersionless nls system with @xmath3 . unlike the @xmath30 case , the system is of mixed type , being hyperbolic for @xmath34 and elliptic for @xmath35 , where @xmath36 this simple calculation suggests that the modulational instability of the focusing nls equation ( @xmath30 ) can be completely suppressed by nonlinear dispersion ( @xmath31 ) for initial data satisfying the condition @xmath37 .",
    "quasilinear systems of mixed type occur frequently in problems of transsonic gas dynamics . in regions of spacetime where the gas velocity is subsonic ( respectively supersonic ) ,",
    "the equations are of elliptic ( respectively hyperbolic ) type . throughout this paper we will use this terminology in the context of the mixed - type system also . to make this analogy more obvious",
    ", we can define a density - dependent _ sound speed _ for the dispersionless mnls system by @xmath38 and then recalling that @xmath39 has the interpretation of fluid velocity , the condition of hyperbolicity for the system becomes the supersonic condition @xmath40 while that of ellipticity of the system becomes the subsonic condition @xmath41 .",
    "the fact that the dispersionless mnls system can be either hyperbolic like the dispersionless defocusing nls system ( with @xmath4 ) or elliptic like the dispersionless focusing nls system ( with @xmath3 ) depending on the sign of @xmath42 establishes a qualitative connection between these systems in the semiclassical limit .",
    "however , the connection is far more concrete as was shown in @xcite .",
    "indeed , let us suppose that @xmath43 and @xmath39 are functions satisfying the dispersionless mnls system and the ( supersonic ) hyperbolicity condition @xmath40 . then if new fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in terms of @xmath43 and @xmath39 by the algebraic mapping @xmath46 it is easy to check that the pair @xmath47 constitutes ( after dropping the `` hats '' ) a solution of the dispersionless defocusing nls system ( with @xmath4 ) .",
    "similarly , if @xmath43 and @xmath39 solve the dispersionless mnls system and satisfy the ( subsonic ) ellipticity condition @xmath41 , and if new fields @xmath44 and @xmath45 are instead defined by @xmath48 then @xmath47 constitutes a solution of the dispersionless focusing nls system ( with @xmath3 ) .",
    "note that both mappings and preserve the positivity of the madelung fluid density @xmath49 .",
    "this simple calculation reveals the remarkable fact that , in the semiclassical limit , the dynamics of the mnls equation can be exactly mapped onto either the dynamics of the defocusing nls equation or those of the focusing nls equation depending only on the sign of @xmath42 .",
    "one of our aims in writing this paper is to show how the formal observations made above can be placed on completely rigorous mathematical footing , and also how the interesting transsonic case where @xmath42 is sign - indefinite can be analyzed with great precision in the semiclassical limit .",
    "the main tool here is the exact solution of the cauchy initial - value problem for the mnls equation by means of the _ inverse spectral transform _ specially adapted to that equation .",
    "we also wish to make a comparison with the solution of the nls equations of both focusing and defocusing types , which is carried out by a better - known inverse spectral transform .      for the reader s convenience , we give here a very brief description ( adapted from the appendix of @xcite ) of the calculations involved with implementation of the inverse - spectral",
    "transform for the mnls initial - value problem .",
    "let @xmath50 denote the complex - valued initial condition for the mnls equation , a function that may depend parametrically on @xmath51 as in the wavepacket case and that is assumed for convenience to be of schwartz class .",
    "let @xmath52 be a complex spectral parameter .",
    "given @xmath53 , the _ jost matrices _",
    "@xmath54 are ( uniquely ) defined for @xmath55 to satisfy the linear differential equation @xmath56 where the coefficient matrix @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 and where @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 as well as the asymptotic normalization conditions @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "the jost matrix solutions are unimodular for all @xmath63 and @xmath55 , and in particular are fundamental matrix solutions of .",
    "since the differential equation can have only two linearly independent column vector solutions , the columns of @xmath64 are linear combinations of those of @xmath65 and hence there exists a @xmath66 unimodular _ scattering matrix _",
    "@xmath67 defined for @xmath55 by @xmath68 in particular , the ratio @xmath69 is called the _ reflection coefficient _ corresponding to the potential @xmath53 ; @xmath70 should be viewed as a kind of transform of @xmath71 derived from the behavior of solutions of as @xmath52 varies through the continuous spectrum . by comparing the jost solutions for @xmath72 with those for @xmath52",
    "it can be shown that @xmath73 is an odd function of @xmath52 .",
    "there is in general also information about @xmath53 encoded in the discrete spectrum of the problem .",
    "it turns out that the second column of @xmath74 and the first column of @xmath75 can be analytically continued into the region @xmath76 .",
    "it follows that @xmath77 extends analytically to the region @xmath76 . if @xmath78 with @xmath79 is a zero of @xmath77 , then it is easy to see that @xmath80 and @xmath81 are proportional , and hence there exists a nonzero constant @xmath82 such that @xmath83 holds for all @xmath63 .",
    "such @xmath84 are _ eigenvalues _ or _ discrete spectrum _ of the differential equation because it can be shown that the condition of proportionality implies the existence of a solution of for @xmath84 that is exponentially decaying both as @xmath85 and also as @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath53 is such that it turns out that @xmath77 has a finite ( for fixed @xmath51 ) number of zeros in its domain of analyticity , all of which are simple zeros ( so that @xmath87 , where prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath52 ) , and that @xmath88 does not vanish at all for @xmath89 , then the corresponding solution @xmath6 of the mnls equation with initial condition @xmath53 can be obtained from the _ scattering data _ consisting of the reflection coefficient @xmath90 for @xmath89 together with the pairs @xmath91 corresponding to the discrete spectrum by the solution of a _ matrix riemann - hilbert problem_.    the riemann - hilbert problem can be formulated to take advantage of a certain symmetry of the differential equation under the reflection @xmath92 .",
    "thus we introduce the spectral variable @xmath93 and seek a @xmath66 matrix @xmath94 satisfying the following conditions ( @xmath95 , where @xmath96 denotes the matrix solution of the riemann - hilbert problem as formulated in the appendix of @xcite and where @xmath97 denotes the principal branch of the square root ) .",
    "let @xmath98 and for @xmath99 set @xmath100 finally , let @xmath101 denote the finite set @xmath102 .",

    "as was first shown by zakharov and shabat @xcite , the initial - value problem for the nls equation with schwartz - class initial data @xmath53 can be solved by means of the scattering problem @xmath125 where the coefficient matrix @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a spectral parameter . here as before @xmath129 are jost matrices satisfying the boundary conditions that @xmath130 as @xmath62 , and once again one defines a scattering matrix @xmath131 by the relation @xmath132 and a reflection coefficient by @xmath133 this completes the description of the scattering data associated with the continuous spectrum of the direct scattering problem .",
    "if @xmath4 ( the defocusing case ) , then as an eigenvalue problem with eigenvalue @xmath134 , the scattering problem is self - adjoint for @xmath53 schwartz class , and there can be neither complex eigenvalues nor embedded real ones .",
    "but if @xmath3 ( the focusing case ) , then selfadjointness is lost and there can be discrete spectrum . to find the associated scattering data , note that the second column of @xmath135 and the first column of @xmath136 extend analytically into the upper half - plane @xmath137 , and hence so does @xmath138 . while for @xmath4 the latter function is bounded away from zero in the closed upper half - plane , if @xmath3 it may have zeros , which are the discrete eigenvalues of the problem for @xmath3",

    "is quite remarkable : there is a sense in which the direct and inverse spectral transforms for the mnls initial - value problem with globally hyperbolic ( respectively elliptic ) initial data are _ virtually indistinguishable _ in the semiclassical limit @xmath5 from those for the defocusing ( respectively focusing ) nls initial - value problem with data obtained from the mnls initial data via or as appropriate .    in a final section",

    "we are very pleased to be able to contribute our work to this volume of papers in honor of the 85th birthday of peter lax .",
    "peter s interest in dispersionless limits goes back at least to his consideration of von neumann s conjecture that oscillations produced upon shock formation by a finite difference scheme for the integration of a system of partial differential equations of gas dynamics should `` on average '' ( that is , in the sense of weak convergence as the grid is refined ) reproduce the correct entropy shock profile . in his groundbreaking work in",
    "the early 1980 s with c. d. levermore on the zero - dispersion limit of the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite , peter showed that von neumann s conjecture was false ( see @xcite for more information about this interesting problem ) .",
    "for initial data @xmath161 of wavepacket form , the semiclassical parameter @xmath5 enters into the differential equation in two essential ways : as a factor multiplying the derivatives with respect to @xmath12 on the left - hand side , and also in oscillatory exponential factors @xmath162 residing in the off - diagonal elements of the coefficient matrix @xmath57 on the right - hand side . in this section",
    "we present some calculations indicating how the limit @xmath163 influences the reflection coefficient @xmath164 corresponding to wavepacket initial data appearing in the riemann - hilbert problem of inverse scattering .",
    "let @xmath165 have wavepacket form .",
    "we assume that the corresponding functions @xmath166 and @xmath167 defined by are such that @xmath168 and @xmath169 are schwartz - class functions , and that @xmath170 for all @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , this condition implies the existence of the limits @xmath171 letting @xmath172 , the relations then imply that @xmath173 where @xmath174\\,dy.\\ ] ]      we will require the jost matrix solutions for positive real @xmath52 and positive imaginary @xmath52 only .",
    "also , it is convenient to remove the rapidly oscillating exponential factors @xmath175 from the coefficient matrix @xmath57 in the differential equation , so we define related matrices @xmath176 for real @xmath104 by @xmath177 thus , the real @xmath104-axis corresponds to positive real @xmath52 ( for @xmath178 ) and positive imaginary @xmath52 ( for @xmath179 ) .",
    "the exponential prefactor ensures that the matrices @xmath176 satisfy a modification of the differential equation : @xmath180 in which the coefficient matrix @xmath181 is independent of @xmath17 and is defined by @xmath182 the matrices @xmath176 are then uniquely determined by the normalization conditions @xmath183      the wenzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) method of approximation can be applied to the differential equation in the asymptotic limit @xmath29 .",
    "the form of the wkb ansatz for a column - vector solution @xmath184 of is @xmath185 with the scalar exponent @xmath186 being independent of @xmath17 , and the vector @xmath187 being expanded in an asymptotic series in the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "inserting the ansatz into the differential equation and separating powers of @xmath17 results in a hierarchy of equations governing the exponent @xmath186 and the vector coefficients @xmath188 : at leading order we find @xmath189 and then at subsequent orders @xmath190 clearly , solving with @xmath191 nowhere vanishing requires that for each real @xmath12 and @xmath104 , the characteristic equation @xmath192 hold true .",
    "we must now distinguish two cases :    * the oscillatory case .",
    "this corresponds to open intervals of @xmath12 ( depending on @xmath99 ) in which the right - hand side of is strictly positive . in this case , @xmath193 will be taken to be one of two purely imaginary smooth functions of @xmath12 : we write @xmath194 where @xmath195 . * the exponential case .",
    "this corresponds to complementary open intervals of @xmath12 in which the right - hand side of is strictly negative . in this case , @xmath193 will be taken to be one of two purely real smooth functions of @xmath12 : we write @xmath196 where @xmath197 .    since @xmath166 vanishes for large @xmath198 , if @xmath199 then the oscillatory case holds for @xmath12 sufficiently negative , while if @xmath200 then the oscillatory case holds for @xmath12 sufficiently positive .",
    "the isolated values of @xmath12 ( depending on @xmath99 ) for which neither the oscillatory nor the exponential case applies because the right - hand side of vanishes are called _ turning points_. the wkb ansatz fails near each turning point .    in each oscillatory or exponential interval",
    "the derivative @xmath193 is therefore determined as a smooth function of @xmath12 , and then further requires that @xmath191 reside in the nullspace of the singular matrix @xmath201 . since the eigenvalues of @xmath202 are distinct , the matrix @xmath201 has rank one ; let @xmath203 denote a nonzero vector in the nullspace chosen arbitrarily , but depending smoothly on @xmath12 and @xmath104 .",
    "we then see that @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is a scalar factor with smooth dependence on @xmath12 and @xmath104 to be determined . inserting this expression on the right - hand side of for @xmath206 shows that @xmath207 will need to be determined as a solvability condition for @xmath208 . with @xmath207",
    "so chosen , one then obtains @xmath208 up to the addition of an arbitrary nullvector of @xmath201 , which may be written in the form @xmath209 involving a new scalar factor @xmath210 , and @xmath211 will then need to be chosen as a solvability condition for @xmath212 .",
    "the procedure continues in this systematic way for all @xmath213 .",
    "clearly , at each order there is produced one new integration constant ( independent of @xmath12 and @xmath17 , but @xmath104-dependence is allowed ) .",
    "but these constants may all be combined together , amounting to adding to @xmath187 a vector of the form @xmath214 where the scalar @xmath215 has an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath216 and @xmath217 denote the first and second columns , respectively , of the normalized matrix solutions @xmath218 of . since @xmath219 and @xmath220 are linearly independent solutions of it follows that there are scattering coefficients @xmath221 and @xmath222 such that the identity @xmath223 holds .",
    "note that @xmath224 for @xmath99 , where the scattering matrix @xmath67 is defined by .",

    "this situation is analogous to that occurring in one - dimensional quantum scattering problems , where a particle represented by a wave propagating to the right from @xmath227 encounters a potential barrier of sufficient height that it lacks the classical energy to penetrate . in the semiclassical limit @xmath5 ,",
    "the wave is nearly totally reflected , but an exponentially small fraction of the incoming wave is transmitted through quantum _ tunneling _ , and appears at @xmath228 as a small rightward propagating wave . the mathematical problem that arises there is also one of calculating the both the phase of the reflected wave and also the exponentially small magnitude of the transmitted wave , and so we refer to the calculation we are about to embark upon in the context of the mnls scattering problem a _",

    "now , the wkb method fails in a neighborhood of the turning point @xmath232 , and to pass through the turning point requires local analysis .",
    "however we will be able to proceed with the formal asymptotics at leading order simply by assuming that the connection problem is solved by constants that are independent of @xmath17 ( as is the case for simple turning points of the equation @xmath233 , for example ) . under this assumption ,",
    "the solution @xmath234 is well - approximated for small @xmath51 at @xmath12 just to the left of @xmath231 by a linear combination , with coefficients having magnitudes independent of @xmath17 , of the two wkb formulae valid in the exponential region @xmath226 .",
    "continuing this approximation to the left , away from the turning point @xmath231 , we observe that one of the two wkb formulae becomes exponentially large compared with the other ; therefore if @xmath12 is any point in the interior of the exponential region , @xmath234 is given by @xmath235 where @xmath236 and where @xmath237 is a smooth , @xmath17-independent eigenvector of @xmath202 with eigenvalue @xmath238 .",
    "to approximate @xmath221 and @xmath222 for small @xmath51 , we will now construct wkb approximations for the columns of @xmath239 valid in the oscillatory region @xmath240 .",

    "indeed , the fact that _ the very same @xmath425-function serves to simultaneously reduce both riemann - hilbert problems in the semiclassical limit _ implies immediately that , for example , when the ( essentially common , via the mapping ) solution to the hyperbolic nonlinear dispersionless systems ( for @xmath4 ) and forms shocks that are then dispersively regularized by the neglected term @xmath510 $ ] , the oscillations that subsequently develop _ will occupy exactly the same space - time region for both the mnls and defocusing nls problems_. a hint that this could be expected lies in the work of kuvshinov and lakhin @xcite who found a mapping similar to connecting the ( genus one ) whitham modulation equations for mnls and defocusing nls .",
    "the latter are derived via an averaging procedure to model four coupled fields describing the bulk properties of a modulated periodic traveling wave solution , a structure that resembles the wave pattern initially generated by dispersive regularization of shocks .",

    "the power of the observation that the same @xmath425-function controls both mnls with supersonic initial data and also defocusing nls in the semiclassical limit is that it makes the gurevich - pitaevskii procedure completely rigorous , and it also shows that similar results hold if shocks subsequently form in the solution of the whitham modulation equations : no matter how many breaking curves or caustics appear in the semiclassical dynamics to separate regions modeled by multiphase oscillations of various genera , these caustics will always be exactly the same for both mnls and defocusing nls .",

    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to present a comparison between the modified nonlinear schrdinger ( mnls ) equation and the focusing and defocusing variants of the ( unmodified ) nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation in the semiclassical limit . </S>",
    "<S> we describe aspects of the limiting dynamics and discuss how the nature of the dynamics is evident theoretically through inverse - scattering and noncommutative steepest descent methods . </S>",
    "<S> the main message is that , depending on initial data , the mnls equation can behave either like the defocusing nls equation , like the focusing nls equation ( in both cases the analogy is asymptotically accurate in the semiclassical limit when the nls equation is posed with appropriately modified initial data ) , or like an interesting mixture of the two . in the latter case , we identify a feature of the dynamics analogous to a sonic line in gas dynamics , a free boundary separating subsonic flow from supersonic flow . </S>"
