    "decelleration of molecules from supersonic nozzles  @xcite , filtering from an effusive source  @xcite and collisional techniques  @xcite are other methods which have been developed to produce samples of cold molecules .    the application of laser cooling techniques , which had tremendous impact on atomic and optical physics  @xcite , to molecules turned out to be inefficient so far . here , multiple scattering channels , due to the molecular ro - vibrational structure , are coupled by spontaneous emission , leading to uncontrolled heating of the system as an undesired side effect .",
    "even when heating can be suppressed , the resulting cooling time is long and may only be feasible for molecules which are confined in external traps for very long times  @xcite .",
    "proposals aimed at overcoming this problem have been suggested : sophisticated laser - cooling schemes , based on optical pumping the ro - vibrational states  @xcite and optimally modulated femtosecond excitation pulses  @xcite , achieve efficiencies which are still severely limited by spontaneous decay and its inherent long time duration .",
    "an alternative way to optically cooling external degrees of freedom of molecules was proposed and studied in  @xcite , and it makes use of the enhancement of stimulated photon emission into the cavity mode over the spontaneous decay .",
    "this mechanism was successfully applied for cooling the motion of atoms  @xcite . in a recent work  @xcite",
    ", we extended this idea and proposed to optically cool the external as well as the _ internal _ molecular degrees of freedom by using the coupling to a cavity . in the proposal the molecules are cooled by a raman process in which photons from an intense laser are scattered into the modes of a resonator by molecular dipole transition , thereby cooling the motion to the cavity linewidth and the ro - vibrational degrees of freedom to the ground state .",

    "the state @xmath178 has to be emptied but the logical target state @xmath179 is not accessible because the placzek - teller coefficient for the @xmath180 transition is zero .",
    "therefore the next accessible level , @xmath181 , is used , which results in an increase in @xmath140 . note that @xmath81 changes by @xmath182 and @xmath173 by @xmath156 and thus the variations in @xmath140 are larger than those in @xmath171 .",
    "the further progression for the laser induced transitions implies the alternation of two principles : transferring populations to the lower vibrational states like for the first cooling steps and cooling the rotational levels without vibrational heating .",
    "it turned out that for the further cooling steps it is more effective to first cool the rotational motion without changing the vibrational motion before transferring the population to the vibrational ground state .    in the end of the procedure @xmath171 and @xmath140",
    "converge to their respective minima @xmath183 and @xmath170 .",
    "the achieved rates for teh decrease of the expectation values are @xmath184hz and @xmath185hz .",
    "we have extensively discussed a scheme which allows to cool simultaneously the internal and external motion of molecules . in particular",
    ", we have detailed the rate equations at the basis of the simulations and the _ ab initio _ calculations of the molecular properties .",
    "special care was taken to use a realistic set of parameters .",
    "for these parameters , cooling of the external motion from 1k to a few @xmath186k can be accomplished in about a second , thus requiring the support of trapping technologies which are stable over these times  @xcite .",
    "we performed extensive calculations on the oh radical , and studied the cooling efficiency on the molecular properties by comparing the cooling efficiency of oh with the one of no .",
    "we see that , even if no has more populated rotational levels than oh at the same initial temperature , no can be cooled faster because of its higher polarizability .",
    "we notice that two properties of the polarizability play a different role in the cooling dynamics",
    ". in particular , the absolute value of the polarizability is responsible for the processes which cool the rotational excitations , while for vibrational cooling a finite slope of the polarizability as a function of the nuclear coordinate is essential .",
    "an interesting question is how the method performs for more complex molecules .",
    "an advantage of larger molecules is that states of even and odd @xmath81 can be coupled by raman processes , contrary to the case of linear molecules such as oh and no . on the other hand , with increasing complexity",
    ", the heating due to spontaneous raman scattering will become more important and must be compensated by a faster coupling to the environment with the help of a better cavity .",
    "additionally , the cooling process can be improved by optimizing the cooling sequence , a task which becomes increasingly difficult with more complex molecules and might require advanced optimization strategies like genetic algorithms @xcite . alternatively , our technique could be extended by combining vacuum - stimulated emission into the cavity with suitably designed raman pulses using optimal control techniques  @xcite .",
