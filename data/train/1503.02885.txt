    "i.e. , games where the board is the edge set of a given graph @xmath0 . in these games maker",
    "s aim is to create a graph consisting only of edges claimed by her that contains some predefined graph theoretic structure .",
    "for example , in the _",
    "@xmath2-clique game _",
    "( or sometimes abbreviated just as _ clique game _ when the value of @xmath2 is not crucial ) , maker s goal is to create a graph that contains a clique of order at least @xmath2 .",
    "we denote this game by @xmath16 .    here ,",
    "we study a variant of the clique game - the _ @xmath17-tournament game _ @xmath18 . in the @xmath17-tournament game , introduced by beck in  @xcite ,",
    "the goal graph is a tournament @xmath17 , a complete graph where each edge is directed .",
    "before the game starts , the tournament @xmath17 is fixed , and maker and breaker in turns claim edges , and maker also chooses one of the two possible _ orientations _ whenever she claims an edge . if her graph contains a copy of the given tournament @xmath17 by the end of the game , maker wins . otherwise , breaker does .",
    "* games on @xmath19 * very well - studied graph games are the ones where @xmath20 is the complete graph on @xmath21 vertices .",
    "erds and selfridge  @xcite initiated the study of the largest value of @xmath2 , @xmath22 , such that maker can win the @xmath23-clique game on @xmath4 and they were able to prove that @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , it turns out that in @xmath5 maker - breaker clique game on @xmath4 , maker has a strategy to occupy a clique of size @xmath25 , as shown by beck  @xcite , and therefore @xmath26 holds .",
    "the most interesting fact about this result is that it shows an intriguing relation between games and random graphs here , referred to as the _ random graph intuition _ or _",
    "probabilistic intuition_. to be precise , if both players played randomly throughout the game , then maker s graph would be distributed as a random graph with @xmath21 vertices and @xmath27 edges , which is well known to have clique size @xmath25 with high probability , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "that is , for most values of @xmath2 , a randomly played @xmath2-clique game on @xmath4 typically has the same winner as the deterministic game played by two intelligent players .    for the tournament game we can ask the same question , as initiated by beck  @xcite . motivated by the study of a randomly played @xmath17-tournament game , beck conjectured that the largest value of @xmath2 , @xmath28 , for which maker can win in the @xmath17-tournament game , for any tournament @xmath17 on ( at most ) @xmath2 vertices , is of size @xmath29 .",
    "however , as the first author together with gebauer and liebenau  @xcite showed , the truth is twice as large as the conjectured value , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "this , in particular , tells us two things .",
    "opposite to the clique game , the tournament game does not satisfy the random graph intuition mentioned above . secondly ,",
    "since the two values , @xmath23 and @xmath31 , are very close to each other , it does not make a big difference for maker whether she needs to build a graph with or without orientations in an unbiased game on @xmath4 .    in the following ,",
    "we want to find out whether we have similar observations in case we fix @xmath2 to be a constant , while changing either the bias of breaker or the board of the game .",
    "we start with biased games , in order to give more power to breaker .",
    "chvtal and erds  @xcite observed that maker - breaker games are _ bias monotone _ , meaning that if the @xmath3 game @xmath12 is a breaker s win , then the @xmath32 game is also a breaker s win . having this in mind",
    ", it thus becomes interesting to find the unique _ threshold bias _",
    "@xmath33 , which is the largest non - negative integer such that for every @xmath34 the @xmath3 game is a maker s win . for the @xmath2-clique game on @xmath4 ,",
    "bednarska and uczak  @xcite showed that the threshold bias is @xmath35 .",
    "naturally , one may wonder what happens with the tournament game , and whether in this case orientations of the edges make things more complicated for maker .",
    "we show that , for every tournament @xmath17 of order @xmath2 , the threshold bias of the @xmath17-tournament game @xmath36 is of the same order as in the @xmath2-clique game .",
    "[ biased_tournament ] let @xmath17 be a tournament on @xmath37 vertices , then the threshold bias for the @xmath17-tournament game on @xmath4 is @xmath38 .    * games on random boards .",
    "* another way to give breaker more power in positional games is to play unbiased graph games on a random graph , as introduced by stojakovi and szab  @xcite .",
    "the idea behind this approach is to make the board sparser before the game starts by randomly eliminating edges , so that some of the winning sets no longer exist .",
    "we look at the random graph model @xmath6 , which is obtained from the complete graph on @xmath21 vertices by removing each edge independently with probability @xmath39 .",
    "now , if an unbiased game @xmath40 is a maker s win , then we are curious about finding the _ threshold probability _ @xmath41 such that for @xmath42 the game @xmath43 is a maker s win asymptotically almost surely ( i.e.  with probability tending to @xmath44 as @xmath21 tends to infinity and abbreviated _ _ a.a.s .  _ _ in the rest of the paper ) , and for @xmath45 , the game @xmath43 is a.a.s .",
    "a breaker s win .",
    "when the @xmath2-clique game is played on @xmath6 , stojakovi and szab  @xcite showed that for @xmath46 , in the _ triangle _ game , @xmath47 and for @xmath48 , it holds that @xmath49 .",
    "mller and stojakovi  @xcite recently proved that for all @xmath48 the threshold probability is indeed @xmath50 .",
    "this again underlines an intriguing relation between games and random graphs , again referred to as the _ probabilistic intuition_. indeed , what we can observe here in case @xmath48 ( and also holds for several other natural graph games ) is that the threshold probability for maker s win in the @xmath5 game @xmath43 is of the same order of magnitude as the inverse of the threshold bias @xmath51 in the @xmath3 game @xmath40 . the triangle game is the only exception in this regard , as here maker a.a.s .  can win also for probabilities below the so - called critical probability @xmath52",
    "we show that the tournament game behaves similarly to the clique game when played on @xmath6 .",
    "so , even when played on a sparse graph @xmath6 , creating a graph with oriented edges is not much more difficult for maker than creating a graph without oriented edges . for the tournaments on @xmath2 vertices , @xmath48",
    ", we show the following , which also supports the probabilistic intuition .",
    "[ random_tournament ] let @xmath17 be a tournament on @xmath48 vertices , then the threshold probability for winning the @xmath17-tournament game on @xmath6 is @xmath53    so again , for @xmath48 , the outcome of the game does not depend much on the choice of the tournament @xmath17 on @xmath2 vertices , i.e. , on the way the edges of the goal tournament are oriented .",
    "however , our next theorem states that the tournament on three vertices behaves differently . in case @xmath17",
    "is the acyclic triangle @xmath54 , we obtain the same threshold probability as in the triangle game on @xmath6 .",
    "but , in case @xmath17 is the cyclic triangle @xmath55 , the threshold probability is closer to the critical probability @xmath52 .",
