    "on the past decade , an important field of interdisciplinary research has been developed based on new geometry concepts , namely `` the fractal '' geometry of nature , pioneered by benoit b. mandelbrot .",
    "the fractal geometry approximates well enough the naturally discovered disordered morphologies .",
    "for instance , the terminal part of the respiratory system of mammals , biological membranes , porous electrodes or catalysts , provide some characteristic examples@xmath1 .",
    "this implies a direct link to laplacian transfer , as one could mention that under ordinary conditions many familiar transport phenomena such as diffusion and heat conduction are described in the steady state by laplacian fields .",
    "the laplace equation is a linear equation , however the complexity of the problem is due to the geometrical irregularities of the boundaries . due to this fact ,",
    "an important number of studies on the distribution of laplacian fields around geometrically irregular - and eventually fractal - objects , have been justified@xmath2 .",
    "an old mathematical conjecture states that the laplacian field around a fractal object in two dimensions is itself of multifractal nature .",
    "this conjecture , after makarov s theorem is a mathematical fact . in a paper considered classical by now , b.b .",
    "mandelbrot explored for the first time in detail the laplacian field around a deterministic self - similar tree with his famous `` zebroide '' ( logarithmic ) representation@xmath3 .",
    "this work was the starting point for many authors who examined not only diffusion but also reaction - diffusion systems@xmath4 .",
    "also , specialists from mathematics ( harmonic analysis ) presented landmark studies on the distribution of harmonic measure around irregular boundaries .",
    "in particular , n.g .",
    "makarov proved a theorem stating that , whatever the shape of an irregular ( simply connected ) boundary in two dimensions might be , the active zone in which most of the flux generated by a laplacian field is concentrated , scales as a length@xmath5 .",
    "more importantly , this result holds exactly also for the `` mathematical '' fractal object . in the `` multifractal '' picture of the laplacian field",
    "this amounts to the equality of the first multifractal exponent ( the `` information dimension '' ) exactly to the value 1 .",
    "later on , b. sapoval proposed another interpretation of makarov s theorem on the grounds of `` information ensemble''@xmath6 .",
    "moreover , the active zone approximation tells us simply that some parts of an irregular surface are not really contributing , remaining `` passive '' , so that all thermodynamic properties can be estimated by considering only the `` active zone '' .",
    "the notion of the active zone received ample experimental support through electrochemistry experiments leading to its visualization with electrodeposition of copper@xmath7 ( optical absorption ) .",
    "according to the theorems mentioned above , for a laplacian field the active zone is always a good approximation .",
    "j. bourgain generalized this result in higher dimensions@xmath8 , but with a scaling exponent which depends on the dimensionality of space and is not necessarily an integer .",
    "continuing in the same lines , makarov and jones proved that the harmonic measure around some self - similar objects is multifractal . recently ,",
    "due mainly to work by sapoval s group , the problem of the multifractal spectrum around von koch s curve in two ( and then in three ) dimensions has been reconsidered on the grounds of hierarchical random walkers .",
    "important evidence that in three dimensions there is a nontrivial behavior of the information measure and a non - integer dimensionality equal to 2.007 is given by grebenkov et al.@xmath9 .",
    "in@xmath10 an alternative way to characterize the complexity of laplacian transport across irregular boundaries was proposed , based on irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "more specifically , the focus was set on the dissipation generated by the underlying process , as the irregularity of the boundary is increased .",
    "dissipation is measured by the entropy production , arguably the central quantity of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "the correct measure of complexity in this case is the entropy production per unit surface . in that study , as well as in@xmath11",
    ", attention was followed to the `` far field '' , that is in distances from the object which far exceed the length of the minimal irregularity of the surface ( the cut - off threshold ) .",
    "the main purpose of this work is firstly to revisit and generalize the results of@xmath10 and secondly to explore the behavior of the entropy production functional in the region of the `` near field '' , i.e. for distances between the membranes ( or electrodes ) which are smaller than the smallest detail of the prefractal iteration .",
    "it should also be noticed that the chart of the spatial distribution of the local entropy production for an increasingly irregular object in the near field does not exist anywhere in the literature to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "general considerations and detailed predictions for the active zone concept of an entirely diffusional field are presented in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .  iii the near domain predictions are examined in detail and in sec .",
    "iv these predictions are corroborated by numerical results obtained with finite elements and the chart of the local entropy production is portrayed . finally , in sec .",
    "v we draw the main conclusions and we discuss some more general issues .",
    "the simplest setting in which possible effects of complex geometry on entropy production can be identified is given in figure 1 . a concentration difference @xmath12",
    "is applied across the vertical boundaries of a cell , over a characteristic length @xmath13 .",
    "the cell obeys to zero flux boundary conditions along the horizontal direction @xmath14 , but there is now a geometric irregularity consisting of extending the horizontal characteristic length @xmath15 by a bump in the middle .    under the condition that @xmath16 satisfies in the steady state laplace equation @xmath17 it was shown@xmath10 that , on the grounds of nonequilibrium thermodynamics , the full expression for the entropy production reads @xmath18 while the variational functional which is extremal in the steady state , is given by @xmath19 before addressing the role of complex boundaries in the entropy production and the variational functional , we evaluate both @xmath16 and @xmath20 in the simple reference case of a two - dimensional box of height @xmath21 and length @xmath22 . the corresponding solution reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 = @xmath26 . in addition , the entropy production can be calculated exactly , yielding @xmath27 whereas the variational functional in this case reads @xmath28    for the setting of figure 1 , we have shown that in the `` far field '' the entropy production would keep the structure of eq.(5 ) as far as y - dependence goes , but the proportionality factor @xmath15 would be modulated based on makarov s theorem by an additional size - independent factor @xmath29 depending on geometry and on concentrations only @xmath30 under the same conditions the variational functional @xmath31 takes the form @xmath32 where now the constant @xmath33 depends on the geometry only .",
    "it should be emphasized however , that the arguments supporting the two equations above are mainly heuristic and based on the grounds of irreversible thermodynamics and dimensional analysis .",
    "it is perhaps interesting to notice that a formal proof of these equations is lacking both in terms of random walks on a lattice or in continuous time random walks .",
    "in addition to the above toy - model fractal geometry , one might study more complex objects , i.e. higher fractal generations . as an illustration we present in figure 2 the second and the fourth fractal iterations of the fractal generator of figure 1 .",
    "these irregular objects will play the role of counter - membranes in the sequel .     and @xmath34 , as well as the boundary conditions are indicated .",
    "for this fractal @xmath35,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we now focus on the case of mild diffusion .",
    "the purpose is to estimate the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath33 analytically in this limit . to this end",
    "we follow the so - called `` independent field approximation '' ( ifa ) .",
    "this is a coarse - graining argument based on compartmentalization of the full continuous space in which diffusion takes place into a finite number of properly selected non - overlapping and non - interacting rectangular regions .",
    "here , one can write down closed expressions for the entropy production and the variational functional assuming linear concentration profiles . the nonlinear dependence of the field in terms of the spatial coordinates arising from the irregularities of the boundaries is thus approximated by piecewise linear functions , entailing discontinuities of the equipotential lines at the boundaries between the cells .",
    "( here @xmath36 ) is successively reduced from left to right : a ) @xmath37 to b ) @xmath38 and c ) @xmath39.,scaledwidth=120.0% ]    let us illustrate how the ifa works for the first few fractal generations of the cell .",
    "we separate the cell into the three rectangles shown in figure 3 .",
    "accepting linear concentration profiles in each of the side parts ( @xmath40 ) and ( @xmath41 ) and applying eq.(5 ) with @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( i.e. setting @xmath44 ) one finds for the respective entropy production @xmath45 assuming furthermore a linear half penetration inside the pore ( that is , a linear concentration profile until the middle of the pore@xmath46 , thereby neglecting the remaining active zone ) the central region ( @xmath47 ) from eq.(5 ) with @xmath42 and @xmath48 reads @xmath49 thus , the total entropy production of the cell becomes @xmath50 applying now eqs.(5 ) and ( 6 ) for the whole cell with @xmath51 and @xmath43 we find ( remember that we deal here with mild diffusion , see eq.(7 ) ) that @xmath52 so that , for the first iteration ( figure 1 ) the coefficient @xmath33 is of the form @xmath53 similarly , for the second fractal iteration ( figure 2a ) we obtain @xmath54,\\ ] ] and for the third @xmath55,\\ ] ] where the superscript @xmath56 denotes the @xmath57 fractal iteration .",
    "proceeding in the same lines one can find and prove by induction that for the @xmath57 fractal iteration it holds @xmath58 the superscript ( @xmath59 ) denotes the corresponding fractal generation ( i.e. @xmath60 is for the first fractal generation , @xmath61 is for the second etc ) and @xmath62 indicates the respective inter - electrode distance .    pausing for a moment the analysis of @xmath63 , we investigate some features for the total entropy production of the fractal generations .",
    "especially , one can easily observe that for the first few fractal iterations the total entropy production is @xmath64 and @xmath65 where the superscript ( @xmath59 ) refers to the fractal iteration and the index @xmath66 corresponds to the geometrical structure that one can encounter in each fractal ( see also figure 3 ) .",
    "for example , the index @xmath40 ( or equivalently @xmath41 ) refers to the left ( right ) side part of the first fractal generation , while @xmath47 denotes the central region .",
    "similarly , the indices @xmath67 , @xmath68 refer to the central regions of the second and third fractal generations respectively etc .",
    "the above procedure implies that for the @xmath57 fractal iteration the total entropy production should be written as @xmath69 or in a more compact form @xmath70 here , the superscript ( @xmath59 ) denotes the corresponding fractal generation ( i.e. @xmath60 for the first fractal generation , @xmath61 for the second etc ) , whereas @xmath71 corresponds to each geometrical structure that appears in the corresponding fractal generation as explained above .",
    "moreover , we can find that the entropy production for each geometrical structure can be written as @xmath72 while the above polynomials are connected through the recurrence relations @xmath73 note also that the total entropy production for each fractal generation and geometrical structure can be written as @xmath74 coming back to the investigation of the coefficients @xmath63 we observe that the first derivative with respect to @xmath62 is positive @xmath75 implying that @xmath63 is an increasing function of @xmath62 .",
    "we should also observe here that for m= 1 , 2 , 3 one finds again the results of@xmath10 , ( geometries for the far field ) @xmath76 with a limiting value ( in the context of the ifa approximation ) @xmath77",
    "as also pointed out in the introduction , the `` near field '' is a situation not studied before in the literature .",
    "supposing that in the phenomenon there is no new physics , we can apply our real space renormalization scheme ( ifa ) in order to obtain predictions and compare them with the finite element predictions , considered here as reference values .",
    "more specifically , we can easily confirm that for @xmath78 the predictions of our real space renormalization scheme are @xmath79 approaching asymptotically the value ( in the framework of the ifa ) @xmath80 similarly , for m=0.1 the predictions of the renormalization are @xmath81 giving a limiting value in the context of the ifa approximation @xmath82 quite curiously , the renormalization procedure gives also a finite limit when @xmath83 , that is @xmath84 thus , we can conclude that @xmath85 , as it is expected from the cantor structure of the counter membrane . table i presents the values of @xmath86 predicted by the ifa for the first eight fractal iterations .",
    "it appears that @xmath86 take intermediate values of the order of 0.5 to 0.9 .",
    "a monotonic decay is observed for successive prefractal generations as the distance @xmath87 remains fixed .",
    "it is clear that when @xmath88 becomes very large ( @xmath89 ) @xmath90 tends to unity . as an empirical value coming now from our ifa approximation when @xmath91 the coefficient @xmath33 for the limiting fractal object approaches the value 0.51 ( see tables i , ii ) . on the other hand , for a given fractal iteration as @xmath88 increases the corresponding values of @xmath33 s",
    "are increasing .",
    "especially , it can be easily shown ( through the ifa ) that @xmath92 . from here",
    ", one can confirm that for large distances ( i.e. @xmath93 or equivalently @xmath89 ) the limiting value of @xmath63 of every fractal iteration is equal to unity , as the spatial distribution of the concentration becomes roughly uniform for large distances @xmath13 . indeed",
    ", table ii shows the limiting value of the coefficients @xmath90 as the distance @xmath88 is increased .",
    "more specifically , we observe a monotonic increase for the limiting value from 0.5 to unity as @xmath88 becomes very large ( of the order of ten , @xmath94 ) . as an illustration of the above discussion , figure 4 depicts the evolution of the coefficients @xmath95 ( predicted through the ifa ) with respect to different fractal iterations for various distances @xmath62 between the electrodes . in each case",
    "we observe a decay for increasing fractal iterations and a saturation of the corresponding coefficient ( after the sixth fractal generation ) .",
    ".in the table below , we present the values corresponding to the first few fractal generations of the coefficient @xmath95 for different distances from the membrane .",
    "we clearly observe a saturation after the seventh fractal iteration .",
    "it is concluded that the limiting value of @xmath96 for the final fractal object is a function of the fractal dimension @xmath97 of the object .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    another attempt to improve the above procedure is to insert the phenomenological ( numerical ) values for the coefficients @xmath98 , and actually obtain a `` renormalized '' value for the higher order coefficients e.g. @xmath99 etc , thus improving considerably the predictions of the theory . combining the empirical result for the first generation with a ifa half penetration argument inside the new pores for the second fractal generation , one can find @xmath100 while @xmath101    comparing now the above results we can find that @xmath102 differs from @xmath103 by only @xmath104 .",
    "similarly @xmath105 differs from @xmath106 by only @xmath107 and @xmath108 differs from @xmath109 by @xmath110 . in the same way",
    ", we can proceed with the remaining orders .",
    "also , one can try various renormalization schemes together with the theoretical arguments .",
    "the best results are obtained when one uses for the prediction of the coefficient of the @xmath111 fractal iteration @xmath112 only the empirical coefficients of the previous @xmath71 iteration and no theoretical argument at all .",
    "for instance , for the case of the second fractal iteration for distance @xmath113 one can find @xmath114 where the superscript `` fren '' stands for `` fully renormalized '' . here , the difference between @xmath115 and @xmath106 is of the order of @xmath116 .",
    "figures 5 - 12 present the spatial dependence of the entropy production for the first four fractal iterations , for @xmath117 , for the cases of strong ( @xmath118 ) and mild ( @xmath119 ) diffusion respectively .",
    "we observe that the behaviour of the local entropy production depends strongly from @xmath120 . in particular , for the case of strong diffusion ( see figures 5,7,9,11 )",
    "the appearance of a passive zone is observed irrespectively of the fractal generation .",
    "in contrast , for the case of mild diffusion the above statement breaks down , being indicated by the spreading of the local entropy production near the geometrical irregularities ( see figures 6,8,10,12 ) .    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    let us briefly recall here the argument which relates the coefficients @xmath29 and @xmath33 through the active zone concept for the case of mild diffusion , i.e. @xmath121 , @xmath122 , with @xmath123 . here , from eqs",
    "( 7 ) and ( 8) one can conclude that @xmath124 and @xmath125 while @xmath126 up to a factor of @xmath127 .",
    "the basic idea of this argument is that the profiles of the concentrations are essentially linear in space in the whole active volume and the nonlinearities are smoothly approximated .    in the opposite situation",
    ", we have the strong diffusion .",
    "one particular case of strong diffusion , which we study here in detail , is the case of the harmonic measure ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 ) .    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , while the distance between the electrodes is @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]     and distance between the electrodes @xmath117 .",
    "( computer units.),scaledwidth=90.0% ]    exactly in this case we obtain a visual interpretation of makarov s theorem .",
    "the measure is spreading on the surface of the working membrane almost uniformly in a length which roughly coincides with the diameter of the active membrane @xmath130 . in this case",
    ", makarov s theorem guarantees that at least for @xmath131 , @xmath132 holds ( see also tables iv - v ) .",
    "we thus obtain a very important result of our real space renormalization scheme : estimating the values of @xmath133 with the active zone approximation ( mandelbrot s argument ) we obtain also the value of @xmath29 in the whole range of @xmath25 , that is in all cases except from the case where @xmath134 .",
    "the above remarks indicate that the aforementioned ifa scheme is valid ( in the far and near domain ) at least for the first few fractal iterations for both strong and mild diffusion .",
    "indeed , it is remarkable that such a simple renormalization scheme gives accurate predictions for the first fractal generations and leads at least to qualitative results for higher iterations ( here up to the fourth ) . from our numerical calculations it turns out that the quality of the ifa prediction gets worse as the fractal generation increases and/or as the inter - electrode distance tends to zero ( see table vi ) .",
    "the basic reason behind this result is that the ifa is a coarse - graining approximation which neglects the fine microscopic details of the fractal objects .",
    "this is exactly the way to the passive zone approximation .",
    "thus , it is a challenging open question whether the above conclusions can be straightforwardly generalized for even higher fractal iterations , where the ifa approximation is expected to fail .",
    "this constitutes a heavy computational task especially for high enough fractals iterations .",
    "in particular , three questions remain to be checked : a ) to what extent the fully renormalized scheme is valid for higher fractal iterations , b ) whether the limiting value predicted by the ifa approximation holds as a qualitative argument and c ) the investigation of a better renormalization scheme that takes into account the respective correlations in the distribution of the harmonic measure especially for @xmath135 .",
    "the transport associated to molecular transfer of neutral particles from a diffusional field to an irregular membrane is examined from the standpoint of irreversible thermodynamics . combining non - equilibrium thermodynamics and an argument developed initially by mandelbrot et al.@xmath3 , and",
    "then by makarov et al.@xmath136 , one is led to probe and predict the entropy production and the variational functional of the transfer .",
    "detailed predictions are given for the whole range of distances from the far field to the near field corroborated by finite differences@xmath137 and finite elements calculations .",
    "the central idea of the active zone concept@xmath138 is that on the grounds of the laplacian transfer on a membrane , certain parts of the membrane remain passive and all thermodynamic properties of the membrane can be estimated with a very good approximation by the contribution of the `` active parts '' . in the context of the active zone introduced by spectroscopic impedance , a system with irregular boundaries possesses , in the makarov regime where the reactive system is `` almost entirely diffusive '' , the same impedance as a smaller system with regular boundary conditions .",
    "this @xmath139 `` apparent , spectroscopic length '' , is not the same as the quantity @xmath140 but the conclusion remains the same : an entirely diffusive system with irregular boundary conditions possesses the same entropy production as a system with smaller diameter and regular ( flat ) boundary conditions .",
    "this can be seen as an interpretation of makarov s theorem in terms of irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "do these remarks apply to the `` near field '' ? in the near field the original mandelbrot s argument boils down and the notion of spectroscopic impedance is relaxed .",
    "however , as it is shown here one does not expect `` new physics '' and irreversible thermodynamics is still valid .",
    "our remarks , are corroborated from the evaluation of the local entropy production around the von koch curve in the near field .    to be concrete , the entropy production and the variational functional of laplacian transfer for geometries associated with the first few fractal iterations leading eventually to a fractal generator ( von koch curve ) are studied .",
    "we first recover and recapitulate results for the far field .",
    "then , we turn to the case of the `` near field '' , a situation not studied before in the literature , for both strong and mild diffusion . detailed charts of the local entropy production around the first four iterations are given , and the global entropy production is investigated carefully . from these studies",
    "it is clear that the laplacian fields are in a sense a `` smooth measure '' around irregular objects .",
    "moreover , the analytic procedure which allows one to approximate the entropy production seems to be quite powerful and straightforward .",
    "although the spatial distribution of the local entropy production changes greatly from the mild to strong diffusion , the ifa analysis and the global entropy production obey the same rules in the far and in the near field .",
    "a fair evaluation of the ifa arguments implies that the difference between the predicted and the numerically obtained values increases with the fractal iterations .",
    "an interpretation of the above statement is that the ifa is a coarse - graining approximation which neglects the fine microscopic details of the fractal objects ( passive zone approximation ) .",
    "more specifically , in the framework of our ifa renormalized @xmath33 s for the first three generations differ by @xmath141 from the numerical reference values , and the fully renormalized b s coincide up to @xmath142 difference to the numerical values .",
    "as already pointed out , the generalization of these results for higher fractal iterations constitutes an interesting open problem .",
    "another question that arises from our investigation is whether the predicted by the ifa limiting value of the coefficient @xmath33 for high fractal generations holds at least qualitatively .",
    "this task requires heavy computations for the laplacian transfer of high fractal objects and has to be performed in the context of a supercomputer .",
    "finally , as we have also mentioned in the past , our predictions on such dissipation trends should be amenable to experimental testing in a suitably constructed diffusion cell .",

    "<S> the entropy production and the variational functional of a laplacian diffusional field around the first four fractal iterations of a linear self - similar tree ( von koch curve ) is studied analytically and detailed predictions are stated . in a next stage , these predictions are confronted with results from numerical resolution of the laplace equation by means of finite elements computations . after a brief review of the existing results , </S>",
    "<S> the range of distances near the geometric irregularity , the so - called `` near field '' , a situation never studied in the past , is treated exhaustively . </S>",
    "<S> we notice here that in the near field , the usual notion of the active zone approximation introduced by sapoval et al.@xmath0 is strictly inapplicable . </S>",
    "<S> the basic new result is that the validity of the active - zone approximation based on irreversible thermodynamics is confirmed in this limit , and this implies a new interpretation of this notion for laplacian diffusional fields . </S>",
