    "it is well established that when a granular material is externally excited ( rapid flow conditions ) the motion of grains resembles the random motion of atoms or molecules in an ordinary gas . in these conditions , kinetic theory together with numerical simulations are the best tools to describe the behavior of granular flows . however , in contrast to ordinary fluids , the collisions between grains are inelastic and so , one has to feed energy into the system to achieve a _",
    "steady _ non - equilibrium state .",
    "this can done either by driving through the boundaries , for example , shearing the system or vibrating its walls @xcite , or alternatively by bulk driving , as in air - fluidized beds @xcite . on the other hand , this way of supplying energy causes in most of the cases strong spatial gradients in the system . to avoid the difficulties associated with inhomogeneous states",
    ", it is quite usual in computer simulations to homogeneously heat the system by the action of an external driving force @xcite . borrowing a terminology often used in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics of ordinary fluids",
    "@xcite , this type of external forces are usually called `` thermostats '' .",
    "nevertheless , in spite of its practical importance , the understanding of the effect of the external driving force on the dynamical properties of the system ( such as the transport coefficients ) is still not completely understood @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent computer simulations @xcite have computed some transport coefficients by measuring the static and dynamical structure factors for shear and longitudinal modes in a driven granular fluid . given that the expressions for the transport coefficients were not known in this driven problem , the simulation data were compared with their corresponding elastic forms .",
    "thus , it would be desirable to provide simulators with the appropriate theoretical tools to work when studying problems in granular fluids driven by thermostats .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the transport coefficients of a dense driven granular gas of inelastic hard spheres in the framework of the enskog kinetic equation . as in the undriven case @xcite ,",
    "the transport coefficients are obtained by solving the enskog equation by means of the chapman - enskog expansion @xcite around a certain reference state @xmath0 ( zeroth - order approximation ) .",
    "while in the undriven case the distribution @xmath0 is chosen to be the local version of the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) , there is some flexibility in the choice of @xmath0 for a driven gas . for simplicity ,",
    "one possibility is to take a local thermostat such that the distribution @xmath0 is still stationary at any point of the system .",
    "this was the choice assumed in previous works @xcite to compute the transport coefficients of a heated granular gas . on the other hand , for _ general _ small deviations from the steady reference state ,",
    "the zeroth - order distribution @xmath0 is not in general a stationary distribution since the collisional cooling can not be compensated _ locally _ by the heat injected by the driving force .",
    "this fact introduces additional difficulties not present in previous studies @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will adopt this point of view and will consider this kind of thermostat that seems to be closer to the one used in computer simulations .",
    "the underlying motivation of such a study is twofold .",
    "on of the one hand , given that most of the computer simulations @xcite are performed by driving the fluid by means of a thermostat , it is important to know the effect of thermostat on the transport properties . in this sense",
    ", the question arises then as to whether , and if so to what extent , the conclusions drawn in previous works @xcite may be altered when the time - dependent distribution @xmath1 is considered in the chapman - enskog expansion instead of the steady distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also of interest to evaluate the transport coefficients in a situation where a direct comparison with computer simulations is more likely to occur . here , in the same way as the simulations carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have assumed that the fluid is driven by a stochastic bath with friction .",
    "this allows us to compare directly our theoretical predictions for the kinematic and longitudinal viscosities and the thermal diffusivity with those obtained from langevin dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "the derivation of macroscopic equations and associated transport coefficients from kinetic theory is limited in practice to weakly coupled systems ( dilute and moderately dense gases , ideal plasmas , anharmonic crystals ) . in the case of ordinary fluids ,",
    "the application of formally exact methods from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics has provided exact expressions for the transport coefficients known as green - kubo formula @xcite .",
    "green - kubo expressions are time integrals of equilibrium time correlation functions for the fluxes associated with conserved quantities .",
    "these expressions have the advantage of being formally exact and closely related to properties measured in the experiments . the derivation of the corresponding green - kubo formula for the transport coefficients of an _ undriven _ granular fluid has been a subject of great interest in the past few years @xcite . on the other hand , much less",
    "is known in the case of _ driven _ granular fluids .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only derivation of green - kubo formula for navier - stokes transport coefficients of a granular dilute gas heated by the stochastic thermostat has been recently carried out by garca de soria _ et al .",
    "starting from the boltzmann equation , these authors obtain explicit expressions for the transport coefficients as a function of the inelasticity and the spatial dimension . as will show below , in the low - density limit",

    "more explicitly , @xmath12 is given by @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a drag coefficient that defines the characteristic interaction time with the external bath , @xmath20 .",
    "as usual , the stochastic force @xmath21 is assumed to have the form of a gaussian white noise @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 unit matrix and @xmath25 represents the strength of the correlation . the forcing term in the enskog equation associated to @xmath21 is represented by a fokker - planck operator @xcite of the form @xmath26 .",
    "one of the advantages of using the model instead of other kind of thermostats is that the temperature of the thermostat @xmath17 ( different from the kinetic temperature of the fluid @xmath27 ) is always well defined .",

    "the results have been obtained within the framework of the ( inelastic ) enskog kinetic theory and they are expected to apply over a wide range of densities .",

    ", it would be convenient to provide to simulators with the corresponding expressions of the transport coefficients when the granular fluid is heated by a thermostat .",

    "in this situation , the enskog equation has been solved by means of the chapman - enskog method @xcite up to the first order in the spatial gradients .",
    "since these gradients have been assumed to be independent of the coefficient of restitution , although the corresponding hydrodynamic equations restrict their applicability to first order in gradients , the transport coefficients appearing in these equations hold a _ priori _ to arbitrary degree of dissipation .",
    "an important but subtle point is the generalization of the driving external forces ( which are mainly used in homogeneous situations ) to _ inhomogeneous _ states .",

    "although the above generalization is a matter of choice , it has important implications in the final expressions of the transport coefficients . for simplicity , in previous works on heated granular gases",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the external driving force has the same form as in the homogeneous case , except that their parameters are local quantities . as a consequence , the parameters of the force are chosen to impose a stationary temperature in the zeroth - order solution ( i.e. , @xmath213 ) . however , for general small perturbations around the steady homogeneous state , it is expected that the density and temperature are specified separately in the local reference state @xmath0 and so , the temperature can not be stationary at any point of the system ( i.e. , @xmath138 ) .",
    "this choice is more general than the previous one ( @xmath213 ) and has the advantage of a simpler implementation on computer simulations since the parameters of the driven external force are constant , even for inhomogeneous states .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the fact that @xmath138 gives rise to conceptual and practical difficulties not present in the case of the choice b. one of them is that the evaluation of the complete nonlinear dependence of the transport coefficients on dissipation requires in principle the analysis of the hydrodynamic behavior of the _ unsteady _ reference state .",
