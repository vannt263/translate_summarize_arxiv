    "the neutron diffraction data show  @xcite that under pressure of 0.6  gpa the transition from paraelectric into ferroelectric phase definitely is the first order .",
    "the high resolution x - ray diffraction temperature measurements at different pressures also clearly demonstrate the first order character of ferroelectric transition in sn@xmath0p@xmath0s@xmath1  crystals under pressure of 1.2  gpa where the transition temperature is lowered till 110  k  @xcite .    at sulfur by selenium substitution in sn@xmath0p@xmath0(se@xmath5s@xmath6)@xmath1  mixed crystals , the tcp on the phase diagram",
