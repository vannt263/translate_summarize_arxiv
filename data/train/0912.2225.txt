    "quantum mechanics in flat two dimensional space gives unusual results such as the quantum anticentrifugal force for waves with zero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "thus , it would be insightful to explore quantum mechanics in curved two dimensional space .",
    "of special interest are the minimal surfaces ( i.e. with zero mean curvature ) which play an important role in physics .",
    "besides the plane , the two other examples include the helicoid and the catenoid .",
    "an interesting question in the context of the three dimensional wormhole geometry @xcite in cosmology is whether information can propagate across the wormhole .",
    "we study the analog of this problem in two dimensions and first show that the two - dimensional wormhole is a catenoid .",
    "we then obtain the curvature induced quantum potential @xcite .",
    "the latter is an attractive geometric potential @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denote the two position - dependent principal curvatures of the surface , @xmath3 are the surface coordinates , and @xmath4 is the mass of the particle on the surface .",
    "a two - dimensional wormhole geometry can conceivably be realized in a bilayer of honeycomb lattices with radially arranged dislocations or in bilayer graphene @xcite , where the curvature induced suppression of local fermi energy can lead to the control of local electronic properties . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate the equivalence of a two - dimenasional wormhole and a catenoid . in sec .",
    "iii we obtain the effective curvature induced potential . in sec .",
    "iv we introduce a suitable coordinate system to study the bound states of the resulting schrdinger equation on the catenoid .",
    "we have previously studied bound states on the other minimal surface , namely the helicoid @xcite .",
    "note that a genus one helicoid also exists @xcite . finally , in sec . v we summarize our main conclusions and comment on the anticentrifugal force .",

    "thus the local radius @xmath9 and the metric is given by the following elements : @xmath10     a two - dimensional section ( catenoid ) of a three dimensional worm hole geometry with its axis along @xmath11 and the throat radius @xmath12 . ]",
    "we now show that a two dimensional wormhole geometry is equivalent to a catenoid ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in cylindrical coordinates",
    "@xmath13 a two - dimensional section of a wormhole is given by @xmath14 , \\ ] ] with @xmath15 .",
    "for the three dimensional wormhole the line element is given by the following expression@xcite : @xmath16 where the coordinates belong to the following intervals : @xmath17 $ ] , @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] and @xmath20 is the shape function of the wormhole [ in general @xmath21 and for @xmath22 represents the radius of the throat of the wormhole ] . here",
    "@xmath23 is a radial coordinate measuring proper radial distance ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are spherical polar coordinates . in this paper",
    "we will consider the case @xmath26 which represents an equatorial section of a three dimensional wormhole ( at constant time ) .",
    "for this section we thus get the following line element : @xmath27 which is precisely equivalent to the line element of a catenoid ( since @xmath28 ) @xmath29    note that if we consider any other section of the three dimensional wormhole , say for @xmath30 the line element will change to : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and obviously @xmath33 $ ] . for the catenoid",
    "this will mean only a rescaling of the radius of the catenoid from @xmath12 to @xmath34 .",
    "the line element eq .",
    "( 6 ) corresponds to a catenoid with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus all @xmath24-sections of the 3d - wormhole represent a catenoid with radius @xmath34 .",
    "the catenoid with the biggest radius corresponds to the equatorial section @xmath37 and with zero radius to @xmath38 .",
    "returning to the catenoid and focusing on the @xmath39 coordinates ( instead of @xmath40 , @xmath25 ) , the line element is given by @xmath41 with the principal curvatures @xmath42 this implies that the mean curvature @xmath43 ( i.e. a minimal surface ) and the gaussian curvature @xmath44 .",
    "if a particle is confined to move on a curved surface ( with finite thickness ) and the thickness is allowed to go to zero , then there will appear an effective potential in the schrdinger equation , known as the da costa potential @xcite .",
    "( for a flat surface the potential is zero ) .",
    "the corresponding curvature induced da costa potential for a catenoid is @xmath45    note that for @xmath46 the geometric potential becomes very deep and localized at the origin .",
    "the relevant schrdinger equation is @xmath47 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_0r^2}{\\rm sech}^4(z / r)\\psi = e\\psi , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or simplifying    @xmath48    using the cylindrical symmetry along the @xmath11-axis , we set @xmath49 and we get the following equation for @xmath50 : @xmath51    defining dimensionless length @xmath52 and energy @xmath53 we get the following effective schrdinger equation : @xmath54 where the geometric potential now reads : @xmath55 - { \\rm sech}^2(\\zeta ) .\\ ] ] this potential for @xmath56 bears some similarity to the corresponding geometric potential for the three dimensional wormhole @xcite .",
    "note that in the ground state ( @xmath57 , called also a _ critically bound state _",
    "@xcite ) the above potential becomes the reflectionless bargmann s potential @xcite and the schrdinger equation becomes the hypergeometric equation with the ground state wavefunction ( or the goldstone mode ) given by @xmath58 .",
    "this result is remarkable in that the minimal surface of catenoid enables complete transmission across it for a quantum particle .",
    "this does not seem to be the case for a three dimensional wormhole .",
    "for nonzero and positive @xmath59 the above potential is an inverted double well potential shown in fig .",
    "2 .     the inverted double well potential @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 . ]",
    "let us consider eq . ( 13 ) in more detail .",
    "we see that @xmath63 the behavior of the potential at infinity is strange since the physical geometry in the catenoid in these regions approaches the usual euclidean one .",
    "this feature can be traced to the coordinates used since the proper length per unit in the @xmath64 direction diverges when @xmath65 .",
    "this can be remedied by introducing another set of coordinates on the catenoid .",
    "quantum theory in curved spaces is generally a challenge since the theory is not generally covariant .",
    "classical quantum theory is not even lorentz invariant .",
    "this puts a severe constraint on the coordinate system in which one wishes to describe the physics in order to be able to extract the physical content of the theory .",
    "this challenge was even central in the early days of general relativity theory itself in connection with the physical interpretation of the schwartzshild metric , e.g. just like as in general relativity theory one is usually safe concerning the physical interpretation as well as the definitions of physical quantities when the manifold in question is asymptotically minkowski ( euclidean ) . in such asymptotic regions we expect on physical grounds to rederive the usual flat space physical results .",
    "the asymptotic properties thus in some sense anchor the curved region and its physics to reality as we know it .",
    "the catenoid is an asymptotic euclidean object , thus making this manifold a space anchored to  reality \" .",
    "considering the 2d schrdinger equation in the plane in polar coordinates we get the bessel equation .",
    "clearly , the boundary condition at the origin is suspect here .",
    "however , in our case we can as a first approximation consider a deformation of the plane in a region around the origin .",
    "in the deformed region the schrdinger equation will generally be very complicated but the solutions of it must nevertheless be matched to the bessel functions which survive sufficiently far from the deformed region .",
    "this reasoning goes _ ad verbum _ through also on the catenoid even though we here , in addition to curvature corrections , also have a topology change when compared to the plane .",
    "hence , we should seek coordinates on the catenoid such that the schrdinger equation gives rise to the bessel equation in the asymptotic region on the catenoid .",
    "the coordinates should in particular result in a metric which is reminiscent of polar coordinates at infinity .",
    "it is possible to find such coordinates if one covers the entire manifold with two coordinate patches .",
    "one patch covers the region @xmath66 and the other one @xmath67 .",
    "in the upper part we choose @xmath68 in the lower part we correspondingly choose @xmath69 clearly @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "the invariant line - element can then be written as @xmath72 in the limit @xmath73 the metric reduces to @xmath74 hence , the asymptotic form of this metric is very similar to the usual polar coordinates .",
    "clearly , these new coordinates should be well suited to explore the physical states of a quantum particle on the catenoid .",
    "let us now consider the schrdinger equation . in terms of the new coordinates we have in particular that @xmath75 this gives rise to identical expressions for the schrdinger equation in the two patches . in the upper patch",
    "the equation is explicitly given by @xmath76\\phi = 0\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , letting @xmath77 we get the bessel equation , which is well behaved at infinity .",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation , and assuming a well defined energy @xmath78 eigenvalue problem , is formally given by @xmath79 hence , we have that @xmath80\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the asymptotic region we find that @xmath81 we have plotted the potential for @xmath82 and @xmath83 in fig .",
    "3 .     the potential @xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath83 . ]    clearly , the constant part of the potential can be renormalized to zero without any physical consequences .",
    "hence , the renormalized potential @xmath86 can be taken to be @xmath87\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consider @xmath88 and the case when the energy is set to unity .",
    "then the physical quantum states fall into four different categories . in the @xmath89-channel ( @xmath90 )",
    "the potential becomes negative sufficiently close to the origin .",
    "when @xmath61 the same patterns emerge but with a much faster fall off of the potential with increasing coordinate distance from the origin than in the @xmath89-channel . when @xmath91 the potential is everywhere positive definite",
    ". higher angular momentum modes will give rise to bound states at a distance from the origin and at a distance in the direction of increasing radial coordinate .",
    "in general , if it is possible to redefine @xmath92 in eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) then the equation for @xmath93 would correspond to the double sinh - gordon potential which is quasi - exactly solvable @xcite , i.e. for specific values of @xmath59 and @xmath94 exact solutions can be obtained .",
    "we demonstrated that a two dimensional equatorial ( @xmath95 or any other section of a wormhole is equivalent to the minimal surface of a catenoid .",
    "we then showed that the curvature induced da costa quantum potential @xcite allows for a critically bound state @xmath96 .",
    "this leads to a reflectionless transmission of a quantum particle across the catenoid ( or a 2d wormhole ) . by introducing an appropriate coordinate system we were able to obtain bound states for different angular momentum channels .",
    "it is interesting to note that the potential is attractive at the origin @xmath97 for @xmath90 and @xmath61 ( anticentrifugal potential with bound states ) .",
    "in contrast , in the plane the anticentrifugal potential is present only for @xmath90 but an additional @xmath98-function potential is needed at the origin in order to introduce the missing length scale in the plane@xcite .",
    "we note that a radial array of dislocations in a bilayer of honeycomb lattices or a suitably bent bilayer graphene sheet with a neck @xcite may provide a physical realization for our findings .",
    "another experimental means of measuring the potential ( eq .",
    "14 ) is to construct nanoscale waveguides in a catenoid shape ."
