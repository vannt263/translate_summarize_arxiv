    "they lay the foundation of many cosmological models , describing the formation of present barionic matter from initial plasma .",
    "the problem with kinetic approach is that at the plank times , @xmath0 , the era of quantum gravity , the riemann space - time itself did not exist , so neither the boltzmann kinetic equation of the form @xmath1 ,   \\label{bke}\\ ] ] nor its relativistic generalisation is valid for that stage .    the situation with the quantum mechanical description of the early universe is a little better . in quantum mechanics",
    "the evolution of quantum system is described as the evolution of the density operator @xmath2 obeying the von neumann equation @xmath3   \\label{me},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the hamiltonian of the system . for the evolution equation it does not mean whether the spacetime is continuous , differentiable , archimedian .",
    "what is significant is the evolution : the existence of time @xmath5 and the dependence of the state on @xmath5 just means the evolution ; if there is no evolution there is no change in quantum state .",
    "it is important for the kinetic approach that the evolution equation for the classical distribution function in phase space @xmath6 should be obtained as the classical limit @xmath7 of a more fundamental quantum equation at the assumption of the existence of classical trajectory @xmath8 for each particle .",
    "this is called the _",
    "macroscopic limit_.    in a purely quantum case , when @xmath9 can not be treated as a small parameter , it is impossible to assign any trajectory @xmath10 to a given particle .",
    "this is the case for dense plasma , lasers , microelectronics this is also the case for quantum gravity .",
    "the present paper considers the effect of general causality assumptions on the evolution of the density operator and the kinetic equation , resulting from this evolution in macroscopic limit .",
    "the general causality assumptions , discussed in @xcite , are required for the construction of quantum field theory on a category space , which is not a manifold , when continuity and differentiability are not provided .",
    "this is the case for the quantum gravity era of the early universe , and hence before the light - cone causality of minkovskian space have been set by big bang a more general causality assumptions should hold . in the limit of classical non relativistic gas the general theory drives us back to known results for the boltzmann equation and the klimontovich method for molecular gases , but",
    "ultimately leads to irreversibility if the internal degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in _ section",
    "[ dens : sec ] _ we remind the links between quantum description of hierarchic systems and causality . in _",
    "section [ kin : sec ] _ a semi - quantum kinetic equation for a gas of structured particles is constructed .",
    "_ section [ osc : sec ] _ presents a toy model of a system of hierarchic quantum oscillators and imposes the operator ordering on this system . in _ conclusion",
    "_ we summarize the basic ideas of our approach .",
    "strictly speaking the von neumann equation holds only for _ closed _ systems  but the only system which is absolutely closed is the universe as a whole .",
    "therefore there should be some methods to treat the system of our interest as _ approximately _ closed , when its interaction with the rest of the universe can be neglected , or treated perturbatively . in this case",
    "the state vector of the whole universe can be casted in a form @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the states of the system , @xmath13 are the states of its _ environment _ , the rest part of the universe . to get a tractable model the states of the environment",
    "are assumed to be mutually orthogonal @xmath14 in view of this assumption the matrix elements of the density operator of the whole universe @xmath15 in the basis of the states of system @xmath16 are @xmath17 this means the probabilities of different states of a quantum system @xmath18 are obtained by averaging over all states of its environment .",
    "the mean value of arbitrary physical observable @xmath19 for such system is equal to the trace of the product @xmath20 with respect to the states of the system @xmath16 : @xmath21    since it is impossible to account for all degrees of freedom of the environment , what is done in practice is different from the summation with orthonormality condition .",
    "namely , considering a diluted gas of diatomic molecules in coordinate representation @xcite , one uses the wigner function @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the center of mass coordinate of the molecule , @xmath24 is its total momentum ; @xmath25 is the internal degree of freedom  the relative displacement of atoms in the molecule ; @xmath26 is the density matrix of diatomic molecule in coordinate representation .    in the language of state vectors",
    "the wigner function formalism corresponds to the change of basis for the density operator to a hierarchic one @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the next to the studied system @xmath29 hierarchy level .",
    "( say , in the case of diatomic gas @xmath30 denotes the state vector of molecule , with @xmath31 being the state of atom in this molecule . ) the density matrix for the system @xmath29 can be casted in the form @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is given by .",
    "the hierarchic representation poses the problem of ordering the operators acting at different hierarchy levels .",
    "the operator ordering rule `` the coarse acts the first '' was suggested by the author @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to general cosmological idea of cascade process of the universe origin from vacuum : @xmath34        at present stage of the universe evolution the hierarchy level and the number of constituents are very large @xmath35 is expected to be of order of the dirac - eddington number @xmath36 , or so , and we observe continuous universe @xcite .",
    "this implies two types of causality : ( _ i _ ) the vertical causality @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is a part of @xmath39 ) ; ( _ ii _ ) the horizontal causality @xmath40 ( @xmath38 precedes @xmath39 ) ; in fig .",
    "[ casc : pic ] @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , two types of _ operator ordering _ are required to meet two types of partial order .",
    "the approach with two types of causality relations is a generalization of common light - cone causality of the minkovsky space with @xmath42-ordering relation for the operators on more general spaces .",
    "it perfectly meets the needs of quantum gravity level cosmological models , when the the manifold structure is not provided @xcite .",
    "the details of this topological approach , known as _ region causality _ , can be found in @xcite .",
    "what region causality says is quite natural not only for quantum gravity , but also for molecular physics : no experiment can detect a causal effect in a _ point _ ",
    "what is really observed is an effect in a _ region _ , the size of which is restricted , at best , by the heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath43 .",
    "so , in accordance to @xcite we adopt two types of causality : @xmath44 the latter corresponds to the light - cone causality ; the former , supplied with the operator ordering `` the coarse acts first '' , just stands for the fact that it is impossible to change the state of the part without changing the state of the whole .",
    "it is important for kinetic theory that the bogolubov causality relations for the scattering matrix @xcite @xmath45}{\\delta g(y ) } s^\\hc [ g ] \\right]=0 ,",
    "\\quad x \\stackrel{<}{\\sim } y , \\label{bgc}\\ ] ] originally formulated for the light - cone causality",
    " @xmath46 means @xmath47 and @xmath48 means the interval between the events @xmath49 and @xmath50 is space - like interval  without significant changes are generalized to the vertical causality as well .",
    "this can be easily seen by introducing @xmath51-adic coordinate @xmath52 on the branching tree .",
    "the research in quantum gravity have stimulated the extension of the @xmath53-matrix formalism to non - archimedian numeric fields , namely to the field of @xmath51-adic numbers @xcite .",
    "hence the bogolubov causality relation can be given for the quantum fields depending on @xmath51-adic arguments , and therefore the fields defined on the vertexes of @xmath51-adic tree can be ordered in analogy to the @xmath42-ordering causality .",
    "in @xmath51-adic metric the partial order is given by @xmath51-adic metric @xmath54 :    @xmath55  vertical ordering ;    if @xmath56 then @xmath49 and @xmath50 are ordered by the first nonzero coefficients  this is horizontal ordering in the ring of natural numbers @xcite .",
    "so , if @xmath57 in the bogolubov causality relation is defined on the branching tree . a toy - model of such field theory is presented in @xcite .    in topology",
    "the causality of regions is axiomatising by means of partial order relations in a form of causal sets @xcite .",
    "the causality at quantum gravity level  we would say before the big bang  will be the _ region causality _ with two causality relations @xmath58 and @xmath59 , that is called a causal site .",
    "the axiomatics of causal site given in @xcite is presented in appendix .    in a ( pseudo- )",
    "euclidean space the structure of the causal sites implies causal paths and the geodesic coinciding with light - cone causality .",
    "however at quantum gravity level , when the archimedean axiom does not hold , the vertical causality relation @xmath60 is expected to play the important role .",
    "we do not know the concrete scheme of the present universe formation from initial object , but without loss of generality we can assume that at initial time @xmath61 there was only one initial object @xmath62 . at the next instant of time @xmath5 it branched into @xmath63 parts , each of those continued further branching in a tree - like matter ",
    "therefore a hierarchic structure have been formed @xcite .",
    "this hierarchic structure endowed with certain system of relations between its elements has formed our space - time .",
    "the axiomatics of causal site is rather general and should be applied not only at quantum gravity level , but also for quantum systems of present life , such as molecular gases . to see this",
    ", we have to cast the density operator in a hierarchic basis .",
    "let us consider a hierarchic system @xmath64 consisting of two parts @xmath65 and @xmath66 , each of those consists of its own two parts , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ h3:pic ] .        for definiteness ,",
    "let us consider the particle `` i '' of the finest hierarchy level of the system above .",
    "the mean value of an observable @xmath19 related to @xmath18 can be evaluated in two different ways :    1 .   with the density matrix",
    "averaged over all states of @xmath69 : @xmath70 2 .   with the density matrix averaged over the states of @xmath65  the `` parent '' of @xmath18 : @xmath71",
    "the former case is a standard way of the partial density matrix for a multi - particle system @xcite , the latter is presented in @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the state vectors are represented in a tree - like form @xmath72 with index @xmath64 being dropped as omnipresent .    to provide the equivalence of these two approaches the effect of the other particles @xmath73 on the parts of @xmath65 , on @xmath18,@xmath69 , should exist only via change the state of @xmath65 .",
    "this the effect of the whole to its parts . in thermodynamics",
    "it corresponds to adiabatic insulation of the system @xmath65 , when the energy can be transferred to the system as a whole , but not to its internal degrees of freedom .",
    "let us consider a simple example . a homogeneous gas of molecules with the distribution function @xmath74 .",
    "the molecules can transfer part of their kinetic energy to their internal degrees of freedom , represented by quantum harmonic oscillators .",
    "the molecules do not interact beyond the interaction zone @xmath75 , with @xmath76 being the typical radius of the molecule .",
    "this approximation is valid since the energy of oscillatory degrees of freedom is much bigger than that of rotational degrees of freedom , but much less than the energy of electron transitions : @xmath77 so , in a certain range of energies , corresponding to infrared radiation energy , the kinetic energy of molecules is transferred into oscillatory degrees of freedom by means of binary collisions between molecules    the energy levels of quantum harmonic oscillator , representing the oscillatory degrees of freedom of the molecules , are @xmath78 the state of each molecule in this semi - quantum approximation is given by three variables @xmath79  position , momentum and excitation number .",
    "the rotations are ignored in this approximation .",
    "the gas is assumed to be homogeneous ( to be in a constant force field ) , therefore the total momentum is conserved in each binary collision , the energy can be transferred to the internal degrees of freedom only by quanta @xmath80 , but not in a continuous manner . to make the model consistent we assume the oscillator degrees of freedom to be in thermodynamic equilibrium with radiation at temperature @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account that in quantum description the density matrix can be casted in terms of the wigner functions , we can derive the kinetic equation for the probability density functions @xmath81 with the initial condition @xmath82 .",
    "the causality condition `` the coarse acts first '' will manifest itself in the restriction that the energy transfer from the macroscopic @xmath83 degrees of freedom to the microscopic @xmath84 is allowed , while inverse is not : the excess of energy is relaxed into radiation only .",
    "let us denote the momenta of two colliding molecules ( in centre mass system ) before the collision as @xmath24 and @xmath85 , and @xmath86 and @xmath87 after collision , respectively .",
    "the momentum and energy conservation laws for binary collision imply @xmath88 as a simplest model the assume the probability of transfer of @xmath89 quanta of energy into internal degrees of freedom is proportional to the number of means @xmath90 this energy can be distributed between two oscillators : @xmath91 the sums in should be bounded by some reasonable integer @xmath92 , which guaranties the condition holds .",
