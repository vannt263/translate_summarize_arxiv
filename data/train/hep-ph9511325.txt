    "in the development of our understanding of the hadron production mechanism , the inclusive one - particle production by electron - positron annihilation plays the same role as the deeply inelastic scattering does in our learning of the nucleon structures .",
    "experimentally , a number of electron - positron colliders have been operated and will be constructed at various center of mass energies . on the theoretical side ,",
    "a series of parton fragmentation functions have been identified by jaffe and ji @xcite , which characterize the information about the inclusive hadron production .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to explore the possibility to measure them , expecially those spin - dependent ones , by the inclusive one - particle production in electron - positron annihilation . to study spin physics related to the inclusive spin - half baryon production , it is usually needed to monitor the polarization of the produced particles .",
    "if we are restricted with the inclusive hyperon production , it is quite feasible to measure the polarization of the produced particles .",
    "in fact , a series of experiments have already been done at fermilab measuring the polarization of the inclusive hyperons in fixed - target experiments @xcite .",
    "we also note that some preliminary results @xcite on the measurement of the @xmath8 polarization at cern lep have been existent as well . because what can be accessed directly by experiments are structure functions , we explore in this paper the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , two spin - dependent structure functions for the inclusive spin - half baryon production by electron - positron annihilation , and the quark fragmentation functions defined by jaffe and ji .    without loss of any generalities",
    ", we consider the inclusive @xmath8 hyperon production for among the hyperons the @xmath8 particle is of the largest production cross section and its polarization is the easiest to measure .",
    "the advantages of measuring the polarization of the inclusive @xmath8 hyperon are also realized by several groups of authors in different cases . among others ,",
    "burkardt and jaffe @xcite investigated the possibility to measure the @xmath9 fragmentation functions at lep , and chen _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite discussed the more complicated semi - inclusive process @xmath10 .    for simplicity",
    ", we work in the energy region not too high so that only the photon channel needs to be considered . then , all the information about the hyperon production is entailed by the photon fragmentation tensor , which is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the summation over all the possible final states that contain the inclusive @xmath8 hyperon . throughout the work ,",
    "we normalize the spin vector in such a way that @xmath13 for a pure state .",
    "the electromagnetic current is defined as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the quark flavor index and @xmath16 being the electric charge of the quark in unit of the electron charge . in our presentation",
    ", we will suppress the flavor index whenever possible .",
    "subjected to the gauge invariance , hermiticity and parity conservation , @xmath17 assumes the following general lorentz decomposition @xcite : @xmath18 \\nonumber   \\\\ & & + i m \\varepsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\sigma}q^\\lambda s^\\sigma \\frac{\\hat g_1(z_b , q^2)}{p\\cdot q } + i m \\varepsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\sigma}q^\\lambda ( s^\\sigma -\\frac{s\\cdot q}{p\\cdot q } p^\\sigma ) \\frac{\\hat g_2(z_b , q^2 ) } { p\\cdot q } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + m \\left[(p_\\mu-\\displaystyle\\frac{p\\cdot q}{q^2 } q_\\mu)\\varepsilon_{\\nu \\rho\\tau\\eta}p^\\rho q^\\tau s^\\eta + ( p_\\nu-\\displaystyle\\frac{p\\cdot q}{q^2}q_\\nu ) \\varepsilon_{\\mu",
    "\\rho\\tau\\eta}p^\\rho q^\\tau s^\\eta \\right ] \\frac{\\tilde f ( z_b , q^2)}{(p\\cdot q)^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the mass of the @xmath8 hyperon , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath24 are the scaling structure functions .",
    "it should be noted that due to the final - state interactions , the time reversal invariance can not exert any constraints on the lorentz decomposition of @xmath25 .",
    "obviously , there exists one - to - one correspondence between @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 , on the one hand , and four structure functions @xmath26 ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the deeply inelastic scattering , on the other hand . @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath23 have been vastly discussed in the literature @xcite , so we will simply ignore them in our discussion .",
    "as for the structure function @xmath24 , which arises from the final - state interaction , we will not address it , either , to avoid dispersing the reader s sight",
    ". our attention will be focused on @xmath0 and @xmath1 so that our results can be compared with their counterparts in the deeply inelastic scattering case @xcite .",
    "we establish our coordinate system by letting the @xmath30 axis be along the outgoing direction of the inclusive hyperon and the @xmath31@xmath30 plane in the production plane .",
    "we adopt the light - cone coordinates and parameterize the @xmath8 momentum as @xmath32 where @xmath33 @xmath34 with @xmath35 being the magnitude of the @xmath8 momentum .",
    "we will work in the frame in which @xmath35 has a large value",
    ". obviously , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are light - like and they satisfy @xmath38 .",
    "we feel it desirable to present a naive parton model approach to @xmath0 and @xmath1 , since the corresponding results can supply us with a benchmark for comparison . in the naive parton model",
    ", the fragmented hadrons will be completely collinear to their parent quark parton , with no transverse momentum effects .",
    "correspondingly , we need to assign a mass @xmath39 to the quark of flavor @xmath15 , where @xmath40 is the momentum fraction of the quark carried by the inclusive @xmath8 particle .",
    "@xmath41 can be obtained from the convolution of the underlying tensor @xmath42 for photon fragmentation into a quark - antiquark pair with the @xmath8 multiplicity distribution @xmath43 in the jet initiated by the quark of flavor @xmath15 and spin four - vector @xmath44 : @xmath45 by analogy with the well - known leptonic tensor , we know @xmath46.\\ ] ] therefore , we have the following results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the @xmath8 number density difference with spin parallel and antiparallel to the quark spin in the @xmath15-flavored quark jet . in the naive parton model ,",
    "if one boosts into the quark rest frame , all its fragmenting products will be at rest , too .",
    "hence , @xmath50 does not depend on the spin quantization direction @xcite .",
    "in the qcd field theory approach , the photon fragmentation tensor is composed of the contributions of an infinite series of the so - called cut feynman diagrams .",
    "the cut diagram is formed by piecing together the feynman diagram of one amplitude with the complex conjugate of another one with the same initial and final states . owing to lack of the methods to treat nonperturbative interactions , one usually adopt the strategy to factorize @xcite the hadron - involved process into short- and long - distance parts .",
    "the former can be calculated perturbatively whereas the latter can be measured experimentally .",
    "in such a factorization approach , qcd long - distance interactions are conventionally represented by blobs in the cut diagram . in general , these cut diagrams begin to contribute at the different powers of the hard scattering scale . if a physical quantity goes like @xmath51 or begins to make contributions at @xmath52 , it is referred to as being twist-@xmath53 . according to qiu and sterman @xcite",
    ", the twist at which a cut diagram begins to contribute is controlled by the number of @xmath54 parton lines that attach to the long - distance interaction blobs .",
    "now it is well known that some potentially power - suppressed twist - three spin asymmetries are relatively large , so in this paper we will work up to the twist - three level , i.e. , to the first nonleading power .",
    "in addition , we work in the light - cone gauge specified by @xmath55 .",
    "correspondingly , the cut diagrams shown in figs . 1 , and 2 consist of our subjects .",
    "we begin with the case in which the inclusive @xmath8 is of plus helicity . in this case",
    ", the leading spin dependence of @xmath41 comes about at twist two , while its next - to - leading spin dependence at twist four . to protrude the main physics",
    ", we work at leading twist and accordingly only the lowest - order diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 gets into work . as a result , @xmath56 ,   \\label{t2}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 and @xmath58 stands for making traces in the dirac and color spaces , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the dirac indices .",
    "the color summation is implicit in our parton fragmentation matrices , so there is a color factor @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) .",
    "since we work in the physical gauge , the gauge linkages of the form @xmath63 $ ] are identical to unity and hence suppressed in our parton fragmentation matrices .",
    "since high - energy reactions are light - cone dominant , the most efficient way to extract the leading contributions from each diagram is to make an expansion about the components of the parton momenta that are collinear to the corresponding hadron momentum .",
    "after that , one must further decouple the discrete indices between the long - distance matrices and the associated short - distance parts . for completing these tasks",
    ", one can employ the collinear technique developed by ellis , furmanski and petonzio @xcite .",
    "let us parameterize the quark momentum as @xmath64 then , the collinear expansion for the lowest - order diagram reads @xmath65 since working at twist two , here we need only to consider the the contributions associated with the leading term . as a result , we obtain @xmath66,\\ ] ] with @xmath67 since the color index has been decoupled in eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) , now the only task for us is to decouple the dirac indices between the expanded hard - interaction part @xmath68 and the simplified quark fragmentation matrix @xmath69 . expanding the latter in the dirac space",
    ", we have @xmath70 where we have suppressed the spin - independent terms as well as those arising from the hadronic final - state interaction because we do not address @xmath26 and @xmath27 as well as @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are quark fragmentation functions ( matrix elements ) at twist two , three , and four respectively , and their definitions can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the chiral - odd structure of @xmath72",
    ", one can immediately see that only by a quark mass insertion in the hard part can it make a nonzero contribution , so its contribution is actually at twist four",
    ".    keeping the first term in eq .",
    "( [ dc ] ) , we will have @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "notice that we have recovered the quark flavor index here . to confront with the general decomposition of @xmath76",
    ", we can simply substitute @xmath77 for @xmath36 and correspondingly @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "such replacements amount to including some effects at two higher twist so they are allowed . as a consequence",
    ", we have the following twist - two formulas : @xmath80    @xmath81    in fact , our factorization at leading twist reproduced the naive parton model results about @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the easiest way to recognize",
    "this point is to quantize the quark filed in the light - cone quantization formalism @xcite and carry out the integration over the unobserved hadron system @xcite . physically , if one notices that the quark transverse momentum with respect to the @xmath8 momentum has been integrated out , it is not difficult to understand the equivalence of this twist - two factorization result to the naive parton model approach",
    ".      now we turn to the case in which the spin of the inclusive @xmath8 hyperon is aligned along the normal of the production plane , namely , the @xmath82 axis . in this case , @xmath83=0 , so the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms in eq .",
    "( [ dec ] ) become degenerate . therefore , we hope to express the sum of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of some spin - dependent quark fragmentation functions .",
    "related to the transverse spin of the inclusive @xmath8 particle , the twist - two quark fragmentation function @xmath2 is chiral - odd . as a result ,",
    "its contribution comes about via a quark mass insertion in the hard part and correspondingly is at twist three .",
    "hence , we need to work at least at twist three and the lowest - order diagram as well as those two in fig . 2",
    "construct our subject .",
    "to the order at which we work , @xmath84 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4\\pi n}\\int \\frac{d^4 k}{(2\\pi)^4 } \\frac{d^4 k_1}{(2\\pi)^4 } { \\rm tr_d } { \\rm tr_c}\\left [ h^{\\mu\\nu\\sigma}_{(2a)}(q , k , k_1 ) x^\\prime _",

    "( [ www ] ) , we have absorbed the color matrix along with a minus strong coupling @xmath87 into @xmath88 and @xmath89 . obviously , the gauge invariance of eq .",
    "( [ www ] ) is not manifest .",
    "since we work up to twist three , we need to expand the hard part for the lowest - order diagram to the first nonleading term . as for those shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is enough to take their leading contributions . making use of the ward identity ,",
    "the twist - three contributions associated with the first derivative term in the expansion of the lowest - order hard part can be combined with the leading contributions of the two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "the net effect of such a combination is to replace the gluon field tensor by the covariant derivative operator in the two - variable fragmentation matrices coupled with the hard parts of the diagrams in fig .",
    "2 .    however , the ellis - furmanski - petronzio scheme is not a satisfactory procedure to extract nonleading twist contributions @xcite .",
    "the basic reason is that the leading term in the collinear expansion contains as well the nonleading contributions . to isolate such nonleading effects implicit in the leading term ,",
    "the efficient way is to pull down a certain number of `` special '' propagators into the hard part . in our twist - three case",
    ", we need to pull down @xmath90 special propagator along with the connected quark - gluon vertex into the hard part , either on the left - hand side or on the right - hand side of the final - state cut . in other words ,",
    "twist - three contributions hidden in the leading term of the collinear expansion of the lowest - order diagram can be taken into account by including the two diagrams in fig .",
    "3 . see what follows .",
    "the notation of the special propagator @xcite can be introduced as follows .",
    "consider the momentum carried by the quark propagator in fig .",
    "2 that links the electromagnetic vertex to the quark - gluon one , one can parameterize it as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the on - shell part of @xmath93 .",
    "correspondingly , the quark propagator is decomposed into two parts : @xmath94 technically , @xmath95 is termed the special propagator by qiu and labelled by adding a bar on the normal propagator in the graphic representation . to unravel the physical content of the special propagator ,",
    "let us consider the fourier transformation @xmath96\\frac{i\\rlap / k}{k^2+i\\varepsilon } = \\delta(\\xi_1^+ - \\xi^+_2 ) \\frac{i\\gamma^+}{2 k^+ } + \\theta ( \\xi_1^+ -\\xi^+_2 ) \\frac{\\rlap/{\\hat k}}{2k^+ } \\exp[-i\\frac{k^2_t}{2 k^+}(\\xi_1^+ -\\xi^+_2)],\\ ] ] from which it can be seen that the special propagator describes a short - distance , or `` contact '' interaction in the light - cone .",
    "hence , as one goes beyond the leading twist for the lowest - order diagram , a special propagator along with the connected quark - gluon vertex should be pulled down into the hard part . considering that the diagrams shown in fig",
    "3 can be obtained from the lowest - order diagram by pulling out a quark propagator and its connected quark - gluon vertex , it can also be stated that the non - contact part of its linking propagator should be discarded , because they have been included in @xmath97 .",
    "it should be stressed that qiu @xcite has demonstrated that such a cure can naturally reserve the gauge invariance for the hard part .    from the above discussions , we know that the formula for calculating the hadronic tensor reads @xmath98 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4\\pi n}\\int d(\\frac{1}{z_1 } )",

    "we conclude this paper by discussing the phenomenological implications of our factorization results about @xmath0 and @xmath1 . here",

    "( [ ss1 ] ) and in ( [ ss2 ] ) the flavor summation can be dropped .",
    "futhermore , the terms associated with the quark mass in ( [ ss2 ] ) can be ignored at a first - order approximation because @xmath117 .",
    "although not discussed here , we can believe that by controlling judiciously the polarization of the initial - state electron beam and analyzing the final - state @xmath8 polarization , it is possible to measure @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the measurement of these two structure functions will allow for the determination of two @xmath9 fragmentation functions @xmath71 and @xmath118 .",
    "it should be noted that eq .",
    "( [ ss1 ] ) might be not so helpful .",
    "the reason is that @xmath119 can be independently measured at the lep , which burkardt and jaffe have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . at the @xmath120 resonance ,",
    "the parity violation can naturally generate longitudinally - polarized strange quarks so one does not need to polarize the initial - state beam . however , eq . ( [ ss2 ] ) is by no means trivial .",
    "so far , the measurement of chiral - odd nonperturbative matrix elements , to which @xmath121 and @xmath3 belong , have been a challenge to the particle physics community .",
    "so far , the general strategy to treat them has been tackling them in pairs [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , @xcite .",
    "our results , eq .",
    "( [ ss2 ] ) , indicates that once we have known @xmath121 from other sources or it can be neglected at the first approximation , the measurement of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , present us a relatively clean situation , in which information about twist - three fragmentation function @xmath118 can be obtained .",
    "the penalty in such a scheme is to polarize one of the initial - state beams .",
    "as is well known , it is now quite feasible to obtain highly polarized electron beams .    in summary , we worked out a qcd field theory study of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , two spin - dependent structure functions for the inclusive spin - half baryon production in electron - positron annihilation . making use of the collinear expansion procedure by ellis , furmanski and petronzio , and the special propagator concept by qiu",
