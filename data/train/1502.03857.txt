    "the ultimate fate of the miniaturization of information processing devices naturally leads to the quantum regime even for realizing classical computers .",
    "although quantum computation holds the promise to be the next step in the evolution of information technology , quantum algorithms have been proved to speed up only very specific computational tasks , notably prime factorization shor1997polynomial and database search @xcite . moreover , quantum mechanical systems are , in principle , based on unitary operations which are reversible and thus dissipation - less . in view of this , using a quantum device might also provide a solution to certain technological obstacles in classical information technology , _ e.g. _ heat production .",
    "such information processing is also less demanding with respect to quantum coherence and their realization is thus less challenging .",
    "additionally the miniaturization of electronics ( even in the context of classical computation ) with the demands of more data and functional density naturally leads to the quantum world .",
    "any information processing device essentially needs at least two different units to operate properly , namely a long - lived memory and a fast data - bus for communication between different registers or processors .",
    "the cells of the memory unit have to be well isolated from the rest of the system .",
    "there are several atomic scale spin systems which show suitable properties for operating as memories , such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond @xcite , nuclear spins in solid state systems @xcite , molecular magnets @xcite and adatoms on surfaces @xcite .",
    "in contrast , for information transfer , a strong interaction between the cells of the data - bus is required for fast operation within the coherence time .",
    "good examples of quantum systems with strong interactions includes , ion traps @xcite , superconducting qubits barends2014superconducting , electronic spins in gated quantum dots petta2005coherent , shulman2012demonstration , and donors in silicon kane1998silicon , zwanenburg2013silicon .",
    "the opposite demands for isolated memory and strongly interacting data - bus units make it notoriously difficult to implement both units in the same physical device . while hybrid structures ( e.g. atom - photon , superconducting qubits - microwave , nuclear - electronic spin ) have been proposed @xcite for fulfilling this task , a very high degree of precision is needed to control two different physical systems and their interaction , in order to transfer information from one system to another .    in this work",
    "we show that nano - magnets with a large half - integer spin momentum can simultaneously act both as memory and data - bus for information transfer within the same setup without the complexity of hybrid structures .",
    "in fact , the spin levels in neighboring sites can interact through different mechanisms resulting in exchange interactions which may vary several orders of magnitude between different spin levels .",
    "in large - spin systems , we propose to use the flexibility in selecting two weakly interacting low - energy spin levels for encoding a classical bit , while strongly interacting high - energy spin levels , act quantum mechanically for transferring such information between distant memory cells .",
    "information transfer between the two units , namely the high and low energy subspaces , is achieved via global electromagnetic pulses acting on the whole system .",
    "we specifically consider an array of high - spin magnets which interact through the heisenberg hamiltonian with a large zero - field energy splitting @xcite .",
    "we show that such a large energy - level separation together with the inherent selection rule determined by the interaction results in different effective exchange interaction for the low- and high - energy subspaces .",
    "this in turn implies that the low - energy levels display a weak effective interaction , making them suitable for storage , while high - energy levels result in a strong effective interaction which can be exploited for fast information transmission .",
    "although higher spin systems have been proposed for quantum communication @xcite , neither of them can implement both the memory and data - bus .",
    "our proposed mechanism can be realized in different physical implementations of high - spin magnets with large zero - field splitting .",
    "this includes magnetic adatoms on surfaces @xcite , donors on silicon kane1998silicon , zwanenburg2013silicon and molecular magnets troiani2011molecular , timco2009engineering , nakahara:1320438,ardavan2007will , mitrikas2008electron .",
    "we specifically consider the latter as a testbed for implementing our proposal . indeed , molecular magnets have recently attracted lot of attentions thanks to the flexibility in engineering their properties through chemical synthesis @xcite and their long - coherence time @xcite .",
    "our proposal , is fully accessible to current technology and allows for hundreds of operations using the same parameters achieved in recent experiments @xcite within the coherence time of the system .",
    "we consider a one dimensional system composed of @xmath0 quantum nanomagnets with a certain spin @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic interaction is described by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the strength of the isotropic exchange interaction between magnets and @xmath4 is the local hamiltonian acting on the @xmath5th magnet . as a paradigmatic model we consider @xmath6 ~ , \\label{hs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the magnetic field",

    "the transition between the low and high energy subspaces can be achieved with a global resonant pulse . ]",
    "the states @xmath18 , which are the stable states when @xmath19 , are not suitable to implement a memory because a magnetic field , whatever small , can induce a transition between them . on the other hand , the states @xmath20 , which are the stable states when @xmath21 , represent a good candidate to implement a classical bit in a quantum memory because there is no direct physical coupling between them .",
    "in fact , since a jump between these two states can only occur via multiple - step processes , bit flip errors are exponentially suppressed .",
    "for @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , as a function of @xmath25 . when @xmath26 a band structure appears in the spectrum .",
    "the lowest energy band ( composed by the @xmath27 levels in the subspace @xmath28 ) forms the memory subspace , while the highest energy band ( composed by the @xmath27 levels in the subspace @xmath29 ) forms the data - bus subspace . ]    in this section we prove that the low - energy hilbert space ( that we call memory subspace ) @xmath30 is suitable to store information , while the high energy hilbert space @xmath31 can be used to implement a data - bus for fast information transfer between remote memory cells .",
    "we start our analysis by deriving two effective hamiltonians respectively within the two subspaces . for the moment we concentrate on @xmath32 spin systems ( though later in the paper we will extend our analysis to higher spin systems ) where @xmath33 for negative @xmath11 , in the regime @xmath26 , these two effective subspaces become energetically well separated . to see this , in fig.[fig : bands ]",
    "we plot the spectrum of @xmath34 as a function of @xmath11 .",
    "as it is evident from the figure , a band structure appears when @xmath26 in which the lowest band is formed by states in the memory subspace @xmath35 , while the highest band is formed by states in the data - bus subspace @xmath36 . if we initialize our systems in one the bands , throughout the dynamics other bands are hardly populated",
    "this suggests that there should be an effective description for the dynamics within the memory and data - bus subspaces . in the next section we provide effective hamiltonians for each of these subspaces .",
    "we now consider the regime where @xmath21 and @xmath26 while @xmath13 . in this regime",
    "the states @xmath37 are degenerate and well separated from the states @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to get an effective interaction between the low energy states @xmath37 which is mediated through a `` virtual '' coupling with the high energy states .",
    "we derive the effective hamiltonian using the theory presented in supplementary material , which is based on two key assumptions : ( i ) large energy separation ( @xmath39 ) between the states @xmath37 and the states @xmath38 ; ( ii ) no initial population of the states @xmath38 .",
    "we found that up to the second order in @xmath40 and @xmath41 one gets @xmath42 where , @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the bulk and @xmath45 at the boundaries .",
    "( with @xmath46 ) , which arises in the third order perturbation theory used for getting the effective hamiltonian ( see supplementary material for more details ) .",
    "in fact , the three consecutive operations of the term @xmath47 result in spin swap in the low - energy subspace through virtually populating the high - energy states .",
    "we show the states @xmath48 , for @xmath49 ( a ) , @xmath50 ( b ) , @xmath51 ( c ) , @xmath52 ( d ) , which are populated during the process . ]    in the matrices @xmath53 are pauli operators defined in the effective subspace @xmath54 . to the lowest order",
    "the effective interaction in the low - energy subspace is of ising - type , as shown also in @xcite , and thus does not induce direct transitions between energy levels .",
    "magnetic exchange between two neighboring sites is governed by a third order effect , as reflected in the effective coupling @xmath55 displayed in eq .  .",
    "this third order process is mediated by the virtual processes depicted in fig .",
    "[ figslow ] where two high - energy levels are populated .",
    "since the exchange is only a third order process in @xmath40 , an eventual magnetic transfer between neighboring sites would take place in the large time scale of @xmath56 .",
    "those transfer mechanisms can thus be ignored ( for suitably large @xmath11 ) in all processes that are governed by lower order mechanisms , such as the transfer in the higher energy subspace that we will discuss later .",
    "hence , it is legitimate to use this subspace as a memory for storing information .",
    "notice that the difference between ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings , _",
    "i.e. _ the sign of @xmath3 , does not alter the results of our proposal , as the system is not initialized in the ground state .",
    "we now consider the scenario in which the system is prepared in the high energy subspace spanned by @xmath38 .",

    "we also compute the fidelity with @xmath83 to check the validity of the effective hamiltonian @xmath84 in higher - energy subspace .",

    "the perfect match of the two curves in figs.[longdistancecomm ] ( a ) and ( b ) shows negligible influence of the lower - energy subspace on transfer of the information initially written in the higher - energy subspace along the nano - magnete chain , and thus the higher - energy subspace could function as a data - bus for quantum information transfer .    in the high - energy subspace two neighboring spins are directly coupled by the heisenberg interaction .",
    "this results in a very large exchange coupling , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath87 ) which , in turns , implies a very fast transfer dynamics compared with the low energy subspace . as @xmath88",
    ", one can see that in the regime where the effective hamiltonian picture is valid ( say @xmath89 ) , the high energy subspace is faster by at least two orders of magnitude .",
    "this justifies the use of the high - energy subspace for computational tasks with a fast bit transmission .    to quantify quality of the bit transfer",
    "one can consider the time @xmath90 at which the fidelity @xmath91 , given in eq .",
    ", peaks for the first time and takes the value @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , in real systems , decoherence deteriorates the quality of bit - transfer and it is unwise to wait for later peaks . to see the scalability of the bit transfer in larger chains we plot @xmath93 , using the effective hamiltonian , as a function of length @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ longdistancecomm](c ) .",
    "although due to the non - linear dispersion relation , the maximum fidelity @xmath93 decreases with increasing @xmath0 , it still remains above @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",

    "[ longdistancecomm](c ) we see that the transverse anisotropy @xmath12 has always a detrimental role for transmission , therefore those systems with vanishing @xmath12 are preferable .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the effective hamiltonian description is always valid for all @xmath0 provided that @xmath26 . in view of this , the decrease of @xmath96 as a function of @xmath0 is only due to the dispersive dynamics of the effective hamiltonian ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . in order to improve",
    "the fidelity for larger values of @xmath0 one has to linearize the dispersion relation through local engineering of the system parameters ( such as the exchange coupling @xmath3 ) , as extensively discussed in the literature @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "longdistancecomm(d ) , the optimal time @xmath97 linearly increases by @xmath0 but still is , at least , one order of magnitude faster than the time scale of bit swap in the memory subspace , given by @xmath56 .",
    "note that the distance over which a bit can be moved , strictly speacking , needs not be limited .",
    "for example we can adapt some minimal engineering techniques to move bits over much longer distances @xcite , though here the hamiltonian is rather different .",
    "we now study how one can simultaneously transfer all the states from the low - energy to the high - energy subspace and _ vice versa_. when the chain is composed of a single nanomagnet , the memory ( @xmath98 ) and bus ( @xmath99 ) hilbert subspaces have an energy separation of @xmath100 . a resonant spin transition can be obtained with an electromagnetic pulse @xmath101 with @xmath102 .",
    "this physically motivated intuition can be made more rigorous . indeed , near resonance , the time - dependent interactions can be approximated in the rotating picture with a time - independent hamiltonian , and the off resonant energy levels are then traced out using theory presented in the supplementary material .",
    "we found that in the limit @xmath103 a transition with @xmath104 occurs with a transition time @xmath105 $ ] and a transition fidelity @xmath106 .",
    "therefore , in the limit @xmath107 the transition fidelity is almost one , as it has been proved by our numerical simulations ( not shown here ) .    on the other hand , in a many nanomagnet scenario",
    "the pulse has to be fast enough to neglect the interaction @xmath3 between neighboring magnets , so the optimal working regime is @xmath108 .",
    "the procedure described above can be applied also for higher half - integer spin @xmath1 systems .",
    "in fact , the dynamics in the high energy subspace @xmath38 is still governed by an effective hamiltonian which has a similar form of eq .  .",
    "in particular , the leading term is an exchange coupling which results in fast transmission times ( @xmath109 ) .",
    "in contrast , the storage quality of the memory subspace @xmath110 is significantly improved as @xmath1 increases . indeed , the effective coupling @xmath111 becomes smaller by increasing @xmath1 , making the storage much less prone to errors over a longer time scale .",
    "however , in some higher - spin systems , like rare - earth ions , there might be higher order anisotropy terms ( i.e. stevens operators ) in the hamiltonian @xcite which might change the effective couplings .",
    "in addition , bit - flip errors , i.e. spurious transitions between the states @xmath110 , are exponentially suppressed as they require multiple jumps through higher energy levels .",
    "this , however , comes with the price that a transition from the memory to the data - bus subspaces demands multiple pulse sequences ( namely @xmath112 consecutive pulses ) which increase the complexity of the process .",
    "in this section we consider two sources of imperfections which may affect our protocol , namely decoherence and possible long - range interactions arising , _ e.g. _ , from dipolar couplings between distant nanomagnets .      in a real physical system",
    "it is notoriously difficult to keep the system isolated from the surrounding environment .",
    "depending on the nature of the interaction between the system and the environment one may have different decoherence processes .",
    "in particular , for the main target experiments of our theoretical proposal , e.g. molecular magnets and magnetic adatoms on surfaces , the dissipation time @xmath113 is larger than the dephasing time @xmath114 by several order of magnitudes .",
    "dephasing , which is thus the main source of decoherence , arises because of complicated interactions with other degrees of freedom . in this paper",
    "we consider a simple model of decoherence , i.e. caused by random energy level fluctuations due to nearby magnetic and electric impurities . by averaging over the possible random time fluctuations",
    "one obtains a master equation for the evolution of the system which has the lindblad form @xcite@xmath115+\\gamma \\sum_{j}\\left ( l_{j}\\rho l_{j}^{\\dagger } -\\frac{1}{2}l_{j}^{\\dagger } l_{j}\\rho -\\frac{1}{2}\\rho l_{j}^{\\dagger } l_{j}\\right ) ~ , \\label{lindblad}\\]]where @xmath116 is the system density matrix , @xmath117 is the dephasing rate and @xmath118 are lindblad operators . due to the fact that @xmath119 , we only consider dephasing here , which can be modeled with @xmath120 .",

    "the realistic values are indeed much smaller ( @xmath128 as discussed in the next section ) and allows for very high quality transfer even in long chains . due to the damping dynamics shown in the plot it is wise to only concentrate on the first peak of the fidelity @xmath93 .",

    "recently adatomic clusters loth2012bistability , and adatoms themselves @xcite on surfaces have indeed been proposed as a quantum storage of a classical bit .",
    "their dephasing has been studied using the same type of weak coupling lindbladian master equations as considered by us here delgado2012storage .",
    "this approach has become even more accurate very recently with the advent of superconducting layers replacing the usual two dimensional electron gas in stm so as to greatly increase electron relaxation times for the adatoms @xcite . as electron spin scattering",
    "is suppressed because of the energy gap of the superconductor , we also naturally expect the dephasing time to be enhanced in addition to the relaxation time .",
    "though the dephasing time is yet to be measured , this kind of work is ultimately aimed towards taking adatoms towards the regime of coherently operating devices .",
    "another technique by which the effective isolation of adatoms has been greatly enhanced is by using symmetry protected systems @xcite .",
    "these give the hope that adatoms will eventually approach the coherent regime @xcite so that coherent non - equilibrium dynamics , as used in our paper , will become accessible .",
    "very large anisotropies @xmath11 have also been recently achieved @xcite for co atoms , for example .",
    "microwaves could still be used for changing between the memory and data - bus modes of the chain , but measurements can be done locally at leisure using spin polarized stms @xcite after setting the device to memory mode .",
    "moreover , we can bring a magnetic tip close to the adatom ( as in the newly devised magnetic exchange force microscopy , which is compatible with stm setup ) to apply a local field to it @xcite .",
    "this local field , if in a pertinent direction , can directly precess the adatom s spins . alternatively , it can locally zeeman split the energy levels so that a microwave can locally flip it .",
    "in particular , a more macroscopic nanomagnetic bit attached to the stm tip could be made to talk to the adatom bit by bringing the tip in proximity to it @xcite .",
    "this may offer a route to interface the system we discussed here with more conventional magnetic memory with larger magnetic bits .",
    "a general problem in any information processing architecture is that memory cells are supposed to be well decoupled from each other to act as a good information storage , while the data - bus cells should have strong interactions to implement fast quantum gates and information transfer .",
    "the different interactions required in the memory and data - bus units make it very challenging to spot a physical system suitable for both , so one way to face this problem is to use hybrid structures monroe2014large , xiang2013hybrid ,",
    "carretta2013quantum which demands very sophisticated control of the system . to avoid such complexities , in this paper",
    "we have proposed a mechanism to implement memory and data - bus units , two key requirements for any processor , with the same physical setup , namely arrays of large - spin magnets .",
    "the data - bus and memory subspaces are encoded into different spin levels of the same magnet .",
    "the selection rules imposed by the exchange coupling together with a large zero field energy splitting result in different effective coupling between spin levels of the two neighboring magnets . while high - energy spin levels are directly coupled by the exchange interaction , lower energy subspaces are coupled only via higher - order processes , which become ineffective in the time scales of operations in the high - energy subspace .",
    "hence , the high - energy subspace is suitable for transmission tasks , while the low - energy subspace can act as a robust memory .",
    "transitions between the two subspaces can be done at will by applying resonant external pulses .    despite having",
    "not gone into the details of how one would engineer gates between the magnetic bits , we would like to point out that bit movement is already a significant step towards it .",
    "for example , for other ( incoherent ) mechanisms of bit movement , gates were immediately accomplished by bringing two bits in close proximity @xcite .",
    "of course , in continuation with our coherent bit movement protocol , we would expect that a xor gate should be implementable for bits brought next to each other ( by data - buses ) and in memory subspace through their dominantly ising interaction of eq .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theory that has been developed does not depend on a particular physical realization and can be applied to many systems , such as magnetic adatoms on surfaces @xcite , donors on silicon kane1998silicon , zwanenburg2013silicon and molecular magnets troiani2011molecular , timco2009engineering , nakahara:1320438,ardavan2007will , mitrikas2008electron . the desirable requirements for our scheme are : ( i ) addressability of some individual magnets to accomplish read / write operations ; ( ii ) long coherence times for transfer over tens of magnetic cells , but not as demanding as for quantum computation ; ( iii ) flexibility in engineering the couplings ; ( iv ) large zero - field energy splitting ; and ( v ) intrinsically vanishing in - plain anisotropy .",
    "our proposed mechanism can be realized in molecular magnets with current technology , and we showed that , using parameters taken from recent experiments , it allows for hundreds of operations within the coherence time of the system .",
