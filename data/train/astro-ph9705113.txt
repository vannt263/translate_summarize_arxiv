    "high - redshift absorbers offer a glimpse of structure in the young universe .",
    "these systems dominate the mass density of neutral gas in the universe at early times and are believed to be forming galaxies ( wolfe et al . 1995 ; djorgovski et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the fraction @xmath3 of the present - day critical density residing in neutral gas in these objects increases monotonically with redshift to @xmath7 ( lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ; wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ) . at still higher redshifts , @xmath8",
    ", recent optical spectroscopy of 27 quasars indicates a decline in @xmath3 ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "this behavior is roughly what is expected in a hierarchical model of galaxy formation : a rise in @xmath3 as protogalaxies are assembled , then a decline towards low redshifts as gas is converted into stars .",
    "the precise evolutionary behavior of @xmath3 depends , however , on the models and can provide strong constraints on cosmological parameters when compared to the observations .",
    "several authors have applied the semi - analytic press - schechter ( 1974 ) theory for the mass function of dark matter halos to estimate @xmath3 in cdm and cdm+hdm models ( mo & miralda - escude 1994 ; kauffmann & charlot 1994 ; klypin et al .",
    "however , this analysis depends sensitively on the collapse overdensity parameter @xmath9 and on the assumed range of circular velocities of halos which are able to host systems . to reduce the uncertainties associated with this approach , ma & bertschinger ( 1994 ) estimated @xmath3 and the column density distribution @xmath2 of absorbers directly from the dark matter halos in @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "all of these studies assumed that all the gas in a dark halo becomes neutral and that the gas mass fraction in each halo is equal to the global baryon fraction .",
    "this assumption is optimistic , and therefore conservative from the point of view of ruling out cosmological models .",
    "nonetheless , all studies found that the then - preferred @xmath10 version of the cdm+hdm model was ruled out by the observed abundance of absorbers at @xmath11 .",
    "ma & bertschinger ( 1994 ) argued that even an @xmath12 model would underpredict @xmath3 by a factor of @xmath13 . with hydrodynamic simulations one can calculate the abundance and properties of systems directly , including the effects of gas dynamics , radiative cooling , and photoionization .",
    "the required computations are expensive and complicated , however , and so far only the standard cdm model has been studied in this way ( katz et al .  1996b , hereafter kwhm ) .",
    "the goals of this _ letter _ are to study the consequences of dissipation and radiative processes for systems in cosmological simulations and to obtain the strongest possible constraints on cdm+hdm models from the new data at @xmath14 ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1996abc ) , which have yet to be considered in this context .",
    "we use the kwhm hydrodynamic simulation of standard cdm to compare @xmath2 and @xmath3 of systems as inferred from the gas particles directly and from the dark matter alone .",
    "the results from the cdm model are then used to calibrate our dark - matter - only , @xmath6 , cdm+hdm simulation .",
    "this approach combines the virtues of both types of simulations and provides us with the most efficient way to obtain reliable results that incorporate gas dynamical effects without performing an expensive hydrodynamic simulation for the cdm+hdm model .",
    "the results presented here for the @xmath15 cdm+hdm model are based on the particle - particle - particle - mesh ( p@xmath16 m ) simulation reported in ma & bertschinger ( 1994 ) and ma ( 1995 ) .",
    "the model assumes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "the simulation includes a total of 23 million particles ( @xmath21 cold and @xmath22 hot ) in a cubic box of comoving sides @xmath23 mpc .",
    "the comoving plummer force softening is @xmath24 kpc , and the particle masses are @xmath25 for the cold and @xmath26 for the hot particles .",
    "as shown by ma ( 1995 ) and fig .  1 of this _ letter _ , increasing the mass resolution of the particles by a factor of @xmath27 has negligible effects on our results .",
    "the primordial power spectrum has a spectral index of @xmath28 , with density fluctuations drawn from a random gaussian field .",
    "the normalization corresponds to the 4-year cobe rms quadrupole moment @xmath29 ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ; gorski et al . 1996 ) , or @xmath30 for the rms mass fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath31 mpc .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulation used here was performed with a treesph code ( hernquist & katz 1989 ; katz , weinberg , & hernquist 1996a ) .",
    "we follow the evolution of structure in a conventional cdm universe with @xmath32 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , with the bardeen et al .",
    "( 1986 ) transfer function for negligible baryon density .",
    "the simulation volume is a periodic cube of comoving sides @xmath33 mpc , and it contains @xmath34 gas and @xmath34 cdm particles .",
    "the comoving gravitational softening length of all particles is @xmath35 kpc .",
    "the gas and cdm particles have masses @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "a uniform ionizing background of @xmath38 erg s@xmath39 @xmath5 sr@xmath39 hz@xmath39 is included , where the redshift dependence @xmath40 is taken to be unity for @xmath41 , @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and zero for @xmath44 . since the metallicity of intergalactic gas at @xmath45 appears to be 1% or less of solar ( see , e.g. , songaila & cowie 1996 and the modeling in haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1996 and hellsten et al .",
    "1997 ) , we use a primordial hydrogen - helium composition ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) to compute cooling rates .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized to give @xmath48 today .",
    "this normalization leads to roughly the observed masses of rich galaxy clusters ( white , efstathiou , & frenk 1993 ) , but it is nearly a factor of two below that implied by cobe ( gorski et al .",
    "our goal here is not to investigate the validity of this model .",
    "rather , we wish to address the general issue of the relative distribution of gas and dark matter in galactic halos and apply the results to the @xmath6 cdm+hdm model , which comes closer to matching simultaneously the cobe observations and the statistics of galaxies and clusters ( ma 1996 ) .    since we will use the kwhm treesph run to calibrate the expected effects of gas dynamics in the cdm+hdm n - body run , our analysis implicitly assumes that the kwhm predictions for damped absorption in the cdm model are approximately correct , despite the finite resolution of the simulation .",
    "the physical dimensions of the damped absorbers are typically @xmath49kpc ( see figure 2 of kwhm ) , significantly larger than the gravitational softening at @xmath50 [ @xmath51kpc ] .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that the overall sizes of the systems are much affected by the gravitational force softening .",
    "the cold gas in the damped absorbers is almost entirely neutral because of its high density and self - shielding , so the neutral fraction of this component is insensitive to resolution .",
    "however , a substantial fraction of the gas in virialized objects remains hot and produces little absorption , an effect that is quite important to our results .",
    "the fraction of cooled gas can be sensitive to mass resolution in some regimes ( weinberg et al .",
    "1997 ) , though a hot gas fraction comparable to that in our halos is found even in 3-d and 1-d simulations with much higher resolution ( quinn et al .",
    "1996 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; however , navarro & steinmetz 1997 find more efficient cooling in their simulations ) .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in the kwhm predictions is the inability of such simulations to model substructure on scales much smaller than the dla systems themselves .",
    "we effectively assume that the gas distribution in damped absorbers is fairly smooth on kpc scales , whereas strong clumping could systematically shift absorption from low column densities to high column densities .",
    "studies of dla absorbers in gravitationally lensed quasars may eventually provide empirical constraints on the coherence of damped systems .",
    "the two characteristics of systems that we choose to examine , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are related by @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the critical mass density today , @xmath55 is the hydrogen mass , @xmath56 takes into account that 24% of the mass is helium , and @xmath57 .",
    "the upper limit to the integral could in principle be infinity , but in practice absorbers have been observed only up to @xmath58 ( wolfe et al .",
    "1995 ; storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "the absence of observed systems with higher @xmath1 may reflect the small - number statistical limitations of current data , or it may indicate that at higher column densities the gas has been converted into stars .",
    "the observed @xmath59 is given by the number of absorbers with hi column density in the range @xmath60 in an absorption distance of @xmath61 ( for @xmath62 ) .",
    "the most reliable estimate of @xmath2 in the cdm simulations comes from the gas component in the treesph run .",
    "we project the gas particles in the simulation box onto a two - dimensional grid and compute the neutral hydrogen column density in each pixel .",
    "details of the correction for self - shielding are described in kwhm . to compare with earlier work",
    ", we compute @xmath2 from the _ dark matter _ component of the treesph simulation by projecting each dark matter halo onto a two - dimensional grid , and converting from dark matter surface density to neutral hydrogen column density assuming a uniform ratio of neutral gas to dark matter , @xmath63 , and a hydrogen baryon mass fraction @xmath46 .",
    "the dark halos are identified with the denmax algorithm ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ; frederic 1995 ) , with no overdensity constraint imposed .",
    "the solid and long - dashed curves in figure  1 compare @xmath2 at @xmath64 obtained from the gas and dark matter components in the treesph simulation .",
    "it shows a steeper slope for @xmath2 inferred from the dark matter than from the gas , with the two curves crossing at @xmath65 @xmath5 .",
    "the difference at the high column density end is most likely due to the cooling of the gas component , which allows it to contract to a higher density than the dissipationless dark matter , leading to a higher @xmath2 in figure  1 .",
    "the difference at the lower column densities could potentially reflect either different density profiles of dark matter and _ total _ gas in the outskirts of galactic halos , or ionization that reduces the _ neutral _ gas fraction in these regions ( or both ) . to investigate the two factors separately , we computed the distribution function for the _ total _ hydrogen column density in the treesph simulation .",
    "we found an @xmath2 that closely matches that inferred from the dark matter at column densities @xmath66 , as expected if the dark matter and the _ total _ gas indeed have similar density profiles outside the core of each halo .",
    "the gas and dark matter profiles in figure 1 of quinn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) also support this result .",
    "ionization therefore plays the dominant role in reducing @xmath2 .",
    "simulations like these consistently show that cold gas lumps are embedded within halos of much hotter gas ( e.g. , katz , hernquist , & weinberg 1992 ; evrard , summers , & davis 1994 ) , with little gas at intermediate temperatures .",
    "the cold gas is almost entirely neutral because of its high density and because of self - shielding .",
    "the large difference between the dark matter and gas @xmath2 histograms at @xmath67 in figure  1 is driven almost entirely by collisional ionization of the hot gas component .",
    "two other issues must be addressed before the results of figure  1 are applied to @xmath1-body simulations of the cdm+hdm model .",
    "the first is the gravitational effect of the dense gas concentration on the dark matter in the centers of halos .",
    "the baryons , which constitute only 5% of the mass density in these models , clearly have little dynamical effect on the global clustering of the halos , but their efficient cooling in high density regions increases the depth of the gravitational potential well and can result in a higher concentration of dark matter near the halo centers in hydrodynamic simulations than in @xmath1-body runs . to quantify this effect",
    ", we performed a simulation identical to the treesph run with the sph portion turned off ( i.e. , a tree run ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 from this dark - matter - only run is shown as a short - dashed curve in figure  1 .",
    "the two histograms for the dark matter follow each other closely until @xmath68 @xmath5 , beyond which the tree @xmath2 falls below the treesph run by more than a factor of two .",
    "the second factor to be considered is the difference in simulation parameters between the small - box , high - resolution , hydrodynamic cdm run and the large - box , lower resolution , @xmath1-body cdm+hdm run . to bridge this gap ,",
    "we compute @xmath2 ( shown as dotted curve in fig .",
    "1 ) from a p@xmath16 m cdm simulation performed by gelb & bertschinger ( 1994a , b ) , which employed a numerical algorithm and numerical parameters similar to those of our p@xmath16 m cdm+hdm run : @xmath69 kpc for the plummer force softening distance , @xmath23 mpc box , and @xmath70 particles .",
    "the agreement among the various curves at @xmath71 @xmath5 is remarkable . at higher column densities ,",
    "the p@xmath16 m curve falls sharply , presumably because of the lower force resolution .",
    "the difference is , however , only @xmath72% up to the highest observed column densities ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , and it will be taken into account below .",
    "having investigated the systematic effects on @xmath2 of dissipation , ionization , and simulation parameters in the standard cdm model , we now turn to the @xmath6 cdm+hdm model .",
    "ma & bertschinger ( 1994 ) found that @xmath2 from the large p@xmath16 m @xmath1-body simulation of this model was too steep compared to the data at @xmath11 , although they anticipated that ionization and gaseous dissipation would decrease the @xmath2 slope .",
    "figure  1 now allows us to estimate the correction needed to `` convert '' dark matter to gas .",
    "we use the ratio of @xmath2 from the gas component in the treesph run ( solid curve in fig .  1 ) and @xmath2 from the dark matter in the p@xmath16 m run ( dotted curve ) as the correction factor .",
    "we multiply @xmath2 from the cdm+hdm run by this factor for each column - density bin to correct for the effects of ionization and dissipation .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 is shown in figure  2 for redshifts @xmath73 and 4 .",
    "since the observed column density range extends only to @xmath74 @xmath5 , the gas correction mainly acts to reduce @xmath2 inferred from the dark matter and therefore worsens the problem of late galaxy formation in cdm+hdm models .",
    "there is a serious deficit of systems in the @xmath6 cdm+hdm model in the highest bin ( @xmath75 @xmath5 ) for all 3 redshifts , and a deficit for all column densities at @xmath76 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the observed @xmath2 are based on small numbers of systems : 12 for the redshift bin @xmath77 , and 8 for @xmath78 ( storrie - lombardi et al 1996b ) .",
    "moreover , some of the high - redshift systems await confirmation from high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "if the current candidate systems are found to be blending of weaker lines , the data points will be lowered .    in the calculation",
    "above , we have assumed the same gas to dark matter conversion factor for @xmath2 in the cdm and cdm+hdm models .",
    "although the hdm component in the latter is less clustered than the cdm component below the neutrino free - streaming scale , we do not expect the 20% hdm present in this model to significantly alter the relation between gas and dark matter @xmath2 in figure  1 for the cdm model .",
    "the neutral gas fraction in systems , @xmath3 , is less constraining than @xmath2 , but it is still an interesting quantity to measure .",
    "wolfe et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find @xmath79 at @xmath80 , while the combined apm and wolfe et al .",
    "sample gives @xmath81 at @xmath80 and @xmath82 at @xmath83 ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "theoretical predictions for @xmath3 depend sensitively on the upper integration limit @xmath84 if the slope of @xmath2 is flatter than @xmath85 as observed .",
    "kwhm found the fraction of cold , dense gas in the cdm simulation to be @xmath86 , 0.0036 , and 0.0017 at @xmath87 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "however , if we integrate @xmath2 over the observed column density range of systems we find much lower @xmath3 values for this model : 0.0011 , 0.00096 , and 0.00069 at @xmath87 , and 4 .",
    "this drastic reduction arises because the contribution to @xmath3 is dominated by the highest column density systems , which extend only to @xmath74 @xmath5 in the observations but to @xmath88 @xmath5 in the hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "to compare fairly with observations , we choose @xmath74 @xmath5 as the upper limit in @xmath3 .",
    "when we use the gas - corrected @xmath2 to compute @xmath3 for the @xmath6 cdm+hdm model , we find @xmath89 , 0.00025 , and 0.0002 at @xmath90 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the values at @xmath91 and 4 are nearly an order of magnitude below the storrie - lombardi et al . results .",
    "gardner et al .",
    "( 1997b ) also finds deficiency in the number of systems in this model .",
    "in comparison to the most recent data on systems ( storrie - lombardi et al .",
    "1996abc ) , we find the @xmath6 cdm+hdm model to underpredict the column density distribution @xmath2 of systems at all column densities for @xmath92 and in the column density range @xmath93 @xmath94 @xmath5 for @xmath95 . neither the cdm nor the cdm+hdm model reproduces the observed trend towards a steeper @xmath2 at higher redshifts . we have included the effects of gaseous dissipation and ionization in our calculations by using the relative @xmath2 from gas and dark matter in a cdm treesph simulation to modify @xmath2 from the cdm+hdm p@xmath16 m run . without considering cooling and ionization , one would obtain too steep an @xmath2 from @xmath1-body simulations by assuming that neutral gas traces dark matter .",
    "the dark matter underpredicts @xmath2 at higher column densities due to the lack of dissipation , and it overpredicts @xmath2 at @xmath96 @xmath5 , primarily because gas ionization on the outskirts of galactic halos reduces the neutral column densities .    we have also argued that only systems up to the observed limit @xmath65 @xmath5 should be included in the estimation of @xmath3 for a fair comparison with data .",
    "all earlier estimates that assumed all the baryons in dark halos would contribute to absorption have overestimated @xmath3 .",
    "the inclusion of gaseous processes therefore exacerbates the problem of late galaxy formation in all cdm+hdm models reported earlier .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the observed @xmath2 and @xmath3 are inferred from a small number of systems , some of which are yet to be confirmed by high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we caution that theoretical predictions of the abundance of galactic objects at high redshifts are in general very sensitive to the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "if the previous 2-year cobe result @xmath97 ( @xmath98 above the 4-year @xmath99 ) is used to normalize the cdm+hdm model , the predictions in figure  2 would be less pessimistic .",
    "however , it is generally the case that the parameter changes that would alleviate the problems of late galaxy formation in cdm+hdm ( e.g. , higher normalization , lower @xmath100 , @xmath101 primeval fluctuation spectrum ) would exacerbate its tendency to produce excessively massive clusters ( ma 1996 ) .",
    "there are certainly limitations to our numerical modeling .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulation studied in this _",
    "letter _ , for example , does not include formation of molecular clouds or stars , which would reduce the amount of atomic hydrogen available to produce absorption ( fall & pei 1993 ; kauffmann & charlot 1994 ) .",
    "however , including star formation and feedback with the simple algorithm described by katz et al .",
    "( 1996a ) reduces @xmath2 only at @xmath102 @xmath5 ( gardner et al .",
    "the @xmath3 obtained from systems with @xmath103 @xmath5 therefore may not be much reduced by the process of star formation at @xmath104 .",
    "there are additional uncertainties associated with the finite resolution of the simulations , as discussed in previous sections .",
    "the treesph simulation , for example , only resolves gas cooling in halos with @xmath105 .",
    "gardner et al .",
    "( 1997a ) use a combination of numerical and analytic techniques to estimate that absorption by halos with @xmath106 increases the incidence of dla absorption in the cdm model by about a factor of two .",
    "unless the appropriate resolution corrections are much larger for the cdm+hdm model considered here , they will not be nearly sufficient to erase the discrepancy with the storrie - lombardi et al .",
