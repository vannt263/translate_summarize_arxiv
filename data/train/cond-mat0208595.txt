    "one of the central questions in the theory of strongly correlated electrons is the nature of the ground state and of low energy excitations .",
    "experiments in many novel materials with correlated electrons @xcite reveal even in the normal metallic state striking deviations from the usual fermi - liquid universality as given by the phenomenological landau theory involving quasiparticles ( qp ) as the well defined fermionic excitations even in the presence of coulomb interactions .",
    "the focus has been and still remains on superconducting cuprates where there exists now an abundant and consistent experimental evidence for very anomalous low - energy properties @xcite , besides the most evident open question of the origin of the high-@xmath2 superconductivity .",
    "in particular , the attention in the last decade has been increasingly devoted to the underdoped cuprates , where experiments reveal characteristic pseudogap temperatures , which show up crossovers where particular properties change quantitatively . as schematically",
    "presented in fig .  1 , there seems to be an indication for two crossover scales @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the existence of both is still widely debated , in particular whether both could be a manifestation of the same underlying mechanism .",
    "nevertheless we refer to them ( as usually in the literature ) as the ( larger ) pseudogap scale @xmath3 and the spin - gap scale @xmath4 for the lower one .",
    "the @xmath3 scale @xcite shows up clearly as the maximum of the spin susceptibility @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the in - plane resistivity @xmath6 is linear @xmath7 for @xmath8 and decreases more steeply for @xmath9 .",
    "the same @xmath3 appears in the anomalous @xmath10-dependence of the hall constant @xmath11 for @xmath9 @xcite . for the theoretical considerations the most straightforward signature of pseudogap is the reduction of the specific heat coefficient @xmath12 below @xmath13 in the underdoped cuprates @xcite .",
    "namely , within normal fermi liquids @xmath14 directly measures the quasiparticle ( qp ) density of states .",
    "the spin - gap crossover @xmath4 has been identified in connection with the decrease of the nmr relaxation rate @xmath15 for @xmath16 @xcite , related to the reduction of low - energy spin excitations .",
    "even more striking is the observation of the leading - edge shift @xcite in the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements at @xmath17 , a feature interpreted as a @xmath18-wave sc gap persisting within the normal phase .",
    "it seems to some extent plausible that the @xmath3 crossover is related to the onset of short - range antiferromagnetic ( afm ) correlations for @xmath9 , since @xmath19 in an undoped afm has a maximum at @xmath20 the temperature corresponding to a gradual transition from a disordered paramagnet to the one with short - range afm correlations . in this contribution",
    "we concentrate on our theoretical results which confirm and explain the existence of the pseudogap in the model relevant for cuprates , i.e. the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on a 2d square lattice .",
    "it should be however pointed out that there there are also several alternative theoretical proposals , which do not directly invoke afm spin correlations .",
    "the single - particle spectral function @xmath21 and its properties are of crucial importance , since their full knowledge would essentially clarify most open questions concerning the anomalous character of strongly correlated electron systems . in recent years there has been an impressive progress in arpes experiments @xcite ( in particular for cuprate materials ) which in principle yield a direct information on @xmath21 . in most investigated bi@xmath22sr@xmath22cacu@xmath22o@xmath23 ( bscco )",
    "@xcite arpes shows quite a well defined large fermi surface ( fs ) in the overdoped and optimally doped samples at @xmath17 , whereby the low - energy behavior with increasing doping in the overdoped regime qualitatively approaches ( but does not in fact reach ) that of the normal fermi - liquid with underdamped quasiparticle ( qp ) excitations . on the other hand , in the underdoped bscco",
    "qp dispersing through the fermi surface ( fs ) are resolved by arpes only in parts of the large fs , in particular along the nodal @xmath24-@xmath25 direction @xcite , indicating that the rest of the large fs is truncated @xcite , i.e. either fully or effectively gaped . at the same time near",
    "the @xmath26 momentum arpes reveals a hump at @xmath27  mev @xcite , which is consistent with large pseudogap scale @xmath3 .",
    "spectral properties for la@xmath28sr@xmath29cu@xmath22o@xmath30 ( lsco ) , as revealed by arpes @xcite appear to some extent different from bscco , presumably due to the crucial role of stripe structures in the lsco in the regime of intermediate doping . still they again reveal a truncated fs at low - doping and even the existence of qp along the nodal direction .    the prototype single - band model relevant for cuprates which takes explicitly into account strong correlations is the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , derived originally by chao , spaek and ole ' s @xcite @xmath31 where fermionic operators are projected ones not allowing for the double occupancy of sites , i.e. , @xmath32 longer range hopping appears to be important for the proper description of spectral function in cuprates , in particular it is invoked to explain the difference between electron - doped and hole - doped materials both in the shape of the fs at optimum doping materials @xcite as well as for the explanation of the arpes of undoped insulators @xcite , we consider besides @xmath33 for the n.n .",
    "hopping also @xmath34 for the n.n.n .",
    "hopping on a square lattice .",
    "note that @xmath35 for the hole - doped cuprates .",
    "there have been so far numerous theoretical studies of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model on square lattice and related hubbard model at large coulomb repulsion @xmath36 , as relevant to cuprates , using both analytical approaches as well as numerical techniques for finite size systems .",
    "still analytical approximations to spectral properties have proved to be very delicate , in particular with respect to the question of the emerging pseudogap at lower doping .",
    "so there are much fewer studies which give some answers on latter questions within microscopic models close to cuprates .",
    "the importance of afm spin correlations for the emergence of the ( large ) pseudogap is found in the numerical studies @xcite and in phenomenological model studies @xcite .",
    "the renormalization group studies of the hubbard model @xcite also reveal the instability of the normal fermi liquid close to the half - filled band ( insulator ) and a possible truncation of the fermi surface .    in the following we describe some evidence for the pseudogap within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model obtained via finite - size studies and a novel approach to spectral functions using the method of equations of motion .",
    "we introduced some years ago a numerical method , i.e. the finite - temperature lanczos method ( ftlm ) @xcite , which is particularly useful for studying finite - size model systems of correlated electrons at @xmath37 .",
    "the technical advantage of the method is that it is comparable in efficiency to ground state calculations .",
    "@xmath37 results for static and dynamical quantities are of interest in themselves , allowing to follow the @xmath10-variation of properties whereby some of them are meaningful only at @xmath37 , e.g. the entropy , the specific heat , the d.c.resistivity etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the usage of finite but small @xmath37 represents a proper approach to more reliable ground state calculations in small systems .    the most straightforward evidence for a pseudogap within the planar @xmath0-@xmath1 model allowing the comparison with experiments appears in the uniform static spin - suceptibility @xmath38 @xcite . results for various hole concentrations @xmath39 in a system with @xmath40 sites are presented in fig .",
    "it is evident that the maximum @xmath3 being related to the afm exchange @xmath41 in an undoped afm gradually shifts down with doping and finally disappears at critical @xmath42 .",
    "obtained results are qualitatively as well as quantitatively consistent with experiments in cuprates , e.g. lsco @xcite .     at various @xmath43 for hole doping : a ) @xmath44 and b ) @xmath45 . , scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "another quantity relevant for comparison with the analytical approach further on is the single - particle density of states ( dos ) @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "we present in fig .  3 numerical results for dos @xcite as a function of @xmath10 for systems with @xmath47 sites and two lowest nonzero meaningful hole concentrations @xmath48 .",
    "at smallest @xmath49 there is a pronounced pseudogap at @xmath50 which closes with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "this again indicates the relation of this pseudogap with the afm short - range correlations which dissolve for @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the pseudogap closes also on increasing doping since it becomes barely visible at @xmath53 .",
    "in our analytical approach we analyze the electron green s function directly for projected fermionic operators @xcite , @xmath54 which is equivalent to the usual propagator within the allowed basis states of the model . in the eqm method",
    "@xcite one uses relations for general correlation functions @xmath55 ; b \\rangle \\!\\rangle_\\omega   \\label{eq4}\\ ] ] applying them to the propagator @xmath56 @xcite one can represent the latter in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58,@xmath59 can be expressed in terms of commutators .",
    "it is important to notice that the renormalization @xmath60 is already the consequence of the projected basis , @xmath61 while @xmath59 represents the free propagation emerging from eqm , @xmath62 ,    \\tilde c^{\\dagger}_{{\\bf k } s}\\}_+\\rangle -\\bar \\zeta = -4 \\eta_1 t \\gamma_{\\bf k }    -4 \\eta_2 t ' \\gamma'_{\\bf k } , \\label{eq7}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 and @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",

    "eqm enter in the evaluation of @xmath59 but even more important in @xmath68 .",
    "we express the commutator in variables appropriate for a paramagnetic metallic state with @xmath69 , and we get @xmath70&= & [ ( 1-\\frac { c_e}{2 } ) \\epsilon^0_{\\bf k } - j c_e]\\tilde c_{{\\bf k } s } + \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n } } \\sum_{\\bf q } m_{\\bf k q } \\bigl [ s s^z_{\\bf q } \\tilde c_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf q},s } + s^{\\mp}_{\\bf q } \\tilde c_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf q},-s } - \\frac{1}{2 } \\tilde n_{\\bf q } \\tilde c_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf q } , s}\\bigr ] , \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the bare band energy , @xmath72 and @xmath73 is an effective spin - fermion coupling , @xmath74 one important achievement of the eqm approach is that it naturally leads to an effective coupling ( not directly evident within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model ) between fermionic and spin degrees of freedom , which are essential for proper description of low - energy physics in cuprates .",
    "such a coupling is e.g. assumed in phenomenological models as the spin - fermion model @xcite .",
    "the essential difference in our case is that @xmath73 is strongly dependent on @xmath75 and @xmath76 just in the vicinity of most relevant hot spots .",
    "it is quite helpful observation that in the case of an undoped afm our treatment of @xmath67 and the spectral function reproduces quite successful scba equations @xcite for the green s function of a hole in an afm . if we write eqm in the coordinate space for @xmath77 assuming the n ' eel state as the reference @xmath78 , we get by considering only the @xmath0 term , @xmath79 where we have also formally replaced @xmath80 .",
    "we note the similarity of eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) to the effective spin - holon coupling within the scba approach .",
    "so we can follow the procedure of the evaluation of @xmath81 within the scba in the linearized magnon theory @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the magnon dispersion and @xmath84 is the holon - magnon coupling which in general strong @xmath85 , but vanishes near the afm wavevector @xmath86 .    the advantage of the representation of eqm , eq .",
    "( [ eq11 ] ) , explicitly in spin and fermionic variables is that it allows the generalization to finite doping @xmath87 .",
    "we assume that spin fluctuations remain dominant at the afm wavevector @xmath88 with the characteristic inverse afm correlation length @xmath89 .",
    "the latter seems to be the case for bscco as well as yb@xmath22cu@xmath90o@xmath91 , but not for lsco with pronounced stripe and spin - density structures @xcite . for bscco and ybco",
    "it is sensible to divide the spin fluctuations into two regimes with respect to @xmath92 : a ) for @xmath93 spin fluctuations are paramagnons , they are propagating like magnons and are transverse to the local afm short - range spin .",
    "b ) for @xmath94 spin fluctuations are essentially not propagating modes but critically overdamped so deviations from the long range order are essential .    at finite doping case we therefore generalize ( at @xmath95 ) eq .  ( [ eq19 ] ) into the paramagnon contribution , @xmath96 , \\label{eq22}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 refer to the electron ( @xmath98 ) and hole - part ( @xmath99 ) of the propagator , respectively .",
    "we are dealing in eq .",
    "( [ eq22 ] ) with a strong coupling theory due to @xmath100 and a selfconsistent calculation of @xmath101 is required @xcite . also , resulting @xmath102 and @xmath21 as are at low doping quite asymmetric with respect to @xmath103 , since @xmath104 while @xmath105 .      at @xmath87",
    "the electronic system is in a paramagnetic state without an afm long - range order and besides the paramagnon excitations also the coupling to longitudinal spin fluctuations become crucial .",
    "the latter restore the spin rotation symmetry in a paramagnet and eqm ( [ eq9 ] ) introduce such a spin - symmetric coupling . within a simplest approximation that the dynamics of fermions and spins is independent ,",
    "we get @xmath106 where @xmath107 $ ] and @xmath108 is the dynamical spin susceptibility .",
    "quite analogous treatment has been employed previously in the hubbard model @xcite and more recently within the spin - fermion model @xcite .",
    "if we want to use the analogy with the spin - fermion hamiltonian the effective coupling parameter @xmath109 should satisfy @xmath110 which is in general not the case with the form eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) , therefore we use further on instead the symmetrized coupling @xmath111 in contrast to previous related studies of spin - fermion coupling @xcite , however , @xmath109 is strongly dependent on both @xmath76 and @xmath75 .",
    "it is essential that in the most sensitive parts of the fs , i.e. , along the afm zone boundary ( hot line ) where @xmath112 , the coupling is in fact quite modest determined solely by @xmath1 and @xmath113 .",
    "also , in the regime close to that of quasistatic @xmath114 the simplest and also quite satisfactory approximation is to insert for @xmath115 the unrenormalized @xmath116 @xcite , the latter corresponding in our case to the spectral function without @xmath117 but with @xmath118 .    in the present theory spin susceptibility @xmath114",
    "is taken as an input .",
    "the system is close to the afm instability , so we assume spin fluctuations of the overdamped form @xcite @xmath119 nevertheless , the appearance of the pseudogap and the form of the fs are not strongly sensitive to the particular form of @xmath120 at given characteristic @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "we first establish some characteristic features of the pseudogap and the development of the fs following a simplified analysis .",
    "we note that @xmath101 induces a large incoherent component in the spectral functions at @xmath123 and renormalizes the effective qp band relevant to the behavior at @xmath50 and at the fs @xcite .",
    "it can also lead to a transition of a large fs into a small hole - pocket - like fs at very small @xmath124 .",
    "nevertheless , the pseudogap can appear only via @xmath117 .",
    "therefore we here take into account @xmath101 only via an effective band @xmath125 . the input spectral function for @xmath117 is thus @xmath126 we restrict our discussion to @xmath95 and to the regime of intermediate ( not too small ) doping , where @xmath125 defines a large fs .",
    "the simplest case is the quasi - static and single - mode approximation ( qsa ) which is meaningful if @xmath127 , where we get @xmath128 the spectral function shows in this approximation two branches of @xmath129 , separated by the gap which opens along the afm zone boundary @xmath130 and the relevant ( pseudo)gap scale is @xmath131 @xmath132 does not depend on @xmath0 , but rather on smaller @xmath1 and in particular @xmath113 . for @xmath35",
    "the gap is largest at @xmath26 , consistent with experiments @xcite .",

    ", we present results characteristic for the development of spectral functions varying two most sensitive parameters @xmath121 and @xmath136 , which both simulate the variation with doping , e.g. one can @xmath121 take in accordance with experiments @xcite and numerical results on the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite as @xmath137 .    in fig .",
    "3 we present results for @xmath138 at @xmath95 for a broad range of @xmath139 .",
    "curves in fact display the effective fs determined by the condition @xmath140 . at the same time , intensities @xmath138 correspond to the qp weight @xmath141 at the fs . at very small",
    "@xmath142 we see a small ( hole - pocket ) fs which follows from the qsa , eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "already @xmath143 destroys the shadow side of the pocket , i.e. , the solution @xmath144 on the latter side disappears . on the other hand , in the gap",
    "emerge now qp solutions with very weak @xmath145 which reconnect the fs into a large one .",
    "we are dealing nevertheless with effectively truncated fs with well developed arcs .",
    "the effect of larger @xmath121 is essentially to increase @xmath141 in the gapped region , in particular near @xmath26 .",
    "finally , for large @xmath146 corresponding in cuprates to the optimal doping or overdoping , @xmath141 is essentially only weakly decreasing towards @xmath26 and the fs is well pronounced and concave as naturally expected for @xmath35 .",
    "at @xmath95 for various @xmath121 in one quarter of the brillouin zone.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we note in fig .  4",
    "that except at extreme @xmath147 we get a large fs , whereby in the underdoped regime @xmath148 the qp weight @xmath141 is substantial only within pronounced arcs and very small along the gapped fs where @xmath145 .",
    "still , such a situation corresponds to a fermi liquid , although a very strange one , where qp excitations exist everywhere along the fs and hence determine the low - energy properties of the normal metallic state .",
    "it is quite remarkable to notice that in spite of @xmath145 the qp velocity @xmath149 is not diminished within the pseudogap .",
    "in fact it can be even enhanced , as seen in in fig .  5 where the contour plot of @xmath21 is shown .",
    "again , it is well evident in fig .  5 that qp",
    "is well defined at the fs , while it becomes fuzzy at @xmath150 merging with the solutions @xmath151 , respectively , away from the fs .",
    "the effect of large @xmath149 in the pseudogap , which is essential for the low-@xmath10 thermodynamics , can be only explained with a crucial @xmath75 dependence of @xmath67 . assuming that @xmath75 enters only via @xmath152 we can express @xmath149 renormalization as @xmath153 while @xmath154 in the same case , @xmath155 compensates or even leads to an enhancement of @xmath149 . in the case @xmath156 we get @xmath157 final @xmath149 is therefore not strongly renormalized , since @xmath158 and @xmath159 are of similar order .",
    "furthermore , @xmath149 is enhanced in the parts of fs where @xmath159 is small , in particular near @xmath26 point .",
    "the situation is thus very different from local theories where @xmath160 and the qp velocity is governed only by @xmath141 . in our case",
    "the nonlocal character of @xmath161 is essential in order to properly describe qp within the pseudogap region .     across the fs in the pseudogap regime.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "> from @xmath21 we can calculate the dos @xmath162 . at the fermi energy @xmath50 and low @xmath10 one can express the dos also as ( assuming the existence of qp around the fs ) , @xmath163 the contribution will come mostly from fs arcs near the zone diagonal while the gapped regions near @xmath26 will contribute less due to @xmath164 .",
    "results in fig .",
    "6(a ) show the development of @xmath165 with @xmath121 . as expected the dos decreases with decreasing @xmath121 simulating the approach to an undoped afm .",
    "the dos is measured in cuprates via angle integrated photoemission spectroscopy , e.g. for lsco in @xcite , as well as via the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with these experiments ( showing @xmath165 scaling with doping ) as well as with numerical results on the @xmath0-@xmath1 model @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "it is well possible that within photoemission experiments the matrix elements are essential , so we present in fig .",
    "6(a ) also results weighted by the matrix element @xmath166 , which originates from the interplanar hopping as proposed for the @xmath167-axis conductivity @xcite .",
    "such weighted results show a stronger dependence on doping due to enhanced influence of the pseudogap region near @xmath26 , which could be even closer to experimental findings @xcite . in fig .",
    "6(b ) we show also the average @xmath168 along the fs , as well as the qp dos , defined as @xmath169    the decrease @xmath168 has similar dependence at the dos @xmath170 .",
    "it is however quite important to notice that smaller doping ( decreasing @xmath121 ) leads also to a decrease of @xmath171 .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of the pseudogap also in the specific heat in cuprates @xcite , since @xmath172 .",
    "we note here that such a behavior is not at all evident in the vicinity of a metal - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "namely , in a fermi liquid with ( nearly constant ) large fs one can drive the metal - insulator transition by @xmath173 . within an assumption of a local character @xmath174",
    "this would also lead to @xmath175 and consequently via eq .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) to @xmath176 .",
    "clearly , the essential difference in our case is that within the pseudogap regime @xmath161 is nonlocal , allowing for a large ( not reduced or even enhanced ) velocity within the pseudogap regime , hence a simultaneous decrease of @xmath165 and @xmath171 .",
    "-10truemm    it is also important to understand the role of finite @xmath37 .",
    "the most pronounced effect is on qp in the pseudogap part of the fs .",
    "the main conclusion is that weak qp peak with @xmath145 at @xmath95 , as seen e.g. in fig .  5 , is not just broadened but entirely disappears ( becomes incoherent ) already at very small @xmath177 , e.g. @xmath178 for the situation in fig .  5 .",
    "this can explain the puzzle that arpes experiments in fact do not observe any qp peak near @xmath26 in the underdoped regime at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented our results for spectral functions and the pseudogap within the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , which is the prototype model for strongly correlated electrons and for superconducting cuprates in particular . here",
    "we first comment on the validity of the model and results in a broader perspective of strange metals and materials close to the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the physics of the @xmath0-@xmath1 model at lower doping levels is determined by the interplay between the magnetic exchange ( dominating the undoped afm insulator ) and the itinerant kinetic energy of fermions ( being dominant at least in the overdoped regime ) . since itinerant fermions prefer a ferromagnetic state , the quantum state at the intermediate doping is frustrated , the quantum frustration showing up in large entropy , pronounced spin fluctuations , non - fermi liquid effects etc .",
    "evidently , this is one path towards the metal - insulator transition , but definitely not the only one possible . in this situation ,",
    "fermionic and spin degrees of freedom are coupled but both active and relevant for low - energy properties .",
    "this is just the main content and assumption of the presented theory for spectral functions and the pseudogap .",
    "the eqm approach to dynamical properties seem to be promising since it can treat exactly the constraint which is essential for the physics of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "it has been recently also applied by present authors to the analysis of spin fluctuations and collective magnetic modes at low @xmath10 .",
    "our approximation for the self energy within the eqm approach deals with the normal paramagnetic state and treats the model as a coupled system ( with derived effective coupling ) of fermions with spin fluctuations , where close to the afm ordered state both transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations are important .",
    "other contributions should be considered , e.g. , the coupling to pairing fluctuations , in order to treat the superconducting state .    in this paper",
    "we present only the results of the simplified pseudogap analysis .",
    "the results of full self - consistent treatment are qualitatively similar @xcite . within the present theory",
    "the origin of the pseudogap feature is in the coupling to longitudinal spin fluctuations near the afm wavevector @xmath88 which determine the qp properties in the hot region , i.e. near the afm zone boundary .",
    "the pseudogap opens predominantly in the same region and its extent is dependent on @xmath1 and @xmath113 but not directly on @xmath0 .",
    "evidently the pseudogap bears a similarity to a d - wave - like dependence along the fs ( for @xmath35 ) being largest near the @xmath26 point .",
    "the strength of the pseudogap features depends mainly on @xmath121 .",
    "it is important to note that apart from extremely small @xmath121 we are still dealing with a large fs .",
    "still , at @xmath179 parts of the fs near @xmath180 remain well pronounced while the qp weight within the pseudogap part of the fs are strongly suppressed , in particular near zone corners @xmath26 .",
    "the qp within the pseudogap have small weight @xmath145 but not diminished ( or even enhanced ) @xmath149 , which is the effect of the nonlocal character of @xmath161 .",
    "a consequence is that qp within the pseudogap contribute much less to qp dos @xmath181 .",
    "this could be plausible explanation of a well known theoretical challenge that approaching the magnetic insulator both dos , i.e. @xmath165 and @xmath171 vanish .",
    "we presented results for @xmath95 , however the extention to @xmath37 is straightforward .",
    "discussing only the effect on the pseudogap , we notice that it is mainly affected by @xmath121 .",
    "so we can argue that the pseudogap should be observable for @xmath182 .",
    "this effectively determines the crossover temperature @xmath183 . in the region of interest",
    "@xmath121 is nearly linear in both @xmath10 and @xmath184 so we would get approximately @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 .    as described in previous sections , several features of our theory , regarding the development of spectral functions , fermi surface and pseudogap , are at least qualitatively consistent with experimental results of normal state properties in cuprates . however , further study within the present formalism is necessary in order to explore possible closer quantitative agreement with experiments as well as the emergence of superconductivity within the same model .    for a review",

    "<S> the theoretical investigation of spectral functions and pseudogap in systems with strongly correlated electrons is discussed , with the emphasis on the single - band @xmath0-@xmath1 model as relevant for superconducting cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> the evidence for the pseudogap features from numerical studies of the model is presented . </S>",
    "<S> one of the promising methods to study spectral functions is the method of equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> the latter can deal systematically with the local constraints and projected fermion operators inherent for strongly correlated electrons . in the evaluation of the self energy the decoupling of spin and single - particle fluctuations </S>",
    "<S> is performed . in an undoped antiferromagnet </S>",
    "<S> the method reproduces the selfconsistent born approximation ( scba ) . for finite doping </S>",
    "<S> the approximation evolves into a paramagnon contribution which retains large incoherent contribution in the hole part . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of longer - range spin fluctuations is essential for the emergence of the pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the latter shows up at low doping in the effective truncation of the large fermi surface , reduced electron density of states and at the same time reduced quasiparticle density of states at the fermi level . </S>"
