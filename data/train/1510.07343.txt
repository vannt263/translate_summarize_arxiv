    "owing to recent progress in nanotechnology and materials science , nano- and micro - mechanics  @xcite have emerged as subjects of great interest due to their potential use in demonstrating macroscopic quantum phenomena , and possible applications in precision measurements , detecting gravitational waves , building filters , signal amplification , as well as switches and logic gates . in particular , on - chip single- or few - phonon devices are ideal candidates for hybrid quantum information processing , due to the ability of phonons to interact and rapidly switch between optical fields and microwave fields  @xcite .",
    "fabrication of high - frequency mechanical resonators  @xcite , demonstration of coherent phonon coupling between nanomechanical resonators  @xcite , ground - state cooling  @xcite , optomechanics ( in microtoroids  @xcite , microspheres  @xcite , microdisks  @xcite , microring  @xcite , photonic crystals  @xcite , doubly- or singly - clamped cantilevers  @xcite , and membranes  @xcite ) have opened new directions  @xcite and provided new tools to control and manipulate phonons in on - chip devices .",
    "one possible obstacle to further develop this field is the ability to control the flow of phonons , allowing transport in one direction but not the opposite direction  @xcite , i.e. , nonreciprocal phonon transport .",
    "there have been several attempts to fabricate nonreciprocal devices for phonons  @xcite , but these are almost exclusively based on asymmetric linear structures which indeed can not break lorentz reciprocity : a static linear structure can not break reciprocity  @xcite .",
    "these proposed linear structures do obey the reflection - transmission reciprocity and thus can not be considered as  phonon diodes \" .",
    "diode - like behavior was observed in these linear acoustic structures because the input - output channels were not properly switched  @xcite .",
    "nonreciprocal phonon transmission inevitably requires magneto - acoustic materials , strong nonlinearity , or a time - dependent modulation of the parameters of a structure .",
    "although already demonstrated in optics  @xcite , the time - dependent modulation of acoustic parameters of a phononic structure has not been probed yet .",
    "magneto - acoustic materials require high magnetic fields to operate and have been studied  @xcite ; however , a magnetic - free nonreciprocal device is critical for building on - chip and small - scale phononic processors and circuits .",
    "nonlinearity - based nonreciprocity seems to be the most viable approach for creating micro- or nano - scale nonreciprocal devices for controlling and manipulating phonons .",
    "recently , there have been several reports on nonlinear mechanical structures and materials  @xcite",
    ". however , the weak nonlinearity of those acoustic / phononic materials hinders progress in this direction due to the high input powers required to observe the nonlinear effects  @xcite . in order to circumvent this problem , coupling a weakly nonlinear structure to an auxiliary system , such as a quantum bit  @xcite , has been proposed to engineer effective giant mechanical nonlinearities .    in order to achieve the required nonlinearity for nonreciprocal phonon transport and to study nonlinear phononics , here",
    "we introduce a new method based on parity - time ( @xmath0 ) symmetry  @xcite , which has attracted much attention recently due to their interesting and generally counter - intuitive physics  @xcite . parity - time symmetry and its breaking ( broken @xmath0-phase ) have been demonstrated in various physical systems  @xcite , such as optical waveguides  @xcite , microcavities  @xcite , and electrical circuits  @xcite .",
    "however , mechanical @xmath0-symmetric systems have only been considered quite recently  @xcite .    in our proposed mechanical @xmath0 symmetric system , a lossy mechanical resonator ( passive resonator ) which has a weak mechanical nonlinearity is coupled to a mechanical resonator with mechanical gain ( active resonator ) that balances the loss of the passive resonator .",
    "the active resonator here works as a dynamical amplifier . in the vicinity of the @xmath0-phase transition",
    ", the weak nonlinearity is first distributed between the mechanically - coupled resonators and then significantly enhanced due to the localization of the mechanical supermodes in the active resonator . in this way , the effective nonlinear kerr coefficient is increased by over three orders of magnitude .",
    "this strong nonlinearity , localized in the active resonator , blocks the phonon transport from the active resonator to the lossy resonator but permits the transport in the opposite direction .    for the experimental realization of the proposed nonlinearity - based phonon diode",
    ", we provide a system in which a mechanical beam with weak mechanical nonlinearity is coupled to another mechanical beam with gain .",
    "we show that this micro - scale system can be switched from a bidirectional transport regime to a unidirectional transport regime , and vice versa , by properly adjusting the detuning between the mechanical frequency of the resonators and the frequency of the driving phononic field , or by varying the amplitude of the input phononic field .",
    "the system we consider here consists of two mechanical resonators , one of which has mechanical loss ( passive resonator ) and weak nonlinearity , and the other has mechanical gain ( active resonator ) but no nonlinearity ( see fig .  [ fig of mechanical pt ] ) .",
    "the mechanical coupling between the resonators is linear and it gives rise to the mechanical supermodes @xmath1 with complex eigenfrequencies @xmath2 given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the mechanical frequency of the solitary mechanical resonators ( i.e. , both resonators are degenerate ) , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote , respectively , the damping rate of the lossy mechanical resonator and the gain rate of the active mechanical resonator , and @xmath8 is the coupling strength between the mechanical modes . when @xmath9 , the system is in the @xmath0-symmetric regime , and the supermodes are non - degenerate with @xmath10 and have the same damping rate @xmath11 ( see figs .  [ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]a and  [ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]b ) . however , when @xmath12 , the system is in the broken-@xmath0-symmetric regime , the supermodes are frequency - degenerate with @xmath13 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]a and  [ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]b ) and have different damping rates @xmath14 at @xmath15 , the two supermodes are degenerate with the same damping rate , indicating a transition between the pt - symmetric regime and the broken - pt - symmetry regime .",
    "this point is generally referred to as the @xmath0-transition point .",
    "it is seen that the two supermodes will be lossless in the @xmath0-symmetric regime if the gain and loss are well - balanced , such that @xmath16 .",
    "let us assume that the passive resonator is made from a nonlinear acoustic material  @xcite with a small nonlinear kerr coefficient @xmath17 .",
    "this nonlinearity mediates a cross - kerr interaction between the two mechanical supermodes , which leads to the effective nonlinear coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in the broken- and unbroken-@xmath0 regimes  @xcite : @xmath20 clearly , the effective nonlinear coefficients are significantly enhanced in the vicinity of the phase transition point @xmath15 . moreover ,",
    "if the gain and loss are well - balanced , i.e. , @xmath16 , the supermodes become almost lossless .",
    "this observation is one of the key contributions of this paper .",
    "namely , operating the system of two coupled mechanical resonators in the vicinity of the phase transition point will significantly enhance the existing very weak nonlinearity with an extremely small loss rate .    using the parameter values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity ] the evolution of the eigenfrequencies of the system and of the nonlinear coefficient as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "the transition from the broken- to the unbroken-@xmath0 symmetric regime and vice versa , as the mechanical coupling strength is varied , is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]a and [ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]b and it is reflected in the bifurcations of the supermode frequencies and damping rates .",
    "moreover , the enhancement of the nonlinearity in the vicinity of the @xmath0-phase transition point is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig of amplifying mechanical nonlinearity]c .",
    "we find that the nonlinear coefficient is enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the transition point .",
    "more interestingly , in the broken-@xmath0 regime , the mechanical energy of the coupled system is localized in the active resonator , which leads to a nonlinear mechanical mode with strong self - kerr nonlinearity localized in the active mechanical resonator .",
    "this can be interpreted intuitively as follows .",
    "the initial weak mechanical nonlinearity is transferred from the passive resonator to the active resonator and it is enhanced by field localization in the broken-@xmath0 regime . owing to the presence of the mechanical gain , the active resonator then enjoys an almost lossless mechanical mode with a giant nonlinearity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of nonlinearity transfer ] ) .",
    "finally , we would like to consider how the mechanical nonlinearity will affect the @xmath0-symmetric structure of the system . generally speaking",
    ", a strong nonlinearity will shift the transition point of a @xmath0-symmetric system or even destroy the @xmath0 symmetry of such a system  @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , we start from a system in which a gain resonator is coupled to a lossy resonator with very weak kerr nonlinearity , and thus we can omit the shift of the @xmath0-transition point induced by such a weak nonlinearity .",
    "although we generate a strong nonlinearity in the vicinity of the @xmath0-transition point , this is an effective nonlinearity induced in the supermode picture and thus will not affect the supermodes and the @xmath0-transition point of the system .",
    "here we investigate the effect of the enhanced mechanical nonlinearity on the phonon transport in the coupled system .",
    "we find that the localized strong mechanical nonlinearity leads to unidirectional phonon transport from the passive resonator to the active resonator and blocks phonon transport in the opposite direction ( i.e. , phonon transport from the active to the passive resonator is prevented ) .",
    "the transport is almost lossless due to the gain - loss balance of the system .",
    "when this system is operated in the vicinity of the @xmath0-phase transition point , the unidirectional phonon transport is possible within a region given by  @xcite @xmath25,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the detuning between the input ( driving ) field frequency @xmath27 and the resonance frequency @xmath4 of the mechanical resonators .",
    "additionally , in order to observe the unidirectional phonon transport , the amplitude of the input field should satisfy @xmath28,\\ ] ] implying that the intensity of the input field required for unidirectional transport is inversely proportional to the strength of the mechanical nonlinearity @xmath18 .",
    "since the strength of the mechanical nonlinearity can be enhanced by more than three orders of magnitude by breaking the @xmath0 symmetry , the threshold of the input - field intensity for observing unidirectional phonon transport can be decreased by at least three orders of magnitude , allowing a low - threshold phonon diode operation .    to show unidirectional phonon transport in the broken-@xmath0 regime ,",
    "let us first fix the amplitude of the input field and vary the detuning @xmath29 .",
    "we compare the amplitude transmittance @xmath30 and @xmath31 the former , @xmath32 , denotes the transmission from the passive to the active resonator , that is , the system is driven by a phononic input field @xmath33 of frequency @xmath27 at the passive resonator side and the output @xmath34 is measured at the active resonator side .",
    "however , the latter , @xmath35 , denotes the amplitude transmittance from the active resonator to the passive resonator when the system is driven by the field @xmath36 of frequency @xmath27 at the active resonator side and the output @xmath37 is measured at the passive side .",
    "the nonlinearity in the system manifests as a bistability and hysteresis in the power transmittance , @xmath38 and @xmath39 obtained as the detuning @xmath29 is up - scanned from smaller to larger detuning and down - scanned from larger to smaller detuning ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]a ) .",
    "we find that during the down - scan , both of the transmittances @xmath40 and @xmath41 stay at the lower branch with values close to zero until @xmath42 , after which they bifurcate from each other only slightly and then jump to the stable points at the upper branch of their respective trajectories ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]a ) .",
    "further decreasing the detuning leads to an increase in @xmath40 , but a decrease in @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that there is no unidirectional phonon transport with the parameter values used in the numerical simulations .",
    "instead , when the detuning is below a critical value , the phonon transport is bidirectional ; whereas when it is above that critical value there is no phonon transport .    during the up - scan , however , after a short stay on the stable state , i.e. , a regime in which there is no bistability and hysteresis in the transmittance , ( during which @xmath43 decreases and @xmath41 increases with growing detuning ) , both of the transmittances follow the upper branches of their trajectories , during which a linear increase in @xmath41 and a slow - rate decrease in @xmath43 are observed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]a ) .",
    "this behavior continues until @xmath44 for @xmath41 , where it jumps to the lower branch of its trajectory , and becomes zero as the detuning is increased ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]a ) .",
    "this implies that phonon transport from the active mechanical resonator to the passive one is prevented if the detuning is set to @xmath45 .",
    "the transmittance @xmath40 stays at its upper branch with a value close to one until @xmath46 , where it jumps to its lower branch and becomes zero .",
    "thus , for @xmath47 , phonon transport from the passive to the active resonator is prevented .",
    "clearly , in the detuning region @xmath48 , the transmittance @xmath40 is close to one whereas @xmath41 is close to zero in this detuning region phonon transport from the active mechanical resonator to the passive one is forbidden , whereas phonon transport from the passive mechanical resonator to active one is allowed with almost no loss .",
    "thus , we conclude that phonon transmission is non - reciprocal in this detuning region , and the rectification is @xmath49 db within the nonreciprocal transport region ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]a ) . for detuning values smaller than the lower bound of this region",
    ", phonon transport is bidirectional . for detuning values larger than the upper bound of the region ,",
    "phonon transport is not possible .",
    "note that our phonon diode should work only when the disturbance and perturbation of the system parameters are not too strong .",
    "in fact , within the unidirectional phonon transport window shown in fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]a , the transmittance @xmath40 has two different branches of metastable values .",
    "when we increase the detuning @xmath29 within this unidirectional phonon transport window , @xmath40 will stay in the upper stable branch if we do not severely disturb the system and the phonon diode should operate properly .",
    "however , if the disturbance is too strong , @xmath40 will jump from the upper branch to the lower branch and stay in this stable lower branch , without rectification .",
    "alternatively , we can fix the detuning and vary the amplitude of the input field to show the nonlinearity - induced bistability and hysteresis .",
    "a nonreciprocal phonon transport region is seen when the amplitude of the input field is up - scanned ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]b ) .",
    "the nonreciprocal transport region disappears when the amplitude of the input field is down - scanned . within the nonreciprocal transport region , when the input is varied at fixed detuning ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]b ) , the rectification is @xmath49 db . similarly , in this case , due to the metastability of the transmittance @xmath40 , the disturbance - induced perturbation of the system parameters may not be too strong otherwise our design of phonon diode will be invalid .",
    "the unidirectional phonon transport enabled by the @xmath0-breaking - induced strong mechanical nonlinearity can be used to fabricate lossless phonon diodes in on - chip systems .",
    "this may have many applications , such as single - phonon transistors and routers , on - chip quantum switches , and information - processing components .",
    "one possible way to realize the proposed phonon diode is to use coupled beams and cantilevers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of experimental setup]a ) .",
    "phonon lasing , and hence an active mechanical resonator , has been experimentally realized in an electromechanical beam  @xcite .",
    "elastically - coupled nano beams and cantilevers , by which the mechanical supermodes can be generated , have also been shown in various experiments  @xcite , in which the two mechanical resonators can be independently driven  @xcite .",
    "thus our proposal is within the reach of current experimental techniques of nano - micro - electromechanical systems .",
    "let us now consider the design of the phonon diode system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig of experimental setup ] in which a lossy vibrating beam with damping rate @xmath6 and a weak kerr nonlinearity  @xcite of strength @xmath17 is elastically coupled to another vibrating beam with gain @xmath7  @xcite .",

    "[ fig of the power spectrum ] , we present the numerical results performed with the system parameters : @xmath50 khz , @xmath51 khz , @xmath52 khz , @xmath53 khz , @xmath54 khz , and @xmath55 khz . here",
    ", we fix the detuning @xmath29 and change the amplitude of the input field .",
    "there is a @xmath56 db background noise which includes the combined effect of the thermal noise on the mechanical resonators , the electrical noises induced by the measurement apparatus and other possible sources of noise .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig of the power spectrum ] for the phonon diode agree well with the general model discussed in the previous section .",
    "when the amplitude of the input field is increased , it is clearly seen that there is a nonreciprocal region in which phonon transport from the active beam to the passive beam is almost completely suppressed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of the power spectrum]b(ii ) ) , but phonon transport from the passive beam to the active beam is allowed ( see fig .  [ fig of the power spectrum]a(ii ) ) . a rectification ratio of about @xmath57 db is obtained . when the amplitude of the phonon excitation is larger than the upper bound of the unidirectional phonon transport region , the transport is bidirectional . in this case",
    ", the phonons can freely move from the active beam to the passive beam and vice versa ( see figs .",
    "[ fig of the power spectrum]a(i ) and [ fig of the power spectrum]b(i ) ) . finally , for amplitudes of the phonon excitation smaller than the lower bound of the region , no phonon transport can take place between the resonators ( see figs .",
    "[ fig of the power spectrum]a(iii ) and [ fig of the power spectrum]b(iii ) ) .",
    "these are the result of hysteresis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig of unidirectional phonon transport]b ) caused by the strong mechanical nonlinearity .",
    "we have proposed a method to generate ultra - strong mechanical nonlinearity with a very low - loss rate using a @xmath0-symmetric mechanical structure in which a mechanical resonator with gain but no nonlinearity is coupled to a lossy ( i.e. , passive mechanical loss and no gain ) mechanical resonator with very weak nonlinearity .",
    "we have showed that the weak mechanical nonlinearity is redistributed in the supermodes of the coupled mechanical system and is enhanced ( by more than three orders of magnitude ) when the mechanical @xmath0 system enters the broken-@xmath0 regime . moreover , owing to the presence of the mechanical gain in one of the resonators to compensate the mechanical loss of the other resonator , the effective mechanical damping rate is decreased in the @xmath0-symmetric system .",
    "using experimentally accessible parameter values , we identified the regimes where unidirectional phonon transport is possible from the passive to active resonator but not in the opposite direction .",
    "we then proposed an experimentally - realizable system where a mechanical beam with passive loss and weak nonlinearity is coupled to another beam which acts like an active mechanical resonator .",
    "a possible bottleneck for this design to achieve a phonon diode operated in ambient condition is whether the mechanical gain observed with the mechanical beams in a controlled environment and at low temperatures  @xcite could also be obtained in ambient - temperature conditions .",
    "a possible way to overcome this problem , and to realize phonon diodes in ambient conditions , is to use a hybrid system composed of a gain optomechanical resonator and an nonlinear electrically - driven mechanical beam  @xcite , where the coupling between them is achieved via the evanescent optical field of the optomechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "the mechanical gain of the optomechanical resonators can be provided at ambient conditions by , e.g. , the optomechanical dynamical instability in the blue detuning regime  @xcite , which has been demonstrated in optomechanical resonators in various experiments  @xcite . since creating strongly - nonlinear mechanical or acoustic materials remains challenging , we believe that the proposed system and the developed approach provide a suitable platform for investigating nonlinear phononics and can be used as a building block to design more complex hybrid optomechanical or electromechanical information processors .",
    "we envision that @xmath0 mechanical systems will open a new route for designing functional phononic systems with nonreciprocal phonon responses .",
