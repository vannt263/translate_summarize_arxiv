    "the large - scale structure of the universe , mapped by large galaxy surveys , is one of the principal tools for testing the physical laws on cosmological scales ; in particular the unknown nature of the ` dark energy ' which appears to dominate today s universe . the pattern of the galaxy distribution is sensitive to the matter and energy constituents of the universe , the cosmic expansion history , and the gravitational physics which amplifies the initial density seeds into today s web of structure .",
    "however , it is also affected by processes for which there currently exists no complete model : the non - linear gravitational evolution of structure beyond perturbation theory , redshift - space distortions due to galaxy peculiar velocities , and galaxy bias , which describes the complex astrophysical manner in which the observed galaxy distribution traces the underlying mass .",
    "the major challenge for cosmological analyses of large - scale structure is to extract robust information about the underlying cosmological quantities in the presence of the poorly - modelled non - linear or astrophysical effects .",
    "for example , one of the most important methods for obtaining robust cosmological information from large - scale structure surveys is to use the baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) encoded in the clustering pattern as a standard ruler to map out the cosmic expansion history ( eisenstein , hu & tegmark 1998 , blake & glazebrook 2003 , seo & eisenstein 2003 ) .",
    "this technique exploits a preferred length scale imprinted in the clustering of galaxies , a late - time signature of the sound waves which propagated in the pre - recombination universe ( peebles & yu 1970 , sunyaev & zeldovitch 1970 , hu & sugiyama 1996 ) .",
    "this preferred scale , accurately calibrated by measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , may be extracted from the galaxy survey observations in a manner which is independent of any other details of the clustering pattern ( e.g. , anderson et al .",
    "this is an attractive approach because the general clustering pattern is subject to the non - linear and astrophysical distortions mentioned above ( e.g.  eisenstein , seo & white 2007 , smith , scoccimarro & sheth 2008 , seo et al .",
    "2008 ) , which may be harder to model .",
    "however , seen from another viewpoint , this ` model - independent ' technique excludes information which may in principle be used to improve cosmological constraints .",
    "the bao standard - ruler method has now been applied to a number of galaxy surveys to map out the cosmic expansion history across a wide range of redshifts ( e.g.  eisenstein et al .",
    "2005 , percival et al .",
    "2010 , blake et al .",
    "2011c , beutler et al .",
    "2011 , anderson et al .",
    "2012 , busca et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the measurement of baos is an example of the use of 2-point clustering statistics , such as the correlation function or power spectrum , which are almost ubiquitous for testing cosmological models using galaxy surveys .",
    "however , the 2-point statistics do not describe all of the information contained in the cosmological density field .",
    "lacking any sensitivity to the phases of the underlying density fourier modes , they specifically filter out the direct morphological information which is most striking in any visual examination of the ` cosmic web ' : its filamentary nature of inter - connected voids , walls and nodes . indeed , two completely different spatial patterns could display the same 2-point correlation function ( e.g.  martinez et al .",
    "a more complete description of the information can make use of a hierarchy of correlation functions , but these are cumbersome to implement beyond the 3-point function , and modelling their non - linear evolution presents difficulties .    a less - studied but promising alternative approach for extracting information from large - scale structure surveys is to quantify the topological statistics of the cosmological density field . in this study",
    "we focus on the minkowski functionals ( mecke , buchert & wagner 1994 ) , a set of statistics supplied by integral geometry for the complete morphological specification of spatial patterns .",
    "the minkowski functionals are computed from a density field , following smoothing by a gaussian filter , by considering the topological nature of the surfaces formed by each isodensity threshold . in particular , for each surface , the four minkowski functionals describe the volume enclosed , surface area , curvature and ` connectivity ' ( formally defined by either the euler characteristic or genus statistic ) .",
    "we note that a number of alternative topological approaches exist for quantifying large - scale structure such as studies of cosmic voids ( lavaux & wandelt 2012 ) , wavelet analysis ( martinez , paredes & saar 1993 ) , minimal spanning trees ( barrow , bhavsar & sonoda 1985 ) , and multiscale morphology filters ( aragon - calvo , van de weygaert & jones 2010 ) .",
    "topological statistics are worth exploring as a test of cosmological models because they may be robust against some of the systematic non - linear processes which are typically difficult to model in the correlation functions ( melott , weinberg & gott 1988 , matsubara 2003 , park & kim 2010 ) . in particular ,",
    "any process which modifies the density field , preserving the rank - ordering of density from its initial state , will not affect the topology of isodensity contours enclosing a given fraction of volume ( gott , melott & dickinson 1986 ) ; nor does the continuous deformation of a structure affect its topological connectedness .",
    "as such , the minkowski functionals are completely unaffected by linear structure growth and local , monotonic , non - linear galaxy bias .",
    "moreover they are only very weakly distorted by non - linear gravitational evolution and redshift - space distortions ( matsubara 1994 , matsubara & yokoyama 1996 ) . in summary ,",
    "the topology of the density field in co - moving space is exactly conserved over time during linear evolution , and non - linear corrections remain small for scales @xmath1 mpc .",
    "indeed , we determine that the most important systematic modelling issue in our analysis is not non - linear evolution , but the ` sparse - sampling ' distortions arising when the smoothing scale of the gaussian filter is comparable to the mean inter - galaxy separation ( james 2012 ) .",
    "we also note that , even if the initial density statistics were significantly non - gaussian , the topological statistics would nonetheless be conserved during linear evolution .",
    "the pattern of matter overdensities today reflects the distribution of ` seeds ' from which they were formed .",
    "if this initial distribution constituted a gaussian random field as assumed in this study , predicted by simple models of inflation , and supported by observations of the cmb , then the minkowski functionals of the smoothed density field have simple analytic forms . in this case",
    "the dependence of the functionals on the isodensity threshold @xmath4 is a known function of @xmath4 , regardless of the power spectrum of the field , with an unknown overall normalization that only depends on the shape of the underlying power spectrum at the smoothing scale .",
    "if the shape of this power spectrum is known , then theory predicts each of the minkowski functionals , independently of the normalization of the underlying power spectrum .",
    "a measurement of the minkowski functional amplitudes is then sensitive to the cosmic distance - redshift relation in two ways , which allow a ` standard ruler ' technique to be applied ( park & kim 2010 , zunckel , gott & lunnan 2011 ) .",
    "first , the distance - redshift relation determines the physical length - scales mapped by the survey , and hence the amplitudes of the minkowski functionals in dimensional units .",
    "secondly , the smoothing scale applied when filtering the density field in order to perform these measurements assumes a fiducial distance - redshift relation , and selects a scale in the underlying model power spectrum to which the measurements are sensitive . for a power - law power spectrum",
    "these two effects are precisely degenerate , yielding no sensitivity of the minkowski functional amplitudes to the distance scale .",
    "however , if the underlying power spectrum possesses a curvature which is accurately known , for example using models fit to cmb observations , then this curvature may be used as a standard ruler to match the smoothing scale which has been applied to the data . for a narrow redshift slice @xmath5 of a galaxy survey ,",
    "the resulting observable is the ` volume - weighted ' distance @xmath2 , identical to the quantity measured by bao surveys using the angle - averaged correlation function .",
    "the aim of our study is to measure these topological statistics using data from the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) , which is one of the largest existing large - scale structure surveys , and provides a uniquely - long redshift baseline ( @xmath0 ) for testing the cosmological model .",
    "we use the minkowski functional amplitudes to measure the distance - redshift relation @xmath2 and compare the result to analyses using baos ( blake et al .",
    "2011c ) , validating our techniques using mock galaxy catalogues from n - body simulations .",
    "in comparison to previous analyses which have focused on measuring just one of the minkowski functionals , the genus statistic , from the sloan digital sky survey ( gott et al .",
    "2009 , choi et al .",
    "2010 ) or from large n - body simulations ( kim et al .",
    "2011 ) , we implement some new methodological developments : ( 1 ) we apply a new method of estimating the galaxy density field correcting for the survey selection function ; ( 2 ) we measure and utilize all minkowski functionals rather than just the genus statistic ; ( 3 ) we advocate and apply a study of the _ differential _ minkowski functionals rather than the integral versions , in order to reduce covariance between measurements at different values of @xmath4 ; ( 4 ) we measure this covariance between different density thresholds and functionals , and propagate this information into our cosmological fits ; ( 5 ) we prescribe a method for correcting our measurements for sparse - sampling .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section [ secdata ] we describe the various datasets employed in our analysis , including the wigglez galaxy survey and mock catalogues . in section [ secmink ] we present the minkowski functional measurements and modelling . in section [ secamp ]",
    "we extract the minkowski functional amplitudes and their covariances , to which we fit cosmological models in section [ seccosmo ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ secconc ] .",
    "the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .  2010 ) is a large - scale galaxy redshift survey of bright emission - line galaxies over the redshift range @xmath6 , which was carried out at the anglo - australian telescope between august 2006 and january 2011 . in total , of order @xmath7 redshifts of uv - selected galaxies were obtained , covering of order 1000 deg@xmath8 of equatorial sky . in this study",
    "we analyzed the same final wigglez galaxy sample as utilized by blake et al .",
    "( 2011c ) for the measurements of baos in the galaxy clustering pattern .",
    "after cuts to maximize the contiguity of the observations , the sample contains @xmath9 galaxies divided into six survey regions  the 9-hr , 11-hr , 15-hr , 22-hr , 1-hr and 3-hr regions . the survey selection function within each region was determined using the methods described by blake et al .",
    "( 2010 ) .",
    "we tested our methodology using data from the gigaparsec wigglez ( gigglez ) n - body simulation ( poole et al .  in preparation ) , a @xmath10 particle dark matter simulation run in a @xmath11 gpc box ( with resulting particle mass @xmath12 ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters used for the simulation initial conditions were @xmath13 = [ 0.273 , 0.0456 , 0.96 , 0.705 , 0.812]$ ] .",
    "bound structures were identified using subfind ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) , which uses a friends - of - friends ( fof ) scheme followed by a sub - structure analysis to identify bound overdensities within each fof halo .",
    "we employed each halo s maximum circular velocity @xmath14 as a proxy for mass , and used the centre - of - mass velocities for each halo when introducing redshift - space distortions .    using the gigglez simulation halo catalogues we created one independent , complete realization of the set of six survey regions compromising the wigglez dataset .",
    "we constructed these mock catalogues by first selecting a subset of dark matter haloes spanning a small range of @xmath14 around 125 km / s , chosen to possess a similar clustering amplitude to the wigglez galaxies , and corresponding to halo masses around @xmath15 .",
    "we then subsampled these haloes using the survey selection function in each region to match the observed number of galaxies .",
    "the gigglez mock catalogues were used for testing the cosmological fits to the topological statistics for systematic errors , by checking for any significant deviation between the best - fitting parameters and the input cosmology of the simulation .",
    "for each wigglez survey region we also constructed an ensemble of 400 lognormal realizations using the method described by blake et al .",
    "( 2011b ) .",
    "lognormal realizations , which are poisson - sampled from a density field built from a fiducial power spectrum model , are relatively cheap to generate and provide a reasonably accurate description of 2-point galaxy clustering for the linear and quasi - linear scales important for this analysis .",
    "work is in progress to construct a larger set of n - body simulation mock catalogues for the wigglez survey , although this is a challenging computational problem because the typical dark matter haloes hosting the star - forming galaxies mapped by wigglez have mass @xmath16 , which ( for example ) is about @xmath17 times lower in mass than a luminous red galaxy sample .",
    "the lognormal catalogues were subsampled using the survey selection function in each region to match the observed number of galaxies .",
    "they were used for determining the covariance matrix of the topological statistics at different density thresholds and the sparse - sampling correction , both described in more detail below .",
    "the cosmological density field of each dataset was constructed from the galaxy point distribution by smoothing with a gaussian filter . in the smoothing process we must also correct for the effect of the varying survey selection function @xmath18 with position @xmath19 .",
    "we introduce here a modification to the reconstruction method used in previous studies ( e.g.  vogeley et al .",
    "1994 , james et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the previously existing methodology may be summarized as follows : i ) each galaxy within the data sample ( @xmath20 ) is weighted with the value @xmath21 and placed in a ( padded ) three - dimensional array using a nearest - grid - point binning ; ii ) these data are smoothed with a gaussian ( @xmath22 ) of standard deviation @xmath23 ; iii ) the systematically - lower density near the survey boundaries induced by the smoothing is characterized by smoothing an array ( @xmath24 ) that has constant value inside the survey volume and zero outside ; iv ) finally , the smoothed @xmath20 field is taken in ratio with the smoothed @xmath24 field , after which topology of structure within the resulting field can be studied .",
    "formally , this process may be written : @xmath25 / [ c \\otimes g ] , \\ ] ] where @xmath26 is used to denote convolution .",
    "the alternative that we propose and implement here is : i ) do not weight the galaxies initially and instead smooth the galaxy counts in cells @xmath20 as they are ; ii ) instead of creating a comparator field of constant value inside the survey region , weight the constant field by the selection function @xmath27 ; iii ) smooth this weighted comparator field , which again is used in ratio with the smoothed data . in the notation described immediately above , this process may be summarized as : @xmath28 / [ ( c \\times w ) \\otimes g ] .\\ ] ] the motivation for the latter scheme is to apply the selection function to the data in a smoother and more global way , rather than locally at the site of each galaxy . in this sense",
    ", it is closer in spirit to the methodology used for correlation function estimation .",
    "these two schemes are identical in the limit that the selection function does not vary over the scale of the smoothing volume .",
    "figure [ figisodens ] shows two isodensity surfaces within the reconstructed density field of the wigglez survey 15-hr region for the redshift range @xmath29 , using a gaussian smoothing scale @xmath30 mpc .",
    "the isodensity values have been chosen so as to excise the highest and lowest density fifths of the field by volume , and the surfaces display the relative disconnectedness of structure that is expected for regions this far removed from the median density .",
    "the apparent uniformity of the topology of the structure with redshift relies on an accurate correction of the effects of the survey selection function , and the smoothness of the structures themselves is determined by the choice of filter .",
    "this work studies the topology of large - scale structure using the four minkowski functionals of ( the boundary surface of ) excursion sets cut from the density field .",
    "an excursion set is constructed from the smoothed density field by choosing a critical density threshold ( @xmath31 ) ; regions of density above this value are identified as being within the surface .",
    "the minkowski functionals , which we computed by the algebraic means described in appendix a , are identified geometrically with the enclosed volume , surface area , curvature and genus of the excursion set boundary surface .",
    "hadwiger s theorem yields the result that these four statistics form a complete geometric description of the salient properties of the surface ( see chen 2004 for a recent review ) .",
    "minkowski functionals have been explored in the context of cosmology by several authors for almost two decades ( early analyses include mecke et al .  1994 ,",
    "kerscher et al .",
    "1997 , schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) .",
    "for convenience we remap the density threshold parameter @xmath31 to a variable @xmath32 which is defined such that the fraction of volume @xmath33 enclosed by a given isodensity surface is @xmath34 this step ensures that the first minkowski functional  the enclosed volume  is identically an error function irrespective of the structure of the density field .",
    "consequently it is the three remaining functionals , which we studied as a function of @xmath4 , that possess dispositive statistical power in the analysis .",
    "this density transformation is equivalent to the gaussianisation process of weinberg ( 1992 ) employed in studies of reconstructing the linear - regime power spectrum ( neyrinck , szapudi & szalay 2011 ) @xmath35 .\\ ] ] this transformation maps the one - point density distribution @xmath36 of the field to that of the normal distribution with mean @xmath37 and standard deviation @xmath38 , preserving the ordering of regions from highest to lowest .",
    "it is also very similar to the lognormal transformation , given that the cosmological density field obeys a lognormal distribution even to the smallest scales we study in this work ( coles & jones 1991 , taylor & watts 2000 , watts & taylor 2001 ) .    the parameter @xmath4 indexes the surfaces drawn through the density field .",
    "the first two useful minkowski functionals describe the area and curvature of these surfaces .",
    "there is less immediate geometric intuition for the final functional : the total connectedness , or genus statistic @xmath39 .",
    "it is defined as the arithmetic difference between the total number of holes through the filamentary structure and its total number of disjoint components , @xmath40 the natural interpretation in the context of the cosmological density field is that the genus number measures how connected ( when @xmath41 ) or disjoint ( @xmath42 ) regions of a given density tend to be .",
    "its numerical calculation often occurs indirectly via the computation of the total gaussian curvature of the surface , a differential geometric technique introduced by weinberg , gott & melott ( 1987 ) . in this work",
    "we compute an equivalent statistic , the euler characteristic [ @xmath43 , as the final minkowski functional .",
    "the cosmological density field may be approximated , when filtered at certain scales , as a gaussian random field .",
    "the theory of the statistics of excursion sets of such fields has been studied by many authors in contexts of cosmology and geometric statistics ( doroshkevich 1970 ; adler 1981 ; bardeen et al .",

    "although in practice we always evaluate the exact integrals of equation [ eqsigsq ] , we note that the function @xmath64 , which weights the power spectrum in the integrals , peaks at wavenumber @xmath65 , and hence equation [ eqsigsq ] approximately represents the ratio of two power spectrum amplitudes evaluated at scales @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( i.e.  between two wavenumbers in a fixed ratio near @xmath66 ) : @xmath68^{n/2 } , \\label{eqampapprox}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a constant . in other words",

    "we found that the scatter amongst the best fits was comparable to the error in the fit to the real 15-hr region dataset ( indeed , the scatter in the simulation results was a little smaller , likely owing to the fact that the realizations are not truly independent , given that they have been carved from the same simulation ) .    secondly , we demonstrate that the error in the fitted distance scale can be successfully estimated by propagating the error in the fitted minkowski functional amplitudes .",

    "for example , error propagation for the measurements with @xmath212 mpc smoothing scale predicts errors in @xmath72 in the range @xmath213 for the three minkowski functionals ; when combined with appropriate covariance and added to the ( noisier ) measurements for larger smoothing scales , the result is consistent with the final @xmath194 distance error .",
    "we have presented the first measurements of the cosmic distance scale using the topology of the galaxy density field as a standard cosmological ruler .",
    "if the shape of the underlying galaxy power spectrum is known , then the minkowski functionals are prescribed via the statistics of the excursion sets of a gaussian random field .",
    "corrections due to non - gaussian processes are small : the topological statistics are independent of any local , monotonic , non - linear galaxy bias and , for the smoothing scales considered in this analysis , are only weakly distorted by non - linear gravitational evolution and redshift - space distortions . as such , the topology of the density field in co - moving space is exactly conserved during linear evolution and , given the standard ruler provided by the known curvature of the underlying power spectrum , may be used to determine the same composite distance @xmath2 that is probed using baryon acoustic oscillations .",

    "we validated our methodology using mock catalogues sampled from an n - body simulation , which match both the selection function and large - scale clustering of the wigglez survey data , demonstrating that the fiducial cosmology of the simulation is recovered ( within the statistical error of the analysis ) .",
    "when analyzed in broad overlapping redshift ranges @xmath214 , the resulting distance - scale measurements from the wigglez survey have errors in the range @xmath215 .",
    "these determinations agree with , and are almost twice as precise as , previous measurements from the same dataset using baryon acoustic oscillations as a standard ruler .",
    "we used arguments based on dividing the total dataset into sub - regions , and computing direct error propagation between the minkowski functional amplitudes and distance scale , to increase confidence in the correctness of these errors .",
    "the topological analysis requires more assumptions , since the full shape of the underlying power spectrum determines the gaussian - field statistics .",
    "we describe this degeneracy by also providing measurements of the well - constrained combination @xmath216 , with errors in the range @xmath217 . when analyzed in six narrow , independent redshift slices in the range @xmath0 , the resulting measurements of @xmath2 have errors in the range @xmath218 , and agree with the existing set of bao distance - scale measurements from other galaxy surveys , and with standard flat @xmath107cdm cosmological models .",

    "we describe an implementation of an algorithm to measure the minkowski functionals at density thresholds @xmath219 on data with non - periodic boundaries , as is the case for survey data that has been smoothed and corrected for selection effects .",
    "similar enterprises have been discussed in works two decades past ( e.g.  coles & plionis 1991 , coles et al .",
    "1996 ) , though our approach is novel .",
    "our routine blends the contour3d algorithm of weinberg ( 1988 ) with the integral geometric method for computing the functionals on smoothed fields , detailed by schmalzing & buchert ( 1997 ) . starting from a three - dimensional array , it sums the contribution to the four minkowski functionals at each array node , where the contribution for each cell configuration about a node is retrieved from a pre - computed table .",
    "the notable distinction with respect to previous implementations is that the cell configurations now admit 3 values for a cell , corresponding to the cell being above the threshold , below the threshold and not in the survey region .",
    "this section describes how the look - up tables for contributions to the minkowski functionals are computed , how the cell configurations are indexed and how the thresholding and summation is carried out .",
    "we validated our code using tests on a gaussian random field generated from the wigglez survey galaxy power spectrum , including selection functions .",
    "the theoretical necessity of an attentive study of boundaries can be understood from the gauss - bonnet theorem .",
    "let @xmath220 be a two - dimensional surface separating regions above and below the threshold , and @xmath221 be the interface between this surface and regions outside the survey .",
    "then the euler characteristic @xmath222 , the fourth minkowski functional , can be evaluated in relation to the gaussian curvature @xmath223 of the surface and the geodetic curvature @xmath224 along the boundary : @xmath225 the importance of the boundary term is that , when the surface is closed , the second integral vanishes and the euler characteristic is interpreted geometrically as the genus of the surface ( @xmath226 ) . however , in the case of survey data it is not possible to assert that the surface is closed ",
    "one has no knowledge of the field outside the survey boundary .",
    "the integral geometric algorithm for computing the minkowski functionals computes the left - hand side of this equation , incorporating the boundary term .",
    "this produces incorrect results for the surface area , curvature and euler characteristic functionals , a simple demonstration of which is the limit where all of the survey region is above the density threshold : there are no interfaces between regions above and below the threshold , so the minkowski functionals should have values @xmath227",
    "= @xmath228 ; yet if the computation includes the boundary term , the latter three functionals will all be non - zero .",
    "inevitably , the boundary term must be subtracted , allowing the functionals to achieve their natural interpretations as volume , area , curvature and genus and to match the theoretical formulae for these quantities that have been developed to date .",
    "this is achieved on - the - fly by requiring that the contributions to the minkowski functionals at each node be altered in the presence of boundaries , which in turn mandates that this implementation operate on a ternary , rather than binary , threshold array .      to discover how such a computation can be carried out ,",
    "it is necessary to return to the fundamentals of minkowski functional measurement on smoothed fields in cosmology , explicated most fully in the dissertation of jens schmalzing and summarized in his papers thereafter ( schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) .",
    "crofton s 1868 formula for evaluating the length of a curve by counting its intersections with straight lines drawn through the plane can be extended to the surface in three dimensions .",
    "this casts the computation of these functionals as an integral over the intersections between the threshold surface and all possible hyperplanes .",
    "when the threshold surface is embedded in an array , however , the hyperplanes are those parallel to the lattice , so that the computation of the geometric properties of the surface is reduced to combinatorics of the point , line , surface and cube components of the cells within it .    in the absence of a survey boundary ,",
    "the threshold surface defines a binary array of cells above and below the critical density . identifying the cells above the threshold as those composing the volume",
    ", the total number of unique vertices @xmath229 , edges @xmath230 , faces @xmath231 and cubes @xmath232 within this volume , including those on its surface , are counted to give the minkowski functionals ( schmalzing & buchert 1997 ) @xmath233 here , @xmath234 is the physical length scale of an individual cell and @xmath235 the physical volume of the field ( i.e. , @xmath236 , where @xmath237 is the number of cells in the array ) , so that the minkowski functionals @xmath238 are all expressed in physical units and as a fraction of the total volume of the field .",
    "the totals @xmath239 are evaluated by summing the local contribution @xmath240 at each node across the whole array .",
    "this reduces the computation of the minkowski functionals to a counting problem and remains valid even in the presence of survey boundaries .",
    "the crucial change when such a boundary is present is that the weight assigned to a cell component at the survey interface is reduced . to discover the manner in which this occurs , consider the case where the survey volume consists of a single cell of unit size , above the threshold density , surrounded entirely by unit cells outside the survey volume",
    "once again , by geometric argument the minkowski functionals of this survey region are @xmath227 = @xmath228 , yet equations ( a1 ) ",
    "( a4 ) will return @xmath241    this is resolved by reducing the contribution of a cell component to the count @xmath240 from @xmath242 to @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is the number of cells outside the survey boundary with which the cell component is in contact . in this particular case , each vertex will now contribute @xmath245 , each edge @xmath246 and each face @xmath247 .",
    "when the adjacent cells are not all outside the survey region , these weightings can take other integer multiples of @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 ( between 0 and 1 ) for vertices , edges and faces respectively .",
    "it would not be uncharitable to characterize as incomplete our understanding of why this reweighting scheme succeeds .",
    "some further clarifying examples will be provided in the sections below , after the numerical indexing scheme is described .",
    "computing the number of cell components @xmath240 comprising the thresholded region , without double counting , can be achieved by indexing each component uniquely to an array node .",
    "an arbitrary node within the array is surrounded by eight cells , of which one is assigned to that node ; twelve faces , of which three are assigned to that node ; six edges , of which three are assigned to that node ; and one vertex , the node itself .",
    "this configuration is demonstrated in figure [ figindexing ] .",
    "this means that each node can contribute @xmath251 vertices , @xmath252 edges , @xmath253 faces and @xmath254 cubes to each of the totals @xmath240 .    a @xmath255 ternary array , @xmath256 @xmath257 = 1 \\right ) \\times \\big ( 1-\\tfrac{1}{8 } \\sigma ( a[:,:,:]=2 ) \\big)$ ] @xmath258 = 1 \\right ) \\times \\big ( 1-\\tfrac{1}{4 } \\sigma ( a[1,:,:]=2 ) \\big ) + \\textrm{prms.}$ ] @xmath259 = 1 \\right ) \\times \\big ( 1-\\tfrac{1}{2 } \\sigma ( a[1,1,:]=2 ) \\big ) + \\textrm{prms.}$ ] @xmath260 = 1\\right)$ ]    given this specification , algorithm [ algnodecount ] evaluates the number of vertices , edges , face and cubes , with proper weightings for survey boundaries , at an individual node . in this notation , `",

    "some examples may demonstrate this computation more clearly .",
    "consider the arrangement shown in figure [ figindexing ] , assuming that the shaded cell is above the threshold and all others are both in the survey region and below the threshold .",
    "the contributions @xmath240 at this node will be @xmath268 . two trickier configurations ( numbers 1380 and 3647 in the sequence of @xmath269 ) are shown in figure [ figexconfs ] .",

    "ternary labelling system , where cells within the survey region and below the threshold are set to 0 , those above the threshold to 1 and those outside the survey region to 2 .",
    "there are , therefore , @xmath269 possible configurations for the cell values about each node , which are enumerated by the following extension of the weinberg ( 1988 ) scheme : @xmath270 where @xmath271 is shorthand for the value of the corresponding cell within the @xmath255 block surrounding the node . in the following we refer to this as a function idx mapping a @xmath272 cell configuration to an index @xmath273 . the cell @xmath274 is identified with shaded cube in figure [ figindexing ] .      to speed up evaluation of the total counts @xmath239 across the array , a lookup table is used .",
