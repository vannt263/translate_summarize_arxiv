    "translocation of protons over long distances has a key importance for biological and chemical systems .",
    "it is believed that proton migration along the chains of water molecules formed between the interior of proteins and the solvent , establishes electrochemical potential gradients playing an important functional role @xcite .",
    "experimental evidence indicates that the dominant mechanism responsible for proton transport in transmembrane proteins ( for instance , in bacteriorhodopsin of _ halobacterium halobium _ @xcite and in gramicidin a channels @xcite ) is the diffusion of h@xmath0 ions which is faster than the hydrodynamic flow of hydronium species ( h@xmath1o)@xmath0 . especially at low hydrogen concentrations in channels , proton conduction is determined by a two - stage grotthuss - type mechanism @xcite shown schematically in fig .",
    "the first stage involves the intrabond proton tunnelling along the hydrogen bridge which is connected with the formation and transfer of ionic positive ( h@xmath1o@xmath0 ) and negative ( oh@xmath2 ) charged defects . to sustain a flux of h@xmath0 in such proton wire",
    ", the inter - molecular proton transfer due to the reorientations of molecular group with proton is assumed .",
    "reorientation motion leads to the breaking of the hydrogen bond ( so - called orientational bjerrum l - defect ) and location of proton between another pair of molecular groups @xcite .",
    "consequently , the reorientation step in the presence of the second proton may induce high - energy configuration with both of the protons shared by two adjacent oxygen ions ( bjerrum d - defect ) .",
    "unlike the translocation of monovalent ions like cs@xmath0 , na@xmath0 or k@xmath0 via gramicidin requiring the net diffusion of the whole water column in the channel , the existence of the grotthuss - type selective migration of h@xmath0 through the h - bonded chain is supported by the absence of streaming potentials during h@xmath0 permeation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the bulk water , the reorientation motion in one - dimensional water wire involving a migration of bjerrum defects with the period of reorientations about @xmath3  s , is much slower than the proton intra - bond hopping ( @xmath4  s)@xcite .",
    "this is also closely related to the fact that the mobility of bjerrum defects ( @xmath5 @xmath6v@xmath7s@xmath7 ) is much lower than that of the ionic defects ( @xmath8 @xmath6v@xmath7s@xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , as appears from the results of molecular dynamics simulations @xcite , the translocation of the ionic defects in proton wires is almost activationless process , whereas the orientation defects involving an activation energy of about 5  kcal / mol in the chain containing eight water molecules , constitute a limiting step for the proton migration .",
    "besides the orientation defects , the recent experiments indicate that another possible rate - limiting step for the proton migration in gramicidin channels can be at the membrane - channel / solution interface@xcite .",
    "as was pointed in @xcite , the experimental analysis of the proton flow in bioenergetic proteins and the mechanism of proton translocation is very difficult because of its intrinsically transient nature . to shed more light on the microscopic nature of the proton transport and to analyze the influence of quantum effects and interaction with proton surrounding , theoretical",
    "modeling remains to be essentially important .",
    "recently , much attention has been focused on the theoretical studies of the dynamics of ionic defects using soliton models @xcite and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "proton transfer in water was shown to be strongly coupled with the dynamics of local environment , and the density of ionic defects was found to increase exponentially with the increasing temperature@xcite . however , since the concentration of slow bjerrum defects in water solutions is much higher ( @xmath9 at @xmath10  c ) than that of fast ionic ( @xmath11)@xcite , the investigations of the reorientation step of proton migration are necessary for the better understanding of the proton transport process .",
    "the goal of the present work is to study proton wire containing a finite number of water molecules by the use of quantum statistical mechanics methods which are extremely effective in the description of the collective nature of the proton transfer and in the quantum treatment of the light h nuclei @xcite . to describe correctly the proton transport process",
    ", we employ here two - stage proton transport model @xcite incorporating quantum effects such as proton tunneling and zero - point vibration energy . in earlier papers",
    "@xcite we applied the two - stage model to analyze the effect of coupling between protons and molecular group vibrations on proton conductivity in infinite h - bonded chains and proton - conducting planes .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the proton - lattice vibration interactions induce structural instabilities and charge ordering in system @xcite , whereas the grotthuss - type transport mechanism manifests itself in nontrivial temperature- and frequency dependences of the proton conductivity @xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze the influence of proton - proton correlations , comparing two different protonated chains containing one and two excess protons respectively .",
    "we find that the reaction of protonation of water chain is extremely sensitive to the reorientation energy barrier of proton motion and the barrier for the chain protonation .",
    "we show that the increase of the reorientation energy results in the drastic decrease of the proton charge density at the boundary between the chain and surrounding with consequent localization of protons near the inner water molecules . as appears from our modeling , the application of external electric field induces the step - like threshold - type effects with the ordering of proton charge and stabilization of bjerrum d - defects in the wire .",
    "we analyze the temperature dependence of proton polarization and d - defect concentration , and examine the role of the interplay between different factors ( such as orientation energy , external field and temperature ) in the dynamics of bjerrum defects .",
    "to model a proton wire , we consider a linear chain containing @xmath12 hydrogen bonds and @xmath13 molecular groups .",
    "the outer left ( @xmath14 ) and right ( @xmath15 ) molecular complexes mimic the surrounding of the proton wire and differ from the inner ( @xmath16 ) water molecules .",
    "the transport of an excess proton through the wire proceeds via the following two steps : + ( i ) proton can be transferred within a h - bond ( process shown by short arrows in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) which is modelled by a simple double - well potential , with the corresponding energy barrier @xmath17 for the proton transfer between the two minima : @xmath18 where @xmath19(@xmath20 ) are the operators of the proton creation(annihilation ) in the position ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) ( the index @xmath23 denotes the left / right position for the proton within the h - bond ) ; + ( ii ) a water molecule together with covalently bonded hydrogen ion can be rotated , and this process causes the breaking of the h - bond and location of h@xmath0 between two another nearest water molecules of the wire ( process depicted by long arrows in fig .",
    "1(a ) ) : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the effective energy barrier for the proton hopping between the states @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( reorientation of the @xmath21-th molecular group together with proton ) .",
    "as is shown in @xcite by the computation of the proton mean - force potential , this transition between donor - acceptor and acceptor - donor states reverses the chain dipole moment and requires a substantial energy barrier about @xmath28  kcal / mol for the whole chain containing up to eight water molecules .    besides the transport process , we incorporate the following two types of interactions between protons in the chain : + ( iii ) different short - range configurations of the protons near an inner water molecule as well as an outer molecular group can appear due to the different nature of bonding ( shorter covalent or longer h - bond )",
    ". the energies of possible configurations ( shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) are described by the following terms : @xmath29 the parts @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe the energies of the boundary proton configurations near the left and the right surrounding molecular groups ( we assume for simplicity @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the boundary configurations shown in the upper scheme of fig .",
    "the terms @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) contain the configuration energies for the water molecules in the interior of the wire ( the lower part in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . here",
    "the proton occupancy operators @xmath36 ; + ( iv ) a strong repulsion between two nearest protons shared by two neighboring oxygens ( so called bjerrum d - defect ) with a repulsion energy @xmath37 is represented by the term : @xmath38 in our following analysis we use the value of @xmath39  kcal / mol corresponding to the energy of relaxed @xmath40-defect estimated in @xcite on the basis of quantum chemical calculations .    to model a field exerted by the surrounding , we apply an external electric field of a strength @xmath41 to the proton wire , which is described by the following term @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the coordinate of the proton position ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) with respect to the center of the chain , and @xmath44 denotes the proton charge .    in order to analyze the dynamics of the proton wire embedded in the surrounding under the influence of the field , as well as the effect of rotational motions of covalent groups with proton",
    ", we will focus our attention on the polarization of the proton wire defined here as @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the statistical average with respect to the system energy ( [ h_t]-[h_e ] ) .",
    "the average probabilities @xmath47 of occupation of the position ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) by proton describe the distribution of the proton charge in the wire , and thus is another very important characteristics to track the proton migration .    to calculate _ exactly _ the above - mentioned statistical averages , we need to know the quantum energy levels determined by the energy ( [ h_t]-[h_e ] )",
    ". this can be done by a mapping of the proton states ( @xmath21,@xmath22 ) on the multi - site basis @xmath48 .",
    "then , using the projection operators @xmath49 acting on the new basis @xmath50 we rewrite the system energy ( [ h_t]-[h_e ] ) in a convenient form ( see appendix ) : @xmath51 each term @xmath52 in ( [ ham ] ) corresponds exactly to @xmath53 protons in the chain ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this means in fact that the mapping on the states @xmath50 allows to decompose the terms ( [ h_t]-[h_e ] ) and analyze the cases of different number of protons in the wire separately .",
    "the energy barrier for the protonation of the chain is described by the parameter @xmath55 which appears in ( [ ham ] ) after the decomposition procedure ( see appendix ) . as follows from the definition ( [ delta ] ) , @xmath55 is the difference between the energies of the proton attraction to the boundary and to the inner water molecules . as the pmf - studies of the h - bonded chain dynamics @xcite",
    "show that the inner h - bonds are stronger ( shorter o - o separation distances ) than the outer h - bonds , it is reasonable to consider below the case @xmath56 ( we take @xmath57  kcal / mol in our numerical calculations ) , when the proton is attracted to the surrounding and needs to overcome the boundary energy barrier @xmath58 to protonate the water chain .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "1(b ) ) is related to the effective short - range interactions between the protons near the water molecule .",
    "it describes , in fact , the energy of the formation of the pair of ionic defects : i@xmath60=h@xmath1o@xmath0 ( @xmath61 ) and i@xmath62=oh@xmath2 ( @xmath63 ) from two water molecules at the dissociation reaction ( 2h@xmath64o @xmath65 h@xmath1o@xmath0+oh@xmath2 ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath66 is about @xmath67  kcal / mol @xcite and is more than twice as much as @xmath37 , we exclude in our following analysis an appearance of the pair of ionic defects in the system .",
    "due to the two types of motions we have two different contributions to the proton dipole moment : the orientational part @xmath68 and the transfer part @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the distance h - h between the two nearest proton positions of the double - well h - bond . in our calculations",
    ", we use the values @xmath71  d and @xmath72  d corresponding to the moderately strong h - bond with an o - o distance @xmath73 and the covalent o - h bond of a length @xmath74 .",
    "as the starting point , in this section we mimic the situation when one proton is moved towards the water chain embedded into the solvent . to examine the behavior of the protonated chain with @xmath12 h - bonds and @xmath75 excess proton",
    ", we consider @xmath76 part of the energy given by ( [ ham_decomp ] ) .",
    "since the zero - point vibration energy for protonated chains is larger than the potential energy barrier for the proton transfer between two shared oxygens @xcite , the quantum tunneling is not required for the intra - bond h@xmath0 transfer .",
    "thus , in our modelling we set @xmath77 . with this assumption",
    ", the energy levels of @xmath76 can be found _ exactly _ : @xmath78 where @xmath79 .    to analyze the role of @xmath25 we consider first the case without external field ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath25 , two different regimes may be stabilized in the system . in the first _ small-@xmath25 regime _ , the two lowest energy levels @xmath81 correspond to the superposition of the two boundary states @xmath82 with the proton located in the surrounding near the left or the right outer molecular groups . in the second _ large-@xmath25 regime _",
    "the proton is shared between the inner water molecules of the chain and the ground state of the system corresponds to the superposition of the states @xmath83 with the energies @xmath84 .",
    "the `` critical '' value @xmath85 separating these two regimes , reflects the transition of the proton from the surrounding to the states where the proton is shared by the chain water molecules , which corresponds to the protonation chemical reaction .",
    "2 shows the variation of the average occupancies of proton sites with @xmath25 for the chains containing @xmath86 and @xmath87 h - bonds . for low temperatures ( see the case @xmath88 ) the boundary proton occupancies @xmath89 drop drastically to zero at @xmath90 , whereas the occupation numbers of the central positions @xmath91 increase up to the value @xmath92 , reflecting the redistribution of collectivized proton between the inner sites in the wire .",
    "it should be noted here that @xmath93 reflects the change of the ground state of the system and is determined as the solution of the equation @xmath94 at @xmath80 which does not depend on temperature .",
    "however , as all statistical averages , the average proton occupancies ( for example , of the states @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the diagonalized states corresponding to @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively ) , are temperature dependent .",
    "thus the value of @xmath101 where @xmath102 , for @xmath103 is not equal to @xmath93 ( see fig .  2 , case @xmath104 ) .",
    "this difference shows that the inner proton states ( [ inner ] ) are stabilized already at lower @xmath105 , although the occupancies of the inner positions at @xmath90 are still slightly lower then of the outer due to the temperature - induced fluctuations . as @xmath106 , the fluctuations decrease and @xmath107 .",
    "the effect of the proton localization inside the chain is supported by the results reported in @xcite showing that in h - bonded finite chains , the excess charge is best solvated by the central h - bonds . however , as results from the presented above analysis , the effect of proton localization is drastically influenced by the competition between two different tendencies : ( i ) for small @xmath25 , the proton is located near the surrounding / wire interface due to the nonzero protonation barrier @xmath55 ; ( ii ) to overcome the barrier between the surrounding and the wire , the reorientation energy should be sufficiently large ( @xmath108 ) in order to stabilize the inner proton configurations .",
    "these conclusions show that in general , these two different factors ( interface barrier and orientations ) can be rate - limiting for the charge translocation and proton conductivity of the wire .",
    "as was shown in @xcite , the effective reorientation barrier can be influenced by temperature factor or applied voltage ( for example , the reorientation rate of the wire decreases exponentially with @xmath109 decrease ) .",
    "thus , one can also expect that the increase of the temperature can result in the lower orientation barrier @xmath25 , delocalization of proton and consequently in higher values for the proton conductivity through the channel . however , more detailed theoretical analysis is needed to understand better the role of the interface in the behavior of the conductivity .",
    "we turn now to an analysis of the proton translocation directed by the external field ( the case @xmath110 ) .",
    "3 shows the field - dependences of @xmath111 and @xmath47 for the chain containing @xmath86 h - bonds .",
    "we note that the behavior in the first small- and in the second large-@xmath25 regime differs drastically . in the small-@xmath25 regime",
    "the polarization increases smoothly with @xmath41 approaching finally its maximal saturation value @xmath112 ( fig .",
    "3(a ) , inset ) .",
    "in contrast to this , in the large-@xmath25 regime the field dependence is rather nontrivial : first , for @xmath113 , @xmath111 changes very slowly , and than , at @xmath114 a strong increase of @xmath111 to @xmath115 is observed in fig .",
    "this rapid step - like change of the proton polarization reflects the threshold - type effect where the threshold electric field value at low @xmath109 is given by @xmath116 and does not depend on the chain size @xmath12 ( @xmath117  v / cm for the chains with @xmath86 as can be observed in fig .",
    "as we see in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the proton charge translocation under the influence of the field in this case proceeds not smoothly , but has a step - like character .",
    "as results from ( [ thresh ] ) , the threshold value @xmath118 ( which is needed to overcome a barrier for pumping between the inner localized states ( [ inner ] ) and the boundary state @xmath119 in the direction of field ) increases for larger @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "3(a ) , the cases with @xmath120  kcal / mol and @xmath121  kcal / mol ) .",
    "this implies that the conductivity of protonated chains can drop with an increasing @xmath25 which can occur in system for example due to the temperature - induced fluctuations of @xmath25 .",
    "however , as was shown in @xcite , the reorientation rate increases at increased voltage , which corresponds in our case to the smaller values of @xmath25 for @xmath110 .",
    "thus , we can expect that the external field - induced lowering of the orientation barrier for the proton translocation results in the increase of the proton conductivity in the wire .",
    "the drastic change of @xmath111 at @xmath122 leads to a strong qualitative difference in the temperature shapes of the polarization profiles shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) for the large-@xmath25 regime . for @xmath113 and @xmath123 ,",
    "the excess proton is located in the central sites , and the increase of @xmath109 results in a disorder - induced transfer of the proton from the inner positions to the chain boundary giving the increase of @xmath111 at @xmath124  k as compared to @xmath125  k ( fig .",
    "4(a ) , cases @xmath126",
    "v / cm and @xmath127  v / cm ) .",
    "as the proton is located in the outer state @xmath128 for @xmath129 ( corresponding to @xmath130 for @xmath106 ) , the dominant effect of @xmath109 in this case is the the disorder - induced proton redistribution between all sites in the chain leading to the lowering of total polarization ( fig .",

    "the profiles of the polarization for @xmath25 below @xmath93 shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) appear to be very similar to the high - field profiles in fig .",
    "since for @xmath133 the proton is located in the outer states ( [ outer ] ) near the chain boundary already at low @xmath41 , the increase of @xmath109 suppresses the polarization due to the increasing proton disorder .",
    "in order to examine the influence of proton correlations , we consider next the translocation of two excess protons in the wire which is described by the part @xmath134 of the total energy ( [ ham_decomp ] ) . since the presence of two protons in wire may lead to the formation of bjerrum d - defect , the energy @xmath134 for the chain with @xmath86 h - bonds given by the expression ( [ ham22 ] ) , contains the terms with the energy @xmath37 of the repulsion between two nearest - neighboring protons .",

    "basically , the essential effect of @xmath109 observed in the @xmath174-profiles in fig .  6 , is the suppression of the total polarization due to proton disorder",
    "however , the shapes of the polarization in fig .",
    "6(a ) are drastically different for @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "for low fields ( @xmath197 ) the polarization first increases ( reflecting the fluctuation - induced expansion of proton charge from the outer symmetric positions @xmath199 with @xmath178 to the inner positions of the chain accompanied by the formation / annihilation of d - defects ) , and then smoothly decreases due to the disorder effect .",
    "in contrast to this , as the increasing electric field induces the step - like formation of d - defects in the small-@xmath25 regime , the temperature behavior of @xmath111 in this case is similar to the the large-@xmath25 case ( compare fig .",
    "6(a ) and fig .",
    "6(b ) with @xmath200  v / cm ) showing the smooth disorder - induced decrease of @xmath111 with @xmath109 .",
    "we also note that the stable configurations with double proton occupancy require the additional reorientation steps for the proton translocation and can result in the smaller values for the proton conductivity .",
    "this fact has been observed in the measurements of the proton conductance in two different stereoisomers of the gramicidin @xcite , thus supporting a possibility of stabilization of the d - defect states in proton wires .",
    "in this work we studied the process of proton translocation in 1d - chains mimicking protonated water channels embedded in surrounding .",
    "we have analyzed the role of the reorientation motion of protons , as well as the effect of electric field and proton correlations on the chain dynamics .",
    "we have shown that the increase of the reorientation energy results in the transition to the large-@xmath25 regime characterized by the transfer of the proton charge from the surrounding to the inner water molecules in the chain .",
    "the process of proton migration along the chain in the external electric field has the step - like character leading to the appearance of the electric field threshold - type phenomena with drastic redistribution of proton charge . the correlations between protons in the chain increase the `` critical '' reorientation energy @xmath93 necessary for the transition into the large-@xmath25 regime , where the protonated chain contains a finite concentration of bjerrum defects .",
    "the temperature fluctuations induce a slight increase of @xmath201 separating the state with the protons located in surrounding near the outer groups , and the protonated state with d - defects . for the correlated chains ,",
    "this temperature dependence of the `` critical '' reorientation energy can lead to the redistribution of proton charge and annihilation of d - defects with increasing @xmath109 .",
    "the electric field applied to the correlated chains induces first the formation of ordered dipole structures for the lower @xmath41 values , and than , with the further @xmath41 increase , the stabilization of the states with the bjerrum d - defects .",
    "generally , the increase of temperature suppresses the total polarization in the chain due to the increasing disorder .",
    "however , especially in the low electric fields , the shapes of the temperature profiles of the polarization appear to be drastically different in the small- and large-@xmath25 regimes demonstrating the complex interplay between the reorientation energy and temperature .    finally , as follows from our analysis",
    ", the following factors strongly influence the formation of bjerrum defects : ( i ) the high electric fields can form the defects and pump them in the chain in the direction of field ; ( ii ) the increase of the orientational energy barrier leads to the stabilization of d - defects ; ( iii ) the increase of temperature in the large-@xmath25 regime results in the formation / annihilation of d - defects , whereas for small @xmath25 the concentration of d - defects significantly increases up to 1 - 2 orders at the room temperatures as compared to the low @xmath202  k.",
    "we demonstrate below the procedure of the mapping in the system with @xmath86 h - bonds on the multi - site states . for @xmath86",
    "the basis @xmath50 includes @xmath203 states @xmath204 : @xmath205 and @xmath206 : @xmath207 where the expectation numbers @xmath208 can be found using the usual antisymmetric rules for fermi - operators @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the case @xmath86 the expressions ( [ ferm_hubb ] ) yield : @xmath209 using the relations ( [ c22 ] ) and the fact that @xmath210 ( due to the orthogonality of the states @xmath50 ) , we decompose ( [ h_t]-[h_e ] ) in terms of @xmath211 operators into the following 5 terms : @xmath212 where @xmath213 @xmath214 @xmath215    since the parameter @xmath216 in ( [ ham21])-([ham23 ] ) is the difference between proton configuration energies at the boundary ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 surrounding molecular groups ) , and at the inner ( @xmath217 ) water molecule , it describes , in fact , the energy barrier for the protonation of the water chain . for our analysis",
    "@xmath55 has the key importance , because the other energy constants in ( [ ham21])-([ham23 ] ) @xmath218 which appear due to the boundary effects , are independent of the proton location in the wire and thus do not influence the statistical characteristics like ( [ pp ] ) ."
