    "the flat spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq )  at redshift @xmath1 is by far the brightest blazar in the @xmath0-ray range during the lifetime of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( _ fermi _ ) . since the start of operation in august 2008",
    "the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) has detected more than hundred thousand photons from this object .",
    "its brightness has been changing by at least two orders of magnitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) : after a bright state in 2008 , the blazar turned to a very low state in the spring of 2009 , then the flux has been gradually increasing .",
    "the bright flares then occurred in november 2009 and april 2010 and the brightest @xmath0-ray flare ever observed from a blazar happened in november 2010 .",
    "the early data from the first 160 days of the _ fermi _ observations have demonstrated a clear spectral break around 2.53 gev @xcite .",
    "similar breaks in the gev range have been observed in several other fsrqs and low - synchrotron peak bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "later works by @xcite and @xcite dedicated to   found the spectral hardness ",
    "flux correlation at a nearly constant break energy .",
    "first interpretations of the breaks invoking the external compton mechanism with a truncated electron spectrum @xcite do not reproduce as sharp a break as observed .",
    "the stability of the break energy favours instead the absorption of the gev photons by the photon - photon ( @xmath2 ) pair production on the and lyman recombination continua ( lyc ) from the broad - line region ( blr ) , as proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ps10 ) .",
    "a relatively high opacity in the lyc observed in a number of bright blazars implies the location of the @xmath0-ray emitting region within the highly ionized inner part of the blr .    motivated by the extremely rich photon statistics from , in the present work we particularly try to answer the following questions :    1 .   is the spectral break consistent with the @xmath2-absorption on the heii lyc at various source fluxes ?",
    "we do not have a freedom of choosing the position of the break , with the only free parameter being the lyc column density .",
    "a good fit at a rich statistics would be a strong argument in favour of the absorption hypothesis .",
    "2 .   is there any correlation between the break sharpness ( i.e. absorption opacity in our interpretation ) and the flux ?",
    "if yes , then this would imply a varying location of the @xmath0-ray emitting region .",
    "what is a proper characterization of the spectrum below the break ? in ps10 the hypothesis for the underlying ( unabsorbed ) spectrum was a power - law .",
    "the underlying spectrum can actually be slightly curved with respect to the power - law .",
    "the light curve of  from the start of the _ fermi _ data records to 2011 april 1 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : lc ] .",
    "we split the data into ten time intervals covering periods of more or less constant flux levels and analyze the spectrum in each interval .",
    "we use our own software for the data analysis because the standard software distributed by the _ fermi _",
    "lat team does not contain the required spectral models .",
    "the energy - dependent exposure function was calculated using the spacecraft pointing history : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the time interval of interest , @xmath5 is the angle between the detector axis and the direction to the object and @xmath6 is the detector effective area at energy @xmath7 .",
    "the spectral models folded with the exposure function are fitted to the observed counts in 13 logarithmically spaced energy bins in the energy range 0.1560 gev .",
    "we included the events of classes 3 and 4 and imposed the cuts at zenith angle @xmath8105@xmath9 .",
    "we used ` p6_v3_diffuse ` version of the response function .",
    "the background was measured in a circle with the radius 6@xmath9 , separated from the object by @xmath1015@xmath9 and avoiding local sources .",
    "we accumulate counts in the circle centered at the source location with the energy - dependent radius @xmath11 ( which corresponds to 95% containment ) .",
    "statistical errors were treated as gaussian , except in a few bins at higher energies , where the number of photons is low , we use poisson likelihood adding @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( here @xmath14 is the number of counts in the bin and @xmath15 is the prediction of the model ) .",
    "the number of such bins is small and the meaning of @xmath13 is not significantly affected . for the minimization we use the standard code minuit from the cern library .",
    "we checked that our software reproduces within statistical errors the results of the _ gtlike _ task for standard spectral models such as power - law and broken power - law ( compare table 2 in ps10 with table 1 in @xcite ) .",

    ", the breaks should appear at 2.6 and 10.3 gev , which is consistent with observations ( @xcite ; ps10 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : all_spe ] ) .",
    "the absorption strength by the isotropic line photons is parameterized by the thomson optical depth ( see ps10 ) : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the photon column density along the line of sight , @xmath37 is the thomson cross - section , @xmath38 is the line luminosity , and @xmath39 is the typical size .",
    "( we defined @xmath40 in cgs units . ) the energy - dependent opacity @xmath41 is obtained by multiplying @xmath42 by the angle - averaged @xmath2 cross - section in units of @xmath37 , which has a maximum of @xmath100.2 at three times the threshold energy ( see @xcite ; ps10 ) .",
    "the opacities produced by two `` lines '' , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , were free parameters .",
    "we see that with the power - law null - hypothesis all spectra have very significant breaks and require non - zero absorption opacities ( column 4 in table [ tab : results ] )",
    ". however , the residual value of @xmath13 is still high for many spectra , especially for the average spectrum corresponding to the entire observational period , mostly because of the spectral curvature below the break .",
    "the simplest way to account for this curvature is to replace the power - law null - hypothesis by the lognormal distribution ( or `` log - parabola '' , which is essentially the same function in a different representation , see @xcite , @xcite ) , which we use in the decimal form @xmath43 the resulting fits are shown in columns 5 ( without absorption ) and 6 ( with da ) of table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we see a significant decrease in @xmath13 compared to the power - law - based models .",
    "the da model gives a substantial reduction in @xmath13 in all cases ( except for interval e ) .",
    "these fits are superior compared to any simple phenomenological model considered earlier ( e.g. lognormal , broken power - law , or an exponentially cutoff power - law , see @xcite ) .",
    "if the spectral break is indeed caused by the @xmath2-absorption on the lyc , its position should be stable .",
    "in that case we can expect that the break should become more significant in the average spectrum corresponding to the whole observation period .",
    "indeed , this is the case , the lognormal distribution without absorption fits the data ( see table [ tab : results ] ) at @xmath44 for 11 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "the da improves the fit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : all_spe](b ) ) , but the residual value @xmath45 is still high . the absorption model for the blr at a fixed ionization parameter @xmath46 ( see ps10 )",
    "gives @xmath47 , with the quality of the fit being better ( @xmath48 ) in the range @xmath815 gev .",
    "the main contribution to the residual @xmath13 comes actually from the high - energy tail of the spectrum and might have a simple interpretation : the absorber optical depth varies during the observation and the sum of the spectra with low and high opacities differs from the spectrum at a fixed intermediate opacity .",
    "the best - fitting value of @xmath20 is nearly constant @xmath493 ( see column 7 of table [ tab : results ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ) , with the interval e being again an outlier . in order to avoid extra statistical noise",
    ", we fix @xmath50 and then probe the correlation of other parameters with the source brightness ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "we find a highly significant correlation of the peak energy @xmath27 with flux , which is well represented by a power - law ( fig .",
    "[ fig : epeak ] ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 at 1 gev .",
    "this confirms a previously known hardness  flux correlation @xcite .",
    "we also observe a marginally significant ( 2.5@xmath32 ) anti - correlation between the @xmath2-opacity by the lyc and the flux ( see fig . [",
    "fig : tauhe ] ) : @xmath53 the opacity @xmath29 in the lyc does not vary significantly .",
    "the blrs around quasars emit a number of lines associated with very different ionization stages , with the high - ionization lines being broader @xcite .",
    "reverberation mapping demonstrated a strong anti - correlation between the line width and the time delays of the line response to the continuum variations @xcite .",
    "all this implies strong stratification of the blr that extends over two orders of magnitude in distance @xcite .",
    "the blr size , as measured from the  @xmath541549 line delays , scales with the accretion luminosity as @xmath55 pc @xcite .",
    "however , the delays in the high - ionization heii  @xmath541640 line are 35 times smaller in seyferts @xcite , while the balmer lines give sizes 23 times larger . as the opacity in the gev range depends on the line compactness ( @xmath56 ) ,",
    "models assuming that all lines are produced at the same distance from the central source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , strongly underestimate the @xmath2-opacity by the relatively weak , high - ionization lines produced in a small volume ( if the @xmath0-rays are produced closer to the centre ) and overestimate the opacity for multi - gev photons from the strong , low - ionization lines which are produced much further away than the fiducial distance obtained from .    a high average @xmath0-ray luminosity of  during the last two years with flares up to @xmath57  erg  s@xmath25 @xcite provided an order of magnitude increase in photon statistics compared to the earlier data analysed by @xcite and ps10 . in became even more evident that the spectral breaks at @xmath103 gev are real",
    "the spectra at all fluxes are well described by a lognormal distribution absorbed by the and lyc at 54.4 and 13.6 ev .",
    "the fits with this model are superior compared to the previously used simple phenomenological models , especially at high fluxes with high photon statistics .",
    "the blr size corresponding to the heii and hi lyc can be estimated from equation ( [ eq : taut ] ) : @xmath58 @xcite report the luminosity of  in ly@xmath59 of @xmath60  erg  s@xmath25 and in heii  @xmath541640 of @xmath61  erg  s@xmath25 .",
    "assuming equal luminosities in lyc and ly@xmath59 , the resulting @xmath62 is much larger than the usually quoted sub - pc size of blr , but is consistent with the absence of ly@xmath59 variability in powerful quasars @xcite .",
    "the heii lyc luminosity is probably larger than @xmath63  erg  s@xmath25 , but is model dependent and therefore the estimate of @xmath64 is less certain .",
    "a rather large ratio @xmath65 ( between about 1/4 and 1 ) and the observed @xmath28flux anti - correlation indicate that the @xmath0-ray emission region lies close to the boundary of the heiii zone at @xmath66 and moves out at higher luminosity .",
    "absorption troughs at 0.30.7 gev due to the high - ionization c and o lines are potentially detectable , but require high photon statistics and better calibration of lat .",
    "we note that the typical values of @xmath674 imply that the maximum optical depth due to the heii lyc photons ( at about 7 gev  three times the threshold value of 4.8/@xmath68 gev ) varies around 0.40.8 .",
    "the absorption by lyc is very significant and accurately describes the data in the 315 gev range . at high energies ,",
    "the opacity decreases roughly inversely with the photon energy and becomes negligible above @xmath10300 gev .",
    "the opacity there is dominated by the optical / ir lines which are mostly produced in the low - ionization zone of blr at large distances .",
    "this strongly reduces the opacity and can make the blr transparent for the multi - gev to tev photons .",
    "a probable excess of photons above 15 gev ( especially for the average spectrum ) over the prediction of the model with the best - fitting absorption indicates that the spectrum is a superposition of emission states with different opacities due to the extended or moving emission zone .",
    "this proposal is supported by the spectral variability seen during the latest flare in november 2010 @xcite , where photons above 10 gev mostly arrive at the end of the flare , clearly indicating the position of the @xmath0-ray emitting region further away from the black hole .",
    "our findings that the spectral peak of the underlying continuum strongly correlates with the flux , with the width of the lognormal distribution being roughly constant , indicate a more efficient acceleration at high fluxes . these variations might not be consistent with the interpretation of the spectral curvature as the klein - nishina reduction of the compton scattering efficiency of the ly@xmath59 photons @xcite .",
    "this in turn would imply that the seed photon energy density is not dominated by the hydrogen lyman continuum and line photons ( in the high - ionization zone of the blr the metal lines and the lyman photons are actually more energetically important ) .",
    "alternatively , the steady electron distribution is modified by inefficient cooling in the klein - nishina regime @xcite .",
    "the gev breaks observed in bright blazars still do not answer the question what is the @xmath0-ray production mechanism .",
    "it can be compton scattering of the accretion disc @xcite or blr photons @xcite , or even the synchrotron radiation of relativistic pairs .",
    "the efficient means for particle acceleration can be provided by the photon breeding mechanism @xcite .    a small distance to the beginning of the @xmath0-ray emitting region",
    "is supported by the fast variability observed from  @xcite .",
    "association of the beamed @xmath0-ray emission with a relativistic jet implies that the jet is already accelerated at a sub - parsec distance from the black hole ( i.e. at thousand schwarzschild radii from the @xmath1010@xmath69 black hole , @xcite ) .",
    "this , in turn , argues against the jet launching mechanism by the accretion disc @xcite , with the only known alternative being the extraction of the black hole spin energy by the blandford - znajek process @xcite .",
    "this research was supported by the academy of finland grant 127512 and the magnus ehrnrooth foundation .",
    "the research made use of public data obtained from the fermi science support center .",
