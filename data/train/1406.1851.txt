    "lefschetz thimbles are naturally defined :    assuming that @xmath7 defined as in the last lemma is a morse function on @xmath5 , a cycle is called a lefschetz thimble associated to @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath12 , if all points of it can be reached by the gradient flow of @xmath7 starting from a critical point @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath102 where @xmath103 is a linear space generated by @xmath104 .",
    "clearly , the braiding does not change the dimension of the thimble .",

    "the braiding of the thimble of the generalized yang - yang function with symmetry breaking is @xmath105 where w.c.t represents unknown wall - crossing terms .",
    "see @xcite for more details .",
    "two properties of wall - crossing should be noticed .",
    "first , wall - crossing in the braiding transformation does not create or annihilate any simple root , but only transfers them from one location to another .",
    "we call this property the conservation law of wall - crossing",
    ". if the total types and numbers of the simple roots of two thimbles are different , the yang - yang functions of them are two different functions . from the definition of the braiding of the thimble",
    ", the braiding transformation only appears between the thimbles from one holomorphic function .",
    "thus this property is natural .",
    "second , the transfer of simple roots in the wall - crossing can only be from @xmath64 to @xmath63 .",
    "the gradient flows in the symmetry breaking case are from @xmath63 and @xmath64 to the infinity in the positive direction of the real axis in @xmath106 plane . in our assumption ,",
    "@xmath63 and @xmath64 have the same real part and @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , in the clockwise braiding , the wall - crossing appears when there is a gradient flow started from @xmath64 passing through @xmath63 .",
    "thus the only possible transfer of simple roots is from @xmath64 to @xmath63 .",
    "these two properties tell us that if we choose proper basis , the braiding matrix will be a diagonal partitioned matrix and each block in the diagonal will be a triangular matrix .",
    "thus , they are actually sub - representations of the braiding .",
    "in @xcite , quantum mechanics was used to study knot invariants .",
    "we give a brief review of it in this section .",
    "after the projection on a plane , knots can be decomposed as two strands braiding @xmath107 , its inverse @xmath108 , annihilation @xmath109 , creation @xmath110 and identities , as is shown in figure [ fig : knot ] and figure [ fig : ac ]    decomposition of a link diagram , width=302,height=151 ]    .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the probability amplitude for the concatenation of processes is obtained by summing the products of the amplitudes of the intermediate configurations in the process over all possible internal configurations .",
    "the initial states @xmath111 , intermediate states @xmath112 and final states @xmath113 form vector spaces @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "denote the first process by @xmath117 from the initial state @xmath118 to the intermediate state @xmath119 , then the @xmath117 is a transformation from the @xmath114 to the @xmath115 .",
    "the second process @xmath120 is from the intermediate state @xmath121 to the final state @xmath122 .",
    "then the amplitude of the concatenation processes starts from @xmath118 and ends up with @xmath122 is @xmath123 .",
    "knots can be thought as a process starting from and ending up with a vacuum state with braiding , its inverse , creation , annihilation and identities as intermediate configurations .",
    "thus knot invariants are vacuum expectations of a quantum mechanics system .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : knot ] , the invariant @xmath124 of the knot @xmath125 is @xmath126 where we use einstein notation for summation .",
    "now we focus our attention on the state space and the operators acting on it . to derive knot invariants from a general simple lie algebra ,",
    "we define the state space as the representation space @xmath92 of the finite dimensional irreducible highest weight representation of the simple lie algebra @xmath45 with the highest weight @xmath35 .",
    "then the braiding operator is defined as @xmath127 .",
    "we assume @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , the braiding matrix is an @xmath129 matrix .",
    "annihilation @xmath109 and creation @xmath110,width=226,height=113 ]    annihilator is a function @xmath130 .",
    "it is equivalent to @xmath131 and can be represented as an @xmath132 matrix .",
    "creator is a map @xmath133 .",
    "it can also be represented as an @xmath132 matrix .",
    "we denote the amplitudes for annihilation and creation between two states @xmath134 and @xmath135 as @xmath109 and @xmath110 respectively in figure [ fig : ac ] .",
    "invariance under the topological moves , width=302,height=151 ]    as is shown in figure [ fig : tm ] , to be invariant under the topological moves , they should be inverse to each other : @xmath136 we call the matrix of amplitudes for the annihilation of two strands fusion matrix @xmath137 , then the matrix of amplitudes for the creation of two strands is just its inverse @xmath138 . for representations",
    "@xmath139 and @xmath140 ( @xmath62 ) mentioned above , we define two vectors @xmath141 of weight @xmath142 and @xmath143 of weight @xmath144 in @xmath139 and @xmath140 to be complementary to each other . since only two complementary states can fuse into a vacuum state , fusion amplitudes are nonzero only between two complementary vectors .",
    "then fusion matrix can be written as @xmath145 @xmath146",
    "@xmath0 has @xmath147 simple roots @xmath148 .",
    "cartan matrix of @xmath0 is@xmath149 the highest weight of the fundamental representation @xmath92 of @xmath0 is @xmath150 .",

    "they are @xmath151 , as is shown in figure [ fig : bn ] .",
