    "despite a number of experiments  @xcite and theoretical approaches  @xcite still an open question remains about the mechanism of the @xmath0-meson production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "previous studies concluded that the @xmath0-meson production in @xmath6 and @xmath7 reactions occurs predominantly via the @xmath8 resonance and that the proton-@xmath0 interaction is much larger than in the case of proton-@xmath9 , and proton-@xmath10  @xcite . for an unambiguous understanding of the @xmath0 production process",
    ", relative magnitudes from the partial wave contributions must be well established .",
    "the incompatibility between experiment and theory may be resolved by taking into account higher partial waves and additional baryon resonances  @xcite .",
    "this kind of studies can be performed by measuring analyzing power @xmath2 of the @xmath0-meson . up to now",
    ", measurements of @xmath11 in the @xmath1 reaction were conducted by the cosy-11 and disto collaborations  @xcite .",
    "however , these previous experiments suffered from low statistics and limited geometrical acceptance  @xcite . in order to determine @xmath11 more accurately , the axially symmetric wasa detector  @xcite and the vertically polarized proton beam of cosy have been used to collect a high statistics data sample .",
    "an experiment was conducted for beam momenta 2026 mev / c and 2188 mev / c which correspond to excess energies of 15  mev and 72  mev , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the trigger was set to select events corresponding to the @xmath1 and @xmath12 reactions .",
    "proton - proton elastic scattering provides information for the determination of the polarization and the luminosity .",
    "additionally , to control the effects caused by potential asymmetries in the detector setup the spin orientation was flipped from cycle to cycle .",
    "the first step in the study of the asymetry @xmath11 is the analysis of the reaction @xmath12 .",
    "based on the elastic scattering reaction we have calculated the polarization degree for the whole data sample . in the @xmath14 reaction one of the protons",
    "is registered in the forward detector , with geometrical acceptance of polar angle @xmath15 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 and the second is registered in the central detector . by utilizing @xmath18e -e method in the forward range hodoscope and the angular correlation of the outgoing protons we have selected events corresponding to the proton - proton elastic scattering . for further calculations we have chosen only two @xmath19 ranges in the centre of mass [ @xmath20 and [ @xmath21 , for which @xmath11 is available from edda database  @xcite and for which the number of event statistic was sufficient .",
    "in order to estimate the background , for each bin in @xmath19 , the @xmath22 distribution was fitted separately with a fifth - order polynomial , excluding in the fit the range from 130@xmath23 to 160@xmath23 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ theta1 ] .     vs @xmath22 distribution . ]",
    "subsequently in order to estimate a background each separate @xmath22 distribution was fitted with the fifth polynomial excluding in the fit the range from 130@xmath23 to 160@xmath23 .",
    "example of such distribution can be seen in fig.[theta2 ]     for @xmath24 $ ] , @xmath25 $ ] and spin mode .",
    "points denote data .",
    "the green line corresponds to the fitted background , and the dotted red histogram shows the data after subtraction of the background . ]      +",
    "the polarization was determined from elastic scattering events by the following equation : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 correspond to a given angular bin after correction for the acceptance , and p denotes the polarization .",
    "@xmath29 was calculated based on the results of the edda experiment  @xcite .",
    "the procedure is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the polarization determined from all experimental data is shown in fig .",

    "the upper panel shows the results for measurements with a polarized beam obtained for both studied beam momenta .",
    "the lower panel presents the polarization of the control sample , which has been measured with an unpolarized beam . in the case of the control sample ,",
    "the measured polarization is consistent with zero , within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "4 shows the results before and after the correction for shifts of the center the interaction region between the beam and the target  @xcite .",
    "the average polarization of all acquired data was calculated analyzing all events together .",
    "the results are shown in tab.[taballpol ] .",

    "the polarization of elastic scattering events in the reaction @xmath12 has been presented .",
    "the polarization differs between the spin modes .",
    "however , it is stable between runs for the whole period of data taking . additionally , the value of the polarization for an unpolarized beam has been measured to be consistent with zero , as expected .",
    "a high degree of polarization for both beam momenta gives a very good perspective for the determination of the analyzing power for the @xmath1 reaction .",
