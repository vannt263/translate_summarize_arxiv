    "in this paper we will describe what the mean - field picture and its central component , replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) , _ must _ mean for short - ranged spin glasses in all finite dimensions  and why it _ can not _ hold for these systems .    in a recent paper@xmath0 ( hereafter [ mprrz ] ) , marinari , parisi , ricci - tersenghi , ruiz - lorenzo , and zuliani have provided the most extensive description of the mean - field rsb picture offered to date . in response to earlier demonstrations@xmath1 ( hereafter [ ns96a ] , [ ns96b ] , [ ns97a ] , [ ns97b ] , and [ ns98 ] , respectively ) by the authors that the mean - field rsb picture can not describe the structure of thermodynamic , i.e. , infinite - volume , pure states at temperatures @xmath2 or ground states at @xmath3 of spin glasses in any finite dimension @xmath4 , [ mprrz ] proposed ( see also appendix 1 of the paper by marinari et  al .",
    "@xmath5 ) that rsb is not meant to provide such a description , but instead applies only to the structure of `` finite - volume pure states '' , which are the relevant physical objects . an unambiguous definition of finite - volume pure states was not provided , but it was emphasized that they were different from the `` pure states in an infinite system '' , i.e. , the usual thermodynamic pure states .",
    "however , in sec .",
    "[ sec : proof ] , we present a new proof ( whose applications go well beyond spin glasses alone ) , which , when applied in the current context , shows rigorously that the primary claims of [ mprrz]@xmath0 are _ incompatible _ with each other",

    "whether or not a new interpretation of the mean - field rsb theory in terms of `` finite - volume pure states '' can ever be precisely formulated , the more usual infinite - volume interpretations can not be avoided . but a mean - field structure for multiple _ thermodynamic _ states has been ruled out by the authors previous arguments@xmath1 .",
    "mean - field rsb theory therefore can not apply to realistic ( i.e. , finite - dimensional short - ranged ) spin glasses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : review ] we introduce many of the terms and concepts needed for later sections , and provide an abbreviated review of the issues concerning pure states within the framework of mean - field rsb theory .",

    "[ sec : proof ] we formally state our theorem that the mean - field rsb theory in fact _ must _ predict multiple thermodynamic pure state pairs with properties that have been previously ruled out ; and in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the implications of our theorem and present our conclusion .",
    "we also include two appendices .",
    "appendix  a is a brief summary of the definitions and properties of finite - volume gibbs states , infinite - volume gibbs states , and pure states .",
    "these play a major role in the text .",
    "appendix  b is a glossary providing brief definitions of other terms frequently used in the text ; some are in common usage in the literature , but most are less so .",
    "in this section we provide a review of the concepts and terms that will be used throughout , and provide an abbreviated overview of recent developments in the equilibrium theory of finite - dimensional spin glasses , as they pertain to the current discussion .",
    "detailed presentations can be found in the references cited .",
    "this section is included so that this paper is reasonably self - contained ; readers familiar with these topics may want to skip ahead to sec .  [",
    "sec : pinning ] .    for specificity ,",
    "we focus on the edwards - anderson@xmath10 ( ea ) ising spin glass , whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where the couplings @xmath12 are independently chosen from a gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance one , the sum is over only nearest neighbors on the @xmath4-dimensional cubic lattice @xmath13 , and the spins @xmath14 .",
    "we note for later , however , that our results apply to a wide range of models , including systems other than spin glasses .",
    "nontrivial replica symmetry breaking within the `` mean - field picture '' is associated with a number of remarkable properties , including the existence of many equilibrium states , non - self - averaging of overlap functions , ultrametricity of pure state overlaps , and several others less relevant to the current discussion .",
    "this picture is believed to describe the low - temperature phase of the infinite - ranged sherrington - kirkpatrick@xmath15 model , where the sum in the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) now runs over _ all _ pairs of spins , and the variance of the coupling distribution is rescaled to provide a sensible thermodynamic limit .",
    "we assume that the reader is largely familiar with this picture , and refer her / him to [ by]@xmath8 or [ mpv]@xmath9 for an extensive and detailed description . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to this picture and its variations as the mean - field picture , to adhere to common usage in the literature ; but it should be kept in mind that it is based on the parisi solution@xmath16 of the sherrington - kirkpatrick infinite - ranged model .",
    "numerous authors have asserted that mean - field - like rsb should describe the broken symmetry of the low - temperature phase of more realistic short - ranged , finite - dimensional spin glass models as well .",
    "its basic features , for a fixed @xmath17 , have been described in many places ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the existence of many equilibrium states not related by any simple symmetry transformation , and whose number grows without bound as system size @xmath18 ; ( 2 ) for fixed coupling realization @xmath19 , a nontrivial probability distribution @xmath20 , supported on countably many values @xmath21 , for the spin overlap between two different replicas ; ( 3 ) non - self - averaging , i.e. , @xmath19-dependence , of @xmath22 , so that averaging @xmath20 over all @xmath19 yields a @xmath23 supported on a continuum of values between @xmath24 , with nonzero weight at @xmath25 and @xmath26-function spikes at @xmath24 ; ( 4 ) ultrametricity of the spin overlaps @xmath21 among the equilibrium states ; ( 5 ) nontrivial edge overlap @xmath27 ; for example , if one chooses at fixed @xmath19 a ground state from a cube with periodic boundary conditions , and a second ground state from the same cube with antiperiodic boundary conditions , then there would be a nonvanishing density ( as @xmath18 ) of bonds satisfied in one but not the other ground state .",
    "to arrive at these features , the mean - field rsb picture postulates , as in [ mprrz]@xmath0 , that at fixed @xmath28 the finite - volume gibbs state @xmath29 in @xmath30 , the cube of side - length @xmath7 centered at the origin ( we henceforth assume periodic boundary conditions for specificity , but in fact our arguments will apply to any boundary conditions chosen independently of @xmath19 ) , is approximately a mixture of many pure states ( we defer until later the question of what this actually means ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the boltzmann weight in @xmath33 of pure state @xmath34 .",
    "the finite - volume overlap distribution @xmath35 is approximately the corresponding mixture of many @xmath26-functions : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the overlap between the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the number of sites in @xmath42 .",
    "an edge , or link , overlap distribution function can be similarly constructed@xmath43 . for simplicity , consider a ground state pair @xmath44 in @xmath30 with periodic boundary conditions , and a second ground state pair @xmath45 obtained in @xmath30 , e.g. , with antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "there will be a relative domain wall ( or walls ) between the pairs @xmath44 and @xmath45 , consisting of the set of bonds @xmath46 in the dual lattice satisfied in one and not the other ground state pair ; that is , they obey @xmath47 the link overlap between @xmath44 and @xmath45 is @xmath48 which is equal to one when @xmath49 and smaller than one otherwise . here",
    "@xmath50 is the edge set of , and @xmath51 is the number of edges in , @xmath30 .",
    "the edge overlap distribution function is then given by    @xmath52    while this interesting picture at first seems reasonably clear , on closer inspection there are numerous problems in interpretation when applied to realistic models .",
    "much of [ mprrz]@xmath0 is devoted to arriving at a definition of an `` equilibrium '' or `` pure '' state within the mean - field rsb picture ; but leaving that issue aside for now , there are numerous other questions that could affect interpretation of numerical measurements .",
    "for example , by what procedure are states , or replicas , chosen , and from what distribution ? in computing @xmath23 , what does one mean by the `` infinite - volume limit '' ? what is meant by non - self - averaging when its presence or absence may depend on the sequence of steps used to compute overlaps ?",
    "until these questions are clarified , we are forced to leave most of the above equations as approximate relations .    to illustrate , consider the situation at @xmath3 .",
    "for fixed @xmath19 and @xmath30 with periodic boundary conditions , there will be a single pair of ground states @xmath44 .",
    "the overlap function will therefore be a pair of @xmath26-functions at @xmath53 for all @xmath7 , and so the limiting @xmath23 is that same pair of @xmath26-functions , independently of @xmath54 . does this imply a single pair of ground states , as predicted by the droplet / scaling picture of macmillan@xmath55 , bray and moore@xmath56 , fisher and huse@xmath57 , and others ? not necessarily , because if there were many ground state pairs then @xmath44 would change chaotically with @xmath7 , though for any single @xmath7 one would see only a single pair . the presence or absence of this _",
    "chaotic size dependence@xmath58 _ ( hereafter [ ns92 ] ) is a reliable test@xmath59 of whether there are , respectively , many ground state pairs or only a single pair .",
    "but if there are many ground state pairs , can one construct @xmath23 in order to see them ?",
    "the most straightforward , and natural , interpretation of the features of the rsb mean - field picture described above is that the `` pure '' states in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) are the usual thermodynamic pure states , which are easily and unambiguously defined for the ea model ( see , e.g. , appendix  a of this paper and [ ns97a , ns97b , ns98]@xmath60 ) . in this interpretation , for almost every fixed @xmath19 there would be an infinite number of these states",
    ". the spin overlap distribution function would be nontrivial in the sense described in the preceding section , and would satisfy the properties of non - self - averaging and ultrametricity ( including at @xmath3 )",
    ". the edge overlap distribution function would similarly be nontrivial and non - self - averaging .",
    "procedures for constructing overlap distributions are provided in [ ns96a]@xmath61 .",
    "this interpretation has generally been the standard view ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and is one way to answer the questions posed in the previous section . it allows us to replace the approximate relation eq .",
    "( [ eq : sum ] ) with an equality @xmath62 where @xmath63 is an infinite volume mixed gibbs state for a particular coupling realization @xmath19 , the @xmath34 are infinite - volume pure states for that @xmath19 , and the @xmath64 their corresponding weights in @xmath65 .",
    "the other equations in section  [ subsec : rsb ] are similarly replaced with exact relations .",
    "the overlap random variable becomes @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are chosen from the product distribution @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath67 is drawn from @xmath34 and @xmath68 from @xmath70 , then it follows that the overlap is the constant @xmath71 the probability distribution @xmath22 of @xmath72 is therefore given by @xmath73 edge overlap distribution functions are similarly defined .",
    "however , it was rigorously shown in [ ns96a]@xmath61 that _ this standard interpretation of the mean - field picture can not hold at any temperature in any finite dimension _ , because the @xmath20 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pj(q)ea ] ) must be self - averaging , i.e. , the same for almost every @xmath19 .",
    "this also rules out the possibility of nontrivial ultrametricity among the thermodynamic pure states .",
    "we note that the ( nonrigorous ) arguments of parisi and ricci - tersenghi@xmath74 , claiming to support ultrametricity among _ all _ the equilibrium states of finite - dimensional spin glasses , are in fact also consistent with _ trivial _",
    "ultrametricity , such as that displayed in the droplet / scaling two - state picture or the many - state chaotic pairs picture ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ subsec : metastates ] below ) .",
    "one must therefore adopt an unconventional interpretation of the mean - field rsb picture if there is to be any hope of its application to realistic spin glasses .",
    "the standard interpretation just described is a natural extrapolation to large lengthscales of numerical simulations necessarily done on cubes @xmath30 with relatively small @xmath7 .",
    "what is typically done numerically , of course , is to generate ( usually with periodic boundary conditions , assumed here for specificity ) finite - volume equilibrium gibbs states ( see appendix a ) in @xmath30 and then to measure the overlap distribution for fixed @xmath19 ; then repeat the procedure for different @xmath19 s and compute the disorder - averaged @xmath75 . doing this for several different @xmath7 s allows one to examine finite - size scaling and other properties of overlap functions .",
    "numerically , one has no choice but to follow this or some similar procedure ; but in [ ns96b]@xmath76 it was shown that evidence for rsb arising from this approach can correspond to more than one thermodynamic picture . the above procedure , if extrapolated to arbitrarily large @xmath7 , gives rise to a @xmath77 without any explicit or prior construction of thermodynamic states . ( another procedure that _ does _ first construct states and then computes overlaps is given in [ ns96a]@xmath61 ) .    in these numerical computations ,",
    "replica symmetry is of necessity broken _ before _ the @xmath18 limit is taken .",
    "guerra@xmath78 has pointed out that changing the order of these limits can be quite significant . that this interchange of limits@xmath76 can lead to a new thermodynamic picture of the spin glass phase",
    "does not seem to have been appreciated prior to [ ns96a , ns96b ] .    based on these considerations , a new , nonstandard interpretation of the mean - field rsb picture",
    "was described in detail in sec .",
    "vii of [ ns97b]@xmath79 ; we provide only a brief summary here .",
    "it is a maximal mean - field picture , preserving mean - field theory s main features , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : rsb ] , although in an unusual way .",
    "the most natural description of this nonstandard interpretation is in terms of the _ metastate _ , described in the next section , but in order to simplify the discussion we forego use of the metastate here .    as a starting point , then , this interpretation would mean that in any large @xmath30 , the gibbs state is an approximate decomposition over many _",
    "thermodynamic _ pure states : @xmath80 where a few states dominate the sum in any fixed @xmath7 .",
    "the overlap distribution in @xmath30 for fixed @xmath19 , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pl ] ) , is nontrivial : for any fixed , large @xmath7 it would be a sum of several @xmath26-functions , and the locations of these @xmath26-functions would satisfy ultrametricity increasingly accurately as @xmath18 . when averaged over @xmath19 at fixed @xmath7 , this distribution would broaden into a continuum between two @xmath26-functions at @xmath24 .",
    "( [ eq : sumfinite ] ) and the properties listed after it all hold equally well for the standard interpretation of mean - field rsb described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : standard ] .",
    "the difference between the standard and nonstandard interpretations arises from their thermodynamics ; the straightforward extrapolation to infinite volumes characteristic of the standard interpretation is absent in the nonstandard picture . in the latter case , the",
    "infinitely many thermodynamic pure states are grouped into `` families '' of mixed states ( the @xmath81 s of sec .",
    "[ subsec : metastates ] ) , each of which _ individually _ has the properties listed in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the union of all of these families , which loses these properties , comprises the thermodynamic structure of the nonstandard interpretation .",
    "the crucial conceptual point is that the resulting _ ensemble _ of overlap distributions remains independent of @xmath19 .",
    "so while overlap distributions still do _ not _ depend on @xmath19 , one now replaces the usual notion of non - self - averaging over @xmath19 s with a nonstandard one : that is , averaging over @xmath7 s for fixed @xmath19 .",
    "it can be shown that this picture must have uncountably many pure states and overlaps , so that _ ultrametricity would not hold in general_@xmath61 _ among any three pure states chosen at fixed _",
    "@xmath19 , unlike in the standard interpretation ( see , for example , the papers of vincent et al.@xmath82 and of badoni et al.@xmath83 ) . instead",
    ", each large @xmath30 would pick out a subset of these ( one of the families discussed above ) that _ do _ satisfy ultrametricity .",
    "unfortunately for the mean - field approach , it can also be shown that this picture can not hold at any temperature in any dimension , as discussed in the next section .      to explain why even the nonstandard interpretation can not be valid",
    ", we need to introduce the concept of _ metastate _ , discussed in detail in [ ns96b , ns97a , ns97b , ns98]@xmath84 .",
    "( for some uses of this concept in mean field models , see the papers of klske@xmath85 , bovier and gayrard@xmath86 , and bovier et al.@xmath87 . )",
    "metastates enable us to relate the observed behavior of a system in large but finite volumes with its thermodynamic properties .",
    "this relation is relatively straightforward for systems with few pure states or for those whose states are related by well - understood symmetry transformations , as typically occurs in homogeneous systems .",
    "experience with these has mostly guided intuition in the case of disordered systems .",
    "however , one of our early results is that , in the presence of many pure states not related by any clear - cut symmetry transformations , the relation between the system s thermodynamic properties and its behavior in large but finite volumes may be non - obvious .",
    "this is primarily due to the following result of [ ns92]@xmath58 : if a system has many , non - symmetry - related , pure states , the sequence of finite - volume gibbs measures generated using coupling - independent boundary conditions will generally _ not _ converge to a single limiting thermodynamic state as @xmath18 .",
    "this is the phenomenon of _ chaotic size dependence _ , mentioned in sec .",
    "[ subsec : rsb ] . in the metastate approach , rather than avoid this problem , we exploit it by focusing on an _ ensemble _ of ( pure or mixed ) thermodynamic states .",
    "this approach , based on an analogy to chaotic dynamical systems , allows the construction of a limiting measure . hence the term _ metastate _  while a thermodynamic state is a probability measure on infinite - volume spin configurations ( see appendix a ) , this new limiting measure is one _ on the thermodynamic states themselves_.    this infinite - volume measure has a particular usefulness in the context of finite volumes because it tells us the likelihood of appearance of any specified _ thermodynamic _ state , pure or mixed , in a typical large volume .",
    "more precisely , it provides a probability measure for all possible @xmath88-point correlation functions contained in a box ( or `` window '' ) , centered at the origin , whose sides are sufficiently far from any of the boundaries so that finite size or boundary effects do not appreciably affect the result .",
    "( we discuss this in more detail in sec .",
    "[ subsec : windows ] . )",
    "there are several ways of constructing metastates . in [ ns96b ,",
    "ns97a , ns97b]@xmath89 we introduced the empirical distribution approach .",
    "this considers , at fixed @xmath19 , a sequence of volumes with coupling - independent boundary conditions .",
    "each finite - volume gibbs state @xmath90 in the sequence is given weight @xmath91 .",
    "this allows us to construct a histogram of finite - volume gibbs states ; it was shown in [ ns96b , ns97a ] that this histogram converges to a probability measure @xmath92 on the thermodynamic states as @xmath93 . a finite - volume gibbs state in a particular ( large ) volume",
    "approximates ( deep in its interior  cf .  the remarks in the preceding paragraph ) some infinite - volume thermodynamic state @xmath81 restricted to that volume .",
    "the resulting metastate @xmath92 therefore specifies the fraction of cube sizes that the system spends in each different thermodynamic state @xmath81 .",
    "an individual @xmath81 may be either pure or mixed , depending on the system and the boundary conditions used .",
    "the empirical distribution approach presented above was shown in [ ns96b , ns97a]@xmath94 to be equivalent to an earlier construction of aizenman and wehr@xmath95 . in this alternative approach",
    ", the randomness of the couplings is used directly to generate an ensemble of states .",
    "it can be proved that the two approaches are basically equivalent , in that there exists at least a @xmath19-independent subsequence of volumes along which both methods yield the _ same _ limiting metastate@xmath96 .    the metastate approach is specifically designed to consider both finite and infinite volumes together and to unify the two cases .",
    "in essence , the metastate provides the probability , for a randomly chosen large @xmath7 , of various thermodynamic pure ( or ground , at @xmath3 ) states appearing inside any fixed @xmath97 .",
    "we return now to the nonviability of the nonstandard interpretation of the mean - field rsb theory in realistic spin glass models .",
    "our claim is based on a simple theorem , presented in [ ns98]@xmath98 , with a powerful implication  that ( at fixed @xmath4 and @xmath28 ) the metastate @xmath92 is _ invariant _ with respect to flip - related boundary conditions , chosen independently of the couplings .",
    "that is , the metastate constructed using periodic boundary conditions on the @xmath30 s is the same as that constructed using antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "even if one were to choose two _ arbitrary _ sequences of periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions , the metastates would _",
    "still _ be identical .",
    "the metastate , and its corresponding overlap distributions , is therefore highly insensitive to boundary conditions .",
    "this metastate invariance has profound consequences .",
    "it means that the frequency of appearance of various thermodynamic states in finite volumes is _ independent _ of the choice of periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , this same invariance property holds among any two sequences of _ fixed _ boundary conditions ; the fixed boundary condition may even be allowed to vary arbitrarily along any single sequence of volumes !",
    "it follows that , with respect to changes of boundary conditions , the metastate is highly robust .",
    "if there were only a single thermodynamic state , such as paramagnetic , or a single pair of states as in droplet / scaling , this would be expected .",
    "but can this result can be reconciled with the presence of _ many _ thermodynamic states ?",
    "the answer is yes , but it puts severe constraints on the form of the metastate and overlap distribution functions . in light of this strong invariance property ,",
    "any metastate constructed via coupling - independent boundary conditions should be able to support only a very simple structure , effectively ruling out the nonstandard interpretation of the mean - field rsb picture .",
    "how can this invariance property be reconciled with the presence of many non - symmetry - related pure or ground states ?",
    "the only plausible possibility is that in any metastate constructed from coupling - independent boundary conditions ( periodic , antiperiodic , free , fixed , etc . ) , all pure thermodynamic states are equally likely .",
    "that is , each of these metastates should be supported _ uniformly _ in some appropriate sense ( which can be made precise only with detailed knowledge about the pure states  see , e.g. , the discussion in sec .",
    "iv of [ ns98]@xmath98 ) on the pure state pairs in that metastate .",
    "this is the only plausible way in which all sorts of different boundary conditions could give rise to the same pure state distribution .",
    "such a uniform distribution , though , is inconsistent with the features of the nonstandard mean - field picture .",
    "that picture requires a _",
    "non_uniform distribution over the pure states ( for further discussion , see [ ns98]@xmath98 ) , as does _ any _ picture in which a nonzero fraction of @xmath81 s consists of a nontrivial mixture of pure state pairs .",
    "there is only one many - state picture of which we are aware that is consistent with this theorem .",
    "this is the _",
    "chaotic pairs _ picture , introduced in [ ns92]@xmath58 and [ ns96b]@xmath76 and further developed in [ ns97a , ns97b , ns98]@xmath60 .",
    "the chaotic pairs picture resembles the scaling / droplet picture in finite volumes , but has a very different thermodynamic structure .",
    "it has _ infinitely _ many thermodynamic pure states , but , unlike any mean - field picture , in each large volume with periodic boundary conditions one `` sees '' only one pair of pure states at a time .",
    "that is , for large @xmath7 , one finds that @xmath99 where @xmath100 refers to the global spin - flip of pure state @xmath38 .",
    "so each @xmath7 picks out a single pure state pair from the infinitely many present .",
    "if all @xmath30 have periodic boundary conditions , then the chaotic pairs picture would exhibit chaotic size dependence , unlike the droplet / scaling picture .",
    "in other words , in the scaling / droplet picture , the low - temperature , periodic boundary condition metastate is supported on one thermodynamic mixed state @xmath81 consisting of a single pure state pair , and this @xmath81 is seen in a fraction one of the @xmath30 s . in chaotic pairs ,",
    "the metastate is dispersed over infinitely many @xmath81 s , of the form @xmath101 ; here , two different @xmath30 s will typically see _ different but single _ pure state pairs .",
    "the overlap distribution for each @xmath81 , hence each @xmath30 ( for @xmath7 large ) is the same : @xmath102 so the disorder - averaged spin overlap function @xmath23 _ and _ link overlap function @xmath27 , when constructed by breaking the replica symmetry _ before _ taking the thermodynamic limit , as in sec .",

    "in chaotic pairs , @xmath22 would now most likely equal @xmath107 : it was proven by the authors@xmath108 that @xmath109 for the spin overlaps of @xmath110-spin - flip - stable metastable states for any finite @xmath110 , and , if there are infinitely many ground state pairs , we expect the same to be true for ground states , i.e. , for @xmath111 .",
    "the form of the edge overlap function in the chaotic pairs picture , when replica symmetry breaking occurs after taking @xmath18 , is less clear ; the contribution coming from relative interfaces between the many pairs of pure states may well be a @xmath26-function , but unlike any two - state picture , would be supported on a link overlap @xmath112 even at @xmath3 .",
    "( a lengthier discussion of link overlap functions in given in sec .",
    "[ sec : links ] . )",
    "our conclusions are therefore that _ the thermodynamic overlap structure in spin glasses must be simple _ , regardless of whether there are infinitely many pure states or only a single pair .",

    "this follows because the corresponding spin configurations are limits of finite - volume ground state pairs ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "however , another method of constructing interfaces uses a single boundary condition ( typically periodic ) and adds a perturbation , either by forcing a pair of spins to take an opposite relative orientation from that in the ground state , as in [ km]@xmath127 , or by adding a bulk perturbation to the hamiltonian , as in [ py]@xmath128 ; the two methods are believed to give equivalent results .",

    "if the interface is _ pinned _ , then one can prove again that it separates true thermodynamic ground state pairs , as follows .",
    "as in [ ns01]@xmath129 , let the two spins be chosen randomly for each @xmath30 from the uniform distribution on its sites . because in the @xmath18 limit the two sites will , with probability one , be outside any fixed window , the spin configuration inside the window will have minimum energy ( given its configuration on the boundary of the window ) .",

    "we turn now to the central argument of our paper .",
    "an unambiguous prediction of the mean - field rsb approach , applied to finite - dimensional spin glasses , is that the edge overlap distribution function @xmath27 ( eq .  ( [ eq : qeab ] ) ) is nontrivial on all length scales .",

    "it was noted in [ mp00a , mp00b ] that nontriviality in @xmath27 at @xmath3 can be ascribed to the presence of space - filling domain walls between ground states generated from different boundary conditions , or between ground and excited states with the latter generated through a perturbation ( cf .",
    "[ sec : pinning ] ) .",
    "this important feature of rsb theory can be described in the following way .",

    "consider as before the spin configuration generated by forcing a random pair of spins to take on an opposite orientation from that in @xmath44 , and then letting the resulting configuration relax to a new state @xmath154 with minimum energy subject to this constraint ( alternatively , one could add a bulk perturbation as in [ py , mp00b ] .",
    "then a central _ physical _ feature of the mean - field rsb picture ( [ mprrz , mp00a , mp00b ] ) is that @xmath44 and @xmath155 differ in the following ways : 1 ) their difference is global , i.e. , there are @xmath156 spins flipped in going from @xmath44 to @xmath155 ; 2 ) the lengthscale @xmath157 of their relative interface is @xmath158 , and the number of bonds in the interface scales as @xmath159 with @xmath160 , i.e. , the interface is space - filling ; and 3 ) the energy of the relative interface remains of order one independently of @xmath161 so that the domain wall energy scales as @xmath162 with @xmath163 .",
    "domain walls with these properties will henceforth be called _",
    "rsb interfaces_. it is easy to see that , at @xmath3 , properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) already give rise to nontrivial @xmath27 ( and conversely that nontrivial @xmath27 implies the existence of interfaces with those properties ) .",
    "what about @xmath2 ?",
    "now , because rsb asserts that each individual low - temperature gibbs state is a mixture of several states , it predicts that even without any perturbations , there will be nontrivial @xmath23 and @xmath27 inside @xmath30 as described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : rsb ] .",
    "this prediction relies heavily on property ( 3 ) of the rsb interfaces , namely that their energies are @xmath164 ; if properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) were valid , but not ( 3 ) , this would lead to the chaotic pairs picture ( cf .",

    ". here an overbar represents an average over coupling realizations .",
    "this bound is rigorously obeyed by a gibbs state generated from a _ single _ boundary condition , regardless of how many pure states it contains .    but now suppose that one generates _ two _ gibbs states at @xmath2 in @xmath30 , e.g. , one with and one without a palassini - young bulk perturbation ( [ py ] ) , as in [ mp00b ]",
    ". then it should still be true that the contribution to @xmath27 from trivial thermal excitations would remain bounded by @xmath167 , but the contribution from multiple rsb - like states , if present , would not obey any such bound .",

    "we now address the central question of this paper : are rsb interfaces , which comprise a central feature of mean - field rsb theory , compatible with the claims of [ mprrz ] that a thermodynamic interpretation of rsb pure states can be avoided ? in other words , can rsb domain walls _ avoid _ giving rise to many traditional thermodynamic pure states ?    we will provide a proof in the next section that the answer is _ no _ ; these central predictions of mean - field rsb theory are _ rigorously incompatible _ with each other .",
