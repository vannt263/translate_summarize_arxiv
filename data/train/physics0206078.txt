    "fusion plasmas , and possibly other quasi two - dimensional fluid systems , may undergo a more - or - less dramatic transition from a low to a high confinement state ( the l ",
    "h transition ) as the power input is increased , with the desirable outcome that particle and energy confinement is greatly improved due to localized transport reduction @xcite . in this work",
    "we report on a bifurcation and stability probe of an economical model for l  h transition dynamics that uncovers a mechanism by which a radical change , or metamorphosis , may occur in the qualitative nature of the dynamics .",
    "we apply the results of this analysis to clarify the relationship between the structure of the model and the physics of the process that it describes , and draw comparisons with characteristics of l  h transitions observed in various experiments .",
    "since 1988 there has been much progress in developing low - dimensional ( low - order or reduced ) descriptions of l  h transition dynamics and associated oscillatory phenomena ( see , for example , refs ) , the driving force being the potential power of a unified , low - dimensional model as a predictive tool for the design and control of confinement states .",
    "for example , a model that speaks of the shape and extent of hysteresis in the l  h transition would help engineers who are interested in controlling access to h - mode .",
    "given the many variables and parameters that _ could _ be varied around a hysteretic rgime , it would be cheaper ",
    "i.e . , save hundreds of cpu hours and/ or many expensive diagnostics  to know in advance which ones actually _ do _ affect the hysteresis , and which do not .    to help construe the context in which low - dimensional descriptions of plasma dynamics are sought ,",
    "it is appropriate at this stage to make some general remarks .",
    "it makes sense to try to find the simplest description of an evolving system that is consistent with the time and space scales on which one is interested in making experimental observations of that system .",
    "one would like the description to incorporate the qualitative nature of the system structure and dynamics , so that it can be used for design and control purposes and make useful predictions .",
    "a truly useful description usually turns out to be a low - dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "such descriptions are powerful because they are supported by well - developed theories that give qualitative and global insight , such as bifurcation , stability , and symmetry theory @xcite . in principle",
    "we can map analytically the bifurcation structure of the entire state and parameter space of a low - dimensional dynamical system , but this is not yet possible for an infinite - dimensional system .",
    "however , the quest for a low - dimensional state space that captures the qualitative dynamics of l  h transitions has been problematic .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that some of the models cited above do not reflect salient features of l  h transitions such as shear flow suppression of turbulence , or are incomplete , or show profound structural discrepancies , although it is intuitively reasonable to expect that manifestly different models should be equivalent at some deeper level if they describe the same phenomena .    by economical , or minimal , model we mean the smallest , functionally simplest , and mathematically consistent model that captures qualitatively the dynamical traits that are typically observed over many experiments in different machines .",
    "the strength and potency of a minimal model is just this universality ; its apparent disregard for details , numbers and unit dimensions is sometimes perceived ",
    "wrongly  as a weakness . in keeping with this ideology",
    "we introduce here a consensus dynamical model that is economical in terms of variables and parameters , and incorporates the smallest number of rate processes of simplest functional form needed to reflect the universally observed dynamics . if the model is successful we expect additional terms to have only quantitative , not qualitative or structural , effects .",
    "we should also be able to identify easily its limits of validity , or where it breaks down and why .    in section [ two ]",
    "we introduce the plasma turbulence governor as a useful schema to conceptualize and represent the major contributing rate and feedback processes , relating these to the corresponding dynamical system .",
    "bifurcation and stability analyses and interpretive discussions , with reference to reported experiments , are given in the remaining sections . in section",
    "[ three ] we begin by determining the two highest order ( most degenerate ) singularities in the system , or _ organizing centers_. section [ four ] describes the generic bifurcation diagram and discusses the hysteresis and limit cycles in the system . in section [ five ] we illustrate and discuss the useful properties of the two - parameter bifurcation diagram .",
    "this discussion leads in to section [ six ] , in which we determine explicitly the transcritical metamorphosis to an oscillatory , non - hysteretic rgime .",

    "the original sugama - horton model was found to exhibit a chaotic time series for a particular set of parameter values in this rgime @xcite . in our model",
    "we have found that this branch of limit cycles can undergo several successive period doublings followed by period halvings back to a period - one limit cycle .",
    "the limit cycles are also _ extinguished _ at hopf bifurcations . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that oscillatory behaviour is regulated by the contribution of the pressure gradient evolution . at moderately high power input",

    "@xcite : `` the key factors in creating the quiescent h - mode operation are neutral beam injection in the direction opposite to the plasma current ( counterinjection ) plus cryopumping to reduce the density . ''",
    "reports of reversals in the direction of main or impurity ion poloidal shear flow @xcite can also be rationalized on the basis of fig .",

    "the poloidal shear flow _ must _ reverse if a perturbation decreases the power input slightly below that at the lower limit point .",

    "note that in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] the shear flow @xmath4 reaches a broad maximum with increasing power input , then decreases to the the pre - transition level given by the shear flow source",
    ". this would be reasonable behaviour on physical grounds  one would not expect the shear flow to increase indefinitely with power input , because the turbulent viscosity damping ( the second term in eq .",

    "clearly there is scope for tuning other parameters in the model so as to obtain a complete picture of the steady states and limit cycles over parameter space , and more quantitative agreements with experiments .",

    "transitions with hysteresis have been observed in several machines : diii - d @xcite , asdex upgrade @xcite , jet , and in simulations of iter @xcite , and alcator c - mod @xcite .",
    "hysteresis is typically modified by dissipation , characterised in this model by the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "however , hysteresis does not seem to be a necessary or universal feature of discontinuous transitions .",
    "one of the typical features of l  h transitions that a minimal model should reflect is suppression of the turbulence by the shear flow .",
    "figure [ figure5 ] shows the bifurcation diagram with the mean square turbulence level @xmath2 as the state variable , where for clarity only the curve that matches the positive @xmath4 branch is given .",
    "the turbulence is clearly suppressed over the hysteretic region , then begins to grow again as the higher pressure gradient from higher power input creates more turbulence .     as chosen state variable , showing the curve that corresponds to the positive @xmath4 branch in fig .",

    "a rgime in which density fluctuation amplitudes are reduced continuously was also observed in @xcite . in @xcite a discontinuous bifurcation of the electric field in a stellarator",
    "was reported for conditions of low neutral density , where the charge - exchange damping rate is low .",
    "the change in the electric field became gradual for conditions of high neutral density , because the charge - exchange damping rate increases .",

    "this transition is _ very _ different from the intrinsically hysteretic transition depicted in fig [ figure3 ] . here",
    "the stable attractor on the upper branch is a limit cycle rather than a fixed point .",
    "furthermore , this transition is _ not _ hysteretic .",
    "in fact , hysteresis is ( locally ) forbidden by the condition @xmath72 of eq .",
    "therefore it is not modulated by dissipation in the same way as the transition in fig.[figure3 ] , although the feedback itself is still due to nonlinear dissipation rates .    as the value of @xmath6",
