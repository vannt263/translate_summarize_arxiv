    "it is well known , [ [ skorokhod ] ] , that that there is another sequence , @xmath31 , defined on @xmath10 ( equipped with lebesgue measure ) , with each @xmath11 equivalent in distribution to @xmath12 , such that @xmath32 converges almost surely to @xmath33 , the standard normal . however , is there a general method for obtaining , for each @xmath18 , an i.i.d .",

    "this is the natural counterpart , for almost sure convergence , of the standard notion of triangular array representation .    at this level of generality",
    ", the problem appears to be quite difficult .",
    "this paper begins the investigation of the problem in the simple but important setting where the sequence @xmath36 is the ( equiprobable ) random walk on @xmath7 with domain @xmath10 . for @xmath37 , write @xmath1 , with each @xmath2 and @xmath3 for infinitely many @xmath4 . for @xmath38 and @xmath37 , we take @xmath39 ; this gives the simplest expression for the @xmath12 . even in this simple setting , the behavior of the @xmath40 is extremely chaotic and the disorder increases with @xmath18 .",
    "one manifestion of this chaos is an easy consequence of the lil , [ [ khintchine ] ] , [ [ kolmogoroff ] ] for example : for almost all @xmath41 and @xmath42 . on the other hand ,",
    "each @xmath11 is a non - decreasing step function , mirroring the almost sure convergence of the sequence of normalizations .",
    "the graphs of @xmath12 and @xmath11 for @xmath43 are included below .",
    "@xmath12 is shown in magenta , while @xmath11 is shown in green .    ]    ]    since @xmath11 is equal in distribution to @xmath12 , it follows that @xmath11 does have triangular array representations .",
    "but what about _ strong _ ones , in the sense of the first paragraph ? specializing to this setting ,",
    "the problem laid out in that paragraph can be restated as follows .",
    "how do we obtain _ strong _ triangular array representations , @xmath44 , of @xmath35 ?",
    "what do the @xmath17 look like , as functions of @xmath45 ?    the lil has implications , here , as well .",
    "for example , for each @xmath18 , at least one of the @xmath17 must depend on more than one bit .",
    "also , the @xmath17 must depend on @xmath18 , not just on @xmath4 .",
    "we will give an explicit procedure for obtaining the sought - after @xmath17 , and they will have an additional property ; they are _ trim _ in that , for fixed @xmath18 , each @xmath46 will depend only on @xmath47 .",
    "this leads naturally to the next question .",
    "what are the _ trim , strong _ triangular array representations of @xmath48 ?",
    "our procedure starts from any sequence @xmath21 , where each @xmath22 is a permutation of @xmath49 with the additional property of being _",
    "any permutation , @xmath50 , of @xmath49 , can be viewed as permuting the level @xmath18 dyadic intervals ( by permuting their indices ) .",
    "this provides a rearrangement of @xmath10 .",
    "such a permutation is _ admissible _ iff @xmath11 results when the corresponding rearrangement is followed by applying @xmath12 ( as a function ) .",
    "this is made precise in equation ( 1 ) of subsection ( 1.2 ) .    for each @xmath18 ,",
    "the passage from @xmath22 to @xmath51 is explicit , canonical and one - to - one and is given by equation ( 2 ) of the proof of theorem 1 in ( 2.2 ) .",
    "further , as @xmath22 varies over admissible permutations , our procedure generates _ all _ possible suitable families @xmath52 , where each @xmath17 is trim .",
    "the passage from @xmath51 to @xmath22 is given by equation ( 3 ) , also in ( 2.2 ) .",
    "the obvious extension to a canonical bjection between sequences of admissible permutations and trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath35 is given by corollary 1 .",
    "thus theorem 1 and corollary 1 answer questions 1 and 2 .",
    "since almost sure convergence is such a restrictive condition , it is natural to ask how hard it is to produce the trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath35 and what additional special properties they must have . as with the existence of",
    "trim strong triangular array representations , prior to this paper , very little was known ; to our knowledge , the questions in the previous sentence have not been considered until now .",
    "once we know how to associate sequences of admissible permutations to trim strong triangular array representations , it becomes natural to pursue these questions in terms of the complexity of the associated sequences . the second half of the paper carries out such a complexity analysis , motivated by the following questions .",
    "are there trim , strong triangular representations of @xmath48 of low complexity ?",
    "are there trim , strong triangular array representations of @xmath48 which differ as little as possible from the above representation of @xmath53 and which are also of low complexity ?",
    "we explicitly construct three trim , strong triangular array representations of quite low complexity , as measured by the complexity of their classifying sequences of admissible permutations , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "our basic complexity estimate is that they are all polynomial time computable ( we make this precise in subsection ( 1.2 ) ) .",
    "this is the content of theorem 2 , in subsection ( 3.4 ) , for @xmath56 and of theorem 3 , in subsection ( 4.2 ) , for @xmath57 and @xmath55 .",
    "these results therefore answer question 3 affirmatively .",
    "since @xmath57 and @xmath55 are constructed so as to differ as little as possible from the representation of @xmath36 by @xmath14 , theorem 3 answers question 4 affirmatively .",
    "the proofs of theorems 2 and 3 yield the somewhat sharper result that each of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is very simply computed in terms of the function we denote by sbc ( for sum of binomial coefficients ) introduced in definition 1 in subsection ( 3.1 ) .",
    "this function is very naturally associated with the binomial distributions with parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the computation of each of the three sequences in terms of sbc is a counterpart to the result that @xmath24 has a very simple expression in terms of _ any _ sequence , @xmath58 , of admissible permutations .",
    "thus , the complexity of each of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is bracketed in the fairly narrow range between that of @xmath24 and that of sbc .",
    "we shed further light on the relationship between sbc and @xmath56 in corollary 4 of subsection ( 3.5 ) ; discussion is deferred until ( 1.3.5 ) and section 3 .    while their properties are indeed rather special , the trim strong triangular array representations corresponding to @xmath54 and @xmath55 are , perhaps surprisingly , not so diffiicult to produce , since they are of low complexity . at least in this context , the `` cost '' of the passage from @xmath59 and the weakly covergent @xmath30 to the ( trim ) strong triangular array representations of the almost surely convergent @xmath13 turns out to be surprisingly modest .",
    "progress has been made in the direction of extending our methods to a more general setting .",
    "this will be the subject of a planned sequel to this paper .",
    "this paper grows out of chapters 3 and 4 of skyers dissertation , [ [ skyers ] ] , written with stanley as advisor .",
    ", served as a `` co - advisor '' , and provided the inspiration and impetus for the entire project . for recent work related to skorokhod s work , in a rather different vein than this paper , see [ [ berti1 ] ] , [ [ berti2 ] ] .",
    "let @xmath60 be a random variable ( on _ any _ probability space ) .",
    "let @xmath61 be the cumulative distribution of @xmath60 .",
    "by the _ quantile of _ @xmath60 ( denoted by @xmath62 ) , we mean the random variable on @xmath10 ( equipped with lebesgue measure , @xmath63 , on borel sets , @xmath64 ) defined by : @xmath65 it is well - known that @xmath60 and @xmath62 are equal in distribution .",
    "skorokhod , [ [ skorokhod ] ] , showed that if @xmath66 is a sequence of random variables ( on _ any _ probability space ) converging weakly to @xmath60 , then the sequence of quantiles , @xmath67 , converges almost surely to @xmath62 .    in order to compare the structure of the initial sequence to that of the sequence of quantiles , the probability space of the @xmath68",
    "should be @xmath69 , as above . in what follows",
    ", we work exclusively in this probability space .    in this paper , @xmath70 will _ always _ denote non - negative integers ( elements of @xmath71 ) . most often",
    ", we will have @xmath27 .",
    "we use @xmath72 for the cardinality of a set , @xmath60 . to emphasize that a union is a _ disjoint union _ we use @xmath73 or @xmath74 rather than the usual @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "when the nature of the index set is clear or has been established , we use @xmath77 to denote the sequence ( possibly finite , possibly multi - indexed ) whose term , for index @xmath4 , is @xmath78 .",
    "we use @xmath79 to denote the characteristic ( or indicator ) function of a set @xmath80 , viewed as a subset of an ambient set @xmath81 , the domain of the characteristic function .",
    "when @xmath81 is clear from context , we will omit it in the subscript .",
    "this notation is intended to cover the situation where @xmath80 is a relation , i.e. where @xmath81 is a set of @xmath82 for some fixed @xmath83 .    for integers ,",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath84 denotes the @xmath85 level @xmath18 dyadic interval : @xmath86 note that both @xmath12 and @xmath11 are constant on each level @xmath18 dyadic interval .",
    "a permutation , @xmath50 , of @xmath87 is _ admissible _ if @xmath88    in several places , we will have a function , @xmath89 , with domain @xmath10 , which , for some @xmath18 , is constant on each of the @xmath90 .",
    "we then use @xmath91 ( `` @xmath91 '' for the integer version of @xmath89 ) to denote the function with domain @xmath92 , whose value at @xmath93 is the constant value of @xmath89 on @xmath90 . thus , for example , @xmath94 and @xmath95 will denote the integer versions of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we adopt a similar convention for subsets , @xmath96 , such that @xmath60 is a union of level @xmath18 dyadic intervals .",
    "we will then use @xmath97 to denote the set of @xmath93 such that @xmath98 . strictly speaking , in both cases ( function or subset )",
    "the dependence on the specific @xmath18 involved should be part of the notation , but , in all instances , this will already be incorporated into the notation used for the specific @xmath89 or @xmath60 involved .",
    "our basic complexity estimate is in terms of polynomial time computability .",
    "this notion is robust across different detailed models of computations , each of which has its own sensible notion of `` elementary operation '' .",
    "accordingly , as is customary , we omit a detailed development of what is involved in this notion .",
    "if @xmath99 is a function of @xmath100 natural number arguments , @xmath99 is polynomial time computable ( p - time ) iff for some polynomial , @xmath101 , the value of @xmath99 can be computed in at most @xmath101 elementary operations whenever all arguments are smaller than @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with the usual treatments ( e.g. [ [ clote ] ] or [ [ papa ] ] ) , which , for the most part , treat arguments and values as bitstrings or vectors of bitstrings , rather than in terms of the encoded natural numbers . in some important instances , @xmath99 will have @xmath102 arguments , the first of which is viewed as being @xmath18 itself ( the argument of @xmath103 . ) in this context , the requirement is that at most @xmath101 elementary operations are required to compute @xmath104 whenever each @xmath105 .",
    "polynomial - time decidable ( p - time decidable ) relations are ones whose characteristic functions are p - time .      by corollary 1 ,",
    "the existence of trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath35 reduces to the existence of sequences of admissible permutations , which further reduces to the existence of admissible permutations of @xmath49 , for each @xmath18 .",
    "this is established in part 2 of lemma 1 of ( 3.1 ) ; the precise statement is that there are @xmath106 of them .",
    "this count builds on a more concrete characterization of admissibility developed , among other things , in ( 3.1 ) .    in ( 3.2 ) , corollary 2 pulls together the statements of theorem 1 , corollary 1 and part 2 of lemma 1 to give the existence proof for trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath35 .",
    "proposition 1 builds on corollary 2 by constructing a strong but non - trim triangular array representation starting from a trim strong one .",
    "proposition 2 , which also builds on some of the material from ( 3.1 ) , is a `` non - persistence '' result in that it shows that in any sequence @xmath58 of admissible permutations , @xmath22 never persists to be a subfunction of @xmath107 , and that in any trim strong triangular array representation @xmath108 of @xmath35 , for any @xmath27 , it is never possible for all of the @xmath17 to persist to be the corresponding @xmath109 .",
    "this provides another proof of the second consequence of the lil mentioned following question 1 in ( 1.1 ) and highlights some important ways in which the trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath35 must differ from the simple representation @xmath110 of @xmath6 .",
    "proposition 1 shows that trimness does not `` come for free '' .",
    "given that there can be no strong triangular array representation for @xmath16 in which each @xmath17 depends on only one bit , trimness is a natural `` next best hope '' .",
    "its central role in theorem 1 and corollary 1 is further evidence for its naturality , as is the following equivalent characterization of trimness , suggested by a. nerode .",
    "let @xmath111 be @xmath112 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the topological product of the @xmath111 equipped with the discrete topologies and let @xmath114 be the set of points of @xmath113 .",
    "suppose that for @xmath115 is a rademacher random variable on @xmath10 ( we are not necessarily assuming , yet , that @xmath116 is a triangular array nor that it represents @xmath16 ) .",
    "this provides us with a transformation , @xmath117 , from @xmath10 to @xmath114 , by taking @xmath118 .",
    "it is then clear that the condition : @xmath119 is equivalent to the condition : @xmath120 then , specializing to the situation where the @xmath121 _ do _ furnish a strong triangular array representation of @xmath16 , the second displayed formula provides our equivalent characterization of trimness .",
    "we are grateful to a. nerode for suggesting that we seek this type of characterization , and for the observation that the transformation @xmath117 can be feasibly implemented , since the implementation would satisfy a strong form of bounded memory ; this is an equivalent refomulation of the lipschitz continuity .      in ( 3.3 ) we introduce the natural encoding , @xmath122 of a sequence , @xmath123 , of admissible permutations , and explicitly begin to deal with complexity issues .",
    "it is here that we really begin to exploit the `` toolkit '' material developed in ( 3.1 ) .",
    "we prove proposition 3 , which establishes that the exponential function , @xmath24 , is a lower bound for the complexity of _",
    "any _ such sequence @xmath123 .",
    "our approach to this , and to related questions , will be briefly outlined in ( 1.3.5 ) , below and more fully discussed at the start of section 3 .",
    "while corollary 2 settles the question of the existence of trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath48 , in definition 4 ( ( 3.4 ) ) we explicitly construct the sequence @xmath124 of admissible permutations .",
    "building on proposition 4 and corollary 3 , theorem 2 answers question 3 affirmatively by establishing that @xmath125 , the natural encoding of this sequence , is p - time and can be simply computed in terms of sbc .",
    "we also give an even cleaner and simpler defining expression for @xmath24 in terms of @xmath125 , improving slightly on the proof of proposition 3 .",
    "the discussion of corollary 4 , proved in ( 3.5 ) , is deferred until ( 1.3.5 ) and section 3 .      the affirmative answer to question 4",
    "is provided by theorem 3 , proved in ( 4.2 ) . in ( 4.1 ) , culminating in definition 7 , we construct @xmath126 , a variant of the sequence , @xmath124 . among admissible permutations of @xmath127 , @xmath128 is maximal for agreement with the identity function .",
    "thus , the extent to which trim strong triangular array representations of @xmath16 _ must _ differ from the canonical representation of @xmath6 is measured by the extent to which the @xmath128 differ from the identity permutations .",
    "the construction of @xmath57 is also motivated by a rather different notion of complexity : that of an individual admissible permutation .",
    "this also motivates the construction of @xmath55 , the other variant of @xmath56 ( definition 11 of ( 4.1 ) ) .",
    "we impose additional natural properties on the @xmath128 and @xmath129 to guarantee that their orbit structures will be simpler than the orbit structures of the @xmath130 . while remark 6 and definition 7 immediately make it clear that each @xmath128 is admissible , this is a more substantial issue for the @xmath129 and is established in proposition 5 of ( 4.1 ) , the analogue for @xmath131 of remark 6 .",
    "the analogue of theorem 2 for the natural encodings , @xmath132 , of @xmath57 , and @xmath133 , of @xmath55 is provided by theorem 3 .",
    "the expression for @xmath24 in terms of @xmath132 is fairly close to the one in terms of @xmath125 , but for @xmath133 , we content ourselves with the general lower bound statement of proposition 3 .",
    "this difference between @xmath125 and @xmath132 , on the one hand , and @xmath133 , on the other , is foreshadowed by the discussion at the end of ( 3.5 ) , and revisited at the end of ( 4.1 ) .",
    "similar issues , also discussed at the end of ( 4.1 ) , are obstacles to obtaining a genuine analogue of corollary 4 for @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "the proof that each of @xmath132 and @xmath133 is p - time and is simply and explicitly computed in terms of sbc proceeds by analogy to theorem 2 , and follows the general approach sketched in ( 1.3.5 ) .",
    "this builds on proposition 6 , which plays the role of the combination of proposition 4 and corollary 3 .      for the lower bounds , established by equation ( 6 ) of proposition 3 , equation ( 8) of theorem 2 , and equation ( 13 ) of theorem 3 , the approach is to express @xmath24 explicitly and uniformly in @xmath18 , using the sum of at most @xmath18 values ( including repeated values ) of the function involved .",
    "all of the corresponding arguments are obtained from @xmath18 , very simply , explicitly , and uniformly in @xmath18 . in equation",
    "( 6 ) , there are @xmath18 distinct values involved , and the sum of these values is incremented by 1 to obtain @xmath24 . in equation ( 8) , for @xmath125 ,",
    "there is just one value , repeated twice . finally , for equation ( 13 ) , for @xmath132 , there is also just one value , repeated twice , but that value is the maximum of two values . in both of the latter cases ,",
    "@xmath24 is simply the sum of the repeated values ( i.e. , twice the repeated value , but the point is to do things using only addition and no multiplication ) .",
    "the proofs that @xmath134 and @xmath133 are p - time have a common structure , though the cases in the definitions of @xmath135 result in technical complications , especially for @xmath133 . here , accordingly , it is only for @xmath125 ( theorem 2 ) that we will outline the main ideas of the proof .    in subsections ( 3.1 ) and",
    "( 3.4 ) , we introduce the function sbc ( in definition 1 ) and a number of other auxiliary functions and relations , notably the two functions , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the function @xmath136 computes `` positions '' with respect to @xmath138 and is introduced in the comments following remark 1 , in ( 3.1 ) .",
    "we introduce @xmath137 in definition 5 of ( 3.4 ) .",
    "it is the enumerating function for @xmath139 ( definition 2 : the usual hamming weight of a positive integer ) .",
    "the sequence http://oeis.org , 2010 , sequence a066884 , [ [ oeis ] ] , encodes @xmath137 . @xmath136 bears the same relationship to @xmath16 as @xmath139 does to @xmath6 .    in subsection ( 3.4 ) ,",
    "proposition 4 establishes , among other things , that for all @xmath18 and all @xmath140 the computation of @xmath141 can be carried out using @xmath142 additions of integers all below @xmath24 , with all of the intermediate sums being less than @xmath24 .",
    "this guarantees that the function @xmath136 is p - time .    the corresponding result for the function @xmath137 is given by corollary 3 which also establishes that the relation expressed by equation ( 7 ) is p - time decidable .",
    "corollary 3 is the culmination of a sequence of results ( proposition 4 , lemmas 2 and 3 ) where the notion of `` tame '' relation , introduced in definition 3 , is a key ingredient .",
    "lemma 2 establishes that the enumerating function ( viz .",
    "definition 3 ) for a tame relation is p - time .",
    "lemma 3 establishes the tameness of the relation whose enumerating function is @xmath137 ( and thus , with lemma 2 , that @xmath137 is p - time ) .",
    "it follows from the proof of lemma 3 that @xmath137 itself can be simply computed in terms of sbc and that solutions , @xmath143 , of equation 7 can be computed in polynomial time as functions of @xmath18 and @xmath93 .",
    "the proof of theorem 2 then proceeds by showing that for @xmath27 and @xmath144 is the unique solution of equation ( 7 ) .",
    "we are very grateful to s. buss who provided invaluable assistance on several occasions .",
    "in particular , he confirmed the validity of our approach to proposition 4 , pointed out the references given there and supplied a very nice argument that evolved into the proof of lemma 3 .",
    "he also suggested combining these ideas with binary search ( a variant of the bisection algorithm ) .",
    "in the course of working out the details , we isolated the notion of tameness and formulated and proved lemma 2 .",
    "a bit more detail on the material of this subsubsection is given in the overview of section 3 .",
    "for @xmath0 , we set : @xmath145 @xmath146 on @xmath147 are constant .",
    "therefore , following the convention in the final paragraph of ( 1.3 ) , we denote these constant values by @xmath148 , respectively .    note that @xmath149 does not denote the kth component of a vector , @xmath150 , rather it denotes the vector ( a length @xmath18 bitstring ) itself .",
    "we will denote the @xmath151 component of this vector by @xmath152 .",
    "note that this is just @xmath153 for any @xmath154 .",
    "similar observations hold with @xmath155 in place of @xmath156 ( and @xmath157 replacing @xmath158 ) .",
    "note , further , that @xmath149 is the reversal of the binary representation of @xmath93 :  @xmath159 , and that @xmath160 enumerates @xmath161 in increasing order with respect to the lexicographic ordering . for @xmath162 ,",

    "of course the p - time decidability of @xmath216 can be established quite simply and directly from proposition 4 , but the approach taken is more efficient .    @xmath125 is p - time and simply computed in terms of sbc .",
    "we first argue for the lower complexity bound much as in proposition 3 , but with a slightly cleaner expression for @xmath24 given by equation ( 8) , below , rather than by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "we then show that @xmath125 is p - time ; the upper complexity bound then follows by the general argument given in ( 1.3.5 ) .",
    "we note : @xmath503 for equation ( 8) , the relevant observations are that @xmath18 is the largest element of @xmath504 is the largest element of @xmath404 and that for all @xmath505 maps @xmath212 onto @xmath213 in order - preserving fashion .",
    "the rest of the proof follows the strategy laid out in ( 1.3.5 ) . to see that @xmath125 is p - time we will argue that @xmath506    this is immediate from the last observation given in connection with equation ( 8) and clearly suffices to show that @xmath125 is p - time , in view of lemmas 2 , 3 and corollary 3 .",
    "that @xmath125 is simply computed in terms of sbc follows from equation ( 7 ) since all of the functions that figure there are simply computed in terms of sbc . for istep ,",
    "this is by item 1 . of remark 2 . for @xmath300 ,",
    "this is by item 2 . of remark 3 . for @xmath301 and @xmath484",
    "this is by the first paragraph following the proof of corollary 3 .",
    "we begin by showing how to obtain sbc from @xmath125 and @xmath225 ( the latter was also introduced in definition 4 ) .",
    "sbc is simply computed in terms of @xmath125 and @xmath225 .",
    "@xmath507 is simply computed in terms of sbc .",
    "thus , the joint complexity of @xmath125 and @xmath507 is exactly that of sbc .",
    "for the first assertion , recall that @xmath508 and note that @xmath509 .",
    "for @xmath38 , note that @xmath510 .",
    "but @xmath511 .    that @xmath225 is simply computable from sbc follows from the material of ( 3.4 ) , and in particular from the following `` dual version '' ( interchanging step and weight ) of equation 7 : @xmath512 as in ( 3.4 ) ,",
    "all of the functions in the previous displayed equation are simply computed from sbc , and , given @xmath513 , the unique solution , @xmath93 , is computed as @xmath514 , where @xmath515 .",
    "we can easily compute @xmath493 from sbc ( and ew ) using a binary search argument with initial interval @xmath516 $ ] .",
    "but this unique solution is just @xmath517 .",
    "the final assertion is immediate from the first two",
    ".    it would be ideal if we could show that sbc is simply computed from @xmath125 alone , since then the complexity of @xmath125 would be exactly that of sbc .",
    "the specific obstacle is being able to carry out the calculation of @xmath493 in the last sentence of the proof of the corollary in terms of @xmath125 alone , without the use of the binomial coefficient or the function ew .",
    "an indication that this obstacle may be serious is the general phenomenon that an inverse of a function , @xmath99 , can be significantly more complex than @xmath99 itself .",
    "symmetrically , if we could eliminate the use of @xmath125 to compute @xmath518 , it would follow that the complexity of @xmath225 is exactly that of sbc .",
    "this seems somewhat more feasible .",
    "we conclude this section by tieing up some `` odds and ends '' .",
    "we first argue that @xmath56 is the simplest sequence of admissible permutations , and so its corresponding triangular array representation is the simplest trim , strong triangular array representation for @xmath16 .",
    "finally , we make some observations concerning the contrast between equations ( 6 ) and ( 8) in light of this status of @xmath56 .",
    "remark 4 and the proof of item 2 . of lemma 1",
    "are the main elements of our argument that @xmath56 is the simplest sequence of admissible permutations .",
    "recall that each @xmath519 is the order - preserving bijection between @xmath520 and @xmath521 . while the claim that this is the simplest bijection between these sets may not be entirely clear , it is far clearer that the identity permutation on @xmath334 _ is _ the simplest permutation of this set . by remark 4 ,",
    "each @xmath522 is the identity permutation on @xmath334 and so from the point of view of the proof of lemma 1 and the subsequent paragraph , @xmath56 really is simplest , since it is represented by the system where each @xmath339 is the identity permutation .",
    "it should , however , be acknowledged that we have `` built in '' the role of the increasing enumerations in this way of representing admissible permutations .",
    "regarding the contrast between equations ( 6 ) and ( 8) , what is really at issue is to be able to easily identify @xmath523 as a function of @xmath18 , since , trivially , we ll always have that @xmath524 .",
    "for @xmath56 , equation ( 8) is based on the easy identification of @xmath525 as simply being @xmath526 .",
    "it is then natural to expect that for more complex sequences @xmath21 , the corresponding function @xmath525 will also be more complex , leaving us only equation ( 6 ) rather than a simple analogue of equation ( 8) . this has some features in common with the issues discussed in remark 5 , above .",
    "here we construct the variants , @xmath132 ( definition 7 ) and @xmath133 ( definition 11 ) , of @xmath125 .",
    "we impose additional requirements on the admissible permutations , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , respectively , that are to be encoded .",
    "the motivation for introducing these variants is to obtain sequences of permutations whose natural encodings are still p - time , with sbc as an upper complexity bound ( this will be the content of theorem 3 ) and where the orbit structures of the individual permutations are simpler than those of the @xmath130 .",
    "we construct the @xmath128 so as to maximize the number of fixed points .",
    "the construction of the @xmath129 goes farther : once all possible fixed points have been identified ( the same ones as for the @xmath128 ) , we maximize the number of two - cycles , so that the @xmath129 are as close as possible to being self - inverse .",
    "we construct the @xmath128 in two stages : we first note the fixed points are the elements of the @xmath527 .",
    "we then proceed much as for @xmath125 : for each @xmath38 , map `` what is left of '' @xmath212 in order preserving fashion onto `` what is left of '' @xmath213 .",
    "of course , this requires that these two sets have the same cardinality ; this will be obvious for the construction of @xmath128 , as noted in remark 6 .",
    "we construct the @xmath129 in three stages , with the first stage being identical to the first stage in the construction of the @xmath128 .",
    "we interpolate a new second stage , where we identify a maximal set of two - cycles .",
    "the third and final stage is analogous to the second stage in the definition of the @xmath128 , in that , for each @xmath38 , we map `` what is left of '' @xmath212 in order preserving fashion onto `` what is left of '' @xmath213 . this time ,",
    "`` what is left '' means after removing the fixed points _ and _ the points involved in the two - cycles identified in the second stage . as in the second stage of the construction of @xmath128 , in order to carry out the third and final stage for the @xmath129 , it must again be true that for each @xmath4 , `` what is left of '' @xmath212 has the same cardinality as `` what is left of '' @xmath213 .",
    "this is the content of proposition 5 .",
    "the constructions of the @xmath128 and of the @xmath129 will both be uniform in @xmath18 , so for the remainder of this subsection , we take @xmath18 to be fixed .",
    "the next definition is analogous to definition 2 .",
    "it introduces the @xmath528 and @xmath529 : `` what is left of @xmath212 , resp .",
    "@xmath213 '' , after removing the fixed points .      *",
    "we now invoke definition 3 with @xmath285 and @xmath286 and with * @xmath533 *  or * @xmath534 .",
    "_ this defines _ @xmath535 .",
    "we use @xmath536 to denote @xmath537 , respectively . _ the notation for the increasing enumerations will be _ @xmath538 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath128 is an admissible permutation of @xmath174 , with the additional property that @xmath128 is the identity on @xmath93 such that @xmath547 , i.e. , @xmath132 is maximal , among admissible permutations of @xmath174 , for agreement with the identity permutation .",
    "further , in analogy with remark 4 and ( 3.5 ) , we argue that @xmath132 is the simplest such admissible permutation .",
    "this is based on the analogues of the @xmath522 defined on @xmath548 , starting from @xmath549 .",
    "each of these is the identity on @xmath548 .",
    "we turn now to the definition of the @xmath129 and @xmath133 . once again",
    ", we will proceed in analogy with defintions 2 - 4 .",
    "our first task is to identify those @xmath93 which will be part of a two - cycle .    in order to motivate what follows ,",
    "suppose that @xmath50 is an admissible permutation of @xmath174 with the property we have built into @xmath128 : that @xmath550 whenever @xmath551 .",
    "suppose further that @xmath552 and @xmath553 .",
    "let @xmath554 .",
    "then @xmath555 .",
    "stated otherwise , we have that @xmath556 and @xmath557 .",
    "* we now invoke definition 3 with @xmath287 and @xmath562 and with * @xmath563 .",
    "_ this defines _ @xmath564 .",
    "we use @xmath565 to denote @xmath566 . _ the notation for the increasing enumerations will be _ @xmath567 .",
    "it would be natural to attempt to match up the elements of the @xmath570 with those of correspoding @xmath571 to form the two - cycles .",
    "however , the following example shows that even for fairly small @xmath18 , this will not be possible , since it can happen that for certain @xmath572 . when @xmath573 , we have : @xmath574 when @xmath575 there are various reasonable ways of choosing the @xmath576 elements of @xmath570 which will form 2-cycles with the elements of @xmath571 . the particular way we have chosen in what follows is to _ exclude _ the `` extreme '' elements of @xmath570 : those that are farthest from the elements of @xmath571 .",
    "this is codified in the next definition .",
    "* we now invoke definition 3 with @xmath287 and @xmath562 and with * @xmath580 .",
    "_ this defines _ @xmath581 .",
    "we use @xmath582 to denote @xmath583 . _ the notation for the increasing enumerations will be _ @xmath584 .      *",
    "we now invoke definition 3 with @xmath285 and @xmath286 and with * @xmath588*or * @xmath589 .",
    "_ this defines _ @xmath590 .",
    "we use @xmath591 to denote @xmath592 , respectively . _ the notation for the increasing enumerations will be _ @xmath538 .",
    "we note first that @xmath594 this follows from the definitions of the @xmath595 and the @xmath596 , and remark 7 .",
    "but then , since , by construction , @xmath597 , for all relevant @xmath598 , we have that @xmath599 finally , by construction , @xmath600 .",
    "it then clearly follows that @xmath601    we can now complete the construction of the @xmath129 .",
    "proposition 5 makes it clear that the third case of equation ( 12 ) , below , will provide a coherent definition and that the @xmath129 we define there are admissible permutations of @xmath174 with the additional property of @xmath128 .          with reference to the discussion in the final paragraph of ( 3.5 ) , related to the form of the lower bound expression , we should note here , that even for @xmath132 , the situation is somewhat more complicated : it may fail to be true that @xmath606 ( or , in the notation of the final paragraph of ( 3.5 ) , that @xmath607 ) : this will happen exactly if @xmath18 is is a power of 2 , since then @xmath608 and so @xmath609 . in this case , however , we ll have that @xmath610 .",
    "this is the basis for equation ( 13 ) , below , which is the analogue for @xmath132 of equation ( 8) .",
    "we have not carried out a similar analysis of the @xmath525 function for @xmath133 , and so , in the proof of theorem 3 , in ( 4.2 ) , we content ourselves with the general lower bound expression given by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "similar issues represent similar ( but even worse ) obstacles to obtaining an analogue of corollary 4 for @xmath132 or @xmath133 .",
    "the analogue of theorem 2 for the functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 is provided by theorem 3 .",
    "the lower bound statement argument divides , as just discussed , but things rejoin for the proof that @xmath132 and @xmath133 are p - time .",
    "proposition 6 is the main technical tool ; it incorporates the contributions of proposition 4 , lemma 2 , lemma 3 and corollary 3 in the proof of theorem 2 .      for each of the listed relations , the hypothesis of item 6 .",
    "of remark 3 clearly holds , and so it will suffice to establish tameness .",
    "we weave our way through the statements to be proved in the following order .",
    "first , the p - time decidability of the case condition of equation ( 10 ) , then the tameness of @xmath612 , then the p - time decidability of the second case condition of equation ( 12 ) and finally , the tameness of @xmath613 and @xmath614 . throughout the proof",
    "we will have @xmath320 with @xmath264 .    for the case condition of equation ( 10 ) ( and the first case condition of equation ( 12 ) ) , our starting point is proposition 4 , itself .",
    "the case condition is just whether @xmath615 : if so , then it is the first case of equations ( 10 ) , ( 12 ) of definitions 7 , 11 that applies : @xmath616 .",
    "it follows from proposition 4 that the relation expressed by the last displayed equation is p - time decidable .    for the tameness of @xmath617 , note that for each @xmath618 .",
    "recall that @xmath619 computes @xmath620 .",
    "it follows that @xmath621 .",
    "similarly , @xmath622 .",
    "thus , @xmath623 and so @xmath624 and @xmath625 are both p - time .",
    "therefore , @xmath626 are both tame .    for the tameness of @xmath627 ,",
    "just note that @xmath628 it follows that if @xmath302 then @xmath629 , and if @xmath630 then @xmath631 . finally , if @xmath632 , then @xmath633 .",
    "thus , @xmath565 is p - time and so @xmath627 is tame .",
    "note that by lemmas 2 and 3 , we have that @xmath634 is p - time , i.e. , for all relevant @xmath635 and all @xmath418 with @xmath636 is a p - time function of @xmath637 .    for the tameness of @xmath638 ,",
    "note that if @xmath639 , then @xmath640 . if @xmath641 and @xmath642 , let @xmath643 . if @xmath644 , then @xmath645 , while if @xmath646 , then @xmath647 . finally ,",
    "if @xmath575 and @xmath648 , let @xmath649 . if @xmath650 , then @xmath651 , while if @xmath652 , then @xmath653 .",
    "thus , @xmath582 is p - time , and so @xmath638 is tame , and therefore is p - time decidable .",
    "we mention this explicitly only because it is exactly the second case condition of equation ( 12 ) .    finally , we show that @xmath654 and @xmath614 are tame . for @xmath654 , if @xmath655 , note : @xmath656 if @xmath302 , then @xmath657 ; otherwise : @xmath658 and so @xmath654 is tame .",
    "for @xmath614 , we have the analogous observation : for @xmath655 @xmath659 then , @xmath660 , so @xmath614 is tame .",
    "as already indicated , we do not attempt to improve on equation ( 6 ) for the lower bound statement for @xmath133 . for @xmath132 , however , we do note that @xmath661 .",
    "thus , @xmath662 is the largest element of @xmath663 , and so if @xmath664 , then @xmath93 is the largest element of @xmath665 . as noted at the end of ( 4.1 ) , possibly @xmath666 ( if @xmath18 is a power of 2 ) , but , if @xmath666 , then @xmath667 ( since @xmath668 is the only pair of consecutive 2-powers ) .",
    "thus , our analogue of equation ( 8) for @xmath132 is : @xmath669 turning to the proof that @xmath132 and @xmath133 are p - time , we know , by proposition 6 , that the case conditions are p - time decidable , and that in the first case we have @xmath616 . for each of the remaining cases ( case 2 , for @xmath132 and cases 2 , 3 , for @xmath133 ) ,",
    "we exhibit p - time decidable relations involving @xmath488 whose unique solution , @xmath143 , is less than @xmath24 , is p - time and is the value of @xmath670 ( resp .",
    "@xmath671 ) as determined by the case in question .",
    "this is done in equations ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) .    for readability",
    ", we will use @xmath4 as an abbreviation for @xmath248 in each of these equations , and in equation ( 15 ) , we will also use @xmath672 as an abbreviation for @xmath246 , but the relations expressed by these equations really involve only @xmath673 .",
    "the p - time computability of the unique solutions depends on proposition 6 , and on lemma 2 ( for the p - time computability of the relevant enumerating function ) and will be established by exhibiting an equation that specifies the computation .",
    "the argument that each of @xmath682 is simply computed in terms of sbc is similar to that in theorem 2 , and involves the straightforward verification that all of the functions involved in equations ( 14 ) , ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) are simply computed in terms of sbc .",
    "this traces back to examining the proof of proposition 6 .",
    "each of @xmath536 is explicitly and simply computed in terms of @xmath683 and sbc .",
