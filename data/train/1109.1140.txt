    "although a different grain size distribution would result in different @xmath6 , we choose to adopt the one prescribed by the dl07 models as they can successfully reproduce the ir and submillimeter emission for a sample of sings galaxies ( including both normal and starburst galaxies ) .",
    "we also fit the seds of our sources with the standard form of a single temperature ( @xmath50 ) modified black body , leaving the effective emissivity ( @xmath51 ) as a free parameter along with the dust temperature ( @xmath50 ) . for the fit",
    "we only consider data points with @xmath52 m , to avoid emission from very small grains and from the best fit model we can then estimate the @xmath6  from the relation : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the observed flux density , @xmath55 is the luminosity distance and @xmath56 = @xmath57 is the rest frame dust mass absorption coefficient at the observed wavelength ( li & draine 2001 ) .",

    "having derived estimates for the @xmath6  values of our sources , we need information on their metallicities , for which we have to rely on indirect indicators . one of these is the @xmath82 @xmath36 metallicity relation of erb et al .",

    "a similar derivation would follow using the fundamental metallicity relation ( fmr ) of mannucci et al .",

    "furthermore , carilli et al . (",
    "2010 ) , based on the co[1@xmath360 ] transition line , estimated the gas mass of gn20 to be @xmath1  = 1.3 @xmath59 10@xmath103 @xmath59 ( @xmath2/0.8 ) m@xmath8 , putting a coarse upper limit on the conversion factor of @xmath2  @xmath24 from dynamical constraints .",

    "3 ( left ) based on the @xmath1  estimates from the literature , indicates that bzk-21000 is very close to the relation defined by a linear regression fit to the local sample .",
    "similarly , gn20 appears to broadly follow the local trend .",
    "another way to show that the @xmath0@xmath105 relation holds for high - z galaxies , is to plot direct observables , without any assumptions for @xmath2 . indeed , in fig .",
    "3 ( right ) , we plot @xmath18/@xmath6  vs metallicity for our sample and find again that both gn20 and bzk21000 follow the local trend . finally , recent results from genzel et al .",
    "( 2011 ) seem to verify our assumption .    despite the substantial uncertainties ,",
    "the agreement with independent @xmath2  estimates is reassuring .",
    "in the local universe there is observational and theoretical evidence that @xmath2  in starburst galaxies is significantly smaller than that in the milky way disk ( downes & solomon 1998 ; scoville et al .",
    "the derived conversion factor for gn20 is consistent with that of local ulirgs or even lower , while for bzk-21000 the value is considerably higher and close to that of local spirals .",
    "we stress that without the addition of the mm data , the large uncertainties in @xmath6  would not allow us to derive any meaningful conclusions . furthermore , although the sources appear to have comparable @xmath21/@xmath18  @xmath106 l@xmath8  ( k km s@xmath13 pc@xmath107)@xmath13 , their sfes , are considerably different . in particular , for bzk-21000 we derive a sfe @xmath15 while for gn20 sfe @xmath108 ( depending on the assumed metallicity).the two sources also have comparable @xmath109/@xmath6  @xmath106 .",
    "this is also the case for local ulirgs and normal sdss galaxies ( da cunha et al .",
    "2010 ) , supporting the idea that the property that distinguishes starbursts from normal star - forming galaxies is their enhanced sfr ( at fixed @xmath1 , @xmath6  and @xmath109 ) .",
    "we conclude by noting that our results , although limited to two sources , are in line with previous claims that the star - formation mode of bzk-21000 and other high@xmath25 galaxies in the main sequence of the sfr@xmath36m@xmath110 plane is different than that of most smgs , and more similar to that of local - disks , despite their very large infrared luminosities and star formation rates .",
    "additionally , we confirm the validity of the widely adopted ulirg - like @xmath2  factor for smgs ( e.g. , tacconi et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the combination of _ herschel _  with ground based millimetre data provides a powerful tool to investigate the dust and gas properties of high@xmath25 galaxies .",

    "<S> we explore the gas - to - dust mass ratio ( @xmath0 ) and the co luminosity - to-@xmath1  conversion factor ( @xmath2 ) of two well studied galaxies in the goods - n field , that are expected to have different star forming modes , the starburst gn20 at @xmath3 and the normal star - forming galaxy bzk-21000 at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> detailed sampling is available for their rayleigh - jeans emission via ground based mm interferometry ( @xmath5 mm ) along with _ herschel _  </S>",
    "<S> pacs and spire data that probe the peak of their infrared emission . using the physically motivated draine & li ( 2007 ) models , as well as a modified black body function , </S>",
    "<S> we measure the dust mass ( @xmath6 ) of the sources and find @xmath7 m@xmath8  for gn20 and @xmath9 m@xmath8  for bzk-21000 . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of mm data reduces the uncertainties of the derived @xmath6  by a factor of @xmath10 , allowing the use of the local @xmath0  vs metallicity relation to place constraints on the @xmath2  values of the two sources . for gn20 </S>",
    "<S> we derive a conversion factor of @xmath2  @xmath11 1.0 m@xmath8  pc@xmath12(k km s@xmath13)@xmath13 , consistent with that of local ulirgs , while for bzk-21000 we find a considerably higher value , @xmath2  @xmath14 m@xmath8pc@xmath12(k km s@xmath13)@xmath13 , in agreement with an independent kinematic derivation reported previously . </S>",
    "<S> the implied star formation efficiency is @xmath15 l@xmath16/m@xmath16 for bzk-21000 , a factor of @xmath17 lower than that of gn20 . </S>",
    "<S> the findings for these two sources support the existence of different disk - like and starburst star - formation modes in distant galaxies , although a larger sample is required to draw statistically robust results . </S>"
