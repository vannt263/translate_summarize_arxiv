    "in a _ drawing _ of a graph in the plane , each vertex is represented by a point and each edge is represented by a simple open arc , such that if @xmath17 is an edge , then the closure ( in the plane ) of the arc @xmath18 representing @xmath17 consists precisely of @xmath18 and the points representing @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is further required that no arc representing an edge contains a point representing a vertex .",

    "a drawing is _ good _ if ( i ) no three distinct arcs representing edges meet at a common point ; ( ii ) if two edges are adjacent , then the arcs representing them do not intersect each other ; and ( iii ) an intersection point between two arcs representing edges is a crossing rather than tangential .",
    "it is well - known ( and easy to prove ) that every graph has a crossing - minimal drawing which is good ( moreover , ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold in _ every _ crossing - minimal drawing ) .",

    "<S> around 1958 , hill described how to draw the complete graph @xmath0 with @xmath1 crossings , and conjectured that the crossing number @xmath2 of @xmath0 is exactly @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this is also known as guy s conjecture as he later popularized it . towards the end of the century , </S>",
    "<S> substantially different drawings of @xmath4 with @xmath3 crossings were found . </S>",
    "<S> these drawings are _ 2-page book drawings _ , that is , drawings where all the vertices are on a line @xmath5 ( the spine ) and each edge is fully contained in one of the two half - planes ( pages ) defined by  @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> 2-page crossing number _ of @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 , is the minimum number of crossings determined by a 2-page book drawing of @xmath4 . since @xmath8 and @xmath9 , a natural step towards hill s conjecture is the weaker conjecture @xmath10 , popularized by vrto . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we develop a novel and innovative technique to investigate crossings in drawings of @xmath4 , and use it to prove that @xmath11 . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the inherent geometric definition of @xmath12-edges for finite sets of points in the plane to topological drawings of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also introduce the concept of @xmath13-edges as a useful generalization of @xmath14-edges and extend a powerful theorem that expresses the number of crossings in a rectilinear drawing of @xmath4 in terms of its number of @xmath15-edges to the topological setting . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we give a complete characterization of crossing minimal 2-page book drawings of @xmath4 and show that , up to equivalence , they are unique for @xmath16 even , but that there exist an exponential number of non - homeomorphic such drawings for @xmath16 odd . </S>"
