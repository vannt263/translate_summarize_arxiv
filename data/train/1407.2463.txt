    "frustrated magnetism is a subject that has attracted much attention in the last decades . from the quantum mechanical perspective , frustration is the key element in the search of exotics ground states , like spin liquids .",
    "@xcite very often , low - energy effective models , such as quantum dimer models , are used to get a better understanding of the physics of such frustrated systems . in non - bipartite lattices , they provide maybe the most controllable examples of states that can be assimilated to spin liquids  @xcite for a finite range of parameters , while for bipartite lattices only the rokhsar - kivelson point displays a disordered ( critical ) state .",
    "@xcite these exotic spin liquid states have the interesting property of topological degeneracy , which can not be identified with a local order parameter .",
    "it is related to a long - range entanglement of the ground state @xcite .    from the classical statistical mechanics perspective",
    ", frustrated systems have attracted also a lot of interest because of the phenomenon of order by disorder ( obd ) .",
    "@xcite it is by now well understood that obd is the mechanism that gives rise to a ground - state selection among a continuously degenerate manifold in classical frustrated magnets such as the heisenberg model on the kagom  @xcite or the pyrochlore @xcite lattices .",
    "such systems present `` soft modes '' in their spin - wave spectra , and the configurations with the most soft modes will be favored entropically at low but non - zero temperature , against configurations with the same energy but less soft modes .",
    "@xcite the straightforward extension of the ideas of obd to quantum mechanics is simply to argue that , among many configurations with the same classical energy , the one that has the lowest zero - point energy quantum correction is selected , and a wide number of models on different lattices have been studied in this way  @xcite or sometimes going beyond harmonic level if needed .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we are going to argue that the phenomenon of classical obd may be revealed in another and more subtle way .",
    "the symptoms of obd that we discuss here can in some sense be found in the existing literature although they have not been enough emphasized in our opinion .",
    "more interestingly , they go somehow in the opposite direction of long - range entanglement in topological gapped quantum spin liquids .",
    "@xcite indeed , high frustration may lead to ground - state wave functions that are , to a large extent , factorizable into local states ( i.e. a product state ) . the work of schulenburg _",
    "et al_.  @xcite for the kagom lattice provides an exact result in which highly frustrated magnets in the presence of a strong magnetic field have a factorizable wave function consisting in a collection of localized magnons when the system is close to saturation .",
    "this was later shown to be also the case for several lattices like the sawtooth chain , the checkerboard and pyrochlore lattices .",
    "@xcite although there is no exact result , the heisenberg model on the kagom lattice at its @xmath0 plateau is expected to have a wave function with a large overlap to a factorizable toy wave function .",
    "@xcite a consequence of this is the fact that the relative magnetization between different sites of the lattice , or spin imbalance , is locked to a fixed value ; for example , in the case of the kagom lattice , the total magnetization of a resonating hexagon , is fixed to an integer value as compared to the magnetization of the fully polarized spins surrounding the hexagon .    to provide a better and more concrete understanding of the statements above , we are going to study the system which is certainly the simplest prototype to reveal such an interesting phenomenology : the frustrated four - leg spin tube . a first argument in favor of this system",
    "is its one - dimensional ( 1d ) nature allowing to use powerful nonperturbative analytical and numerical techniques .",
    "obviously , the chosen system gives rise at the classical level to the phenomenon of obd and , as we are going to show , produces in a quite explicit way all the phenomenology we have mentioned above : a mechanism to lead the factorization of the ground state and the quantization of the order parameter .",
    "a second argument in favor of this model is the fact that it possesses magnetization plateaus , a common consequence of frustration but not necessary the most interesting one for the point we want to make here .",
    "indeed , it is interesting to locate in a magnetization plateau and then focus on the fate of nonmagnetic excitations , which are going to be the principal actors of the desired physics .",
    "last but not least , the four - leg tube is somehow the parent system of the three - leg spin tube , which has been extensively studied ( see for example ref .   and references therein ) and is also a frustrated system showing the presence of magnetization plateaus .",
    "however , it does not have classical obd and therefore does not give rise to the phenomenology in which we are interested here .",
    "it will play the role of a reference example to compare our results .",

    "it may share some common properties with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) pyrochlore lattice . since our model is in 1d and strongly frustrated",
    ", we have a particular interest in its nonmagnetic properties .",
    "such nonmagnetic features naturally emerge in the pyrochlore lattice built on coupled tetrahedra , since the triplet excitations are fully gapped in the decoupled limit .",
    "this model has been originally studied in the theoretical literature @xcite but recently proposed experimentally .",
    "@xcite although our model is apparently far from the experimental realization , it is easily tractable and then will be a simplest starting point to explore those 3d candidates in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "another remarkable feature of this model is the exact macroscopic degeneracy of the disordered ground state at the quantum level even after introducing tiny couplings between tetrahedra .",
    "in fact , this model can be mapped onto an su(2 ) ferromagnet . by perturbing this `` hidden '' ferromagnet with additional couplings ,",
    "a factorizable nonmagnetic ordered state is selected , as expected from our discussion about the obd mechanism .",
    "we finally mention that another model of the frustrated four - leg spin tube has been studied recently .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : path_integral ] , we use a large-@xmath17 path - integral approach to discuss the obd phenomenon with the computation of the zero - point energy .",
    "we propose the emergence of quantized spin - imbalance phases .",

    "[ sec : num ] , we compare our predictions to density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) simulations . sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to the summary of our results and conclusion . in appendix",
    "[ sec : appendixa ] , several details on the strong - coupling analysis are supplemented .",
    "in this section , we present a semi - classical analysis of the model ( [ eq:4leg_tube_ham ] ) and show the occurrence of a ground - state selection by an obd mechanism .",
    "@xcite indeed , we will see that the classical ground state of this model is continuously degenerate with the presence of a free angle variable .",
    "an important question is then to know which value of this angle is selected by the quantum fluctuation , or alternatively by the thermal fluctuations .",
    "it turns out that , in our case , these two kinds of fluctuation seems to act in a different manner .",
    "we finally discuss how the question of the tunneling between the different favored states arise and its consequences .",
    "we follow a method recently developed by tanaka , totsuka , and hu .",
    "@xcite they used a haldane s path - integral approach based on the spin coherent state  @xcite .",
    "haldane s analysis leads to an action comprising two terms .",
    "@xcite one is the coherent - state expectation value of the hamiltonian , or simply the hamiltonian for the classical configuration .",
    "the other term is the berry phase one and corresponds to the surface area ( or the solid angle ) , @xmath18\\partial_{\\tau}\\varphi(\\tau)$ ] in spherical coordinates , enclosed by each spin during its imaginary - time @xmath19 evolution .    in order to build a low - energy effective theory from this starting point ,",
    "one proceeds by first identifying the classical solution , @xmath20 and then adding the quantum fluctuation on top of it , @xmath21 we then expand the spin components up to second order in @xmath22 .",
    "the calculation of the su(2 ) commutation relations @xmath23",

    "it ensures to have the correct commutators for the spin operators .",
    "then we rewrite these operators as functions of the conjugate fluctuation variables , @xmath27}s\\bigg[\\sin \\theta^{(0)}_{i , j } - \\frac{m}{s\\sin \\theta^{(0)}_{i , j}}\\pi_{i , j } , \\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{s^2}{s^2-m^2}\\frac{1}{s\\sin \\theta^{(0)}_{i , j}}\\pi_{i , j}^2\\bigg]\\\\   s^z_{i , j } & = s \\cos \\theta^{(0)}_{i , j}+\\pi_{i , j}.   \\end{split } \\label{eq : pi_spin_operators}\\ ] ] inspecting the expression of @xmath28 , it is clear that @xmath24 represents the fluctuation around the classical magnetization per site , @xmath29 .",
    "the action is then rewritten in a function of these variables at the second order .      from now on we focus on the regime @xmath30 . for @xmath31 , @xmath14 , and @xmath32 , the ground state on a rung",
    "is determined by the unique condition @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "this leads to a continuous degeneracy of two angles in each rung .",
    "this is the same situation as the pyrochlore lattice as both systems share the same elementary cell .",
    "@xcite if we add the magnetic field , there is the additional magnetization condition @xmath36 and only one of the two angles remains free . the ground state is then given by equally canting the four spins along the field and by making two pairs of antiparallel spins in the perpendicular @xmath37 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_classgs ] ) .",
    "the energy is independent of the angle @xmath38 between the two spins 1 and 2 projected onto the @xmath37 plane , thus in the decoupled rung limit we have one free angle per rung .    ) .",
    "the four spins make a total spin zero in the @xmath37 plane perpendicular to the field , where a free angle @xmath38 is present ( left panel ) , and are equally canted along the magnetic field in the @xmath10 direction ( right panel).,scaledwidth=46.0% ]    coupling the rungs with a non - zero @xmath6 , only one free angle remains while we can accommodate a @xmath39 state along the chain for the spin components in the @xmath37 plane ( @xmath40 is the momentum along the chain ) .",
    "this angle is nothing but the continuous degeneracy that we discussed above .",
    "therefore on top of the usual @xmath41 symmetry , we end up with an extra continuous degeneracy for the classical ground state .",
    "we want to emphasize that , because this angle is not associated with the symmetry of the hamiltonian , we expect the quantum and thermal fluctuations to necessarily select , through an obd mechanism , somes states with the corresponding angles minimizing the free energy of the system .",
    "we parametrize the classical solution with @xmath42 , and @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that by chosing such a parametrization we have broken a @xmath44 symmetry .",
    "indeed , we are at the point @xmath14 with the @xmath16 symmetry group .",
    "thus , instead of choosing sites 1 and 3 to be antiparallel as we did here , we could have chosen any of the three spins 2 , 3 , or 4 to be paired with the spin 1 , that we consider as fixed .",
    "once this choice is made , let us comment briefly about some differences depending on the value of @xmath38 , which has a periodicity of @xmath45 and that we define as the angle between spins 1 and 2 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pi_classgs ] , we see that the cases @xmath46 and @xmath47 lead both to two distinct states , while for a generic value of @xmath38 there are four non - equivalent states with values of the angle between spins 1 and 2 taking the values @xmath48 .    to distinguish between those four states , we propose to use the following couple of operators @xmath49 the operator",
    "@xmath50 is the usual measure of the @xmath10-component of the spin vector chirality , and the @xmath51 operator is discussed in the strong - coupling analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : strong_coupling ] where these operators will be of great use .",
    "computing their values in the four states for a generic @xmath38 , we get @xmath52 where @xmath53 and those are always nonzero .    when @xmath54 , those states remain ground states .",
    "the only difference is that we do no longer have the three possibilities when anti - aligning a spin with the spin 1 , thus the above discussion also applies to this regime .",
    "finally , we discuss the symmetry relations between the four states when @xmath38 takes a generic value .",
    "as we have chosen the sites 1 and 3 to be antiparallel , we can consider only the symmetry operations of @xmath55 the symmetry group of the tube for @xmath54 .",

    "we plug this ground - state solution in the expressions ( [ eq : pi_spin_operators ] ) and cast these expressions in the action . up to the second order in the fields",
    ", we obtain in the continuum limit the following action , @xmath68 where @xmath69 denotes the lattice constant .",

    ", we see that this @xmath78 field corresponds to moving together spins 1 and 3 on one hand and spins 2 and 4 on the other hand .",
    "we recover the fact that classically this deformation has no energy cost .",
    "however , as pointed out previously , this free angle does not arise from the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath41 symmetry is encoded in the symmetric @xmath80 field , thus we do not expect this action to reflect the true behavior of the @xmath78 field . at higher ordres , a localizing potential",
    "is thus required such that the unphysical free - field nature @xmath78 appearing in the action is removed .",
    "its shape , or more precisely its number of minima , is given by the form of the free energy as a function of @xmath38 , with two or four minima ( see the discussion of the classical ground state ) .",
    "in addition , inspecting eq .  , we point out that some values of @xmath38 play a particular role .",
    "we remark that , if @xmath14 , for @xmath81 ( resp .",
    "@xmath82 ) , the two fields @xmath83 and @xmath84 decouples as @xmath85 while at the same time the mass term @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) vanishes .",
    "thus we end with the field @xmath84 ( @xmath83 ) to be also massless while the other @xmath83 @xmath88 retains a mass term .",
    "the explanation is the same than for the @xmath78 field because , when @xmath14 and only in that case , we can make a deformation with no energy cost by pairing spins 1 and 4 ( 1 and 2 ) and spins 2 and 3 ( 3 and 4 ) .",
    "following exactly the same reasoning as above , we expect a localizing potential at higher orders .",
    "another couple of special points is @xmath47 . indeed in that case",
    "all the coefficients of the fields @xmath83 and @xmath84 are equal .",
    "we can then , as for the three - leg spin tube model  @xcite , introduce two conjugate fields @xmath89 and @xmath90 , which represent the chirality degrees of freedom . despite the presence of a mass term @xmath91 ,",
    "the imaginary - time derivative term has been shown to have strong effects , and in particular to allow the possible appearance of gapless phases for @xmath92 .",

    "the staggered spin imbalance comes from an operator @xmath313 perturbing an xxz model in the bosonization picture  @xcite , and in that case nothing prevents the associated staggered @xmath314 field to fluctuate .",
    "we also briefly numerically studied the various magnetization plateaus for @xmath242 and @xmath208 at very small longitudinal coupling .",
    "it revealed the presence , for every plateau , of @xmath39 spin imbalance phases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spinimbalance_s1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : spinimbalance_s32 ] ) displaying the same quantization phenomenon .",
    "even though we can not rely on an effective hamiltonian , we noticed that , except for two plateaus , two of the spins are always polarized to @xmath294 while the magnetization of the two others progressively decreases as @xmath11 is lowered .",
    "it indicates that the ground state can also be written as a product state and that the fluctuation of the spin imbalance is again strongly suppressed .",
    "it is however not evident how this delocalization happens if we start from the model ( [ eq:4leg_tube_ham ] ) .",
    "physically , it is obvious that the @xmath309 field should pick up a mass term @xmath315 and a straightforward calculation with the doubled unit cell confirms it .",
    "a possible explanation is that the staggered state observed is in fact representative of a modified hamiltonian , and the model we study here is not sufficient in the semi - classical approach . on the other hand",
    ", one can see that adding an extra term @xmath316 in the hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ including longitudinal `` twisted '' couplings , would favour the homogeneous spin imbalance . a quick calculation for @xmath54 shows",
    "that the factor in front of the ising model ( [ eq : ham_tauxtaux ] ) is changed to @xmath317 .",
    "this new term adds more frustration to the problem and the two spin imbalance phases compete . in the semi - classical approach ,",
    "its effect is in particular to reduce the mass of the @xmath133 term in the action ( [ eq : pi_action2 ] ) as @xmath318 .",
    "as this prefactor is reduced , it is likely that the gaussian order is not sufficient to capture correctly the behavior of the @xmath133 field . beyond our second - order calculation",
    ", new terms are expected to appear and favor the pinning of the field to nonzero values .    as a final remark",
    ", it is worth highlighting the direct link between the continuous degeneracy present at the classical level and its consequences on the quantum system . for a generic unfrustrated system , in the path - integral formulation the presence of a magnetization plateau",
    "is explained by the delocalization of the angular field representing the goldstone mode ( the @xmath80 field here ) . as a consequence ,",
    "its conjugate is locked ( to zero ) and a plateau appears . usually , this scenario is not expected to happen for other fields . in the model studied here , we have the unusual situation in which soft modes , typical of highly frustrated systems , behave in some sense as supplementary goldstone modes , although strictly speaking they are not . despite the fact that no symmetry protects them to have a localizing potential",
    ", frustration can make this effective potential weak enough to be overcome by tunneling effects .",
    "then , these soft or pseudo goldstone modes can experience a proliferation of vortices , as for the real goldtsone mode , and delocalize .",
    "this has the effect of pinning the conjugate variable , which in the case at hand is directly related to the observed spin imbalance as we explained above .",
    "the relation between a magnetization plateau and the delocalization of the goldstone mode is in fact not at all specific to one dimensional systems .  @xcite neither is the presence of soft modes ( within the spin wave description ) in frustrated magnets , as it is for example the case for the kagom lattice  @xcite .",
    "we have then good reasons to expect a similar kind of behavior in higher dimensional frustrated magnetic models , with the same phenomenology involved , that is , locking of spin imbalance and a ground state wave function which is very close to a product state . in that sense ,",
    "the model studied here is a very good representative example of a wide family of highly frustrated magnets which present a very particular manifestation of the classical order by disorder at the quantum level , which goes beyond the most intuitive expectation , namely , a selection mechanism similar to the classical case .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the behavior of a frustrated four - leg spin tube under a magnetic field . as expected",
    ", the system shows the presence of magnetization plateaus for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we have focused on the behavior of the system at the magnetization plateaus as it presents an interesting behavior that can be traced back to the presence of frustration .",
    "we used a combination of a path - integral approach , the analysis of strong - coupling effective hamiltonians , and the dmrg method .",
    "the numerical results from dmrg show two intriguing properties of the ground state when sitting on the magnetization plateaus , namely : ( i ) the appearance of a spin imbalance which is locked to integer values , ( ii ) an almost perfect factorization of the ground state wave function .",
    "moreover , we expect that the property ( i ) is a consequence of ( ii ) .    in the highest plateau , where the number of nonmagnetic degrees of freedom per rung is small enough , a relatively simple low - energy effective hamiltonian can be constructed .",
    "the analysis of the effective hamiltonian confirms the behavior described above .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at the most frustrated point , the effective hamiltonian calculated to first order is equivalent , via a nonlocal transformation , to a spin-@xmath319 ferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "the macroscopic degeneracy of the ground state is lifted by the higher - order corrections to the effective hamiltonian .",
    "it is , in principle , not evident at all that the higher - order corrections give rise to the ( almost ) factorization properties of the corresponding six - fold degenerate ground state .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that the staggered correlation function , corresponding to a string correlation function via the nonlocal transformation , is almost saturated , indicating indeed a factorized structure .",
    "last but not least , we would like to insist that , in fact , the above scenario is also reproduced for other plateaus where the effective hamiltonian is more complicated , because of the presence of more low - energy ( non - magnetic ) degrees of freedom .",
    "although no tractable effective hamiltonian is available in the general case , it can be seen in the numerical results and argued as a delocalization of a pseudo goldstone mode corresponding to the canonical conjugate variable to the spin imbalance .",
    "states having the properties ( i ) and ( ii ) were already shown to be exact ground states in a wide variety of frustrated systems @xcite , but in fact this property remains almost intact to a very large extent even when the ground state can not be obtained exactly .",
    "@xcite increasing further the magnetization on those systems may either imply a jump in the magnetization curve ( as it happen in ref .  ) or simply a delocking of the spin imbalance which is due to the onset of quasi - long - range order ( or just simply long - range order in higher dimensions ) associated with the true goldstone mode enforcing itself a localization of the pseudo goldstone mode conjugate to the spin imbalance .",
    "we thank m. oshikawa for fruitful discussions .",
    "y.f . was supported in part by the program for leading graduate schools , mext , japan .",
    "numerical simulations were performed at calmip and genci . y.f . also thanks the hospitality of laboratoire de physique thorique , ups and cnrs , where this work was completed .",
    "we here explain the hidden su(2 ) symmetry in the first - order effective hamiltonian in sec .  [",
    "sec : scham ] under the obc .",
    "as shown by kennedy  @xcite , any spin-1 hamiltonian with short - range interactions , @xmath321 and @xmath322 , can be mapped onto some hamiltonian written in terms of short - range bilinear interactions of three anticommuting operators by a nonlocal unitary transformation .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath323 satisfy the anticommutation relation @xmath324 where @xmath325 is any permutation of @xmath326 .",
    "since the first - order effective hamiltonian   is precisely in the latter form , we can conversely use his result and obtain some spin-1 hamiltonian .",
    "the desired nonlocal unitary transformation has been proposed in ref .   and written as a product of two unitary operators @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the nonlocal one found by kennedy and tasaki  @xcite , @xmath329 and @xmath330 is a product of local unitary operators , @xmath331 under this transformation @xmath332 , the bilinear operators are transformed as @xmath333 and the hamiltonian   is exactly mapped onto the spin-1 heisenberg ferromagnetic chain , @xmath334 under the obc .",
    "once we concern the second - order perturbation as in eq .  , the transformed hamiltonian no longer exhibits the exact su(2 ) symmetry but still remains a local form .",
