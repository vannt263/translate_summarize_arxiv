    "we report on the detection at high spectral resolution of h@xmath0   in the spectrum of the lmc star lh10:3120 .",
    "the star , located in the association lh10 near the western edge of the lmc , is of spectral type o5.5vf , has @xmath11 mag and @xmath12 mag ( parker et  al .",
    "the star was selected because of its very early spectral type , modest extinction ( too large extinction would make the far - uv undetectable ) , and its proximity to an area where the molecule co has been found in emission ( cohen et  al .   1988 ; israel et  al .",

    "the presence of h@xmath0  in the lmc is known since israel & koornneef ( 1988 ) detected the near - ir emission lines from radiatively excited h@xmath0  seen toward hii  regions near hot stars .",

    "the spectrum has been filtered by us with a de - noising algorithm basing on a wavelet transformation ( fligge & solanki 1997 ) .",
    "this leads to a slight degradation of the spectral resolution , now being equivalent to @xmath16 kms@xmath17 .",
    "the spectra have a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of @xmath18 at the longer wavelengths of the recorded spectral range . toward the shorter end of the spectral range",
    ", both the increased effect of the uv - extinction as well as the wavelength dependent sensitivity of the instrument leads to a reduction in s / n such , that little can be done with the spectrum at @xmath19  .",

    "the reason for this is to avoid getting confused in the search for h@xmath0  by the complexity of the absorption line profiles on the line of sight to the lmc .",
    "yet , the characteristic pattern of absorption by the milky way disk near 0 kms@xmath17 , by the lmc near + 270 kms@xmath17 , and possibly by high - velocity clouds near + 60 and + 130 kms@xmath17   all known from _ iue _ ( see savage & de boer 1979 , 1981 ; de boer et  al .   1980 ) and _ hst _ ( bomans et  al .",
    "1995 ) spectra , helps to identify the absorption structures .",
    "a section of the echelle order 51 , where several h@xmath0  aborption lines have been found , is shown in fig.1 .",
    "many of the h@xmath0  profiles overlap in their @xmath25300 kms@xmath17   wide profile structure and decompositions are not always possible .",
    "however , in some cases the galactic absorption stayed unblended , in other cases the lmc portion was blend free . for this first analysis we took 16 h@xmath0  absorption lines from the lowest 5 rotational states for the further analysis .",
    "these lines are essentially free from any blending problems so that wrong identifications can be excluded .",
    "absorption strengths could thus be determined for the lmc components seen in these absorption profiles .",
    "a selection of characteristic h@xmath0  absorption line profiles in velocity scale ( lsr ) is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the absorption profiles have been analysed and decomposed into the various velocity components . here",
    "we limit ourselves to the absorption pertaining to the lmc . for each line",
    "the absorption equivalent width has been determined .",
    "the @xmath26-values for the further analysis have been taken from morton & dinerstein ( 1976 ) for the h@xmath0  transitions and for the atomic absorption lines from the compilation of morton ( 1991 ) .",
    "theoretical voigt profiles were fitted to some of the identified h@xmath0  absorption lines and we thus could derive an upper limit for the velocity dispersion of @xmath27 kms@xmath17  for the lmc gas .",
    "subsequently , curves of growth have been constructed for each of the absorptions by the 5 rotational states for the lmc component .",
    "the logarithmic equivalent widths for each rotational level @xmath22 have been shifted horizontally to give a fit to a theoretical single cloud curve of growth as a function of log @xmath28 .",
    "the best fit for all 5 rotational states was obtained with @xmath29 kms@xmath17   as shown in the empirical curve of growth for all identified h@xmath0  lines ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the column densities @xmath30 derived in this way have been collected in table 1 .",
    "the uncertainties in the column densities are based on the quality of the fits to the curve of growths .",
    "they range from 0.2 to 0.4 in the logarithm , as shown in fig.4 .",
    "the total column density for the lowest 5 rotational states is @xmath13(h@xmath0)@xmath31 @xmath3 .",
    "to explain the column densities and the relative population of the rotational states of the h@xmath0  molecule we have to determine the mechanism which is responsible for the excitation of the molecular gas on our line of sight .",
    "two processes dominate the population of the excited states , collisional excitation and pumping by uv photons ( spitzer & zweibel 1974 ) . with the column densities for the individual rotational states we were able to determine the excitation temperature for the lmc gas for @xmath32 . in fig.4",
    "the lmc column densities @xmath30 divided by their statistical weight @xmath33 are plotted against the excitation energy @xmath34 .",
    "the equivalent excitation temperature of the gas can be derived by fitting theoretical population densites from a boltzmann distribution .",
    "for @xmath35 we derive an equivalent excitation temperature of 470 k.    the plot of fig.4 shows also that the level @xmath36 lies above the linear relation of 470 k. thus at least the @xmath36 level is populated through kinetic excitation .",
    "fitting the boltzmann relation to the @xmath37 and 1 column densities we find a kinetic temperature of 50 k. clearly , the population of level @xmath37 is due to gas with a temperature @xmath4 k. such very low gas temperatures have also been found by dickey et  al .",

    "( 1998 ) in the lmc through analysis of hi  21 cm absorption .",
    "israel & koornneef ( 1988 ) looked for emission by h@xmath0   in the direction of n11 .",
    "they report a marginal detection of h@xmath0  in the 1 - 0 @xmath38 line at a position very close to our line of sight . however , given the difference in direction as well as the low significance of the emission detection a connection with our absorption will be speculative .",
    "also , the emission may be from gas more distant than the star .",
    "our line of sight through the lmc is ending at the star lh10:3120 .",
    "the association lh10 ionizes the hii  region n11b , the northern hii  clump of the n11 superbubble complex .",
    "the central superbubble is apparently created by the association lh 9 and is filled with hot gas .",
    "several more patches of hot gas , partly coinciding with filamentary h@xmath39 shells , exist .",
    "the one x - ray patch coinciding with n11b hints at wind driven bubbles around some massive stars inside n11b ( mac low et  al .",
    "1998 ) . while n11b indeed shows first signs of the local effects of its most massive stars ( rosado et  al .   1996 ) , it is still a relatively unevoled hii  region without large - scale expansion . our line of sight is therefore most likely illuminated by the stars of lh10 . with the relatively unevolved nature of n11b it is tempting to relate the h@xmath0  absorbing gas with the remainder of the cold molecular cloud which formed n11b .",
    "the total column density found in the lmc can be related to the properties of the h@xmath0  gas in the milky way .",
    "the extinction to lh10:3120  is @xmath12 .",
    "taking out the galactic forground extinction of @xmath40 ( parker et  al .",
    "1992 ) , one has extinction _ in _ the lmc of @xmath41 .",
    "the total h@xmath0  column density in the lmc is , compared to milky way gas ( see fig.4 of savage et  al .   1977 ) , slightly on the low side for its extinction .",
    "the smaller dust to gas content of the lmc ( compared to the milky way ; see koornneef 1984 ) may have influenced the h@xmath0  to @xmath42 ratio by way of a lower h@xmath0  formation rate .",
    "the excitation level of the higher @xmath22 levels on the line of sight to lh10:3120  is equivalent to @xmath6k .",
    "such values are also found for the higher rotational states in galactic gas ( snow 1977 ; spitzer et  al .   1974 ) .",
    "the environment of n11b has contributed to the uv pumping but not in an excessive way .",
    "the excitation of the lowest level indicates the gas is kinetically cold .",
    "our investigation of the _ orfeus _ far uv spectrum shows for the first time well resolved absorption profiles due to h@xmath0   in lmc gas .",
    "the derived column densities and excitation temperatures toward lh 10:3120 demonstrate that uv pumping also takes place in lmc gas .",
    "the detected h@xmath0  has a column density and an excitation state similar to that of milky way gas , even though the line of sight runs through an energetic environment . in closing",
    "we note that h@xmath0  has also been detected in absorption by _",
