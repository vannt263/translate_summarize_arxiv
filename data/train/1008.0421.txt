    "indeed , the formation of these lobes is initiated when the yellow passive tracers encounter the separatrices associated with the hyperbolic points of the relative velocity field   @xmath182 that appear from infinity and move towards the origin along the @xmath127-axis ( see figure  [ fig : newstagnationpoints](b ) ) .",

    "eventually , the passive particles initially placed in the regions around the point vortices , whose detailed evolution is also dictated by the sequence of bifurfactions described in figure  [ fig : separatrix2 ] , join the large lobes as well and begin to stretch and rotate at a finite distance away from the initial vortex configuration , see figure  [ fig : passiveparticles](d)(f ) . after the last bifurcation in figure  [ fig : separatrix2](k ) , all the passive particles continue to rotate as shown in figure  [ fig : passiveparticles](f ) .",
    "we emphasize that this interesting dynamics of the passive particles , which in turn indicates the evolution of the vorticity field , can not be explained based solely on the analysis of the streamlines of the fluid velocity field of section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "in addition , because of the detailed and delicate nature of the full series of topological bifurcations that occur , to capture all but the first of these in a dns would require considerable further effort and is beyond the scope of the current manuscript .",

    "the redistribution ( inviscid ) and diffusion ( viscous ) of delta - function initial distributions of vorticity , although configuration independent for sufficiently _ long _ timescales , is highly dependent on the initial positions and strengths of the point vortices on short and intermediate timescales .",
    "these are typically the timescales in which much of the important mixing , transport , and redistribution of vorticity is achieved in many settings .",
    "greengard s 1985 paper notwithstanding @xcite pointing out that the types of models based on advection and core diffusion are not exact solutions of the navier - stokes equations , these ideas are exceptionally useful in getting a handle on some of the important dynamical mechanisms that occur during the evolution towards the ultimate lamb - oseen state .",
    "in fact , one contribution of the current manuscript is to further quantify and understand the limitations of ` core - growth ' type models as diagnostic tools for understanding more and more complex flows and to point out some of the delicate issues in comparing a dns with these models . not surprisingly , core - growth type models are also useful as starting points for more sophisticated numerical methods which systematically exploit some of the main features @xcite ( also , see _ blobflow _ , an open source vortex method package developed by rossi , available at http://www.math.udel.edu/@xmath205rossi/blobflow as of october 2010 ) .",

    "we show the ` homotopic equivalence ' of each of the distinct patterns in the panels - the time and quantitative values of the pattern are not depicted , just the sequence of distinct patterns that appear during the time sequence ;    \\(iii ) more interestingly , since the velocity field near the origin is of approximate solid - body ( rankine ) form , if we subtract off this field and re - plot the homotopic sequence of patterns that emerges , shown in figure  [ fig : homotopic2 ] , a far richer and more instructive sequence of patterns is revealed , one that is far more relevant for the understanding of the evolution of passive particle transport , as shown clearly in figure  [ fig : passiveparticles ] .",
    "we finish by mentioning connections of this work in two other contexts .",
    "first , there is by now a growing body of work on calculating ` time - dependent separatrices ' in developing flows that goes under the name of ` lagrangian coherent structures ' ( lcs ) @xcite .",
    "certainly these tools are potentially useful for further elucidating the intermediate timescale dynamics associated with the evolution towards the lamb - oseen state , particularly for more complex initial patterns that perhaps start out as relative equilibria of the euler equations .",
    "second , if one regards , the vorticity field as a probability density function associated , for example , with the positions of initial system of point vortices undergoing a random walk , there are meaningful interpretations of the models used in this paper that have been discussed most recently , for example , in @xcite . while this interpretation has not been the main focus of our work , we do find it potentially ripe for future development ."
