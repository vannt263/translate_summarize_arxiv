    "thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are universal and powerful frameworks to describe systems in equilibrium states . in equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the central quantity is the entropy @xmath2 , which describes both the macroscopic properties of equilibrium systems and the fundamental limits on the possible transitions among the equilibrium states .",
    "its operational definition relies on the clausius equality : @xmath3 this equality is valid for quasistatic operations between two equilibrium states . here , @xmath4 is the change in the entropy of the system before and after the operation , @xmath5 is the inverse temperature of the reservoir that is in contact with the system , and @xmath6 is the heat transferred from the reservoir to the system during the operation .",
    "equilibrium statistical mechanics tells that the entropy @xmath2 is given by the shannon entropy of the probability distribution ( von neumann entropy of the density matrix ) of microscopic states in the equilibrium classical ( quantum ) system .",
    "this connects the microscopic physics to the macroscopic one , where we do not need to solve the equation of motion in the microscopic level .",
    "the construction of analogous frameworks of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics for nonequilibrium systems has been one of the central subjects in statistical physics @xcite .",

    "the excess heat @xmath7 is defined by subtracting from @xmath6 the contribution @xmath8 ( called housekeeping heat ) of steady heat dissipation in ness . then it has been shown that in the weakly nonequilibrium regime there exists a scalar potential @xmath9 which satisfies the extended clausius equality , @xmath10 for quasistatic operations .",
    "we refer to @xmath11 as excess entropy production during the operation .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 in eq .",
    "( [ extendedclausius ] ) is given by a symmetrized version of the shannon ( von neumann ) entropy of the ness .",
    "more recently , a formula for the excess entropy production during quasistatic operations in the strongly nonequilibrium regime has been derived in generic classical systems described by the markov jump process @xcite .",
    "this formula is expressed by a geometrical ( berry - phase - like ) quantity @xcite ; i.e. , the excess entropy production is given by a line integral of a vector potential in the operation parameter space .",
    "this implies that , in general , the extended clausius equality does not hold in the strongly nonequilibrium regime .",
    "therefore the operational definition of the nonequilibrium entropy ( scalar thermodynamic potential ) through the excess entropy production is impossible , but the vector potential plays an important role in the thermodynamics for nesss .",
    "since the extended clausius equality holds for both the classical systems @xcite and quantum systems @xcite , it is expected that the geometrical expression for the excess entropy production in the strongly nonequilibrium regime @xcite can also be generalized to quantum systems . in this paper",
    "we show that this expectation is true ; we derive a quantum version of the geometrical expression in open systems described by the quantum markovian master equation ( qmme ) .",
    "this result suggests the universality of the geometrical expression and the importance of the vector potential in the thermodynamics for nesss . it should be noted that in the field of adiabatic pumping the path - dependent physical variables play important roles thanks to the existence of the geometrical phase , where there exists a current between reservoirs without dc bias @xcite .",

    "one can measure ( in principle ) the entropy change in the reservoirs during an operation , which amounts to the entropy transferred from the reservoirs to the system s. this gives the entropy production in the system s during the operation . for quasistatic operations between nesss ,",
    "the total entropy production @xmath25 diverges in time , since there is non - vanishing entropy flux at each time in the nonequilibrium case .",
    "one of the ways of extracting the entropy production intrinsic to the operation is to use the excess entropy production , which is proposed in ref .",
