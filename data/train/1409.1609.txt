    "inventory management is of great economic importance to industry , but forecasting demand for spare parts is difficult because it is _ intermittent _ : in many time periods the demand is zero .",
    "this type of demand occurs in several industries , for example in aerospace and military inventories from which spare parts such as wings or jet engines are infrequently required .",
    "various methods have been proposed for forecasting , some simple and others statistically sophisticated , but relatively little work has been done on intermittent demand .",
    "most work in this area is influenced by that of @xcite , who first separated the forecasting of demand size and inter - demand interval .",
    "a recent review of the literature on intermittent demand can be found in @xcite .",
    "another difficult feature of some inventories is _ obsolescence _ , in which an item has no demand at all after a certain time period .",
    "when many thousands of items are being handled automatically , this may go unnoticed by croston - style methods , which continue to forecast high demand forever though no actual demand has occurred .",
    "the authors of this paper know of an inventory company who were obliged to modify croston s method , artificially forcing its forecasts to zero after a certain number of periods without demand .",
    "this is a pragmatic but inelegant solution , and obsolescence has been neglected in the literature .",
    "however , two recent croston variants have been designed to tackle it : tsb @xcite and he s @xcite .",
    "a qualitative difference between tsb and he s is that when obsolescence occurs tsb s forecasts decay exponentially to zero while those of he s decay hyperbolically .",
    "neither generates forecasts that actually reach zero , though they come arbitrarily close as time proceeds . in this paper",
    "we describe a new croston variant whose forecasts decay linearly to zero in a finite time , a feature we believe will appeal to practitioners .",
    "we compare it empirically and analytically with other forecasters and show that it is unbiased , handles obsolescence better than other methods , and competitive in experiments with intermittent demand .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ background ] surveys existing forecasters and presents the new forecaster , section [ asymp ] analyses the handling of obsolescence by forecasters , section [ experiments ] compares them empirically using synthetic demand data , and section [ conc ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we survey the relevant forecasting methods for handling intermittency and obsolescence , and introduce our new forecaster .",
    "we denote the observed demand at ( discrete ) time @xmath0 by @xmath1 , a smoothed estimate of @xmath2 by @xmath3 , and a forecast by @xmath4 .",
    "_ single exponential smoothing _ ( ses ) generates estimates @xmath3 of the demand by exponentially weighting previous observations using the formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a _",
    "smoothing parameter_. the smaller the value of @xmath7 the less weight is attached to the most recent observations .",
    "there are many variations on ses and they are surveyed in @xcite .",
    "they perform remarkably well , often beating more sophisticated approaches @xcite , but ses is known to perform poorly on _ stochastic intermittent demand_. in a standard model of this type of demand , the occurrence of a nonzero demand is a bernoulli event occurring at each time period with some probability",
    ". the magnitude of the demands may follow any of several distributions .",
    "a well - known method for handling intermittency is _",
    "croston s method _",
    "@xcite which explicitly separates the aspects of demand size and probability of a demand occurring",
    ". it applies ses to the demand size @xmath2 and inter - demand interval @xmath8 independently ( possibly with different smoothing factors ) , where @xmath9 for non - intermittent demand . given",
    "smoothed demand @xmath3 and smoothed interval @xmath10 at time @xmath0 , the forecast is @xmath11 both @xmath3 and @xmath10 are updated at each time @xmath0 for which @xmath12 . according to @xcite it is hard to conclude from the various studies that croston s method is successful , because the results depend on the data used and on how forecast errors are measured .",
    "but it is generally regarded as one of the best methods for intermittent series @xcite , and versions of the method are used in leading statistical forecasting software packages @xcite .",
    "we refer to it as cr .",
    "cr was shown by @xcite to be biased on stochastic intermittent demand , and they corrected the bias by modifying the forecasts : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the smoothing factor used for inter - demand intervals , which may be different to the @xmath7 smoothing factor used for demands . because it is used to smooth both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "] we refer to this variant as sba .",
    "it works well for intermittent demand but is biased for non - intermittent demand , as its forecasts are those of ses multiplied by @xmath17 .",
    "this problem is avoided by @xcite who uses a forecast @xmath18 this removes the bias on non - intermittent demand but increases the forecast variance @xcite .",
    "we refer to this variant as sy .",
    "another modified croston method is described by @xcite , who apply ses to the ratio of demand size and inter - demand period when a nonzero demand occurs : @xmath19 however , this turns out to be biased on stochastic intermittent demand @xcite .",
    "though these variants successfully handle intermittency , they do not handle obsolescence well : when obsolescence occurs they continue forever to forecast a fixed nonzero demand .",
    "the first croston variant explicitly designed to handle obsolescence is the tsb method of @xcite which updates an estimate of the _ demand probability _ instead of the inter - demand interval :",
    "instead of a smoothed interval @xmath10 it uses a smoothed probability estimate @xmath20 where @xmath21 is 1 when demand occurs at time @xmath0 and 0 otherwise .",
    "different smoothing factors @xmath7 and @xmath14 are used for @xmath3 and @xmath20 respectively .",
    "@xmath20 is updated every period while @xmath3 is only updated when demand occurs .",
    "the forecast is @xmath22 this method is unbiased and handles intermittency well .",
    "it also solves the problem of obsolescence because , like ses but unlike other croston variants , when an item becomes obsolescent its forecasts decay exponentially to zero .",
    "another croston variant designed to handle obsolescence is the hyperbolic - exponential smoothing ( he s ) method of @xcite . like most croston variants he s separates demands into demand size @xmath1 and inter - demand interval @xmath23 .",
    "its forecasts are @xmath24 between nonzero demands @xmath8 increases linearly , producing a hyperbolic decay in the forecasts .",
    "this was justified in @xcite by a bayesian argument .",
    "our new croston variant is similar in form to he s but uses forecasts @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes @xmath27 .",
    "when obsolescence occurs the forecasts decay linearly to zero at a rate controlled by @xmath14 , and when they reach zero they remain there until further nonzero demands occur",
    ". the rate at which they decay can be controlled by adjusting @xmath14 .",
    "this feature distinguishes it from all other croston variants , which only approach zero asymptotically .",
    "we call this forecaster linear - exponential smoothing ( les ) .",
    "we show in appendix [ lesder ] that les is theoretically unbiased on stochastic intermittent demand , under the assumption that @xmath28 .",
    "if this assumption does not hold ( which may occur if we set @xmath14 to a high value ) then the term will be replaced by 0 , causing a positive bias , but we show empirically in section [ stationary ] that this effect is negligible .",
    "pseudocode for les is shown in figure [ lescode ] and a graph illustrating its behaviour is shown in figure [ pluseffect ] .",
    "at the left of the graph demand is stochastic intermittent ( shown as impulses ) with probability 0.25 and fixed size , but then sudden obsolescence occurs as the probability drops instantaneously to 0 .",
    "all forecasters use @xmath29 , except that tsb uses @xmath30 because @xcite recommend a smaller value .",
    "the graph shows that all four forecasters behave reasonably on stationary demand , but that when obsolescence occurs sba ( like most croston variants ) continues indefinitely with a nonzero forecast while tsb , he s and les decay in different ways .",
    "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa=@xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 + at each time period + @xmath34 current demand + if @xmath35 + @xmath36 + @xmath37 + @xmath38 + @xmath32 + else + @xmath39 + @xmath40",
    "there are now three croston variants that are explicitly designed to handle obsolescence : tsb , he s and les .",
    "they have qualitatively different behaviour when obsolescence occurs , respectively decaying exponentially , hyperbolically and linearly .",
    "each is approximately unbiased on stochastic intermittent demand , but which best handles obsolescence ?    this is a difficult question because the answer clearly depends on many factors : the type of demand data , how long we compare forecasters before and after obsolescence occurs , and which error measures we use for the comparison . in section [ experiments ]",
    "we shall perform experiments , but in this section we analyse the asymptotic behaviour of the different forecasters , in an attempt to obtain a definitive answer",
    ".    we shall compute error measures for the forecasters , using times starting from just after obsolescence occurs at time 0 , up to some large @xmath41 .",
    "we assume the demand to be highly intermittent , that is @xmath23 is typically large , so the user will choose small @xmath14 .",
    "this represents a worst - case scenario in which an automated inventory control system continues to make forecasts far from zero for an obsolete item for a long time , because it believes demand to be highly intermittent based on previous data .",
    "we shall analyse how the forecasters perform under this scenario .",
    "we ignore the machine - dependent issue of arithmetic errors causing truncation to 0 as forecasts become small .",
    "all the forecasters are unbiased so we assume they have the same forecast @xmath42 when obsolescence occurs at time 0 .",
    "a surprising variety of measures have been used in the literature and in forecasting competitions @xcite .",
    "there is no consensus on which is best so it is generally recommended to use several .",
    "we shall consider all measures listed in the surveys of @xcite and the article @xcite .",
    "the _ scale - dependent measures _ are based on the mean error @xmath43 or mean square error @xmath44 , and include mean error , mean square error , root mean square error , mean absolute error and median absolute error .",
    "as @xmath41 all these tend to zero so they can not be used for an asymptotic comparison .",
    "the _ percentage errors _ are based on the quantities @xmath45 and include mean absolute percentage error , median absolute percentage error , root mean square percentage error , root median square percentage error , symmetric mean absolute percentage error , and symmetric median absolute percentage error .",
    "as @xmath46 for all @xmath47 these are undefined for almost all times .",
    "the _ relative error - based measures _ are based on the quantities @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the error from a baseline forecaster , and include mean relative absolute error , median relative absolute error , and geometric mean relative absolute error .",
    "the baseline forecaster is usually the _ random walk _ ( or _ naive method _ ) which simply forecasts that the next demand will be identical to the current demand . for almost all times @xmath50 so these measures are undefined .",
    "we could use another baseline but we would still have the problem that the mean and median @xmath51 are zero , so these can not be used for a comparison .",
    "the _ relative measures _ are mainly defined as the ratio of ( i ) an error measure , and ( ii ) the same measure applied to a baseline forecaster .",
    "these include relative mean absolute error , relative mean squared error , and relative root mean squared error ( for example the u2 statistic ) .",
    "the baseline forecaster is again usually the random walk .",
    "both measures tend to zero as @xmath41 so these can not be used for our comparison . a different form of relative measure is percent better , which computes the percentage of times a forecaster has smaller absolute error @xmath52 than a baseline forecaster ,",
    "again usually random walk .",
    "random walk has asymptotically perfect performance so percent better can not be used for our comparison .",
    "a related measure is percent best in which no baseline forecaster is used : instead it computes the percentage of times each forecaster being tested has smaller absolute error than the others .",
    "we shall use this measure below .",
    "the _ scaled errors _ include mad / mean ratio @xcite and mean absolute scaled error @xcite .",
    "the former can not be used for our comparison because the denominator ( the mean error ) tends to zero , while the latter can not be used because it is proportional to @xmath51 which tends to zero .",
    "there are also three recent measures designed for intermittent demand @xcite .",
    "( i ) cumulative forecast error is defined as the sum of all errors over the time periods under consideration .",
    "not taking averages means that errors do not become vanishingly small , so this measure gives meaningful results .",
    "we shall use it and also the related cumulative squared error ( which was not mentioned in @xcite ) : a motivation for using squared errors is that they penalise outliers more severely than absolute errors , giving a different perspective .",
    "( ii ) number of shortages at time @xmath0 is defined as the number of periods in which the cumulative forecast error is strictly positive and demand is nonzero . in our scenario demand is always zero after obsolescence occurs so this is not meaningful .",
    "( iii ) periods in stock at time @xmath0 is defined as @xmath53 in our scenario @xmath54 for all @xmath55 so this reduces to @xmath56 but as @xmath57 the term @xmath58 and all other terms are positive , so this measure is also not meaningful here .",
    "thus percent best ( pbt ) , cumulative forecast error ( cfe ) and cumulative squared error ( cse ) are the only error measures we know of that can be used for our comparison .",
    "the results of the comparison are shown in table [ asympres ] and the derivations are given in appendix [ errdev ] .",
    "first we consider the cfe results .",
    "he s is worst with infinite error .",
    "tsb appears to beat les but only if they use the same smoothing factor @xmath14 , and it is recommended by @xcite to use a smaller @xmath14 for tsb . in the absence of an exact known relationship between @xmath14 and @xmath10 ( we know only that they are inversely related in some sense ) the two results are incomparable , so neither tsb nor les can be shown to dominate the other .",
    "next we consider the cse results .",
    "tsb is incomparable with he s and les , but les is 3 times better than he s .",
    "finally , we consider the pbt results . here les beats both he s and tsb ."
