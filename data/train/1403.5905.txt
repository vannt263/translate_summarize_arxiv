    "in recent years , feedback control of transport in small nonequilibrium systems such as `` stairclimbing '' colloids @xcite and fluctuating photon states in quantum - optical systems @xcite has become a topic of active research @xcite . by definition , ``",
    "feedback '' ( or closed - loop ) control means that the system evolves dynamically under a protocol which depends on an internal variable containing information about the system @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that feedback control can lead to pronounced changes of the dynamics compared to purely external ( `` open - loop '' ) control and can , in some cases , strongly improve transport properties such as effective currents .",
    "a prime example from the classical side are ratchet systems ( or brownian motors ) @xcite , specifically the so - called flashing ratchets that operate by switching on and off a spatially periodic asymmetric potential : here it has been shown , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite , that the fluctuation - induced directed transport can be strongly enhanced by switching not under an externally defined protocol , but  on demand \" .",
    "besides the dynamics itself , another topic of intense research is the impact of feedback control on non - equilibrium _ thermodynamics _ @xcite , concerning particularly the entropy production and fluctuation theorems in both , classical @xcite and quantum systems @xcite . for example , for a classical ratchet model it has been shown that the energy input ( work ) is smaller with closed- than with open - loop control @xcite . exploring these ideas",
    "is fostered by recent advancements of experimental techniques for single - particle manipulation and electronic transport , which is of major relevance in various areas such as microfluidics @xcite , biomedical engineering @xcite , and quantum optics @xcite .    whereas many earlier studies of feedback - controlled systems focused on _ instantaneous _ feedback ( i.e. , no time lag between measurement and control action ) @xcite , there is increasing interest in exploring systems with time delay @xcite . the latter typically arises from a time lag between the detection of a signal and the control action , an essentially omnipresent situation in experimental setups .",
    "traditionally , time delay was often considered as a perturbation ; for example , in some ratchet systems it reduces the efficiency of transport @xcite",
    ". however , time delay can also have significant positive effects .",
    "for example , it can stabilize desired stationary states in sheared liquid crystals @xcite , it can optimize electron transport in quantum - dot nanostructures @xcite , and it can generate new effects such as current reversal @xcite and spatiotemporal oscillations in extended systems @xcite . moreover , time delay can have a _ stabilizing _ effect on chaotic orbits , a prime example being pyragas control scheme @xcite of time - delayed feedback control @xcite .    in this spirit , we discuss in the present paper a classical transport system with feedback , where it is the time delay , which _ generates _ current . specifically",
    ", we consider a so - called rocking ratchet where an overdamped colloidal particle is subject to a combination of a static , asymmetric potential and a time - dependent driving force @xcite .",
    "this contrasts flashing ratchets , where there is only one type of potential , that is , the asymmetric potential which is switched on either periodically ( open - loop control ) or measurement - dependent ( closed - loop control ) . in a previous study , feito _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have considered a feedback - controlled flashing ratchet with additional periodic drive .",
    "our feedback system is somewhat closer to the original rocking ratchet model where the total conservative force is the sum of a purely space - dependent and a purely time - dependent force , the latter being typically an oscillation with an externally fixed frequency .",
    "contrary to that , the feedback force introduced in sec .",
    "[ model ] of this paper depends on the mean particle position , i.e. , an internal variable of the system , relative to some reference position in the system .",
    "moreover , we choose the mean particle position at an _ earlier _ time @xmath6 as the control target .",
    "we show that , due to the time delay @xmath7 , the feedback force develops an oscillatory behavior which eventually leads to a non - zero net current .",
    "we also demonstrate that , for appropriate values of the reference position , transport is even _",
    "improved _ as compared to that in a corresponding open - loop device .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the entropy production in our system .",
    "indeed , the interplay of ( non - equilibrium ) thermodynamics @xcite and feedback control is a topic attracting strong interest @xcite , recently also for systems with time delay @xcite .",
    "our study is based on a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) @xcite where the delayed force enters _",
    "ad hoc_. we note that , in presence of time delay , the connection between the fpe and the underlying langevin equation is not straightforward ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "still , since we consider the mean particle position as control target , the results become consistent with those from a corresponding langevin equation ( with delayed force ) , if the number of noise realizations goes to infinity . in the appendix of the paper",
    "we demonstrate this consistency numerically and present a justification .",
    "we consider the motion of an overdamped colloidal particle at temperature @xmath8 in a one - dimensional , periodic potential @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the particle s position .",
    "in addition to thermal fluctuations , the particle experiences a time - dependent force @xmath11 . the dynamics is investigated via the fpe @xcite for the probability density @xmath12          \\nonumber      \\\\      & = & -\\partial_z g(z , t),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the short - time diffusion coefficient , satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the boltzmann and the friction constant , respectively ) , and @xmath17 is the probability current .    in the present paper we model @xmath9 by a periodic , piecewise linear ,  sawtooth \" potential @xcite defined by @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the potential height , @xmath21 is the period , and @xmath22 @xmath23 $ ] is the asymmetry parameter .",
    "here we choose @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the diameter of the colloid , and @xmath26 .",
    "the potential minimum is at @xmath27 .",

    "the central interval is defined by @xmath28 . ]    in the absence of any further force beyond that arising from @xmath9 , the system approaches for @xmath29 an equilibrium state and thus there is no transport ( i.e. , no net particle current ) .",
    "it is well established , however , that by supplementing @xmath9 by a time - dependent oscillatory force ( yielding a  rocking ratchet \" ) , the system is permanently out of equilibrium and macroscopic transport can be achieved @xcite .",
    "this occurs even when the time - average of the oscillatory force is zero , a characteristic feature of a true thermal ratchet .    here",
    "we propose an alternative driving force , where the time dependency arises only through the _ internal state _ of the system .",
    "thus , the force applies feedback control onto the system . as a ",
    "control target \" we consider the mean particle position within the central interval @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the probability density calculated with periodic boundary conditions , that is , @xmath33 .",
    "our reasoning behind choosing the _ mean _ rather than the true position as control target is twofold : first , within the fpe treatment we have no access to the particle s position for a given realization of noise , because the latter has already been averaged out .",
    "this is in contrast to previous studies using langevin equations @xcite where the dynamical variable is the particle position itself .",
    "second , the mean position is an experimentally accessible quantity , which can be monitored , e.g. , by video microscopy @xcite .",
    "our ansatz for the force reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the amplitude ( chosen to be positive ) , @xmath36 is a fixed position within the range @xmath37 $ ] ( where @xmath38 increases with @xmath10 ) , and the sign function is defined by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) for @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . from eq .",
    "( [ f_fc ] ) on sees that the feedback force changes its sign whenever the delayed mean particle position @xmath43 becomes smaller or larger than @xmath36 ; we therefore call @xmath36 the  switching \" position",
    ".    our ansatz is partially motivated by an earlier ( langevin equation based ) study of craig _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on feedback control of a flashing ratchet via the so - called  maximum - displacement strategy \" . in that study ,",
    "the fixed position @xmath36 was identified with the mean particle position of the _ uncontrolled system _ [ i.e. , @xmath44 $ ] at @xmath29 , that is , the equilibrium position @xmath45 , where @xmath46 $ ] . here",
    "we rather regard @xmath36 as a free parameter .",
    "another main feature of our driving mechanism ( not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is the presence of a time delay , @xmath7 . as discussed in several studies",
    "( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , time delay is a rather natural phenomenon which may arise , e.g. , through the finite time required for measuring or processing information from a measurement .",
    "in the present case , as we will demonstrate below , the time delay is indeed _ crucial _ for generating particle transport .",
    "to better understand the impact of the force  ( [ f_fc ] ) , let us briefly consider the case @xmath47 . for simplicity , we set @xmath48 . in fig .",

    "a ) in the absence of time delay ( @xmath47 ) , b ) with time delay .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the switching position ( set to @xmath49 ) , as well as @xmath50 [ and @xmath43 in b ) ] . ]    in this case @xmath51 , meaning that the force tends to push the particle towards @xmath36 . in analogous manner",
    "we find that @xmath52 if the particle is left from @xmath36 .",
    "as time is progressing the mean particle position thus becomes  trapped \" at @xmath36 .",
    "clearly , this excludes any net transport .",
    "however , transport can be generated in the presence of a non - zero time delay , @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ schematic]b ) shows as an example a situation where the mean particle position at time @xmath1 is at the right side of @xmath36 , while it has been on the left side at time @xmath6 .",
    "in this situation the force @xmath5 points _ away _ from @xmath36 ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , contrary to the case @xmath47 considered in fig .",
    "[ schematic]a ) .",
    "thus , the particle experiences a driving force towards the next potential valley , which changes only when the delayed position becomes larger than @xmath36 .",
    "the force then points to the left until the delayed position crosses @xmath36 again .",
    "this oscillation of the force ( see also sec .",
    "[ target ] ) , together with the asymmetry of @xmath9 , creates a ratchet effect .",
    "we note that the feedback - controlled ratchet introduced here strongly differs from previous models of such systems .",
    "in particular , feito _",
    "_ @xcite have considered a rocking ratchet composed of a static potential similar to ours plus an oscillatory drive .",
    "feedback - control ( based on the average particle force ) is then introduced as a prefactor in front of the static potential ; i.e. , the latter is switched on only if the force satisfies certain requirements . in the present model , the control force acts in addition to the static potential , and there is no additional oscillating force .",
    "another , somewhat subtle aspect of the present model is that we introduce feedback on the level of the fokker - planck equation describing the evolution of the probability density .",
    "this is different from earlier studies based on the langevin equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where the feedback is applied directly to the position of one particle , @xmath55 , or to the average of @xmath56 particle positions @xmath57 .",
    "introducing feedback control in such systems implies to introduce effective _ interactions _ between the particles . as a consequence ,",
    "the transport properties in these particle - based models depend explicitly on the number of particles , @xmath56 .",
    "typically it turns out that the current becomes small or even vanishes when the particle number increases , the reason being that fluctuations ( which are essential for the ratchet effect ) disappear @xcite . from the perspective of these langevin - based models",
    ", the present model corresponds to the `` mean - field '' limit @xmath58 .",
    "this connection to a langevin model is further discussed in the appendix . given that we are in the `` mean - field '' limit , it is even more interesting that we do observe a non - vanishing current which can be even larger than in an open - loop system @xcite .",
    "this is because our model involves a time delay .",
    "in this section we present numerical results for the feedback - controlled transport based on numerical solution of the fpe eq .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) .",
    "the height of the static potential is set to @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , similar values are found in experiments of colloids in structured light fields @xcite .",
    "time is measured in units of the brownian timescale , @xmath60 , which is of the order of @xmath61 to @xmath62 for typical colloids @xcite . in all calculations ,",
    "the initial condition for the probability density is a @xmath63-function localized at the minimum of @xmath9 , @xmath64 .",
    "further , to initialize the control force , we set @xmath65 for @xmath66 .",
    "the data presented in the following correspond to time ranges after an initial ( yet very short )  equilibration \" period , after which the dynamic quantities considered display a regular dynamical behavior .",
    "we start by considering the time evolution of the mean particle position , @xmath50 , which determines the control force .",
    "exemplary data for two amplitudes @xmath67 are shown in fig .",

    "]    however , the precise value of the period as well as the shape of the oscillations depend on the values of @xmath75 and @xmath36 ( see also sec .  [ current ] ) .    due to the oscillatory behavior of @xmath50 , the delayed position @xmath43 oscillates around @xmath36 as well .",
    "it follows from our definition of the feedback force [ see eq .",

    "when the same happens to the delayed position @xmath89 , the cycle starts again .",
    "we remark that in order to see _ persistent _ oscillations of the control target and thus , the control force , it is crucial that the function contained in @xmath2 is very sensitive to even tiny differences between @xmath43 and @xmath36 .",
    "indeed , besides the sign - function we have also tested continuous functions such as @xmath92 [ or @xmath93 , which tend to zero when @xmath94 [ or @xmath95 . in these cases ,",

    "contrary to @xmath50 , the travelled distance @xmath96 takes into account that the particle actually moves from one potential valley to the next .    to this end",

    ", we are interested in the _ total entropy production _ , which measures how far the system is away from equilibrium , and in the _ work _ that is performed on the particle .",
    "we calculate these quantities on the basis of stochastic thermodynamics . for systems with",
    "_ instantaneous _",
    "feedback control this is a well - established field @xcite .",
    "this is generally not the case for systems with time delay , in which the underlying ( langevin or master ) equations of motion become _ non - markovian _ such that concepts of standard stochastic thermodynamics ( which assumes markovian dynamics ) are not immediately applicable @xcite .    in the present case",
    "the situation is somewhat easier because we are working in a mean - field limit .",
    "as discussed in the appendix , this limit allows us to establish a connection between our fpe and an underlying langevin equation ; it also allows us to consider our delayed feedback control force just as a special type of time - dependent force . in the following we stress this argument further and use various fpe - based standard formula for thermodynamic quantities . to test the fpe results we compare with those obtained from trajectory - based expressions via brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulations .",
    "we start by considering the _ averaged _ total entropy production , @xmath134 . within stochastic thermodynamics , the total entropy @xmath135 , for a single trajectory @xmath136 ,",
    "consists of two contributions @xcite , i.e. , @xmath137 . here",
    ", @xmath138 is the trajectory - dependent entropy of the `` system '' ( i.e. , the particle ) , and @xmath139/\\mathcal{t}$ ] is the medium entropy related to the heat @xmath140 $ ] dissipated into the medium .",
    "upon averaging over the ensemble of trajectories @xcite , one finds the following compact expression for the time - derivative ( production rate ) of the total entropy @xmath141 where @xmath17 is the probability current [ see eq .",
    "( [ fpe ] ) ] .",
    "numerical results for @xmath142 are shown in fig .",
    "[ entropy_production ] where we focus on a situation where the net current in our closed - loop scheme is larger than in the open - loop system .    , @xmath143 , and @xmath72 , and for the corresponding open - loop - controlled ratchet with @xmath120 and @xmath144 .",
    "included are results based on bd simulations of the langevin equation ( see appendix ) . ]    included are results for the corresponding open - loop system ( in which @xmath145 ) .",
    "for both the closed - loop and the open - loop system , @xmath146 displays periodic behavior with similar features .",
    "first , the beginning of a new cycle is indicated by a very large and narrow peak .",
    "after the peak @xmath146 decreases to a small , yet non - zero value and then rises towards a second , broader maximum , followed by a further sharp peak .",
    "the latter is related to the change of the feedback force from positive to negative values .",
    "for the open - loop system this happens exactly in the middle of the cycle [ see eq .  ] . in the closed - loop system",
    ", the change is somewhat shifted .",
    "this deviation is indeed the main difference between the closed - loop- and the open - loop - controlled system .",
    "we have also calculated the total entropy production by bd simulations based on eq .",
    "( [ langevin ] ) . on that level ,",
    "the rate of change of the system entropy is given as @xmath147 , with @xmath148 being a noise average .",
    "in practice , we have evaluated @xmath149 using the relation @xmath150 where the probability density is calculated as @xmath151 .",
    "further , the medium entropy is calculated from @xcite @xmath152 to evaluate this expression we have used the stratonovich interpretation .",
    "it is seen that the bd data ( which have been obtained with @xmath153 ) are fully consistent with those from the fpe approach .    to calculate the work performed on the particle we note that , contrary to the dissipated heat , the work involves only changes of the total systematic force at fixed particle position @xcite which is , in our case , @xmath154 . on the level of a single trajectory",
    "@xmath136 the work therefore reads @xmath155=\\int_0^{t}\\!\\mathrm{d}t'\\,f_\\mathrm{fc}(t')\\,\\dot{\\chi}(t ' )          \\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] to achieve a description in terms of the fpe we make use of the formula @xmath156 @xcite ( implicitly assuming again that the time delayed feedback control force enters the fpe just like a special time - dependent force ) . the noise - averaged work is then given by @xmath157 in fig .",
    "[ work ] we compare the time - dependence of the work for the closed - loop system with two different switching positions with the corresponding open - loop system .    , @xmath143 , and two switching positions @xmath36 .",
    "included are results for the corresponding system under open - loop control . ]",
    "it is seen that the work increases in each cycle , with the strongest ascent taking place in those portions of the cycle where the force is positive .",
    "furthermore , comparing the two systems with feedback control , we find that the amount of work needed to transport the particle is larger for the system with @xmath72 , than for the one at @xmath49 .",
    "we recall that the net current is larger at @xmath72 , too ( see fig .",
    "[ j_period ] ) .",
    "figure  [ work ] also shows that the work pertaining to the system under open - loop control has qualitatively a similar time dependence , with the numerical values being in between those of the two feedback - control ratchets .",
    "in other words , in our system feedback control does not necessarily imply that the energy input is smaller than that in a comparable open - loop device .",
    "in this paper we have presented a novel type of a rocking ratchet system , where the particle is subject to a space - dependent , asymmetric potential and a time - dependent , homogeneous feedback control force .",
    "the control target is the time - delayed mean particle position relative to a switching position , @xmath36 .",
    "the dynamical properties are mainly studied with a fokker - planck equation , where the time - delayed feedback force is introduced _",
    "ad hoc_. in addition , we have established a connection to a corresponding langevin equation with mean - field coupling .    to explore the transport properties of our system",
    "we have investigated the net current in dependence of the parameters of the control force , that is , delay time , amplitude and switching position .",
    "our results clearly show that the time delay involved in the feedback protocol is _ essential _ for the creation of a ratchet effect and , thus , for a nonzero net current .",
    "a further important ingredient is the discontinuous dependence of the feedback force on the control target .",
    "an important question for every feedback - controlled system is its efficiency relative to a comparable system under open - loop control .",
    "we have found , indeed , that for a certain range of switching positions ( and not too large delay times ) , the net current is _ enhanced _ relative to the open - loop system . at the same time , however , the work performed on the particle is larger in the feedback - controlled system .",
    "this finding is somehow in contrast to a recent result for another ratchet system @xcite where , at the same time , the current was enhanced and the work was _ reduced _ by feedback control . given these subtleties , it seems worth to investigate in more detail the thermodynamic properties of our model system , including fluctuation theorems and the jarzynski relation @xcite .",
    "another interesting question is to which extent the present feedback scheme , which relies on the ( time - delayed ) mean particle position as a control target , could be improved to realize , e.g. , a larger net current .",
    "in fact , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ j_delay ] , the current @xmath111 does not exceed its value pertaining to the adiabatic limit , at least not for the range of switching positions considered here ( recall that this range has been chosen such that the time - averaged force is close to zero ) .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to see whether larger values of @xmath111 are achievable by choosing another control target ( involving , e.g. , the force rather than the mean position ) or by an otherwise modified control protocol .",
    "so far , there exists no direct experimental realization of the system proposed here , but the main ingredients are already well established . indeed , ratchet potentials acting on colloids can be easily realized by using laser beams @xcite ( optical line trap ) , and the position of a colloidal particle ( or the mean position of many particles ) is accessible , e.g. , by video microscopy .",
    "moreover , feedback control based on the particle position ( or mean position ) has already been realized experimentally , e.g. in the context of a feedback - controlled _ flashing _",
    "ratchet @xcite and a maxwell demon @xcite .",
    "another ingredient , which is indeed crucial in our system , is the presence of a time delay .",
    "experimentally , delay arises from various factors @xcite , including the time for numerical determination of particle positions via the camera and the time for the decision whether to switch the force . in experiments this delay time is about @xmath158ms @xcite for systems with very few particles and about @xmath159ms for a large system containing many particles ( @xmath160 ) , where larger images are required . to judge the impact on transport properties such as @xmath111",
    ", these experimental data for @xmath4 have to be compared with the intrinsic ( `` brownian '' ) time scale @xmath60 of a colloidal system .",
    "the latter time is about @xmath161 ( for particle sizes of @xmath162 and diffusion constants @xmath163m@xmath164/s for colloids in an aqueous solution @xcite ) ; therefore , one typically has @xmath165 .",
    "according to the results presented in fig .",
    "[ j_delay ] , this is just the regime of ratios @xmath166 , where the current strongly deviates from the adiabatic limit and , in particular , can be larger than in the open - loop protocol .",
    "therefore , we hope that our study will stimulate not only further theoretical work , but also experiments .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through sfb 910 ( project b2 ) .",
    "included are fpe results . ]    in this appendix we discuss the connection of the fpe  ( [ fpe ] ) and the langevin equation @xmath167 where @xmath168 is given by eq .

    "then , eq .  ( [ langevin ] ) has the form discussed in earlier studies on delayed langevin equations , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . for such systems ,",
    "the problem in going from the langevin equation to the fpe is that the feedback control force depends on the _ full _ microscopic ( stochastic ) trajectory of the particle in phase space up to time t. therefore , the resulting fpe involves the conditional probability that the particle was at position @xmath177 at time @xmath3 _ given _ that it is at position @xmath10 at time @xmath1 .",
    "an fpe which is formally similar to the usual one [ involving only @xmath32 ] can then be obtained by introducing a `` delay - averaged force '' , that is , the integral over space of @xmath179 times the conditional probability @xcite .",
    "now we consider the `` mean - field '' limit @xmath58 . for each time @xmath1 ,",
    "averaging over an infinite number of particles is equivalent to averaging over the infinite number of realizations of the stochastic force .",
    "therefore , the quantity @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ m_def ] ) becomes identical to the ensemble - averaged particle position , i.e. , @xmath180 . as a consequence ,",
    "the force @xmath181 does not depend any more on a stochastic quantity , in other words , the information about the individual stochastic trajectories at time @xmath182 is no longer required . in the `` mean - field '' limit",

    "( [ langevin ] ) , that is , @xmath183    from eq .",
    "( [ langevininf ] ) , we can derive the fpe in the standard way , i.e. , by using the kramers - moyal ( km ) expansion @xcite .",
    "the calculations are , in principle , straightforward ; in particular , there is no problem with multiplicative noise in the mean - field limit .",
    "the only uncommon issue arises through the fact that our feedback force changes its sign _ abruptly _ when @xmath43 crosses @xmath36 .",
    "we thus consider in more detail the first (  drift \" ) km coefficient @xmath184 the expression in brackets is evaluated through @xmath185 which can be treated by inserting eq .   for @xmath186 into eq .",
    ", iteratively ( see @xcite ) . due to the limit @xmath187 and the noise average incorporated in @xmath188 [ see eq .",
    "( [ kmcoeff ] ) ] all terms @xmath189 as well as terms involving @xmath190 vanish .",
    "the remaining task is to evaluate the term @xmath191 the problem with eq .",
    "( [ coeff_ffc ] ) is that , if @xmath192 changes its sign in the interval @xmath193 $ ] , the limit @xmath187 of @xmath194 does not exist .",
