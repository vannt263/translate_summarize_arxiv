    "motor proteins ( kinesins , dyneins and myosins ) are versatile biomolecules which shuttle cargo encapsulated in vesicles to different parts of the cell . such transport occurs _ via _ the cytoskeleton , a cell - spanning polymeric network of microtubules , actin filaments and intermediate filaments .",
    "motor proteins are also important ingredients of the mechanisms of muscle contraction and cell division .",
    "the quest for physical principles that enable such tiny molecular machines to function efficiently in a highly brownian regime is a subject of ongoing interest.@xcite + molecular motors are typically dimeric@xcite .",
    "conventional kinesins , for example , consist of two identical proteins , each of which has a motor domain ( the head ) and a cargo binding domain .",
    "a stalk intervenes between the head and the cargo binding domain . the two stalks coil around each other to produce the dimer .",
    "the two heads walk unidirectionally along a micro - tubule , a long and fairly stiff polymer comprised of an asymmetric repeating unit , in 8 nm steps .",
    "each such step is coupled to the hydrolysis of a molecule of atp .",
    "typically , such kinesins can walk several hundred steps before detaching from the micro - tubule track .",
    "+ simple models for molecular motors idealize them as brownian motors@xcite . a brownian",
    "motor is a point particle with an overdamped equation of motion , which exhibits directed motion when subject to thermal and athermal noise@xcite .",
    "the thermal noise is assumed to be gaussian and satisfies a fluctuation - dissipation relation . for molecular motors ,",
    "the athermal noise reflects the non - equilibrium driving of the motor through the irreversible hydrolysis of atp .",
    "+ the interaction of the motor with the molecular track is modeled in terms of an asymmetric periodic potential felt by the motor@xcite .",
    "this potential switches between two or more states .",
    "the energy release upon atp hydrolysis is believed to alter the coupling of the motor protein to the substrate .",
    "it is thus modeled by a switch in the potential state seen by the brownian particle .",
    "+ the fact that the motor molecule is a two - headed object is ignored in these simple models ( however , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . experimentally ,",
    "two structural elements of the junction of the two heads appear to be crucial to rapid motility  the neck and the neck linker .",
    "the neck linker lies just beyond the catalytic core of the head , while the neck leads from the neck linker to the coiled stalk .",
    "the coupling of the two heads _ via _ the neck region ensures that an elastic interaction operates between the heads . the enhanced processivity and rate of movement in _",
    "_ conventional kinesins has been attributed , in part , to the enhanced flexibility of its neck region@xcite .",
    "+ models of motor activity also indicate that the binding of one head as a consequence of atp hydrolysis correlates closely with the loosening of the other head upon the subsequent release of the inorganic phosphate@xcite .",
    "this suggests that a more physically realistic brownian motor model of the working of a two - headed molecular motor would involve ( a ) the incorporation of an elastic interaction between motor heads and ( b ) switching between potential states which are fully anti - correlated between heads , so that one head is loosely bound when the other is tightly bound and _ vice versa_. + to develop these ideas further , we propose and study a simple model of a two - headed molecular motor interacting with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath0 .",
    "our model system consists of two elastically coupled overdamped brownian particles moving in periodic potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these potentials alternate in time ; we will assume this switching to be time periodic with period @xmath3 .",
    "we take @xmath4 to be a periodic asymmetric potential and @xmath5 to be a flat potential .",
    "the potentials felt by the two particles are out of phase _",
    "i.e. _ when one of them moves under the influence of potential @xmath4 , the other only sees the force due to the elastic linkage with the other particle . + our model has some similarities , and yet some important differences , with others proposed earlier . unlike the models proposed by klumpp _ et .",
    "al._@xcite , and by ajdari@xcite , our model has no multiplicative _ noise _ terms , although the time - periodic variation of the potential does enter multiplicatively in our equations of motion .",
    "also , in our model , the potentials  @xmath6 or @xmath7   felt by one head are ( anti-)correlated with the potentials felt by the other , not uncorrelated as in earlier work .",
    "+ we have studied our model numerically _ via _ langevin simulations in the weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "our model exhibits a range of unusual behaviour , including an enhanced current due to coupling in some parameter range ( this has been noted earlier in a different but related model @xcite ) , drift in the deterministic regime ( with phase - locked behaviour @xcite ) , and noise induced stability @xcite .",

    "+ the current here arises as a consequence of both the `` flashing ratchet mechanism '' and the cooperative `` pulling effect '' . for low coupling ,",
    "the contribution of coupling at a temperature at which the current arising out of the `` flashing '' mechanism is maximum , is negligible .",
    "hence the net current peaks at a lower value of @xmath0 compared to the @xmath63 case . for higher",
    "@xmath11 , where the current due to coupling dominates , a different scenario obtains .",

    ". the larger the @xmath11 , the stronger the amplitude of the fluctuation required . if , however , the temperature is too high , significant motion is induced in the opposite direction and the current reaches a maximum .",

    "this can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ t5_a.2 ] and the inset .",

    "+ in the nonadiabatic regime obtained for low values of @xmath3 , even for extremely small values of @xmath11 , currents may either enhance _ or _ decrease relative to the single particle current .",
    "this differs from our earlier observation in the adiabatic limit where an enhanced current is obtained for arbitrary small values of @xmath11 , for any @xmath51 .",
    "these results will be reported elsewhere .",
    "our simple model of a two - headed motor comprised of two coupled brownian particles in a flashing potential , exhibits unidirectional current .",
    "the coupling between particles induces an additional mechanism by which a current may be obtained ( _ via _ a pulling effect ) , which is absent in the single particle case@xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the current depends sensitively on system parameters and exhibits several novel features , such as an enhanced current due to coupling compared to the single particle case , in a regime which we identify .",
    "outside this regime , coupling may or may not lead to a current enhancement .",
    "+ as a function of noise strength , the current can exhibit noise induced stability in a restricted parameter range . outside this range",
    ", noise initially enhances current and the absolute value of current shows a single maxima . in the deterministic case , we have shown the existence of a window for the two particle separation distance within which there is a deterministic current .",
    "this current shows a phase locked behaviour with coupling constant . unlike previous studies on related models ,",
    "we have not observed current reversals as a function of system parameters .",
    "+ what relevance , if any , might these results have to real motors ?",
    "while generically , weakening the coupling of the two heads ( particles ) appears to _ reduce _ the current , we do see specific regimes in which such a reduction leads to an _ enhancement _ in the current . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the increased motility of some kinesins has been attributed to a larger flexibility of the neck linker . however , whether such simplified models can ever reflect the underlying behaviour of vastly more complex biological systems is unclear .",
