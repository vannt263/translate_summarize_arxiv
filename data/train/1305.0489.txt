    "the objects studied in this paper are fractional power expansions of algebraic functions @xmath0 such that @xmath1 is irreducible over the rationals with @xmath2 and @xmath3 complex variables and the coefficients , @xmath4 , polynomials in @xmath2 with rational coefficients .",
    "the degree of the function is the highest power of @xmath3 . by the implicit function theorem ,",
    "this equation defines locally , an analytic function @xmath5 when @xmath6 . and by newton - puiseux s theorem@xcite",
    ", @xmath7 can be factored over the field of fractional power series , @xmath8 as @xmath9 where each @xmath10 is a branch , possibly multivalued , of the function .",
    "these fractional power series have a radius of convergence at least equal to the distance to the nearest singular point .",
    "however , one result of this paper is to demonstrate the actual radius of convergence can and often does extend beyond many singular points . in the test cases described below , one branch is shown to extend across @xmath11 singular points .",
    "since the current methods for computing fractional power series of algebraic functions rely on iterative means @xcite , radii of convergence , in general , can not be calculated by the ordinary techniques such as the ratio test or root test .",
    "this paper describes a method to compute these values precisely .",
    "the purpose of this paper is four - fold :    1 .   describe in detail , the newton polygon algorithm as described by kung @xcite , 2 .",
    "demonstrate that a numeric version of newton polygon can be implemented with satisfactory results , 3 .",
    "implement an algorithm for determining the radius of convergence of an algebraic power series , 4 .   provide a software tool for further investigating algebraic functions",
    "fractional power expansions of algebraic functions are called puiseux series and are in this paper computed by the method of newton polygon .",
    "these series often represents only a small portion of the function near the origin .",
    "however , the entire function can be represented by puiseux series in annular discs surrounding the origin .",
    "these annular expansions can in principle , be computed by numeric means using a modified version of laurent s expansion theorem and if computed accurately , can be used in the algorithms below to determine their annular domain of convergence .",
    "however , this paper focuses only on power series inside the disc @xmath12 .",
    "the resultant of @xmath1 with it s derivative @xmath13 is denoted by @xmath14 .",
    "a point where one or both of @xmath15 or @xmath14 is zero is a singular point of @xmath16 .",
    "a point where @xmath17 is also a pole , possibly ramified , of the function . in this paper ,",
    "singular points are labeled as @xmath18 .",
    "a property of algebraic functions which distinguishes them from single - valued functions is algebraic functions can be both singular and analytic at a singular point .",
    "that is , a singular point may not affect all coverings of an algebraic function unless the function is fully - ramified at the singular point .",
    "for example , a @xmath19-degree function may have only a single @xmath20-cycle branch and eight @xmath21-cycle coverings at a singular point . in this case , the @xmath20-cycle covering is singular .",
    "the eight single - cycle coverings are not analytically affected at this singular point unless one is affected by a pole of the function . however",
    ", if the function fully - ramifies into a @xmath19-cycle branch at this singular point , all coverings would be affected .",
    "it is for this reason algebraic power series can have a radius of convergence extending beyond the first singular point : their branch coverings may simply not be singular at a singular point .",
    "only when the covering becomes singular does the convergence radius of its power expansion become established .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to identify which singular point is interrupting the analyticity of branch cycles thereby establishing the radius of convergence of their power expansions .",
    "the following conventions are used in this paper :    1 .",
    "the puiseux expansions of the roots of @xmath7 consist of a set of @xmath22-valued branches .",
    "a branch is sometimes called a @xmath22-cycle where @xmath22 is a positive integer . a power series in @xmath23",
    "would be a @xmath24-cycle branch .",
    "it has three coverings over the complex @xmath2-plane just like the function @xmath25{z}$ ] .",
    "the sum of the cycles is always equal to the degree of the function in @xmath3 .",
    "2 .   in order to identify a particular branch , @xmath5 of @xmath16 ,",
    "a two - level identification is used .",
    "the first level is the cycle number representing the number of coverings .",
    "the second identifier is the sort order of the branch : a base point @xmath26 on the real axis is selected mid - way between the origin and a disc of radius equal to the distance to the nearest non - zero singular point .",
    "when the function has multiple @xmath22-cycle branches , the values @xmath27 are computed and ordered by increasing real part then imaginary part .",
    "the first value in the sort order for each branch is identified and the branches are then ordered according to this sort order as @xmath28 and so forth .",
    "the concept of `` branch '' is used throughout this paper and differs in meaning to the definition encountered in basic complex analysis . in this paper",
    ", the term `` branch '' refers to a multi - valued @xmath22-cycle root of @xmath1 given by @xmath29 .",
    "4 .   the following discussion makes use of the term , `` extending a branch over a singular point '' .",
    "this is in reference to the discussion above about singularities and the coverings they affect .",
    "5 .   in this paper",
    ", @xmath30 is a positive integer representing a singular ring when non - zero singular points are arranged in order of increasing absolute value .",
    "the smallest non - zero singular point is therefore on ring one , singular points with the next largest absolute value are on ring two and so forth .",
    "@xmath31 however , represents the absolute value of the associated singular points .",
    "given @xmath7 , we seek to compute power expansions @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the normal exponent and @xmath22 is the cycle number , for all branches of the function .",
    "the simplest method of computing @xmath34 is by the method of newton polygon . for a function of degree @xmath35 in @xmath3 ,",
    "the method computes a set of @xmath35 series representing the roots of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the actual branches of the function are often multivalued and ramify or wind around the origin multiple times . for example , a ten - degree function can ramify into a single - valued branch , a @xmath20-cycle branch , a @xmath24-cycle , and @xmath36-cycle branch",
    ". four of the power series computed by the method would be conjugates of the @xmath36-cycle , three series , conjugates of the @xmath24-cycle , and so forth .",
    "thus in the case of the @xmath36-cycle branch , the algorithm produces the set @xmath37 in the particular implementation of the algorithm presented here , a basis set of power series is produced consisting of a single power series for each @xmath22-cycle branch .",
    "the remaining conjugate series can be computed from the basis series using the appropriate form of ( [ eqn0010 ] ) .",
    "a theoretical basis for the newton polygon algorithm can be found in walker @xcite .",
    "the particular implementation of the algorithm for this paper is taken from kung @xcite , a flowchart of which is shown in figure @xmath38 .",
    "we begin first by representing a branch as @xmath39 in which @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the steps in the process are as follows :    1 .",
    "normalizing the function : + in order to achieve the requirement above on the exponents @xmath44 , the function is normalized to eliminate negative exponents in the expansion .",
    "the normalization process removes algebraic poles at the origin from the function which arise when zero is a root of @xmath15 .",
    "for example , @xmath45 has a pole at the origin and thus one branch of the function would have a negative exponent in its expansion .",
    "the normalization process produces for this function , @xmath46 which in this case @xmath47 .",
    "we can then expand @xmath48 around the origin , which now has no singular point there and hence no expansions with negative exponents , and then multiply each series by the quantity @xmath49 to arrive at the expansions for @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   computing the newton polygon and extracting the lower newton leg : + the principle device for beginning the computation of the coefficients @xmath50 for the series is the newton polygon which for the function @xmath1 is the convex hull of it s support .",
    "the support of the function is a set of points , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the order of @xmath4 is the lowest power of @xmath2 in @xmath4 with the exception that if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 and the point @xmath55 is omitted .",
    "drawing the convex hull of these points and taking the left - most lowest segments so that all remaining points are either above or to the right of the segments then gives the lower newton leg .",
    "the newton polygon for @xmath56 is shown in figure @xmath57 . in this example",
    ", the lower newton leg has four segments given by the red lines .",
    "the blue dashed lines provide the slope and vertical intercept for each segment which gives the exponents @xmath58 and @xmath59 discussed below .",
    "+ ] 3 .   deriving the characteristic equation : + choose a segment from the lower newton leg and form the characteristic equation of the segment .",
    "the principle is based on letting @xmath60 and then making the substitution @xmath61 .",
    "extracting the lowest power of @xmath2 alone and setting it to zero then provides a means of computing @xmath62 .",
    "however , the form of the characteristic equation can be read off directly from the polygon diagram : for each segment , choose the points intersected by the segment .",
    "in the case of figure @xmath57 , the top most segment intersects the points @xmath63 and @xmath64 . these are from the order-14 term of @xmath65 and the order-5 term of @xmath66 .",
    "now choose the coefficient of each of those terms and label them @xmath67 .",
    "in the two cases above , we have @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we can write this set of points as : @xmath70",
    "now form the characteristic equation @xmath71 with @xmath72 being the total number of points .",
    "this give for the segment above , @xmath73 .",
    "the @xmath74 distinct , non - zero solutions to the characteristic equation are the first coefficients @xmath62 of @xmath74 power series for the function . if the zeros are multiple roots , then we create a series for each set of multiple roots by setting @xmath62 for each root , and let @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the negative of the slope for the segment and @xmath77 , the vertical intercept of the segment .",
    "we then compute a second - level polygon for @xmath78 with the exception that segments with zero slopes are now omitted from the newton leg , derive a second characteristic equation for @xmath79 , and continue in this way if necessary for @xmath80 and so forth until we reach @xmath81 with simple roots for its characteristic equation .",
    "4 .   convert to regular form : + once simple roots are obtained for the characteristic equation , we can use a variation of newton iteration to compute additional terms of the series . in order to use this method",
    ", we need a polynomial with integer powers ; the procedure above will often produce an expression with fractional powers .",
    "but we can convert the expression @xmath81 above to one with integer powers with the following two substitutions : @xmath82 where @xmath74 is the last recursion of the function which did not produce a characteristic equation with multiple roots , and @xmath22 is the lowest common denominator of the exponents @xmath83 .",
    "normal iteration : + the terms in @xmath84 not containing a factor of @xmath2 make up the characteristic equation in @xmath3 so that the first simple root computed above , @xmath85 , is a zero to @xmath86 .",
    "that is , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we let in the iteration step below , @xmath88 .",
    "we can see this with @xmath89 .",
    "the first segment produces a characteristic equation of @xmath90 .",
    "when we process the function as above , @xmath91 and therefore , the root of the characteristic equation is a root of @xmath86 .",
    "the iteration process is a variation of newton iteration , a description of which can be found in kung .",
    "we let @xmath92 where the mod function is simply extracting the @xmath93 terms of the taylor series of the quotient . after a set number of iterations we obtain the @xmath35-th iteration and",
    "write for the branch , @xmath94 where @xmath33 is the normal exponent of the function . in this way , the method produces @xmath35 power series for an @xmath35-th degree function .",
    "existing implementations of newton polygon use exact arithmetic due to the possibility of numerical errors that produce incorrect polygon results . however , these exact methods limit the types of functions that can be studied due to the computational complexity , storage space and execution times involved . in this paper , a numeric version of the method",
    "is implemented and shown to produce acceptable results for a variety of different function types .",
    "numerical approximations however introduce the following issues :    1 .   multiple root resolution , 2 .",
    "residual coefficients close to zero , 3 .",
    "loss of accuracy due to coefficient expansion or contraction , 4 .",
    "numerical integration drift .",
    "these issues are dealt with as follows :      given the function : @xmath95 when we create the polygon for this equation , we obtain as the characteristic equation for @xmath62 , @xmath96 solving this for @xmath97 using machine - precision , the roots are @xmath98 so that if we used a tolerance of just @xmath99 , we would not pick up the multiple roots . in order to successfully resolve the multiple roots , the algorithm must check the roots against the accuracy of the computation . if the roots do not differ by this accuracy , then the algorithm used in this study considers the roots multiples .",
    "mathematica has features to monitor and control the accuracy and precision of all computations .",
    "we therefore begin the algorithm by computing the singular points of the function with a high degree of precision .",
    "this then determines the initial precision of succeeding calculations . in this study ,",
    "the precision of the singular points , @xmath100 , was set between @xmath101 and @xmath102 digits .",
    "we then carefully monitor the accuracy of the computations .",
    "if the number of significant digits or precision of a computation drops to zero , then the quantity is considered numerically zero .",
    "consider the two numbers : @xmath103 these numbers differ in the 21th decimal place .",
    "therefore , if the accuracy or number of significant digits to the right of the decimal place of the numbers is set to a value greater than 21 , then the precision of the difference @xmath104 will be greater than zero .",
    "however , if the accuracy of the numbers are both set to 20 , then the precision of the difference @xmath104 drops to zero .",
    "this is the principle used to check both for multiple roots and residual coefficients in the computations .",
    "if the roots of the characteristic equation are computed to @xmath105 digits of accuracy and then that accuracy is manually decreased to @xmath106 , then multiple roots @xmath107 and @xmath108 when subtracted , will produce a number with zero significant figures or zero precision .",
    "likewise , if during the newton polygon phase of the computation , the precision of the iterates , @xmath109 , drops to zero when the accuracy is manually decreased to an accuracy below its current accuracy , then that value is considered numerically zero and dropped .",
    "this of course raises the possibility of numerical error if significant results are below this threshold .",
    "however the algorithms designed in this paper were written with diagnostic tools to detect this and other possible errors due to numerical precision .",
    "one tool is a table reporting the difference @xmath110 for all roots of the characteristic equation .",
    "the user can visually inspect these values if there is a concern for numerical error . another tool reports all residual terms removed from the computations . these can also be checked and if necessary ,",
    "the precision of the computations increased .",
    "one limiting factor affecting the accuracy of the results is the computation of roots to the characteristic equation .",
    "the accuracy of the roots is a function of the precision of the input data .",
    "another factor is the quotient @xmath111 in the iteration phase of the calculation .",
    "after each iteration , the accuracy of the results is usually less than the input data .",
    "after several iterations , the accuracy can drop significantly . in this implementation of the algorithm ,",
    "the accuracy of all results are continuously checked and if it goes below zero , the algorithm stops and prompts the user to increase the precision of the calculations .    for complicated functions such as the twenty - degree function studied in test [ testcase005 ] ,",
    "the newton iteration process produces extremely large coefficients on the order of several hundred .",
    "therefore , if the precision of the initial data was only @xmath112 digits , and the coefficients blow - up to values exceeding @xmath113 , then the number of significant digits to the right of the decimal place drop to zero or even negative .",
    "the solution to this problem is simply to increase the precision of the input data . in order to detect when this occurs ,",
    "the accuracy of the computations are checked and when the accuracy drops below zero , the user is notified to increase the working precision .",
    "the function studied in test [ testcase005 ] has a third - order pole located at the origin . during the numerical integration phase of the continuation algorithm ,",
    "the starting point for the integration is very close to the origin . during the testing , the numerical results varied greatly from the expected results .",
    "although this problem may have been addressed by careful tuning of the numerical integrator , another remedy is to use the normalized function for the continuation analysis as was done in the test since the pole at the origin is removed .",
    "another potential problem is when the integration path encounters widely - varying function values or if the path is very long . in test [ testcase006 ] ,",
    "the integration path is of the order of @xmath114 .",
    "if a numerical problem is suspected , the precision of the numerical integration can be increased in an effort to resolve it .",
    "another solution is to carefully monitor the integration as was done for test [ testcase006 ] as described in the conclusion section below .",
    "the geometry of algebraic functions described above is used to determine the radii of convergence of their associated power series .",
    "the process is depicted in figures @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in general , the procedure checks each branch of the function for analytic continuity over singular points .",
    "figure @xmath116 shows the setup over the first singular point in red which has a nearest neighbor in blue .",
    "the first step is to compute the expansion around the origin .",
    "this expansion will converge at least to the nearest singular point with distance @xmath117 in the figure .",
    "the value of the function is then computed at one - half the distance of @xmath117 at the point @xmath118 using the expansions computed above .",
    "these values are then adjusted to the actual values as determined by the function @xmath119 .",
    "the algorithm first determines the smallest difference between the roots of @xmath120 .",
    "this value is given by @xmath121 .",
    "all comparisons are then made to a tolerance of @xmath122 where @xmath123 is an integer which in the test cases below , was @xmath124 .",
    "if this tolerance is not met at the current number of terms of the series , the the user is prompted to generate series with more terms .",
    "the next step is to numerically extend each branch from @xmath118 in a radial direction to @xmath125 .",
    "this is done using the differential equation for the function with initial value at @xmath118 .",
    "these values are adjusted to the exact values at this point using the method described above .",
    "the third step is to compute the local expansion around the selected singular point .",
    "we know these expansions will converge in a radius at least equal to the distance to the nearest singular point or @xmath126 . taking one - half the distance , we compute the value of each local branch at @xmath125 and adjust for exact values . if the analytically - continued values from @xmath118 to @xmath125 impinge upon ramified branches or poles at @xmath18 , and if the singular points were processed in sequential order , the power series has a radius of convergence equal to this singular ring .",
    "if a branch at the origin does not impinge onto local singular branches for all singular points in a ring , the power series for this branch has a radius of convergence beyond this ring .",
    "we continue in this fashion until no further continuations are possible .",
    "the details of each step are as follows : +            1 .",
    "computing the singular points @xmath100 : + in this study , the singular points were computed to sufficient precision to mimimize the potential for possible numerical errors described above .",
    "this precision was usually between @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "2 .   computing the function basis @xmath127 : + the function basis is the set of conjugately - distinct power series centered at the origin .",
    "thus for a @xmath36-cycle , the basis would have only one series representing this branch .",
    "likewise for the other multi - valued branches . as many as @xmath128 terms of a series were generated in this study .",
    "computing @xmath129 and @xmath130 : + a line is drawn from the origin to the selected singular point . on this line and one - half the distance to the first singular point ,",
    "the point @xmath118 is chosen . using the basis computed above",
    ", we compute the values of the function branches at @xmath118 .",
    "these values will differ from the exact values ( to numerical precision ) of @xmath120 , depending on how many terms of the series are used .",
    "the values are adjusted by comparing the computed value @xmath131 to the ideal values and choosing the closest match and then checking that the computed values are less than @xmath132 .",
    "the exact values are @xmath130 .",
    "4 .   continue @xmath130 to the point @xmath125 : + for each singular point , the distance to it s nearest neighbor is computed .",
    "we choose a point which is one - half this distance and on the line to the origin and mark a point @xmath125 .",
    "if this point is smaller in absolute value to @xmath118 , it is adjusted ( made smaller ) so that @xmath133",
    ". now using the differential equation for the function , @xmath134 we numerically continue each branch from @xmath118 to the point @xmath125 , and as was done with @xmath118 , adjust the values to the closest match , @xmath135 .",
    "5 .   compute basis @xmath136 at selected singular point : + we next compute the basis around the chosen singular point @xmath18 by making the substitution @xmath137 and thus an expansion around zero for @xmath48 is an expansion of @xmath1 around @xmath18 .",
    "the singular points are chosen in sequential order according to their radial distance from the origin in order to avoid integrating over a singularity .",
    "this could occur if two singular points are in alignment with the numerical integration path and analyticity over the closest singular point was not checked prior to checking the more distant point .",
    "the basis , @xmath136 , will contain at least one singular branch .",
    "this singularity will either be a pole and or a ramified branch with multiple values .",
    "poles and ramified branches are barriers to extending the radius of convergence of power expansions across singular points and therefore if a branch from the basis @xmath127 impinges upon any of the singular branches of @xmath136 at @xmath18 , its power series has a ring of convergence equal to the ring number of the current ring , @xmath138 . if a branch does not impinge upon the singular branches @xmath136 for all singular points of a ring , then the series has a radius of convergence which extends across this singular point .",
    "we therefore select the singular branches from @xmath136 , compute @xmath139 for each sheet of the branch , adjust those values to their exact values , and then compare those values to each of the continued values @xmath140 .",
    "any branches in which @xmath141 to numerical precision has a power series with a radius of convergence equal to @xmath142 .",
    "branches which do not agree are then checked against the next singular point .",
    "continue the above process until no remaining series can be extended over the next singular point .",
    "in order to obtain some empirical measure of the accuracy of the test results , all power series were checked with values @xmath143 and @xmath144 such that @xmath145 and @xmath146 with adjustments made if @xmath30 is the first or last ring .",
    "if the computed ring of convergence is correct and the series are precise , the partial sums will exhibit convergent behavior in the former case and divergent behavior in the later case .",
    "additionally , the series were checked against @xmath124 random points in the range @xmath147 with the values compared against the expected value given by the function @xmath148 .",
    "the maximum error of the set is reported in the tables .      1",
    ".   function with cycles one through four : [ testcase001 ] @xmath149 continuation results for function @xmath150 are shown in table @xmath151 .",
    "the test was run with a precision of @xmath152 using @xmath153 terms of each series .",
    "note the continuation column . in the first row , the four and three cycle branches are continuable over the first singular point .",
    "these series then have a radius of convergence at least equal to the absolute value of the second singular point or approximately 0.3329 .",
    "note however , only the @xmath24-cycle branch is continuable across the singular points in the second and third rings but not the fourth .",
    "this means @xmath154 has a radius of convergence equal to the size of the fourth ring or approximately 0.636 .",
    "+ convergence results are tabulated in table @xmath155 with @xmath30 representing the ring of convergence as described above .",
    "the partial sum analysis was run for each branch and agreed with the computed radii of convergences in the table .",
    "divergent behavior for @xmath154 and @xmath156 was not observed until both partial sums had accumulated more than @xmath157 terms .",
    "+ . @xmath158 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the limiting factor controlling radii of convergence of algebraic power series is branch - sheet continuation to either a ramified covering or single - sheet pole .",
    "this was the principle factor used in the continuation algorithm described in this paper . for each test case studied , the partial - sum testing agreed with the computed radii of convergence for all branches : the partial sums exhibited convergent behavior for @xmath159 , and showed divergent behavior in for @xmath160 . and since the singular points are the roots to the resultant polynomial with rational coefficients , these values can be computed to arbitrary precision for a wide class of functions .",
    "however , the software may require tuning for a particular function .",
    "for example , the algorithms rely on determining an exact match for function values when these values are only computed approximately .",
    "the matching is done by finding the closest match to within a tolerance of @xmath161 of the smallest separation between function values .",
    "the code will detect when this tolerance is not met and will prompt the user to either generate more terms of the series in the newton polygon phase or to numerically integrate with a higher working precision .",
    "other potential problems could come from extremely close polynomial roots , very small or large coefficients encountered during the analysis , algebraic branches which have their sheets extremely close to one another , and other errors associated with numerical integration of a differential equation as was shown in test @xmath162 .",
    "steps to identify these errors were described above and diagnostic tools were designed to identify possible problems .",
    "consider test [ testcase006 ] .",
    "the singular points are extremely large and therefore , numerical integration from the point @xmath118 to @xmath125 has to traverse increasingly large distances .",
    "one branch extends out to @xmath163 .",
    "how can we be certain the integration does not over - track the branch and land on a different sheet along the integration path ?",
    "one way to minimize this is to integrate over a well - behaved section of the function .",
    "this function has no poles and so is well - behaved along the integration paths .",
    "another way is to integrate with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "the test case used an accuracy goal of @xmath164 digits . and",
    "still a third way of handling this possible problem is with diagnostic tools .",
    "the code written for this work has an option for reporting the results of the integration .",
    "table @xmath165 is an example of one such diagnostic tool .",
    "it was generated during the analysis of test [ testcase006 ] about the seventh singular point near @xmath166 .",
    "the values are however reported to six decimal places to avoid clutter and so some numeric quantities for this particular function appear to either be identical or zero but are actually different at a greater precision .",
    "the important point is the last column which reports the difference between the actual value of the function at @xmath125 and the value determined by numerical integration .",
    "the table reports that after integrating a distance of approximately @xmath167 , the integration did not vary by more than @xmath168 and since the maximum distance between the sheets at @xmath125 was approximately unity , this small difference compared to the sheet separations lends credence to the accuracy of the results . in this case , the sheets of the function were basically flat .",
    "however , had the sheets values varied greatly in the integration intervals , the analysis may have encountered problems .    however , as stated earlier , one objective of this work was to produce a first version of a software tool that could successfully compute puiseux series and their radii of convergence for a wide variety of functions not accessible by exact arithmetic means .",
    "as best as could be determined , the algorithm produced good results for the test cases that were studied .",
    "if all phases of the analysis are carefully monitored with the available diagnostic tools , the potential for errors can be reduced .",
    "still though , the code has much room for improvement and can provide a means of computing radii of convergence precisely for the types of functions studied in this paper .",
    "a greater variety of function types such as those with more polygon recursions , functions with higher ramified singular points , more complicated coefficients , or other morphologies to stress - test the software would produce a more robust algorithm as would a more careful analysis of the accuracy of the computations .",
    "one might consider using the partial sum testing to conceivably compute these convergence radii .",
    "simply compute a highly accurate series with many terms and check it s partial sum behavior in successive rings until it begins to diverge .",
    "however , the point at which the series begins to diverge is not known and as was observed in the test , the partial sum may even appear to slowly converge and then start to diverge .",
    "this is what happened for the four and three - cycle branches in test [ testcase001 ] .    in principle",
    ", we should be able to dispense with the numerical integration step of the continuation algorithm since the convergence domain of the power series being checked , and convergence domain of the power series centered at the chosen singular point will always overlap using the method described in this paper .",
    "we would then need only compare the values from two different power series .",
    "doing this would eliminate the numerical integration step in the algorithm thus avoiding potential numerical errors .",
    "however , this would entail the possibility of computing the value of a power series at a point very close to it s radius of convergence and near a singularity so might require the need for many terms to achieve a desired accuracy .",
