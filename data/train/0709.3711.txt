    "the analysis of photoemission data indicates @xmath30 , i.e. , a ct character.@xcite yet , most theoretical approaches employ an effective hubbard model ( see below ) . both mh and ct types",
    "have been proposed on the basis of optical data.@xcite for @xmath31 or @xmath32 , there are different ways to disentangle mh and ct excitations in the optical conductivity .",
    "first , the spectral weight of ct excitations is larger , e.g. , @xmath33500 @xmath34@xmath35 for mh and @xmath365000 @xmath34@xmath35 for ct excitations in latio@xmath29.@xcite this can be attributed to the tm@xmath37-o@xmath38 hopping amplitude @xmath39 : @xmath40 for ct and @xmath41 for mh excitations ( see below ) .",
    "second , the polarization dependence may be very different , depending on the crystal structure .",
    "in layered lasrmno@xmath1 , the interlayer mn - mn hopping is strongly suppressed ; thus , the contribution of mh excitations should be negligible in @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , ct excitations contribute to both @xmath2 and @xmath4 due to the octahedral o coordination of the mn sites .",
    "third , the spin and orbital selection rules are different , giving rise to a different behavior of the spectral weight as a function of temperature @xmath42.@xcite as an example , we consider a mh insulator with a single @xmath14 band and one electron per tm site . in the case of ferromagnetic order ,",
    "the spectral weight of mh excitations is zero due to the pauli principle ( neglecting spin - orbit coupling , the total spin is conserved in an optical excitation ) .",
    "thus , one expects a drastic change of the spectral weight upon heating across the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "in contrast , the o @xmath21 band is completely filled and the spectral weight of ct excitations is independent of the magnetic properties . for comparison with experimental data ,",
    "the orbital multiplicity has to be taken into account and the optical spectra of mh excitations contain valuable information on orbital occupation and nearest - neighbor spin and orbital correlations .",
    "this kind of analysis has been applied to a number of different tm compounds ( mn , v , ru , mo).@xcite in lamno@xmath29 , there is some disagreement on the experimental side : lamno@xmath29 has been interpreted as mh type due to a pronounced @xmath42 dependence observed by spectroscopic ellipsometry@xcite and as ct type due to the absence of a significant @xmath42 dependence across the neel temperature @xmath11 in reflectivity measurements.@xcite note that it is still unclear in which compounds this kind of analysis can be applied . for instance , in ytio@xmath29 , the lowest mh excitation shows a strong @xmath42 dependence but only a weak dependence on the magnetic properties.@xcite however , our analysis of lasrmno@xmath1 fully corroborates the intimate relation between spectral weight and magnetism reported by kovaleva _",
    "et al._@xcite for lamno@xmath29 .",
    "does this prove that lamno@xmath29 and lasrmno@xmath1 are of mh type ?",
    "the @xmath43 configuration is particularly stable .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 configuration has a strong @xmath44 contribution , where @xmath45 denotes a ligand hole and the o @xmath21 orbitals certainly play an important role .",
    "as stated above , with @xmath46,@xcite the manganites may be categorized as ct type .",
    "however , for the analysis of , e.g. , optical data , it is important to consider the symmetry .",
    "let us discuss the simplified case of a single , half - filled @xmath14 band and degenerate , full o @xmath21 bands .",
    "due to hybridization , one has to distinguish bonding ( b ) , antibonding ( ab ) , and nonbonding ( nb ) bands below the fermi level ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the ab band is the highest occupied one .",
    "it has mainly tm character for @xmath25 and mainly o character for @xmath26 . for the intermediate situation @xmath47 ,",
    "the character is strongly mixed .",
    "however , in the manganites with a less than half - filled @xmath14 shell , the _ symmetry _ of the ab band is determined by the symmetry of the @xmath14 band , i.e. , it can be described in terms of a wannier orbital with @xmath48 symmetry centered around a mn site . in particular , the spin and orbital selection rules mentioned above for a mh insulator apply also to the ab band .",
    "these selection rules are most important for understanding the optical data .",
    "for instance , in lasrmno@xmath1 , one expects that the ab band shows the pronounced anisotropy and the strong temperature dependence discussed above for the mh case .",
    "thus , _ `` mh or ct '' _ is not the essential question for @xmath47 and strong hybridization . in this sense",
    ", we analyze our data in terms of an _ effective _ hubbard model with a rather small value of @xmath5=2.2 ev .",
    "excitations from nb to uhb are treated as ct and from ab to uhb as mh .",

    "the effective model does not contain the b band , which is important for optical or photoemission measurements at higher energies .",

    ", the interlayer mn - mn hopping is strongly suppressed and mh excitations can be neglected in the @xmath13 direction . this is the main reason for the pronounced anisotropy observed experimentally and suggests the following interpretation : the peak at @xmath365.6 ev in @xmath158 is a ct excitation and the same holds true for the strong excitations in the same energy range in @xmath159 .",

    "therefore , we can not identify the peak at 5.6 ev in @xmath166 with the _ lowest _ ct transition .",
    "the second lowest ct excitation in the strong crystal - field limit corresponds to a transfer of one electron from o @xmath21 into the degenerate @xmath167 orbitals , i.e. , to a final state with @xmath168 @xmath55=3/2 .",

    "<S> using spectroscopic ellipsometry , we study the optical conductivity @xmath0 of insulating lasrmno@xmath1 in the energy range of 0.75 - 5.8 ev from 15 to 330 k. the layered structure gives rise to a pronounced anisotropy . a multipeak structure </S>",
    "<S> is observed in @xmath2 ( @xmath3 , 3.5 , 4.5 , 4.9 , and 5.5 ev ) , while only one peak is present at 5.6 ev in @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a local multiplet calculation and obtain ( i ) an excellent description of the optical data , ( ii ) a detailed peak assignment in terms of the multiplet splitting of mott - hubbard and charge - transfer absorption bands , and ( iii ) _ effective _ parameters of the electronic structure , e.g. , the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath5=2.2 ev , the in - plane charge - transfer energy @xmath6=4.5 ev , and the crystal - field parameters for the @xmath7 configuration ( @xmath8=1.2 ev , @xmath9=1.4 ev , and @xmath10=0.2 ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral weight of the lowest absorption feature ( at 1 - 2 ev ) changes by a factor of 2 as a function of temperature , which can be attributed to the change of the nearest - neighbor spin - spin correlation function across the neel temperature @xmath11=133 k. interpreting lasrmno@xmath1 effectively as a mott - hubbard insulator naturally explains this strong temperature dependence , the relative weight of the different absorption peaks , and the pronounced anisotropy . by means of transmittance measurements , </S>",
    "<S> we determine the onset of the optical gap @xmath12 = 0.4 - 0.45 ev at 15 k and 0.1 - 0.2 ev at 300 k. our data show that the crystal - field splitting is too large to explain the anomalous temperature dependence of the @xmath13-axis lattice parameter by thermal occupation of excited crystal - field levels . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we propose that a thermal population of the upper hubbard band gives rise to the shrinkage of the @xmath13-axis lattice parameter . </S>"
