    "recently , dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) put forth a model of gravity @xcite which allows to explain the observed accelerated expansion of our universe without resorting to the concept of dark energy . in such a picture",
    "our universe is a ( 3 + 1 ) space - time brane embeddeed in a 5-dimensional minkowskian bulk .",
    "while the dynamics of the standard model particles and fields is confined to our brane , gravity can fully explore the entire bulk getting strongly modified at large distances of the order of @xmath8 gpc .",
    "an intermediate regime is set by the vainshtein scale @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the schwarzschild radius of a central object acting as source of gravitational field . for a sun - like star @xmath11",
    "amounts to about 100 parsec .",
    "an updated overview of the phenomenology of dgp gravity can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting features of such a picture is that in the process of recovering the 4-dimensional newton - einstein gravity for @xmath12 , dgp predicts small deviations from it which yield to effects observable at local scales @xcite .",
    "they come from an extra radial acceleration of the form @xcite a_dgp=().[acc ] the minus sign is related to a cosmological phase in which , in absence of cosmological constant on the brane , the universe decelerates at late times , the hubble parameter @xmath13 tending to zero as the matter dissolves on the brane : it is called friedmann - lema@xmath14tre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) branch .",
    "the plus sign is related to a cosmological phase in which the universe undergoes a desitter expansion with the hubble parameter @xmath15 even in absence of matter .",
    "this is the self - accelerated branch , where the accelerated expansion of the universe is realized without introducing a cosmological constant on the brane .",
    "thus , there is a very important connection between local and cosmological features of gravity in the dgp model . about the local effects ,",
    "lue and starkman @xcite derived an extra - secular precession of the pericentre @xmath0 of a nearly circular orbit of a test particle of @xmath16 arcseconds per century ( ) , while iorio @xcite showed that also the mean anomaly @xmath17 is affected by dgp gravity at a larger extent ; the longitude of the ascending node @xmath18 is left unchanged . as a result , the mean longitude @xmath19 , which is a widely used orbital parameter for nearly equatorial and circular orbits as those of the solar system planets , undergoes a secular precession of the order of @xmath20 .",
    "it is independent of the semi - major axis @xmath5 of the planetary orbits and depends only on their eccentricities @xmath4 via second - order terms .",
    "recent improvements in the accuracy of the data reduction process for the inner planets of the solar system @xcite , which can be tracked via radar - ranging , have made the possibility of testing dgp very thrilling @xcite .",
    "in particular , iorio @xcite showed that the recently observed secular increase of the astronomical unit @xcite can be explained by the self - accelerated branch of dgp and that the predicted values of the lue - starkman perihelion precessions for the self - accelerated branch are compatible with the recently determined extra - perihelion advances @xcite , especially for mars , although the errors are still large .",
    "there are still some issues about the theoretical consistency of the dgp model , so that direct , local observational tests would be very useful and important to tackle observationally this matter .",
    "the recovery of the newton - einstein four dimensional gravity is rather not trivial .",
    "the aforementioned orbital effects come from the correction to the newtonian potential of a schwarzschild source found in @xcite .",
    "such a potential is obtained within a certain approximation which is valid below the vainshtein scale .",
    "however , it is not yet clear , at present , whether this potential can match continuously onto a four - dimensional newtonian potential above the vainshtein scale , and then , also match onto the five - dimensional potential above the crossover scale @xmath21 .",
    "an alternative solution that smoothly interpolates between the different regions was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the correction to the newtonian potential arising from that solution below the vainshtein scale is somewhat different from what used here .",
    "in particular , it is reduced by a multiplicative factor smaller than unity . as a consequence ,",
    "the predictions are also different . moreover , according to the authors of @xcite , ghosts affect the self - accelerated branch , plaguing the consistency of the model at cosmological scales . in regard to the domain below the vainshtein scale , according to @xcite a ghost appears in the pauli - fierz model of massive gravity , while it is absent in dgp on the conventional branch .",
    "a similar result has also been obtained in @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out , up to now the only available preliminary tests of the dgp gravity refer to the inner planets of the solar system . in this paper",
    "we focus on the outer planets in order to enlarge the possible set of independent checks . for such celestial bodies many competing newtonian and einsteinian effects are smaller than the dgp features of motion allowing , in principle , cleaner tests of the lue - starkman and iorio precessions .",
    "we list the dgp precessions and the competing newtonian and einsteinian precessions in table [ sensi ] , taken from @xcite , for the mean longitudes .",

    "it occurs for all such features of motion apart from the lense - thirring effect , which is not modelled at all in the currently used ephemeris softwares , and the solar quadrupole mass moment @xmath6 which is , in fact , modelled but whose uncertainty is of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "such dynamical features induce residual mismodelled precessions which could seriously affect the recovery of a smaller effect .",
    "otherwise , it could be possible to suitably combine the orbital elements in order to a priori cancel out some of the unwanted perturbations .",
    "a careful inspection of table [ sensi ] shows that for the outer planets of the solar system - and for mars - the nominal values of the lt and @xmath6 precessions are themselves well smaller than the dgp rate .",
    "the nominal ge precessions are larger but by a sufficiently small amount to create no problems because they are routinely included in the dynamical force models in terms of the ppn parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 @xcite which are known with an accuracy of @xmath62 @xcite or better @xcite .",
    "moreover , deviations from their relativistic values are expected at the level of @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "the newtonian n - body precessions are known very well and the impact of the asteroids , which limits the obtainable accuracy for the inner planets with particular emphasis on mars , is , of course , negligible .",
    "so , at first sight , it would seem appealing to consider such planets as ideal candidates to test dgp gravity because of the absence of competing aliasing effects which could mask it .",
    "this feeling is enforced by the ongoing cassini tour of the saturn system which started at the end of 2004 and should last for almost five years .",
    "lue @xcite hoped that the precise radio - link to cassini might , indeed , provide ideal test for the anomalous periheion precession .",
    "unfortunately , the situation is in fact rather unfavorable for the outer planets .",
    "indeed , it must be pointed out that the investigated effect is a secular one , i.e. it is integrated over one orbital period of the planet .",
    "the currently available modern observations for the outer planets span almost one century and cover a limited number of full orbital revolutions of jupiter ( @xmath64 yr ) , saturn ( @xmath65 yr ) and uranus ( @xmath66 yr ) . up to now",
    ", the orbit of jupiter is the best known among the outer planets because a number of precise radar observations by spacecraft ( pioneer 10 and 11 , voyager 1 and 2 , ulysses and galileo ) approaching the planet or orbiting it have been performed .",
    "the other planets rely entirely upon optical observations .",

    "another source of limiting systematic bias is represented by the uncertainty @xmath71 in the keplerian mean motion @xmath72 induced by the errors @xmath73 in the semimajor axis .",
    "according to table [ pit ] , for jupiter and saturn we have @xmath74  which is one order of magnitude larger than the investigated effect . the situation is worse for the perihelia : indeed , the eccentricities of jupiter and saturn only amount to 0.04 and 0.05 , respectively , so that their apsidal lines are very difficult to be determined . as a consequence , from table [ pit ]",
    "it can be obtained an uncertainty up to 100 times larger than the lue - starkman perihelion precession .",
    "it is important to stress that such evaluations are based on the formal , statistical errors in the planetary orbital elements : realistic errors may be up to ten times larger .",
    "the keplerian orbital elements are not directly measured quantities : they are related to data in an indirect way . for the outer planets the true observables are the right ascension @xmath75 and the declination @xmath76 .",

    "this package has been also used in @xcite .",
    "the mercury package can use the following integration methods    * second order mixed - variable symplectic * bulirsh - stoer ( general ) * bulirsh - stoer ( conservative systems ) * everhardt radau 15th order * hybrid ( symplectic / bulirsh - stoer )    the perturbative force is introduced by giving the @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 components in an heliocentric frame of the corresponding acceleration .",
    "thanks to the experience gained during the integrations for @xcite , the everhardt radau method has been chosen as reference , due to its precision and speed .",
    "the initial epoch is 1913.0 ( jd 2419770.5 ) , and the initial planetary positions have been obtained from jpl ephemerides .    the integration has been performed twice , with and without the dgp acceleration of , and @xmath78 and @xmath76 have been calculated in both cases .",
    "the difference between @xmath78 and @xmath76 with and without the perturbation constitute the final results .",
    "they are represented in figure [ ju_ra]figure [ pl_de ] .    as a control",
    ", the same procedure has been performed adopting the bulirsh - stoer ( general ) method of integration ; the results are not reported here , because the resulting figures are exactly equal to those here presented ( the differences are at level of the sixth significative digit ) .    as can be noted ,",
    "the pattern which would be induced by a dgp perturbation on the planetary motions can not be discerned with the present - day orbital accuracy .",
