    "about 50 extrasolar planets have been discovered so far , among them : at least three confirmed planetary systems around the stars @xmath0 and with three jupiter mass planets ( e.g. laughlin & adams 1999 , rivera & lissauer 2000 ) ; hd 83443 with two saturn type companions ( mayor et al .",
    "2000 ) ; and gj 876 orbited by two resonant planets ( marcy et al .",
    "in addition there are two substellar - mass companions orbiting hd 168443 ( marcy et al .",
    "2001 , udry et al .",
    "2001 ) , a system of earth - mass planets around pulsar psr 1257 + 12 ( e.g. konacki et al .",
    "1998 ) , as well as yet - to - be - confirmed systems such as a second planet around 55 cnc ( jayawardhana et al . 2000 ) , planets orbiting lalande 21185 ( walker 1996 ) , and three earth - type planets around pulsar psr 1828 - 11 .",
    "no doubt the number of detected planetary systems will continue to increase rapidly due to the improvement of observational detection techniques and to new space missions ( e.g. kepler , corot , fame , sim etc . )",
    "scheduled for the next few years .",
    "the majority of members of new planetary systems have eccentric orbits .",
    "this may increase the dynamical interaction between components and make systems chaotic and potentially hierarchically unstable , ending up with an ejection of one or more ( in systems with more than 2 planets component ) to infinity .",
    "other main factors which add to uncertainty of the dynamical state of the systems are * ( a ) * the unknown value of orbital inclination @xmath1 , which allows us to know only the lower limit of planetary masses @xmath2 from the function @xmath3 , and leaves the real mass @xmath4 as almost a free parameter ( for attempts of @xmath1 estimation see gatewood et al .",
    "2001 , pourbaix 2001 ) , and * ( b ) * the unknown relative inclination between planetary orbital planes . also , usually the orbits in planetary systems are not keplerian because of mutual interaction between planets .",
    "therefore standard keplerian fits to velocity observations are strictly speaking not valid .",
    "this point was addressed by laughlin & chambers ( 2001 ) who suggested a new four - stage procedure for the determination of dynamical parameters of multiple planetary systems .",
    "this procedure includes multiple - keplerian fits using a semi - analytic scheme followed by a final self - consistent polish with n - body interations .",
    "this method should be a substantial improvement to existing fitting techniques .",
    "however , in cases when close approaches of two or more components are possible , one should take into account the non - point - mass nature of the bodies and , as a consequence , the following perturbations to newtonian gravity : ( * a * ) the quadrupolar distortion ( qd ) of the bodies due to their mutual gravity ; ( * b * ) the further quadrupolar distortion due intrinsic spin of the components ; ( * c * ) tidal friction ( tf ) ; ( * d * ) general relativity . in this paper",
    "we present a few examples showing the influence of two of these perturbations - ( * a * ) and ( * c*)- on dynamical stability of systems with two planets .",
    "in order to estimate the dynamical effects of quadrupolar distortion of interacting bodies due to their mutual distortion ( qd ) and to tidal friction ( tf ) , based here on the near - equlibrium approximation , on the planetary systems treated as n - body systems with extra forces due to qd and tf in addition to the newtonian gravity , we applied the following formulation for the force @xmath5 of one body on the other , developed by kiseleva , eggleton & mikkola ( 1998 ) - hereinafter kem98 :    @xmath6{{\\bf r}_{ij}}\\nonumber \\\\ + \\left[{27\\over 2}{\\sigma_i m_j^2a_i^2+\\sigma_jm_i^2a_j^2\\over{r_{ij}}^{10 } } { \\thinspace}{{\\bf r}_{ij}}.{\\hbox{$\\dot { \\bf r}_{ij}$}}\\right]{{\\bf r}_{ij}}{\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 here @xmath8 are the stellar or planetary radii , and @xmath9 are the dimensionless dissipation rates for the two bodies .",
    "@xmath10 is a version of the apsidal motion constant , a dimensionless measure of the distortability of the body ( star or planet ) .",
    "kem found that for a polytrope of index @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 , @xmath10 can be approximated by the interpolation formula @xmath13    we applied this model to the @xmath0 and planetary system .",
    "recently jiang & ip ( 2001 ) confirmed once more that the innermost planet does not affect very much the dynamics of the middle and outer planets , and so we ignored it in our simulations .",
    "for calculation we used the regularized chain method ( mikkola & aarseth 1993 ) with perturbations . the actual numerical integration of the equations of motion are carried out by a bulirsh - stoer integrator with a timestep accuracy of @xmath14 .    in our simulations",
    "we always used initial orbital parameters for orbital periods and eccentricities from the lick data ( butler et al .",
    "1999 , rivera & lissauer 2000 ) : @xmath15 days , @xmath16 for the middle planet * c * and @xmath17 days , @xmath18 for the outermost planet * d*. we always started simulations with all three components positioned in the same plane at apoastrons of their orbits and with the two orbits out of phase with each other by @xmath19 ( so we did not use the observed values of @xmath20 ) .",
    "orbital parameters for the @xmath0 and planetary system are not very precisely defined and may vary rather significantly ( particularly the eccentricities ) during the lifetime of the system ( see below ) .",
    "note , however , that differences between values of orbital parameters given by different authors may not be explained by real changes during a short observational time of a few years .",
    "any real and significant changes require a time scale of hundreds years .",
    "in our first set of simulations we use the nominal values of the planetary masses from the lick data : for @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the adopted mass of the star was @xmath24 .",
    "the relative inclination between the two orbital planes was taken to be @xmath25 ( models with higher relative inclinations were also tested but we will discuss those results in our next paper ) . for this set of parameters the system appear to be hierarchically stable over at least @xmath26 years , despite both orbital eccentricities fluctuating almost quasi - periodically within significant ranges : @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "these results are in good qualitive agreement with other simulations ( laughlin & adams 1999 , rivera & lissauer 2000 ) . neither tf or qd or their combination changes notably ( except very minor details ) the orbital evolution of this system .",
    "however , because of the unknown values of the inclination of the orbital planes of the planets @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which can differ very much from each other , even the mass hierarchy of the @xmath0 and planetary system is questionable .",
    "if one accepts the values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 proposed by pourbaix ( 2001 ) with a big uncertainty , this will lead to a very different system with component * c * being no longer a planet ( @xmath33 ) , and @xmath34 ( so the mass hierarchy is now changed ) . in agreement with earlier stability analyses ( stepinski et al .",
    "2000 , rivera & lissauer 2000 ) the new system is highly unstable and disintegrates ejecting the component * d * within the first 1000 years .",
    "the addition of qd increases significantly the lifetime of the system , although it does not change the chaotic and unstable character of its dynamics .    in order to study more systematically the effects of qd and tf ( in this work we study these effect separately ) on dynamical stability of planetary systems unstable in point mass approximation",
    ", we exchanged the masses of planets * c * and * d * in the @xmath0 and system , leaving their intial eccentricities and orbital periods unchanged . without qd and tf",
    "this system is unstable ejecting the less massive ( @xmath35 ) component * d * within @xmath36 years ( top panel of fig .",
    "1 ) . qd and tf may significantly change the dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "the scale of these changes depends very much on the chosen values of coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 from eq 2 .",
    "the value of @xmath37 is defined by the polytropic index @xmath39 of the body ( eq 3 ) .",
    "for the presumably radiative star of @xmath40 we assume @xmath41 with corresponding @xmath42 , and for planets we took @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the dynamics of the system during the first @xmath45 years is significantly less chaotic than without qd and the planet d is not ejected to infinity until @xmath46 years .",
    "but the situation changes really dramatically when we increase the value of @xmath47 to 0.08 ( so assuming a more convective interior of the star ) .",
    "the third panel of fig . 1 show that in this case the system displays hierarchically stable dynamical behaviour over at least @xmath48 years , with quasi - periodic fluctuations of both orbital eccentricities similar to ones of original @xmath0 and system .",
    "the dynamical effect of tidal friction depends on its coefficients @xmath38 .",
    "kiseleva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that for stars similar to the ones in the @xmath49 tau triple system ( fekel & tomkin 1982 ) the most likely @xmath50 .",
    "however , for planets @xmath51 can be significantly larger .",
    "we tested our model with @xmath52 and @xmath53 for all 3 bodies .",
    "the results shown on the two lower panels of fig .",
    "1 are totally different .",
    "@xmath52 does not seem to improve the stability of the system .",
    "however , for @xmath53 the bottom panel presents once more a hierarchically stable system with quasi - periodic behaviour of its orbital parameters such as @xmath54 . dynamical evolution of models with strong qd ( @xmath55 ) and with strong tf ( @xmath53 ) over @xmath48 years look in this case remarkably similar , despite different dynamical properties of these perturbations : tf is a dissipative force with respect to the total orbital energy and qd is conservative .",
    "however , such a similarity does not appear in other cases ( see below ) , and we suspect that over longer time the evolutionary patterns with qd and with tf will diverge .",
    "we also studed models of @xmath0 and with @xmath56 for both external planets * c * and * d * , so the mass hierarchy of the nominal system is preserved and @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "the results are shown on fig.2 .",
    "tf and especially qd significantly increase the lifetime ( upto correspondingly @xmath59 and @xmath60 yrs ) of this unstable system .",
    "our strongest conclusion is that the effects of perturbative forces such as quadrupolar distortion and tidal friction should not be neglected when investigating numerically the dynamical properties of extra - solar planetary systems , especially when their hierarchical stability is questionable and even weak additional forces may change the qualitive character of their dynamics . in our examples",
    "qd always had a stabilizing effect , but we can not claim that it always works this way and more studies are needed .",
    "we did not consider here the contribution of general relativity and intrinsic rotation of the bodies which under some circumstances may be important . in any case , because of problems with the reliable determination of orbital parameters which can not be consider as keplerian in n - body systems , it would be very useful to apply a good dynamical chaos indicator ( lyapunov - type exponent , for example ) , which can distinguish a long - term dynamical instability from relatively short - term integrations , given a good - size sample of possible initial parameters .",
    "one such indicator was suggested recently by cincotta & sim ( 2000 ) .",
    "our first attempts to apply it to extra - solar planetary systems are very encouraging and we are going to discuss the results in our next paper ( godziewski , bois , maciejewski & kiseleva - eggleton , in preparation ) .",
