    "a meaningful test strongly depends on the precision of the measurement data @xmath226 , which should be of relative errors less than @xmath227 .",
    "how to promote the precision of the measurement is the key for the success of a test .    some possible solutions and its implications :    1 .",
    "if @xmath228 and @xmath229 , which means the einstein s mass - energy strictly holds , and the particles can not be described by the classical fields .",
    "if @xmath228 and @xmath230 , this kind of particles has not nonlinear self - interaction , and the balance of the particles should be explained by scalar and vector interactions .",
    "3 .   if @xmath231 , which means the standard model of particles is incomplete , and some calculations in quantum field theory should be modified .    so",
    "no matter what result the experiment provides , the implication is always important and fundamental .",
    "although the standard model of particles has achieved a lot of progresses in explanation of the behavior of micro particles , it is essentially a phenomenology .",
    "so the test of the energy - speed relation might be a shortcut to disclose the secrets of the fundamental particles and their interactions .",
    "we have solved the particle - like eigen solutions to some nonlinear spinor equations , and computed several functions which reflect their characteristics .",
    "the numerical results show that , the nonlinear spinor equations have positive discrete mass spectra and anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the nonlinear potential and interactions yield different contributions to the total energy of the system , which can be used as fingerprints of these terms .",
    "the magnitude of the components can be easily detected by elaborate experiments .",
    "the weird properties of the nonlinear spinors might be closely related with the elementary particles and their interactions , so some deeper investigations on them are significant .",
