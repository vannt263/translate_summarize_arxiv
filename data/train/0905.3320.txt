    "we checked by the several methods that the nir light of the objects is indeed stellar origins and not heavily contaminated by the agn component and the evaluation of the stellar mass based on nir luminosity is not significantly affected by the agn light .",

    "if the star - formation in each galaxy and the mass accretion to its bhs are closely correlated and exactly coeval all the time , there should be more tight correlation between @xmath87 and sfr , while a large uncertain here is how much fraction of the sfr is indeed directly related to the formation of the spheroid component .",
    "as also inferred from fig.8 , the specific agn activity and the specific sfr do not show tight correlation .",

    "( 2008 ) give the consistent results .",
    "we see the observed x - ray luminosities are an order - of - magnitude more luminous than the prediction , which implies that they are due to the agn activities and not seriously contaminated even by the very intense star formation .    in fig.9",
    ", we also show the distribution of the @xmath0-selected as well as the x - ray - identified objects along the color excess values , e(b - v ) and the average age .",
    "we adopted the calzetti law for the dust extinction in the sed fitting .",
    "the x - ray - identified sources are distributed over the parameter plane and no very strong trend is recognized . ages and e(b - v ) values , however , may be degenerate in the sed fitting , which possibly dilutes any intrinsic trends .",
    "there is a hint that the x - ray fraction is slightly high at the middle range of e(b - v ) between 0.3 and 0.6 for the massive galaxies but at the same time we note that the most reddened objects have few x - ray counterparts .",
    "our results in the last section largely owe to the photometric redshift estimation .",
    "although the 40% of the x - ray sources have the secure spectroscopic redshift values and the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshift for the @xmath0-selected galaxies is also reasonable ( kajisawa and yamada 2005 ) , it is worth analyzing the similar sample based on the simple color cut avoiding the uncertainty of the detailed photometric redshift measurements .    for the purpose , we defined the sample of _ distant red galaxies _ ( drgs ) , which have @xmath56 @xmath88 ( franx _ et al .",

    ". while more than a half of the relatively bright drgs with @xmath92 have @xmath93 , the fainter drgs are likely to be dominated by the galaxies at high redshift ( kajisawa _ et al .",
    "this simple color cut is thus useful to make a sample of massive galaxies at @xmath94 . above @xmath95 , the completeness limit of the color selection over gt1-gt4 fields ,",
    "182 drgs are identified .",
    "fig.10 shows the number counts of the whole drgs as well as drgs with the x - ray counterparts .",
    "their color - magnitude distribution is plotted in fig.11 .",
    "the vertical dotted line in fig.10 shows the detection limit for drg , @xmath0=22.8 .",
    "note that the decrease of the number density of drgs is seen at around @xmath0=22 , which is more rapid than that of the entire @xmath0-band selected objects .",
    "this indicates that there are less red low mass galaxies at high redshift ( kajisawa _ et al .",

    "30 - 35% of the drgs ( 19/65 for the hard band , 23/65 for the total band ) are identified with the x - ray sources while it decreases to 21% at @xmath100 .",
    "these analysis for the sample of drgs with the simple color cuts thus support the trend discussed in the previous section , namely , a large x - ray fraction among the bright ( @xmath101 ) or massive objects , and decrease of the x - ray fraction at the fainter magnitude .      among the @xmath32-band selected galaxies at @xmath23 - 4 ,",
    "the x - ray emissions are exclusively associated with the massive objects , with m@xmath7 @xmath102 m@xmath5 . as the _ chandra _ 2m - sec data is deep enough to constrain the presence of moderately - luminous agn even at such high redshift",

    "if we assume the bolometric fraction of the x - ray emission at 2 - 10 kev , @xmath107 and the ratio of the bolometric to the eddington luminosity of the agn , @xmath108 , the observed x - ray luminosity can be connected to the black hole mass by the relationship , @xmath109 @xmath110 .",
    "the absence of luminous agn in the less massive galaxies indicates that the associated bh mass or the activity of the agn is lower than the limit .",
    "unfortunately from the current data we can not discriminate which is the case ; we need further spectroscopic observations to evaluate virial bh mass to break this degeneracy .",
    "instead , we here discuss the two cases with rather extreme assumptions to see which the more natural interpretation is .",
    "we first consider the case that smbh mass does not depend on the host stellar mass , namely similar massive ( or less massive ) bhs exist in massive or less massive host galaxies . in this case , the x - ray non - detection in less massive galaxies below m@xmath7 @xmath111 m@xmath5 is due to the lower activity ( less mass accretion rate ) of their bh .",
    "this is the opposite trend seen for the _ x - ray detected _ sample above @xmath111 m@xmath5 as shown in fig.7 and thus not favorable ; it will be strange that the activity of agn falls off suddenly at @xmath14 m@xmath5 .",
    "we then consider the second case that the m@xmath6/m@xmath12 ratio is constant and does not evolve from the local value , m@xmath6/m@xmath12@xmath112 and not depends on the host stellar mass .",
    "we also assume m@xmath7 @xmath68 m@xmath12 . in this case , the decrease of specific agn activity among the x - ray _ detected _ sample above @xmath14 m@xmath5 shown in fig.7 can be interpreted as the decrease of relative mass accretion rate ; we see that the eddington ratio of smbh in the host with m@xmath113 @xmath114 m@xmath5 ( or the corresponding m@xmath115 @xmath116 m@xmath5 ) is @xmath117 and it becomes lower , @xmath108=0.1 - 0.01 , for the more massive objects . on the other hand ,",
    "few x - ray agn is detected for galaxies with the stellar mass less than 10@xmath16 m@xmath5 ( fig.2 ) , which should host smbh with m@xmath6 @xmath118 m@xmath5 with the assumption above .",
    "this bh mass expected from the no - evolution hypothesis , which may be the upper limit values if we consider the lower spheroidal mass fraction , is comparable with the bh mass detection limit for the current _ chandra _ x - ray data , @xmath119 m@xmath5 and @xmath120 m@xmath5 for @xmath121 at @xmath23 and @xmath122 , respectively , and @xmath123 and @xmath124 m@xmath5 for @xmath125 . thus the latter interpretation seems more natural .",
    "our results are at least consistent with that , at @xmath8 , the galaxies with stellar mass with @xmath14 m@xmath5 or less do not host the black hole which is significantly ( i.e. , more than an order of magnitude ) heavier than that expected from the local relationship , i.e. , m@xmath6@xmath126 m@xmath5 unless the accretion rate is very low , @xmath127 .    mclure _ et al . _",
    "( 2006 ) argue for the sample of 3c rr radio - loud objects that m@xmath6/m@xmath12 ratio is an increasing function with redshift and the ratio is @xmath128 larger at @xmath19 .",
    "these 3c rr galaxies are very massive , m@xmath7 @xmath129 m@xmath5 and their bh mass is estimated to be m@xmath6 @xmath130 m@xmath5 .",
    "if the trend is also true for the galaxies in our sample , the galaxies with m@xmath7 @xmath14 m@xmath5 may have the bh with m@xmath6 @xmath131 m@xmath5 , which is not favored in our results .",
    "the trend that the agn activity seen only among the massive galaxies is very similar with that seen for the local galaxies .",
    "( 2003 ) investigated the host properties of the @xmath132 agns among the @xmath133 galaxies at @xmath134 and found that agn with all luminosity reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies , with m@xmath7@xmath135m@xmath5 .",
    "while we have to consider the x - ray detection limits carefully , the current results are consistent with that agn are observed only among the massive galaxies even at @xmath8 .",
    "on the other hand , a steep number - density evolution of massive galaxies from @xmath98 to @xmath136 is reported ( caputi _ et al .",
    "it is very likely only 10 - 30% of the present - day massive ( @xmath137 m@xmath62 ) galaxies have been formed at @xmath98 and if their progenitors already exist at such high redshift , they may be less massive galaxies which will be merged with other objects or forming more stars to grow .",
    "it is an interesting question whether such progenitors have already hosted the massive bhs which are observed in their present - day descendants or not . in our results , galaxies with smaller mass ( @xmath138 a few @xmath139 m@xmath5 )",
    "do not appear to host the bh as massive as those located in the present - day massive ( @xmath137 m@xmath62 ) galaxies . in this sense , it is unlikely that massive bh had already been formed in the less - massive progenitors of their present - day host galaxies .",
    "we may argue that massive bhs have been developed as the host galaxies have grown their stellar mass , and not significantly prior to that .",
    "it is also surprising that a very large fraction ( @xmath140% ) of the massive galaxies host the _ active _ agn . if the m@xmath6/m@xmath7 ratio for the massive galaxies does not differ from the local value , @xmath112 , many of these agn are active with the eddington ratio @xmath141 as we can see in fig.7 .",
    "while the observed x - ray luminosity and sed - fitting - based sfr are not strongly correlated and the bh formation ( mass accretion ) and the star formation seems not coeval exactly ( fig.8 ) , it can be said that the active duration in the agn duty cycle of the high - redshift massive galaxies is large .",
    "at the same time , we already noted that the negative dependence of the specific agn activity on the stellar mass is observed .",
    "we also investigated how the specific agn activity depends on the averaged stellar age obtained in the sed fitting .",
    "the results are shown in fig.12 .",
    "while they are scattered out and no tight correlation exists , we see a broad trend that the agn activity is high in the young host galaxies with the stellar age less than @xmath142 yr and relatively low in the galaxies which are older than @xmath143 yr ; 8 of 11 galaxies with @xmath144 @xmath145 yr have @xmath146 and 9 of 14 galaxies with @xmath144 @xmath147 yr have @xmath148 .    from these above",
    ", we may infer a possible scenario that the formation of the bhs in massive galaxies continues over the large fraction ( i.e. , @xmath149 ) of the period of their star formation although not instantaneously coeval . in the @xmath0-band - selected very massive ( @xmath150 m@xmath5 ) galaxies at @xmath8 ,",
    "the bh growth is still ongoing but as the star - formation activity peaked earlier in more massive galaxies , as inferred from their relatively older age and lower specific sfr , their agn activities may also be peaked earlier and only relatively lower - level activity is seen at the observed epoch .",
