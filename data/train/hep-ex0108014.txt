    "btev is an experiment expected to run in the new tevatron c0 interaction region at fermilab in @xmath0 2006 .",
    "it is designed to perform precision studies of @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark decays , with particular emphasis on mixing , cp violation , rare and forbidden decays  @xcite .",
    "this experiment takes advantage of two important features of the `` forward '' region : the correlation in the direction of the produced @xmath1 and @xmath3 , that improves the flavor tagging efficiency , and the boost that is exploited in our trigger algorithm based upon the identification of detached charm and beauty decay vertices .",
    "the unique feature of btev is that this algorithm is implemented in the first trigger level  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the vertex detector must have a fast readout , superior pattern recognition power , small track extrapolation errors , and good performance even after high radiation dose .",
    "silicon pixel sensors were chosen because they provide very accurate space point information and have intrinsically low noise and high radiation hardness .    in this paper",
    "we report the results of the 1999 - 2000 btev silicon pixel detector beam test and we compare them to monte carlo predictions .",
    "the beam test was carried out at fermilab in a 227 gev / c pion test beam .",
    "the pixel detectors tested were hybrid assemblies of several combinations of pixel readout chip prototypes developed at fermilab , and single - chip sensor prototypes .",
    "the main goal of our studies was to measure the spatial resolution attainable along the short pixel dimension for different sensor technologies and for different readout electronics configurations .",
    "in particular , we have performed an extensive investigation of the effects of varying the discriminator threshold and the front - end device digitization precision .",
    "the data were collected at the mtest beam line located in the meson area at fermilab .",
    "[ telescope ] shows the experimental set - up .",
    "the pixel devices were located between two stations of silicon microstrip detectors ( ssd s ) that provided tracking information to an accuracy of about 2 @xmath4 m in the @xmath5 direction , corresponding to the `` small pixel dimension '' ( 50 @xmath4 m ) . the pixel hybrid devices were mounted on printed circuits boards , held inside an aluminum box , where their location was determined by precision machined slots .",
    "one of the pixel devices in the telescope could be positioned in slots at various angles with respect to the beam direction .",
    "this enabled us to measure the properties of various pixel prototypes as a function of the pion incident angle .",
    "the pixel detectors tested are all from the `` atlas prototype submission '' @xcite , and all have 50 @xmath4 m @xmath6 400 @xmath4 m pixels .",
    "they use the @xmath7 technology , with the pixel electrodes located on the ohmic side of the device . in order to achieve good inter - pixel insulation ,",
    "two approaches have been tried .",
    "the `` @xmath8-stop '' technique uses @xmath9 implants between the pixel cells , deposited through a mask with the chosen implant geometry , whereas in the `` @xmath8-spray '' technique , pixel implants are deposited after a shallow @xmath9 layer is deposited uniformly throughout the active area .",
    "two of the sensors were produced by cis , germany , and the other three by sii , japan .",
    "[ fpix0and1 ] on the left shows an fpix0 bonded to the cis @xmath8-stop sensor .",
    "the instrumented portion of the sensor is 11 columns @xmath6 64 rows .",
    "the cis sensors ( one @xmath8-stop st1 and one @xmath8-spray st2 ) were indium bump bonded to fpix0 readout chips by boeing north america , inc .",
    "the sii sensors ( two @xmath8-stop st1 s and one @xmath8-spray st2 ) were indium bump bonded to fpix1 readout chips by advanced interconnect technology ltd .",
    "( ait , hong kong ) .",
    "the depletion voltage , measured through the dependence of the leakage current on the reverse bias applied , is 85 v for the cis sensors and 45v for the sii sensors .",
    "the sensor thickness was about 300@xmath4 m .",
    "the front - end device to be coupled to the pixel sensors must satisfy several challenging requirements . in order to obtain the optimal spatial resolution achievable with the chosen pitch , analog information is needed . on the other hand ,",
    "it is necessary to transfer the hit information very quickly to the trigger processor in order to be able to use it in the first trigger level algorithm .",
    "the development effort towards the final chip  @xcite has proceeded along several steps of increasing complexity .",
    "the first iteration , fpix0 , has 12 columns of 64 rows .",
    "each fpix0 readout pixel contains an amplifier , a comparator , and a peak sensing circuit .",
    "when any comparator fires , a fast - or signal is asserted .",
    "fpix0 provides a zero - suppressed readout of hit pixels .",
    "the information read out consists of hit row and column numbers , together with a voltage level which is proportional to the peak pulse height .",
    "for these measurements , the analog output was digitized by an external 8-bit flash adc .",
    "fpix1 is the second - generation pixel readout chip developed at fermilab , and is the first implementation of a high speed readout architecture .",
    "each fpix1 cell includes 4 comparators : one comparator is used to provide sparse readout and the other three implement a 2 bit flash adc for each cell .    two scintillation counters located upstream and downstream of the telescope determined the trigger , through a coincidence with the fast - or signal from the fpix0 @xmath8-stop hybrid detector .",
    "the apparatus was located inside a temperature controlled enclosure , maintained at @xmath10c .",
    "a relative calibration of the adc response of each cell on a readout chip has been performed by injecting charge into individual pixels , sending a voltage pulse to a calibration capacitor in each front - end channel . with this method",
    "the gain and equivalent noise charge are determined up to a scale factor associated with the value of the input capacitor . in order to perform an absolute calibration ,",
    "we have used two x - ray sources ( tb and ag foils excited by an am @xmath11 emitter ) .",
    "the x - rays produce known signals in the sensors and lead to an absolute determination of the electronic gain as well as the equivalent noise charge and discriminator thresholds .    in fig .",
    "[ calfpix0 ] , the pedestal subtracted and gain equalized spectrum of a tb x - ray source measured for an fpix0-instrumented detector is shown . the single channel calibration curve fits the data points very well .",
    "fpix0 contains two different input cells characterized by different gains ( `` high gain '' and `` standard gain '' ) . in the following front - end characterization ,",
    "the quoted central value gives the average quantity and the uncertainty gives the distribution rms within a chip .",
    "for most of the data taking , the discriminator threshold for the fpix0 @xmath8-stop was set to a voltage equivalent to 2500@xmath12400 e@xmath13 for the standard gain cells , and 1500@xmath12230 e@xmath13 for the high gain cells . for the fpix0 @xmath8-spray",
    "device the corresponding thresholds were typically 2200@xmath12350 e@xmath13 and 1250@xmath12160 e@xmath13 .",
    "the equivalent noise charge is 105@xmath1215 e@xmath13 for standard gain cells , and 83@xmath1215 e@xmath13 for for high gain cells of the fpix0 @xmath8-stop hybrid pixel devices .",
    "the corresponding values for the fpix0 @xmath8-spray devices are 80@xmath1210 e@xmath13 for standard gain cells , and 67@xmath128 e@xmath13 for high gain cells .",
    "an additional contribution due to the external buffer amplifier and adc of about 400@xmath12150 e@xmath13 for fpix0 standard gain cells and 205@xmath1295 e@xmath13 for fpix0 high gain cells was present .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "the discriminator threshold is one of the front - end electronics parameters that has considerable influence on the spatial resolution .",
    "[ resth ] ( top ) shows the predicted effect of increasing the threshold for an incident angle @xmath14 of 300 mrad , for analog and digital readout .",
    "the bottom plot shows the fraction of events having @xmath15 pixels hit for a given threshold .",
    "for instance , for a threshold of 2000 electrons , about 50% of the events have 3 pixels hit , and about 50% have 2 pixels hit . as the digital clustering algorithm exploits the information provided by the number of pixels in a cluster , its accuracy is best when there is an almost equal population in two different cluster sizes : one cluster size corresponding to a track incident close to the pixel center and the other corresponding to incidence close to the boundary between two pixels . in the analog readout case ,",
    "the accuracy of any position reconstruction algorithm is degraded as the threshold increases .",
    "note that at increasing thresholds the efficiency becomes smaller , as illustrated by the curve n=0 , corresponding to no pixel firing because all the charge signals are below threshold .",
    "[ resth_meas ] shows the corresponding measured data points for fpix0 hybrid detectors .",
    "the effective depletion depth of the detector can be measured from data at large track angle .",
    "we used two different methods .",
    "the first method has been originally proposed by atlas@xcite to measure the effective depletion depth of irradiated and non - irradiated sensors .",
    "it consists of a track - pixel position correlation estimator , where for each pixel over threshold whose center is at position x@xmath16 the distance z@xmath16 between the track and the backplane is calculated with the formula : @xmath17 , where x@xmath18 is the x coordinate of the entrance point extrapolated by the fitted track and @xmath19 is the track incidence angle .",
    "the z@xmath16 distribution is flat between approximate 0 and the effective depletion depth .",
    "the locations of rising and falling edges vary with different electronic thresholds . in order to estimate the depletion depth , a detailed mc simulation is needed .",
    "the second method consists of a length - charge correlation estimator using the pixel charge within a cluster . for clusters including @xmath20 pixels",
    ", we can estimate an effective depletion depth @xmath21 , where q@xmath22 is the charge collected by the pixel at the left ( right ) edge , q@xmath23 is the sum of the charge collected by the @xmath24 middle pixels , and @xmath8 is the pitch along @xmath5 . the distribution of the estimator z@xmath25 is peaked around the effective depletion depth .",
    "[ effectivedepth ] shows the data and mc simulation for the cis @xmath8-stop - fpix0 hybrid detector .",
    "using @xmath26 , the effective depth is found to be @xmath27 m and @xmath28 m for the two methods respectively .",
    "the difference between two methods ( @xmath29 m ) can be used as an estimate of the uncertainties in the two methods . note that this error corresponds to about 1@xmath30 uncertainty in the track incident angle .",
    "so the depletion depth is @xmath31 m .",
    "a small fraction of events have clusters with a number of hits greater than expected , given only the track trajectory and diffusion .",
    "[ multiplicity ] shows the measured frequency of high - multiplicity clusters for tracks at normal incidence .",
    "our monte carlo simulation , which includes energetic @xmath32-rays , reproduces the measured cluster multiplicity reasonably well .",
    "the pixel residual distribution ( or resolution function ) deviates from a gaussian in two ways : the first effect is produced by the non - optimal the charge sharing at almost normal incidence that produces a large fraction of 1 pixel clusters ; the second is related to large cluster size events due to delta - ray emission .",
    "these effects have been alluded to before and are now discussed quantitatively using a sample of tracks at nominal normal incidence .    fig .",
    "[ boxandtail ] shows the residual distributions for the fpix0 @xmath8-spray detector taken with the beam nominally at normal incidence .",
    "the plot on the left shows the residual for one - pixel clusters .",
    "the plot on the right shows the residual for clusters of two or more pixels , with a fit with the function @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a gaussian , and @xmath36 is defined as : @xmath37 @xmath38 is a normalization constant , @xmath39 is the half width of the constant term , and @xmath40 is the exponent of the power - law dependence .",
    "the non - gaussian fraction @xmath41 accounts for 18% of the total number of entries in the distribution .",
    "the naive expectation of a rectangular shape 50 @xmath4 m for the residual distribution for one pixel clusters is distorted by two effects .",
    "the population at the `` edges '' of the rectangle is depleted by diffusion , inducing two pixel clusters for track incident near the pixel periphery . on the other hand ,",
    "a broadening of this ideal distribution is induced by threshold dispersion and electronic noise , as well as the small fraction of mismeasured extrapolated position @xmath42 .    the second factor that makes the pixel residual distributions",
    "non - gaussian is @xmath32-ray emission .",
    "low energy @xmath32-rays which stop in one of the pixels crossed by the particle skew the charge sharing and degrade the resolution .",
    "higher energy @xmath32-rays cross one or more pixel boundaries and distort the position measurement even more . we have studied this effect with the monte carlo simulation described before .",
    "[ deltaray ] shows a comparison between predictions and data .",
    "the distributions are shown using a log scale to show the tails of the residual distribution more clearly .",
    "the simulation accounts for about 1/2 of the broad component of the residual distribution",
    ". this may be in part due to instrumental effects such as the charge losses near the pixel boundaries of the @xmath8-spray devices .",
    "charge - sharing between columns occurs for less than @xmath43 of the tracks in our data sample .",
    "we collected enough data to study this effect only at 0@xmath30 , where the diffusion is the basic sharing mechanism .",
    "for @xmath8-stop sensors the effective charge sharing region is a rectangular ring with approximately uniform thickness along the pixel boundary .",
    "[ sharingcol ] shows the residual distributions @xmath44 and @xmath45 of 1 row and 2 column clusters .",
    "the measured @xmath46 is calculated with the procedure described before , using a linear eta correction determined from the data .",
    "the spatial resolution along @xmath47 is consistent with the @xmath5 resolution when charge sharing allows for interpolation between the pixel centers .",
    "an extensive test beam study of several hybrid pixel detectors has demonstrated that both the sensors and the front - end electronics chosen for btev perform according to expectations .",
    "the charge collection properties of the sensors studied are well understood .",
    "we have shown that 2-bit analog information is satisfactory and , consequently , that the final version of the front - end electronics , featuring a 3-bit flash adc will provide the excellent spatial resolution needed to achieve the btev physics goals .",
    "we would like to thank fermilab for providing us with the dedicated beam time for our test and the excellent infrastructure support .",
    "we are grateful to the atlas collaboration , with special thanks to their pixel group for the sensors that were used in this test and many useful discussions .",
    "we are indebted to colin gay for the data acquisition software .",
    "we also thank the us national science foundation and the department of energy for support .",
