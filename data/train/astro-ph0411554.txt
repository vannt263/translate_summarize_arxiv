    "the location of the wind seen to be outflowing from at least half of all active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in x - ray and uv spectra ( crenshaw , kraemer and george 2003 ) is a matter of importance to understanding the structure of these objects , but is currently a matter of great debate .",
    "if the wind originates from the accretion disk , widely thought to be the origin of the agn continuum , then all the emission and absorption features in agn spectra , including the broad emission lines ( bels ) , could arise from this wind ( elvis 2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "if instead the wind arises from the inner edge of the obscuring torus ( krolik & kriss 2001 ) then several disconnected gaseous components are present in agns , and the mass flux in the wind is large ( netzer et al .",
    "2003 , behar et al .",
    "2003 , ogle et al .",
    "2004 ) . a large scale wind , with a continuous radial decrease in ionization parameter ( kinkhabwala et al . 2002 ) would tie together type 1 and type 2 agns , as high ionization kpc scale ` cones ' are seen around several type 2 agns in chandra images ( sako et al .",
    "2000 ; young et al . 2001 ; brinkman et al .",
    "2002 ; ogle et al .",
    "2003 ) , and these would produce high ionization absorbers if viewed along the cone axis toward the nucleus .",
    "these are quite different views of the same observations .",
    "variability of the x - ray absorption features can provide a direct test of these models , as rapid variability requires clumped gas , while in continuous radial structures of ionization parameters the variability effects should be washed out by the average absorption in the flow .",
    "variability of the features can also shed light on the location of the absorber .",
    "studies of x - ray absorber variability in agns have been undertaken for a decade or so .",
    "ptak et al .",
    "( 1994 ) reported spectral variability in an asca observation of ngc 3227 , which could be explained by opacity changes of ionized gas .",
    "however , this would require a decrease in ionization state and column density of the absorber , as the luminosity of the central source increased . on the other hand , the data was also consistent with the variability being due to changes in the intrinsic shape of the emitted continuum , with little change in the opacity of the absorber .",
    "something similar was found in two asca observations of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( reynolds 1995 ) : the ionization parameter and column density of the absorber were higher when the flux was lower . using a third asca observation , of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , otani et al .",
    "( 1996 ) observed variability in the depth of the o viii edge , but no apparent change in the depth of the o vii edge .",
    "this led the authors to suggest that two different regions were responsible for the absorption , and using equilibration timescale arguments the authors were able to constrain the location of the absorbing gas . in a rosat observation of ngc 4051 , mchardy et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , reported opacity changes in the absorber that did not track linearly the changes in luminosity .",
    "more recently , and using more comprehensive models , nicastro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , and netzer et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have also shown variability in the opacity of the absorber , locating the gas close to the broad emission line region .",
    "the results from these early papers , based on low resolution x - ray spectra , suggest variations .",
    "however these variations are hard to interpret since high resolution x - ray spectra from chandra and xmm - newton now show that the absorbers are far more complex than the simple models used in those papers .",
    "the high resolution x - ray spectra though , typically have insufficient signal - to - noise to subdivide in time bins .    a rare exception is the integrated 900ks exposure on ngc  3783 with the chandra gratings .",
    "ngc 3783 ( z=0.00976@xmath5 from stellar absorption features , de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) is one of the best studied seyfert 1 galaxies in the uv and x - ray bands , showing prominent absorption features arising from ionized gas ( e.g. kaspi et al .",
    "2002 , blustin et al .",
    "2002 for the x - rays and kraemer et al .",
    "2001 , gabel et al 2003 for the uv ) .",
    "the compiled spectrum has given new insights on the nuclear environment of agns .",
    "there is evidence in x - rays for absorption at radial velocities consistent with those observed in the uv , which strongly suggests a common nature for the outflow .",
    "recent results by krongold et al .",
    "( 2003 , k03 hereafter ) have shown that most of the features observed in absorption ( more than 100 lines and blends ) can be reproduced by a simple model with two components , and that these turned out to be in pressure equilibrium .",
    "this result was confirmed by netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who found a third component also in pressure balance with the other two .",
    "this third component accounts for very highly ionized features , primarily fe ( xxiii - xxvi ) .",
    "in this paper , we present an analysis of the variability in the opacity of the absorbers in ngc 3783 . by binning up the data into channels of size 0.25   ( r@xmath6 )",
    "we demonstrate variability in the opacity of the uta at a significance @xmath1 .",
    "ngc 3783 was observed six times using the hetgs ( canizares et al . 2000 ) on board the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory ( weisskopf et al . 2000 ) , with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis , garmire et al . 2003 ) . the first 56 ks observation ( obsid 373 )",
    "was carried out on january 2000 .",
    "the following five 170 ks observations were taken in the four months between february and june of 2001 ( see kaspi et al .",
    "2002 , k03 ) . in this paper",
    "we focus on the spectra obtained by the medium energy grating ( meg , 5 - 25  ) .    to study the temporal variability of the absorber , we proceeded in the following way : the first two observations ( obsids 2090 and 2091 ) are separated by only 3 days and have extremely similar count rates ( 0.38 cts s@xmath7 , 5 - 25  ) , but lower fluxes than the rest of the observations ( see netzer et al .",
    "2003 for detailed light curves ) .",
    "then , we coadded these two observations to obtain a low state spectrum ( hereafter ls ) .",
    "the observation with the highest count rate ( obsid 2093 ; 0.74 cts s@xmath7 i.e. , twice the count rate of the ls ) began @xmath831 days after the end of the ls observation",
    ". we will refer to this observation as the `` high state '' ( hereafter hs ) .",
    "our reason for choosing this grouping is that there is a difference of 16% in count rate between the ls with respect to obsid 2092 ( 0.44 cts s@xmath7 ) , and 33% with respect to obsid 2094 ( 0.51 cts s@xmath7 ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown by netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , there is a rapid variability of the soft excess in the spectrum of ngc 3783 . since the spectra from obsids 2092 and 2094 is also softer , the difference in flux between these observations and the ls at larger wavelengths ( @xmath9  ) , where many of the ionization potentials for the relevant inner shell lines are observed ( including the fe m - shell edges responsible for the uta ) , may be larger . thus , although coadding all these observations together would increase the s / n of the low state , it could also wash out the opacity differences with respect to the hs .",
    "the count rate in obsid 373 ( 0.60 cts s@xmath7 ) is 20% smaller than in obsid 2093 .",
    "in addition , the time separation between these observations ( 1.2 years ) might introduce long term variability on the absorber because of reasons different than flux variations ( e.g. column density variations etc . ) .",
    "the grouping presented here represents the best configuration to avoid these effects .",
    "this grouping differs from the grouping applied to the data by netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who considered obsid observations 2090 , 2091 , 2092 , and 2094 as the low state and obisd observations 373 and 2093 as the high state .",
    "the 5 - 25   observed flux of the ls is @xmath10 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 ( luminosity of @xmath12 erg s@xmath7 ) , and that of the hs is @xmath13 erg @xmath11 s@xmath7 ( luminosity of @xmath14 erg s@xmath7 ) .",
    "in figure [ spectra]a we present a comparison of the ls and hs spectra between 15 and 18  , the region of the uta .",
    "the data has been grouped in bins of size 0.25   to increase the s / n ratio of the spectra .",
    "although such binning washes out the signature of isolated narrow absorption lines , it is better for the study variability in broad blended features , such as the uta .",
    "the ls has been scaled by a factor 3.0 to match the flux level of the high state .",
    "this is the same scaling factor applied to the data by netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , but we note that the results presented here are not sensitive to this factor",
    ". there is a clear shift of @xmath15   in the position of the uta toward shorter wavelengths in the hs compared to the ls .",
    "this shift is highly statistically significant and is far larger than wavelength calibration uncertainties .",
    "the change can only be attributed to a physical change in the absorber .    to compare the observed opacity variation with theoretical predictions from photoionization models ,",
    "we have generated hs and a ls absorption models with the code phase ( k03 ) .",
    "we used the best ( 5 - 25  ) fitting model for the low ionization component from k03 ( presented in table [ 2ab ] ) as an `` average state '' of the gas producing the uta , as k03 analysis was based on the averaged spectrum of the six observations . since the count rate from the ls to the hs changed by a factor @xmath0 , we have selected values for the ionization parameter u of the high and low states also separated by a factor of 2 . we have used the equivalent h column density , and the turbulent and outflow velocities of the absorber as those derived by k03 ( table [ 2ab ] ) .",
    "figure [ spectra]b presents a comparison of these high and low ionization models .",
    "there is a striking similarity between the changes observed in the spectra and the changes predicted by the models . in particular , the spectra clearly shows that the shape of the uta ( along with the o vii k edge located at @xmath16  , a feature heavily blended with the uta ) is varying as expected for gas close to photoionization equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the o vi k edge located at @xmath17   also appears to be varying as predicted by the model .    in panel ( c ) of figure [ spectra ]",
    "the ratio between the observed hs and ls spectra is presented .",
    "the errors in this figure have been calculated in quadrature from the errors in each spectrum .",
    "the variation in the ratio is again highly significant , at a level @xmath1 for the uta , and @xmath2 for the o vi edge .",
    "figure [ spectra]d , shows the ratio between the high state and low state models , and for clarity we have applied the same binning factor used for the data .",
    "both panels show striking similarities .",
    "we conclude that the low ionization phase ( hereafter lip , k03 ) responsible for the absorption by the uta is responding to the ionization continuum and is possibly in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , the fe - l shell absorption , identified by k03 as the high ionization phase ( hereafter hip , see table [ 2ab ] ) , and responsible for most of the bound bound absorption features , does not respond linearly to the changes in the ionizing flux , as the variations that should be present in the hs and ls spectra are not observed . this can be seen in the region between 8 and 13   ( see fig . [ hip ] ) , where the fe l - shell opacity should have varied significantly .    finally , we note that the results reported in this letter are consistent with figure 9 by netzer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , where they present the ratio between their choice of high and low spectra in bins of 0.1   in size .",
    "the observed variability of the uta helps in understanding the structure of ionized absorbers in agn .",
    "a popular model for the structure is that of a continuous range of ionization structures spanning a large location in the nuclear environment ( rather than a localized absorber ) , and spanning more than two orders of magnitude in ionization parameter ( e.g. ogle et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "in such a model many ions of the same element have comparable column densities .",
    "thus no variability is expected in the opacity of the absorber with moderate flux variations ( by a factor @xmath18 ) , because the average column density of each ion remains constant in the flow .",
    "this is because the amount of material in the line of sight changing from charge state _ i _ to charge state _",
    "i+1 _ , as the result of a continuum variation , is almost equally replaced by the amount of material transformed into charge state _",
    "i _ from charge state _",
    "i-1_. thus variation is only expected at the boundaries of the flow . in this case",
    "the observed uta represents the `` averaged absorption '' from the dominant fe charge states in all shells ( netzer 2004 ) and will remain constant to moderate continuum variations .",
    "the observed variation of the uta rules then out a continuous radial range of ionization stages , and implies that the absorbing gas is highly clumped .",
    "the change in the opacity of ionized plasma depends not only on the change of flux , but also on the change in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the central continuum source .",
    "this should be kept in mind because there is a larger change in the soft x - ray region of the spectra than in the hard region between the ls and hs observations ( netzer et al .",
    "however , the meg data does not allow us to measure spectral variations beyond 25  , which is the most critical part of the spectrum for the ionization state of the lip .",
    "this means that the soft excess might extend up to the lyman limit ( as assumed by netzer et al .",
    "2004 ) , or might rather be a localized feature , fading out at relatively large energies ( i.e. e@xmath19 kev ) , as suggested by recent studies ( haro - corzo et al .",
    "2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "evidently these two possibilities of sed would produce dramatically different effects on the opacity of the ionized gas .",
    "additional complexity is added because at least part of the changes observed in the soft band are not intrinsic to the continuum source , but produced by the change in opacity of the absorber .",
    "all these effects make an exact determination of the expected variation of the gas in photoionization equilibrium impossible to achieve .",
    "such determination would require a self consistent global model , over time resolved broad band data .",
    "however , we stress again , that the change in the shape of the uta is consistent with a change in ionization parameter by a factor of 2 .",
    "since the observed total flux changed also by this factor , there is support for a scenario where the lip is close to photoionization equilibrium .",
    "assuming photoionization equilibrium applies , and using the temperature and ionization parameter deduced from the k03 model ( table [ 2ab ] ) , and the recombination times from the leading charge states of fe producing the uta ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ) , we can set limits on the density and location of the absorber . considering the elapsed time between the ls and hs ( @xmath8 31 days ) as an upper limit for the destruction ( or equilibration ) timescale of a single ion ( see krolik and kriss 1995 and nicastro et al .",
    "1999 ) we find n@xmath20 @xmath4 and d@xmath21 pc .",
    "behar et al . ( 2003 ) reported a slight shift in the position of the uta in ngc 3783 during a change of flux by a factor of 2 in a timescale @xmath22 days , but rejected photoionization equilibrium arguing that the change in the position of the uta would have had to be 0.4   with such change in flux .",
    "however , this calculation considers only the change in opacity for fe . including absorption from all the ions in the lip reduces the expected difference to 0.2  , because of the presence of bound - free transitions ( particularly the o vii and o vi k edges , see fig .",
    "[ spectra]b ) .",
    "therefore , the variation observed by behar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) might still be consistent with photoionization equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the s / n ratio of their low and high state data might not be enough to detect such variation in a significant way .",
    "deciding this is beyond the scope of the present paper , however we note the following : ( 1 ) if the xmm s / n ratio is indeed sufficient to detect the expected opacity variation , and this variation is not observed , then the gas should be located between 5.7 and 1.3 pc from the central source excluding the broad line region , as suggested by behar et al .",
    "( 2 ) if the expected variation is detected , the gas should be closer than 1.3 pc .",
    "( 3 ) if the s / n ratio is not sufficient to detect the expected opacity variation , then the gas can lie anywhere within 5.7 pc .    in these last two cases",
    "the location of the absorber could thus , well be at subparsec scales , as suggested by reeves et al .",
    "( 2004 , distance @xmath23 0.1 pc ) for fe k - shell ( the third and hottest absorption component in ngc 3783 ) .",
    "this is also consistent with measurements for ionized absorbers in other objects , which suggest that the location of the absorber might be similar to that of the broad emission line region , e.g. ngc 4051 ( nicastro et al .",
    "1999 ) , ngc 3516 ( netzer et al .",
    "2002 ) , and ngc 7469 ( kriss et al .",
    "2003 , blustin et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in any case , the detected variability presented here rules out the presence of an absorber extending tens or hundreds of parsecs outside the nucleus ( and a continuous range of ionization stages , see  [ struc ] ) , and rather suggests a localized absorber , as has also been suggested by the evidence of transverse motion of the absorbing gas with respect to our line of sight in several objects ( see crenshaw , kraemer and george 2003 , and references therein ) . given these properties ,",
    "it is clear that the absorber ( at least the lip ) in the nuclear environment of ngc 3783 is very different from the extended x - ray emission gas observed is seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "it is important to note that the uta sets tight constraints in the ionization state of the absorber ( k03 ) because ( 1 ) this feature is strongly dependent on the charge states of fe producing it , since several charge states of the same element are observed at the same time , and ( 2 ) because it is a broad feature , and therefore its detection involves a large number of detector channels which allows for a heavy binning of the spectra to consider large number of counts ( see also behar et al .",
    "we stress , then , that the observed change in the position of the uta is a highly robust measurement of the opacity variation in the ionized absorber in ngc 3783 .",
    "in contrast to the lip , the hip does not vary as expected in photoionization equilibrium .",
    "however , since there are no very broad features in this component ( like for instance the uta in the lip ) , and many features are composed by several blends of very different charge states from different elements , it is not even clear whether this component is changing as a whole or not , or even to establish if the ionization state is increasing or decreasing .",
    "such behavior might have several explanations : ( 1 ) this component may have such a low density , that the timescale for the gas to reach photoionization equilibrium might be larger than the variability timescale of ngc 3783 .",
    "in this situation the gas would be out of equilibrium , and , rather than changing as a whole , each element would vary according to the recombination timescales of its dominant charge states .",
    "since this timescale varies from ion to ion and element to element , the opacity of the gas would not change as a whole , but rather some elements might seem to get more ionized , while other may seem to decrease in state of ionization ( see nicastro et al .",
    "this would imply n@xmath24 @xmath4 and d@xmath250.6 pc ( netzer et al .",
    "( 2 ) the second possibility is that the opacity is varying very little because the gas lies in the intermediate stable branch of the thermal equilibrium t vs. u / t curve ( or s - curve ) .",
    "the length of this branch strongly depends on the metallicity of the gas , and while it can be small for solar metallicity , it can be much more extended for values 3 times solar ( see komossa and fink 1997 ) .",
    "even the 900 ks exposure of ngc 3783 is insensitive to deviations by these factors in metallicity ( k03 ) .",
    "therefore , if the metallicity of this component is close to solar , the hip might not be changing simply because it is confined to the intermediate stable branch of the thermal equilibrium curve ( k03 ) .",
    "( 3 ) finally , it is also possible that the opacity is not changing as expected because the gas is pressure confined ( in this case by a third hotter component , as suggested by netzer et al .",
    "2003 ) . as has been amply discussed by krongold et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , in a case of a 3-phase confined medium , the confined components have to follow the confining medium on the thermal equilibrium curve .",
    "in such a scenario , while the variation of the lip is expected to be similar to the one observed in photoionization equilibrium , because of the shape of the s - curve , the variability of the hip might be completely different , even decreasing in ionization while the flux increases ( see krongold et al .",
    "2004 for a full explanation ) . in this case",
    "this gas must , of course , share the same physical location as the lip and of the third , hottest component .",
    "deciding among these possibilities would require more data , and models including time evolving photoionization effects .",
    "using the 900 ks _ chandra _ hetgs spectrum of ngc 3783 , we unambiguously ( @xmath26 ) detect opacity variations in the fe m - shell unresolved transition array ( uta ) , in response to an ionizing continuum change by a factor of 2 .",
    "the uta is the best diagnostic for detecting opacity changes in ionized plasma .",
    "the changes are as expected for gas close to photoionization equilibrium implying a density n@xmath27 @xmath4 .",
    "this result locates the absorbing material within 6 pc of the central source and are consistent with estimates by reeves et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for another absorbing component .",
    "the strong change in ionization state rules out a picture where the absorber extends radially in a continuous flow over hundreds of parsecs , implying that this gas is different than the one observed in emission in seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the observations also imply that the gas is heavily clumped , since in a continuous distribution of ionization stages no variability is expected with moderate flux variations .",
