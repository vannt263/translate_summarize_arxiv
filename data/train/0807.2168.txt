    "the kinetics of thermoelastic martensitic transitions ( mt ) is a challenging problem to which physicists and material scientists have devoted several decades of study .",
    "the complexity of the phenomenon arises from three main factors : ( i ) firstly , the first - order character of the transition which , in many cases , implies the existence of high - energy barriers and associated long - lived metastable states . the word `` athermal '' has been used to refer to those mt where thermal fluctuations do not play any role , and thus only evolve through states when metastability limits are reached .",
    "this , combined with the existence of disorder in the systems , leads to history dependence and avalanche dynamics .",
    "( ii ) the second important factor is the non - trivial relation between the symmetries of the parent and product phases , especially in real 3d systems .",
    "the product phase may appear in a number of energetically equivalent variants which have the tendency to satisfy some `` matching '' conditions between each other and the parent phase .",
    "( iii ) the third contribution to the complexity of the phenomenon is the existence of long - range correlations due to the elastic nature of the problem .",
    "the effects of nucleation of a martensite domain in a certain point of the system may influence the kinetics of the transition at a large distance from this point .",
    "the final microstructures observed in the martensitic phase are a consequence of the complex interplay of these three factors ( i - iii ) , and thus if one wants to have a full understanding of the phenomenon , it is not enough to reduce it to the problem of the optimization of a certain hamiltonian . in order to understand this point of view , it is instructive to compare real microstructures observed over a large sample ( see , for instance fig.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite and fig.4 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) with the perfect patterns calculated from elasticity theories ( see , for instance ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "the definition of `` kinetic constraint '' in much simpler models has been introduced @xcite to account for the fact that some low - energy states can not be obtained due to the absence of a possible pathway .",
    "current theories are still far from being able to predict martensitic microstructures .",
    "details such as sample size and shape , defects , annealing times , quenching rates , etc . , are known to dramatically change the final state of the martensite ( similarly to what happens for the domain structure of magnetic materials @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , it has been known for centuries that to obtain a `` good '' microstructure in a metallic alloy is an `` art '' reserved for the best smiths or metallurgists .",
    "quantitative experimental information concerning the growth of the microstructure in martensitic transitions is difficult to be obtained @xcite .",
    "this is because most observation techniques , both direct imaging or scattering techniques ( x - rays , neutrons and electrons microscopy ) , can not be easily performed `` in situ '' during the transition .",
    "one must stop the transition in an intermediate state by quenching and perform a posterior sample treatment for the observation .",
    "furthermore , in the case of direct imaging techniques it is difficult to extract numerical data from sequences of 2d micrographs of the system surface .",
    "there have been some `` in situ ''",
    "synchrotron radiation experiments @xcite that follow the growth of peaks associated with martensitic structures , but the studies have mostly concentrated on understanding the precursor effects before the real transition starts .",
    "some interesting phenomena have been reported during the transition . in some cases",
    "the formation of intermediate `` phases '' with only short - range order and with reciprocal space vectors , different from the final position of the martensitic peak structure have been observed @xcite .",
    "in addition , a recent work has quantified the fact that microstructures exhibit imperfect self - accommodation due to the coalescence of the variants @xcite .    among the theoretical efforts to understand microstructure formation",
    ", one should mention many continuum models , derived from elasticity theory @xcite . despite advances in computing power , the complexity of the models ( especially the long - range character of the interactions ) is such that it is difficult to perform a large number of simulations and a statistical analysis of microstructures . in many cases the models have only been applied to 2d unrealistic crystals , while in others the number of coexisting variants has been reduced artificially or by considering a symmetry breaking external stress .    in this work",
    "we will focus on the cubic to tetragonal mt .",
    "this kind of transition occurs , for instance , in a number of binary metallic alloys for different ranges of concentrations . among others",
    "@xcite we recall intl , inpb , nial , fept and fepd @xcite .",
    "different microstructures have been observed in these transitions .",
    "a common basic feature is the clear tendency for the variants to grow forming twins .",
    "these are domains of different variants that share a common interface oriented in a certain preferred direction . by this mechanism ,",
    "elastic distortions of the lattice are minimized . for the cubic to tetragonal transition of interest here , the twin boundaries are planes perpendicular to the ( 110 ) direction ( or any of the 6 equivalent ones ) of the cubic phase .",
    "the overall microstructures , nevertheless , are a combination of the different twins and usually look quite random .    in a previous paper",
    "we introduced a random field potts model with truncated dipolar interaction for `` athermal '' first - order phase transitions between phases with any change of symmetry @xcite .",
    "the model was based on the @xmath0 rfim with metastable dynamics , which was originally proposed for the study of field induced athermal transitions between two ferromagnetic symmetrically equivalent phases .",
    "the proposed modifications allowed , for instance , the following to be studied : transitions from a non - degenerate phase to a phase with three different variants , the influence of the amount of disorder on the dynamics and how the parameters of the dipolar interaction term affect the final microstructure .    in the present study we are going to go one step forward .",
    "we will adapt the model to the symmetries of a cubic to tetragonal mt .",
    "we will extend the range of the dipolar interaction in order to obtain the twin microstructures observed in such a mt transition .",
    "we have found that it is enough to include up to 4th nearest neighbors . by truncating long - range interactions",
    "we accelerate our simulations , so that we can perform a systematic study of the hamiltonian parameters and statistics over disorder configurations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we introduce the hamiltonian of our model , and discuss the truncation of the dipolar term .",
    "we also give details about the dynamics and the simulations . in sec.[groundstate ] we present a ground state analysis of the martensitic microstructures that optimize the energy .",
    "this will help us in choosing the interesting range of hamiltonian parameters . in sec .",
    "[ simmicro ] we present some of the microstructures obtained by dynamically driving the system from the parent to the fully saturated martensitic phase .",
    "the results are compared with the previous ground - state configurations . in sec.[isteresi ] we discuss the shape of the hysteresis cycles and the effect of varying the hamiltonian parameters ( disorder and dipolar intensity ) and the sample size .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the microstructures is presented in sec.[real_space_analysis ] and [ fourier_analysis ] , were we show the system evolution along the hysteresis cycle in real and fourier space , respectively . finally in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we both summarize and conclude .",
    "let us consider a simple cubic lattice of size @xmath1 , with lattice parameter @xmath2 and periodic boundary conditions . at each lattice site",
    "we define a variable which can take four different values that we will call @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . as in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we have chosen to represent our variables by considering a vector @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , having three components : we will indicate the four possible values as @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . these variables can be interpreted as an elementary domain in the cubic austenite phase ( vector @xmath3 ) , or in the three possible variants of a tetragonal martensitic phase ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) .",
    "the interaction between the variants can be described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath13    the first contribution in the hamiltonian is a potts exchange term between nearest neighbors ( nn ) which accounts for the bulk energy favoring the growth of single phase domains .",
    "the second is the long - range dipolar interaction .",
    "the absolute value taken in the dipolar term guarantees the rotational invariance that is expected in the systems that we want to model .",
    "the third hamiltonian term represents the interaction between the external driving field @xmath14 and the order parameter @xmath15 .",
    "note that the vector @xmath3 , corresponding to an elementary domain in the austenite phase , has absolute value zero and thus does not contribute to @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "all the three variants of the martensitic phase are here represented by vectors with modulus one .",
    "consequently , @xmath17 can be read as the normalized transformed fraction of the sample .",
    "thus , the field @xmath14 drives the system from the cubic phase @xmath18 ( when @xmath19 ) to a multi - variant tetragonal phase with @xmath20 ( when @xmath21 ) .",
    "it therefore plays the role of the temperature for such an `` athermal '' phase transition .    the last term of the hamiltonian accounts for the interaction with the quenched disorder ( impurities , dislocations , vacancies , etc . ) , which is always present in real materials .",
    "its precise form will be discussed later on in this section .    as explained in the introduction , a first version of this model considered only nearest - neighbor dipolar interactions @xcite .",
    "this produced anisotropic domains of the different variants , but not the correct microstructures observed in mt . in the present work we will introduce higher order dipolar interactions .",
    "as will be seen , it is enough to include the interaction between fourth nearest neighbors ( 4n ) , at a distance @xmath22 from the reference elementary domain ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it will be the interplay between the interactions to nn and to 4n ( which are placed along the same spatial direction ) that generates the convenient microstructures , in a way similar to what happens in the annni model @xcite .",
    "although we have also studied the second and third nearest - neighbors interactions , we have found out that these terms are not crucial for the microstructure formation and do not add any new physics .",
    "therefore , for simplicity in most of the paper they have been neglected , except where indicated otherwise . moreover , we have allowed the coefficients @xmath23 that control the decay of the dipolar interaction to have more freedom . since we are truncating and including only two terms",
    ", there is no need to keep the coefficients as in the original model .",
    "we have considered two general parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 multiplying the dipolar interaction to nn and to 4n nearest - neighbors .",
    "thus , after these modification , our hamiltonian reads : @xmath26 where the second sum runs over nn and the third only over the fourth nearest - neighbors .",
    "the interaction with quenched disorder has also been simplified from what was originally proposed in ref .  . here ,",
    "in fact , we will not focus on the study of the influence of disorder , but we need a certain amount of it in order to favor nucleation of the martensitic phase in all the equivalent variants .",
    "thus we have considered : @xmath27 where the quenched random fields @xmath28 are independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables , with zero mean and unitary variance .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 models the strength of the disorder . note that after the simplifications , the hamiltonian parameters are only three : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath29 .    for the study of athermal behavior , apart from the hamiltonian , one must choose a certain dynamics .",
    "we chose to implement the extremal update dynamics @xcite : starting from a saturated system configuration , corresponding to @xmath18 at @xmath19 , we increase ( decrease ) the field by small steps @xmath30 . at each field step",
    "we check the contribution to the energy of each @xmath31 .",
    "when a variable is found to decrease the total energy by varying to a new state , we change it to the value that gives the most negative energy change . in this way we guarantee that the system will reach the same state for the same applied field values , independently of the @xmath32 value .",
    "the states reached are equivalent both macroscopically ( same transformed fraction @xmath33 ) and microscopically ( same values of @xmath34 for all the @xmath35 values ) .",
    "the simulations presented below were obtained by choosing @xmath36 .",
    "starting from the experimental observations from cubic to tetragonal transitions , our goal would be the growth of the so - called twin variants .",
    "these correspond to regions of alternating @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( e.g. ) domains separated by interfaces parallel to the @xmath37 axis and forming an angle of @xmath38 with the @xmath39 and @xmath40 axis .",
    "equivalent structures will be the @xmath4-@xmath6 twins separated by interfaces parallel to the @xmath40 axis and forming @xmath38 with the @xmath39 and @xmath37 axis , and with the @xmath5-@xmath6 twins separated by interfaces parallel to the @xmath37 axis and forming @xmath38 with the @xmath39 and @xmath40 axis .",
    "in addition , we would be interested in controlling the width @xmath41 of such twins .",
    "if one truncates the dipolar term to only first and second nearest - neighbors , it is not possible to stabilize such twin variants , except for the case with width @xmath42 , which in fact corresponds to domains displaying a chessboard structure as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) . due to lattice geometry",
    ", third - nearest neighbor interaction can not lead to wider structures and it is only by including 4n terms that we can obtain a @xmath43 structure , which is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .    in order to study the range of parameters in which the different microstructures occur ,",
    "we have performed a comparison of the energies of the different configurations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , with @xmath44 .",
    "the analytical results presented here are general for any system size provided that the proposed configurations are compatible with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the values of the energy as a function of the model parameters ( in the absence of disorder ) of each of the configurations considered above are given by : @xmath45    from such energy functions one can obtain the phase diagram that indicates the boundaries between the structures that minimize the energy .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig3 ] .    as can be seen , the eqs .",
    "[ energie_lambda4 ] allow the existence of ground - state twinned structures @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath46 , while no other phases can exist .",
    "although the @xmath43 structure is good enough for our objective of studying kinetic constraints , we have also analyzed the modifications one should perform on the model in order to obtain ground - state twin structures with larger widths .",
    "the guess is that higher order dipolar terms would lead to the stabilization of the wider @xmath41 domains . to confirm this guess ,",
    "let us once again consider a @xmath47 system , and add the seventh nearest - neighbor term ( that is , the neighbors at a distance of @xmath48 from the reference elementary domain ) .",
    "the energies of the various phases are now : @xmath49 an example of a projection of the phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where it can be seen that the @xmath50 phase is now stable .",
    "the borders between the phases are calculated with eqs .",
    "[ energie_lambda6 ] .    for the remainder of the paper we will concentrate on the @xmath51 case , and in the region where @xmath43 .",
    "most of the results presented will correspond to @xmath52 and @xmath53 .      in fig.[fig5](a )",
    "we show an example of microstructures obtained by the numerical simulations of the hamiltonian ( eq . [ hamiltoniana ] ) using athermal dynamics .",
    "we represent only three perpendicular projections of our 3d calculation .",
    "this example thus only supplies qualitative information . in section [ fourier_analysis ]",
    "we will perform a fourier analysis in order to gain some global information .    from the figure [ fig5](a )",
    "it is clear that some local structures of the kind @xmath43 arise , but that we are very far from the ground - states computed previously ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the global structure is more complex and displays mixing of the three possible twin domains .",
    "taking into account that there are @xmath54 twin pairs and that each of them can occur in @xmath55 different equivalent orientations and that , given our underlying discrete lattice , there are @xmath56 possible translations ( for our @xmath43 case ) , the number of different twin domains is @xmath57 .",
    "another interesting example is given is fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "this figure corresponds to the saturation configuration obtained by the application of a very high external compression in the @xmath37 direction , disfavoring the associated @xmath6 variant . in this case",
    ", the formation of diagonal @xmath43 domains in the @xmath58 plane is already very clear at first sight , confirming the importance of kinetic constraints arising due to the coexistence of the three equivalent variants .",
    "it is interesting too to analyze the microstructure of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 planes . in this case , quite elongated domains formed by vertical alternating stripes with periodicity @xmath55 arise , as indicated in the figure .",
    "this kind of domains have been observed experimentally in a iron - palladium ferromagnetic shape - memory alloy , displaying a cubic to tetragonal martensitic transition @xcite .      in this section",
    "we study the effect of the system size and of the hamiltonian parameters on the hysteresis cycles . as will be seen in all of the figures of this section , the two branches of the loops are strongly asymmetric , due to the physical difference between the process of transformation from a one - variant phase to a three - variant phase ( ascending branch ) and _ vice - versa _ in the descending case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show some examples of hysteresis loops obtained by varying the amount of disorder @xmath29 .",
    "the loops have a tendency to display plateaus , which are smooth when disorder increases .",
    "an additional effect of disorder is also to tilt the hysteresis loops .    in figs .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we present examples of the effect of the dipolar parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 . within the region of stability of the @xmath43 phase ,",
    "the plateaus are always present , provided that disorder is not too high .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we study the effect of system size on the hysteresis loops .",
    "the loops do not show a strong size dependence , and the plateaus are clearly not a finite - size effect . in the following",
    "we will restrict our simulations to the affordable intermediate size @xmath61 .",
    "all the hysteresis cycles that we have shown in this section display qualitatively the same behavior , consisting of a certain number ( 2 - 3 ) of plateaus , where the transformed fraction remains constant in a range of @xmath14 values .",
    "this feature suggests that the transformation of the @xmath3 phase has a tendency to split into steps , the first involving the transformation of more than 50% of the lattice . in the next sections we will try to elucidate the physical reasons behind this tendency .      in order to investigate the nature of the intermediate steps of the hysteresis cycles we can analyze the system configurations in real space at various points of the loops , as indicated in fig.[fig9](a ) .",
    "we also show the derivative @xmath62 which better reflects the activity of the transition and reveals the importance of the first transformation step compared to the others .",
    "these kinds of activity curves can be compared with the experimental data from calorimetry or acoustic emission activity .",
    "the microstructures on each indicated point of the ascending branch are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] .",
    "a first inspection reveals that the transition basically proceeds by nucleation events .",
    "there is some growth , but almost no coarsening since the possibilities for two domains to match are small .",
    "one can also see that re - transformation events are common .",
    "the observed step in the hysteresis loop is clearly associated with the fact that martensite domains percolate in the sample . at this point",
    "the system needs an extra increase of the driving force to proceed .",
    "the subsequent domains will grow surrounded by a complex boundary of the martensitic phase .",
    "therefore , the growth dynamics will be very different from the nucleation of the first domains in a cubic phase environment . in the second part , there are many re - transformation events until the final saturated microstructure is obtained . after a more careful study of the snapshots one can infer that in the first step of the transformation , corresponding to the snapshots from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , the system chooses to develop oblate ( disk - like ) domains . for instance ,",
    "one can see in snapshot number 3 that the @xmath4-phase ( black ) tends to be distributed in extended regions in the @xmath60 plane , whereas it shows elongated domains perpendicular to the @xmath39-axis on the @xmath58 and @xmath59 planes .",
    "such structures correspond to the structures that optimize the nn dipolar interaction term ( @xmath24 ) , as we studied in a preliminary work @xcite . in a second step , when the external field is comparable to the value of the parameter @xmath25 , the system is able to develop the @xmath43 structures with the desired orientation , and one starts to see regions of twin domains with the @xmath65 orientation on the different planes .",
    "of course , they are very much influenced by the domains that have already grown .",
    "this interpretation can even be argued by confronting the curves for different values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . for a better quantitative understanding of this effect , it is convenient to perform the analysis of the microstructures in fourier space .",
    "a quite natural way to analyze the system microstructure is to study the fourier transform ( ft ) of the density function .",
    "in fact , as it is well known , the square modulus of this quantity represents the intensity that can be obtained from scattering experiments . in our case , at saturation we have the coexistence of three variants , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , and thus it is useful to separately consider three density matrices @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in analogy",
    "we can define the density matrix of the @xmath3 phase @xmath69 , and transform the four matrices individually .",
    "thus each variant @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is associated with a scattered intensity : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the generic position vector , and @xmath74 .",
    "the elements of these four density matrices can take the values @xmath63 or @xmath75 , representing , respectively ,",
    "the occupation or the vacancy of a lattice site by a variant of a given color . the presence of disorder can locally favors one or the other variant , but since the disorder is randomly extracted , we expect variants behavior to be equivalent on average .",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to studying just one variant , e.g. the @xmath4 one , without loss of generality . in the simulations",
    "we have verified that the color equivalence is effectively fulfilled . in the following",
    "we will address only this case .    in fig.[fig11",
    "] we show the position of the peaks of the squared fourier transform of the density of the @xmath76 variant in the ideal case @xmath43 .",
    "we observe that bragg peaks occur at the position @xmath77 and in symmetric equivalent positions .",
    "in fact , if one performs the fourier transform of the density of @xmath76-phase corresponding , for instance , to the snapshot in fig.[fig2 ] , one obtains only two of the eight bragg reflections shown in fig.[fig11 ] .",
    "nevertheless , for symmetry reasons one has to consider the two possible @xmath65 orientations and also that the phase @xmath76 would be present not only in the @xmath78 twin , but also in the @xmath79 twin .",
    "translations of the configuration with the same domain orientation give the same contribution .",
    "therefore , we shall expect the @xmath80 bragg reflections shown in fig.[fig11 ] with equal intensity @xmath81 , where the contribution @xmath82 is given by the intensity of the two secondary peaks that arise for each of the four ideal configurations where the variant @xmath4 is present , and the factor @xmath83 is due to the average over all the six possible ideal configurations .",
    "the peak at the origin stands for the fraction of the system which is covered by the @xmath84 phase , and thus its intensity is given by @xmath85 , where again the factor @xmath86 is due to the average over the six possibilities . in a real experimental case , the widths of the twin domains will be much bigger than the @xmath43 lattice spacing and , therefore the growth of the martensitic tetragonal domains will be revealed by satellite peaks occurring close to the cubic bragg reflections in the directions ( 1,1,0 ) ( and equivalent ones ) .    in fig .  [ fig12 ]",
    "we show the fourier analysis of the microstructures obtained after saturating the system by the numerical simulations . the intensity is averaged over @xmath87 realizations of disorder .",
    "we see that the peaks appear at the positions expected from the ground - state structures , but the widths of the peaks are quite large .    in analogy with the study performed in real space , we can study the evolution of the fourier transform along the hysteresis cycles .",
    "this is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] .",
    "as we have already noticed , the system evolution begins with a tendency to form and grow disk - like domains which correspond to peaks at @xmath88 ( and equivalent ) .",
    "after the first plateau the intensity is transferred to the final positions at @xmath77 ( and equivalent ) .    in order to gain a quantitative insight into the dynamics of the transition , we have analyzed the evolution of the scattered intensity corresponding to some significant vectors of the fourier space . in fig .",
    "[ intensita](a ) , we present the evolution of the diagonal @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "as can be seen , the peak is slightly shifted from the ideal position @xmath91 ( and equivalent ) . in particular , the position is closer to the origin , meaning that the formation of some thinner structure is affecting the average .",
    "this effect is due to the presence of the disorder and of the dynamic constraints . in fig.[intensita](b ) , we present the evolution of the intensity as a function of the transformed fraction @xmath33 .",
    "we choose @xmath33 and not @xmath14 as the independent variable since , as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] ,  [ fig7 ] and  [ fig8 ] , the jumps in the hysteresis cycles are very sharp . as can be seen , the @xmath92 and the @xmath77 values grow monotonically with @xmath33 as one could expect , and the intensity at @xmath77 and @xmath93 tends to disappear at saturation .",
    "the scattered intensity in this latter position is a measure of the disorder in the system , since in the ideal configuration the corresponding value of @xmath94 is zero . in the figure we confront the @xmath92 and the @xmath77 values with the related theoretical values at saturation .",
    "the value of the @xmath92 peak for @xmath20 is in perfect agreement with the expected one , while the @xmath77 , even if increasing , as it should do in the presence of @xmath43 structures , keeps far from the ideal value .",
    "furthermore , the predominance of the @xmath43 structures arises only in the last part of the hysteresis branch , where the reduced transformed fraction goes from @xmath95 to @xmath20 .",
    "these effects are due to the presence of disorder and of the kinetic constraints associated with the presence of many competing growing domains .",
    "we have presented a model for the statistical study of microstructures in martensitic phase transitions .",
    "we have focused on the cubic to tetragonal case .",
    "the model is not aimed at exactly reproducing the microstructure details but only to provide a statistical picture of the different phenomena that may occur during the transition and that will constrain the final martensitic state .",
    "our model allows some dynamical aspects of the mt that occur due to the existence of kinetic constraints to be studied . among others",
    ", we have shown the existence of domain re - transformation , the fact that the transition may proceed through several steps , and the existence of intermediate structures that minimize only the short - range term of the dipolar interaction .",
    "the fourier transform of the obtained microstructures has enabled a quantitative analysis of such phenomena after taking averages over disorder configurations .",
    "although some of the observed phenomena may not be totally realistic due to the cut - off that we have introduced in the long - range interaction , we have shown that the model is good enough to exhibit kinetic constraints .",
    "the possibility for extending the interactions to real long - range interactions is still open and , although it will require much longer computing times , should not be excluded for a future work .    in our opinion , the presented results quite clearly justify the importance of a statistical approach to the martensitic phase transition .",
    "we finally propose that , besides the real imaging experiments , many more `` in situ '' scattering experiments will be desirable in order to gain understanding into the dynamics of microstructure formation in martensites .",
