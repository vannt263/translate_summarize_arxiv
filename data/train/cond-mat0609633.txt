    "studies of ferromagnetic half - metals are mainly driven by their possible applications for spintronic devices as a potential source of a 100% spin polarized current .",
    "heusler alloys are promising candidates for these applications due to their high curie temperature and expected half - metallicity even for partially disordered systems .",
    "recently , the l2@xmath1 ordered co@xmath0fesi  ( cfs ) heusler compound attracted a lot of attention from both experimental and theoretical points of view.@xcite up to now , cfs exhibits the highest observed magnetic moment ( ) per formula unit ( at , corresponding to an average value of per atom ) and the highest curie temperature ( ) among the so - called heusler compounds and half - metallic ferromagnets.@xcite cfs grows fully epitaxial on mgo(001 ) forming a l2@xmath1 structure.@xcite a very high tunnelling magnetoresistance of 41% at rt and 60% at 5k were reported for cfs / al - oxide / co@xmath3fe@xmath4 samples,@xcite whose crystalline structure was unclear , however . moreover , time resolved photoemission studies resolving the spin polarization at the fermi level indicated a rather low value of only 12% for cfs films grown on mgo(001 ) substrates.@xcite further studies revealed that the observed reduction of the spin polarization can not only be attributed to surface effects , as it also takes place up to about away from the surface .",
    "@xcite moreover , recent studies showed that cfs films exhibit a huge quadratic magneto - optical kerr effect ( qmoke ) with amplitudes of up to , which is the largest qmoke observed so far .",
    "this effect is a fingerprint of an unusually large spin - orbit coupling of second or higher order .",
    "@xcite    in order to understand the origin of these intriguing magneto - optical properties , it is advantageous to have a method at hand which can be used to tune them in a controlled way",
    ". it has been shown that irradiation with kev ions is an efficient method to modify the properties of many magnetic thin film systems , such as copt multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy,@xcite exchange bias bilayers,@xcite or interlayer exchange coupled trilayers.@xcite moreover , it was demonstrated that such modifications can be performed with high spatial resolution , making ion irradiation an attractive patterning tool in view of technological applications.@xcite in this work we demonstrate that the magnetic and , in particular , the magneto - optical properties of cfs heusler alloys can also be modified by means of kev ion irradiation .",
    "we have investigated a cfs film of thicknesses of prepared by rf magnetron sputtering and deposited directly onto mgo(001 ) .",
    "the film was covered by a thick al protective layer . as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", these films grow in the l2@xmath1 ordered structure . a detailed description of the sample preparation process as well as structural properties of cfs films can be found in ref.@xcite .",

    "the sample area which was irradiated with the highest fluence of exhibits paramagnetic properties .",
    "( ii ) the loop recorded from the nonirradiated area shows a large loop asymmetry .",
    "this asymmetry originates from a superimposed qmoke contribution , @xcite which results in an even contribution to the measured moke loop .",
    "all loops recorded from irradiated areas exhibit a much smaller asymmetry , i.e. , a much smaller qmoke contribution .",
    "( iii ) the loop asymmetry ( i.e. , the indication of qmoke contribution ) is reverted when @xmath8 is changed from @xmath9 to @xmath10 reflecting the characteristic fourfold symmetry of the qmoke originating from a cubic crystal . @xcite",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 , as well as the lmoke and qmoke amplitudes on the applied ion fluence is given in fig .",
    "[ f : irrad ] .",
    "@xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ f : irrad](a ) ) and the lmoke amplitude ( fig .  [ f : irrad](b ) ) show a similar behavior ; they are decreasing very slowly up to an ion fluence of @xmath11 . for higher fluences ,",
    "both @xmath7 and lmoke decrease faster and finally vanish at a fluence of when the sample becomes paramagnetic .",
    "this behavior shows that the sample retains ferromagnetic properties up to high irradiation fluences , which is an indication that these properties are resistant to a certain degree of atomic disorder in the cfs structure .",
    "as discussed in point ( ii ) , sect .",
    "[ s : iii ] , there is a large suppression of the qmoke signal even for small applied doses . in order to determine the amplitude of the pure qmoke effect quantitatively , the 8-directional procedure described in @xcite is used . within this procedure , the in - plane magnetic field",
    "is subsequently applied in directions from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , defined in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f : irrad](b ) . in order to almost suppress the lmoke signal , a nearly normal angle of incidence of light",
    "is used ( incidence angle is about @xmath14 ) .",
    "the qmoke consists of two contributions , being proportional to @xmath15 and @xmath16 terms , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the longitudinal and transverse direction , respectively , as defined in the inset of fig .",

    "( [ eq : mlmt ] ) represents the amplitude of variation of the qmoke signal with @xmath8 whereas @xmath28 is a constant contribution to the qmoke signal independent on sample orientation .",
    "the dependence of the qmoke amplitude @xmath27 on the applied ion fluence is presented in fig .",
    "[ f : irrad](b ) .",
    "the qmoke amplitude of the non - irradiated area is equal to whereas it decreases rapidly to only for the smallest ion fluence of .",
    "the constant term @xmath28 ( not presented in fig .  [",
    "f : irrad](b ) ) also provides a similar drop as @xmath27 with applied ion fluence .",
    "it was checked that this rapid decrease of the qmoke amplitude with the applied ion fluence also appears for the corresponding kerr ellipticity .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the drop of the qmoke signal upon irradiation is related to a change of the electronic structure of cfs .",
    "contrary to lmoke , the qmoke signal appears to be very sensitive to ion irradiation and , therefore , to atomic disorder of the cfs structure .",
    "it is known that qmoke and lmoke effects are related to the electronic structure of a given sample in different ways.@xcite fig .  [",
    "f : micro](a ) presents a simplified sketch of electronic structure of a ferromagnetic material for one point of @xmath29-space.@xcite here , we limit ourselves only to @xmath30 transitions , we assume no exchange between @xmath31-states , and we show only dipolar ( i.e. , optical ) transitions to @xmath31 states @xmath32 . in our simplified sketch , the exchange interaction @xmath33 splits only the @xmath34 states into @xmath35 and @xmath36 for up- and down - electron levels , respectively .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath35 and @xmath36 states are split by spin - orbit ( so ) coupling @xmath37 accordingly to the magnetic quantum number @xmath38 of electrons in @xmath34 states .",
    "depending on the difference @xmath39 of the magnetic quantum numbers between the final ( here @xmath31 ) and initial ( here @xmath34 ) states , circularly left ( @xmath40 ) or circularly right ( @xmath41 ) polarized photons can be absorbed by the electronic structure .",
    "the absorbtion spectra for both polarizations are sketched in fig .",
    "[ f : micro](b ) .",
    "when both exchange and so coupling are present , the absorption spectra for the left and right polarized light are different . in such a case , a non - zero kerr effect arises .",
    "@xcite however , when either exchange or so coupling are not present ( i.e. , @xmath42 _ or _",
    "@xmath43 ) , then the absorption spectra are identical , providing zero kerr effect .",
    "from a microscopic point of view , the lmoke originates from a component of @xmath44 parallel to @xmath29 whereas the qmoke originates from a component of @xmath44 perpendicular to @xmath29 , where @xmath29 denotes the vector of propagation of light in matter.@xcite in the following we discuss changes in the electronic structure for @xmath45 ( related to lmoke ) and @xmath46 ( related to qmoke ) , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ f : micro](a , c ) .    in the case of @xmath45 ,",
    "the so coupling is proportional to the spin - orbit coupling parameter @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( fig .  [ f : micro](a ) ) . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath46 ,",
    "the first order of so coupling in @xmath47 is zero , @xmath49 .",
    "therefore only spin - orbit effects of second or higher order are able to remove the degeneracy of the initial or final state .",
    "@xcite usually , higher orders of so coupling are much smaller than the first order , @xmath50 , leading to a much smaller qmoke amplitude in comparison with the corresponding lmoke amplitude in most materials .",
    "according to the previous discussion , the suppression of the lmoke amplitude by means of large applied ion fluences ( from ) may be understood either in terms of a reduction of exchange interaction or a reduction of the first order of so coupling .",
    "as the lmoke exhibits a behavior similar to that of @xmath7 , we may conclude that it is the exchange interaction in cfs which is reduced by large fluences of ga@xmath2 ions . on the other hand",
    ", the first order of so coupling seems to persist at such high fluences .",
    "if so coupling disappears before exchange , a decreasing lmoke amplitude should be observed with increasing fluence but the magnetic properties of the sample should not vary drastically .    in the case of non - irradiated cfs films ,",
    "an unusually large qmoke amplitude was measured , indicating a presence of a large so coupling of second or higher order .",
    "furthermore , small ion fluences solely reduce the qmoke amplitude .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that second or higher order contributions to so coupling are very sensitive to small fluences of ga@xmath2 ion irradiation in cfs",
    ". however , a deeper microscopic reason for this effect is not yet clear .",
    "the effect of ga@xmath2 ion irradiation on epitaxial co@xmath0fesi(cfs ) film having l2@xmath1 structure and deposited onto mgo(001 ) was studied by means of the longitudinal ( lmoke ) and quadratic ( qmoke ) magneto - optical kerr effect . both the coercivity and the lmoke exhibit a similar behavior on the applied ion fluence : they are nearly constant up to an ion fluence of , after which they decrease and finally vanish at a fluence of , when the sample becomes paramagnetic .",
    "the fluence dependence of the qmoke signal is very different : its amplitude drops from for a non - irradiated sample region to for the smallest applied fluence of .",
    "the observed reduction of the qmoke signal is attributed to an irradiation - induced degeneration of second or higher order contributions to the spin - orbit coupling , which already happens at small ion fluences . on the other hand",
    ", the reduction of coercivity and lmoke at high ion fluences can be attributed to a reduction of exchange interaction within the irradiated areas .",
