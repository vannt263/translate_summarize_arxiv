    "this paper is meant to contribute to the present discussion about the existence or non - existence of stationary equilibrium configurations consisting of separate bodies at rest .",
    "hermann weyl , whom jrgen ehlers admired especially , was the first person to consider the problem of two separate static ( axisymmetric ) bodies in equilibrium @xcite . to mention only one modern advancement in this field",
    "we refer to a paper by beig and schoen  @xcite , who were able to prove a non - existence theorem for a reflectionally symmetric _ static _ @xmath0-body configuration .",
    "our intention is to involve the interaction of the angular momenta of rotating bodies ( `` spin - spin interaction '' ) which could generate repulsive effects compensating the omnipresent mass attraction .",
    "a characteristic example for such a stationary configuration could be the equilibrium between two aligned rotating black holes",
    ". we will present and review a chain of old and new arguments which finally forbid the equilibrium situation .",
    "our argumentation is based on a boundary value problem for two separate ( killing- ) horizons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) and the characterization of _ sub - extremal _ black holes by booth and fairhurst @xcite and follows the ideas of manko and ruiz @xcite who solved the equilibrium problem for the so - called double - kerr solution .     and @xmath1 of the two black holes are located in the intervals @xmath2 $ ] and @xmath3 $ ] on the @xmath4-axis , respectively .",
    "the remaining parts @xmath5 , @xmath6 of the @xmath4-axis correspond to the rotation axis.,scaledwidth=34.0% ]    the double - kerr ( more precicely : double - kerr - nut ) solution , first derived in @xcite , is a seven parameter solution constructed by a two - fold bcklund transformation of minkowski space .",
    "since a single bcklund transformation generates the kerr - nut solution that contains , by a special choice of its three parameters , the stationary black hole solution ( kerr solution ) and since bcklund transformations act as a `` nonlinear '' superposition principle , the double - kerr - nut solution was considered to be a good candidate for the solution of the two horizon problem and extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , there was no argument requiring that this particular solution be the _ only _ candidate . in this paper",
    "we will remove this objection and show that the discussion of a boundary value problem for two separate horizons necessarily leads to the double - kerr - nut solution .",
    "thus we can make use of the equilibrium conditions for this solution which ensure that the intervals @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( see fig .  [ fig:0 ] ) are regular parts of the axis of symmetry .",
    "after a too restrictive ansatz in @xcite , tomimatsu and kihara derived and discussed a complete set of equilibrium conditions on the axis .",
    "reformulations and numerical studies by hoenselaers @xcite made plausible that the two gravitational sources ( black hole candidates ) of the double - kerr - nut solution ( located at the intervals @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) can not be in equilibrium if their komar masses are positive . the first decisive step toward",
    "prove the hoenselaers conjecture was taken by manko , ruiz and sanabria - gmez @xcite , who derived an explicit and easily applicable form of the tomimatsu - kihara equilibrium conditions and , as an important complement , analytical formulae for the komar masses and angular momenta of the gravitational sources .",
    "manko and ruiz @xcite completed their non - existence proof by showing that the equilibrium conditions for the double - kerr - nut solution are indeed violated for positive komar masses .",
    "this is , however , a critical point of their analysis .",
    "to the best of our knowledge there is no argument in favour of the positiveness of the komar mass .",
    "( on the contrary , ansorg and petroff @xcite have given a convincing counterexample . )    in this paper we replace the komar mass inequality ( positivity of the komar mass of each black hole ) by an inequality connecting angular momentum and horizon area @xcite .",
    "this relation is based on the causal structure of trapped surfaces in the interior vicinity of the event horizon @xcite . in this way",
    "we can complete the no - go theorem , avoiding more laborious investigations of the domain outside the horizons and off the axis of symmetry ( e.g. , the search for singular rings or other singularities  in sec .",

    "the metric allows an abelian group of motions @xmath24 with the generators ( killing vectors ) @xmath25 where the kronecker symbols @xmath26 and @xmath27 indicate that @xmath28 has only a @xmath23-component whereas @xmath29 points in the azimuthal @xmath30-direction along closed circles .",

    "nevertheless , it is interesting to study further properties of the solution , . in the following two subsections we comment shortly on the interior of the two gravitational sources and give numerical evidence for the existence of singularities outside the horizons @xmath18 and @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that every axisymmetric and stationary black hole , which is regular in an _ exterior _ neighbourhood of the event horizon , also possesses a regular _ interior _ region inside the event horizon .",
    "in particular , there always exists a regular inner cauchy horizon and the inner solution does not develop singularities before this horizon is reached .",
    "moreover , the spacetime is even regular at the cauchy horizon , provided that the angular momentum @xmath215 of the black hole does not vanish .",
    "remarkably , the areas @xmath201 and @xmath216 of event and inner cauchy horizon satisfy the equation @xmath217    it is interesting to test this relation explicitly for both of the two gravitational sources in the double - kerr - nut solution , . for that purpose",
    ", we calculate the areas @xmath218 , @xmath219 of the horizons @xmath18 , @xmath1 using and .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the areas of cauchy horizons can be calculated from analytical continuations of @xmath108 and @xmath181 into regions with @xmath220 and @xmath221 , respectively . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath222 using these formulae , the explicit calculation shows that the equations @xmath223 are indeed satisfied , i.e. holds for both gravitational sources .      as we have proved in sec .",
    "[ sub ] , at least one of the two `` black holes '' in the double - kerr - nut solution , is not sub - extremal for which reason the solution is not physically reasonable .",
    "it may then well be that singularities outside the horizons appear .    to tackle this problem",
    "we ask whether the determinant in the denominator of the representation of the ernst potential @xmath57 has zeros off the axis .",
    "a numerical study for a large number of parameter values shows that this is indeed the case , see figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ] . as a consequence ,",
    "the ernst potential becomes singular at these zeros ( it can be shown that the numerator does not vanish at the same coordinate positions ) , i.e. there exist _ singular rings _ outside the horizons .",
    "our numerical investigations seem to indicate that _ every double - kerr - nut solution with the special parameter relations suffers from the presence of singular rings_.     vanish . at the intersection",
    "points @xmath224 , @xmath225 , ( @xmath226 ) , the ernst potential diverges .",
    "the horizons @xmath18 , @xmath1 are marked as black lines on the @xmath4-axis .",
    "parameters : @xmath227 , @xmath228 , @xmath229 ( left panel ) and @xmath230 , @xmath231 , @xmath232 ( right panel ) . ]     for the example configuration in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , right panel . ]",
    "the stationary equilibrium of two aligned rotating black holes can be described by a boundary value problem for two separate ( killing- ) horizons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) . applying the inverse ( scattering ) method , one can show that the solution of the problem is a ( particular case of the ) double - kerr - nut solution ( a solution originally generated by a two - fold bcklund transformation of minkowski space ) .",
    "the regularity conditions to be satisfied by the metric on the axis of symmetry outside the two horizons restrict the number of free parameters entering the solution .",
    "the resulting 3-parameter solution ( written in dimensionless coordinates ) does not satisfy the characteristic condition @xmath233 for each of the two black holes ( @xmath215 : angular momentum , @xmath201 : area of the horizon ) .",
    "since this inequality is a consequence of the geometry of trapped surfaces in the interior vicinity of the event horizon of every sub - extremal black hole , there exists no stationary equilibrium configuration for two aligned sub - extremal black holes .",
