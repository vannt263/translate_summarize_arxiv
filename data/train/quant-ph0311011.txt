    "when two photons meet in a beamsplitter from two input ports , how do they exit from the output ports ?",
    "this is an interesting topic concerning the quantum nature of photon interference .",
    "the first experimental observations of two - photon interference in a beam splitter were reported in 1980s.@xcite@xcite in the experiments , two photons to be interfered are spatially separated and degenerated with the same frequency and polarization .",
    "this can be done by the spontaneously parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) of type i in a crystal , in which a pair of photons , signal and idle , are produced . in the degenerate case ,",
    "two photons are mixed in a 50/50 beamsplitter , no coincidence count of photons is found at two output ports .",
    "this effect was lately called the photon coalescence interference ( ci),@xcite since two photons meeting in beamsplitter go together .",
    "the early theoretical explanation was based on indistinguishability of two single photons , that is , the interference occurs for the degenerate photons when they meet in a beamsplitter . in the further experiments , it has been found that , in addition to the degenerate photons , the two - photon interference may occur for two photons with different colors and polarizations.@xcite-@xcite however , for the degenerate case when the individual signal photon and the idle photon are arranged out of their coherent range ( they do not meet at the beamsplitter ) , the interference is still observed.@xcite-@xcite obviously , these phenomena can not be explained by the indistinguishability of two single photons . as a matter of fact",
    ", all the above experiments were performed by the spdc , the source emitting entangled photon pairs .",
    "a successful theoretical explanation is to use two - photon entanglement with the help of conceptual feynman diagrams in which the pair of photons interfered should be seen as a whole , the two - photon or biphoton , so that the photon entanglement plays an essential role in two - photon interference.@xcite@xcite recently , the interference of two independent photons has been studied experimentally and theoretically.@xcite-@xcite santori et al @xcite has demonstrated in their experiment , that two independent single - photon pulses emitted by a semiconductor quantum dot show a coalescence interference in a beamsplitter . in this case , it seems that one can not use the concept  biphoton  because the photon entanglement is absent .",
    "as we review all these studies on two - photon interference , it could be confusing why sometimes two nondegenerate photons can interfere with each other and sometimes they can not , and sometimes the interference of two degenerate photons occurs only when they meet together and sometimes the photon meeting is not necessarily the case .",
    "a reasonable explanation could be attributed to photon entanglement .",
    "as mentioned above , the entangled pair for two nondegenerate photons should be seen as a biphoton and the interference occurs between biphotons .",
    "therefore , it might be concluded that there are two kinds of interference mechanisms : the  biphoton picture  for entangled photon pair and  two photons picture  for independent photons .",
    "if that is true , one has to face a perplexed question , as argued in the development of quantum mechanics , how the ",
    "clever photons  know whether they should behave as a biphoton or a single - photon in the interference .    in this paper ,",
    "we contribute a complete theoretical description for two - photon interference in a beamsplitter . since any realistic beam should have a finite frequency range which must be taken into account , we study the two - photon state in a wavepacket which can be either entangled or un - entangled .",
    "the quantum descriptions of the beam splitter can be implemented in both the schrdinger picture ( s - picture ) and the heisenberg picture ( h - picture ) . since the beamsplitter introduces a simple transform for field operators , the theoretical description in the h - picture is more convenient , and it was exploited in the most theoretical discussions . though the two pictures should give an identical result , the description in the h - picture averages the distinct information on quantum state .",
    "instead , we discuss this issue in the s - picture , so it can show more physical understanding for the nature of two - photon interference .",
    "the net coincidence probability  can be readily evaluated by our theory .",
    "we find that the symmetry of two - photon spectrum plays a key role in the interference manners .",
    "we distinguish the coalescence and anti - coalescence interferences ( aci ) , and find out the necessary and sufficient condition for the perfect ci and aci .",
    "we prove that the photon entanglement is irrelevant to ci , but necessary for aci .",
    "therefore , the aci effect is the signature of two - photon entanglement , and it could be an effective experimental method to detect photon entanglement . however , we propose a two - photon transparent state which can pass the beamsplitter with a full transparency .",
    "the theory covers two cases : two - photon state in a polarization mode and in two polarization modes , which may correspond to the source of spdc of type i and type ii , respectively .",
    "let us briefly review how the quantum interference happens .",
    "if a quantum system consists of more than one source , or the interaction includes several parts , the state of the system @xmath0 is a coherent superposition of these sources or parts @xmath1 assume that all the states @xmath2 and @xmath3 are distinguishable each with others , there is no quantum interference . if , however , there are some indistinguishable states generated in these coherent sources such as @xmath4 state @xmath5 in two sources has to be added together",

    "in other words , the quantum interference happens if the interference term ( [ b3 ] ) is not null .",
    "there are two reasons for the absence of interference .",
    "one possible reason is simply that there is no indistinguishable state between two sources , that is @xmath9 or @xmath10 .",
    "another reason could be out of phase for two coherent amplitudes , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this sense ,",
    "the indistinguishable state is only a necessary condition for interference , but not a sufficient one .",
    "the relative phase between the amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath13 may settle the interference absence , constructive and destructive according to null , positive and negative interference terms , respectively .    in the language of quantum state , in essence , the interference originates from the coherent superposition of probability amplitudes for the indistinguishable states of different sources .",
    "we survey two - photon interference in this picture .",
    "a beam splitter performs a linear transform for two input optical beams . in the quantum regime",
    ", the bosonic commutation must be satisfied for all the field operators in the beamsplitter transform .",
