    "according to the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the central massive black hole , its surrounding accreting material and the broad - line region ( blr ) are all embedded within a dusty region , probably a thick molecular torus .",
    "along some directions , the dust extinction is sufficient to block all uv , optical , and near - ir radiation originating in the inner components .",
    "a review of the arguments which led to this picture is presented in wills ( 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of a universal inflection point near 1.2   in the spectral energy distribution of radio - quiet agn s strongly suggests that the bulk of the near ir flux arises from dust thermal emission ( e.g. , barvainis 1987 ; sanders et al .",
    "the corresponding color temperature , @xmath6 1,500k , matches closely the sublimation temperature of graphite , the most resilient of the grain constituents .",
    "the near ir emission can be variable , and therefore originates , at least in part , in a compact region .",
    "furthermore , in three agn , the near ir variations have been shown to be delayed with respect to the uv - optical variations .",
    "the time delay corresponds closely to the light - travel time to the dust sublimation radius @xmath7 ; measured values of @xmath7 are 400 light days for ( clavel et al .",
    "1989 ) , 50 light days for ( baribaud et al .",
    "1992 ) , 80 light days for ( glass 1992 ) and 32 light days for mrk 744 ( nelson , 1996 ) .",
    "the emerging picture is one where the near to mid - ir emission arises from thermal re - radiation of uv and optical photons absorbed by the circumnuclear dust .",
    "various models for the geometry and location of this dust have been proposed , but the exact configuration of the models remains unconstrained due to a lack of suitable observational data .",
    "one can use variability as a tool to probe the _ inner _  few lightyears of the dusty regions .",
    "reverberation - mapping techniques ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) have been used extensively to map the blr in several agn , on scales of lightdays to lightmonths , notably by the international agn watchagnwatch/. ] consortium ( alloin et al .",
    "1994 ) . a similar approach can be used to probe the ir - emitting region , i.e. the warm dust component within the obscuring material . given uv flux variations of sufficient amplitudes , a mid - ir monitoring campaign of sufficiently long duration and adequate sampling rate , it may in principle",
    "be possible to recover the transfer function of the dust .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) offerred a unique opportunity to carry out such a spectrophotometric monitoring program in the mid - ir .",
    "the seyfert 1 galaxy mrk  279 ( @xmath8 ) was selected because its celestial position allows an uninterrupted 12-month visibility window for iso and it has a well - documented variability history in the optical ( osterbrock & shuder 1982 ; peterson et al .  1985 ; maoz et al .  1990 ; stirpe et al .",
    "1994 , the uv ( chapman et al .  1985 ) , and x - rays ( reichert et al .  1985 ) .",
    "balmer - line time - delays ( maoz et al . 1990 ; stirpe & de bruyn 1991 ; stirpe et al . 1994 ) suggest a blr size in the range 6 to 12 lightdays .",
    "a search for day - to - day variability across the balmer - line profile was unsuccessful ( eracleous & halpern 1993 ) .",
    "no far - ir flux variations were detected with iras ( edelson & malkan 1987 ) .",
    "mrk  279 was observed with two of the instruments on board the iso satellite : nine narrow - band filter images were obtained with isocam ( cesarsky et al .",
    "1996 ) , while spectra were recorded with the pht - s spectrometer , a subsystem of the isophot instrument ( lemke et al .",
    "the pht - s spectrometer covers the 2.512  spectral range at a mean resolution of @xmath43150 , with a gap between 4.9 and 5.9 .",
    "its entrance aperture projects to @xmath9 on the sky .",
    "all pht - s observations were carried - out in an identical fashion .",
    "the integrating amplifiers were reset every 32s and on - source measurements were interleaved with background measurements by `` chopping '' on the sky at a frequency of 1/256 hz . the chopper throw was set to 300@xmath10 . for each of the observations ,",
    "total on - source integration time was 2048  s and total observing time ( including background measurements and instrument overheads ) was 4236  s.    the cam observations were performed in staring mode at a magnification of @xmath11 per pixel and with a gain of 2 .",
    "nine different filters were used .",
    "the unit integration time was 2.1s per readout and there were between 72 and 197 readouts per image , depending on the filter used .",
    "the particular sequence of filters was chosen to go from high to low illumination so as to minimize the detector stabilization time .",
    "good stabilization was also guaranteed by the relatively large number of readouts per exposure .",
    "the pht - s observations were made at 16 different epochs , from 1996 , february 5 to 1997 , february 13 ( table  1 ) .",
    "the isocam observations of mrk  279 were all carried out on 1996 february 5 , contemporaneously with the first of the pht - s spectra .",
    "standard procedures from the cam interactive analysis ( cia ) software package were used for the reduction of the isocam data ( ott et al .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of mrk  279 varies with the filter wavelength from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , ( table  [ filters ] ) but is always consistent with that of a point source .",
    "monochromatic intensities were obtained by integration of the source flux within a circle of radius 6 pixels ( @xmath14 ) and subtraction of a normalised background measured in a concentric circular ring .",
    "the intensity of mrk  279 in the different filters is listed in table  2 .",
    "the accuracy of these measurements is @xmath15% .",
    "the isophot - s data were reduced with the phot interactive analysis ( pia ; gabriel @xcite ) software package . however , because isophot - s was operating close to its sensitivity limit , special reduction and calibration procedures had to be applied . after a change of illumination , the responsivity of the si : ga photoconductors immediately jumps to an intermediate level .",
    "this initial jump is followed by a characteristic slow transient to the final level . at the faint flux limit ,",
    "this time constant is extremely long , and in practice only the initial step is observed in chopped - mode .",
    "the spectral response function for this particular mode and flux - level was derived directly from observations of a faint standard star hd  132142 whose flux ranges from 0.15 to 2.54 jy .",
    "the calibration star observation was performed with the same chopper frequency and readout - timing as the agn observations .",
    "the @xmath16 of the isophot - s spectra was considerably enhanced by two additional measures : @xmath17 ) the 32-s integration ramps were divided into sub - ramps of 2  sec and no de - glitching ( removal of cosmic ray hits ) was performed at ramp - level @xmath18 ) after slope - fitting and de - glitching at slope - level , the maximum of the distribution of the slopes was determined by fitting a gaussian to the histogram .",
    "the resulting isophot - s fluxes are accurate to within @xmath19  % .    the 1996 february 5 pht - s spectrum is shown in fig .  [ feb05 ] , together with the monochromatic intensities measured with isocam on the same day . each pht - s data - point is shown with its formal error as propagated by the pia software . the cam and pht - s fluxes agree to better than @xmath19% , providing further confidence in the reliability of the flux calibration .",
    "[ irmeasure ]    for each epoch of observation the continuum flux was measured over two different intervals , at short wavelengths ( sw : 2.54.7 ) and long wavelengths ( lw : 5.89.9 ) . table  [ lcur ] lists the mean intensities over these intervals and their uncertainties , while the light curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ lcplot ] .",
    "an accurate determination of the flux uncertainties is essential when discussing source variability .",
    "we have therefore investigated the different source of errors which could potentially affect our pht - s measurement .",
    "[ stabil ]    in staring mode , the overall responsivity of pht - s is known to remain stable within @xmath20% ( schulz 1999 ) .",
    "we have assessed the stability of the pht - s responsivity more specifically at the time of each of the mrk  279 observations and verified that no other systematic effects were present . for this purpose ,",
    "two different types of calibration measurements were used as diagnostic :    1 .",
    "the detector dark current measurements , which are obtained immediately prior to each pht - s observation : throughout the campaign , the dark current signal retained its nominal value of @xmath4 zero @xmath21 .",
    "we can therefore be confident that none of the mrk  279 observations suffered from detector remanence induced by a prior exposure to a bright source .",
    "2 .   measurements with an internal calibration source which are carried - out systematically at the beginning of each iso revolution : averaged over all pixels , the variations of detector responsivity from epoch to epoch are @xmath22% , with upper limits of 3% and 5% in the sw and lw range , respectively .",
    "a conservative upper limit of @xmath19% was thus adopted for the _ systematic _ uncertainty on the pht - s fluxes of mrk  279 .",
    "internal measurement errors were added in quadrature to this systematic uncertainty .",
    "the internal errors were computed as the dispersion about the mean flux in the sw and lw integration intervals , after normalization of the spectra .",
    "the purpose of the normalization is to remove the spectral curvature .",
    "each spectrum was first divided by its best - fit power - law continuum ( @xmath23 ergs@xmath24@xmath25hz@xmath24 ; see  [ irspe ] ) and the rms deviations were computed .",
    "the results show that the internal errors associated with each flux measurement are of 2.8% and 1.7% for the 2.52 - 4.70  and 5.76 - 9.89  bands , respectively .    as a consistency check ,",
    "errors were also computed by comparing pht - s fluxes obtained within 30 days from each others .",
    "this gives a conservative error estimate since it assumes that there are no flux variations on time scales shorter than 30 days .",
    "taking every pair of fluxes within 30 days and measuring the error on their means , we get mean relative errors of 3.5% and 1.6% for the sw and lw bands , respectively .",
    ".pht - s observation log and fluxes [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of mrk  279 shows a strong power - law continuum of spectral index @xmath26 , with weak pah emission bands and no detectable silicate @xmath27 feature .",
    "the mid - ir bump of mrk  279 extends over which @xmath28 exceeds one third of its peak value . ] from roughly 1.25  to 1520  and is wider than a single blackbody .",
    "it peaks near @xmath29 . in fairall  9 ,",
    "the mid - ir bump most likely originates from the re - processing of uv and optical photons by nuclear dust (  1 ) . we can estimate the distance to the central source of the innermost and hottest dust grains in mrk  279 , @xmath7 , by scaling directly from fairall  9 ( clavel et al .",
    "mrk  279 is approximately eight times less luminous than fairall  9 . since the inner radius of the dust distribution is presumably controlled by sublimation",
    ", @xmath7 should scale approximately as @xmath30 , so @xmath7 should be a factor of @xmath31 smaller in mrk  279 than in fairall  9 , i.e. @xmath32  light - days .    during the iso campaign ,",
    "the mid - ir flux did not experience variations of amplitude larger than 10% , the detection limit of the pht - s instrument .",
    "optical data contemporaneous to the ir observations revealed significant fluctuations of the 5100  flux with a relative rms amplitude of 9% and a ratio of the maximum to the minimum fluxes , r@xmath33 .",
    "any upper limit to the mid - ir variability in mrk  279 has to be examined in the light of the uv and optical continuum variations over the same period of time .",
    "as noted earlier , in the dust reprocessing scenario the amplitude of the mir flux variations will be reduced compared to that of the primary uv - optical source because of the finite propagation time of the photons .",
    "imagine a short ( duration @xmath34 day ) pulse of the uv - optical source illuminating a thin dust annulus , inclined by @xmath35 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the annulus ir response will be delayed by @xmath36 and will last for @xmath37 . for numerical values appropriate to mrk  279 ,",
    "the duration of the ir reverberated pulse will be 38 days and its peak amplitude thereby reduced by a factor of order 38 .",
    "given the relatively low amplitude of the optical flux variations ( fig .",
    "[ lcplot ] ) , the absence of measurable variations of the mir flux is consistent with the above scenario .",
    "though a detailed quantitative fit with a particular model is beyond the scope of this paper , it is nevertheless illustrative to perform a qualitative comparison of our data with the theoretical predictions from the torus model by pier & krolik ( 1992 ) .",
    "this model predicts a mid - ir `` bump '' that is approximately 0.7 to 1 decade wide in wavelengths , in agreement with the mrk  279 observations . in the pier & krolik ( 1992 ) model",
    ", the torus emission is expected to peak at a wavelength @xmath38 that depends primarily on the flux illuminating the torus inner surface and its inclination angle @xmath17 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "the relatively high color temperature implied by @xmath39 constrains the inclination to be small ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the absence of silicate absorption also rules - out very optically thick models and constrains the vertical column density at the torus inner edge , @xmath41 .",
    "comparison of fig .",
    "[ sed ] with fig .",
    "5 of pier & krolik ( 1992 ) also suggests a moderately thick torus , with @xmath42 .",
    "the delay @xmath43 t of  w.r.t .",
    "the optical continuum was @xmath44 days during this campaign .",
    "comparison with the results from previous monitoring campaigns ( see table  [ crossc ] ) does not reveal any significant change of @xmath43 t over a time span of @xmath48 years .",
    "in other words , we find no evidence for a secular change in the structure of the blr in mrk  279 .",
    "equating @xmath45 with the emissivity weighted radius @xmath46 of the  emitting region , one sees that @xmath7 is about 8 times larger than @xmath46 . in other words ,",
    "the blr lies well within the dust evaporation radius .",
