    "double charm decays of @xmath2 and @xmath3 provide us with a rich field to study @xmath0 violation and final - state interactions as well as to extract information of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) elements .",
    "@xmath0 asymmetries ( cpas ) in these decays play important roles in testing the standard model ( sm ) as well as exploring new physics ( np ) @xcite .",
    "double charm decays , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are dominated by color - allowed tree @xmath9 transition , but involve small penguin pollution from @xmath10 transition carrying a different weak phase .",
    "the latter contributions lead to direct cpas , which are very small ( about the order of @xmath11 ) in the sm .",
    "if penguin corrections are neglected , the sm predictions for the direct cpas would be zero .",
    "it is interesting to note that both babar and belle have measured the direct cpa in @xmath12 decay @xmath13 respectively .",
    "one would find the difference between the two measurements is @xmath14 _ i.e _ , the difference is as large as @xmath15 .",
    "so far , such a large direct cpa has not been observed in the other measurements of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays @xcite , which involve the same quark level weak decays .",
    "if the large cp violation in @xmath16 from belle is true , it would establish the presence of np . at present",
    "one can not conclude the presence of np in those decays .",
    "equivalently one also can not take the cpas are in agreement with the sm expectations .",
    "recently the large direct cpa in @xmath16 has been investigated with possible np scenarios , such as unparticle interaction @xcite and the np effects in electroweak penguin sector @xcite , and so on .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to investigate @xmath2 and @xmath3 double charm decays systematically in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite with r - parity violation @xcite . in the literature , the possible appearance of the r - parity violating ( rpv ) couplings @xcite , which violate the lepton and/or baryon number conservations , has gained full attention in searching for supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the effects of supersymmetry with r - parity violation in @xmath17 meson decays have been extensively investigated , for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our work ,",
    "twenty - four double charm decays @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are studied in the rpv mssm . for simplicity",
    "we employ naive factorization @xcite for the hadronic dynamics , which is expected to be reliable for the color - allowed amplitudes , which are dominant contributions in those double charm decays .",
    "the color - allowed tree level dominated decays of @xmath9 , @xmath21 @xmath6 , @xmath22 and @xmath8 , involve the same set of rpv coupling constants . for these processes , besides the cpa in @xmath23 ,",
    "a few other observables in @xmath24 have been already measured by babar and belle collaborations @xcite . to derive constraints on the relevant rpv couplings",
    ", we will choose a set of data from the aforementioned measurements which have quite high consistency between the measurements of babar and belle .",
    "then , using the constrained rpv coupling parameter spaces , we predict the rpv effects on the other observables in @xmath6 , @xmath22 and @xmath25 decays , whose measurements from babar and belle are not compatible within @xmath26 error range , and/or which have not been measured yet .",
    "one of our goals is to see how large the direct cpa of @xmath16 can be within the constrained parameter spaces .",
    "we find that the lower limit of @xmath27 could be just slightly decreased by the rpv couplings , and the rpv effects on this quantity are not large enough to explain the large direct @xmath0 violation from belle , although the mixing - induced cpas of @xmath6 are very sensitive to the rpv couplings .",
    "decays @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are governed by the @xmath31 transition at the quark level , and also involve the same set of rpv coupling constants .",
    "they have similar properties to @xmath6 , @xmath22 and @xmath25 decays , nevertheless the penguin effects are less cabibbo - suppressed . for these decays , most branching ratios and one longitudinal polarization have been measured @xcite .",
    "we will take the same strategy as the one for @xmath9 decays to constrain relevant rpv couplings and estimate rpv effects in these decays .",
    "we find that rpv couplings could significantly affect the cpas of these decays , and could flip their signs .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly introduce the theoretical framework for the double charm @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays in the rpv mssm , and we tabulate all the theoretical input parameters . in sec . 3 , we deal with the numerical results and our discussions . at first",
    ", we give the sm predictions with full uncertainties of the input parameters .",
    "then , we derive the constrained parameter spaces which satisfy all the experimental data with high consistency between different collaborations . finally , we predict the rpv effects on other quantities , which have not been measured or have not been well measured yet .",
    "section 4 contains our summary .",
    "in the sm , the low energy effective hamiltonian for @xmath32 transition at a scale @xmath33 is given by @xcite @xmath34 here @xmath35 for @xmath36 transition @xmath37 .",

    "<S> motivated by the possible large direct @xmath0 asymmetry of @xmath1 decay measured by belle collaboration , we investigate double charm @xmath2 and @xmath3 decays in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with r - parity violation . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the bounds on relevant r - parity violating couplings from the current experimental data , which show quite consistent measurements among relative collaborations . using the constrained parameter spaces , we explore r - parity violating effects on other observables in these decays , which have not been measured or have not been well measured yet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the r - parity violating effects on the mixing - induced @xmath0 asymmetries of @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays could be very large , nevertheless the r - parity violating effects on the direct @xmath0 asymmetries could not be large enough to explain the large direct @xmath0 violation of @xmath1 from belle . </S>",
    "<S> our results could be used to probe r - parity violating effects and will correlate with searches for direct r - parity violating signals in future experiments .    </S>",
