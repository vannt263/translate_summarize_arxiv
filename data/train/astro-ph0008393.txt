    "1998 ) , is of special interest since its properties suggest it is a massive ( @xmath3 ) black hole . in this context ,",
    "the unusually strong iron fluorescent emission detected at 6.4 kev near sgr a * , particularly from the sgr  b2 giant molecular cloud located some @xmath4 pc away , has raised some interesting questions regarding its origin and its possible diagnostic value for understanding the high - energy behavior of the central engine .",
    "the gc is characterized by the presence of giant molecular clouds having mean volume densities of @xmath5 and gas temperatures on the order of 60  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray observations of this region carried out by @xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and @xmath7sax ( @xcite ) have revealed a source of bright fe fluorescent k@xmath1 line radiation within sgr  b2 , whose radius is @xmath8 pc and whose total enclosed mass is @xmath9 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this fluorescent emission has a very large equivalent width ( @xmath10 kev ) and a peak around 6.4 kev .",
    "the surrounding continuum is quite flat , and shows strong absorption below @xmath11 kev and a sharp iron k@xmath1 absorption feature at @xmath12 kev .",
    "the large equivalent width is key to understanding the nature of the fluorescent emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray fluorescence is due to illumination of cloud material by an x - ray source . for a steady source embedded within a gaseous cloud , an upper limit to the equivalent width",
    "is @xmath13 kev ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , rather insensitive to the parameters chosen .",
    "therefore , in the case of sgr  b2 , we are necessarily dealing with either a source external to the cloud or a time - dependent internal source whose flux has diminished , allowing the continuum to fade away relative to the line intensity . an additional argument in favor of a time - dependent illuminator is currently the absence of any bright x - ray source in the vicinity of sgr  b2 with sufficient luminosity to produce the observed fluorescence ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; it seems that the illuminating object , whether internal or external to the cloud , must have undergone a decrease in x - ray flux to its current quiescent state . certainly , the sigma survey of this region ( vargas et al .",
    "1996 ) has indicated that several sources may remain difficult to detect due to their overall faintness and variable behavior .",
    "it is tempting to invoke sgr a * as the external illuminator of sgr  b2 , which would then provide some measure of its recent variability at x - ray energies .",
    "motivated by the sgr  b2 spectral characteristics and the source morphology , which show that the emission is strongest on the side of the cloud closest to sgr  a * , murakami et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested that we may be witnessing evidence of the black hole s activity some @xmath0 years ago ( the light travel time from the nucleus to sgr  b2 ) .",
    "these authors modeled a reflection spectrum using approximations for the photon transfer equations and obtained a decent fit to the observed spectrum .",
    "however , it is important to note that this modeling is only a rough approximation , neglecting multiple thomson scatterings and assuming isotropic reflection .",
    "it is also limited by the fact that it does not explore the possibility that the x - ray sources are internal to the cloud or that they are time - dependent , which would provide important comparative results for fully testing the idea that sgr a * was the transient high - energy source illuminating the fluorescing region .",
    "there are several reasons for taking a skeptical view of sgr a * as the x - ray illuminator .",
    "first and foremost , this would require a change in its x - ray luminosity by a factor of about @xmath14 in @xmath0 hundred years ( from @xmath15 erg s@xmath16 , @xcite , to the currently observed value of @xmath17 erg s@xmath16 ) .",
    "secondly , we are reminded of the fact that no other molecular cloud in the region , with the exception of the sgr  a shell , displays any significant fe k@xmath1 emission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of the sgr  a shell ,",
    "the k@xmath1 line has a much smaller equivalent width ( @xmath18 ev ) , easily explained by , e.g. , a steady x - ray source embedded within the cloud .",
    "it is therefore our intention in this _ letter _ to explore alternative scenarios for the illumination of sgr  b2 , using time - dependent x - ray sources both internal and external to the cloud , with monte carlo methods to accurately model the spectrum .",
    "to simulate the x - ray spectrum formed under a wide range of conditions , we use a modified version of leahy & creighton s ( 1983 ) ` monte.f ` code .",
    "we have rewritten this algorithm , originally designed to handle a time - steady photon transfer from internal sources , to allow for blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung continua , a time - dependence due to non - steady illuminators , and the presence of both internal and external x - ray sources .",
    "a very important addition is that the escaping photons are now convolved with the @xmath6 gis response function and assigned to actual @xmath6 gis energy bins ( rather than arbitrary logarithmic energy intervals ) , enabling a direct comparison with the actual data .",
    "the photon propagation within the cloud , including the effects of electron scattering , absorption , and fluorescence , is handled as in ` monte.f ` ( c.f .",
    "@xcite for a full description ) .",
    "in particular , the bound - free absorption cross - sections are taken from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) , the elemental abundances are from dalgarno & layzer ( 1987 ) , and the fluorescence yields are those given by bambynek et al .",
    "( 1972 ) .    for blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung",
    "spectra the photon distribution function @xmath19 is too complex to allow direct monte carlo sampling .",
    "instead , we use rejection methods described in press et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to generate photons .",
    "we choose a simpler function @xmath20 ( called the _ comparison function _ ) such that it lies above @xmath19 everywhere within the relevant range of energies .",
    "the comparison function is sampled using standard monte carlo techniques to determine an energy @xmath21 . if @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are pre - defined lower and upper energy bounds , we multiply @xmath25 by a standard deviate @xmath26 . when @xmath27 we accept the result and a photon is generated with energy @xmath21 .",
    "if not , we reject the result and repeat the process until conditions ( [ eq : e_prime ] ) and ( [ eq : photon_gen ] ) are satisfied .",

    ", we create all photons at time @xmath40 and track their travel time between interactions within the cloud . upon the last interaction , an additional time @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the location of the photon at last interaction and @xmath43 is the directional vector of the escaping photon , is added to each photon .",
    "this factor represents the geometrical time lag for an escaping photon to reach the observer ; similar lags appear in , e.g. , reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei ( @xcite ) .",
    "escaping photons are then assigned to time bins of width @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the cloud radius , with spectra being constructed for each of these time bins .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume that sgr  b2 is a uniform spherical cloud ; its optical depth and elemental abundances are allowed to vary , as well as the shape of the illuminating x - ray spectrum and the source location .",
    "the flux density is also kept as a free parameter , since fixing this would require further assumptions about the nature of the x - ray source , which is not necessary for the modeling we describe here .",
    "we consider both internal and external sources .",
    "the former are assumed to lie at the center of the cloud and to emit isotropically , therefore maintaining spherical symmetry .",
    "the escaping photons are binned only in time , as there is no need for angular bins due to the isotropy .",
    "the external sources are assumed to lie at a distance much greater than the radius of the cloud , so that incoming photon distribution is roughly plane parallel .",
    "the cloud is located with its center at the origin , and photons are incident from @xmath46-axis .",
    "they enter the sphere at polar angle @xmath47 , where @xmath26 is a random deviate chosen for each photon ; the azimuthal angle @xmath48 is chosen randomly for each photon .",
    "each incident photon is assigned an initial time @xmath49 , representing the geometrical time lag for the photon to reach the sphere s surface . as spherical symmetry",
    "has been broken , escaping photons are binned in @xmath50 ; we typically use four @xmath50 bins of width @xmath51 each .",
    "azimuthal symmetry is retained , so no @xmath48 binning is necessary .",
    "the modeled spectra are compared to the background - subtracted data of murakami et al .",
    "these observations were made using @xmath6 during october 1993 and september 1994 .",
    "the escaping photons are convolved with the @xmath6 gis response function and binned according to the observed energy intervals .",
    "each model run consists of several million photons , and the spectra are constructed for each time and @xmath50 bin .",
    "in this section , we describe illustrative ( reasonable ) fits to the data . because there is a wide range of parameter values giving acceptable results and because the results are sensitive to , e.g. , our selection of time and angular bin boundaries , it is not yet worthwhile attempting to make a best fit , which is unlikely to be the `` unique '' solution .",
    "in addition , our use of a cold emitting gas appears to be lacking a key ingredient of the observed emission ( c.f .",
    ", section  [ sec : discussion ] ) , making a best - fit analysis premature .",
    "an internal source must have a spectrum that drops off steeply at higher energies in order to explain the observed flat continuum .",
    "this is because the absorption cross - section decreases at higher energies ; there must be fewer incident photons at these energies in order for the escaping continuum to remain flat .",
    "we find that blackbody and thermal bremsstrahlung sources , with their exponential cut - offs , provide decent fits to the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : internal ] shows reasonable fits for blackbody ( left ) and thermal bremsstrahlung ( right ) internal sources . in both cases",
    ", we used a cloud optical depth of @xmath52 and elemental abundances enhanced to three times the local ism values .",
    "the blackbody and bremsstrahlung illuminating spectra have @xmath53 kev and @xmath54 kev , respectively , and both have been allowed to evolve over time .",
    "the output spectra illustrated here are those that would be observed at time @xmath55 ( blackbody ) and @xmath56 ( bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "note that the first photons escape the sphere at @xmath57 .",
    "the fits lack an emission component at @xmath58 kev . for these models ,",
    "we obtain @xmath59 ( 33 d.o.f . ) for the blackbody and @xmath60 ( 33 d.o.f . ) for the bremsstrahlung illuminators .      unlike the case of the internal sources , where the illuminator must apparently have a time - dependent luminosity",
    ", we find that both time - steady and time - dependent external sources provide good fits to the data .",
    "the best fits have incident spectra with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 , although there is much leeway here .",
    "we note that for @xmath63 , thermal bremsstrahlung spectra have @xmath64 , so a hot , external bremsstrahlung source is certainly a possibility .",
    "figure  [ fig : external ] shows reasonable fits for time - steady ( left ) and time - dependent ( right ) external sources . in both models , we used @xmath65 , a cloud optical depth of @xmath66 , and elemental abundances enhanced to three times the local ism values .",
    "the spectra plotted are for @xmath67 , although the @xmath68 spectra are nearly as good . in the time - dependent model we are looking at the spectrum formed during the period @xmath69 , which is early in the time - evolution and therefore ( not surprisingly ) quite similar to the time - steady case .",
    "the fits appear to be slightly better than those of the internal models , with @xmath70 ( 33 d.o.f . ) for the steady source and @xmath71 ( 33 d.o.f . ) for the time - dependent source .",
    "although not as apparent here , these spectra also lack an emission component at @xmath58 kev .",
    "we have shown that the bulk of the iron fluorescent emission can be explained by either internal or external x - ray sources , though internal sources must be time - dependent ; over time the line - emission becomes stronger relative to the continuum , giving an @xmath72 approaching the observed value .",
    "external sources may be time - steady or time - dependent , as it is possible to obtain a large @xmath72 by angular selection effects .",
    "however , a time - steady illuminator may be unlikely due to the current lack of an obvious source near sgr b2 , with the possible exception of 1e 1743.1 - 2843 , which lies only 63 pc ( in projection ) away ( e.g. , murakami et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the fact that internal sources are viable illuminators for the fluorescence in sgr  b2 is due in part to the limited energy resolution of the _ asca _ gis detector .",
    "although the equivalent width of the fe 6.4 kev line is smaller for an internal source than for an external illuminator , this situation changes when the calculated spectrum is convolved with the detector response function .",
    "it is evident from figures 1 and 2 that both internal and external sources give reasonable fits to the data .",
    "thus future observations , e.g. , with _ xmm _ , can in principle distinguish between these two types of sources and help resolve the question of whether the iron line fluorescent emission in sgr  b2 does indeed indicate a past high - energy activity in sgr a*.    all the calculations reported here lack an emission component at @xmath58 kev .",
    "it is possible that the appearance of this spectral feature is simply an artifact due to an incomplete background subtraction ( since the sgr  b2 background is very inhomogeneous ) .",
    "if it is real , however , it may indicate emission from `` warm '' iron species ( c.f . , @xcite ) , in an ionization state or greater . based on ionization calculations carried out with cloudy ( @xcite )",
    ", we find that these `` warm '' species exist only at temperatures on the order of @xmath73 k. gas at these high temperatures is unlikely to coexist with the cold cloud material , so one possibility is that it constitutes a transition layer between sgr  b2 and the hot ( @xmath74 k ) plasma surrounding it .",
    "however , thermal conduction models seem to suggest that such a layer would be too thin to produce significant emission ( @xcite ) . future observations may provide better clues to this puzzle .",
    "we thank hiroshi murakami for providing the @xmath6 gis data .",
    "we also thank rashid sunyaev , lara sidoli and sandro mereghetti for their helpful discussions .",
