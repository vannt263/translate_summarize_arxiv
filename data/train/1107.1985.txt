    "<S> the cross section for em processes exceeds the hadronic cross section by several order of magnitude ( see  @xcite for updated predictions ) . </S>",

    "<S> for heavy nuclei single neutron ( 1n ) emission is the main decay mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the emitted neutrons have a rapidity close to the beam one , therefore the zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) are ideal devices for their detection . </S>",
    "<S> the alice experiment has two neutron zdcs ( zns ) , placed on both sides relative to the interaction point ( ip ) , about 114  m away from it . </S>",
