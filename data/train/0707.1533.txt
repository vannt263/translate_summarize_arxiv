    "dwarf galaxies ( dgs ) are the most numerous galaxies occurring in the universe .",
    "a majority of galaxies in the local group are dgs @xcite . also dgs comprise 85% of the local volume galaxy population ( @xmath0 mpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and have been seen in observations of nearby galaxy clusters , coma @xcite , virgo @xcite , fornax @xcite , centaurus @xcite , and several galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "dgs may have a space density @xmath1 times that of bright galaxies in the universe @xcite .",
    "dgs are defined as low - mass ( @xmath2 ) galaxies having an absolute magnitude fainter than @xmath3 mag , or @xmath4 mag @xcite , have low surface brightness and low metallicity .",
    "their small stellar fraction and very low luminosities make them the hardest galaxies to detect .",
    "they are believed to be the single systems with the largest proportion of dark - matter , and have a correspondingly high ratio of dark to luminous mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with @xmath5 ratios as high as that of galaxy groups and poor clusters .",
    "due to their smaller masses and gravitational potentials , dgs are less able to retain their gas as compared to more massive galaxies , and in a clustered environment , the dgs are more likely to be disrupted by galactic encounters and environmental effects .    in the hierarchical clustering scenario of structure formation in the universe ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the accretion of dgs causes the build up and growth of massive galaxies and large - scale structures .",
    "there exists a deficiency in the number of observed low - luminosity dgs ( discrepancy more than one order of magnitude ) as compared to the large number of theoretically predicted low - mass dark matter halos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is recognized as a problem for cold dark matter theory , and the likely solution to this problem involves energy feedback from stellar evolution .",
    "dense clusters are observed to contain a larger number of low - luminosity dgs per high - luminosity giant galaxy when compared to the field .",
    "@xcite found that the virgo cluster contains @xmath6 times more dwarf galaxies per giant galaxy when compared to the ursa major cluster .",
    "these imply that dwarfs are more common relative to giants in dense environments than diffuse ones .",
    "the dynamical evolution of galaxies in a cluster is influenced by several mechanisms .",
    "there are two types of tidal interactions : the tidal forces due to other ( massive ) cluster galaxies @xcite , and the tidal field resulting from the overall cluster potential @xcite .",
    "there can be collisions between the galaxies themselves due to their motion , sometimes resulting in mergers .",
    "of particular interest is the occurrence of multiple high - velocity encounters between cluster galaxies @xcite , a phenomenon which is termed `` galaxy harassment '' @xcite .",
    "a phenomenon like tidal stirring ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where tidal shocks strip dgs ) has a more pronounced effect on the less massive galaxies .",
    "there can also be stripping within galaxy groups and protoclusters accreting onto a cluster @xcite .",
    "works are found in the literature on the interaction of cluster environment with dgs in the cluster .",
    "studying the core of the fornax cluster , @xcite examined a scenario in which dgs are accreted and dissolved at the cluster center .",
    "they found that the infall of dgs can largely explain many properties , but there are probably other physical processes occurring simultaneously , like the evolution of the more massive galaxies by stripping and merging .",
    "@xcite performed analytical and hydrodynamic studies of the interaction between the icm of a cluster and an extended gas component of dgs surrounded by a cold dark matter halo .",
    "they found that the dg halos lose their diffuse gas rapidly by ram - pressure stripping in a typical cluster environment .",
    "the diffuse intracluster light ( icl ) observed in clusters of galaxies is produced by stars , usually of low surface brightness , located outside individual galaxies but within the cluster and associated with the cluster potential .",
    "the first mention of ic light was made by @xcite , who observed extended irregular regions of stars and low surface - brightness matter in the intergalactic spaces of the coma cluster .",
    "several observations have since detected diffuse light in galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "diffuse icl has been observed in many galaxy cluster systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including non - cd galaxy clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "observations of diffuse icl in virgo @xcite reveal complex substructures in intricate web patterns including long tidal streamers , small tidal tails , and intergalactic bridges .",
    "the idea of ic globular clusters was proposed by @xcite .",
    "later on , distinct ic stars were observed , including globular clusters , red giant stars , and sn ia @xcite .",
    "individual ic stars have been found in virgo @xcite , and coma @xcite .",
    "deep broadband imaging has helped to observe icl in several other local galaxy clusters , e.g. , cantaurus , fornax , abell , and clusters up to intermediate redshifts .",
    "the origin and evolution of the ic stars and diffuse light are not well constrained at present .",
    "arguably these field stars are gravitationally stripped from their parent galaxies when the galaxies in a cluster interact dynamically with other galaxies or with the cluster potential .",
    "continuous accumulation of icl is now believed to be an ubiquitous feature of evolved galaxy clusters , with the unbound ( i.e. intracluster ) star fraction slowly increasing with time . from observations and cosmological simulations , at @xmath7 at least @xmath8 of all stars in a cluster are unbound to any one galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as an upper limit , icl constitute @xmath9 of a cluster s luminosity . in observations and simulations ,",
    "the fraction of stars in icl increases with mass of the clusters , and increases with density of environment : from loose groups ( @xmath10 , @xcite ) , to virgo - like ( 10% , @xcite ) and rich clusters ( @xmath11 or higher , @xcite ) . in the cores of dense and rich clusters ( like coma )",
    "the local icl fraction can be as high as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the most popular formation mechanism of ic population is stripping of stars from cluster galaxies by gravitational tides , fast encounters between galaxies , and tidal interactions between colliding and merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "another contribution to the ic population can come from the infall of galaxy protoclusters containing stars which are already unbound .",
    "studies of ic stars in the virgo cluster @xcite imply that bulk of the ic stars come from late - type galaxies and dwarf galaxies , and that the ic stars form by tidal stripping .",
    "optical studies of icl in intermediate redshift clusters @xcite support that icl is produced by stripping and disruption of galaxies when they pass through cluster centers . a dominant mechanism of icl formation",
    "is believed to be tidal stripping during the hierarchical assembly of clusters .",
    "several authors have studied the origin of the diffuse icl in clusters of galaxies using numerical simulation .",
    "@xcite performed high - resolution n - body @xmath13cdm simulations of a virgo - like cluster to study the velocity and clustering properties of the ic stellar component at @xmath14 .",
    "the member galaxies in their simulated cluster undergo tidal interactions among themselves and with the cluster potential , to produce diffuse stars in the icm .",
    "their results substantially agree with the observed clustering properties of the diffuse ic stars in virgo . using hydrodynamical simulation of a ( 192 @xmath15 mpc)@xmath16 cosmological box ,",
    "@xcite studied the statistical properties of ic stars in galaxy clusters and the dependence of the icl properties on cluster mass and temperature .",
    "their simulations reveal substantial ( at least @xmath17 ) diffuse stellar light in a cluster , hidden from observations because of its very low surface brightness . using high - resolution n - body + sph simulations of a coma - like cluster formed in a cosmological context , @xcite studied the formation , evolution and properties of ic stars in a rich cluster .",
    "their results indicate that both massive and smaller galaxies contribute to icl formation , with the stars stripped preferentially from the outer , lower - metallicity parts of a galaxy s stellar distribution .",
    "the resulting fraction ( @xmath18 at @xmath19 ) , and distribution of ic stars are in good agreement with the observed icl properties .",
    "@xcite performed cosmological treesph simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxy groups and clusters , in order to discuss the icl properties .",
    "they simulated a virgo - like and a coma - like cluster , and 4 galaxy groups , and predict several properties of ic stellar populations .",
    "@xcite have used @xmath20-body simulations ( done at both low and high resolutions ) of the dynamical evolution of galaxy clusters to study the formation and evolution of the diffuse icl component in 3 simulated galaxy clusters .",
    "they found that the icl fraction of cluster luminosity increases as clusters evolve , reaching @xmath21 in evolved clusters .",
    "in these numerical studies , there is always a trade - off between having good resolution or good statistics .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite simulate either one cluster or a few clusters , so even though their simulations have high resolution , they have poor statistics , in the sense that the cluster(s ) they are simulating might not be representative of the whole cluster population . at the other extreme ,",
    "@xcite simulate a very large cosmological volume , containing a statistically significant sample of clusters .",
    "such large simulations however can not resolve the scale of dwarf galaxies .",
    "our goal is to have it both ways : achieving good statistics while resolving the processes responsible for destroying dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is achieved by combining large - scale cosmological simulations with a semi - analytical treatment of mergers and tidal disruption .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to determine if dwarf galaxies in clusters are more prone to destruction by tides or to destruction by mergers .",
    "this determination is then used to predict the contribution of dwarf galaxies to the origin of intracluster stars in different types of cluster environments .",
    "the dgs in a cluster can be tidally disrupted ( by the field of a more massive galaxy or by the background halo , ) or the dgs can be destroyed when they merge with another galaxy .",
    "the impact of these two destruction mechanisms on the icl is radically different . in the case of tidal disruption",
    ", the process contributes to ic stars in the cluster . in the case of merger ,",
    "the dg is absorbed by a more massive galaxy , and there is essentially no contribution to the ic stars .",
    "for the first part of this project , presented in this paper , we perform numerical simulations of isolated clusters of galaxies , in order to examine which method of dwarf galaxy destruction is dominant , and how the process depends on environmental factors .",
    "we identify six possible outcomes for our simulated galaxies : ( 1 ) the galaxy merges with another galaxy , ( 2 ) the galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of a larger galaxy but the fragments accrete onto that larger galaxy , ( 3 ) the galaxy is destroyed by tides and the fragments are dispersed in the intracluster medium ( icm ) , contributing to the intracluster light , ( 4 ) the galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of the background halo , ( 5 ) the galaxy survives to the present , and ( 6 ) the galaxy is ejected from the cluster .",
    "we designed a simple algorithm to follow the evolution of galaxies in an isolated cluster .",
    "the gravitational interaction between galaxies is calculated by a direct n - body algorithm .",
    "the other physical mechanisms governing the possible outcomes ( mergers , tidal disruption , accretion etc . ) of the simulated galaxies are treated as `` subgrid physics , '' and are incorporated in the algorithm using a semi - analytical method . in the present work , we use this algorithm to simulate the evolution of isolated galaxy clusters , i.e. we assume that the cluster has already formed with its constituent galaxies in place , and it is neither accreting nor merging .",
    "cluster accretion possibly has a finite impact on the evolution of dwarf galaxies , and on the origin of intracluster stars . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    "we will address these issues by doing actual cosmological simulations over a statistically significant volume of the universe .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec - numerical ] we outline the numerical model for our galaxy clusters .",
    "the methodology of our simulations is described in ",
    "[ sec - simulations ] .",
    "the results are presented in  [ sec - results ] and  [ sec - dependence ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of our main goals in  [ sec - discussion ] , and give our conclusions in  [ sec - conclusion ] .",
    "we treat the system as an isolated cluster consisting of @xmath20 galaxies of mass @xmath22 , radius @xmath23 , and internal energy @xmath24 , orbiting inside a background halo of uncollapsed dark matter and gas .",
    "we assume that the halo is spherically symmetric , and its radial density profile @xmath25 does not evolve with time ( hence , we are neglecting infall motion that would result from cooling flows ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the halo is stationary : it does not respond to the forces exerted on it by the galaxies , and therefore its center remains fixed at a point that we take to be the origin .",
    "we represent each galaxy by _ one single particle _ of mass @xmath22 .",
    "the `` radius '' @xmath23 of the galaxy and its `` internal energy '' @xmath24 are internal variables that only enter in the treatment of the subgrid physics described in ",
    "[ sec : subgrid ] below .",
    "our motivation for using this approach is the following : to simulate the destruction of dwarf galaxies by tides , it would seem more appropriate to simulate each galaxy using many particles .",
    "supposing , however , that it takes at least 100 particles to properly resolve a dwarf galaxy experiencing tidal destruction , as the galaxies in our simulations cover 3 orders of magnitude in mass , the most massive ones would be represented by 100,000 particles .",
    "even though the dwarf galaxies are much more numerous than the massive ones , the total number of particles would be above 1 million .",
    "this raises the following issues :    * with the use of tree codes , an @xmath26-particle simulation is not considered prohibitive anymore .",
    "however ( 1 ) our model has several free parameters , so we have a full parameter - space to study , and ( 2 ) one single cluster is not statistically significant , so for each combination of parameters we need to perform several simulations . for this paper , we performed simulations .",
    "doing million - particle simulations would start to be computationally expensive .",
    "* we could use unequal - mass particles , so that the most massive galaxies would not be represented by large numbers of particles .",
    "this is usually not a good idea .",
    "n - body simulations with particles having wildly different masses are known to suffer from all sorts of instability problems , which often require special algorithms to deal with .",
    "the approach we are considering here is more practical . * in this paper , we consider isolated clusters . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we will present simulations of a cosmological volume containing at least 100 clusters . the number of particles would then reach 100 million , and",
    "we would still need to explore the parameter space .",
    "this would be very computationally expensive .",
    "we will solve this problem using single - particle galaxies combined with a treatment of subgrid physics .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper can be seen as a test - bed for this approach .",
    "the relatively small number of particles in our simulations ( typically less than 1,000 ) enables us to use a direct , particle - particle ( pp ) algorithm , which is the simplest of all n - body algorithms .",
    "we took a standard pp code , which evolves a system of @xmath20 gravitationally interacting particles using a second - order runge - kutta algorithm .",
    "we modified the original algorithm to include the interaction with the background halo , and we added several modules to deal with the subgrid physics . in this modified algorithm ,",
    "the number of particles @xmath20 can vary , as they merge , are destroyed by tides , or escape the cluster .",
    "the acceleration of particle @xmath27 ( or galaxy @xmath27 ) is given by @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the positions of particles @xmath27 and @xmath31 , respectively , @xmath32 is the mass of particle @xmath31 , @xmath33 is the mass of the background halo inside @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath36 is the softening length .",
    "this assumes that the background cluster halo is spherically symmetric and centered at the origin . in our pp algorithm , this expression is evaluated directly , by summing over all particles @xmath37 . the softening length @xmath36 is chosen to be smaller than the initial radius of the smallest galaxies ( see  3.2 below for the determination of the initial radius ) .",
    "we evolve the system forward in time using a second - order runge kutta algorithm .",
    "the timestep @xmath38 is calculated using @xmath39\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 is the velocity of particle @xmath27 , and we take the smallest value of @xmath41 to be the timestep @xmath38 .",
    "we consider two different types of density profile of the background halo of a cluster , @xmath42 : the @xmath43 profile , and the nfw profile .    in the first case , we assume that the dark matter in the background halo follows a similar density distribution as the observed intracluster gas . a single @xmath43-model ( isothermal ) density profile is used for the gas ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath44^{-3\\beta/2},\\ ] ] where , @xmath45 is the central density , and @xmath46 is the core radius .",
    "the values of @xmath47 , @xmath46 and @xmath43 are taken from @xcite , which gives the gas density parameters for 16 nearby clusters .",
    "the halo density is then obtained by scaling the gas density with the universal ratio of matter ( dark + baryonic ) to baryons , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the present matter ( baryons + dark matter ) density parameter and baryon density parameter , respectively .",
    "this assumes that the cluster baryon mass fraction follows the cosmic value of @xmath51 , which is expected to be generally true ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although precise estimations of cluster baryon content have shown deviations from the universal value ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    in a second case",
    ", we consider that the distribution of gas and dark matter in the background halo both follow analytical models of the dark matter density having a functional form @xmath52 @xcite .",

    "the nfw profile is often parametrized in terms of a concentration parameter @xmath55 .",
    "the parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are then given by @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the critical density at formation redshift @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , the virial radius , is the radius of a sphere whose mean density is @xmath60 ( 200 times the critical density of the universe at the epoch of formation ) . after scaling",
    ", the halo density profile is @xmath61 .",
    "once we have chosen a particular density profile , the density is integrated to get the background cluster halo mass as @xmath62    this is the mass that enters in the last term of equation  ( [ gravity ] ) .",
    "since the density profiles we consider do not have an outer edge where @xmath63 , we truncate the cluster background halo at a maximum halo radius @xmath64 . equation  ( [ mhalo ] ) is then solved numerically , to build an interpolation table for @xmath65 in the range @xmath66 $ ] that is then used by the code .      as mentioned in  [ sec - objectives ] , there can be six possible physical outcomes for our simulated cluster galaxies . in the following subsections ,",
    "we describe the associated subgrid physics for each mechanism we use in our simulations .",
    "the possible outcomes are : ( 1 ) the galaxy merges with another galaxy (  [ sec - merger ] ) , ( 2 ) the galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of a larger galaxy but the fragments accrete onto that larger galaxy (  [ sec - tideaccr ] ) , ( 3 ) the galaxy is destroyed by tides of a larger galaxy and the fragments are dispersed in the intracluster medium (  [ sec - tideicl ] ) , ( 4 ) the galaxy is destroyed by the tidal field of the background halo (  [ sec - tideicl ] ) , ( 5 ) the galaxy survives to the present ( i.e. , it is not destroyed by any process ) , and ( 6 ) the galaxy is ejected from the cluster (  [ sec - eject ] ) .",
    "we describe our approach of simulating galaxy harassment in  [ sec - harass ] .",
    "we simulate a pair of galaxies colliding ( or synonymously , having an encounter ) and the further consequences ( e.g. , merging ) in the following way .",
    "an encounter is accounted for when two galaxies @xmath27 and @xmath31 , of radii @xmath23 and @xmath67 , overlap such that the center of the galaxy @xmath31 is inside the galaxy @xmath27 .",
    "numerically the criterion is @xmath68 , where , @xmath69 is the distance between the centers of the galaxies . if @xmath40 and @xmath70 are the velocities of galaxies @xmath27 and @xmath31 , the center of mass velocity of the pair is @xmath71 .",
    "the kinetic energy in the center - of - mass rest frame is @xmath72    even though we are treating each galaxy as a single particle , in reality a galaxy is a gravitationally bound system with an internal kinetic energy and a potential energy , and these energies must be included in the total energy of the interacting pair of galaxies .",
    "considering a galaxy as a bound virialized system its internal energy is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is a geometrical factor which depends on the mass distribution in the galaxies . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath75 ( see appendix a ) .",
    "we then compute the total energy of the galaxy pair ( in the center of mass frame ) as @xmath76 if @xmath77 , i.e. , the system is bound , we then allow the galaxies to merge to form a single galaxy of mass @xmath78 . to compute its radius ,",
    "we assume that energy is conserved , hence the total energy @xmath79 in the center - of - mass rest frame is all converted into the internal energy of the merger remnant .",
    "its radius is then computed from equation  ( [ internal ] ) , @xmath80 the position and velocity of this merged object are set to those of the center - of - mass values of the galaxy pair before merger , in order to conserve momentum .      in a high - speed encounter",
    "the two interacting galaxies come into contact for a brief amount of time .",
    "the galaxies might survive a merger or tidal disruption , but the encounter adds some internal energy into them , making them less bound .",
    "we refer to this process as _",
    "galaxy harassment_. this process has been originally suggested as a possible explanation for the origin of the morphology - density relation in clusters @xcite .",
    "we incorporate galaxy harassment in our algorithm by increasing the radius ( or the internal energy ) of a galaxy when it experiences a non - merger encounter .",
    "this enlargement makes a galaxy more prone to tidal disruption at a next encounter .    in equation  ( [ e - pair ] ) , if @xmath81 , i.e. , the system is not bound , then the galaxies in our simulation do not merge in the collision . rather a part of the kinetic energy of the galaxies is converted into internal energy , making the collision inelastic .",
    "we assume that an equal amount of energy is transfered to each galaxy . denoting",
    "the energy transfered as @xmath82 , the kinetic energy of the pair decreases by @xmath82 , while the internal energy of each galaxy increases by @xmath83 .",
    "we assume @xmath84 where @xmath85 is an energy transfer efficiency whose value is taken as @xmath86 .",
    "the internal energies of the two galaxies after the encounter are @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively . by choosing @xmath89",
    ", we are ensuring that the internal energy of each galaxy remains negative , that is , the transfer of energy does not unbind the galaxies .",
    "we recalculate the velocities @xmath40 and @xmath70 after collision while conserving momentum , assuming that only the magnitudes of velocity change , the directions remaining the same .",
    "we recalculate the size of each galaxy in the pair using equation  ( [ s_merged ] ) , @xmath90    while allowing a size increase of the galaxies according to equations  ( [ s_merged ] ) and ( [ s_ij_after ] ) , we also considered a size cutoff .",
    "we assumed that the galaxies could grow only up to a maximum size given by the size of the largest galaxy at the beginning of the simulation .       on a galaxy of mass @xmath32 and radius @xmath67",
    "the two largest arrows show the gravitational accelerations caused by galaxy @xmath27 ; the two smallest arrows show the accelerations caused by galaxy @xmath31 .",
    "see  [ sec - tideicl ] for details.,width=336 ]    we consider two possible sources of external gravitation for the tidal disruption of a galaxy @xmath31 : another galaxy @xmath27 , or the background cluster halo .",
    "the tidal force on a galaxy due to the gravitational field of the external source is meaningful only if the galaxy lies entirely on one side of the external source , when the tides are directed radially outwards tending to tear apart the galaxy .",
    "our calculation of the tidal field caused by a galaxy @xmath27 of mass @xmath22 is illustrated in figure  [ tides_schem ] .",

    "the two small and two large arrows in figure  [ tides_schem ] indicate the gravitational field ( or acceleration ) at the opposite points caused by galaxy @xmath31 ( self - gravity ) and by galaxy  @xmath27 ( external source of gravitation ) , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the tidal field is given by the difference between the gravitational field caused by galaxy @xmath27 at the two opposite points , in the limit @xmath93 , but we do not make this approximation here . ]",
    "@xmath94    the gravitational field caused by galaxy @xmath31 ( two small arrows in figure  [ tides_schem ] ) is directed radially inwards and acts opposite to the tides , tending to keep the galactic mass inside radius @xmath95 intact . the difference between that self - gravitational field at the two opposite points is @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the mass of galaxy @xmath31 inside radius @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath98 , then the tides will exceed self - gravity at radii larger than @xmath95 , while self - gravity will exceed the tides at smaller radii .",
    "thus the layers of galactic mass located between radii @xmath95 and @xmath67 would become unbound , while the ones located inside radius @xmath95 would remain bound .",
    "hence , the galaxy would be partly disrupted . in our code , we simplify things by using an `` all - or - nothing '' approach .",
    "a galaxy is either totally disrupted , or not disrupted at all .",
    "we consider that a galaxy is disrupted if half of its mass or more becomes unbound .",
    "if we assume an isothermal sphere density profile ( as in appendix a ) , then the half - mass radius is given by @xmath99 .",
    "this is the value of @xmath95 we use in equations  ( [ f - tide ] ) and ( [ f - grav ] ) .",
    "the criterion of tidal destruction then becomes @xmath100 , with @xmath99 .",
    "we also consider tidal disruption by the background cluster halo , but only if @xmath101 ( that is , the galaxy does not overlap with the center of the halo ) .",
    "the magnitude of tidal field due to the cluster halo is @xmath102    where @xmath103 is given by equation  ( [ mhalo ] ) . if @xmath104 , with @xmath99 , galaxy @xmath31 is tidally destroyed by the gravitational field of the halo .",
    "when galaxy @xmath31 is considered to have been tidally destroyed by another galaxy @xmath27 , the fragments of the disrupted galaxy might accrete onto galaxy @xmath27 (  [ sec - tideaccr ] ) , or they might be dispersed into the icm when @xmath81 [ @xmath79 being the total energy of the galaxy pair given by eq .",

    "the disrupted fragments are always dispersed into the icm . in both cases ,",
    "the destroyed galaxy is removed from the list of existing particles .",
    "the code keeps track of the amount of mass added to the icm ( in the form of ic stars ) by tidal disruption .",
    "this quantity is initialized to zero at the beginning of the simulation , and every time a galaxy is tidally destroyed with its fragment dispersed , the mass of that galaxy is added up to the mass of ic stars .",
    "we consider a possibility of accretion of the fragments of a tidally disrupted galaxy onto the galaxy causing the tides .",
    "this happens for the case of tidal disruption due to galaxies only ( if the disruption is caused by the background cluster halo , the fragments are always dispersed as ic stars ) .",
    "this situation occurs when the conditions @xmath105 and @xmath77 are both satisfied ( see  [ sec - tideicl ] ) .",
    "the tidally disrupted galaxy accretes onto the more massive galaxy .",
    "the mass of the bigger galaxy increases from @xmath22 to @xmath106 .",
    "thus a tidal disruption followed by accretion is similar to a merger (  [ sec - merger ] ) , but these events are counted separately .      when a galaxy ventures at distances larger than the cluster halo truncation radius @xmath107 ( see  [ sec - halorho ] ) , we consider that this galaxy has escaped from the cluster , and we remove it from the list .",
    "if we kept that galaxy , it might eventually return to the cluster .",
    "but in reality the universe contains many clusters , and a galaxy that moves sufficiently far away from one cluster will eventually feel the gravitational influence of other clusters , something that our algorithm , which simulates an isolated cluster , does not take into account .",

    "a few clusters have too small @xmath218 , which are probably galaxy groups and low - mass clusters .",
    "our simulation results indicate that the tidal destruction of dwarf galaxies ( by other galaxies and by the cluster halo ) in clusters can sufficiently explain the observed fraction of intracluster light . supporting our conclusions ,",
    "observational studies do find a significant icl component arising from dwarf galaxies in clusters . from spectroscopic and photometric analysis , @xcite found that the metal poor globular cluster system associated with m87 ( the cd galaxy in virgo ) is not formed in situ , but is stripped from the dwarf galaxies in virgo .",
    "@xcite observed that most of the ic red - giant branch stars in virgo are moderately metal rich suggesting that they are tidally stripped from intermediate - luminosity galaxies , though stripping from dgs is not ruled out .",
    "@xcite observed trails of of ic stars and gas from the tidal disruption of a dg by a companion giant elliptical galaxy in virgo cluster .",
    "results from our simulation runs ( in  [ sec - results ] and  [ sec - dependence ] ) indicate that , for each cluster halo density profile , namely , @xmath43 , and nfw models , @xmath218 increases with the mass of the cluster halo .",
    "this is consistent with studies finding that more massive clusters have a larger fraction of icl than the less massive ones @xcite .",
    "the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology used in this work both reside in our somehow original approach of using one single particle to represent each galaxy , combined with a subgrid treatment of galaxy mergers , tidal disruption , and galaxy harassment .    on the positive side , this approach has enabled us to perform a very large number of simulations ( total ) , covering a fairly large parameter space , while obtaining statistically significant results .",
    "in particular , the dispersion of the results seen in tables  [ seriesa][seriesi ] justifies a posteriori the number of simulations we have performed .",
    "doing this many simulations without resorting to subgrid physics would have been computationally prohibitive .",
    "in addition , this approach greatly facilitates the analysis and interpretation of the results . in a simulation in which a galaxy would be represented by a large numbers of particles , a dwarf galaxy could be partly destroyed by tides , with some fragments being dispersed in the icm , other fragments accreting onto the larger galaxy , with enough of the galaxy surviving that it can still be counted as a galaxy .",
    "it would then become more difficult to quantify objectively the relative importance of mergers and tidal disruptions .",
    "in implementing the subgrid physics , we have attempted to make the most reasonable choices possible .",
    "one free parameter is the geometric factor entering in equation  ( [ internal ] ) , but for reasonable density profiles , the values of that factor do not appear to vary much .",
    "the assumption that a galaxy is considered `` tidally disrupted '' if 50% of its mass becomes unbound is also the most reasonable one we could make .",
    "our technique for generating the initial conditions is based on four key assumptions : ( 1 ) the galaxy distributions are isotropic , ( 2 ) the galaxy number density profile @xmath156 follows the density profile @xmath42 of the background cluster halo , ( 3 ) the mass is segregated in the cluster , with the most massive galaxies being located in the center , and ( 4 ) the cluster is in equilibrium .",
    "so even though our prescription for generating the initial conditions contains many tunable parameters , we believe that the underlying approach is sound .    on the negative side , two particular aspects of the methodology can be considered weak .",
    "first , the treatment of galaxy harassment is highly speculative .",
    "we have assumed that some amount of orbital kinetic energy @xmath82 is dissipated into internal energy during an encounter between two galaxies , that this amount is related to the initial internal energies of the galaxies , and that the energy dissipated is distributed equally between the two galaxies .",
    "the dissipation of energy and its consequences during a real galactic encounter are certainly much more complex , so the subgrid model could potentially be refined . but this would require an intensive study of high - speed encounters , with detailed numerical simulations , and such study remains to be done .",
    "another important limitation of our approach is that it deals with isolated clusters in equilibrium . in the real universe , clusters constantly experience mergers and accretion .",
    "we justify our approach by the fact that most clusters will experience , at some epoch , a _",
    "major merger _ , during which most of the final mass of the cluster is assembled . from that point , if we can neglect the addition of mass by minor mergers and accretion , the cluster can be treated as isolated .",
    "of course , such scenario can not describe all clusters . in a forthcoming paper @xcite",
    ", we will present a study of cluster formation and evolution inside a cosmological volume containing many clusters .",
    "this will be achieved by implementing the subgrid approach described in this paper into a cosmological n - body algorithm .",
    "we have designed a simple model for the evolution of galaxies in an isolated cluster , in order to compare the destruction of dwarf galaxies by mergers vs. tidal disruptions , and to predict the contribution of dwarf galaxies to the origin of intracluster stars .",
    "our algorithm combines a direct n - body computation of gravitational interactions , along with a subgrid treatment of the other physical processes ( merger , tidal disruption , accretion etc . ) of the galaxies . using this algorithm ,",
    "we have performed a total of numerical simulations of galaxy clusters , examining the fate of dwarf galaxies .",
    "our results and conclusions are as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the destruction of dwarf galaxies by mergers dominates over destruction by tides , in most of our simulation runs with all the models ( @xmath43-virgo , @xmath43-perseus , nfw ) of cluster halo density .",
    "the two destruction mechanisms become comparable , and tides outnumber mergers , for the nfw and the @xmath43- models when their scale / core radius approach and exceed @xmath326 200 - 300 kpc .",
    "\\(2 ) the destruction of dwarf galaxies by the tidal field of other galaxies and by the cluster halo imparts a significant amount of galactic mass into the icm .",
    "this is sufficient to account for the observed fraction of intracluster light in galaxy clusters . in our simulations , the ics mass fraction , @xmath218 ,",
    "has a range @xmath327 ( with the majority of values being in between @xmath328 ) , for the different parameter sets of the @xmath43 and nfw models of cluster halo density we considered .",
    "we see a clear trend of increase of @xmath218 with the mass of the cluster halo .",
    "all these are well consistent with observations and other numerical studies .",
    "\\(3 ) in the nfw model simulated clusters , there are a large number of tidal disruptions of galaxies caused by the gravitational potential of the cluster halo , and this component dominates the mass fraction .",
    "we note that it has been our assumption that the cluster halo is stationary , and does not evolve in response to the forces exerted on it by the galaxies (  [ sec - ppalgo ] ) .",
    "such an assumption is probably a poor one with the nfw model clusters .",
    "we point out that this could imply a possible solution to the cusp crisis of cluster dark matter halos .",
    "the central cuspy region of the cluster dark matter halo could have inelastic encounters with the member galaxies , which could inject energy into the halo and erase the cusp .",
    "\\(4 ) in our simulations , the presence of a cd galaxy increases occurrences of accretion , decreases tidal disruptions by the cluster halo , and reduces the ics mass fraction .",
    "this is opposite to the trend seen from observations that @xmath218 is higher in the presence of a cd .",
    "this work benefited from stimulating discussions with l. edwards and c. robert .",
    "we thank john kormendy for useful correspondence .",
    "all calculations were performed at the laboratoire dastrophysique numrique , universit laval .",
    "we thank the canada research chair program and nserc for support .",
    "since we represent galaxies as individual particles , we can not directly compute their internal energy .",
    "we therefore need an estimate that can then be used in equation  ( [ internal ] ) .",
    "we write the potential energy of a galaxy of mass @xmath209 and radius @xmath329 as @xmath330    where @xmath74 is the _ geometric factor _ , which depends on the shape and density distribution of the galaxy . for a uniform - density sphere , @xmath331 . in our simplified model , we treat galaxies as spheres , but we should certainly not assume a uniform density . instead , any galaxy will be centrally concentrated .",
    "the value of @xmath74 will depend on the assumed density profile , but we do not expect that dependence to be very strong if we stick with reasonable profiles .",
    "so we consider the simplest case of an isothermal sphere with a cutoff radius @xmath329 . the density and mass inside @xmath65",
    "are given by @xmath332          hence , @xmath75 for an isothermal sphere .",
    "interestingly , this is not much different from the value of 3/5 for a uniform sphere .",
    "this supports our claim that the sensitivity of @xmath74 on the density profile is weak . for the kinetic energy",
    ", we assume that the galaxies are virialized .",
    "hence , @xmath338 , and therefore the internal energy is given by @xmath339"
