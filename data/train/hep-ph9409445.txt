    "this energy barrier between topologically distinct vacua can be overcome due to thermal fluctuations of the fields , and fermion number violating vacuum to vacuum transitions involving changes of baryon and lepton number can occur .",
    "the rate for such baryon number violating processes is largely determined by a boltzmann factor , containing the height of the barrier at a given temperature and thus the energy of the sphaleron .",
    "baryon number violation in the standard model due to such transitions over the barrier may be relevant for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
