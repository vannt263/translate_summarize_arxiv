    "charm photoproduction measurements have been performed at the hera _ ep _ collider in the zeus detector from data taken during 1995 - 2000 .",
    "electrons or positrons with energy @xmath7 collided with protons of energy @xmath8 ( 1995 - 1997 ) or @xmath9 ( 1998 - 2000 ) .",
    "the zeus detector description can be found elsewhere @xcite .    the decay chain @xmath10 ( @xmath11 integrated luminosity ) was studied @xcite as a continuation of a previous analysis of charm photoproduction @xcite .",
    "the study of @xmath12 photoproduction provides another test of next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) calculations .",
    "orbitally excited p - wave @xmath13 mesons can decay to a @xmath14 by pion emission .",
    "two of these states ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) have been found to decay into narrow states @xcite with properties predicted by heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite and a third broad state has been seen by the cleo collaboration @xcite . a radial excitation of the @xmath17 with a mass of about 2.6 @xmath18 decaying into @xmath5 has been reported by delphi @xcite but not seen by opal and cleo @xcite .",
    "inelastic @xmath19 photoproduction proceeds via direct ( resolved ) processes , where the virtual photon ( parton from the photon ) interacts with a parton from the incoming proton . in the dominant process ,",
    "boson gluon fusion ( bgf ) , the latter parton is a gluon .",
    "photon diffraction to @xmath19 also contributes .",
    "the inelasticity variable , @xmath20 , can be used to distinguish these processes .",
    "here @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the four - momenta of the incoming proton , @xmath19 and exchanged photon , respectively . from previous zeus data @xcite",
    "the diffractive process dominates at @xmath24 , the direct photon process dominates at @xmath25z@xmath26 .",
    "the resolved photon contribution is expected to dominate at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "color singlet and color octet models have been used to calculate the above non - diffractive production processes in pqcd . for the former ,",
    "the charm - anticharm pair ( @xmath28 ) from the hard process is identified with the physical @xmath19 state . in this model in leading order ( lo ) only the bgf diagram contributes to the direct channel . in the color octet model the @xmath28 pair from the hard process emits one or more soft gluons to evolve into the physical @xmath19 state .",
    "the free parameters of the model can be extracted from @xmath19 cross - section measurements and used in other inelastic @xmath19 production experiments .",
    "@xmath12 production was studied for : @xmath29,@xmath30,@xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the photon virtuality , @xmath34 is the virtual photon proton center of mass energy , @xmath35 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath12 and @xmath36 is the pseudorapidity of the @xmath12 .",
    "the effective mass of two opposite charge track combinations , assumed to be kaons , was calculated and plotted in fig .",
    "a clear enhancement at the @xmath37 mass is seen .",
    "the effective mass of the combinations in this enhancement region and another track assumed to be a pion was then obtained .",
    "the peak in the @xmath12 mass region contained @xmath38 mesons ( fig .",
    "1b ) , corresponding to a cross section of @xmath39 .    *",
    "( a )  ( b ) *    distributions in @xmath35 and @xmath36 were compared with those for @xmath17 production @xcite and with a fixed order nlo calculation @xcite in which charm was produced by the bgf process .",
    "the signal is above the prediction ( fig .",
    "2 ) , particularly for @xmath40 along the proton beam direction , as was the case for @xmath17 production .    *",
    "( a )  ( b ) *    the ratio of the cross section for @xmath12 to @xmath17 production at hera has been compared to that from @xmath3 experiments , where the latter result is taken from a recent compilation @xcite of fragmentation fractions to charm mesons ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the results from the two types of interactions are : + @xmath42/@xmath43 and @xmath44/@xmath45 . + the strangeness suppression factor , @xmath46 , ( the ratio of the probability to produce a strange quark to that to produce a non - strange quark ) , has also been compared to that from @xmath3 experiments . from hera the value of the above cross section ratio and the pythia monte carlo was used and for @xmath3 the quantity @xmath47/@xmath48}$ ] served as an estimator for @xmath46 .",
    "the values of @xmath46 for hera and @xmath3 , respectively , were @xmath49 and @xmath50 , implying consistency with universal charm fragmentation .",
    "as a basis for the study of higher excitatations of charm mesons , an enlarged sample of data ( integrated luminosity of @xmath51 ) , containing a clean signal of @xmath17 mesons from both photoproduction and deep inelastic scattering , was used @xcite .",
    "events in the mass range @xmath52 , @xmath53 were chosen ( @xmath54 is the low momentum pion in the @xmath14 decay ) .",
    "the background ( estimated from events in which the k and @xmath55 in the @xmath56 mass range have the same charge ) has been subtracted , yielding @xmath57 @xmath17 .    for orbital excitations an extra track , @xmath58 , was added to the @xmath17 candidate and the effective mass combination , @xmath59 , was evaluated .",
    "an enhancement in the mass distribution with total charge zero is seen in fig .",
    "this spectrum was fitted to @xmath60 and @xmath61 breit - wigner shapes with masses and widths fixed @xcite , and convoluted with a gaussian function with a width as in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the background was described by @xmath62 , where @xmath63 , with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 constant .",
    "helicity angle distributions for @xmath60 and @xmath61 proportional to @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively , were folded in for the fit .    *  ( a ) *    *  ( b )  ( c ) *    here , @xmath69 is the angle between @xmath58 and @xmath54 in the @xmath17 rest frame . a closer look , ( fig .",
    "3b ) , indicates an excess of events near @xmath70 .",
    "an extra gaussian was included to better fit the data .",
    "the fit ( fig .",
    "3c ) yielded @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 entries for the number of @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the additional gaussian combinations .",
    "the mass of the extra gaussian was @xmath74 with a width consistent with the detector resolution .",
    "the ratios of the rates of the @xmath75 decay channel of @xmath60 and @xmath61 to @xmath17 are and , respectively . extrapolating to the full kinematic region and using @xcite along with known branching ratios @xcite as well as isospin conservation , the result",
    "is given in table 1 .",
    "this result is consistent with those from @xmath3 experiments .    in order to search for a radially excited @xmath14 meson , @xmath76 , the combination @xmath77 , where @xmath58 and @xmath78 are oppositely charged pions with @xmath79 , was fitted along with a background distribution of @xmath80 , where @xmath81 .",
    "no peak was seen in the expected mass range , ( @xmath82 ) ( fig .",
    "an upper limit was obtained by    fitting the background outside this range , interpolating within the range and subtracting this from the data in the mass range .",
    "the @xmath83 confidence level upper limit for the @xmath84 decay relative to @xmath17 was found to be @xmath85 . extrapolating to the full kinematic range and using @xcite , @xmath86 at @xmath83 confidence level was obtained .",
    "the equivalent opal limit is @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath88 decay channel of @xmath19 for @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , using the 1996 - 1997 data , has been studied @xcite .",
    "distributions in @xmath92 , rapidity and transverse momentum squared of the @xmath19 and a comparison with theoretical expectations are shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath92 dependence of the data is not described in magnitude by the lo color singlet and octet model with octet matrix elements calculated from the cdf data @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the nlo color singlet model @xcite roughly fits the spectrum for @xmath93 . for @xmath94 the lo model with octet matrix elements from cleo data",
    "agrees with the data for high @xmath92 only @xcite .",
    "currently there is no calculation in nlo for the rapidity distribution .",
