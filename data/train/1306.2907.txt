    "spectral estimation constitutes a classical problem that has found applications in a large variety of fields ( including astronomy , radar , communications , economics , medical imaging , spectroscopy ,  , to name but a few ) .",
    "one important category of spectral estimation problems arises for signals that can be well represented by the parametric model @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an additive noise term . given a vector of (",
    "typically equally spaced ) samples , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the sampling period , the goal is to estimate the complex frequency nodes @xmath4 i.e. , the damping and frequency parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that once the parameters @xmath7 have been computed , determining @xmath8 reduces to a simple linear regression problem .",
    "thus , the focus lies on the estimation of the nodes @xmath9 .",
    "the signal model includes the case of exponentially damped signals defined by @xmath10 .",
    "this case has recently received significant interest , notably in applications involving nuclear quadrupole resonance signals for which the @xmath5 ( together with @xmath6 ) are used as a signature of the chemical composition of an analysed substance ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the literature on methods for estimating @xmath9 in this setting is rich , cf .",
    "@xcite for an overview . here",
    ", we focus on so - called _ high - resolution _ methods , i.e. , methods whose frequency resolution is not tied to a pre - defined grid ( and can attain numerical precision in the noise free case ) .",
    "+ one important class of techniques is based on the principle of nonlinear least squares ( nls ) @xcite and aims at solving the nonlinear regression problem associated with , i.e. , at minimizing @xmath11 with respect to the parameter vectors @xmath12 and @xmath9 . although nls enjoy desirable theoretical properties ( e.g. , those of maximum likelihood estimators when @xmath1 is a gaussian white noise ; robustness to coloured noise ) , their practical use remains limited due to the extreme difficulty of globally minimizing @xmath13 due to its pronounced multimodal shape with one very sharp global minimum ( cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ a second prominent and popular class is given by subspace methods ( such as music @xcite , esprit @xcite and min - norm @xcite ) .",
    "these methods are based on estimates of the covariance of @xmath14 and rely on the assumption that the noise @xmath15 is white . in the present contribution",
    ", we develop a novel high - resolution methodology for the estimation of @xmath9 in .",
    "similar to nls , we aim at approximating @xmath14 as good as possible by a linear combination of complex exponentials .",
    "however , the proposed methodology fundamentally departs from any of the above methods in the following ways :    first , it is based on _",
    "kronecker s theorem _ for complex symmetric matrices , which essentially states that if a function @xmath16 is uniformly sampled , then the _ hankel matrix _ that is generated by the vector of samples @xmath14 has rank @xmath17 if and only if @xmath16 coincides at the sample points with a function that is a linear combination of @xmath17 exponential functions .",
    "this fact has been used for the sparse approximation of functions by sums of exponentials in the con - eigenvalue approach @xcite and the alternating projections method @xcite . here , it is used to formulate an nls type minimization problem in which the model ( and its parameters @xmath12 and @xmath9 ) does not enter explicitly . instead , the model is imposed _",
    "implicitly _ by constraining the rank of the hankel matrix generated by the vector @xmath18 approximating @xmath14 to equal @xmath17 . consequently , residual minimization is not performed over the parameter space @xmath19 directly , but over the space of vectors @xmath18 which generate hankel matrices of rank @xmath17 .",
    "the frequency nodes @xmath9 are then obtained by considering the con - eigenvectors of the solution hankel matrix .",
    "second , we reformulate the minimization problem such that it can be effectively solved by the _ alternating direction method of multipliers _",
    "( admm ) @xcite .",
    "admm is an iterative technique that is recently gaining popularity due to its robustness , versatility and applicability to large - scale problems .",
    "moreover , this technique enjoys performance comparable to problem - specific state - of - the - art methods . while the optimization problem considered here is nonconvex , it is shown numerically that the solutions obtained with the admm procedure generically provide excellent approximations and parameter estimates for the model .",
    "the resulting hankel matrix admm frequency estimation procedure is practically extremely appealing due to its simplicity and ease of implementation .",
    "it enjoys excellent performance , outperforming subspace methods while at the same time alleviating the practical limitations of classical nls . unlike subspace methods",
    ", it does not rely on a specific noise model .",
    "another interesting property is that it applies to situations with _ missing _ ( or censored ) data .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : admm ] , we define an optimization problem based on kronecker s theorem for the approximation by sums of complex exponentials and formulate the admm - based procedure for obtaining its solution . section [ sec : freqest ] summarizes the procedure for obtaining frequency node estimates from the solution hankel matrix . in section [ sec : results ] , we analyze the performance of the method by means of numerical simulations . section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes this contribution and points to future work .",
    "in this section , we approximate the vector @xmath14 as good as possible by a vector @xmath18 that is a linear combination of complex exponential functions . using kronecker s theorem",
    ", we express the solution to this approximation problem in terms of the vector @xmath18 whose hankel matrix has rank @xmath17 and minimizes the residual .",
    "the resulting optimization problem will then be reformulated and solved by admm .      for completeness , we recall that a hankel matrix @xmath20 has constant values on the anti - diagonals , i.e. , @xmath21 it can thus be generated elementwise from a vector @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 we denote this by @xmath24 .    _ kronecker s theorem _",
    "@xcite states that if the hankel matrix @xmath24 generated by the vector @xmath18 is of rank @xmath17 then , with the exception of degenerate cases , there exists @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that @xmath27 the converse holds as well .",
    "it follows that the best approximation ( in the @xmath28 sense ) of @xmath14 by a linear combination of @xmath17 complex exponentials is given by the vector @xmath18 which satisfies @xmath29 and minimizes the @xmath28 norm of the residual @xmath30 . in other words , @xmath18 can be obtained as the solution of the optimisation problem @xmath31    the parameter @xmath17 can be selected by considering the singular values of the hankel matrix @xmath32 generated by the samples @xmath14 , cf .",
    ", @xcite . at this stage ,",
    "we assume @xmath17 to be given .",
    "let @xmath33 be the indicator function for square matrices @xmath34 given by @xmath35 then , problem can be reformulated as follows @xmath36 the optimization problem has a cost function that consists of two terms , each depending only on one of the variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 , along with a linear constraint .",
    "the problem formulation is therefore well suited to be addressed using admm .",
    "admm is an iterative technique in which a solution to a large global problem is found by coordinating solutions to smaller subproblems .",
    "it can be seen as an attempt to merge the benefits of dual decomposition and augmented lagrangian methods for constrained optimization .",
    "for an overview of the admm method see @xcite . for a convex cost function admm",
    "is guaranteed to converge to the unique solution . for non - convex problems",

    "let @xmath61 denote the set of indices @xmath62 of the missing data samples and set @xmath63 .",
    "the use of weights @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 yields an admm procedure for data with missing samples .      in order to highlight the simplicity of the proposed algorithm , the admm procedure was described above to terminate after a preset number @xmath66 of iterations . commonly used stopping criteria are based on the magnitude of the primal and dual residuals and are straight - forward to incorporate in the admm procedure ( cf .",
    ", @xcite for details ) .",
    "the admm procedure would converge to the global solution of the problem if the problem was convex .",

    "once the solution hankel matrix @xmath24 to has been found , the parameter vector @xmath9 can be obtained by considering the so - called con - eigenvectors of @xmath37 .",
    "hankel matrices belong to the class of complex symmetric matrices satisfying @xmath71 , which generically can be decomposed as @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the decreasingly ordered con - eigenvalues of @xmath37 and where the _ con - eigenvectors _",

    "let @xmath80 .",
    "it is then possible to write @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the @xmath83 vandermonde matrix generated by @xmath84 ( i.e. , @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 is some ( invertible ) @xmath87 matrix .",
