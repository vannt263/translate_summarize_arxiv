    "several mechanisms may contribute into @xmath5 decay rate including @xmath6 type transitions , where @xmath7 is a vector meson , with a subsequent @xmath8 radiative decay , and electric dipole radiative transition @xmath9 with a scalar @xmath10 meson decaying into @xmath11 .",
    "theoretical predictions of the @xmath0 branching ratio , based on assumption of pure @xmath6 decay mechanism ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , are quite low , of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "situation with theoretical description of the @xmath9 decay is much more complicated , because the results strongly depend on the quark structure of the @xmath10 meson . at present , its quark structure is not well established and several models exist including modifications of @xmath13 scheme @xcite , 4-quark model @xcite , and @xmath14 molecular model @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimations of @xmath9 branching ratios vary from about @xmath15 in two - quark and @xmath14 molecular models up to @xmath16 in the 4-quark model ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) , making the @xmath9 decay a unique probe of the structure of @xmath10 meson .    the first search for the @xmath17 decay",
    "was conducted in the nd experiment @xcite at vepp-2 m @xmath18 collider in 1987 , where an upper limit of @xmath19 was established . in 1995",
    "the new snd detector having better hermeticity , granularity , energy and spatial resolution started operation at vepp-2 m .",
    "first indications of @xmath17 decay were seen by snd in 1997 @xcite .",
    "the result was based on analysis of half of the @xmath3-meson data recorded in 19961997 . in this work analysis of full data sample",
    "was carried out .",
    "the @xmath17 decay was observed for the first time and its branching ratio was measured .",
    "experiment @xcite , @xcite was carried out in 1996 at vepp-2 m @xmath18 collider with snd detector .",
    "the snd detector @xcite is a universal nonmagnetic detector .",
    "its main part is a 3-layer electromagnetic calorimeter consisted of 1630 nai(tl ) crystals with a total thickness of 35 cm or 14 radiation lengths .",
    "the energy resolution for photons can be described as @xmath20{e(gev)}$ ] @xcite , the angular resolution of the calorimeter is close to 1.5 degrees , and the solid angle coverage is @xmath21 of @xmath22 steradian .",
    "the data , used for the study of @xmath23 decay was recorded in 1996 - 1997 in the energy range from 980 to 1040 mev with the most of the data collected in the close vicinity of the @xmath3-peak .",
    "six successive scans of the energy range were performed with a total integrated luminosity of @xmath24 and total number of @xmath3-mesons produced of @xmath25 .",
    "the main background sources for the process under study    @xmath26    are the following @xmath3-meson decays : @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 and nonresonant process @xmath30    the expected number of events of the process ( 1 ) at a branching ratio of @xmath23 equal to @xmath16 is about 300 , while the number of background events ( 2 ) is @xmath31 .",
    "although the process ( 2 ) does not produce @xmath32 events directly , it can fake the topology of the process ( 1 ) due to either merging of close photons or loss of soft photons through openings in the calorimeter .",
    "the process ( 3 ) produces @xmath33 @xmath34 events with @xmath35 decays .",
    "the @xmath36-s in @xmath3-meson decays are slow and have a decay length of 3 m , while the nuclear interaction length in nai(tl ) is about 30 cm .",
    "characteristic feature of spurious @xmath32 events produced by @xmath34 decays due to either nuclear interaction of @xmath36-s or their decays in flight is an energy - momentum imbalance and poor quality of at least one photon in the event .",
    "primary event selection was based on simple criteria : the number of reconstructed photons is equal to five , there are no tracks in the central drift chambers , the total energy deposition ranges from 0.8 to 1.1 center of mass energy @xmath37 , and the total transverse momentum is less than @xmath38 .",
    "such criteria greatly reduce background from the processes ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , not affecting the decays ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) .",
    "also rejected were the events containing close photon pairs with spatial angle between photons less than 27 degrees , where energies could be poorly reconstructed .",
    "next step in the event selection was based on quality of photons and kinematic fit .",
    "@xcite was constructed describing the likelihood of a hypothesis , that given transverse energy deposition profile of a cluster of hit crystals in the calorimeter can be attributed to a single photon .",
    "the requirements were imposed that @xmath40 , for all photons .",
    "then kinematic fit was performed under the assumption , that selected events are @xmath41 ones and corresponding parameter @xmath42 , describing the likelihood of this assumption was calculated . events with @xmath43 were also rejected .",
    "study of simulated @xmath32 events of the processes ( 1 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) showed , that the @xmath42 and @xmath39 cuts reject less than @xmath44 of true @xmath32 events , suppressing the process ( 2 ) by a factor of 3 and making the expected background due to the process ( 3 ) very small , of the order of 10 events .",
    "although , in contrast with the other processes , the monte carlo simulation of the process ( 3 ) is much less accurate due to nuclear interaction of @xmath36 , so the data analysis may not completely rely on this estimation .",
    "characteristic feature of the process ( 1 ) is that each event must contain two photon pairs with invariant masses of @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons .",
    "simulation shows that if the photons in an event are enumerated in descending order in energy , the photons from @xmath47 decay have the numbers of either 1 and 2 or 1 and 3 . corresponding experimental and simulated distributions in @xmath48 and @xmath49 with an additional requirement , that rest of photons contains a pair with @xmath50 and more stringent photon quality requirement @xmath51 .",
    "are shown in fig.[inclusive ] .",
    "background estimations are based on pdg table value for @xmath52 decay branching ratio @xcite , our measurements of @xmath53 cross section @xcite and @xmath54 decay branching ratio @xcite .",
    "distribution of experimental events in @xmath55 shows an enhancement centered at @xmath45-meson mass , while the sum of background processes is nearly flat in this region .",
    "the sum of all simulated background processes , where each one was normalized to the number of events expected at a given integrated luminosity and total number @xmath3-meson decays , describes the spectrum outside the enhancement quite well .",
    "if this excess of events is due to the decay ( 1 ) , it corresponds to a @xmath17 branching ratio of the order of @xmath56 , but it is difficult to extract accurate result from these inclusive spectra , because of poor signal to background ratio and unknown decay dynamics .    detailed study of the process ( 1 ) requires substantial suppression of background . it could be done using kinematic fit with intermediate @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons taken into account . for each event @xmath57 and @xmath58 hypotheses were tried and corresponding @xmath59 , and @xmath60 parameters calculated .",
    "to suppress the processes ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) the following requirements were imposed : @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and for additional suppression the process ( 2 ) : @xmath63 . with these requirements the contribution from the processes ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) , which are relatively rare themselves , becomes negligible .",
    "the resulting spectra of the @xmath64 , energy of the most energetic photon , are shown in fig.[er1n ] . since the recoil photon in the process ( 2 )",
    "has a narrow spectrum peaked at 360 mev , @xmath64 must be more than 0.7 in this process .",
    "the spectrum in fig.[er1n]b , where true 5@xmath65 events are suppressed by an order of magnitude , is well reproduced by simulation of the process ( 2 ) alone , while the spectrum in fig.[er1n]a shows excess of experimental events with @xmath63 over the simulation of ( 2 ) .",
    "the background ( 2 ) still dominates at @xmath66 , so events with @xmath66 were rejected . from fig.[er1n]a one can see , that this roughly halves the detection efficiency for the process ( 1 ) .",
    "this also enhances dependence of the detection efficiency on the invariant mass of @xmath11 system , which varies from @xmath67 at @xmath68 up to @xmath69 at @xmath70 .",
    "the distributions of the events over photon quality parameter @xmath39 are shown in fig.[xinm ] .",
    "selection criteria here were the same as described above , except loosened requirement on photon quality : @xmath71 .",
    "it can be seen , that simulation well describes the background from the process ( 2 ) , while the excess of events in fig.[xinm]a at low @xmath39 is compatible with existence of the decay ( 1 ) with br of the order of @xmath16 .",
    "also was checked the distribution in @xmath72 .",
    "while the distributions of experimental events with @xmath73 is in a good agreement with simulation of the process ( 2 ) , the distribution of the events with @xmath63 agrees with the simulation of the process ( 1 ) with a small contribution of the process ( 2 ) . the total number of selected events satisfying the selection criteria is 25 , from which 5 were estimated to be a background from the process ( 2 ) .",
    "the corresponding branching ratio was calculated using the @xmath11 invariant mass distribution of the selected events and detection efficiencies , obtained from simulation .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath74 , where error is a statistical one . for such stringent selection criteria",
    "the systematic error in detection efficiency could be as high as 15% , but at present level of experimental statistics the statistical error dominates .    in order to study the @xmath11 mass spectrum",
    "the @xmath75 cut was dropped .",
    "this increased the background from the @xmath52 decay , but made detection efficiency twice higher and less dependent on @xmath11 mass .",
    "the @xmath76 background was subtracted using events with @xmath77 outside @xmath45 peak .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[epmass ] .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum was fitted using formulae from ref.@xcite and assuming that the decay is a pure @xmath9 transition .",
    "the result is also shown in fig.[epmass ] .",
    "it is seen , that although the errors are very large , the observed mass spectrum is consistent with @xmath78 decay mechanism .",
    "constraint fit with @xmath79 @xcite gives the following values of @xmath10 meson parameters : + @xmath80 , + @xmath81 .",
    "in this work evidence of the new decay @xmath17 with a branching ratio of @xmath4 is presented .",
    "the observed enhancement in the @xmath11 invariant mass spectrum at large @xmath82 is consistent with domination of @xmath78 decay mechanism , while relatively high decay rate agrees with the theoretical predictions based on 4-quark model of @xmath10-meson @xcite , @xcite .",
