    "it is easy to see that the orbit can not be periodic , since any perpendicular periodic orbit must be twice perpendicular and the collision at time @xmath46 is not perpendicular .",

    "@xmath47 consider the central symmetry of the palindromic beam around its center @xmath48 .",
    "this takes the beam to a priori another beam with the same code .",

    "furthermore @xmath115 can not hit @xmath105 a second time at the same end point , in fact assuming this holds halves the period of @xmath115 , a contradiction of the definition of minimal period .",
    "thus both sides of @xmath114 must consist of periodic perpendicular orbits ( see figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "if @xmath115 is simple then both sides of @xmath115 consist of periodic perpendicular orbits and @xmath115 can not be part of the boundary of @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath115 is not simple then the `` other '' side of @xmath115 is also a periodic loop , for which , by the same reasoning , bounds perpendicular period orbits .",
    "since @xmath102 is a finite union of annuli , there can only be a finite number of perpendicular periodic loops .",
    "thus , by exhaustion , all of @xmath109 consists of perpendicular periodic loops , and can not form part of the boundary of @xmath102 .",
    "this contradiction completes the proof .",
    "next we prove the analog of proposition [ lemma5 ] for perpendicular directions .",
    "[ lemma12 ] fix an irrational right triangle @xmath98 whose smaller angle @xmath97 . consider the angular coding with respect to the perpendicular direction , then    1 .",
    "there is exactly one code for which @xmath54 and @xmath82 and 2 .   for all codes",
    "for which @xmath83 the code is a palindrome and @xmath15 is even .",
    "we consider the same notation as in the proof of proposition  [ lemma5 ] , the difference being that generalized diagonals exist .",
    "suppose for the moment that no generalized diagonal passes through both @xmath117 and @xmath86 .",
    "note that by symmetry a perpendicular orbit can reach only a single @xmath118 .",
    "let @xmath119 be the cardinality of the points in @xmath85 whose orbits arrive at a vertex in @xmath86 before returning to level @xmath32 or @xmath58 .",
    "they partition the @xmath85 into @xmath120 intervals and corresponding beams @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath121 be the cardinality of the set of orbits which start in @xmath85 and arrive @xmath117 .",
    "consider the beam @xmath88 containing such an orbit , arguing as in the simple case that each center is in a different beam yields @xmath122 .",
    "if no orbit from @xmath85 reaches @xmath93 before returning level @xmath32 or @xmath58 , then the orbit of @xmath93 never reaches rhombus @xmath32 or @xmath58 .",
    "thus by lemma [ lemma3 ] it s orbit is periodic or its orbit closure is a minimal iet . in either case since the map is a local isometry we can associate @xmath93 with a vertex @xmath123 such that no orbit from @xmath85 reaches this vertex .",
    "furthermore one generalized diagonal can not be the complete boundary to two minimal or periodic components of an iet .",
    "thus for a set of cardinality @xmath105 of such @xmath93 we must have at least @xmath105 distinct such vertices @xmath124 .",
    "this implies @xmath125 , or @xmath126 .",
    "we have shown that @xmath127 , i.e.  the number of beams which do not contain a center is at most 2 .",
    "these two beams are the only candidates for beams connecting level @xmath32 to @xmath58 and @xmath58 to @xmath32 .",
    "now we deal with the case when there is an orbit passing through both @xmath117 and @xmath86 .",
    "note that any orbit which starts perpendicularly and arrives at @xmath128 before @xmath86 , returns , by the central symmetry to a perpendicular collision and is thus simple .",
    "thus we have reduced to the case when an orbit visits @xmath86 before @xmath117 . by the central symmetry",
    "it is a generalized diagonal .",
    "the counting argument above works with the following differences .",
    "first of all we consider this generalized diagonal as a degenerate beam @xmath88 . for this degenerate beam",
    "we interpret @xmath44 and @xmath121 as follows . since @xmath88 visits a single @xmath118 it contributes one to @xmath121 and since @xmath120 is the number of beams it contributes one to @xmath44 . with these modifications",
    "the inequality @xmath127 remains true and as above we conclude that all but at most two of the beams contain a center . by the central symmetry around the center the code of each such beam",
    "must satisfy @xmath129 .",
    "next we need to show that exactly two exceptional beams exist . if no exceptional beam exists then lemma  [ babypascal ] yields an immediate contradiction . if one exceptional beam exists , if @xmath130 then again lemma  [ babypascal ] yields an immediate contradiction . in the other cases ( @xmath131 or @xmath132 )",
    "the points of the exceptional beam can not be recurrent , which is a contradiction of the fact that almost every point is recurrent .",
    "thus exactly two exceptional beams exist .",
    "all the other beams contain a center and thus are palindromes with @xmath15 even .",
    "finally we need to show that in fact one of the two beams satisfies @xmath133 and the other satisfies @xmath134 .",
    "if we think of the beams as marked ( 1st and 2nd ) then there are 16 possible cases depending on of @xmath135 or @xmath58 for @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "two of these cases are good , we must eliminate all the 14 other cases .",
    "since almost every point is recurrent we can not have a beam starting with @xmath32 and ending with @xmath58 without the other beam connecting level @xmath58 to level @xmath32 , this eliminates 6 cases .    to be able to apply lemma  [ babypascal ] repeat the construction for points which are perpendicular to the leg of the triangle but",
    "whose code is strictly negative before returning to level @xmath32 or @xmath138 to produce two addition exceptional beams with codes @xmath139 , which are centrally symmetric to the two original ones in the sense that @xmath140 for @xmath136 .",
    "a direct application of lemma  [ babypascal ] eliminates the the remaining 8 bad cases when there is no beam starting in @xmath32 ending in @xmath58 .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] the theorem follows immediately for by combining lemma  [ lemma2 ] and propostion  [ lemma12 ] .",
    "theorem [ thm2 ] we start with the simple case .",
    "first consider orbits whose code starts with @xmath33 .",
    "any such nonsingular nonrecurrent orbit must be contained in the intersection @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the unique interval which satisfy alternative ( 1 ) for fixed @xmath143 of proposition  [ lemma5 ] .",
    "consider the initial segment of these beams , these intervals are clearly nested , thus there is at most one interval or a single point in the intersection of their closures .",
    "since the set of nonrecurrent orbits has measure zero it consists of at most a single point .",
    "the orbits of this point is either a positive escape orbits or singular .",
    "similarly we find a single positive escape orbit starting on any level @xmath58 .",
    "this escape orbit must , by uniqueness , coincide with the one starting on level @xmath32 .",
    "a symmetric argument holds for the backwards escape orbit , by starting with points whose code commences with @xmath144 .",
    "we turn to the perpendicular case .",
    "the fist difference to the simple case is that we replace proposition  [ lemma5 ] by proposition [ lemma12 ] .",
    "we immediately obtain that there is at most one positive escape orbit starting on level @xmath32 . to show that this is the unique positive escape orbit on the whole surface we argue like in the proof of propostion  [ lemma12 ] .",
    "fix @xmath145 .",
    "the first part proof goes through for levels @xmath23 and @xmath58 , i.e.  we know that there are at most two exceptional beams .",
    "we need to conclude that they exist and that they connect levels @xmath23 and @xmath58 to each other without applying lemma  [ babypascal ] .",
    "this follows immediately from the fact that there is a beam connecting level @xmath32 to @xmath58 and a beam connecting level @xmath58 to level @xmath32 .    by symmetry",
    ", the positive and negative escape orbits must be the forward and backwards part of the same orbit .",
    "theorem [ pascal ] the proof is similar to the proof of lemma  [ babypascal ] .",
    "the set of perpendicular periodic orbits form a countable union of annuli @xmath100 .",
    "if @xmath101 then @xmath102 must have a boundary which must consist of generalized diagonals and escape orbits .",
    "besides the escape orbit , there is an additional difficulty that the relevant part of the graph of generalized diagonals on @xmath23 need not be finite .",
    "the argument that a _ finite _ connected component @xmath109 satisfying @xmath146 can not form part of the boundary of @xmath102 is the same as in the proof of lemma  [ babypascal ] .",
    "this completes the proof in the rational case .",
    "next suppose that the escape orbit exists , i.e.  is nonsingular .",
    "denote this orbit by @xmath147 . by construction ,",
    "the orbit @xmath147 starts on level @xmath32 at a point @xmath148 which is an interior point of @xmath105 .",
    "thus we can find a sequence of perpendicular periodic orbits which approaches @xmath147 from the left and a sequence which approaches @xmath147 from the right , and @xmath147 can not form part of the boundary of @xmath102 .    the remaining case is @xmath109 infinite .",
    "there are two subcases , either every edge in the graph has periodic perpendicular orbits on both sides or not . in the first case we argue as in the proof of lemma  [ babypascal ] , using induction instead of exhaustion to complete the proof . in the second case the ( unique )",
    "escape orbit @xmath147 is infact singular and contained in @xmath109 , see figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "thus the one side of @xmath147 bounds perpendicular periodic families , while the other side is a limit or perpendicular periodic families .",
    "the method of proof also allows to verify the boshernitzan conjecture for an infinite collection of rational right triangles , those where the perpendicular orbits starting at the ( non - right angle ) verteces are simple periodic loops .",
    "theorem [ thm0 ] for irrational triangles this follows immediately from theorem  [ pascal ] since the surface @xmath23 is dense in the full phase space . for rational triangles the result was established in @xcite .",
    "i would like to remark on the assumption @xmath11 .",
    "this is a technical assumption which guarantees that the orbits starting at the endpoints of @xmath105 are simple periodic loops .",
    "this is the key condition which is used in the proof of the theorems .",
