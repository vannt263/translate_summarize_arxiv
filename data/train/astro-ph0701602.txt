    "the tight correlation between the global far - infrared and radio emission from galaxies has been established for over three decades .",
    "early ground - based studies ( van der kruit 1973 ; condon et al .  1982 ) and observations with the infrared astronomical satellite ( _ iras _ , dickey & salpeter 1984 ; de jong et al .  1985",
    ") conclusively established a correlation over a broad range of hubble types and luminosities at low redshifts ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the origin of this correlation is thought to lie in the link between massive stars , which generate far - infrared emission by reheating dust , and supernovae , which accelerate cosmic rays that then generate radio synchrotron radiation ( harwit & pacini 1975 ; condon , 1992 ; xu , lisenfield & volk 1994 ) .",
    "however , alternative mechanisms have also been proposed , including secondary electron production ( radio synchrotron ) from molecular clouds ( far infrared ) .",
    "more recently , by extrapolating observations made with the infrared space observatory ( _ iso _ ) in the mid - infrared ( cohen et al .  2000 ,",
    "garrett 2002 ) and in the sub - millimetre with the scuba instrument , ( carilli & yun 1999 , ivison et al .",
    "2002 ) , it has been argued that the far - infrared / radio correlation extends to @xmath9 .",
    "if confirmed , this suggests that the galaxies at high redshift may share many of the same properties as their low redshift counterparts ; whatever the origin of this relation .    with the greatly enhanced mid - infrared sensitivity provided by the _",
    "satellite , it is now possible to investigate directly the far - infrared / radio correlation at redshifts of order unity . an initial attempt has already been made by appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , using the _ spitzer _ first look survey ( fls ) and the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the flux limits for the fls and vla samples were @xmath10mjy and @xmath11mjy respectively .",
    "although limited by the availability of spectroscopic redshifts , appleton et al . were able to demonstrate a good correlation between the 24@xmath1 m and 20 cm flux for objects with a median @xmath12 extending out to @xmath13 .",
    "their analysis was limited by the relative brightness of the radio flux limit , which was a factor of three brighter than that corresponding to the 24@xmath1 m limit , based on the observed far - infrared / radio flux ratio .    in this analysis",
    ", we extend the flux limits to which the far - infrared / radio correlation may be studied by a further factor of three at 24@xmath1 m and by a factor of 20 at 20 cm , using the _ spitzer _ wide field survey ( swire ) and the technique of stacking ( see e.g. wals et al .",

    "the areas covered are chosen to be matched to those covered by the swire survey ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) as well as enabling optical spectroscopy with instruments such as the anglo australian telescope 2-degree field .",
    "a total of 360 hours integration has been obtained on the cdfs , and of 234 hours in the elais . in each field ,",
    "28 and 20 pointings ( each with a mean integration of 13 hours ) have been mosaiced together to provide an area of approximately 1.6 deg @xmath18 2.2  deg in the cdfs , and of 1.6deg @xmath18 1.6deg in the elais .",
    "the data were calibrated and imaged using miriad ( sault et al .",
    "1995 ) following the procedures in the miriad cookbook for high dynamic range observations .",
    "in particular , multi - frequency clean had to be used to account for the high fractional bandwidth of 15 per cent .",
    "the mean rms noise in the images is 30@xmath1jy , and is limited not by integration time but by sidelobes arising from strong sources in ( cdfs ) or just outside ( elais ) the imaged areas ( shown in fig  [ cdfs ] ) .",

    "this result rules out models such as that of wall et al .",
    "( 1986 ) , who propose that the low - flux radio sources are low - luminosity radio galaxies .",

    "2003 ) based on extrapolations of models which fit the mid - infrared / radio correlation at brighter fluxes .",
    "the results presented here show that , in broad terms , this same correlation holds for sources down to microjy levels , thus extending the range over which the correlation is known to hold by some two orders of magnitude in flux density .",
    "however , the data do not immediately tell us whether these galaxies are high - luminosity high - redshift star - forming galaxies or low - luminosity low - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "most previous studies of the radio - fir correlation have measured @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is an integrated far infrared flux typically obtained from _ iras _ fluxes using a weighting algorithm e.g. @xmath35 . such studies , whether on radio - selected ( condon et al .",
    "1991 ) , infrared - selected ( condon & broderick 1991 ) , or distance - limited ( helou et al .",
    "1985 ) samples , all broadly give the same value of @xmath36 .    here",
    "we measure @xmath37 , rather than @xmath38 , so to compare our results with previous authors requires a conversion factor between @xmath6 and @xmath38 , which will depend sensitively on the sed of the parent population and the mips filter response , and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , @xmath6 has been measured by appleton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who obtain a ( non - k - corrected ) value of @xmath39 , which differs significantly from our measured value of @xmath40 .",
    "although our value of @xmath41 is derived from stacked data , whilst the appleton value is derived from detected sources , this disrepancy is nevertheless a surprising result and merits further scrutiny .",
    "first , we note that the simulations discussed in section 3 have eliminated the possibility that it might be caused by an error in our imaging , stacking , or source - fitting algorithms or software .",
    "another possibility is that the discrepancy might be caused by a difference in k - correction between our analysis and that of appleton et al .",
    "we have made no k - correction to this flux ratio because we have neither redshifts nor detailed spectral information on these objects in either the infrared or radio bands .",
    "appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) explicitly demonstrate that individual k - corrections have little systematic effect on the mean trend of @xmath6 as a function of redshift at @xmath42 .",
    "based on spectral energy distribution modelling in the infrared , and an assumed synchrotron spectral index of @xmath43 in the radio , appleton et al .",
    "found that this increased the uncorrected value of @xmath39 by only 0.10.2 , depending on the sed template used",
    ".    however , fadda et al .  ( 2006 ) demonstrate that the k - correction arising from the pah emission features entering the 24@xmath1 m band at higher redshifts ( @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) could be much greater .",
    "fadda et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that emission in the 24@xmath1 m band could be enhanced by as much as a factor 2 ( @xmath46 ) for an m82 starburst galaxy template .",
    "thus it is possible that k - corection provides a partial explanation for the differences seen with appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , if the bulk of the population used in the stacking analysis are high redshift starbursts . for k - correction to fully explain the difference our sources would need to be dominated by high redshift ( @xmath9 ) starburst galaxies with pah emission features approximately double that seen in some of the most intense star - forming galaxies locally .    a more mundane source for the discrepancy may arise from the different sample selection effects",
    "we note that @xmath6 derived by appleton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is based on radio detections of infrared sources .",
    "our values derived here are for all infrared sources , irrespective of radio flux .",
    "thus a lower coefficient could be explained by a population of sources with low radio - infrared flux ratios which have previously not been included in the study of radio - selected samples because they fall below the radio flux limit for the sample .",
    "indeed , we note that gruppioni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the mid - infrared ( 15@xmath1m)/radio ( 20 cm ) luminosity correlation for mid - infrared sources with radio detections was a factor of two higher than the correlation for all sources with upper limits for radio luminosities included in the analysis .",
    "however , if this were to be the case we would still have to explain the difference between these lower @xmath6 ( passband issues notwithstanding ) and those fir / radio correltions derived from _",
    "iras _ sources with complete radio detections ( yun , reddy & gruppioni 2003 ) .    [ gal ]     [ mips ] m images for four cdfs source with @xmath47mjy and",
    "no detected 20 cm emission .",
    "note the complex / extended morphology in the majority of cases , broadly consistent with the population at this flux level and @xmath6 value.,title=\"fig : \" ]    to investigate this further , we plot in fig . 7",
    "a composite of the radio / infrared fluxes derived for both the individual radio - detected sources in the cdfs ( norris et al .  2006 ) and the stacked images derived in this paper .",
    "the sample of detected sources includes both agn and star forming galaxies , resulting in a significant tail in fig . 7 extending to high radio - fir ratios , and precluding a measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "however there is a significant absence of sources below @xmath48 , ( the radio - fir relation found by appleton et al . ) , which appears to mark a lower bound to the distribution . in particular , there is a significant absence of sources along the line extrapolated from our stacked data .",
    "indeed , at the higher ( @xmath49mjy ) fluxes nearly all non - stellar 24@xmath1 m sources are detected at 20 cm in the cdfs field ( @xmath50mjy ) .    as a further consistency check of our result we derived the infrared - radio correlation based on radio and infrared fluxes measured at the positions of individual sources used in our stacking sample .",
    "most of the radio sources will lie below the formal 5@xmath51 detection limit and consequently their fluxes will be subject to large errors .",
    "nevertheless the ensemble properties of the distribution will be robust . in each infrared bin",
    "used above we computed the median value of the fluxes in each bin and made the fit to those points .",
    "for the cdfs and elais the resulting fits were respectively :    @xmath52 @xmath53    the median estimator to the individual points in both fields gave a consistent slope to that obtained from the stacked images .",
    "we also modelled the effects of a population with a bimodal radio - infrared flux ratio ; half of the population having @xmath30 and half having @xmath54 ( based on the cdfs mips flux distributions ) .",
    "although the stacked images of this simulated population give similar results to that obtained with the real data , the distribution of the individual simulated population flux values is visibly bimodal in a scatter plot of the individual source fluxes ( fig .  8 upper panel ) and clearly different from a similar plot using the real data ( fig",
    ".  8 lower panel )    nevertheless , we are faced with the conundrum that , whatever the distribution , the mean observed @xmath6 value is greater than that of any modelled sed .",
    "some of the optically - brightest cdfs sources with the most extreme @xmath6 values are relatively low redshift galaxies ( fig .",
    ". however , most of these radio - weak sources have no direct optical counterpart at photographic plate limits ( @xmath55mag ) . the majority of the objects at high @xmath24 flux end of the correlation @xmath56mjy and show extended or complex morphologies in their @xmath57 m images ( fig .",
    ". this would be consistent with a population dominated by actively star - forming galaxies at moderate redshifts .",
    "to date , optical spectroscopy has been obtained for @xmath58 130 swire sources in the cdfs ( norris et al .",
    "the median redshift is @xmath59 with a tail to higher redshift @xmath60 , exclusively composed of broad emission line active galactic nuclei at @xmath61 .",
    "however , this redshift distribution is strongly influenced by optical selection effects  the vast majority of the objects with measured redshifts having relatively bright optical magnitudes ( @xmath62 mag ) .",
    "we find that the population of objects at @xmath1jy flux densities obey a radio-24@xmath1 m correlation which indicates that they are powered by star formation rather than by agn , but their mean value of @xmath6 is inconsistent with previous results .",
    "we therefore propose that at microjy sensitivity , radio surveys are sampling a different population of objects , or objects with an intrinsically different value of @xmath6 , from objects seen in the local universe .",
    "nevertheless , we acknowledge that the change obtained here for the mean value of @xmath6 occurs when we move from the use of discrete radio ( @xmath63 ) detections to fainter fluxes . despite extensive testing and simulations we can not rule out some unsuspected selection effect which may also contribute to this result .",
    "a partial explanation of the discrepancy may arise from the k - correction , but only if the population is dominated by extreme starburst galaxies at @xmath64 or @xmath45 .",
    "another explanation for at least part of the discrepancy may arise from the radio - selection biases inherent in some previous surveys .",
    "data from high - sensitivity surveys such as atlas will help to resolve such issues .",
