    "it is rare for a condensed matter system to possess only one phase transition , which raises the question of how neighbouring phase transitions affect each other .",
    "there are many possible effects , and here we consider one of them , namely how nucleation associated with one phase transition is affected by the critical point of a second transition . consider a first - order phase transition , transition @xmath0 , which occurs at a temperature @xmath1 . above @xmath1 the high - temperature phase , call it @xmath2 , is the equilibrium phase while below it the low - temperature phase , @xmath3 , is the equilibrium phase .",
    "[ pd ] is a schematic of the temperature axis of the phase diagram .",
    "if we cool the high - temperature phase below @xmath1 then it ceases to be the equilibrium phase . at some degree of supercooling a nucleus of the low temperature phase",
    "will appear and grow into a macroscopic @xmath3 phase .",
    "the initial step , the formation of a nucleus of the @xmath3 phase , is an activated process  a free energy barrier must be surmounted @xcite .",
    "the rate at which nuclei overcome a barrier of height @xmath4 scales as @xmath5 and so this rate is very sensitive to the barrier height @xcite . here",
    "we calculate @xmath4 for nucleation near a critical point of another phase transition , which we call transition @xmath6 .",
    "transition @xmath6 is ising - like .",
    "so , we have two phase transitions : a strongly first order phase transition @xmath0 , whose dynamics we are studying , and a transition with a critical point , transition @xmath6 , which lies at a temperature @xmath7 and so occurs within the @xmath2 phase when it is not the true equilibrium phase . at an ising critical point the thermodynamic functions contain singular power - law terms with exponents which depend only on dimensionality @xcite .",
    "below , we show that @xmath4 also contains a singular power - law term with exponents which depend only on dimensionality .",
    "the singular part of @xmath4 has the same form as that in the order parameter , so for example , it scales with temperature as @xmath8 , where @xmath6 is the usual critical exponent @xcite .",
    "this singular part means that the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to temperature diverges as the critical point is approached : the barrier to nucleation is very sensitive to changes in temperature near the critical point . which is true for _ any _ system with an ising - like critical point .",
    "the scaling analysis here follows on from mean - field calculations performed by the author @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . which in turn followed on from the pioneering simulations of ten wolde and frenkel @xcite who were the first to appreciate that critical fluctuations could reduce @xmath4 near the critical point of a metastable fluid - fluid transition .",
    "the results of the mean - field calculations are consistent with the scaling analysis here ; if we take the equations of the present work and set the exponents to their ( incorrect ) mean - field values we reproduce the exponents found in refs .",
    "finally , see the work of dixit and zukoski @xcite for an alternative approach to nucleation near a critical point ; one where dynamics are explicitly but approximately included .",
    "perhaps the easiest systems in which to observe the effects found here , are mixtures of liquids . there nucleation of either the vapour phase or a crystalline phase may occur near the continuation of a line of critical solution temperatures , i.e. , near to a critical point of liquid - liquid demixing .",
    "a line of critical solution temperatures does not stop when the liquid ceases to be the equilibrium phase but continues into the region where it is metastable with respect to a transition to a vapour or crystalline phase .",
    "it is this continuation that affects nucleation .",
    "the study of nucleation near a critical point was sparked by interest in the nucleation of the crystalline phase of globular proteins @xcite .",
    "at least some globular proteins have a fluid - fluid critical point within the fluid - crystal coexistence region @xcite .",
    "the fact that the predictions made here are universal is very useful with regard to protein crystallisation as the interactions between protein molecules are generally rather poorly understood , particularly before they have been crystallised and their structure determined @xcite .",
    "we know that our predictions will apply to nucleation near any fluid - fluid critical point found in a protein solution , without needing to know anything about the protein - protein interactions .",
    "we will describe the critical point of transition @xmath6 using the standard language of ising spin systems , although of course our results also apply to critical points in fluids .",
    "the order parameter is @xmath9 , the temperature @xmath10 , and the field is @xmath11 and couples to the order parameter as @xmath12 .",
    "the critical point is then at @xmath13 , @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "[ pd ] . for fluid systems",
    "the external field @xmath11 is the chemical potential minus that at coexistence , and @xmath9 is a density difference .",
    "we set the lattice spacing to @xmath15 .",
    "for definiteness we set @xmath9 to be positive in the nucleus .",
    "the symmetry between @xmath16 and @xmath17 means we can do so without loss of generality .",
    "the dynamics of a first - order phase transition starts with nucleation @xcite , where a microscopic nucleus of the new phase first appears .",
    "the nucleus at the top of the barrier , with the highest free energy @xmath4 , determines the rate and so we will consider only this nucleus .",
    "it is generally called the critical nucleus .",
    "note that conventionally the word critical is used to denote both a continuous transition and the nucleus at the top of the barrier although there is no connection between the two uses of the word .",
    "although this terminology is a little unfortunate we will use it here and so we will be studying a critical nucleus near a critical point .    for nucleation at a strongly first - order phase transition ( which transition @xmath0 is assumed to be ) , the nucleus must contain a compact _ core _ of spins near their state in the bulk @xmath3 phase , as only in this state do they have a lower free energy than in the @xmath2 phase . for all strongly first - order transitions , the free energy will be higher for spins intermediate between the two phases , here @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is this core which will grow to form the @xmath3 phase .",
    "see for example refs .",
    "@xcite which discuss the classical theory for nucleation which is based on this observation .",
    "now , this core of spins will perturb the surrounding spins out to a distance of the correlation length @xmath18 . thus , the volume perturbed is of order @xmath19 and so diverges as the critical point is approached .",
    "@xmath20 is the dimensionality .",
    "the volume around the core where @xmath9 is small we term the _ fringe_. as in our earlier mean - field calculations @xcite we split the nucleus into a core and a fringe .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ figschem ] .",
    "as @xmath0 is a strongly first - order transition , the order parameter of transition @xmath6 , @xmath9 , in the core will be of order unity , i.e. , not small , and therefore far above the values of @xmath9 reached by critical fluctuations .",
    "the critical fluctuations will however affect the fringe where @xmath9 is small .",
    "we note that the compact core of spins resembles a small colloidal particle in that it is a compact , roughly spherical object , which interacts with and thus perturbs its surroundings .",
    "the problem of a colloidal particle in a near critical system has been considered , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the core of the nucleus will be much smaller than the correlation length @xmath18 near the critical point as it will be only a few lattice sites across whereas @xmath18 diverges @xcite .",
    "thus , near the critical point , the core is a point - like perturbation which couples to the order parameter @xmath9 .",
    "it will couple to @xmath9 unless this is prevented by a symmetry .",
    "point - like perturbations near a critical point are generic  all point - like perturbations to the order parameter @xmath9 perturb large length - scale critical fluctuations in the same way , differing only in a scale factor . near the critical point where @xmath21 , scale invariance implies that any perturbation of size much less than @xmath18 must cause a order parameter perturbation of the same form , because all such perturbations are simply interrelated by a change of length - scale .",
    "the presence of a nucleus at the origin @xmath22 must therefore produce ( at large distances ) the generic perturbation to @xmath9 . we define the thermal average excess of @xmath23 due to the presence of a nucleus at the origin as @xmath24 where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the thermal average value of @xmath23 when there is ( is not ) a nucleus at the origin .",
    "compare this to the 2-point correlation function , @xmath27 , for the order parameter , defined by @xmath28 note that @xmath27 is the thermal average of @xmath23 if @xmath29 is fixed to 1 .",
    "as a point perturbation is generic for the fluctuations on length scales @xmath30 , the function @xmath31 can only differ from @xmath27 by a scale factor when @xmath32 . calling this scale factor @xmath33 ,",
    "@xmath34 @xmath33 will depend on the properties of the core .",
    "this result has been found before not for a nucleus but for a small colloidal particle immersed in a near - critical fluid @xcite . defining the total excess of @xmath9 due to the presence of the critical nucleus as @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 splitting the integration at @xmath37 which satisfies @xmath38 , and using eq .",
    "( [ mn ] ) for the integrand of the integral for @xmath39 we have @xmath40 now , the response function @xmath41 is equal to the integral over @xmath27 @xcite @xmath42 and it contains a leading order singular part @xmath43 coming from fluctuations on a length - scale of the correlation length @xmath18 , and so coming from those parts of the integral where @xmath44 .",
    "thus the second integral of eq .",
    "( [ ms2 ] ) for @xmath35 contains @xmath43 : @xmath35 is singular at the critical point . near the critical point",
    "@xmath43 dominates @xmath41 and so the term @xmath45 in the second integral of eq .",
    "( [ ms2 ] ) will dominate @xmath35 .",
    "thus , we have for the leading order singularity in @xmath35 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 are scaling functions , and @xmath49 , @xmath6 and @xmath50 are critical exponents .",
    "@xmath51 is the scaling function above the transition , @xmath52 , while @xmath53 is the scaling function below the transition , @xmath54 .",
    "the second equality is obtained by substituting the standard scaling expression for @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "close to the critical point , the total order parameter excess associated with the nucleus , @xmath35 , diverges with the precisely the same scaling behaviour as the order parameter response function , @xmath41 .",
    "having determined the size of the nucleus , we wish to know its free energy .",
    "we start by splitting the free energy barrier into a nonsingular part @xmath55 plus a leading order singular part @xmath4 , @xmath56 the leading order singular part , @xmath57 , of @xmath4 , is expected to have the usual scaling form , of a power of @xmath58 times a function of @xmath59 , @xmath60 with @xmath61 an as yet unknown exponent .",
    "to determine @xmath61 we note that the derivative of the free energy of the system @xmath62 with respect to @xmath11 is , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total order parameter @xmath9 of the system .",
    "thus , as @xmath4 is the free energy with a nucleus at the origin minus that without a nucleus at the origin , then the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath11 is simply the negative of the total order parameter with a nucleus minus that without a nucleus @xcite , @xmath65 this is for the complete @xmath4 .",
    "the leading - order singular term in @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath57 , will yield minus the leading - order singular term in @xmath35 , upon differentiation with respect to @xmath11 @xmath66 the derivative with respect to @xmath11 of scaling functions like @xmath67 , brings an additional @xmath68 factor .",
    "thus for eqs .",
    "( [ fguess ] ) and ( [ dfsdh ] ) to yield the correct exponent @xmath69 for @xmath35 we require that @xmath70 .",
    "using the relation between exponents @xmath71 @xcite we obtain @xmath72 .",
    "so , setting @xmath72 in eq .",
    "( [ fguess ] ) we obtain @xmath73 the singular part of the free energy scales with the same exponent , @xmath6 , as the bulk order parameter .",
    "this is for ising - like systems but we expect that analogous singular terms will be found near critical points of transitions with order parameters which are not scalars , for example in the heisenberg model where the order parameter is a three - dimensional vector .    as @xmath74 ,",
    "@xmath75 at the critical point , and so the universal singular part is zero .",
    "the free energy barrier @xmath4 at the critical point is equal to some non - universal value .",
    "however , as @xmath76 , the derivative of @xmath4 with respect to temperature diverges as @xmath77 as the critical point is approached at @xmath14 .",
    "the signs of the divergences as the critical point is approached from above and below are those of @xmath78 which are unknown .",
    "however , on physical grounds we might expect critical fluctuations to reduce the barrier to nucleation , and this is what is found in the mean - field theory calculations for @xmath79 of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , within mean - field theory it has been found that @xmath80 . if @xmath78 are both positive , then at fixed @xmath14 , the free energy barrier will have a local minimum at @xmath81 . as the derivative of @xmath57 diverges , near the critical point the variation in @xmath4",
    "is dominated by that in @xmath57 , and so if @xmath57 has a minimum at the critical point so does @xmath4 .    along the critical isotherm , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an amplitude and the scaling with @xmath11 is fixed by the requirement that it be the same as that of @xmath9 . from eq .",
    "( [ dfsdh ] ) we see that as @xmath84 then the @xmath11 derivative of @xmath57 must be negative . for",
    "this to be true we must have that @xmath85 .",
    "note that @xmath84 because we set @xmath9 in the core to be @xmath86 , if the nucleating phase has instead @xmath87 , then in that case @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath83 is a function not only of the properties of the critical system but of the nucleating phase . at the critical point",
    "the rate of decrease of @xmath4 ( @xmath89 ) diverges , so near the critical point the nucleation barrier is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath11 .      in the @xmath14 limit , the scaling functions @xmath48 of @xmath43 , eq .  ( [ ms ] ) , simplify @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 are critical amplitudes , and are non - universal .",
    "however , the critical amplitude ratio @xmath93 is universal @xcite .",
    "the fact that not only the exponents but the critical amplitude ratios are universal means that we can even make a universal prediction about the ratio of the size of the nucleus just above the critical point to that just below . if we take the ratio @xmath94 , we see , using eq .",
    "( [ chis2 ] ) , that @xmath95 which is universal . as near the critical point",
    "@xmath46 dominates @xmath35 , we have that near the critical point : 1 ) the excess magnetisation associated with the nucleus is the _ same _ in each of the two coexisting phases at some @xmath96 , and 2 ) that the ratio of @xmath35 at @xmath58 to the common value of the excess @xmath9 in the coexisting phases at @xmath97 is universal . in three dimensions",
    "@xmath98 @xcite so the nucleus is approximately five times bigger @xmath58 above the transition than @xmath97 below . via the nucleation theorem @xcite it is possible to estimate the size of the critical nucleus .",
    "thus measurements on nucleation rates can potentially be used to estimate not only critical exponents but critical amplitude ratios .",
    "now , the singular part of the barrier , @xmath57 , is universal because it originates in long wavelength fluctuations , fluctuations with wavelengths @xmath30 , where the microscopic details of the system are irrelevant .",
    "however , these long wavelength fluctuations are slow , firstly as a direct consequence of them having a long wavelength ( this applies if @xmath9 is a conserved variable @xcite ) , and secondly because as the critical point is approached the free energy becomes a very flat function of the order parameter which reduces the driving force which relaxes fluctuations .",
    "dynamic scaling theory yields for the characteristic relaxation time @xmath100 ( = @xmath101 over the characteristic frequency ) of a small wavevector mode , @xmath102 , near a critical point @xcite @xmath103 the relaxation time of a mode of wavevector @xmath104 at temperature @xmath105 and field @xmath11 .",
    "the exponent @xmath106 is a dynamic scaling exponent .",
    "dynamic scaling exponents depend not only on the symmetry of the order parameter and the dimensionality as the static exponents , @xmath6 , @xmath49 , etc .",
    "do , but also on whether the order parameter @xmath9 is conserved or not .",
    "if @xmath9 is the magnetisation then it can vary locally without transport of @xmath9 and so it is non - conserved , but if @xmath9 is a density difference then as the total number of molecules is conserved it can not vary in a volume of space without transport in or out of that volume , so it is then a conserved variable . in either case @xmath106 is positive . assuming that fluctuations with wavelengths larger than the correlation length can be ignored we have that at a given @xmath105 and @xmath11 , the longest relevant relaxation time is that of a mode of wavevector @xmath107 .",
    "calling the relaxation time of this mode @xmath108 we have , from eq .",
    "( [ taur ] ) , @xmath109 where we have set @xmath14 for simplicity , the generalisation to non - zero fields is easy .",
    "the second line used the scaling for the correlation length @xmath110 for @xmath14 , and the amplitudes @xmath111 .",
    "our expression for the free energy barrier to nucleation , eq .",
    "( [ cnt ] ) , includes a singular part @xmath57 coming from long - wavelength fluctuations .",
    "this singular part is an equilibrium quantity : it is the free energy change of equilibrium fluctuations due to the nucleus .",
    "note that here by equilibrium we mean that the fluctuations in @xmath9 etc .",
    "have relaxed to equilibrium , the system is not at true equilibrium as it is in the @xmath2 phase below @xmath1 .",
    "thus , our expression for the free energy barrier , eq .",
    "( [ cnt ] ) , is only meaningful once a time much larger than @xmath108 has elapsed at that temperature and so the fluctuations in @xmath9 have equilibrated .",
    "however , @xmath108 diverges as the critical point is approached so the nearer we are to the critical point the longer we have to wait before eq .",
    "( [ cnt ] ) gives the correct barrier to nucleation .",
    "for @xmath9 conserved , @xmath112 and so putting in the values for @xmath113 and @xmath114 we have that @xmath108 scales as @xmath115 : it diverges rather rapidly as the critical point is approached . for",
    "@xmath9 not conserved , @xmath106 is close to 2 and so putting in the values for @xmath113 and @xmath114 we have that @xmath108 scales as @xmath116 : it still diverges but more slowly .",
    "so , the closer the critical point is approached the longer is the waiting time before our expressions for the nucleation barrier , and size of the nucleus are valid .",
    "this , together with the effect of gravity on long wavelength fluctuations will limit how closely the critical point can be approached and the behaviour predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ ms ] ) and ( [ cnt ] ) observed .",
    "section [ secm ] considered the case of a nucleus near an ising - like transition , and in which the nucleus couples to the order parameter . in this section",
    "we start by considering nuclei near an ising - like critical point which do not couple to the order parameter , and then move on to consider critical points in other universality classes .",
    "there are results for colloidal particles in fluids near ising - like critical points where the particles do not couple to the order parameter @xcite .",
    "this is so when the two phases which form below @xmath99 are related by symmetry and the nucleus does not discriminate between these two phases .",
    "now , whether or not a nucleus ( or colloidal particle ) couples to the order parameter , it will in general couple to the energy density @xmath117 .",
    "the perturbation to the energy density around a particle / nucleus is given by the energy correlation function . a scaling argument analogous to that in the previous section can be constructed to yield the result that the coupling to the energy density yields a singular part in the free - energy barrier which scales as the energy density @xmath117 , i.e. , @xmath118 where @xmath0 is the specific - heat exponent , and @xmath119 are scaling functions . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) is the appropriate scaling for the energy density .",
    "now , @xmath120 , and so if a nucleus couples to both @xmath9 and @xmath117 then the singular term from the @xmath9 coupling , eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) , will dominate and we can neglect the singularity of eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) : we did this in the previous section .",
    "in general , we always expect the nucleus to couple to the energy density but the resulting singularity , eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) will be dominated by that from the @xmath9 coupling unless the latter is absent in which case eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) should give the dominant singularity in the free energy barrier to nucleation .",
    "note that the temperature derivative of the nucleation barrier @xmath121 .",
    "varies as the heat capacity , i.e. , as @xmath122 at @xmath14 .",
    "so , for a nucleus which does not couple to the order parameter , we still have a singularity in the free - energy barrier , eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) , but it is weak . in three dimensions , @xmath123 and",
    "so the temperature derivative of the free - energy barrier diverges only as @xmath124 at @xmath14 : this weak divergence may be difficult to observe .",
    "also , at @xmath14 , if the nucleus does not couple to @xmath9 , then @xmath125 at @xmath14 by symmetry .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ dfdh ] ) , the field derivative of @xmath126 at @xmath14 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , in fluid systems like protein solutions and liquid mixtures , there is no symmetry available to prevent the coupling of the nucleus to @xmath9 .",
    "so the results of the previous section apply there , and the coupling to the energy density is subdominant .",
    "however , let us consider systems in universality classes other than that of the ising model .",
    "we speculate that our finding of singular terms in the free - energy barrier to nucleation near a critical point is not restricted to systems with a scalar order parameter .",
    "even if the order parameter is , say a two - dimensional unit vector as it is in the universality class of the xy - model @xcite , then the nucleus of a new phase should couple to the critical fluctuations .",
    "for example , the fluid to superfluid transition in liquid @xmath127he is in the xy universality class .",
    "now , the vector order parameter is the phase of a wavefunction and a nucleus of another phase , e.g. , the vapour phase , will not couple to the phase of a quantum mechanical wavefunction : @xmath4 does not depend on the local phase of the wavefunction .",
    "however , there is no reason for the nucleus not to couple to energy fluctuations near the fluid to superfluid transition .",
    "if it does so then @xmath4 will contain a singular term of the form of eq .",
    "( [ fsu ] ) .",
    "the fluid to superfluid transition crosses the liquid - vapour transition @xcite , and so nucleation of the vapour phase can occur near the continuation of the superfluid - fluid transition into conditions of pressure and temperature such that the vapour phase is the equilibrium phase .",
    "however , for the xy model in three dimensions , @xmath0 is ( very small but ) negative which means the heat capacity , and thus the temperature derivative of @xmath4 , has a cusp only : it does not diverge .",
    "this may make proving or disproving our speculation difficult .",
    "we have considered the effect of a critical point on the nucleation of a new phase of another phase transition .",
    "the order parameter associated with the critical point is a scalar , putting the transition in the universality class of the ising model .",
    "the critical point results in power - law singularities in both the free energy barrier to nucleation , @xmath4 , and the size of the nucleus , @xmath35 .",
    "the singular term in @xmath4 has the same scaling as the order parameter , and that in @xmath35 has the scaling of the response function of the order parameter .",
    "thus , for example , as the critical point is approached at zero field , the singular term in @xmath4 varies as @xmath128 , where @xmath6 is the usual critical exponent and @xmath105 is the temperature minus that at the critical point . as @xmath74 , the singular term in the free energy barrier tends to zero as the critical point is approached .",
    "however , derivatives of @xmath4 , both with respect to the temperature and to the external field , diverge as the critical point is approached : the free - energy barrier to nucleation varies rapidly near the critical point .",
    "these predictions are universal , they apply to nucleation in any system in which nucleation of a new phase occurs near a critical point in the universality class of the ising model .",
    "all the above holds given only that the core of the nucleus , where the nucleus resembles the new bulk phase that is nucleating , couples to the order parameter .",
    "it will do so unless prevented by a symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is clearly absent in fluid systems , in which the order parameter is a density and/or composition difference . in the previous section we speculated that there are also singular terms in @xmath4 near critical points in other universality classes . in other universality classes",
    "it is clear that symmetry can prevent coupling to the order parameter , in which case the singularity in @xmath4 will be weaker .",
    "the relaxation time diverges as the critical point is approached , see section [ sec : dyn ] .",
    "thus , in experiment there is a limit to how close the critical point can be approached before the relaxation time becomes prohibitively long .",
    "this may limit the minimum value of @xmath58 that is achievable or it may be limited by some other factor .",
    "for example , the protein lysozyme has a fluid - fluid transition with a critical point within the fluid - crystal coexistence region @xcite , and thus is a candidate for studying nucleation of a non - critical phase , here a crystalline phase , near an ising - like critical point .",
    "far from the critical point the characteristic relaxation time can be estimated as the time a lysozyme molecules takes to diffuse its own diameter .",
    "the single particle diffusion constant of lysozyme @xmath129 @xcite , and its diameter is approximately 4 nm @xcite .",
    "this gives a relaxation time of order @xmath130s .",
    "using this as the order of magnitude of the amplitudes @xmath131 , we have that at @xmath14 , the relaxation time @xmath108 is of order @xmath132s at a temperature @xmath105 .",
    "the exponent of @xmath105 is @xmath133 , with @xmath106 taking its value for a conserved order parameter .",
    "now , assuming careful temperature control the critical temperature can be approached to within , say , @xmath134c .",
    "as the effective interactions between the molecules in solution vary strongly with temperature @xmath134c should correspond to @xmath135 , not @xmath136 as it would for temperature independent interactions . at @xmath137",
    ", we have a relaxation time @xmath138 : still rather short .",
    "thus , in experiments on globular protein molecules like lysozyme , limitations on how well the temperature can be controlled are the limiting factor ; the relaxation time @xmath108 is always well within the range accessible in experiment .",
    "here we consider only homogeneous nucleation , nucleation in the bulk , far from any interface .",
    "heterogeneous nucleation , nucleation at an interface , either with a wall or an impurity , is in fact more common , and is not always an activated process .",
    "classical nucleation theory predicts that for reasonable values of the interfacial tension ( here that between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases ) the @xmath4 will be of the right order for nucleation to occur when the nucleus contains @xmath139 spins . as critical fluctuations change @xmath4 by an amount @xmath140",
