    "if a particular operator with charge @xmath11 does not arise in the effective superpotential due to mechanism  2 , the operator will only appear due to mechanism  3 .",
    "on the other hand , if the superpotential of the full theory is completely generic , mechanism  1 will generate every possible operator with charge @xmath9 consistent with the other symmetries of the theory .",

    "since the @xmath17-term potential is completely flat along this direction , no particular value of @xmath52 is favored .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted and the vevs are fixed by superpotential and supersymmetry breaking operators . if the superpotential operators are small , either because they are higher dimensional or if they have tiny couplings , the potential remains _ almost flat _ along this direction , and the field vev can be very large compared to the scale of supersymmetry breaking .",

    "the only possibility is t=_a^b^a_-b = ^a+b , which is clearly in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath57 .",
    "the operators in the low - energy superpotential are formed much like in the case of a single vev . instead of replacing @xmath48 and @xmath49 with their expectation values , however ,",
    "they are replaced by their expressions from eq .",
    "( [ supergauge ] ) with @xmath59 .",
    "the excitations of @xmath57 around its expectation value are light , and are thus still present in the effective theory . integrating out heavy fields whose masses are proportional to the vevs will also generate operators with powers of @xmath48 and @xmath49 in denominators .",

    "in addition to these operators there are contributions from supersymmetry breaking , but they are generally subleading . the operator hierarchies due to @xmath56 are best understood through an illustration .",
    "below , we derive a model of the @xmath2 term based on these considerations .",

    "eff = ( a+b)^+ _ i^ e^_ew_i .",
    "up to a trivial rescaling and small corrections , the khler potential for @xmath57 is canonical .",
    "if the full theory also has a superpotential , then by gauge invariance it can only be a function of @xmath57 and @xmath154 , but not @xmath58 .",
    "thus , in passing to the effective theory , the procedure of integrating out the vector multiplet ( and in the process the gauge artifact @xmath58 ) only affects the khler potential . the resulting superpotential is simply given by its expression in the full theory with the replacements @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this is the source of the holomorphic insertions described in the text .",
    "the light field corresponding to the almost flat direction appears in the effective theory by expanding @xmath57 about its vev .",
    "the case of a single field obtaining a vev can be treated in the same way .",
    "now there is no flat direction , and the condensing field is eaten by the vector multiplet .",
    "this is manifest if we express the condensing field @xmath5 in the form _",
    "v = e^-iq_v_v , where @xmath159  ( see eq .",
    "( [ qvxi ] ) ) , and then make a supergauge transformation to remove @xmath58 .",
    "the equation of motion for the vector multiplet then gives @xmath160 , up to small corrections of order @xmath161 . by gauge invariance",
    ", @xmath58 can not appear in the full superpotential , so in the effective superpotential @xmath5 is simply replaced by its expectation value .",
    "there is no expansion about this value because there is no flat direction .",
    "when three or more fields develop large vevs , we can again use a similar technique . however , in this case the equation of motion for @xmath162 is typically very complicated , and the effective khler potential need not have the minimal form found in the two vev scenario .",
    "the next step is to consider the effects of the vevs on the superpotential . in the effective theory ,",
    "the flat direction fields such as @xmath57 are expanded about their vevs . by construction ,",
    "these fields have masses parametrically smaller than the vevs . however , the appearance of large expectation values can give rise to large supersymmetric masses for other fields that do not condense .",
    "these heavy fields should also be integrated out .",
    "we show here that the integration out procedure can be performed in such a way that the resulting effective superpotential will be holomorphic in both the light fields and the parameters in the full superpotential , up to higher derivatives and supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "suppose only one chiral superfield @xmath163 develops a large mass due to the vevs .",
    "the full superpotential must therefore be of the form w_full = m^2 - f ( , ) , where @xmath164 denotes the large mass , proportional to the vev , and @xmath165 refers to any field other than @xmath163 . by assumption",
    ", @xmath166 contains no positive dimensional couplings unless they are much smaller than @xmath164 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath163 can be expressed in the form = , [ phisol ] where @xmath167 denotes the khler potential .",
    "we can solve iteratively for @xmath163 by replacing @xmath163 on the right hand side with this relation .",
    "note that each repetition of this procedure always brings in an additional power of @xmath168 , and thus the solution is expected to converge rapidly .",
    "since inverse powers of @xmath164 appear in the solution for @xmath163 , they will also appear in the effective superpotential .",
    "this is the source of the inverse holomorphic insertions ( mechanism  2 ) described in the text .",
    "we claim that to any order in this procedure , the resulting expression for @xmath163 can be written in the form = ( holomorphic ) + ( maybe  non - holomorphic ) , [ form ] where the first term is holomorphic in both the fields and all the superpotential parameters . at lowest order in the @xmath168 expansion we set @xmath169 on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ phisol ] ) and our assertion is clearly satisfied . if we assume that at the @xmath12-th order our claim is true , then inserting eq .",
    "( [ phisol ] ) and expanding , we see that @xmath163 will have the form of eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) at the @xmath170-th order as well .",
    "thus , our assertion follows by induction .",
    "this result is enough to show that the effective superpotential will be holomorphic in the couplings of the full superpotential , up to supersymmetry breaking and higher derivative operators . inserting the full solution for @xmath163 , in the form of eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) , into the superpotential we obtain holomorphic terms without derivatives , as well as terms of the type d^2g()()h(^ ) .",
    "these can be converted into khler potential terms using the fact up to a total derivative , @xmath171 is equivalent @xmath172  @xcite .",
    "putting our solution for @xmath163 into the khler potential , there can also arise terms of the form d^4a()(-)b ( ) = d^2()^2b ( ) , where we have made use of the identity @xmath173 for any chiral superfield @xmath165 .",
    "these higher derivative operators can be non - holomorphic in the parameters of the full superpotential or the vevs , but they are expected to be negligible at low energies .",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking can also be included in this procedure by treating the coefficients in the full theory as constant superfields with non - zero auxiliary components .    up to one subtlety",
    ", it is not hard to generalize this result to many large mass terms . in this case",
    ", the full superpotential can be written in the form w_full = _ i_ij_j - f ( , ) , [ wfull ] where , again , @xmath166 contains no large couplings with positive mass dimension , and @xmath174 . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that the elements of @xmath175 are all either of order the large vev scale @xmath164 or zero , and that for a given @xmath176 there is at least one value of @xmath177 for which @xmath178 .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath179 now become _ ij_j = + .",
    "if @xmath180 , the mass matrix has no small eigenvalues , and we can take ( holomorphic ) linear combinations of the equations of motion such that we end up with _",
    "i = , where @xmath181 is a rational holomorphic function of the @xmath175 of order @xmath164 and has a well - defined spurious charge , @xmath182 is a linear combination of the @xmath183 , and @xmath184 is a linear combination of the @xmath185 .",
    "this expression is holomorphic up to the @xmath186 term , and therefore our previous argument applies .",
    "this procedure breaks down when the matrix @xmath187 has an eigenvalue that is zero or much smaller than the large mass scale @xmath164 .",
    "this may be due to a symmetry , or the result of an accidental cancellation .",
    "either way , this implies that at least one linear combination of the @xmath179 is a light degree of freedom that should not be integrated out . to identify these light states ,",
    "we need only find the ( approximate ) null space of @xmath187 .",
    "the resulting null vectors will correspond to holomorphic linear combinations of the @xmath179 with well - defined spurious charges that remain light in the effective theory . by taking holomorphic linear combinations of the fields ,",
    "it is possible to form a new field basis comprised of the null vectors and some other non - null combinations . in this basis",
    "we can integrate out the non - massless fields and apply our previous arguments .",
    "the main result of this section is that up to supersymmetry breaking and higher derivative interactions , the procedure of integrating out heavy chiral superfields yields an effective superpotential that is holomorphic in the light fields as well as all the parameters ( including the vevs ) present in the full superpotential .",
    "non - holomorphic parameter dependences can only appear in higher - derivative interactions in the effective superpotential or from supersymmetry breaking .",
    "( [ phisol ] ) also shows that the integration - out procedure can generate inverse - holomorphic insertions of the vev ( or large mass ) in the effective superpotential .    as a simple example of this process , consider a model with a single heavy chiral field @xmath163 of mass @xmath164 and minimal khler potential , interacting with the light chiral fields @xmath165 through the superpotential  @xcite w = m^2 + w_1()+w_0 ( ) .",
    "the classical solution for @xmath163 is = -(1-)^-1 .",
    "replacing @xmath163 by this solution , the low energy effective action becomes s_eff = d^4xd^2d^2| k_eff+where k_eff & = & k_light+ w_1^ ( 1 -)^-1w_1 , + w_eff & = & w_0()+ w_1 ( 1 -)^-1 w_1 .",
    "the first two mechanisms described in the text are illustrated in the above expressions .",
