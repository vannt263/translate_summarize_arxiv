    "targets of cosmological investigations during the last decade have largely shifted from the global , geometrical properties of the universe to the detailed contents thereof , particularly the origin and evolution of structure from smooth initial conditions . of the components added since the decoupling of matter and radiation , stars are the most easily observable feature ( emitting the most electromagnetic energy ) and of the greatest historical significance . approximately @xmath10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the baryons of the universe have condensed out into stars at the current epoch , and the time history of the process whereby this occurred is the subject of intense study at present . what is not widely realized is that there are three independent approaches by which this study can be pursued :    1 .",
    "we can use the universe directly as a time - machine : in areas of the sky like the hubble deep field @xcite , attempts have been made to analyze the past light - cone .",
    "the rate of transformation of gas into stars is measured as a function of the look - back time or redshift , which produces what has been called the `` madau diagram '' @xcite .",
    "there are three major uncertainties involved in this diagram : ( 1 ) dust obscuration ; ( 2 ) relation between emission and star formation rate ( sfr ) , which includes the uncertainty in the initial mass function ( imf ) ; ( 3 ) faint - end slope of the luminosity function , especially at high - redshift . all of these three contribute roughly on the same order .",
    "recent observational estimates at @xmath11 suggest a decline in sfr with increasing redshift @xcite , but due to uncertainties in dust extinction for ultra - violet ( uv ) light and the faint - end slope of the luminosity function , the trend does not seem to be inconsistent with being constant at @xmath12 ( see also figure  2 of * ? ? ?",
    "2 .   the second method predated the direct method outlined above .",
    "it uses the fossil record from our own and other galaxies to catalog stars of different ages and to , by an essentially demographic investigation , unravel the history of star formation in the local universe using the theory of stellar evolution . when direct age estimates are not available , as is the case for external galaxies , color distributions can provide a useful proxy to their history , distinguishing between systems with and without ongoing star formation activity , although there are degeneracies among age , amount of stars formed , metallicity , and imf .",
    "this method was pioneered by @xcite .",
    "here one makes a simple ansatz for the star formation history  chosen in the quoted paper to be as a simple declining exponential  and an imf , and then computes , via the standard theories of stellar evolution and stellar atmospheres , the evolving spectral output from the assemblage of stars .",
    "they found that one could easily and plausibly simulate the observed colors of different types of stellar systems .",
    "we will update the quantitative input to this theory , leaving the essential basis unchanged , and find that this `` fossil '' model fits with uncanny accuracy ( given the simplicity of the method ) modern observations as obtained by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "we will then use sdss results to determine the parameters of the fossil model .",
    "3 .   the third method is to attempt to solve the problem by _ ab initio _ theory .",
    "one takes the initial conditions from the observed cosmic microwave background radiation , adopts a favorite cosmological model , e.g. , the standard concordance @xmath13 cold dark matter ( cdm ) model @xcite , combines this with the standard physical equations of gravity , hydrodynamics , atomic physics , radiative transfer , _ etc .",
    "_ , and simulates the history of the universe by numerical integration , obtaining as the most important by - product the history of star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one could also employ the so - called semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where a dark - matter halo merger - tree , either constructed using the extended press - schechter formalism @xcite or n - body simulations , is supplemented with a set of equations to model transformation of gas into stars within virialized dark matter halos .    if the observational errors are too significant or the theoretical modeling in error , these three independent approaches might not agree with one another when they should .",
    "we need to pay particular attention to the errors that are involved in various observations .",
    "the quantities at near zero redshift are usually measured without too serious systematic errors . on the other hand , high redshift observations , such as those of star formation rates",
    "are subject to large systematic uncertainties from the obscuration and the faint - end slope of luminosity functions .",
    "therefore , we take the attitude that we constrain the three approaches with zero - redshift quantities , while high - redshift observations are used to examine the consistency within allowed errors .",
    "we also note that there are some uncertainty such as imf , but these uncertainties are known and we can see how they propagate to our calculations or even constrain those uncertainties . with understanding those uncertainties , we can conclude that the agreement of the three approaches is in fact good .",
    "in addition , there is an independent check of all of these approaches .",
    "each approach predicts two numbers : ( 1 ) the local bolometric electromagnetic energy output per unit volume @xmath14 [ erg sec@xmath4 @xmath15 and ( 2 ) the local energy density @xmath16 [ erg @xmath15 , which is measured as the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) . the first number @xmath14 provides a measure of the current star formation rate , while @xmath16 constrains the integral of all past star formation .",
    "the local energy output provides the normalization of the first two quoted approaches and consequently can not be used as an independent check , but the ebl provides an independent test of the three approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "fossil ] we describe the fossil approach characterized by delayed exponential decay models of cosmological star formation and investigate the resulting color and mean age as a function of characteristic decay time and metallicity . as a result",
    ", we construct the ` fossil ' model using two components , bulge and disk , based on the observed colors of galaxies . in section  [ sec : sfr ] we consider the star formation history , as predicted by the fossil model and other _ ab initio _ theoretical models , and compare it with what is inferred from observation . in section  [ sec : omegastar ] we discuss the stellar mass density , a time integrated version of the star formation history , which is taken as a consistency test .",
    "we then compute the ebl in section  [ sec : ebl ] to study whether what is expected from the star formation history is consistent with observations .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "when necessary , we adopt a cosmological model with parameters @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter . where @xmath19 is not explicit , @xmath20 is assumed .",
    "@xcite showed that the colors of galaxies can be reproduced well by simple exponentially decaying star formation histories , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the characteristic decay time . here",
    "we revisit their model with a modern perspective . throughout this paper , we take @xmath23 to be the epoch of the big bang .",
    "the original model of @xcite has the disadvantage that one has to assume the onset time of star formation by hand , increasing the number of free parameters .",
    "therefore we adopt the delayed exponential model , @xmath24 this model has a desirable feature that the sfr vanishes at @xmath23 , and it has a peak at @xmath25 followed by an exponential tail with a characteristic time - scale @xmath22 .",
    "the model with a very small value of @xmath22 resembles the instantaneous burst at @xmath23 , and the one with @xmath26 ( hubble time ) resembles the model with a constant sfr .",
    "the delayed exponential model has the same minimal number of free parameters as the @xcite model , a time - scale @xmath22 and a normalization @xmath27 .",
    "good agreement with other approaches , as we will show later , justifies the use of this functional form for the fossil model .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfr_tau ] shows the delayed exponential models of star formation history as functions of cosmic time ( panel [ @xmath28 ) and redshift ( panel [ @xmath29 ) for different values of @xmath22 as described in the caption .",
    "the normalization @xmath27 is adjusted so that the integral of the sfr , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the critical mass density and @xmath32 is the current age of the universe .",
    "the _ thick blue solid _ line is a composite two population model with @xmath33gyr and 4.5gyr which will be described below .",
    "we note that the integral of sfr ( equation  [ [ eq : norm ] ] ) is not equal to the stellar mass density observed today because of gas recycling , i.e. , gas lost by aging stars .",
    "the recycling fraction @xmath34 , defined to be the ratio of the amount of recycled gas to the total amount of gas that was initially converted into stars , depends on the imf and is a function of time .",
    "we show the recycling fraction in figure  [ fig : recyc ] computed using the population synthesis model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bclib03 ) .",
    "this shows @xmath35 at @xmath36gyr for the @xcite imf integrated from 0.01 to 100@xmath37 .",
    "we applied the correction for brown dwarfs that reduces @xmath34 from bclib03 by a factor of 0.94 . ] .",
    "in other words , approximately 55% of the initial gas remains in stars and stellar remnants ( 45% in shining stars and @xmath38% in remnants , i.e. , white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes , for which bclib03 assumes the mass , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively . ) therefore the normalization given by equation  ( [ eq : norm ] ) corresponds to the stellar mass density @xmath41 .",
    "we note that the recycling fraction of the ssp for the salpeter imf ( @xmath42 ) is @xmath43 at @xmath36gyr .",
    "we then compute the colors of galaxies for each model using bclib03 with the chabrier imf .",
    "the delayed exponential models give @xmath44 and @xmath45 colors as shown in figure  [ fig : colcol]a at @xmath46gyr .",
    "the three lines stand for metallicities : @xmath47 ( _ black open squares _ ) , 1.0 ( _ blue solid triangles _ ) , and 2.5 ( _ red open triangles _ ) , with @xmath22 varying along the line from top ( 0.1 gyr ) to bottom ( 10 gyr ) as indicated in the legend .",
    "also shown as contours is the color distribution of sdss galaxies taken from figure  7 of @xcite .",
    "the histogram ( normalized arbitrarily ) of the sdss galaxy color projected onto each axis is shown in figure  [ fig : colcol]b , with double gaussian fits by eye .",
    "the two rectangular boxes delineated with dots indicate the locations of the gaussian peaks with the width twice the dispersion : @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the blue peak , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 for the red peak .",
    "much has been said of the bimodal color distribution seen in the local galaxies from the sdss @xcite .",
    "the two distinct distributions correspond to non - star forming and star - forming galaxies , but roughly also to the redder spheroid - dominated component and the bluer disk galaxies .",
    "this is the concept first noticed by @xcite in his proposal of the two population model .",
    "he also pointed out that the two types of stellar populations had been recognized as early as 1926 by @xcite .",
    "we represent the peaks of sdss galaxy color distribution with two parameters @xmath52 .",
    "figure  [ fig : colcol]a shows that the models with @xmath33gyr and 4.5gyr fit the colors of the spheroid and disk components reasonably well , respectively , and the variation of metallicity gives a further tuning .",
    "we find that it is difficult to realize the colors @xmath53 with bclib03 even when we push the metallicity to @xmath54 , which is unlikely to be a representative of spheroid component even if the most massive elliptical galaxies may have such a high metallicity .",
    "we present the stellar mass weighted mean metallicity for spheroids ( early type galaxies and bulges of disk galaxies ) of different morphological types in table  [ table : bulge ] , as calculated in appendix  [ sec : bulge_metal ] . as a result",
    ", we construct a composite ` fossil ' model  we call it fossil because it is based on the fossil evidence in the present universe , i.e. , colors of galaxies  with the parameters ( @xmath55 , z/{z_{\\odot } } ) = ( 1.5 , 1.5)$ ] for the spheroid component and @xmath56 for the disk component . into a three dimensional color space by adding another color as a z - axis , and assign a set of parameters ( @xmath57 ) to every grid cell in the 3-d color space . that would be a more smooth , continuous representation of stellar mass distribution in the color space . ]",
    "these parameters are indicated by the _ asterisks _ in figure  [ fig : colcol]b . the blue asterisk for the disk component is located at the center of the box , but the red asterisk for the spheroid is slightly off to the corner .",
    "the mass - weighted mean metallicity of the spheroid component we obtain in table  [ table : bulge ] is @xmath58 , but in order to keep the red asterisk within the dotted box in figure  [ fig : colcol]b , we choose to adopt @xmath59 for the spheroid component .",
    "next , we determine the normalization of the two components . we choose to normalize each component by requiring a match of the energy output in @xmath60- and @xmath61-bands with observations ( see appendix  [ sec : fossil_norm ] ) .",
    "our normalization corresponds to the bulge(spheroid)-to - disk stellar mass ratio @xmath62 , or equivalently @xmath63 .",
    "an alternative method to determine the normalization uses the bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio and the mass - to - light ratio for each morphological type of galaxies , as outlined in the caption of table  [ table : bulgetodisk ] ; this gives @xmath64 , or @xmath65 .",
    "given the uncertainties involved , we consider the bulge stellar mass fraction of @xmath66% to be observationally allowed . for this work",
    "we adopt 57% obtained in appendix  [ sec : fossil_norm ] , but the exact value is not important to the major conclusions .    figure  [ fig : age ] shows the mass - weighted mean stellar age for the delayed exponential model , calculated as @xmath67 the mean age of disk stars ( @xmath68gyrs ) turns out to be @xmath69gyrs , which is consistent with the observational estimate of @xmath70 gyrs @xcite .",
    "we note that our estimate includes the stellar remnants .",
    "had one omitted the contribution from stars that died in the history of the universe , then the mean age would be younger by approximately 0.8gyr , as indicated by the arrows .",
    "the main properties of our fossil model at the present epoch are summarized in tables  [ table : fossil ] and [ table : params ] .",
    "it may be helpful to note that the historical development of the present distribution of galaxies is of no import for the fossil model .",
    "it makes no difference at all to the accounting if we had dry , wet , or no mergers .",
    "all that matters is that the local sdss inventory of a representative volume enables us to estimate the age distribution of star formation .",
    "in figure  [ fig : sfr ] , we show the cosmic sfr density as a function of redshift .",
    "the _ blue solid _ line is the fossil model described in the previous section , and the _ black short - dash long - dash _ line shows the result of a new eulerian tvd hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "this simulation has a comoving box size of @xmath71 and @xmath72 hydrodynamic mesh , and the code is similar to the one used by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the physical cell size is @xmath73 .",
    "the mean baryonic mass per cell for this simulation is @xmath74 and the dark matter particle mass is @xmath75 ( @xmath76 particles ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath77 .",
    "the tvd result is extracted from the simulation without additional processing except for the boxcar smoothing over @xmath78 bins in the redshift axis .",
    "the amount of gas converted into stars is a direct output of the simulation , so there is no uncertainty as to stellar imf and no freedom for the normalization . for the details on the star formation and supernova ( sn ) feedback prescription , we refer the readers to @xcite .",
    "we also consider two other models : one from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* h&s model ) who derived an analytic approximation for the sfr history as a function of redshift based on their cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",

    "we apply this correction to most of the data ( after removing the corrections by individual authors ) , keeping in mind that varying dust extinction as a smooth function of redshift is needed to obtain more reliable estimates of sfr .",

    "we note that uncertainties for @xmath111 could be much larger than those represented here , while those for lower redshift are probably not too large since dust extinction is constrained well with the use of balmer lines .    with large uncertainties we discussed in mind",

    "all estimates agree with each other to within about a factor of two , which is also the size of the scatter in the data .",
    "we see some declining trend of the sfr in the sa model at @xmath112 , which contrasts to the other numerical _ ab initio _ models and the fossil model that show a roughly constant rate of star formation .",
    "our argument given here should be understood in the sense that if observations would receive too large systematic errors , the consistency with the two other approaches is endangered .",
    "we also underline the conclusion from the fossil model that the spheroidal component formed primarily at high - redshift ( @xmath113 ) , and the majority of the disk stars formed at low - redshift ( @xmath114 ) .",

    "a note on the uncertainty due to our poor understanding of star formation is appropriate .",
    "the theoretical calculations are most secure in their predictions of the sfr , while the prediction of the electromagnetic output ( and the stellar mass density to some extent ) do depend on assumptions concerning the stellar imf .",
    "the observational measurements are done for the electromagnetic output and sfr is derived by assuming an imf , therefore the observational estimates of sfr suffers from the uncertainty in the assumed imf .",
    "further uncertainty is expected from dust extinction .",
    "this is particularly important when we deal with far uv light .",
    "we also remark that the star formation rate in the simulations could depend on the details of the sn feedback prescriptions .",

    "the strength of the feedback was set based on the energetic argument of sn explosion and was also calibrated against various observations such as the star formation rate of lyman break galaxies , metallicities of the ly@xmath115 forest and intra - cluster gas , and the galactic wind speeds observed in starburst galaxies .",
    "the current spatial resolution of the tvd simulation ( physical cell size of @xmath73 ) is not adequate to resolve the details of the inner structure of galaxies , but the overall star formation rate can be simulated with some confidence as the energetics are faithfully simulated on scales slightly larger than the real galaxies .",

    "we use the bolometric electromagnetic output to minimize uncertainties due to corrections for dust obscuration .",

    "note that the energy density in the range of the gap , @xmath153 m is expected to be small from the observations of the ebl .",

    "this yields @xmath156 .",
    "being conservative on the error , we adopt @xmath157 as our estimate of the bolometric luminosity density at @xmath5 , which is shown in figure  [ fig : bolum ] .",
    "this estimate agrees with that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig.15 ) .",
    "it is interesting that there is no discrepancy amongst the models and between the models and observations at @xmath5 , while the model predictions are rather divergent to one order of magnitude at high redshift .      from the bolometric luminosity density shown in figure  [ fig : bolum ] ,",
    "we compute the total ebl using equation  ( [ eq : ebl ] ) as a function of redshift for each model of cosmic star formation history",
    ". our calculation does not include the contribution from agn , which amounts to 7% , as estimated in nagamine et al .",
    "( 2006 , in preparation ) .",
    "the model predictions are all convergent on @xmath158 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 at @xmath5 , which are to be compared with the observation , @xmath159=42 - 135 $ ] nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 quoted above .",
    "this indicates that the models are consistent with the observation only at its lower edge , suggesting that the current ebl observations might still be contaminated from non - cosmological sources , whereas the integration over resolved sources yields the value theoretically expected .",
    "the model prediction would even undershoot the observations if the salpeter imf were adopted .",
    "we may have another look at this problem by considering the ratio of the ebl to the bolometric luminosity density at @xmath5 .",
    "we define the dimensionless parameter @xmath160}{{j_{\\rm bol}}\\ , [ l_{\\odot , { \\rm bol}}\\ , { { \\rm\\,mpc}}^{-3 } ] } ,   \\label{eq : eta}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 is the hubble time .",
    "this parameter compares the ebl with the luminosity density multiplied by the hubble time , and the advantage is that it is independent of uncertainties in the stellar imf provided that it does not vary as a function of time . from figures  [ fig : bolum ] and [ fig : ebl ] , we compute @xmath162 , as shown in figure  [ fig : eta ] .",
    "the results are indicated by arrows , and the solid line shows @xmath162 as a function of @xmath22 for the delayed exponential models .",
    "they are compared with the observation indicated by shades that ranges from @xmath163 to 3.11 from equations ( [ eq : obsebl ] ) and ( [ eq : jbol ] ) .",
    "all models result in @xmath164 , which is consistent with only the lower part of the apparently observed range .",
    "therefore , the problem is imf independent .",
    "the evidence we have discussed in the previous sections indicate that we now have reasonable understanding of the cosmic star formation history .",
    "there are , however , two items that do not fit well to the scenario .",
    "they are the stellar mass density at @xmath124 and the ebl from direct measurements of sky .",
    "we showed that the observationally derived stellar mass densities at @xmath165 are significantly smaller than the prediction of all the models , while the models agree well with the observed sfr up to @xmath166 .",
    "this means that the observational data of sfr and stellar mass density are inconsistent with each other .",
    "the integration of sfr , model or observation , gives the correct stellar mass density at @xmath5 , which is a strong constraint .",
    "hence , this is clearly an observational problem that observations underestimated the stars locked in galaxies at @xmath124 .",
    "is it possible that the estimates of the stellar mass density are correct at all redshift and the sfr is mis - estimated ?",
    "this is unlikely , because , to give the curve of the observed stellar mass density at @xmath124 , sfr must decline sharply from @xmath167 to higher redshift while the sfr density @xmath168 is substantially higher than is measured .",
    "therefore , we may ascribe the problem to underestimates of the stellar mass density at @xmath124 , presumably from poor understanding of the optical / nir luminosity functions for sub - luminous galaxies ..    the observation of ebl harbors another problem .",
    "all model results are consistent with the ebl only when we take the value obtained by integration of resolved sources , in _ both _ optical and infrared bands . in the optical band ,",
    "direct measurements @xcite give the ebl 3 times that from integration of resolved sources @xcite .",
    "this factor becomes 5 in the infrared ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the directly measured ebl in either of the cases gives too bright a flux to be accounted for .",
    "this conclusion does not depend on cosmological theories , nor on the imf .",
    "it is a result of requiring consistencies between stellar mass density today and the light that has been emitted by those stars with subsidiary information concerning the star formation history inferred from the madau diagram .",
    "therefore this is also an observational problem possibly due to insufficient subtraction of the zodiacal light ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally there is an inconsistency between the observed value of the luminosity density and the observed ebl for any plausible star formation history .",
    "one may argue for the possibility that ebl in the infrared is actually bright as a result of emission from high - redshift stars which are not included in our modeling .",
    "we consider that this is unlikely , since we do not find at @xmath5 extra stars that were responsible for such emission at high - redshift , and the amount of stars at @xmath5 is well documented .",
    "if there were very massive stars such as population iii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these objects would die quickly and will not be counted as stars at the present epoch .",
    "however there are several difficulties with this hypothesis , such as much higher sfr at @xmath169 than at @xmath170 @xcite , possibility of over - enriching the intergalactic medium by metals @xcite , physically unrealistic absorption - corrected spectra of distant tev blazars @xcite , and overproduction of soft x - ray background @xcite .",
    "we have considered three physically motivated approaches : one with _ ab initio _ theoretical models that are constrained basically by the observation of wmap at @xmath171 , another with the fossil model that uses theory of stellar evolution constrained by the sdss observation at @xmath172 , and yet another purely from observations at @xmath173 .",
    "we considered various physical quantities that witness the star formation history : stellar mass density , luminosity density , bolometric luminosity density and ebl , and we found a general agreement among results from these three approaches within the errors the current observations indicate .",
    "in particular , we found that the exceedingly simple fossil model having two populations with parameters adjusted to the sdss observation  an update of the @xcite model  provides a very effective description of the star formation history predicted by _",
    "ab initio _ theoretical models , and it also exhibits a good fit to the suite of tests we have applied .",
    "the only exception was in the stellar mass density at high redshift , where not only the fossil model but all models predict higher values than the observationally derived ones .",
    "the observational results do not look consistent with what are inferred from the empirical madau plot .",
    "this is not a matter of normalization of the star formation histories shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr ] , since the data on stellar mass density at @xmath5 are now well converged , and they are consistent with the integral of the sfr when the gas recycling is taken into account ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if the dust extinction effect were significantly weaker than what we adopted here and the normalization of the sfr history were brought down in such a way that the integral of the sfr is consistent with the current data on stellar mass density at @xmath174 , such a sfr history would be inconsistent with the measured stellar mass density at @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we regard the disagreement in the stellar mass density at @xmath174 between the models and observations as an observational problem .",
    "we also noted that the predictions of the ebl from the models all converged at the lower edge of the best current observations , giving @xmath7 .",
    "this implies that the true ebl flux is presumably close to the value obtained by integrating over resolved sources .    before proceeding further",
    ", we should ask if an incorrect modeling of the stellar imf could be the culprit . the number and mass in stars less massive than @xmath175 are quite uncertain as they do not significantly affect observed spectral properties and their contribution to dynamically determined mass estimates is obscured by the uncertainties in the dark matter component . for our analysis",
    "we consistently adopted the chabrier imf ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "let us now suppose that , due to a higher than expected fraction of low - mass stars ( as compared to the chabrier imf ) , the effective mass - to - light ratio values were all to be increased by a factor of @xmath135 ( @xmath176 for the salpeter imf ; values of @xmath177 are also permitted if there were a even stronger turn - over of the stellar number density with decreasing mass as compared to the chabrier imf ) .",
    "this change would alter the theoretical models by reducing the ebl by a factor of about @xmath135 .",
    "the observed values of ebl would of course be unchanged .",
    "thus , increasing the contribution of low - mass stars as compared to the chabrier imf would exacerbate the problem of under - predicting the ebl for all the models .",
    "on the other hand , reducing the contribution of low - mass stars even more so than the chabrier imf would ease the disparity between the predicted and observed ebl .",
    "but then the models would overpredict the present - day luminosity density in various bands and disrupt the rough agreement with the observed values that we found in table  [ table : params ] . therefore no simple adjustment of the stellar imf can be made to remove all discrepancies .",
    "in addition , the parameter @xmath162 was constructed ( equation  [ [ eq : eta ] ] ) in a fashion so as to avoid uncertainties in the stellar imf and it too shows a discrepancy between observed and predicted value .",
    "therefore it seems inevitable that the models of cosmic star formation history that we considered in this paper can not account for a total optical - to - ir ebl of @xmath178 nw m@xmath3 sr@xmath4 .",
    "we would suggest that the direct observation of the ebl in sky may still be contaminated by local emissions .",
    "if future observations would converge to a higher ebl value , as the current direct ebl observations indicate , we would get into a trouble in modeling the history of galaxies : we may have to invoke additional components , such as mini black holes or population iii stars with a top - heavy imf that are not included in the current modeling as discussed in section  [ sec : inconsistent ] .",
    "an interesting feature of our fossil model is that it predicts that the spheroid component formed predominantly at @xmath179 , and the disk component formed mostly at @xmath180 .",
    "the early formation of the spheroidal component is consistent with some recent direct numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this agrees with the observational knowledge known for some time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the early work by @xcite and predecessors .",
    "although the current _ ab initio _ models can not distinguish between these two components , the fossil model provides one example how the total population can be separated into the two population , consistently with observations . as a consequence of the early formation of the spheroidal component ,",
    "our models clearly indicate a relatively constant star formation rate from @xmath181 to @xmath182 .",
    "it will be interesting to see if this prediction is confirmed or refuted by ongoing observational programs .",
    "we also note that the rapid decline of the spheroid formation from @xmath97 to @xmath126 in the fossil model works in favor of having a population of extremely red objects ( eros ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at @xmath126 as found by recent observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of these eros were first regarded as a challenge to the hierarchical cdm models @xcite , but was later shown @xcite that the overall space density of eros could be accounted for in cosmological hydro - simulations . having a high value of sfr density at high - redshift ( @xmath183 ) as our models ( except the sa model ) helps to resolve the issues with the existence of high - redshift eros .",
    "we conclude that the agreement among the three different approaches , as summarized in table  [ table : params ] , is encouraging , and that the fossil model provides a simple effective description of cosmological star formation history with very few free parameters .",
    "furthermore , the general agreement between the tvd , h&s , and the fossil model suggests that the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation based on a cold dark matter model is providing a reasonably accurate picture of cosmological star formation history without a fine tuning of input parameters .",
