    "an important characteristic of two - dimensional turbulent fluid flows is the emergence of coherent structures : in the 80s , numerical simulations @xcite showed that a turbulent flow tends to organize itself spontaneously into large - scale coherent vortices for a wide range of initial conditions and parameters .",
    "laboratory experiments reported similar observations @xcite .",
    "large - scale coherent structures are also ubiquitous in planetary atmospheres and in oceanography . due to the long - lived nature of these structures",
    ", it is very appealing to try to understand the reasons for their appearance and maintenance through a statistical theory .",
    "this endeavour is supported by theoretical arguments : as first noticed by kirchhoff , the equations for a perfect fluid flow can be recast in a hamiltonian form , which makes them _ a priori _ suitable for standard statistical mechanics treatments , as a liouville theorem automatically holds .",
    "the first attempt along these lines was onsager s statistical theory of point vortices @xcite .",
    "one peculiar outcome of onsager s theory is the appearance of negative temperature states at which large - scale vortices form and @xmath0 of the point vortices are canonically conjugate .",
    "this implies that the phase space coincides with the configuration space , so it is finite .",
    "this leads to negative temperature states at high energies . ] .",
    "the point vortex theory was further developed by many authors @xcite and its relations with plasma physics @xcite and astrophysics @xcite was pointed out .",
    "the main problem with onsager s theory is that it describes a finite collection of point vortices and not a continuous vorticity field . in particular , some invariant quantities of perfect fluid flow are singular in the point vortex description , and it is not easy to construct a continuum theory as a limit of the point - vortex theory .",
    "subsequent attempts essentially considered truncations of the equations of motion in the spectral space .",
    "lee @xcite obtained a liouville theorem in the spectral phase space and constructed a statistical theory taking into account only the conservation of energy .",
    "kraichnan built a theory on the basis of the conservation of the quadratic invariants : energy and enstrophy @xcite .",
    "the theory mainly predicts an equilibrium energy spectrum corresponding to an equipartition distribution . this spectrum has been extensively confronted with experiments and numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) but",
    "the discussion remains open @xcite .",
    "more recently , miller @xcite and robert & sommeria @xcite independently developed a theory for the continuous vorticity fields , taking into account all the invariants of motion . due to the infinite number of these invariants ,",
    "the rigorous mathematical justification is more elaborate than previous approaches and relies on convergence theorems for young measures @xcite .",
    "miller @xcite provides two alternative derivations , perhaps more heuristic , the first one being based on phase space - counting ideas similar to boltzmann s classical equilibrium statistical mechanics ( see also lynden - bell @xcite ) , while the second one uses a kac - hubbard - stratonovich transformation .",
    "the mrs theory was checked against laboratory experiments @xcite and numerical studies @xcite in a wide variety of publications @xcite .",
    "one of the main interest of applying statistical mechanical theories to inviscid fluid flows is that it provides a very powerful tool to investigate directly the structure of the final state of the flow , regardless of the temporal evolution that leads to this final state . from a practical point of view ,",
    "such a tool would of course be of great value as it is well - known that turbulence simulations are very greedy in terms of computational resources . in some rare cases",
    ", computations can be carried out analytically and it is even possible to elucidate the final organization of the flow directly from the mean field equations obtained from statistical mechanics . in any case , the interest is also theoretical since equilibrium statistical mechanics of inviscid fluid flows can be seen as a specific example of long - range interacting systems @xcite , whose statistical mechanics is known to yield peculiar behaviors , in phase transitions and ensemble inequivalence @xcite . as an example , statistical mechanics provided valuable insight in the understanding of a von karman experiment , in particular in transitions between different flow regimes @xcite , fluctuation - dissipation relations @xcite and beltramization @xcite .    one particular area where avoiding long numerical turbulence simulations would be highly beneficial is geophysics .",
    "jupiter s great red spot provides a prototypical example of application of statistical mechanics to geophysical fluid dynamics @xcite , in which valuable insight is gained from the statistical theory . even before",
    ", the kraichnan energy - enstrophy theory was extensively used to discuss energy and enstrophy spectra in the atmosphere @xcite and topographic turbulence @xcite . however , only one study @xcite considers the global equilibrium flow in a spherical geometry , with encouraging results , but this study does not investigate the structure of the flow in a systematic way .",
    "statistical mechanics of the continuous vorticity field conserving all the invariants has also been applied to the earth s oceans , focusing either on small - scale parameterizations @xcite or on meso - scale structures @xcite ( and in particular the fofonoff flow @xcite ) .    in this study , we investigate analytically the statistical equilibria of the large - scale general circulation of the earth s atmosphere , modelled by the quasi - geostrophic equations , taking into account the spherical geometry ( with possible bottom topography ) and the full effect of rotation , in the framework of the mrs theory .",
    "more precisely , we show that in the absence of a bottom topography , due to the spherical geometry , the solution to the statistical mechanics problem can be derived in a very simple way .",
    "the result is , however , highly non trivial because , when the conservation of angular momentum is properly accounted for , it leads to a second order phase transition associated with a spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "since all the previous studies used a @xmath1-effect instead of the full coriolis parameter and focused on rectangular bounded regions rather than on the full sphere , this simple solution was not noticed before .",
    "we draw the phase diagrams of the system in both microcanonical and grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "the relations between the two statistical ensembles is described in detail and we present a refined notion of marginal equivalence of ensemble ( see also @xcite ) . in the presence of a bottom topography , we obtain semi - persistent equilibria reminiscent of the structures observed in the atmosphere .",
    "they correspond to saddle points of entropy . strictly speaking , they are unstable since they can be destabilized by certain infinitesimal perturbations belonging to particular subspaces of the dynamical space :",
    "for these saddle points of the entropy surface , there is at least one direction along which the entropy increases while the constraints remain satisfied .",
    "however , it may take a long time before the system spontaneously generates these perturbations .",
    "therefore , these states may persist for a long time before finally being destabilized @xcite . in the atmospheric context , these semi - persistent equilibrium states could account for situations of atmospheric blocking where a large scale structure can form for a few days before finally disappearing .    in section [ genstatmachsection ] , we present the general statistical mechanics of the quasi - geostrophic equations .",
    "in section [ notoporinftysection ] we obtain the structure of the equilibrium mean flow in the particular case of a sphere without bottom topography in the limit of infinite rossby deformation radius , with and without conservation of angular momentum . in section [ generalqg1section ]",
    ", we examine the effect of the bottom topography and of the rossby deformation radius .",
    "section [ discussionsection ] presents a discussion of the obtained results and a comparison with previously published results , while conclusions are presented in section [ conclusionsection ] .",
    "we consider here an incompressible , inviscid , fluid on the two dimensional sphere @xmath2 ( denoted @xmath3 to keep notations simple ) .",
    "the coordinates are @xmath4 where @xmath5 $ ] is the polar angle ( the latitude is thus @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 $ ] the azimuthal angle . in the following , for any quantity @xmath8 , we note @xmath9 its average value over the whole domain : @xmath10 we introduce the eigenvectors of the laplacian @xmath11 on the sphere .",

    ", we shall take the inverse of the earth s rotation rate @xmath21 as the time unit and we set @xmath22 in the radial direction so that the earth mean radius @xmath23 is the length unit . hence all the analytical calculations are carried out on the unit sphere @xmath2 , while we retain the @xmath21 dependance in the calculations to stress the effect of rotation in the formulae , even though for numerical applications , we will always take @xmath24 .",
    "we consider here the simplest model for geophysical flows : the one - layer quasi - geostrophic equations , also called the equivalent barotropic vorticity equations .",
    "we assume that the velocity field @xmath25 satisfies the incompressibility condition @xmath26 , so that we can introduce a stream function @xmath27 such that @xmath28 , and define the potential vorticity as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the topography and @xmath31 the rossby deformation radius @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the potential vorticity is given by the quasi - geostrophic equation @xmath32 in other words , the flow conserves potential vorticity .",
    "together with the fact that the flow is incompressible , this implies the conservation of the integral of any function of potential vorticity @xmath33 , called _ casimir invariants _ ( @xmath34 being an arbitrary function ) . in particular , any moment @xmath35 of the potential vorticity is conserved .",
    "@xmath36 will be called here the _ circulation _ and @xmath37 the",
    "_ potential enstrophy_. the energy , given by @xmath38 is also conserved .",
    "finally , due to the spherical symmetry , one may also consider a supplementary invariant : the integral over the domain of the vertical component of angular momentum @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the zonal component of velocity . in [ solidbodyrotationsappendix ] , we show that , for a solid - body rotation , the dynamical invariants @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not independent : they obey a relation of the form @xmath43 , with @xmath44 . we also show ( [ elappendix ] ) that , for any flow , @xmath45 .    for fluid motion on a rotating sphere , the term @xmath30 includes the coriolis parameter @xmath46 .",
    "following @xcite , the general form we will consider here is @xmath47 with @xmath48 the bottom topography and @xmath49 the average height of the fluid .",
    "the relative vorticity is @xmath50 and the absolute vorticity @xmath51 . in the limit of infinite rossby deformation radius ( @xmath52 ) and no topography ( @xmath53 ) ,",
    "we recover the 2d euler equations . introducing the poisson brackets on the sphere",
    "@xmath54 the quasi - geostrophic equation ( [ qgeq1 ] ) reads @xmath55 it is well known in the case of the euler ( or quasi - geostrophic in a planar domain ) equations that the poisson bracket form implies that the steady states of the equations correspond to @xmath56 with @xmath57 an arbitrary function .",
    "in fact , due to the particular geometry considered here , the form of the steady - states must be slightly refined .",
    "let us consider solutions of the quasi - geostrophic equations of the form @xmath58 . substituting this relation into equation ( [ qpsipoissoneq ] ) , we obtain @xmath59 so that @xmath60 , with @xmath57 an arbitrary function .",
    "this is the general form of the solutions of the quasi - geostrophic equations which are stationary in a frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath61 with respect to the initial reference frame ( which rotates with angular velocity @xmath21 ) . when @xmath62 , we recover the previous @xmath63 relationship .",
    "however , due to the spherical symmetry , there is no reason to select the reference frame @xmath62 _ a priori_.    in the next section , we show that statistical mechanics allows to select a particular function @xmath57 on the grounds that it is the most probable equilibrium state respecting the constraints .",
    "if we were to inject a droplet of dye in a turbulent two - dimensional flow , we would observe a complex mixing where the originally regular patch of dye turns into finer and finer filaments as time goes on .",
    "after a while , the filaments are so intertwined that the dye seems homogeneously distributed over the fluid to a human eye : the coarse - grained dye concentration is homogeneous . in the quasi - geostrophic equations , it is potential vorticity that is mixed by the flow ( equation ( [ qgeq1 ] ) ) .",
    "the crucial difference is that the advected quantity is no longer a passive tracer but plays an active role in the dynamics . due to the conservation constraints associated to the quasi - geostrophic equations",
    ", the potential vorticity mixing will not lead to an homogeneous coarse - grained distribution .",
    "in particular , the energy constaint prevents complete mixing .",
    "we wish to determine what this final coarse - grained state will be , regardless of the details of the fine - grained structure of the potential vorticity field .",
    "analogously to classical statistical mechanics @xcite , after identifying the correct description for microstates ( exact fine - grained vorticity field ) and macrostates ( the coarse - grained vorticity field , mathematically represented as a young measure ) , one selects the macrostate that maximizes the statistical entropy subject to the relevant macroscopic constraints ( conserved quantities ) , as developed by miller and robert @xcite .",
    "the underlying fondamental property is that an overwhelming majority of microstates lie in the vicinity of the equilibrium macrostate .",
    "the implicit separation of scales between microstates and macrostates implies that the contributions of the small - scale fluctuations of vorticity are discarded in the macroscopic quantities ( strictly speaking , this is true for the energy but not for the casimirs : computing the moments of the vorticity distribution using the fine - grained distribution or the coarse - grained distribution yields different results ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the miller - robert - sommeria ( mrs ) theory is a mean - field theory @xcite .",
    "note also that albeit all the dynamically conserved quantities of the equations are imposed as constraints in the statistical mechanics , the topological constraints are not conserved : a connected vorticity domain should remain connected through time , while in the statistical mechanics the only thing that is conserved is the area of this domain .    at the microscopic level ,",
    "the potential vorticity is fully determined by the initial conditions and the evolution equation ( [ qgeq1 ] ) . at the macroscopic level",
    ", we consider the coarse - grained potential vorticity @xmath64 as a random variable with probability distribution @xmath65 : the probability that the potential vorticity has the value @xmath66 with an error @xmath67 at point @xmath68 is @xmath69 .",
    "the potential vorticity distribution @xmath70 characterizes the macroscopic state .",
    "the potential vorticity distribution must satisfy the normalization condition @xmath71 at each point of the domain , and the mean value of the potential vorticity is given by @xmath72 .",
    "we introduce a stream function @xmath27 corresponding to the ensemble - mean potential vorticity through @xmath73 .",
    "the statistical entropy of the probability distribution @xmath65 is @xmath74 = - \\mbox { tr } \\left(\\rho \\ln \\rho \\right)= - \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty } d\\sigma \\int_d d^2{\\bf r } \\rho({\\bf r},\\sigma ) \\ln \\rho({\\bf r},\\sigma).\\ ] ] we are looking for the probability distribution @xmath65 that maximizes the statistical entropy functional @xmath75 $ ] subject to the constraints mentioned in section [ qgeqssection ] : global conservation of energy and casimir functionals .",
    "the conservation of all the casimirs is equivalent to the conservation of the area of each potential vorticity level @xmath76 .",
    "hence the statistical equilibria must satisfy @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the lagrange multipliers associated with the conservation of energy , potential vorticity levels , angular momentum , and normalization .",
    "the resulting potential vorticity probability density is the gibbs state @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 . due to the normalization condition",
    ", the partition function @xmath83 is also given by @xmath84 and the ensemble - mean potential vorticity satisfies the usual relation @xmath85 the right - hand side of this equation is a certain function @xmath57 of the relative stream function @xmath86 .",
    "hence , for given values of the lagrange multipliers @xmath87 and @xmath88 , the statistical entropy maximization procedure selects a functional relationship between potential vorticity and relative stream function at steady - state : @xmath89 .",
    "this describes a flow rotating with angular velocity @xmath90 with respect to the terrestrial frame .",
    "therefore , statistical mechanics selects steady states of the qg equations in a rotating frame .",
    "the resulting mean field equation is simply @xmath91 this is the general mean field equation for equilibrium states of the quasi - geostrophic equations . in the limit @xmath92 ,",
    "one recovers the well - known mean field equation for the euler equation .",
    "note that in the case of only two potential vorticity levels @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the partition function @xmath83 is simply @xmath95 , so that after straightforward computations , we find the @xmath63 relationship @xmath96 with @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 . with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , we recover the @xmath63 relationship @xcite : @xmath102    to determine the statistical equilibrium state , we have to solve the mean field equation ( [ generalstateeq ] ) , relate the lagrange multipliers to the constraints and study the stability of the solutions ( whether they are entropy maxima or saddle points ) .",
    "if several entropy maxima are found for the same parameters ( conserved quantities ) , we must distinguish metastable states ( local entropy maxima ) from fully stable states ( global entropy maxima ) .",
    "in practice , the mean field equation ( [ generalstateeq ] ) is difficult to solve because the function @xmath57 is in general nonlinear due to the conservation of all the moments of the fine - grained potential vorticity . besides , it is generally difficult to relate the lagrange multipliers to the conserved quantitites .",
    "the two levels system of @xcite provides an example of a case where it is possible to write down explicitly the @xmath63 relationship but the meanfield equation ( [ stateeqbouchet ] ) is not analytically solvable without further approximations .",
    "nevertheless , efficient numerical methods do exist , like for instance the algorithm of turkington and whitaker @xcite or the method of relaxation equations @xcite .    to go further with analytical methods ,",
    "a common solution is to linearize the @xmath63 relationship .",
    "several justifications of this procedure can be given , which can be grossly classified in two types of approaches . in the first approach ,",
    "one simply discards the effect of the high - order fine - grained potential vorticity moments ( it would be possible to include them one by one hierarchically ) , while in the second approach , their effect is prescribed through a gaussian _ prior _ distribution for small - scale potential vorticity ( in the general theory , one can specify a non - gaussian prior , which would lead to a nonlinear @xmath63 relationship ) .",
    "* in the limit of strong mixing @xmath103 , the argument of the exponential in the partition function is small and a power expansion of @xmath83 can be carried out .",
    "the rigorous computation is presented in @xcite and yields a linear @xmath104 relationship .",
    "this power series expansion can be done at virtually any order . at first - order , equation ( [ generalstateeq ] )",
    "becomes identical to the mean field equation obtained by minimizing the coarse - grained enstrophy @xmath105 with fixed energy , circulation and angular momentum .",
    "the value of the fine - grained enstrophy @xmath106 is fixed by the initial condition and we always have @xmath107 .",
    "the strong mixing limit thus corresponds to cases where the energy , circulation , angular momentum ( called _ robust invariants _ because they are expressed in terms of the coarse - grained potential vorticity ) and fine - grained enstrophy are the only important invariants and the higher - order moments of the fine - grained enstrophy ( called _ fragile invariants _ ) do not play any role .",
    "this can be seen as a form of justification in the framework of statistical mechanics of inviscid fluids of the early phenomenological minimum enstrophy principle suggested by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite on the basis of the inverse cascade of batchelor @xcite for finite viscosities .",
    "the connection between the inviscid statistical theory and the phenomenological _ selective decay _ approach is discussed at length in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . * for any given energy , one can find a vorticity level distribution @xmath108 such that the function @xmath57 is linear .",
    "this corresponds to a gaussian @xmath109 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath110 is a gaussian with mean value @xmath111 and standard deviation @xmath112 , the analytical computation of the partition function is straightforward @xmath113 and the mean flow satisfies the equation @xmath114 furthermore , if the flow maximizes @xmath115 = - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_d \\bar{q}^2\\ , d^2{\\bf r}$ ] at fixed energy and circulation , then it is granted to be thermodynamically stable in the mrs sense @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the approach of ellis , haven and turkington @xcite , @xmath109 is interpreted as a _ prior distribution _ for the high - order moments of potential vorticity ( fragile constraints ) : arguing that real flows are subjected to forcing and dissipation at small scales , ellis _",
    "@xcite objected that conservation of the fragile constraints ( which depend on the fine - grained field ) is probably irrelevant .",
    "they suggested to treat these constraints canonically by fixing the lagrange multiplier @xmath116 instead of @xmath117 itself .",
    "chavanis @xcite showed that this is equivalent to maximizing a relative entropy @xmath118 with a prescribed _ prior distribution _",
    "@xmath119 for the small - scale potential vorticity .",

    "@xcite take up the argument that the conservation of some casimirs is broken by small - scale forcing and dissipation , but instead of prescribing a prior small - scale vorticity distribution , they suggest that the relevant invariants to keep are determined directly by forcing and dissipation ( which , on average , equilibrate so that the system reaches a quasi - stationary state ) . they show that maximizing the miller - robert - sommeria entropy with fixed energy , circulation , angular momentum and fine - grained enstrophy is equivalent ( for what concerns the macroscopic flow ) to minimizing the coarse - grained enstrophy at fixed energy , circulation and angular momentum .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations around this macroscopic flow are gaussian .",
    "note that one does not necessarily need to justify physically the linear @xmath63 relationship : we may argue that we are just studying a subset of the huge and notoriously difficult to compute class of mrs statistical equilibria .    in the following sections , we shall study the mean equilibrium flow for the quasi - geostrophic equations on the sphere based on these equivalent formulations of the variational problem : we use the generalized entropy @xmath115=-\\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\bar{q}^2 \\rangle = -\\gamma_2^{cg}[\\bar{q}]/(2|d|)$ ] where @xmath123 is the area of the unit sphere will be dropped for convenience . ] , and we consider maxima of this functional with fixed energy @xmath41 , circulation @xmath124 and angular momentum @xmath42 . hence , our study is restricted to the case of a linear @xmath63 relationship .",

    "clearly , the critical points of the microcanonical and grand - canonical variational problems are the same , due to the lagrange multiplier theorem .",
    "however the nature of these critical points ( maximum , minimum , saddle point ) can differ . nevertheless , it is straightforward to convince oneself that a maximum of the relaxed variational problem is also a maximum of the constrained variational problem ( grand - canonical stability implies microcanonical stability ) and that a saddle point of the constrained variational problem is necessarily a saddle point of the relaxed variational problem ( microcanonical instability implies grand - canonical instability ) .",
    "more detailed relationships between the constrained and relaxed variational problems can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is thus possible that a maximum in the constrained variational problem ( that is an equilibrium state in the microcanonical ensemble ) may not be reached in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "such a situation happens when no grand - canonical equilibrium has the prescribed energy , circulation , and angular momentum if relevant . in this case",
    ", we speak of _ ensemble inequivalence_. more precisely , we have just described ensemble inequivalence at the _ macrostate level _ @xcite .",
    "another characterization of ensemble inequivalence , referred to as ensemble inequivalence at the _ thermodynamic level _ , is linked to the concavity of the entropy @xmath128 @xcite . indeed , the functions @xmath128 and @xmath131 are linked by legendre - fenchel transformations . using convex analysis @xcite , it can be proved that the transformation is invertible only when @xmath128 is a concave function .",
    "a particular indicator of ensemble inequivalence is the microcanonical specific heat .",

    ", the microcanonical ensemble is the natural one to treat problems where the system is large enough to be considered isolated , as in astrophysics or geophysical flows .",
    "yet , it is always more convenient mathematically to deal with a relaxed variational problem than directly with the constrained variational problem . for this reason ,",
    "it is customary to consider canonical or grand - canonical ensembles even in these cases .",
    "meanwhile , one must keep in mind that the physical interpretation of the canonical or grand - canonical ensemble may not be straightforward . in our case , it is not easy to see what physical object would play the role of a reservoir of energy , circulation or angular momentum . in other words , it is not clear how the lagrange multipliers @xmath132 and @xmath133 are fixed , and which physical quantity they represent . strictly speaking , the canonical and grand - canonical ensembles are physically relevant only when they are equivalent with the microcanonical ensemble ( or when",
    "there is a good physical reason to be otherwise ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the microcanonical ensemble is always physically relevant .",
    "_ remark _ : we have justified the variational principles ( [ vw1])-([vw4 ] ) as conditions of thermodynamical stability .",
    "we note that the very same variational principles can also be interpreted as sufficient conditions of nonlinear dynamical stability with respect to the qg equations @xcite .",

    "partial ensemble equivalence is also seen at the thermodynamic level : geometrically , the entropy @xmath366 is a plane . in particular , it is a concave function , but only marginally so ; it is also a convex function .",
    "the statistical temperature @xmath367 is constant and equal to @xmath368 , except possibly when @xmath43 . besides , both second partial derivatives @xmath369 and @xmath370 vanish .    here , it is possible to measure how severe the partial ensemble equivalence is .",
    "we have already described precisely the relationships between the different sets of equilibrium states obtained for various values of the parameters in both statistical ensembles .",
    "now , we recall that in the stability analysis , we mentioned that in the grand - canonical ensemble , there is metastability in a three - dimensional vector space , while it reduces to a one - dimensional manifold in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "in other words , there are three different modes ( goldstone modes ) which can move the system from one metastable state to another in the grand - canonical ensemble , while there is only one such goldstone mode in the microcanonical ensemble . if we considered any mixed ensemble , with one constraint treated microcanonically and the other canonically , we would have two goldstone modes .",
    "thus , the number of goldstone modes in each ensemble provides a refined characterization of ensemble equivalence properties , as compared to simply calling it  partial \" .",
    "the phase transition observed here is made possible by the degeneracy of the first eigenspace of the laplacian on the sphere , which allows for non - trivial energy condensation .",
    "although all the energy condenses in the first mode , we have two distinct equilibrium flow structures .",
    "the ensemble equivalence properties also owe to the particular geometry .",
    "previous studies all assumed that the first eigenvalue of the laplacian is non - degenerate @xcite . when this is not the case , it is straightforward to see that ensemble inequivalence results such as those obtained in @xcite may collapse .    nonetheless , it is not clear how generic partial equivalence of statistical ensemble is .",
    "for instance , considering small non - linearities in the @xmath63 relationship may change the nature of the phase transition and the ensemble equivalence properties . in the case of the energy - enstrophy ensemble on a rectangular domain with fixed boundary conditions ,",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the phase transition may remain second order or turn into a first - order phase transition depending on the sign of the first non - linear coefficient in the @xmath63 relationship .",
    "this analysis is likely to remain valid in the case we are considering here .",
    "in the previous section , we have seen that in the absence of a bottom topography , the statistical mechanics of the quasi - geostrophic equations in spherical geometry can be solved in a very simple manner due to the fact that the coriolis parameter is an eigenvector of the laplacian on the sphere .",
    "adding an angular momentum conservation constraint does not alter this derivation since it simply adds another contribution proportional to the same eigenvector of the laplacian to the mean field equation . in this section ,",
    "we treat the general case , with a finite rossby deformation radius as well as an arbitrary topography .",
    "the critical points of the variational problem @xmath127   | e[q]=e , \\gamma[q]=\\gamma , l[q]=l \\},\\ ] ] given by @xmath371 , satisfy the linear @xmath63 relationship @xmath372 .",
    "now , @xmath139 is determined by averaging over the whole domain @xmath373 replacing @xmath64 with @xmath374 , the mean field equation becomes @xmath375 where @xmath376 plays the role of the inverse temperature @xmath1 in the case of a finite rossby deformation radius .",
    "as before , we are free to make the gauge choice @xmath377 as it does not affect the structure of the flow .",
    "therefore , the mean field equation can be rewritten @xmath378 following @xcite , the general solution can be written @xmath379 where @xmath380 and @xmath381 satisfy @xmath382    let us assume for the moment that @xmath383 .",
    "we have @xmath384 and @xmath385 the general solution reads @xmath386 or in terms of the potential vorticity @xmath387 defining @xmath388 , the stream function takes the compact form @xmath389 the energy is given by the relation @xmath390 which gives , after replacing with equations ( [ mow ] ) and ( [ psihelmoltzsol ] ) , and simplifying : @xmath391 replacing @xmath380 with equation ( [ phi2series ] ) - or directly substituting equation ( [ psigeneral ] ) in equation ( [ edefeqn ] ) - we obtain @xmath41 as the sum of a series : @xmath392 similarly , the angular momentum and entropy can be expressed as @xmath393 where the sum is on all indices @xmath394 except @xmath395 and @xmath396 .",
    "this is the general solution of the problem . for a given topography ,",
    "these equations of state determine the lagrange multipliers @xmath1 and @xmath133 as a function of the energy @xmath41 and angular momentum @xmath42 . equation ( [ angmomgeneraleqn ] ) is easily inverted to yield @xmath397 similarly , the relation between the lagrange multiplier @xmath139 and the circulation @xmath124 is easily obtained : @xmath398 from equations ( [ energymideqn ] ) and ( [ angmomgeneraleqn ] ) , we introduce the control parameter @xmath399 in terms of which we obtain @xmath400 the right hand - side is only a function of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in practice , for a given set of control parameters @xmath401 , solving equation ( [ ectrlfunbeta ] ) for @xmath1 together with equations ( [ muofl ] ) and ( [ alphaofgammaeq ] ) yields the value of the lagrange multipliers @xmath402 .",
    "if we do not take into account the conservation of angular momentum ( @xmath252 ) , equations ( [ energymideqn ] ) and ( [ angmomgeneraleqn ] ) reduce to @xmath403 since @xmath404 , equation ( [ emuzeroeq ] ) can also be written @xmath405 in the case @xmath52 , this expression reduces to @xmath406 as found in @xcite .      in the case",
    "where @xmath407 , if @xmath408 with @xmath409 , then , strictly speaking , we must have @xmath410 for all @xmath219 . in practice ,",
    "if the topography has a non - vanishing mode of order @xmath411 , which is the generic case , then as @xmath412 , the corresponding mode becomes overwhelmingly dominant in the stream function : @xmath413 ( if there are several possible values of @xmath414 , then the stream function will be proportional to the appropriate linear combination of these modes ) .",
    "the corresponding divergence for the energy and entropy are like @xmath415 .",
    "if , on the contrary , the topography has no contribution proportional to any spherical harmonic of order @xmath416 , then the stream function belongs to the @xmath417 dimensional solution space @xmath418 where @xmath419 are arbitrary coefficients .",
    "the energy and entropy are given by @xmath420 where it is assumed that in @xmath421 and @xmath422 the term @xmath423 is discarded in the sum .",
    "as in section [ mixedlflowsec ] , the case @xmath424 is only possible when @xmath425 .",
    "then , the equilibrium flow is a superposition between the dipolar flow of section [ mixedlflowsec ] and the general continuum solution described in the previous section .",
    "after some easy algebra , the second order variations of the grand - potential functional @xmath309=s[q]-\\beta e[q ] - \\alpha \\gamma[q ] - \\mu l[q]$ ] are proved to be equal to @xmath426 as in section [ stabilityegsection ] , we see that if @xmath427 , the equilibrium flow is a local maximum of the entropy functional .    if there exist a couple @xmath394 such that @xmath428 , then perturbations proportional to @xmath12 destabilize the basic flow for @xmath429 while preserving the constraints at first order .",
    "but , in general , no coefficient vanishes in the spherical harmonic expansion and it is not sufficient to repeat as it stands the reasoning of section [ stabilityegsection ] with perturbations proportional to eigenvectors of the laplacian since they would not conserve the energy anymore .",
    "however , the orthogonal set of the basic flow remains an hyperplane and one may construct many perturbations not proportional to eigenvectors of the laplacian . to keep the computation of the second order variations of the free energy with respect to the perturbation simple",
    ", we shall look for a destabilizing perturbation in a two - dimensional subspace of this hyperplane .",
    "let us consider the perturbations spanned by two eigenvectors of the laplacian : @xmath430 .",
    "clearly the corresponding variation of the potential vorticity is @xmath431 .",
    "for any non - zero @xmath432 , this perturbation conserves the circulation .",
    "the variation of the energy is found to be @xmath433 to ensure that the perturbation conserves the energy , we choose @xmath434 such that @xmath435 is orthogonal to the basic flow : @xmath436 it remains to see if the main flow is stable or not against this perturbation . to that purpose",
    "we need to compute @xmath321 .",
    "we find that @xmath437 and with the particular choice ( [ epsilon2eq ] ) for @xmath434 , we obtain the criterion : @xmath438 with @xmath439 from the computation of its derivative , we can see that @xmath152 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath440 . let us define @xmath441 then , @xmath152 vanishes for @xmath442 .",
    "the instability condition thus reads @xmath443 clearly , @xmath444 lies in between @xmath445 and @xmath446 , and for @xmath447 , @xmath448 .",
    "in particular the choice @xmath449 ( with @xmath450 ) proves that all the solutions with @xmath451 are saddle points .",
    "we now turn to the description of the influence of an arbitrary topography and a finite rossby deformation radius on the structure of the statistical equilibria . as the effect of angular momentum",
    "was already studied thoroughly in section [ eglsection ] , we shall assume in the sequel that @xmath252 .",
    "the interpretation of relation ( [ psigeneral ] ) linking the topography ( including the coriolis effect ) and the equilibrium streamfunction is relatively simple .",
    "the general structure of the topography is reproduced in the equilibrium flow , with a statistical temperature - dependent weighing of each mode .",
    "in particular , the modes of the topography with eigenvalues close to the statistical temperature will prevail in the final flow .",
    "in general , for a given statistical temperature , the small - scale details of the topography ( i.e. high - order modes ) will not affect the general structure of the equilibrium flow : their amplitude in the equilibrium streamfunction decreases relatively quickly , as @xmath452 where @xmath230 is the order of the ( degenerate ) mode .        for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "we consider a specific example with the earth s topography in a t16 spectral truncation ( see figure [ earthtopofig ] ) .",

    "the effect of the finite rossby deformation radius is mainly seen for low values of the energy.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "let us summarize the results obtained in the previous sections .",
    "the statistical equilibrium states ( in the sense as those corresponding to a linear @xmath63 relationship ) of the quasi - geostrophic equations with conservation of energy and circulation on a rotating sphere are as follows :    * for a smooth ( without bottom topography ) sphere without taking into account the conservation of the vertical component of the angular momentum : the only stable state is a counter - rotating solid - body rotation .",
    "there is always an unstable equilibrium state which is a co - rotating solid - body rotation .",
    "depending on the energy , one may also have unstable degenerate eigenmodes ( since the coefficients are undetermined , these can be any combination of the corresponding spherical harmonics ) , which are saddle points of the entropy . * for a smooth sphere taking into account conservation of the vertical component of the angular momentum , there are two possibilities : if the energy and angular momentum values satisfy the relation @xmath43 , we have a solid - body rotation with angular velocity @xmath344 .",
    "in particular , both counter - rotating and co - rotating rotations are possible as stable equilibria .",
    "otherwise , the statistical equilibrium is a dipole : in this case , we observe a spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with a second order phase transition .",
    "again there are possibilities of unstable saddle points states as in the previous case .",
    "* for a sphere with a bottom topography , the equilibrium states are unchanged , but there are extra saddle points states featuring higher - order spherical harmonics ( @xmath222 ) that are more constrained ( due to the topography ) than when they appear as degenerate solutions of the helmholtz mean - field equation . at high energies ,",
    "the topography has a negligible effect , while it becomes important at low energies .",
    "one of the original motivations of the theories of statistical mechanics for two - dimensional turbulent flows @xcite was to account for the observed tendency for the flow to organize into coherent structures , such as monopoles , dipoles , tripoles , quadrupoles , etc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical simulations suggesting these large - scale structures , as well as the theoretical attempts to obtain them as statistical equilibria , focus on planar flow cases with either fixed or periodic boundary conditions , and flows in a @xmath1-channel @xcite . in the present study ,",
    "we find that the combined effect of rotation and spherical geometry partially annihilates these coherent structures : in the absence of a bottom topography , the equilibrium flow is purely zonal .",
    "this prediction from the theory is confirmed by early results obtained in numerical simulations of 2d turbulent flows on a sphere @xcite . however ,",
    "if we impose an additional constraint of angular momentum conservation , we recover a dipolar equilibrium state ( for some values of the external parameters ) .",
    "interestingly , in this case the statistical mechanics presents a spontaneous symmetry - breaking feature : we obtain a set of equilibrium states with a phase factor as a free parameter . for each particular equilibrium state ,",
    "the axial symmetry is broken but the action of rotations around the vertical axis leaves the set of equilibrium states globally invariant .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking appears due to the presence of a second order phase transition , which occurs in both the microcanonical and the grand - canonical ensembles .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the thermodynamical properties of the system are quite unusual @xcite .",
    "the microcanonical and grand - canonical ensembles are equivalent , but only marginally so : the entropy functional is a plane and , as such , it is concave but it is also convex",
    ". the statistical temperature does not depend on the energy in the dipole phase , and can be anything greater than @xmath368 in the solid - body rotation phase .",
    "besides , the specific heats @xmath487 and @xmath488 both vanish .",
    "in direct simulations on a non - rotating sphere , conservation of all the components of angular momentum leads to the formation of coherent structures , while in the presence of rotation , when only one component of the angular momentum is conserved , zonal structures emerge .",
    "in fact , carrying out the statistical mechanics procedure developed in this study with all the components of the angular momentum conserved ( and thus vanishing rotation ) indeed yields coherent structures similar to those observed in numerical simulations .",
    "the two extra conserved quantities add terms proportional to @xmath489 and @xmath490 , which lead to a flow similar to the dipole obtained in section [ mixedlflowsec ] , except that the phase is now fixed by the angular momentum constraint . besides , this flow perdures for external parameters varying in a wide range , whereas it only occurs for @xmath200 and @xmath304 in section [ mixedlflowsec ] .    on the rotating sphere , as summarized above , the stable equilibrium flow does not present complex vortices , except in one case if we take into account conservation of angular momentum .",
    "but as shown on figure [ psitopoebspectrum ] in the presence of a bottom topography , many coherent structures can be realized as unstable saddle points states with a statistical temperature close to a laplacian eigenvalue .",
    "those corresponding to low - order eigenvalues ( like the quadrupole ) are likely to be only weakly unstable , since only low - order perturbations can destabilize them",
    ". they could account for atmospheric blocking where a vortex persists for a few days and is finally destabilized and disappears .    finally ,",
    "also note that even in the absence of a bottom topography and without conservation of angular momentum , coherent vortices can be obtained as degenerate modes ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the resulting stream function then resembles the examples in figure [ psitopoebspectrum ] , except that the coefficients are not determined in any way .",
    "thus , virtually any combination of the eigenvectors for this eigenvalue is an acceptable equilibrium stream function .",
    "however , as pointed out before , these states are not stable , even though they can be long - lived , especially low - order modes .",
    "it would be of great interest to compute the statistical equilibrium obtained from the theory for realistic values of the constraints ( kinetic energy , angular momentum ) and to compare it to observations and predictions from dynamical models .",
    "in the case of the earth , this was done by verkley and lynch @xcite in the framework of the kraichan energy - enstrophy theory for a spectrally truncated model , with partial agreement .",
    "we shall report elsewhere the results obtained by doing so with the theory developed here .",
    "note that @xcite considers some simple representation of forcing and dissipation .",
    "although the results obtained are very encouraging , it is difficult to justify rigorously the inclusion of forcing and dissipation , as the liouville theorem does not automatically hold in this case .",
    "however , in real flows , forcing and dissipation do not equilibrate locally , and they play an important role in the theory of geophysical fluids . nevertheless , there are some known cases where quasi - stationnary states reached by a forced - dissipated system are well approximated by some equilibrium states of a system with no forcing and no dissipation .",
    "an important example is the von karman flow @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that , at least in some cases , the non - equilibrium attractors may remain in the vicinity of some equilibrium states .",
    "however , the general question of the relevance of equilibrium approaches to non - equilibrium problems is far from being understood .",
    "in this paper , we have applied the miller - robert - sommeria statistical theory for perfect inviscid fluids to the general circulation on a rotating sphere .",
    "the large - scale circulation is modelled by a one - layer ( barotropic ) quasi - geostrophic flow and the potential vorticity plays the role of the vorticity in the mrs theory . if we only consider the conservation of the fine - grained enstrophy among the infinite class of casimirs , the maximization of the mrs entropy at fixed energy , circulation , angular momentum and fine - grained enstrophy is equivalent , for what concerns the mean field , to the minimization of the coarse - grained enstrophy at fixed energy , circulation and angular momentum @xcite .",
    "this leads to a linear @xmath63 relationship .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations around the mean field state are gaussian .",
    "we have shown that the mean field equation can be solved analytically in a very simple way due to the geometry of the domain and the fact that the coriolis parameter is an eigenvector of the laplacian on the sphere . ignoring the conservation of angular momentum",
    ", we have found that the stable statistical equilibrium flow is a counter - rotating solid - body rotation .",
    "taking the conservation of angular momentum into account , we have obtained two qualitatively different equilibrium flows : solid - body rotation ( reminiscent of the previous case ) or dipole . in the latter case ,",
    "the axial symmetry is spontaneously broken and the system displays a second order phase transition . finally , we have shown that the equilibrium quasi - geostrophic flow on a sphere with arbitrary bottom topography has the same background structure with topography - induced modes superimposed .",
    "in particular , unstable saddle points modes with multipole vortex structures appear , even though they were already possible as degenerate modes in the absence of a bottom topography .",
    "albeit obtained with a relatively simple model , these results suggest that statistical mechanics constitutes a nice and efficient framework for theoretical studies of large - scale planetary circulation .",
    "they also provide a strong incentive to generalize the statistical mechanical methods to more realistic models of the atmosphere and oceans .",
    "there is a specific type of flow which is of central importance in this study : solid - body rotations .",
    "these correspond to the case when all the fluid revolves around the axis of rotation of the sphere , exactly as if it were a solid . under these conditions ,",
    "the stream function reads @xmath491 where @xmath281 is the angular velocity of the solid - body rotation .",
    "clearly for this specific flow , all the dynamical invariants are not independent , as all the dynamical quantities depend only on @xmath281 .",
    "in fact , straightforward computations lead to @xmath492 we thus introduce the function @xmath44 which gives the energy of a solid - body rotation with angular momentum @xmath42 . in [ elappendix ] , we show that the energy of any flow on the sphere is always greater than the energy of a solid - body rotation with the same angular momentum . alternatively , we can define the functions @xmath493 and @xmath494 . the angular momentum of a solid - body rotation in the positive direction with energy @xmath41 is @xmath355 , while @xmath354 is the angular momentum of a solid - body rotation in the negative direction with energy @xmath41 . clearly , specifying the energy of the solid - body rotation is not enough , one needs to know in addition the direction of rotation , hence the two functions @xmath495 and @xmath496 .",
    "note that the relation between the energy , the angular momentum , and the enstrophy which arises as the thermodynamic equilibrium entropy in the text is already fixed by the dynamical constraints in the case of a solid - body rotation : @xmath497 .",
    "for quasi - geostrophic flows on a rotating sphere , the kinetic energy reads @xmath498 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the components of the velocity .",
    "the vertical component of the angular momentum is @xmath499 .",
    "the cauchy - schwarz inequality immediately yields @xmath500 and consequently , @xmath501 therefore , we always have @xmath45 .",
    "the lower bound for the energy is reached for a solid - body rotation ( see [ solidbodyrotationsappendix ] ) .",
    "we can also say that , for a given energy @xmath41 , the angular momentum @xmath42 must satisfy @xmath502 .",
    "another derivation of this inequality sheds more light on its physical interpretation . for a given value of the angular momentum @xmath42 ,",
    "it is always possible to find a reference frame in which @xmath503 .",
    "indeed , in a reference frame @xmath504 rotating with angular velocity @xmath505 relative to the earth s rotation , straightforward computations give @xmath506 where @xmath507 is the energy in @xmath504 .",
    "clearly , the value of @xmath505 such that @xmath503 is @xmath508 , and it is also the value for which @xmath507 is a minimum .",
    "thus @xmath509 so that we again obtain @xmath45 .",
    "finally , the shortest way to this inequality is perhaps to decompose the fields on spherical harmonics so that @xmath510 and @xmath511 clearly , @xmath512 and @xmath513 so that , again , @xmath45 .",
    "this proof makes it evident that the inequality only means that the energy is always at least the energy contained in the solid - body rotation mode , which is directly fixed by the angular momentum .    for fixed enstrophy",
    ", the classical fjortoft argument @xcite also gives an upper bound on the energy : @xmath514 so that @xmath515 .",
    "finally , @xmath516 where all the inequalities become equalities in the case of a solid - body rotation .",
