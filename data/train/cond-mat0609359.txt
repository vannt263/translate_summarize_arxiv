    "high - temperature superconducting cuprates are doped mott insulators with strongly correlated electronic ground states manifested in forms of different competing orders ( co ) besides superconductivity ( sc )  @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the presence of coexisting sc and co in the ground state has a number of important implications : 1 ) the occurrence of quantum criticality becomes a natural consequence of competing phases in the ground state  @xcite ; 2 ) significant quantum fluctuations are expected as the result of proximity to quantum criticality  @xcite ; 3 ) the low - energy excitations of coexisting sc and co differ from conventional bogoliubov quasiparticles of pure sc because of redistribution of the spectral weight between sc and co  @xcite ; 4 ) the presence of competing orders and strong quantum fluctuations gives rise to weakened superconducting stiffness and extreme type - ii nature in the cuprates  @xcite ; 5 ) the relevant competing orders can vary in different cuprates , giving rise to non - universal physical properties  @xcite ; 6 ) the existence of competing orders and accompanied unconventional low - energy excitations are likely relevant to the occurrence of pseudogap phenomena  @xcite .",
    "we further note that empirically the pseudogap phenomena generally refer to two different energy scales ; the lower energy scale is correlated with the nernst effect  @xcite and the suppressed quasiparticle density of states observed above @xmath0 , and is only found in hole - type cuprates ; whereas the higher energy scale is present in both electron- and hole - type cuprates according to optical  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite experiments .",
    "as discussed in our recent work  @xcite and further elaborated below in this paper , the lower - energy pseudogap may be associated with the competing order , whereas the higher - energy pseudogap seems to be of magnetic origin .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the effect of competing orders and quantum phase fluctuations on the quasiparticle spectral function and density of states ( dos ) by incorporating both sc and co in the bare green s function and quantum phase fluctuations in the proper self - energy .",
    "using realistic bandstructures and physical parameters in our calculations and comparing the resulting spectra with experimental data on both hole- and electron - type cuprates , we find favorable comparison of the concept of coexisting co and sc with a wide range of experimental phenomena  @xcite , including the occurrence of excess subgap quasiparticle density of states ( dos )  @xcite , spatial modulations in the low - temperature quasiparticle spectra that are unaccounted for by bogoliubov quasiparticles alone  @xcite , `` dichotomy '' in the momentum - dependent quasiparticle spectral function from arpes  @xcite , and the presence ( absence ) of the low - energy pseudogap  @xcite in the hole ( electron)-type cuprates above the sc transition .",
    "we also conjecture that the high - energy pseudogap observed in optical  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite experiments on the cuprates may be associated with dynamic spin fluctuations , which can be stabilized by an external field . in this context , we present experimental evidence for current - induced pseudogap in electron - type cuprates  @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose a unified phase diagram for all cuprates based on the findings of competing orders and two pseudogap energy scales .",
    "in order to consider the effect of coexisting co and sc on the low - energy excitations consistently , we begin by incorporating both co and sc in the mean - field hamiltonian , and then include the quantum phase fluctuations associated with the co and sc phases in the proper self - energy to solve the dyson s equation self - consistently for the full green s function at @xmath1 so as to obtain the quasiparticle spectral density function @xmath2 and the density of states @xmath3 , as detailed in ref .  @xcite . for electron - type cuprates , we consider the case of coexisting @xmath4-wave sc and charge - density waves ( cdw )  @xcite , whereas for hole - type cuprates , we assume coexisting @xmath5-wave sc and disorder - pinned spin - density waves ( sdw )  @xcite .",
    "we also examine the possibility of @xmath5-density waves ( ddw )  @xcite being the relevant co in @xmath5-wave sc , and in all cases , we employ the realistic bandstructures and fermi levels for given cuprates under consideration . specifically , we consider the bare green s function @xmath6 associated with the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the bcs - like superconducting hamiltonian for a given pairing potential @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being independent of @xmath11 in the case of @xmath4-wave pairing and @xmath12 for @xmath13-wave pairing . here",
    "@xmath14 is the lattice constant of the two - dimensional cuo@xmath15 layer , @xmath16 is the mean - field co hamiltonian with the co energy scale given by @xmath17 and the wave - vector of the co ( among cdw , sdw and ddw ) given by @xmath18  @xcite . in the zero - temperature zero - field limit ,",
    "the quantum phase fluctuations are dominated by the longitudinal phase fluctuations , which can be approximated by the one - loop velocity - velocity correlation in the proper self - energy @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "thus , the full green s function @xmath20 is determined self - consistently through the dyson s equation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the energy renormalized by the phase fluctuations .",
    "equation ( 2 ) is solved self - consistently  @xcite by first choosing an energy @xmath23 , going over the @xmath11-values in the brillouin zone by summing over a finite phase space in @xmath24 near each @xmath11 , and then finding the corresponding @xmath25 , @xmath22 and @xmath26 until the solution to the full green s function @xmath27 converges using iteration method  @xcite .",
    "the converged green s function yields the spectral density function @xmath28 / \\pi$ ] and the dos @xmath29 .",
    "we also confirm the conservation of spectral weight throughout the self - consistent calculations .    using the aforementioned approach",
    ", we find that many important features in the quasiparticle dos of both the hole- and electron - type cuprates of varying doping levels can be well accounted for by a set of parameters @xmath30 , provided that the co specified couples well to the bogoliubov quasiparticles of the cuprates near the fermi level , and @xmath31 denotes the magnitude of the quantum phase fluctuations specified in ref .",
    "@xcite . as exemplified in fig .  1",
    ", we compare the quasiparticle tunneling spectra of three different cuprates of varying doping levels with theoretically calculated quasiparticle dos for ( a ) @xmath32 ( bi-2212 )  @xcite , ( b ) @xmath33 ( y-123 )  @xcite , and ( c ) optimally doped @xmath34 ( la-112 )  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding sc gap ( @xmath35 ) and co energy ( @xmath17 ) as a function of the doping level are determined from the fitting and shown in fig .",
    "in contrast to the common empirical practice that denotes the peak - to - peak or hump - to - hump energy differences as twice of the nominal sc gap values without considering co , we find that our theoretical fitting to the quasiparticle dos not only captures the primary features of the tunneling spectra but also yields doping dependent @xmath35 that better follows the doping dependence of @xmath0 , whereas the doping dependence of @xmath17 increases with decreasing doping level .",
    "another important finding of our calculations is to provide a natural explanation for the presence and the absence of low - energy pseudogap in hole - type and electron - type cuprate superconductors , respectively .",
    "that is , generally if @xmath36 , the quasiparticle spectra exhibit two sets of peaks at energies @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "the peaks at @xmath40 vanish at @xmath0 while those associated with @xmath41 remain finite at @xmath42 above @xmath0 and become much broadened due to thermal fluctuations . thus , these broadened features at @xmath42 above @xmath0 can be referred to as the lower - energy pseudogap .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath43 and under finite quantum fluctuations , the quasiparticle spectra only exhibit one set of peaks at energies @xmath44 as exemplified in fig .",
    "1(c ) , and no discernible low - energy pseudogap can be observed above @xmath0 .",
    "we therefore conclude that in under- and optimally doped hole - type cuprates , the condition @xmath36 generally holds , whereas in electron - type cuprates , we generally find @xmath43 .",
    "the disparity in the strength of the competing energy scales may be related to the much better electronic coupling with the longitudinal optical phonons  @xcite for the hole - type electronic configuration along the cu - o bonding direction in the cuo@xmath15 plane , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in addition to accounting for the primary features of doping dependent quasiparticle tunneling spectra , the notion of coexisting co and sc can also explain the spatially varying local density of states ( ldos ) and the corresponding fourier transformation of the ldos ( ft - ldos ) in bi-2212  @xcite . as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "2(a ) , the spatially varying ldos can be simulated by designating spatially varying parameters @xmath45 so that the corresponding ldos @xmath46 for a given bulk doping level can reproduce the empirical finding .",
    "specifically , we note that overall @xmath35 does not vary much within each sample , as manifested in fig .",
    "1(d ) , while the magnitude of @xmath17 changes more significantly with the doping level and in space , particularly for the underdoped cuprates .",
    "we may approximately divide the spectral characteristics of bi-2212 into two types of regions : the `` a''-type region with larger @xmath17 accompanied by stronger fluctuations ( large @xmath31 ) , and the `` b''-type region with smaller @xmath17 accompanied by small @xmath31 . on the other hand , @xmath35 remains relatively homogeneous throughout a and b regions for a sample of a nominal doping level .",
    "the total area of the b - type region appears to increases with increasing doping level at the cost of the a - type region . therefore , the appearance of spectral inhomogeneity may be largely attribute to variations in @xmath17 and @xmath31 , as exemplified in fig .",
    "2(b ) for a special case showing spectral variations due to increasing @xmath31 while keeping @xmath35 and @xmath17 fixed .",
    "we further note that the variations in @xmath17 and @xmath31 can effectively result in scattering of quasiparticles .",
    "consequently , we expect the ft - ldos of such quasiparticle spectra in the first brillouin zone to reveal not only excess contributions associated with the co at the wave - vector @xmath18  @xcite but also quasiparticle interference effects  @xcite as the result of spatial inhomogeneity in @xmath17 and @xmath31 .",
    "we further emphasize that the spectral inhomogeneity is not the result of large variations in @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 in bi-2212 system apparently exhibit much stronger spatial variations than that in other cuprates such as y-123 and la-112 , probably due to the stronger two dimensionality in bi-2212 .",
    "while we have demonstrated that cdw and sdw are relevant co in accounting for the unconventional low - energy excitations and the lower - energy pseudogap phenomena , the importance of considering the realistic bandstructures and fermi level in determining whether a co is relevant to cuprate superconductivity can not be over - emphasized .",
    "for instance , in our consideration of either cdw or sdw as the coexisting co with sc , although the wave - vector @xmath18 of the density waves need not be commensurate with @xmath47 , maximum effect of co on the low - energy excitations only occurs when @xmath48 and @xmath49 are comparable to the fermi momentum @xmath50 for @xmath18 along either ( 0,@xmath51 ) or ( @xmath51,0 ) direction .",
    "specifically , maximum effect of co occurs when @xmath52 for @xmath18 along ( 0,@xmath51 ) and @xmath53 for @xmath18 along ( @xmath51,0 ) .",
    "if we relax the condition for @xmath18 such that @xmath49 deviates substantially from @xmath50 , the effect of co becomes much weakened . as exemplified in fig .  3",
    ", we compare the effective order parameter @xmath54 in the first quadrant of the brillouin zone of @xmath4-wave sc with coexisting cdw ( first row ) and @xmath13-wave sc with coexisting sdw ( second row ) . for the co wave - vector @xmath18 varying from @xmath55 ( left panels ) , @xmath56 ( middle panels ) , to @xmath57 ( right panels ) , we find the strongest co - induced dichotomy ( _ i.e. _ , anisotropic momentum dependence of @xmath54 ) for @xmath56 , implying the maximum effect of the co on the ground state and the low - energy excitations of the cuprates if the co wave - vector is correlated with the fermi momentum .        in this context",
    ", we examine the effect of ddw on cuprate superconductivity and find that the ddw order parameter does not couple well with the doped cuprates .",
    "specifically , its effect is only significant for the nearly nested fermi surface ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) , which corresponds to a nearly half - filling ( and thus insulating ) condition with bandstructures not representative of the cuprates . on the other hand ,",
    "the contribution of ddw to quasiparticle tunneling spectra becomes essentially uncorrelated with experimental observation if we consider the fermi surface of a realistic cuprate with a doping level deviating from half - filling , as shown in fig .",
    "thus far with the notion of coexisting co and sc and quantum fluctuations , we have successfully accounted for the experimental findings of apparent pseudogap phenomena in arpes and stm of hole - type cuprate superconductors by the condition @xmath36 and for the absence of such phenomena in electron - type by the condition @xmath58 .",
    "this pseudogap at a lower energy scale ( _ i.e. _ , on the order of @xmath35 ) is well correlated with the anomalous nernst effect  @xcite and has only been found in hole - type cuprates .",
    "in contrast , the higher - energy pseudogap ( on the order of the neel temperature ) observed in optical  @xcite and neutron scattering  @xcite experiments on both electron- and hole - type cuprates may have its physical origin primarily in magnetism . in the case of bi-2212 system ,",
    "the higher - energy pseudogap seems correlated with the so - called `` dip - hump '' features in the quasiparticle tunneling spectra , whose characteristic energies appear to be related to the energies of spin fluctuations found in raman spectroscopy and neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "if the higher - energy pseudogap is indeed of magnetic origin and is dynamic in nature , one would expect that the presence of an external field can stabilize such a dynamic phase , leading to interesting experimental consequences .",
    "a piece of suggestive evidence associated with this conjecture has been recently observed in our tunneling spectroscopic studies of the electron - type la-112 system . as shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "5(a ) , for sufficiently small tunneling currents the quasiparticle spectrum of optimally doped la-112 exhibits no pseudogap above @xmath0  @xcite , which is as expected because our fitting to the data reveals @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , if we increase the tunneling currents beyond a critical value ( @xmath59 na ) that corresponds to a local magnetic field on the order of a few tens of tesla , we find that the original sharp peaks associated with @xmath60 become suppressed , and a second set of peaks at higher energies @xmath61 emerge  @xcite , as shown in the lower panel of figure 5(a ) .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath62 is significantly larger than @xmath35 , and is therefore of a different physical origin from the competing order energy scale @xmath17 and appears to have been stabilized by the large tunneling currents .    based on our theoretical calculations and existing experimental observation of ours and others , we suggest that the generic temperature ( @xmath63 ) vs. doping level ( @xmath64 ) phase diagram of the cuprates is determined by the interplay of three primary energy scales : @xmath62 , @xmath17 and @xmath35 , which correspond to temperature scales of @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the case of hole - type cuprates , generally @xmath36 for a wide range of doping levels , probably due to enhanced charge transfer along the cu - o bonding as the result of significant coupling of the electronic configuration to the longitudinal optical ( lo ) phonons  @xcite , so that the co phase occurs at @xmath68 .",
    "in contrast , there is no discernible charge transfer due to the lo phonons in electron - type cuprates , and the corresponding competing order energy scale becomes much weaker so that @xmath43 . as a result , there is no apparent pseudogap associated with electron - type cuprates in the absence of external magnetic fields  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher - energy pseudogap exists in both electron- and hole - type cuprates , which may be related to spin fluctuations and thus @xmath69 . in the language of the slave - boson theory  @xcite , @xmath62",
    "may be thought of as the spinon pseudogap in the underdoped limit .",
    "hence , our proposed phase diagram in fig .",
    "5(b ) has effectively unified the seemingly puzzling asymmetric phenomena between hole- and electron - type cuprates .",
    "in particular , we may consider the spinon pseudogap phase determined by the energy scale @xmath70 as the highly degenerate `` parent phase '' of all cuprates , with antiferromagnetism ( afm ) , sc and co being the broken - symmetry phases derived from the parent phase .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the physical origin of unconventional low - energy excitations in cuprate superconductors by considering the effect of coexisting competing orders ( co ) and superconductivity ( sc ) and that of quantum fluctuations and other bosonic modes on the low - energy charge excitation spectra . by incorporating both sc and co in the bare green s function and quantum phase fluctuations in the proper self - energy , we can consistently account for various empirical findings in both hole- and electron - type cuprates . moreover , based on our tunneling spectroscopic studies and experiments of others , we suggest that there are two energy scales associated with the pseudogap phenomena , with the high - energy pseudogap @xmath62 probably of magnetic origin and the low - energy pseudogap @xmath17 associated with the competing orders .",
    "a generic phase diagram of the cuprates that unifies various asymmetric phenomena in electron- and hole - type cuprates is proposed , in which the interplay of three primary energy scales @xmath62 , @xmath17 and @xmath35 determines the ground state phases and the unconventional low - energy excitations of the cuprates .",
