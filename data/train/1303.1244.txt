    "extensions of the scalar sector of the standard model ( sm ) beyond the minimal single higgs doublet are of great interest in model building and collider phenomenology and are , as yet , largely unconstrained by experiment .",

    "spontaneous breaking of an accidental global u(1 ) symmetry is phenomenologically unacceptable because it would lead to a massless goldstone boson that couples to fermions through its mixing with the sm higgs doublet s neutral goldstone , and thus mediate new long - range forces between sm fermions .",
