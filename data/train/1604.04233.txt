    "neutrino oscillation is a well established phenomenon explained by quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "pauli first proposed the neutrino to explain the continuous spectrum of electron in beta decay  @xcite . in the standard model ( sm ) description neutrinos are massless and a very weakly interacting particles .",
    "however , in order to give a correct interpretation to the experimental results it was established that the neutrinos are massive and leptons mix  @xcite .",
    "neutrino oscillation , which implies neutrino can change from one flavor to another , is also a consequence of the neutrino masses and lepton mixing  @xcite .",
    "hence , neutrino oscillations indicate an incompleteness of the sm and opens a window for physics beyond sm .",
    "the last few years have seen an increasing interest by the physics community in reconstructing and understanding physics from a quantum information perspective , that is to say , `` it from qubit ''  @xcite .",
    "this approach will give us access to understanding various natural physical processes in the form of quantum information processing .",
    "this will also facilitate us to simulate inaccessible and experimentally demanding high energy phenomena in low energy quantum bit ( qubit ) systems .",
    "parameter tuneability in protocols that can simulate real effects allows access to different physical regimes which are not accessible in real particle physics experiments .",
    "thus , we can anticipate a significant contribution to our understanding of physics beyond known standard theories via quantum simulations .",
    "any standard quantum information processing protocols on a basic unit of quantum information , that is , the qubit , can be described using three steps : ( a ) initial state preparation , ( b ) evolution operations , and ( c ) measurements . in this work ,",
    "starting from initial state preparation of qubit we will present a scheme of evolution that can simulate the three - flavor neutrino oscillation .",
    "to simulate neutrino oscillations where the dynamics of each flavor is defined by the dirac equation , we will use discrete - time quantum walk ( dtqw ) evolution operators .",
    "the dtqw , defined as the evolution of wave packet in a superposition of position space can also be viewed as a physical dynamics of information flow @xcite which can be engineered to simulate various quantum phenomena , for example , like anderson localization  @xcite , the dirac equation  @xcite , and topologically bound states  @xcite .",
    "recent results have shown that one - dimensional dtqws produce the free dirac equation in the small mass and momentum limit  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mass eigenstates being the solution of the free dirac hamiltonian was the main motivation for us to connect the simulation of the free dirac equation and neutrino oscillation with the dtqw .",
    "this will also allow us to understand neutrino oscillation in the framework of dtqw whose dynamics is discrete- in both , space and time .",
    "the description of the dynamics in the form of a unitary operation for each discrete time step will help us to address the quantum correlations between the position space and spin degree of freedom as a function of time .",
    "this discrete approach will also lead towards simulating various high energy phenomena and addressing the dynamics of quantum correlations between different possible combination of hilbert spaces involved in the dynamics .    to simulate oscillations between three neutrino flavors we present dtqw on a system with six internal degrees of freedom which physically can be realized using a single six - dimensional system or a three - qubit system or a qubit@xmath0qutrit system . with dtqw",
    "being experimentally implemented in various physical systems  @xcite , simulation of the long and short range neutrino oscillations on different low energy physical systems will also easily be realizable as a function of the number of walk steps . by preparing different initial states , different types of neutrino oscillations",
    "can be simulated in a simple table - top experimental set - up which are not straightforward in real world neutrino oscillation experimental set - ups .    for the dtqw parameters which will simulate neutrino oscillation , we will calculate the entropy of the density matrix as a function of dtqw steps .",
    "this entropy which captures information content of the evolution of the neutrino density matrix can be effectively used to quantify the wave function delocalization in position space .",
    "we will also calculate the correlation entropy between the position space and particular neutrino flavor as measure of possible information extractable about the whole state of the neutrino wave function when we detect spin part of that particular flavor state .",
    "this simulation and information from entropy will contribute towards understanding the role of quantum correlations in neutrino oscillations reported recently  @xcite .",
    "exploring neutrino physics in general from quantum information perspective will easily be accessible .",

    "the wave function description in lattice space can be obtained by the fourier transformation in momentum space , eq.([fourier ] ) , and the span in position space will be opposite to the span in momentum space .",
    "so , larger entanglement means less uncertainty in measuring instantaneous position , and a more particle - like ( localized entity ) nature .",
    "we would like to point out that the `` delocalization of the neutrino states '' discussed in the literature@xcite , is related to the undetectability of the oscillation profile , when the oscillation wavelength ( which is directly proportional to the central momentum of the wave packet , @xmath217 ) is smaller than the spread of the neutrino wave packet in position space .",
    "but in our case , we show the relation of entanglement among spin and space with the amount of wavepacket spreading or delocalization .",
    "this wavepacket spread in position space is a property of the spatial distribution of the neutrino source wave fuction and this is uncorrelated with the neutrino oscillation wavelength .    in fig.[ententropyfig ] , we have plotted the entanglement entropy as a function of walk steps , for different value of parameter @xmath218 with the interval in @xmath219 . for the numerical simulation , @xmath220 rad ,",
    "@xmath221 has been used .    from numerical simulations",
    "it is observed that for a large number of steps the measure of entanglement is almost saturating to a fixed value and with increase in @xmath222 value the entanglement entropy saturates faster at higher value .",
    "this is a sign of the constant coupling between position space and internal degrees of freedom . for a time",
    "varying coupling in the hamiltonian , we can expect a deviation from saturation .",
    "the spin part of the @xmath223flavor neutrino can be defined by tracing out the momentum part ; @xmath224                                         = \\sum_k   | p(\\alpha , k ) |^2   \\ket{\\nu^k_\\alpha}\\bra{\\nu^{k}_\\alpha } \\nonumber\\\\                                        = \\sum_{k , m , n }   | p(\\alpha , k ) |^2 ~~   u^*_{\\alpha m } \\ket{\\nu^k_m}\\bra{\\nu^{k}_n } u_{\\alpha n }                                       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is a mixed state in general .",
    "hence , from eq.([state ] ) , considering the projection of @xmath225 $ ] , on the instantaneous state and tracing out the spin part will give a reduced density matrix corresponding to the @xmath202-flavor neutrino state ,",
    "@xmath226 \\nonumber\\\\    = \\sum_{k',k '' } \\bigg [ \\sum_{k , m , n }    \\big\\ {   | p(\\alpha , k ) |^2   p(k',e ) p^*(k'',e ) \\big\\ } \\nonumber\\\\    \\big\\ {   u^*_{en } u_{em }   u^*_{\\alpha m } u_{\\alpha n } \\big\\ } \\nonumber\\\\    \\braket{\\nu^{k''}_m | \\nu^k_m } \\braket{\\nu^{k}_n| \\nu^{k'}_n } e^{- i ( \\omega^{k'}_n - \\omega^{k''}_m ) t }   \\bigg ]   \\otimes \\ket{k'}\\bra{k''}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the entropy measure , @xmath227      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] captures a correlation between the @xmath202-flavor and position - space ( or momentum - space ) . in eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) we are not taking the trace over the whole coin space , we are projecting on a mixed state @xmath228 , so this entropy is not actually the entanglement measure between @xmath202-flavor and position space .",
    "however , we can claim that this entropy can still be used as a correlation measure , particularly , to comparatively understand the trend of correlations of different flavor with the position space . in fig.[flavourcorrelation1 ] we show this measure of correlation when , @xmath229 as a function of steps of walk evolution when the value of @xmath230 in fig.[flavourcorrelation1 ] we see the increase in entropy in the beginning with increase in the number of steps and later all the three flavors show an identical trend in decrease and increase of the entropy around the mean value .",
    "when the same measure is cosidered for a very large number of steps , shown in fig.[flavourcorrelation2 ] , we see fluctuations around the mean value without any well - defined pattern in fluctuation and these fluctuations show an identical trend for all flavors . from this",
    "we can say that each flavor is equally correlated with the position space during the propagation .",
    "in ref.@xcite it is shown that the entanglement between the coin and position space of dtqw with strongly localization but not being localized at one node ( spatial disorder walk ) is smaller when compared to the wide spread localized state ( temporal disordered walk ) .",
    "therefore , from the absence of zero correlation at any point of time we can conclude that the neutrino flavor is not localized in position space at any given point .",
    "however , the degree of delocalization can be varied by changing the value of @xmath222 . a comparatively higher correlation would mean a more widely spread wave packet .",
    "neutrinos are very weakly interacting particles , so if the detectors are large in size detection of a significant number of the neutrinos is possible . for neutrino oscillation experiments",
    "various kinds of detector are used ; for example , the detector super - kamiokande  @xcite uses 50,000 tons of ultra - pure water and sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite uses 1000 tonnes of ultra - pure heavy water . simulating neutrino oscillation and other high energy phenomena in a low energy experimental set - up gives access to intricate features of the dynamics , which is not easy in a high energy set - up . in this work",
    "we have shown that the three flavor neutrino oscillation obtained from this massive experimental set - up can be simulated using a dtqw system with a set of walk evolution parameters .",
    "using dtqw , short range oscillations and long range oscillations have been obtained by simply varying the number of steps of the walk .",
    "dtqw has been experimentally implemented using trapped ions @xcite , cold atoms @xcite , nmr @xcite , and photons @xcite ; therefore , neutrino oscillations can be simulated in any of these systems .",
    "in addition to simulating neutrino oscillation , our work indicates that the quantum walk can play an important role in simulating and understanding dynamics of various other physical processes in nature . with these simulations mapping to real experimental measurements gives us access to exploring quantum correlations like entanglement and understanding the neutrino physics and high energy physics in general from the quantum information perspective .",
    "here we introduced a correlation measure between flavor and position space that will give information as regards the spatial degrees of freedom of the neutrino , by detection of a particular flavor . simulating a high energy quantum dynamics in a low energy quantum system and understanding",
    "physical phenomena from the quantum information theory perspective is an important topic of interest in contemporary research .",
    "a preprint of this paper , arxiv:1604.04233@xcite has already motivated research in this direction by considering the extension towards simulation of the neutrino oscillation in matter using dtqw @xcite without overlapping with the results shown in this paper .",
