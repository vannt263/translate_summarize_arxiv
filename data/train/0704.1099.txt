    "1979 epps reported results showing that stock return correlations decrease as the sampling frequency of data increases @xcite . since his discovery the phenomenon has been detected in several studies of different stock markets @xcite and foreign exchange markets @xcite .",
    "cross - correlations between the individual assets are the main factors in classical portfolio management thus it is important to understand and give their accurate description on different time scales .",
    "this is especially so , since today the time scale in adjusting portfolios to events occuring may be in the order of minutes .",
    "considerable effort has been devoted to uncover the phenomenon found by epps @xcite .",
    "however most of the works aim to construct a better statistical measure for co - movements in prices in order to exclude bias of the estimator by microstructure effects @xcite , only a few searching for the description of the microstructure dynamics .    up to now two main factors causing the effect",
    "have been revealed : the first one is a possible lead - lag effect between stock returns @xcite which can appear mainly between stocks of very different capitalisation and/or for some functional dependencies between them . in this case",
    "the maximum of the time - dependent cross - correlation function can be found at non zero time lag , resulting in increasing cross - correlations as the sampling time scale gets into the same order of magnitude as the characteristic lag .",
    "this factor can be easily understood , morever , in a recent study @xcite we showed that through the years this effect becomes less important as the characteristic time lag shrinks , signalising an increasing efficiency of stock markets .",
    "as the epps effect can also be found for the case when no lead - lag effect is present , in the following we will focus only on other possible factors .",
    "the second , more important factor is the asynchronicity of ticks in case of different stocks @xcite .",
    "empirical results @xcite showed that taking into account only the synchronous ticks reduces to a great degree the epps effect , i.e. measured correlations on short sampling time scale increase .",
    "naturally one would expect that for a given sampling frequency growing activity decreases the asynchronicity , leading to a weaker epps effect .",
    "indeed monte carlo experiments showed an inverse relation between trading activity and the correlation drop @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis of empirical data showed @xcite that the explanation of the effect solely by asynchronicity is not satisfactory . after eliminating the effect of changing asymptotic cross - correlations through the years ( scaling with the asymptotic value ) ,",
    "the curves of cross - correlation as a function of sampling time scale tend to collapse to one curve and surprisingly we do not find a measurable reduction of the characteristic time of the epps effect , while the trading frequency grew by a factor of @xmath3 in the period .",
    "these results will be discussed further in details in section [ activity ] .",
    "the characteristic time of market phenomena can usually be split up into three kinds of market time scales : the frequency of trading on the market ( which we will denote as _ activity _ ) , market periodicities and the reaction time of traders to news , events . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the characteristic time of the epps effect does not scale with changing market activity ( this we will discuss in section [ activity ] ) , which points out that the characteristic time of the epps effect can not be determined solely by the market activity causing asynchronicity .",
    "market periodicities in high frequency data are the different types of patterns , which can be found in intraday data , as well as on broader time scales ( see e.g. refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "market periodicities and intraday structure do not have a role in our results since we are averaging them out .",
    "hence we believe that the characteristic time of the epps effect is the outcome of a human time scale present on the market : the time that market participants need to react to certain pieces of news .",
    "there are several studies in the literature about reaction time .",
    "the issue is connected both to behavioural finance questions and to market efficiency .",
    "1970 , fama defined an efficient market as one in which prices fully reflect all available information @xcite .",
    "this response to information in practice can not happen instantaneously .",
    "there are several results reporting that prices incorporate news within five to fifteen minutes after news announcements @xcite .",
    "more recent studies showed similar results on the time that traders needed to react to news @xcite .",
    "supposing that the epps effect is possibly the outcome of a human time scale present on the market motivated us to separate the terms in the cross - correlation function , in order to study their behaviour one by one . in this paper",
    "we suggest an analytic decomposition of the cross - correlation function of asynchronous events using time lagged correlations . as a second step",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency of the formalism on the example of generated data . finally we describe and fit the empirically observed dependence of the cross - correlations .",
    "we find that the origin of the independence of the characteristic time of the epps effect on the trading frequency is the presence of a human time scale in the time lagged autocorrelation functions .",
    "@xcite already called the attention to the importance of lagged cross - influences of stock returns in explaining the epps - effect . using a somewhat different formalism , here we investigate thoroughly this relationship .",
    "the paper is built up as follows : in section [ empirical ] we present the data used and discuss the problems of the former descriptions .",
    "section [ theory ] the decomposition of the cross - correlation coefficient , section [ model ] shows a simulation model demonstrating the idea . in section [ application ]",
    "we present the assumptions concerning real data and show fits and statistics for the epps curves .",
    "we finish the paper with a discussion .",
    "in our analysis we used the trade and quote ( taq ) database of the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) for the period of 4.1.1993 to 31.12.2003 , containing tick - by - tick data .",
    "the data used was adjusted for dividends and splits .",
    "we computed the logarithmic returns of stock prices : @xmath4 where @xmath5 stands for the price of stock _ a _ at time @xmath6 .",
    "the prices were determined using previous tick estimator on the high frequency data , i.e. prices are defined constant between two consecutive trades .",
    "the time dependent cross - correlation function @xmath7 of stocks _ a _ and _ b _ is defined by    @xmath8    the notion @xmath9 stands for the time average over the considered period : @xmath10 where time is measured in seconds and _ t _ is the time span of the data .",
    "the standard deviation @xmath11 of the returns reads as : @xmath12 both for @xmath13 and @xmath14 in .",
    "we computed correlations for each day separately and averaged over the set of days , this way avoiding large overnight returns and trades out of the market opening hours . for pairs of stocks with a lead ",
    "lag effect the function @xmath15 has a peak at non - zero @xmath16 .",
    "the equal - time cross - correlation coefficient is naturally : @xmath17 . in our notations",
    "the epps effect means the decrease of @xmath18 as @xmath19 decreases ( see figure [ fig : example ] ) .",
    "since the prices are defined as being constant between two consecutive trades , the @xmath19 time scale of the sampling can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "[ t][b][4][0]@xmath19 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath20    as stated above , we do not want to discuss the epps effect originated from the lead - lag effect in the correlations .",
    "thus we consider only pairs of stocks where the latter effect is negligible , i.e. , for which the price changes are highly correlated with the peak position of @xmath15 of equation being at @xmath21 .",
    "the results shown in this paper can be generalised for all stock pairs ( though in case of an empirical study one can never fit all data ) . to illustrate our results we will present results for some stock pairs and in section [ application ]",
    "we will show statisitcs for a broader set of data .",
    "the stocks mentioned in the paper are the following : avon products , inc .",

    "previous studies claimed the asynchronicity of ticks for different stocks as the main cause of the epps effect @xcite .",
    "it is natural to assume that , for a given sampling frequency , increasing trading activity should enhance synchronicity , leading to a weaker epps effect",
    ".    to study the trading frequency dependence of the cross - correlation drop , we computed the epps curve separately for different years . in figure",
    "[ fig : epps_years ] the cross - correlation coefficients can be seen as a function of the sampling time scale for the years 1993 , 1997 , 2000 and 2003 for three example stock pairs .",
    "[ t][b][4][0]@xmath19 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath22 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath20 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath23    it is known that cross - correlation coefficients are not constant through the years .",
    "the asymptotic values of cross - correlations ( long sampling time scale ) depend on the economical situation , the state of the economic sectors that the pairs of stocks belong to , and several other factors .",
    "we need to take this into account and try to extract the effect of changing asymptotic cross - correlations from the epps phenomenon . in order to get comparable curves , we scaled the cross - correlation curves with their asymptotic value : the latter was defined as the mean of the cross - correlation coefficients for the sampling time scales @xmath24 seconds through @xmath25 seconds , and the cross - correlations were divided by this value .",
    "figure [ fig : epps_years_scaled ] shows the scaled curves for the same years and pairs as figure [ fig : epps_years ] .",
    "[ t][b][4][0]@xmath19 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]scaled @xmath22 [ b][t][4][0]scaled @xmath20 [ b][t][4][0]scaled",
    "@xmath23    the frequency of trades changed considerably in the last two decades : trading activity has grown almost monotonically , as it can be seen in figure [ fig : activity ] .",
    "this would infer the diminution of the epps effect and a much weaker decrease of the correlations as sampling frequency is increased .",
    "however , after scaling with the asymptotic cross - correlation value , the curves give a reasonable data collapse and no systematic trend can be seen .",
    "surprisingly , as it can be seen in table [ table : t_e ] , a rise of the trading frequency by a factor of @xmath3 does not lead to a measurable reduction of the characteristic time of the epps effect ( where we define the characteristic time the time scale for which the cross - correlation reaches the @xmath26 rate of its asymptotic value ) .    [ t][b][4][0]years [ b][t][4][0]average intertrade time [ sec ]    these results show that explaining the epps effect merely as a result of the asynchronicity of ticks is not satisfactory .",
    "it is also important to mention that not even the changing tick sizes for the stocks ( likely to change the arrival rate of price changes ) alter the characteristic time of the effect .",
    "in this section we show calculations for the relation between the value of cross - correlations on different time scales .",
    "we connect the cross - correlation on a certain time scale ( @xmath19 ) to lagged autocorrelations and cross - correlations on smaller time scales ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "returns in a certain time window @xmath19 are mere sums of returns in smaller , non - overlapping windows @xmath28 , where @xmath19 is a multiple of @xmath28 :    @xmath29    using this relationship the time average of the product of returns on the large time scale ( @xmath19 ) can be written in terms of the averages on the short time scale ( @xmath27 ) in the following way :    @xmath30    we can see that on the right side of equation the lagged time average of return products appear on the short time scale , @xmath27 , i.e. , the non - trivial part of the lagged cross - correlations . naturally in the case of @xmath31",
    ", we get the relation for @xmath32 .    in order to apply equation",
    ", we need to have information about the lagged autocorrelation and cross - correlation functions .",
    "writing out the sum in eq .",
    "we get :    @xmath33    and similarly @xmath34    since the mean of returns is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the second moments in the correlation function , we can omit the expressions @xmath35 and @xmath36 in equation . as these terms are of second order , this can even be done in case of slight price trends .",
    "hence equation becomes :    @xmath37    for simplicity , we introduce decay functions to describe lagged correlations :    @xmath38    defined for both positive and negative @xmath39 values , and similarly @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "thus the correlation can be written in the following form :    @xmath42    hence    @xmath43    this way we obtained an expression of the cross - correlation coefficient for any sampling time scale , @xmath19 , by knowing the coefficient on a shorter sampling time scale , @xmath27 , and the decay of lagged autocorrelations and cross - correlations on the same shorter sampling time scale ( given that @xmath19 is multiple of @xmath27 ) .",
    "our method is to measure the correlations and fit their decay functions on a certain short time scale and compute the epps curve using the above formula .",
    "in this section we demonstrate the decomposition process on computer generated time series which should mimic two correlated return series .",
    "we will demonstrate the epps effect and see how the decomposition works for these controlled cases .",
    "our aim is to show that in case of generated `` price '' series , the decomposition process leads to a very good description of the time scale dependence of the cross - correlation coefficients .",
    "more discussion and details on the analytic treatment of the model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to mimic some properties of financial data , we simulate two correlated but asynchronous price time series . as a first step",
    "we generate a core random walk with unit steps up or down in each second with equal possibility ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "second we sample the random walk , @xmath44 , twice independently with waiting times drawn from an exponential distribution .",
    "this way we obtain two time series ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , which are correlated since they are sampled from the same core random walk , but the steps in the two walks are asynchronous .",
    "the core random walk is :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is @xmath49 with equal probability ( and @xmath50 is set high in order to avoid negative values ) .",
    "the two price time series are determined by    @xmath51    from the core random walk , where , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are drawn from an exponential distribution : @xmath55 with parameter @xmath56 .",
    "a snapshot as an example of the generated time series with exponentially distributed waiting times can be seen on figure [ fig : model ] .",

    "we know that @xmath60 without having to make any assumptions . of course having a random walk model , the autocorrelation function of the steps is zero for all non - zero time lags :    @xmath61    thus    @xmath62    hence the cross - correlation can be written in the following form :    @xmath63\\rho_{\\delta t_0}^{a / b}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the model case we set the smallest time scale @xmath64 time step .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that in the case of @xmath65 ( small density of ticks ) the exact analytical expression for the cross - correlations is identical to with an exponential decay function :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the parameter of the original exponential distribution used for sampling .",
    "further results and exact computations of the cross - correlations for the model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : model_epps_fit ] shows the computed cross - correlations of the generated time series on several sampling time scales and the computed cross - correlations using equation and the exponential decay function .",
    "the two curves are in very good agreement showing that the decomposition procedure is able to well capture the epps effect for generated time series .",
    "[ t][b][4][0]@xmath68 [ simulation steps ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath69",
    "in this section we discuss the properties of the decay functions in case of real world data , and inserting them into equation we derive analytical fits for the measured epps curves .",
    "as discussed , we measure the equal - time cross - correlations and the decay of cross and autocorrelations on a certain short sampling time scale and from these we obtain the value of equal - time cross - correlations on larger sampling time scales . to do this , in case of the toy model , we had the possibility of using the smallest time scale available in the generated data as @xmath27 , i.e. , the resolution being one simulation step .",
    "when studying data from real world markets , one has to make restrictions . as being the highest resolution commonly used in financial analysis , it would be plausible to choose windows of one second as @xmath27 .",
    "however on this time scale one is only able to measure noise , no valid correlations and decay functions can be found .",
    "thus we had to use less dense data for the smallest sampling time scale : in the results shown below we set @xmath70 seconds . using this resolution we get an acceptable signal - to - noise ratio and we hope not to lose too much information compared to higher frequencies .    to avoid new parameters in the model we use the raw decay functions in the formula , without fitting them .",
    "since it is an empirical approach to determine the decay functions for real data , we have to distinguish the signal from the noise in the decay functions . concerning the sensitivity from the input ( decay function ) we observed that the results are quite robust against little changes in the input functions , however the noise in the tail can cause significant deviations . according to this we take into account the decay functions for correlations only for short time lags . for the decay of the cross - correlations we take into account the function only up to the time lag where the decaying signal reaches zero for the first time , for larger lags we assume it to be zero . for the decay of autocorrelations",
    "we take into the account the function only up to the time lag where after the negative overshoot of the beginning it decays to zero from below for the first time , for larger lags we assume it to be zero .",
    "figure [ fig : decay ] shows an example of the decay functions in case of the stock pair ko / pep ( for other pairs the decay functions are very much similar ) .",
    "the plot shows the decay functions up to the time lags of 1000 seconds , with a vertical line showing how long we take the empirical decays into account .",
    "we can see that the time lag for which the decay functions disappear is in the order of a few minutes .",
    "in fact in case of all stock pairs studied we found the decay disappearing after 515 minutes .",
    "[ t][b][4][0]@xmath71 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath72 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath73 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath74      inserting the empirical decay of lagged autocorrelations and cross - correlations on the short time scale into the formula of equation , we compare the computed and the measured epps curves .",
    "figures [ fig : fit1 ] , [ fig : fit2 ] and [ fig : fit3 ] show these plots for a few example stock pairs .",
    "[ t][b][4][0]@xmath19 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath75 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath76    [ t][b][4][0]@xmath19 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath77 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath78    [ t][b][4][0]@xmath19 [ sec ] [ b][t][4][0]@xmath79 [ b][t][4][0]@xmath80    one can see , that the fits are able to describe the change of cross - correlation with increasing sampling time scale .",
    "note , that as it has been shown in section [ theory ] , in the analytical formula only the autocorrelations and cross - correlations on the smallest time scale ( @xmath27 ) and the decay functions are taken into account as input to compute the cross - correlations on all other time scales , no additional parameters are used .    to show a broader set of results , we introduce a goodness parameter for the agreement between the measured and the analytically determined epps curves .",
    "we define the goodness parameter as the absolute error between the measured and the analytically computed points :    @xmath81    table [ table : goodness ] shows the maximum , the mean and the median of the goodness parameters for a broader set of stocks .",
    "the results show that the absolute mean error is very low , with a maximum around 7 percents and both a mean and a median around 2 percents .",
    "it is important to mention , that the maximal error is usually found for high frequency scales , for longer time scales and especially for the asymptotic correlation value the aggrement is very good .",
    "these results show that the growing cross - correlations with decreasing sampling frequency are due to finite time decay of the lagged autocorrelations and cross - correlations in the high frequency sampled data .",
    "the finite decay of the cross - correlations on the short time scale ( @xmath27 ) is not caused by difference in the capitalisation of the two stocks or functional dependencies between them .",
    "instead , it is an artifact of the market microstructure .",
    "reaction to a certain piece of news is usually spread out on an interval of a few minutes for the stocks @xcite due to human trading nature , thus not scaling with activity , with ticks being distributed more or less randomly .",
    "this means that correlated returns are spread out for this interval ( asynchronously ) , causing non zero lagged cross - correlations on the short time scale and thus the epps effect .",
    "this way , as stated by ref .",
    "@xcite , the asynchronicity is indeed important in describing the epps effect but only in promoting the lagged correlations .",
    "( even in case of completely synchronous , but randomly spread ticks we could have the finite decay of lagged correlations on short time scale , and hence the epps effect . )",
    "in our study we examined the causes of the epps effect , the dependence of stock return cross - correlations on sampling time scale .",
    "we showed that explaining the effect solely through asynchronicity of price ticks is not satisfactory .",
    "when scaling the epps curves with their asymptotic value for different years , we get a reasonable data collapse and a growing activity of the order @xmath3 does not affect the characteristic time of the epps effect .",
    "the main point of our calculations is that we connected the cross - correlations on longer time scales to the lagged autocorrelations and cross - correlations on any shorter time scale .",
    "we demonstrated the idea of these calculations on a random walk asynchronous model of prices , getting a very good agreement with the cross - correlation curves .    assuming the time average of stock returns",
    "to be zero we were able to decompose the expression for the cross - correlation coefficient deriving an analytical formula of the cross - correlations on any time scale , given the decay of the autocorrelations and cross - correlations on a certain short time scale .",
    "with this analytical formula we were able to give fits to the epps curves of real stock pairs getting acceptable results .",
    "the fits show that the epps effect is caused by the finite time decay of the lagged correlations in the high frequency sampled data .",
    "the reason for the characteristic time not changing with growing activity is a human time scale present in the phenomenon , which does not scale with the changing inter - tick time .",
    "the finite decay of lagged correlations on the short time scale is due to market microstructure properties : different actors on the market have different time horizons of interest resulting in the reactions to certain pieces of news being spread out for a time interval of a few minutes .",
    "the correlated returns ranging over this interval cause the finite time decay of lagged correlations on the short time scale resulting in the epps effect .",
    "our results do not contradict to the earlier observations on the importance of asynchronicity in the epps - effect , however , its role has been put into a new perspective .",
