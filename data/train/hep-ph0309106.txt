    "after the discovery of top quark , directly searching for higgs boson and studying its property are the main goals of the high energy colliders . in the electroweak minimal standard model(msm )",
    ", higgs mechanism generates electroweak symmetry breaking and the yukawa coupling terms between higgs boson and fermions in the lagrangian @xcite . in the sm",
    ", the yukawa term reads @xmath18 .",
    "there the coupling strength of the fermion - higgs yukawa coupling @xmath19 is predicted as @xmath20 at the tree level , where @xmath21  gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "since the top quark is the heaviest fermion , the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath22 should be the strongest one among all the fermion - higgs couplings , e.g. , @xmath23 to be compared for example with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , the higgs boson production associated with a top - quark pair production process is particularly important in collider physics for probing the top - quark yukawa coupling with the intermediate mass of higgs boson .",
    "recently , lep2 experiments have provided a lower bound of @xmath25  gev for the sm higgs boson mass at the @xmath26 confidence level@xcite .",
    "the future linear colliders ( lc ) will continue the work in searching for higgs boson and studying its property .",
    "there have been already some detailed designs of linear colliders , such as nlc@xcite , jlc@xcite , tesla@xcite and clic@xcite .",
    "although the cross section for @xmath27 process is small at a lc , about @xmath16  fb for @xmath28  gev and @xmath29  gev @xcite , it has a distinctive experimental signature and can potentially be used to measure the top - quark yukawa coupling with intermediate higgs mass at a lc with very high luminosity .    as we know the apparently the clean signal for light higgs boson production associated with a top quark pair is @xmath30 in both semileptonic and fully hadronic decay channels",
    "this leads to multi - jet event topologies involving at lest 6 or more jets in the final state , with @xmath31 b - jets and multi - jet invariant mass constraints .",
    "obviously , its measurement has many difficulties , for example , the tiny signal with backgrounds about 3 orders of magnitude larger , the limitations of jet - clustering algorithm in properly reconstructing multi - jets in the final state , and the degradation of b - tagging performance due to hard gluon radiation and jet mixing .",
    "the potential backgrounds are from the @xmath32 and @xmath2 productions .",
    "the dominant electroweak background is : @xmath33 the largest background is from radiative top quark decay : @xmath34 since the b - jets resulting from the gluon splitting are logarithmically enhanced at low energy , cuts on the jet energy are efficient at eliminating this background@xcite .",
    "the weak corrections to @xmath35 should involve the real emissions of @xmath36 and @xmath37 gauge bosons .",
    "these may be other sources of electroweak backgrounds .",
    "our calculation shows that the cross section of the real emission of @xmath37 gauge boson in @xmath38 production via @xmath3 collision is under @xmath39 of the @xmath35 process , and can be neglected in our analysis , while for the real @xmath36 emission @xmath38 production the cross section is in the same order as that of the @xmath35 process . in principle , these backgrounds can easily be removed by using the constraints due to the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 masses with perfect b - tagging and reconstruction of multi - jets",
    ". however , this may not be true in practice .",
    "the experimental situation of the signal detection of @xmath38 production will be even worse , considering the following two fields .",
    "firstly , the detectors have a finite coverage in polar angle",
    ". some of these real @xmath36 bosons can be emitted so close to the beam direction that part of their decay products may well escape detection .",
    "secondly , all three particles in the @xmath38 final state are highly unstable , and would decay in the detector . if @xmath42 , it would mostly produce @xmath43 pairs . if above , it would yield four fermions , either leptons / neutrinos or quarks , principally via @xmath44 decays .",
    "besides , top quark(anti - quark ) decays into three objects , a @xmath45-quark and the decay products of the @xmath36 , leptons / neutrinos or quarks .",
    "hence , at tree level in these decays , we are looking at 8- or 10-fermion final states . in the most likely case in which",
    "the fermions arising from the @xmath36 decays are quarks , additional ( mainly gluon ) radiation will take place , so that at detector level more than 10 jets may be extracted . therefore , the additional real @xmath36 radiation and @xmath32 production entering the detector region could be uneasy to resolved through their decay products in the data samples of @xmath38 events .",
    "expected experimental accuracy for determination of the @xmath46 coupling in @xmath27 process has been discussed in many literatures for specialized linear collider .",
    "they show that the experimental accuracy depends very much on the b - tagging efficiency .",
    "for example , the top quark yukawa coupling can be measured to @xmath47 accuracy with integral luminosity @xmath48 at an @xmath49 linear collider with @xmath50 , assuming @xmath51 efficiency for b - jet tagging and including statistic but not systematic errors .",
    "the accuracy of the measurement drops to @xmath52 if only a @xmath53 efficiency for b - tagging is achieved @xcite .",
    "the references @xcite also stated that the precise determination of the top - higgs coupling via the measurement of @xmath27 process can reach the accuracy of few percent . therefore ,",
    "if we assume the machine and detector are very efficient and the background processes can be distinguished substantially , the evaluation of radiative corrections could be significant for the accurate experimental measurements of @xmath27 process . in ref.@xcite , s. dawson and l. reina presented the nlo qcd corrections to process @xmath27 . and in references @xcite the electroweak corrections to the process @xmath27",
    "are calculated .",
    "the supersymmetric electroweak corrections to process @xmath27 were already discussed by x.h .",
    "wu , et al@xcite .",
    "an @xmath6 lc can also be designed to operate as a @xmath54 collider .",
    "this is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial @xmath6 beams .",
    "the resulting @xmath55 center of mass system ( cms ) energy is peaked at about @xmath56 for the appropriate choices of machine parameters . in @xmath54 collision mode at the high energy peak",
    ", we may get approximately the same luminosity as that of @xmath6 collision . with the new possibility of @xmath57 collisions at electron - positron linear colliders , the production process @xmath8 offers another approach to probe directly the top - higgs coupling in addition to @xmath58 and @xmath59 processes . to detect the higgs boson associated with a top - quark pair in high colliding energy ,",
    "@xmath3 collision has an outstanding advantage over @xmath6 collision due to its relative larger production rate .",
    "the reason is that at the tree level the @xmath27 process has a ` s - channel suppression ' from the virtual photon and @xmath37 propagators , especially for the heavy masses of the final particles .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the @xmath8 process provides a better approach than @xmath6 collision to produce @xmath46 .",
    "similar with the measurement of the process @xmath27 , the evaluation of radiative corrections for process @xmath35 is also significant for the accurate experimental measurements of top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "the born cross section of @xmath8 process was calculated already in previous work of ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we neglect the real gauge boson radiation effects and present the calculations of the @xmath0 qcd and @xmath4 electroweak corrections to @xmath8 in the sm .",
    "we draw a comparison between our numerical results of born cross sections of @xmath35 and those in ref.@xcite .",
