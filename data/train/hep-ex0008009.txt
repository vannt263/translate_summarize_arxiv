    "a recent revival of interest in event shapes has been prompted by theoretical developments in the understanding of hadronisation @xcite .",
    "these approaches extend perturbative qcd calculations into the region of low momentum transfers using approximations to higher - order graphs ; the hadronisation contributions are expected to go as @xmath4 where @xmath8 is an integer power ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 scale at hera can be varied over four orders of magnitude allowing these corrections to be studied in detail .",
    "the data are compared to theoretical expectations for power corrections , characterised by @xmath12 and an effective coupling @xmath13 specified at the infrared matching scale @xmath14  @xmath2 , and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) calculations , determined by @xmath12 .",
    "a suitable frame of reference in which to study event shapes is the breit frame since this frame maximises the separation between the current jet from the struck quark and the proton remnant .",
    "viewed in this frame the exchanged gauge boson is purely spacelike and the incoming qpm quark is back - scattered with equal and opposite momentum ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the breit frame also permits the event shapes from the spacelike process in dis to be compared directly to the event shapes in the timelike @xmath16 process .",
    "two classes of event shapes are studied .",
    "the first class are those confined to the current region of the breit frame ( @xmath17 ) , namely , thrust , both with respect to the breit frame axis ( @xmath18 ) and the thrust axis ( @xmath19 ) , jet broadening with respect to the breit frame axis ( @xmath20 ) , jet - mass ( @xmath21 ) , and the @xmath0-parameter ( c ) .",
    "thrust ( @xmath18 ) and jet broadening ( @xmath20 ) are measured with respect to the breit frame axis and are therefore specific to dis ; the remainder can also be defined in @xmath16 experiments . at the hadron level , the h1 result @xcite assumes the hadrons have their true mass , the zeus result assumes the hadrons have zero mass ; this difference in definition only affects the jet - mass which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeush1 ] . here",
    "the data are compared and the other variables show agreement between the two data sets .",
    "zeus bin in kinematic ranges of both @xmath22 and @xmath3 , so in some regions zeus have two data points measured over the same range in @xmath3 but a different range in @xmath22 ; h1 integrate over @xmath22 . in order to keep the variables infrared safe",
    ", the total energy in the current region has to exceed 10% ( 3% ) of the total available energy , for h1 ( zeus ) .",
    "the exact value of this cut is not critical .",
    "the second class of variables are the two - jet rates .",
    "these are measured over the full phase space of the breit frame in which @xmath23 jets are searched for ; the @xmath24 denotes the proton remnant .",
    "both the @xmath25 ( or durham ) and the factorisable jade scheme are used in which a jet merging criteria based on distance measures @xmath26 between pairs of particles is defined .",
    "the event shape @xmath27 denotes the value of @xmath26 at which the transition @xmath28 jets occurs .",
    "the mean values of these event shapes can be interpreted theoretically as @xmath29 where @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 being calculable coefficients of pqcd , here determined by the disent nlo program @xcite with renormalisation / factorisation scales set at @xmath33 . a simple form for @xmath34 of @xmath35 or",
    "@xmath36 has been ruled out by h1 data @xcite .",
    "a more sopisticated approach @xcite introduces @xmath37    \\label{eqn : powc}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the power , @xmath38 is a calculable @xmath39-dependent coefficient and @xmath40 @xcite is a two - loop level refinement to the calculations called the milan factor .",
    "fits of eq ( [ eqn : sumit ] ) to zeus data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeusfit1 ] .",
    "the shaded band indicates the theoretical uncertainty on @xmath41 from varying the renormalisation scale by a factor of @xmath10 to @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; this is the dominant uncertainty on the measurement .",
    "the fitted values of the two parameters @xmath12 and @xmath44 from h1 and zeus data are plotted in figs . 3 and 4 as contours ( theoretical errors such as the scale dependence",
    "are not included in the contours ) .",
    "the h1 result shows the @xmath45 and @xmath46 contours for statistical and experimental systematic errors combined in quadrature .",
    "the smaller contours in the zeus result are a statistical only fit , the larger ones are the @xmath46 contours for the statistical and systematic errors combined in quadrature . large correlations between @xmath12 and @xmath44 are seen for @xmath47 but less for the other variables .",
    "both experiments fit an approximately universal @xmath48 .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath12 for the @xmath16-type variables ( @xmath0-parameter , jet - mass and thrust w.r.t .",
    "thrust axis ) are compatible for the zeus result and remarkably close for the h1 result . including the dis specific variables ( thrust and broadening w.r.t .",
    "breit axis ) sees a larger spread in the fitted values of @xmath12 .",
    "possible explanations are missing higher order qcd corrections or incomplete knowledge of the power correction coefficients",
    ".        fits to h1 two - jet rate data are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : h1jet ] @xcite . the hadronisation correction is seen to be small for these variables . for the @xmath49 from the factorisable jade algorithm , table [",
    "table : yfj ] shows that the fitted value of @xmath44 is unreasonably low with the conjectured @xmath38 factor of @xmath50 . instead",
    ", a much more reasonable fit can be obtained by allowing the power corrections to become small and negative , with an @xmath38 factor of @xmath51 .",
    "the power fit for the @xmath49 from the @xmath25 algorithm is of special interest because the power @xmath8 is expected to be 2 instead of 1 as it is for all the other variables .",
    "the h1 data are inconsistent with a fit using @xmath52 .",
    "the data are consistent with @xmath53 but a more qualitative statement can not be made given current experimental precision on this variable and the fact that the theoretical @xmath38 factor for this variable is unknown .",
    "zeus have also studied the @xmath22-dependence of the power correction fits .",
    "figure [ fig : zeusx ] shows the result of omitting the lower @xmath22 bins from the zeus data given in fig . [ fig : zeush1 ] ; plotted are the statistical contours only .",
    "most of the variables display little sensitivity to @xmath22 .",
    "however , a large effect is seen in the jet broadening where the fitted values of @xmath12 and @xmath44 shift considerably .",
    "this confirms recent theoretical comment @xcite that the @xmath38 factor for jet broadening should contain @xmath22-dependent terms that are , as yet , unknown .    in conclusion ,",
    "this new theoretical approach to hadronisation works very well given its simplicity , although there remain some theoretical questions particularly in the @xmath22-dependence of the dis specific variables .",
