    "sio masers are found in a variety of evolved giant and super - giant stars , including miras , semi - regular variables , m super - giants , and oh / ir stars .",
    "giant and supergiant stellar atmospheres and their mass loss mechanisms are not fully understood : convection and composition variations are complex , and detailed atmospheric models are just emerging .",
    "the location of sio masers , close to the photospheres , makes them useful probes of the extended atmospheres and the mass loss phenomenon .",
    "spectroscopy of evolved stars has shown significant variability in maser intensities and line widths @xcite .",
    "@xmath6sio ( hereafter simply sio ) masers have been observed in rotational transitions from to and from vibrational states to , from frequencies of 43 ghz to 302 ghz @xcite .",
    "vlbi observations have revealed that the masers are generally located in ring structures in the circumstellar envelopes @xcite .",
    "ring radii typically range from 1.5 to 4 stellar radii .",
    "since the observed rings present themselves perpendicular to the line of sight , it has been postulated that the masing takes place on the surfaces of spheres centered on the stars , and that the masing radiation escapes tangentially to the spheres .",
    "combined with the tangential polarization vectors , this structure has been taken as evidence for radiative pumping of the masers ( desmurs et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "previous observations of some miras indicated that individual maser spectral features appeared to persist throughout entire stellar cycles ( e.g. , clark et al .",
    "however , the continuity of maser features was also found to be disrupted at various times throughout the stellar cycles , including at maximum light ( e.g. , clark , troland , & miller 1985 ) and at sio maser brightness minimum ( martinez , bujarrabal , & alcolea 1998 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the masers are created anew by periodic shock waves propagating through the extended atmospheres and lagging the optical maximum by about @xmath7 periods @xcite .",
    "recent numerical models have been used to simulate the sio maser variability with a constant infrared radiation field combined with shocks ( humphreys et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to investigate the relationship between maser variability and stellar cycle",
    ", we observed the 86.2434 ghz sio ( , ; antenna temperature and polarization ) transition in 17 evolved stars during eight epochs over two and a half years .",
    "our observations are not densely sampled enough to investigate the detailed evolution of masers in any star within a stellar cycle .",
    "however , the large survey size , with sampling up to four stellar cycles per star , enables us to quantify the long - term polarization behavior of the masers , complementary to detailed studies of individual stars . ",
    "[ sec : obs ] describes our observations and  [ sec : data ] presents the results and discussion .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in  [",
    "sec : conc ] .",
    "the observations were made with the facility polarimeter and 3-mm receivers at the nrao 12 meter telescope on kitt peak in standard position - switching mode .",
    "a parallel - wire grid and mirror combination , with a tuned separation acting as a half - waveplate , modulated the polarization .",
    "the waveplate was stepped to 16 positions per rotation , allowing for four independent measurements of polarization per rotation .",
    "systematic , instrumental polarization was measured with observations of planets , and found to be small ( @xmath8% ) compared to the observed stellar polarizations .",
    "the orthogonal senses of polarization were split by another parallel - wire grid and transmitted to two receivers .",
    "the polarization efficiency and position angle were calibrated with a linearly - polarized noise source mounted at the center of the subreflector .",
    "the parallactic angle correction was verified with observations of the crab nebula .",
    "we used two 128-channel filter bank backends for each receiver , with 100 khz and 250 khz resolutions , corresponding to 348 and 870 m s@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the 250 khz spectra were used only to cross - check the 100 khz spectra .",
    "each star was observed one or more times per day , weather permitting , during the following eight epochs : 1995 april , 1995 october , 1996 march , 1996 july , 1996 september , 1997 february , 1997 june , and 1997 october .",
    "calibration was done on the @xmath10 scale .",
    "the conversion factor to flux density is 32 jy / k@xmath11 . the stellar phases and periods",
    "were derived from kholopov ( 2002 ) and the aavso data base ( http://www.aavso.org/adata/onlinedata/ ) . throughout this paper , the stellar phases are referred to the optical maxima .",
    "the spectra and polarizations for each star for each epoch are displayed in figures 8 to 24 ..",
    "the peak line temperatures vary dramatically , up to nearly a factor of 100 for r hya from stellar phase 0.15 to 0.97 .",
    "previous observations have revealed periodic maser line temperature variations matched to the stellar periods but with a phase lag of @xmath12 periods @xcite . to test for this signal in our data ,",
    "for each star we summed the antenna temperatures in each backend channel over the entire spectral line , normalized the sums to the maximum observered line temperature , and plotted them versus the stellar phase ( figure 1 ) .",
    "for the ensemble , the integrated line temperatures are clearly periodic . a least - squares best - fit sine wave fits the aggregate - normalized maser temperatures well with a phase lag of @xmath13 and an uncertainty @xmath14 , in broad agreement with the previous results , but tending toward a slightly smaller phase shift .",
    "the stokes parameters were calculated for each velocity channel for each observation ( figures 8 through 25 ) : @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( n - s polarized @xmath17 minus e - w polarized @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 ( ne - sw polarized @xmath17 minus nw - se polarized @xmath19 ) , with polarization @xmath20 and position angle @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the normalized stokes parameters and @xmath24 . since we are interested in the long term variability , we averaged the stokes spectra for each star for the multiple observations at each epoch ( separated by no more than a couple of days ) .",
    "the spectra are complex with several line components visible in most of them . in general , the polarizations are dominated by a few highly - polarized components that can be distinguished by their @xmath3 s and @xmath4 s . since our observations beam - average all the masers within each stellar envelope , it is possible that multiple masers contribute to each observed feature at a given velocity .",
    "overlapping features could explain the smooth variations in polarization and position angle ( given by changing relative contributions from @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) across the spectra .",
    "for example , r aqr is dominated by 1 - 3 components that tend to blend together for all the epochs in our survey . in contrast , @xmath25 ceti , vy cma , u her , r leo , and vx sgr have separate line components that can be distinguished even in the absence of polarization information . under the assumption that the masing cells are distributed in a ring - like manner with tangential polarization vectors",
    ", the line blending of multiple components will reduce the observed polarization .",
    "thus , our interpretation of independent masers leads to a lower limit to the actual polarization of independent masing entities .    as a broad characterization of the maser polarization",
    ", we averaged the polarization across the spectral lines for each star for each epoch .",
    "the percentage polarizations are shown as a function of julian day in figure 2 .",
    "the spectrum - averaged polarization varies substantially for most of the stars .",
    "however , stars with high average polarization tended to retain a high polarization : @xmath25 ceti ( @xmath26% , rms @xmath27% ) and s crb ( @xmath28% , rms @xmath29% ) . stars with moderate polarization tended to retain moderate polarization , and stars with low polarization tended to retain low polarization , e.g. , vx sgr ( @xmath30% , rms @xmath31% ; see figure 3 , where @xmath32 for all of the stars ) . the average polarization for all the stars over all the epochs was 23% ( table 1 ) .    to look for evidence of cyclic polarization variation ,",
    "the polarization is plotted in figure 4 versus the stellar phase @xmath33 .",
    "no significant systematic polarization variability is apparent , with the possible exception of a minimum at @xmath34 , approximately corresponding to the peak in maser brightness .",
    "this minimum at @xmath35 is suspect : a single observation of 40% polarization at @xmath35 would make the apparent minimum invisible . the most highly polarized star , @xmath25 ceti was not observed near @xmath34 , and if it had been the visual impression of a minimum likely would be absent",
    ".    a subtle shift in polarization as a function of stellar phase can be tested by binning the polarizations for the ensemble into the high intensity phase ( corresponding to the brightest half of each cycle for sio ; @xmath36 in figures 1 and 4 ) and the low intensity phase ( @xmath37 ) . excluding vy cma , which is aperiodic , and oh2.6 - 0.4 , for which we did not find a single stellar maximum , the average high intensity phase polarization was",
    "23% ( @xmath38% ; standard deviation of the mean ) and the average low intensity phase polarization was 23% ( @xmath39% ; standard deviation of the mean ) .",
    "thus there is no convincing evidence of systematic polarization variability in the high intensity phase compared to the low intensity phase .",
    "the integrated line temperatures were higher during the high intensity phase than during the low intensity phase by an average factor of 1.3 . under the assumption that the masers are distributed on circumstellar rings with tangential polarization vectors",
    ", we can relate the integrated line temperatures and percentage polarizations .",
    "an increased number of masers with a constant average brightness ( leading to the increased high intensity phase brightness ) would tend to decrease the beam - averaged polarizations by a factor of @xmath40 ( in the limit of large @xmath41 ) , where @xmath41 is the number of independent masers .",
    "for a brightness increase of 1.3 , the polarization would be expected to fall by a factor of 1.14 from 23% , during the low intensity phase , to 20% during the high intensity phase ( for @xmath42 ) . since the percentage polarization is actually is equal during both phases at 23% and the @xmath43 uncertainty in the difference is 5% , the interpretation is inconclusive .",
    "the spectra themselves do not show a clear dependence on the number of line polarization features as a function of stellar phase , although polarization spectral features should not be assigned to discrete masers due to the beam averaging .",
    "the spectrum - averaged polarization position angles @xmath44 do not have random distributions for many of the stars in our sample ( figure 5 ) .",
    "this either indicates : 1 ) that there is some long - term ( @xmath45 ) persistence in the masers , or 2 ) if the masers are distributed in circumstellar rings with tangential polarization vectors , that particular regions in the circumstellar envelopes tend to consistently mase most brightly for @xmath45 , or both .",
    "r aqr , vy cma , @xmath25 ceti , and s crb , for example , have position angles that slowly vary around mean values , with position angle dispersions @xmath46 of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "vy cma is dominated by just a few small features that remain coherent for the entire span of our observations .",
    "so , for these stars , even if the discrete masers do not remain coherent for greater than one period , the masing is dominated by one or two ( opposing ) quadrants of the stellar disks . however",
    ", this is not true for all the stars : the mean @xmath51 , indicating that dominant maser coherence is not maintained for @xmath45 in general .      to quantitatively test the prediction that masers are reborn each stellar cycle with the passage of a shock wave , we compared the polarization spectral feature lifetimes , which are assumed to be representative of the maser lifetimes , with the stellar periods . to avoid the ambiguities associated with the decomposition of a continuous spectrum into a discrete sum of spectral components",
    ", we used a statistical method to estimate the feature lifetimes .",
    "in addition to numerical simplicity , this approach takes in account all maser polarization , even from features too small to be individually extracted .",
    "although all maser emission in the spectra contribute to the derived lifetimes , brighter components contribute more than fainter ones .",
    "this technique does not require assigning individual masers to spectral polarization features on a one - to - one basis .    for computational convenience ,",
    "each spectrum was treated as a complex function @xmath52 of velocity , where @xmath53 was the real part and @xmath54 was the imaginary part ( similarly , the polarization could be represented in polar coordinates : @xmath55 ) .",
    "we write the correlation @xmath56 between the spectra of two epochs @xmath57 and @xmath58 , observed at times @xmath59 and @xmath60 , as @xmath61^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] the time between the two observations @xmath57 and @xmath58 is @xmath62 , and the integrals are numerical sums over the spectral lines binned in velocity by the receiver backends .",
    "@xmath63 would be unity for @xmath64 , and one expects the @xmath63 s to become smaller as @xmath65 increases and the masers evolve , come , and go . to estimate an average maser lifetime for a star ,",
    "the width of @xmath66 , @xmath67 distribution for all @xmath68 pairs was fit to a gaussian expectation function @xmath69 with width ( in time ) given by @xmath70 . with this formalism , the width in the correlation function is @xmath71 , and we take the average spectral feature lifetime to be @xmath72 .",
    "the average spectral component lifetime is not the lifetime of a maser , but represents a characteristic time over which the @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectral features persist .",
    "the stars were sampled from one to six times per period ( typically 2 - 3 times per period ) , with an average of 6.4 observations per star over 30 months , and a typical time between observations of 3.75 months .",
    "therefore , lifetimes shorter than a few months or greater than 30 months can not be measured .",
    "the uncertainties in the fits of the correlation distribution to the expectation function were on the order of 1 - 2 weeks , but the systematic errors in applying this technique to poorly sampled data should dominate the uncertainties .",
    "average maser lifetimes derived with this technique range from 85 to 800 days , with the lowest number corresponding well to the minimum time between observations .",
    "the lifetimes are plotted versus the stellar periods in figure 6 ; the stellar periods cluster at just over one year .",
    "long lifetimes were derived for @xmath25 ceti ( 545 days ) and s crb ( 500 days ) .",
    "inspection of their spectra in figures 12 and 14 , respectively , reveals several strong polarization features that persist for many of the observations , even for @xmath73 stellar period .",
    "r leo , with a derived lifetime of 415 days , also exhibits the persistence of some features , enabling a robust lifetime to be derived .",
    "vy cma is aperiodic , and hence does not appear in figure 6 , but does have weak polarization features at @xmath74 km / s that persisted from 1996 march to 1997 october , and one feature at @xmath75 km / s that is present in all the epochs , consistent with the 645 day derived lifetime .",
    "for the majority of the stars in the sample , the characteristic lifetimes are shorter than the stellar periods , indicating that many masers do not survive entire stellar cycles .",
    "the oh - ir stars and supergiants do not seem to differ from the miras in their maser lifetimes .    to summarize",
    ", one rule does not apply to all of the stars : some exhibit maser line features that persist for more than one stellar cycle , while others exhibit masers that do not persist for even a single full cycle . beyond this",
    ", our survey does not have sufficient temporal resolution to determine whether most masers go through a `` reset '' at any particular phase .      in a manner similar to the maser lifetime estimation",
    ", the maser line widths can be estimated in km / s without resorting to fitting multiple line components , which are not well constrained for low - level spectral features .",
    "we derived polarization line feature widths from the autocorrelation function @xmath76 of the polarization spectrum @xmath52 : @xmath77 the @xmath78 closely approximate gaussians : in the limit that the spectrum @xmath52 were the sum of gaussian features of width @xmath70 , the autocorrelation function would be a gaussian of width @xmath79 .",
    "we defined the average velocity dispersion as the dispersion that would produce an autocorrelation function best fitting the observed result @xmath78 .",
    "averaged over the ensemble , the velocity dispersion is 0.52 km @xmath80 .",
    "the range of widths is small , 0.33 to 0.67 km @xmath80 , suggesting that a common physical process leads to an upper limit for the maser velocity - widths , or that blending occurs on this scale due to beam averaging .",
    "figure 7 shows that the maser feature line widths are independent of stellar phase , indicating that coherent masers are not velocity broadened by the stellar winds or pulsations during the stellar cycles .",
    "we monitored the intensity and polarization of sio masers in 17 evolved stars , over 2.5 years , to investigate the relationship between maser variability and stellar phase .",
    "the polarization variability is not uniform throughout the sample .",
    "sustained polarizations of nearly 50% were observed observed in @xmath25 ceti , whereas a sustained polarization of @xmath81% was observed in vx sgr , and the sample - average polarization was 23% with a typical dispersion of 7% . for the ensemble of stars ,",
    "the polarization is not related to stellar phase , with the possible exception of a slight minimum in polarization at @xmath82 .    in the stokes @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra of individual stars ,",
    "a few strong maser features tended to dominate the polarization . in some cases , these masers persisted for several epochs ( @xmath73 stellar cycle ) , and in other cases they evolved much more quickly , with little resemblance between the spectra from subsequent epochs .",
    "we used a statistical technique to quantify the lifetimes of maser line polarization features ( which may not correspond to independent masers in our beam - averaged observations ) for comparison to the stellar periods . for each star",
    ", we measured the correlation between the spectra in all pairs of epochs as a function of the time between the epochs .",
    "this technique has the advantage of incorporating all of the polarization information in the spectra , without having to fit individual line components and trace them from epoch - to - epoch . for regular variable stars",
    ", we found that the characteristic maser lifetimes ranged from a few months ( the minimum lifetime that could be measured ) to 800 days .",
    "these data indicate that the masers are not reset by the passage of shocks every stellar cycle from stellar pulsations for some of the stars , and that the maser lifetimes are often shorter than the stellar periods for others .",
    "we also found a long - term persistence in the spectrum - averaged polarization position angles for some of the stars .",
    "this is in broad agreement with the persistence of individual masers , or a preference for masing in single or opposing quadrants of the stellar disks ( assuming ring - like distributions of masers with tangential polarizations ) . finally , the widths of the maser line components in the spectra ranged from @xmath83 km / s , with no dependence on stellar phase .",
    "we thank the aavso international database and its observers worldwide for the dates of stellar maxima .",
    "we thank phil maloney for helpful discussions and chris walker for contributions to the design of the polarimeter .",
