    "<S> vortex dipoles are generated when an obstacle moves through a superfluid . in case of phase - separated binary condensates , with appropriate interaction parameters in pan - cake shaped traps </S>",
    "<S> , we show that coreless vortex dipoles are created when a gaussian obstacle beam traverses across them above a critical speed . </S>",
    "<S> as the obstacle passes through the inner component , it carries along a bubble of the outer component . using thomas - fermi approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we show that phase - separated binary condensates can either support vortices with empty or filled cores . for time dependent obstacle potentials , ramped down in the present case , relative energy scales of the system influence the dynamical evolution of the binary condensate .    </S>",
    "<S> vortices are among the most fundamental topological structures in fluid flows . </S>",
    "<S> these occur in a variety of fluids at different length scales and in different settings . in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , vortices carry integral angular momenta and serve as evidence of superfluidity . formation and dynamics of solitary and multiple vortices in single species condensates </S>",
    "<S> is well studied . these vortices with empty cores and a phase singularity at the center of the cores are _ normal vortices _ , whose analogues are found in variety of other fluids . </S>",
    "<S> an important development in vortex dynamics is the realization of vortex dipoles , a pair of vortex and anti - vortex , due to superfluid flow past an obstacle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the recent development to observe vortex dipoles in real time @xcite opens up the possibility to examine dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex dipoles can also be considered as the embedded section of a vortex ring , which were first observed in bec as decay product of dark solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another phenomenon in superfluids , where vortex dipoles are crucial is transition to quantum turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the initial requirement is the formation of multiple vortex dipoles , followed by reconnections to form a vortex tangle , which then leads to quantum turbulence @xcite . in multi - component condensates , coreless vortices </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and skyrmions @xcite have been experimentally observed in spinor condensates . </S>",
    "<S> coreless vortices in multi - component spinless condensates are , however , yet to be experimentally realized .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , the flow of the miscible binary and spinor condensates across a gaussian obstacle potential has been investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a related work is the seeding of vortex rings when a condensate bubble moves through the bulk of another condensate in binary condensates . </S>",
    "<S> this is examined in a recent work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , phase - separated binary condensates , under suitable conditions , are appropriate systems to observe phenomena related to dynamical instabilities . these include , modulational instability @xcite , kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite , rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite , countersuperflow instability @xcite and richtmyer - meshkov instability @xcite . among these , </S>",
    "<S> the countersuperflow instability was recently realized experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> phase separation , which has been observed experimentally @xcite , is also a necessary condition to observe coreless vortex dipoles with a moving obstacle .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report the theoretical study of vortex dipole formation when a gaussian obstacle moves through phase - separated binary condensates . as a specific case </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the binary condensate consisting of @xmath0rb and @xmath1rb . in this , </S>",
    "<S> one of the scattering lengths can be tuned by using magnetic feshbach resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to choose values of scattering lengths suitable for generation of coreless vortex dipoles . </S>"
