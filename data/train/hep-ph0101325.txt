    "a study of the @xmath0 polarization in ( anti)neutrino nucleon dis is motivated by several reasons . first , a possible longitudinal polarization in the _ target fragmentation region _ can be related to the polarized nucleon strangeness which is a conclusion ( in the framework of quark parton model assuming @xmath7 symmetry and vanishing gluon spin contribution to the nucleon spin ) of dis experiments with both polarized beam and target  @xcite .",
    "the authors  @xcite attempt to explain the negative sign of the nucleon strangeness and predict that it could manifest itself as a _ negative _ ( aligned in the opposite direction to the @xmath2 exchange boson ) longitudinal polarization of @xmath0 hyperons produced in ( anti)neutrino nucleon dis .",
    "second , a measurement of the longitudinal polarization in the _ current fragementation region _ provides a test of different models for the @xmath0 spin structure  @xcite with a _",
    "clean flavour separation _ provided by the nature of neutrino interactions .",
    "last but not least , transverse polarization of @xmath0 hyperons has been observed for a long time in unpolarized hadron - hadron experiments  @xcite , and was never observed in ( anti)neutrino nucleon dis experiments  @xcite .",
    "this surprizing feature challenges experimental and theoretical efforts in this field .",
    "the neutrino nucleon dis is again exceptional due to the different @xmath0 production mechanisms in the target and current fragmentation regions in contrast to @xmath8 scattering .",
    "the quark and di - quark fragmentations are believed to be the subject of the current and target fragmentation regions respectively . therefore , it is possible to study the transverse polarization in connection with the different mechanisms of @xmath0 production .",
    "the active part of the nomad detector consists of 44 drift chambers located in a @xmath9 tesla magnetic field .",
    "the drift chambers serve as a nearly isoscalar target for neutrino interactions and as a tracking medium .",
    "these drift chambers provide an overall efficiency for charged track reconstruction of better than 95% and a momentum resolution of approximately 3.5% in the momentum range of interest ( less than 10  @xmath10 ) .",
    "reconstructed tracks are used to determine the event topology ( the assignment of tracks to vertices ) , to reconstruct the vertex position and the track parameters at each vertex and , finally , to identify the vertex type ( primary , secondary , v@xmath11 , etc . ) .",
    "@xmath0 hyperons appear in the detector as two charged tracks with opposite charges emerging from a common vertex separated from the primary interaction vertex ( v@xmath11 -like signature ) .",
    "these events correspond to @xmath12 decay .",
    "the background to @xmath0 decays consists of k@xmath13 , @xmath14 decays , @xmath15 conversions , and random combinations of tracks wrongly labeled as v@xmath11s . to identify @xmath0 hyperons",
    "we first apply some quality cuts to reject as much as possible of the combinatorial background , @xmath16-conversions , and secondary interactions , we then perform a kinematic fit with energy and momentum constraints for each v@xmath11 for the final resolution of v@xmath11-like particles . as a result we obtained 8087 reconstructed and identified @xmath0 hyperons with about @xmath17 background contamination in our data sample  @xcite .",
    "this sample is used for the polarization analysis reported below .",
    "the @xmath0 polarization is measured through the _ asymmetry _ in the angular distribution of the protons in the parity violating decay process @xmath12 . in the @xmath0 rest frame",
    "the decay protons are distributed as : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath0 polarization vector , @xmath20  @xcite is the decay asymmetry parameter and @xmath21 is the unit vector along the decay proton direction .",
    "a fit of the raw angular distributions of the decay protons in the data can only be performed after correction for the detector acceptance . to take into account the detector acceptance , and smearing of the angular distributions we developed a new 3-dimensional method for the polarization analysis  @xcite .",
    "we used its 1-dimensional option for the results reported below because of its better applicability to the samples with low statistics as is the case in the study of the polarization dependence on different kinematic variables .",
    "the axes are defined as follows ( in the @xmath0 rest frame ) :    * @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the reconstructed @xmath2-boson direction ; * latexmath:[$\\mathbf n_y = \\mathbf e_w \\times \\mathbf e_{t } /    @xmath0 production plane * @xmath25 .",
    "table  [ tab : general ] displays the results for the polarization of @xmath0 hyperons in our sample as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "we observe negative longitudinal ( `` @xmath27 '' ) and transverse ( `` @xmath6 '' ) polarizations of @xmath0 s which are enhanced in the target fragmentation region .",
    "note that transverse polarization has never been observed before in ( anti)neutrino nucleon dis experiments .",
    "it is believed that the origin of @xmath0 polarization is different in the target and in the current fragmentation regions",
    ". therefore it can be useful to study @xmath0 polarization at @xmath28 and @xmath29 separately .    .[tab",
    ": general ] _ dependence of the @xmath0 polarization on @xmath26 in @xmath1 cc events ( statistical errors only ) .",
