    "percolation@xcite describes the passage of an influence through a medium which is irregularly structured in the sense that the influence can propagate through some regions whereas it can not pass other areas .",
    "prominent examples for such media are computer networks like the internet where information propagates and irregularity can be caused by random switch failures or other technical problems .",
    "a particularly simple percolation model is the random resistor network ( rrn ) . in this model",
    "the irregular medium is given by a , say hypercubic , lattice in which bonds between nearest neighboring sites are randomly occupied with a probability @xmath4 .",
    "the influence corresponds to an external current @xmath5 , which is injected at a terminal site @xmath6 and withdrawn at another terminal site @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the occupation probability @xmath4 the resistors ( bonds ) are likely to either be isolated or to form clusters .",
    "two sites belong to the same cluster if they are connected by a path of bonds and hence current can flow between them . at low @xmath4 two infinitely separated terminal sites @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 are not connected by such a path and the network behaves as an insulator . for large @xmath4 , on the other hand , many paths between @xmath6 and @xmath7 may exist and the network is a conductor .",
    "therefore , at some probability in between , a threshold @xmath8 must exist where for the first time current can percolate from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the threshold probability is called the percolation threshold .",
    "since it separates the conducting and the insulating phase , it is also referred to as the critical probability . in rrns",
    "the influence can percolate through occupied bonds in all directions .",
    "the resulting clusters are typically isotropic in space .",
    "this kind of percolation is referred to as isotropic percolation ( ip ) .",
    "the linear extend of the isotropic clusters can be characterized by the correlation length @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the correlation length exponent of the ip universality class .",
    "directed percolation ( dp)@xcite is an anisotropic variant of percolation .",
    "the bonds function as diodes so that the current can percolate only along a given distinguished direction .",
    "the critical properties of isotropic and directed percolation are very different .",
    "typical dp clusters are anisotropic and they are characterized by two different correlation lengths : @xmath11 ( parallel to the distinguished direction ) and @xmath12 ( perpendicular to it ) . as one approaches the critical probability ,",
    "the two correlation lengths diverge with the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the dp universality class .",
    "the apparent success of dp might be attributed to the fact that it is perhaps the simplest model resulting in branching self - affine objects .",
    "it has many potential applications , including fluid flow through porous media under gravity , hopping conductivity in a strong electric field@xcite , crack propagation@xcite , and the propagation of surfaces at depinning transitions@xcite .",
    "dp has a dynamic interpretation in which the distinguished direction is viewed as time .",
    "a dp cluster then represents the history of a stochastic process . in this dynamic interpretation",
    "the dp universality class is the generic universality class for phase transitions from an active to an absorbing inactive state .",
    "for example the epidemic spreading of an infectious desease without immunization@xcite may be described by dp@xcite .",
    "moreover , dp is related to self - organized critical models  @xcite .    in the early 1980 s redner introduced the random resistor diode network ( rdn ) which comprises both , ip and dp .",
    "a rdn is a bond percolation model where nearest - neighbor sites are connected by a resistor , a positive diode ( conducting only in the distinguished direction ) , a negative diode ( conducting only opposite to the distinguished direction ) , or an insulator with respective probabilities @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . in the three dimensional phase diagram ( pictured as a tetrahedron spanned by the four probabilities )",
    "one finds a nonpercolating and three percolating phases .",
    "the percolating phases are isotropic , positively directed , or negatively directed . between the phases there are surfaces of continuous transitions .",
    "all four phases meet along a multicritical line , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 . on the entire multicritical line ,",
    "i.e. , independently of @xmath2 , one finds the scaling properties of usual isotropic percolation ( @xmath20 ) . for the crossover from ip to dp see , e.g. , ref.@xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus exclusively on the vicinity of the critical surface separating the non - percolating and the positively directed phase .",
    "an important notion in the theory of rdn is the average resistance @xmath21 between two connected terminal sites @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the network .",
    "the critical behavior of this average resistance is well known@xcite .",
    "if @xmath21 is measured for example in the distinguished , timelike direction then it scales like @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the dp resistance exponent . here in this paper",
    "we consider a generalized rdn in which the resistor - like bonds and the diode - like bonds under forward bias voltage obey a generalized ohm s law , @xmath0 . our motivation to assume this non linear ohm s law is twofold .",
    "first , real circuit elements have non linear current - voltage characteristics .",
    "this is obviously the case for diodes but it also applies to a certain extend to resistors , in particular for large currents .",
    "our main motivation is , however , that the generalized average resistance @xmath26 is related for certain values of @xmath2 to important fractal substructures of dp clusters .",
    "this relation provides us with an elegant way to determine the fractal dimensions of the red bonds , the chemical path , and the dp backbone .",
