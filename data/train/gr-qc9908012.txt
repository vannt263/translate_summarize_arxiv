    "finite difference numerical simulations of axisymmetric systems are most often , and most naturally , carried out in coordinate systems adapted to the symmetry of the underlying problem , polar spherical @xmath6 or cylindrical @xmath7 coordinates .",
    "however , the use of such coordinate systems brings with it delicate problems in finite differencing near the @xmath1  axis , particularly when _ tensor _ time - evolution partial differential equations ( pdes ) are considered . depending on the problem , it is often very difficult to obtain fully stable numerical evolutions near the axis , and for some problems it is difficult to even accurately discretize the equations there .",
    "here we consider the problem for the einstein equations of general relativity in axisymmetry , although our approach should be useful for other systems of pdes (  the navier - stokes equations ) , and also for the case of spherical symmetry .",
    "there are several different types of @xmath1  axis difficulties , which depending on the physical system may occur singly or in combination .",
    "the simplest problem is that physically nonsingular terms in the equations may have indeterminate @xmath8 forms along the @xmath1  axis .",
    "fortunately , such terms are generally easy to regularize by applying lhopital s rule .",
    "for example , in polar spherical coordinates @xmath6 , the flat - space laplacian operator includes the term @xmath9 assuming all fields to be smooth on the @xmath1  axis and applying lhopital s rule , the @xmath10 limit of this term is easily seen to be @xmath11    however , even here there may be a problem with finite differencing : although the @xmath10 limit of the term   is precisely  , when we finite difference these terms the limiting relationship generally only holds in the limit where the grid spacing @xmath12 . for any given ( nonzero ) @xmath13 , the numerically computed values of   will have a @xmath10 limit which will in general differ somewhat from the numerical values of  .",
    "this difference may give rise to finite differencing instabilities near the axis .",
    "a more serious @xmath1  axis problem is that of @xmath14 cancellations , where a physically nonsingular quantity is computed as the sum of many terms , two or more of which are individually singular on the @xmath1  axis .",
    "for example , again using polar spherical coordinates , @xmath6 , in the so - called `` @xmath0 '' einstein equations ( @xcite ; see , for example , @xcite for general reviews ) , the 3-ricci tensor component @xmath15 is generically @xmath16 on the @xmath1  axis , but it is computed as the sum of , among ( many ) other terms , @xmath17 , which is generically @xmath18 near the @xmath1  axis .",
    "although not impossible , regularizing terms of this nature is very difficult , requiring a detailed analysis of the generic behavior of the entire system of pdes under consideration ( for our example , the coupled @xmath0 evolution of einstein s equations , with constraint and coordinate equations ) near the @xmath1  axis .",
    "collectively these problems can be very severe , crippling attempts to evolve systems with such symmetries ( see ,  @xcite ) .",
    "many solutions to the problems brought on by special coordinate systems have been attempted , including various regularization procedures  @xcite , taylor expansions  @xcite , the use of nonsingular - basis tensor components  @xcite , spectral methods  @xcite , and special coordinate conditions used to eliminate troublesome terms  @xcite . however , these methods tend to be complicated and not particularly robust .",
    "on the other hand , 3d  cartesian coordinates contain no coordinate pathologies , and all terms in the equations governing the evolution of functions are typically completely regular , even at special points such as the origin or along a symmetry axis  @xcite .",
    "normally , however , if one treats a spherical or axisymmetric system in 3d cartesian coordinates one loses the ability to ignore irrelevant dimensions .",
    "for example , a spherically symmetric system should reduce to a 1d problem , depending only on the radius @xmath19 , while an axisymmetric system reduces to a 2d problem , independent of the azimuthal coordinate @xmath20 . in full",
    "3d  cartesian coordinates , not only is the true symmetry of the problem potentially disturbed by the finite differences taken in a cartesian coordinate system , but dimensional reductions do not occur , and the memory requirements are much larger , scaling as @xmath21 , rather than as @xmath22 or @xmath23 . for reasonable grid sizes of order hundreds of zones , these factors can become astronomical .",
    "in 3d numerical relativity , the problem is exacerbated by the need to carry a large number of 3d grid functions ( typically over 100 ) in memory at all times .",
    "some savings have been realized in cases where cartesian coordinates are used for intrinsically axisymmetric or spherical problems by evolving only a single octant , reducing memory and computational requirements by a factor of eight , but this does not change the overall scaling with @xmath23 .    furthermore , while many problems are now treatable in 3d , where cartesian coordinates are generally favored , testbeds for developing algorithms for the full 3d case are often carried out in lower dimensional cases , where the problems are simpler and where limiting solutions are known . however , working in special coordinate systems for lower dimensional test problems introduces difficulties specific to the coordinate system , and frequently techniques developed in special coordinate system do not carry over to the 3d  cartesian code .",
    "what is needed is a lower dimensional testbed that retains the same essential features present in the generic 3d case , at both the physical and computational level .    in this paper",
    "we describe a scheme which borrows from the singularity - free nature of full 3d  cartesian coordinates , and allows the treatment of axisymmetric and spherically symmetric problems without the memory constraints of full 3d  cartesian coordinates .",
    "take the case of axisymmetry : the essential trick is to realize that in 3d  cartesian coordinates , an axisymmetric system can be computed in , say , the @xmath24-@xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) plane alone .",
    "the @xmath24-@xmath1 system can be rotated about the @xmath1  axis to determine the solution at any @xmath2  point at a given instant of time .",
    "however , a 3d evolution also requires spatial derivatives in the @xmath4  direction , which ( for non - scalar field variables ) do not necessarily all vanish , even in the @xmath24-@xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) plane . because of the axisymmetry assumption",
    ", the solution in the @xmath24-@xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) plane can be rotated according to tensor transformation laws to any @xmath4  value , so the @xmath4  derivatives of all quantities can be determined in the @xmath24-@xmath1 plane solely from information in this same plane . hence , a full 3d  evolution in cartesian coordinates can be carried out , using _ only _ information from a single 2d  plane of data .",
    "there are different ways to achieve this , as we show in the sections below , but the key point is that an axisymmetric or spherical system can be evolved _ as if it were in 3d  cartesian coordinates _ , and hence without coordinate singularities and the instabilities they can induce , and without going to the expense of a full 3d computation .    in section  [ sec : technique ]",
    "we describe the technique in detail for the case of axisymmetry .",
    "we show the effectiveness of the method in applications to dynamic wave and black hole spacetimes in section  [ sec : apps ] , and summarize the work in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the method has been fully implemented under the name ( chosen because of its resemblance to the way low - budget television cartoons animate a nominally 3-dimensional world in `` @xmath25 ''  dimensions , and also as a shorthand for _ car_tesian _",
    "two_-dimensional ) in the cactus code for numerical relativity and astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "in 3d systems with _ discrete _ symmetries it has been common practice to evolve just a part of the domain , and use symmetries to provide boundary conditions .",
    "for example , spherical , axisymmetric , and even 3d systems have been evolved in numerical relativity in a single octant , if the symmetries of the system allow it .",
    "a spherical system is reflection symmetric about all coordinate planes , and hence it could be evolved in cartesian coordinates in the octant defined by , say , @xmath26 all non - negative .",
    "any planar reflection symmetry can be used to provide boundary conditions at the plane of reflection ,  from the symmetry one can infer that certain functions are either symmetric or antisymmetric across the coordinate planes . this has been used in many simulations in numerical relativity .    in what follows",
    "we discuss how in the case of axisymmetry one can use the _ continuous _ rotational symmetry to provide boundary conditions for a thin 3d slab .",
    "the same construction is expected to be applicable to spherically symmetric systems .",
    "consider a rectangular three dimensional volume in @xmath27 , with cartesian coordinates @xmath2 .",
    "we assume a uniformly spaced cartesian grid with spacings @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , and we take the finite difference molecules to have radii  @xmath31 in the @xmath24  direction and @xmath32  in the @xmath4  direction .",
    "( for reasons discussed in section  [ sec : interpolation ] , we will typically have @xmath33 . )",
    "we take the @xmath1  axis to be the axis of symmetry , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slab ] . in the @xmath4  direction ,",
    "the grid contains @xmath34 points centered about @xmath35 .",
    "( for example , for standard second order centered difference @xmath36 , and there are points at @xmath35 and @xmath37 . ) in the @xmath24  direction , the grid starts near the axis at @xmath38 and extends out to some finite positive @xmath39 .",
    "we consider the two cases @xmath40 ( staggered ) and @xmath41 ( non - staggered ) .",
    "one can compute finite differences with a centered cartesian 3d molecule in the interior plane of the slab ,  for all grid points at @xmath42 and @xmath35 , once boundary values are specified .",
    "the boundary values in the @xmath1  direction and the positive @xmath24  direction are assumed to be given as part of the general problem . as outlined above , the key point in the case of axisymmetry",
    "is that field values at points with @xmath43 , and also at the points with @xmath44 , can be obtained through a rotation and interpolation from field values on the half plane @xmath45 and @xmath3 .",
    "let us first discuss the rotation of the tensors and non - tensors that arise in typical numerical relativity computations .",
    "the basic formula , eq .",
    "( [ basicrot ] ) below , is ( aside from a few subtleties in its derivation ) precisely what one expects for a vector in @xmath27 in cartesian coordinates .",
    "consider the rotation of a tensor field by an angle @xmath46 about the @xmath1 axis .",
    "equivalently , we can view this as keeping the field fixed , but rotating the _ coordinates _ in the _ opposite _ direction , rotating them by @xmath47 . taking this latter viewpoint , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath48 that are adapted to the rotation about the @xmath1  axis ,",
    "the rotated coordinates are @xmath49 or in the cartesian coordinates given by @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 this coordinate transformation gives rise to the linear map @xmath53 note that @xmath54 .",
    "now consider arbitrary tensor fields @xmath55 on a three - dimensional manifold @xmath56 . without referring to coordinates , a rotation",
    "( if it exists ) defines a diffeomorphism @xmath57 , mapping points to points , and as such also defines a new tensor field @xmath58 of the same contra- and covariant type as @xmath55 .",
    "the diffeomorphism @xmath59 is a symmetry transformation for the tensor field @xmath55 if @xmath60 .",
    "we assume , as is often the case in numerical relativity , that the domain of interest is covered by a single coordinate chart .",
    "the matrix of components of @xmath61 in the coordinate bases of the coordinate system @xmath62 at a point @xmath63 and the coordinate system @xmath64 at the point @xmath65 equals the jacobian matrix of the map @xmath59 between the coordinates , which is given in  , if we assume coordinates adapted to the rotation .",
    "the components of a tensor @xmath55 at @xmath63 , for example @xmath66 , transform according to @xmath67 in the case of axisymmetry ( @xmath68 ) we therefore arrive at @xmath69 where @xmath59 is given by   with @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "for example , for a vector @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "equation   describes how to compute the values of a tensor at points outside the half - plane @xmath42 and @xmath5 from points within this plane .",
    "one type of non - tensor that is often used in numerical relativity is the partial derivative of tensors , @xmath75 . under coordinate transformations",
    ", the index @xmath76 transforms by the chain rule of partial derivatives with the same jacobian factor as appears in the coordinate transformation of a tensor ,  . using   and the product rule",
    ", there appear additional terms containing @xmath77 .",
    "however , using coordinates that are adapted to the axisymmetry   implies @xmath78 ( in other words , @xmath59 describes a rigid rotation ) , and hence the basic transformation law   is also valid for partial derivatives of tensors in this context .",
    "we now turn to a brief discussion of the necessary interpolations .",
    "as made explicit in  , we require fields at points @xmath79 .",
    "as such points are not necessarily part of the numerical grid , a one - dimensional interpolation may be required . in this work",
    "we test lagrange polynomial interpolation (  @xcite ) with interpolation polynomials of degrees  2 through  5 , obtaining good results already with second order polynomials .",
    "our evolution code uses second order finite difference molecules of size  @xmath80 , but for interpolation polynomials of degree larger than  2 we need @xmath81 .",
    "note that even the points at @xmath82 , @xmath5 can be obtained through interpolation by first applying the physical boundary for @xmath35 , then rotating to @xmath83 for @xmath84 , and then applying the physical boundary at @xmath85 , @xmath83 .",
    "this sort of interpolation is used in many areas of computational science (  in adaptive mesh refinement ) , and thus should not be expected to pose a serious threat to the success of this technique .",
    "the principal issue of concern is whether interpolation might destabilize an evolution scheme that often is carefully crafted using particular forms of centered stencils and averages .",
    "this must be addressed on a case - by - case basis , either by von  neumann or other analytical stability analysis , and/or by numerical experiment .",
    "although we do not do it in practice , instead of explicitly computing and storing field values at the boundaries in the @xmath4  direction , one can make the polynomial interpolation a part of the stencil , thereby explicitly reducing the 3d stencil to an inhomogeneous and asymmetric  but nonsingular ",
    "2d stencil .",
    "in contrast , storing field values for a 3d stencil allows us to simply use numerical routines from existing cartesian 3d codes .",
    "in this section we provide two important tests , both with the complete set of 3d , nonlinear einstein evolution equations , performed with `` cartoon '' in the cactus code for numerical relativity  @xcite . however , we stress that the techniques developed here are applicable to many families of partial differential equations . that our tests are so successful , with such a complicated set of tensor pdes as the @xmath0 einstein equations involving dozens of coupled nonlinear evolution equations , stresses this point .",
    "simpler sets of equations can be expected to have fewer complications : less severe regularity issues at symmetry points ( origin or axis ) , simpler transformation laws in the rotation to provide boundary conditions , etc .      in this section",
    "we give a brief introduction to the basic equations we will be solving .",
    "the einstein equations of general relativity in 3 + 1 form ( see @xcite for recent reviews and further references ) are a complicated set of coupled , nonlinear partial differential equations for the symmetric tensor fields @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( indices range from @xmath88 through  @xmath89 , so there are 12  field variables in all ) .",
    "the metric @xmath86 is the spatial part of the spacetime metric ( which gives the invariant distance between two infinitesimally separated events ) : @xmath90 the extrinsic curvature , @xmath87 , specifies how the @xmath91 slices are embedded in spacetime .",
    "the equations also involve the auxiliary tensor fields @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these so - called `` gauge '' fields carry no dynamical information : they may be freely chosen for convenience .",
    "the lapse function @xmath92 determines the proper time @xmath94 measured by an observer falling normal to the time slice defined by @xmath95 .",
    "the shift vector @xmath96 determines the coordinate distance a constant - coordinate point moves away from the normal vector to the slice as one advances from one slice to the next . in the tests performed in this paper , we choose @xmath97 for simplicity .",
    "the evolution equations can be written as :    [ eqn : evolution ] @xmath98 @xmath99 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\beta^k d_k k_{ij } + k_{ik } d_j \\beta^k + k_{jk } d_i \\beta^k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in these equations @xmath100 is the 3-ricci tensor , @xmath59 is the 3-scalar curvature ( both nonlinear functions of the metric @xmath86 and its first and second spatial derivatives ) , @xmath101 is the trace of @xmath87 , and @xmath102 is the covariant derivative associated with the 3-metric @xmath86 . with suitable choices for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , equations   are hyperbolic in @xmath86 and @xmath87 .    the fields @xmath86 and @xmath87 are not completely freely specifiable : on each @xmath91 slice they must satisfy the four constraint equations    [ eqn : constraints ] @xmath103 @xmath104    where for later use we define the left hand side functions as @xmath105 ( known as the hamiltonian constraint ) and @xmath106 .",
    "are elliptic equations in @xmath86 and @xmath87 ; in general they must be solved numerically in order to obtain valid initial data ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , one can show that once the constraints are satisfied on an initial slice , they are preserved by the evolution equation   ( they stay satisfied for all future times ) .",
    "this statement holds for the continuum equations   and  ; a finite difference evolution will in general only approximately satisfy the constraints at later times ( @xcite ) , and in fact the deviations of @xmath105 and @xmath106 from zero are useful diagnostics of the evolution s numerical accuracy .    to understand the physical meaning of these equations it is useful to consider an analogy with maxwell s equations in a vacuum : @xmath86 and @xmath87 are analogous to the ( vector ) electric and magnetic fields @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the evolution equations   are analogous to the maxwell equations @xmath109 and @xmath110 , and the constraint equations   are analogous to the maxwell equations @xmath111 , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 analogous to @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "however , unlike maxwell s equations , the einstein equations are nonlinear , quite complicated ( they have on the order of 1000  terms when written out in scalar form in terms of coordinate partial derivatives ) , and second order in space ( though still first order in time ) .",
    "these properties make the einstein equations difficult to treat numerically",
    ".    as the main point of our paper is a technique for solving _ any _ set of evolution equations , we simply state that the particular form of the equations we use for this paper is a variant of   and   recently put forth by baumgarte and shapiro  @xcite , based on previous work of shibata and nakamura  @xcite",
    ". we will refer to this as the bssn formulation .",
    "it is to be noted that this formulation is quite similar in many respects to the bona - mass formulation  @xcite . in another paper  @xcite we detail experiments carried out with these formulations on various spacetimes . as these details are not important to the results presented here , in this paper we focus only on the technique and its application to a very general class of partial differential equations , as represented by the einstein equations .",
    "in this section we report on the application of the cartoon technique to the nonlinear evolution of black holes in the strong field regime . to illustrate the power of this technique , we focus on the case of a schwarzschild black hole evolved with geodesic slicing .",
    "geodesically sliced black hole evolutions have been used extensively to test black hole codes in 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite in polar - spherical type coordinates , and in 3d  cartesian coordinates  @xcite .",
    "this black hole case has the advantages of ( i ) having an analytic and also a highly accurate numerical 1d solution ; ( ii ) providing a demanding test , as the slicing rapidly approaches the spacetime singularity , and hence spacetime curvature and metric functions grow rapidly and without bound until the code crashes at time @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the mass of the black hole ; ( iii ) being one of the simpler testbeds in strong field regimes , as the geodesic slicing condition ( @xmath116 ) does not involve coupling additional elliptic or parabolic equations , which could complicate the demonstration of the technique . in the following section we consider a more complex system as a further test of the cartoon method .",
    "the initial 3-metric for the schwarzschild black hole is given by @xmath117 where the conformal factor is @xmath118 .",
    "here @xmath19 is the isotropic radius , related to the standard schwarzschild radius @xmath119 by @xmath120 .",
    "transforming to cartesian coordinates , we have @xmath121 where the cartesian coordinates @xmath24 , @xmath4 , and @xmath1 are related to the isotropic radius @xmath19 in the usual way . the extrinsic curvature for the time symmetric , @xmath122 slice of this spacetime vanishes .",
    "we evolve this black hole in cartesian coordinates , using the cartoon technique . while typical 3d simulations of the einstein equations are currently limited to grid sizes of roughly @xmath123 ( ignoring the possibility of mesh refinements  @xcite ) , and the largest production simulations are currently at around @xmath124  @xcite on a 128gbyte sgi / cray origin  2000 supercomputer with 256 processors , in this simulation we compute the evolution on a grid of @xmath125 .",
    "( our current implementation of the technique requires the @xmath1  direction to range from @xmath126 to @xmath127 . )",
    "this is equivalent to a full 3d calculation of @xmath128 , over two orders of magnitude larger than the largest production simulations to date . yet with this technique , the calculation requires only  0.07% of the memory required to do the full 3d simulation , and was run on 8  processors of an origin  2000 over a period of 40  hours .    in more detail , the present calculation was performed for a unit mass black hole , with @xmath129 , utilizing an iterative - crank - nicholson ( icn ) method of lines evolution scheme with three iterations , a time step @xmath130 , and 4th  order lagrange",
    "polynomial interpolation for the cartoon algorithm .",
    "the total number of time steps for such a simulation was 3000 ( 9000 icn iterations ) , corresponding to a time of @xmath131 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : geodesic1 ] we show the metric function @xmath132 on the @xmath24  axis at selected times during the evolution .",
    "there is no hint of any instability in the result . at @xmath133 , a rather small difference between the numeric and analytic result ( cmp .",
    "@xcite ) can be seen at the peak of @xmath132 . at @xmath133",
    "we also show @xmath134 on the @xmath1  axis , which at this scale is indistinguishable from the numerical @xmath132 on the @xmath24  axis , as it should be for this spherically symmetric data . the @xmath1  direction is computed quite differently from the @xmath24  direction , and suffers from the maximal inhomogeneity of the cartoon stencil due to the interpolation near the @xmath1  axis .",
    "yet results along the @xmath1-axis remain accurate and stable until the end of the simulation , giving a strong indication of the robustness of the technique .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : geodesic2 ] we demonstrate second order convergence of the cartoon evolution .",
    "we use the hamiltonian constraint  @xmath105 as a diagnostic of the evolution s numerical accuracy : since @xmath105 vanishes analytically , it should converge to zero as the grid resolution increases . in particular , for second order finite differencing , each time the grid resolution is doubled @xmath105 should shrink by a factor of  4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the figure shows the maximum value of @xmath105 in the grid as a function of time , plotted for the 3  different grid resolutions @xmath135 , with each successive plot divided by @xmath136 respectively , so the values should be identical at the different resolutions .",
    "second order convergence is directly evident from the figure .",
    "it is to be noted that not only is such a simulation impossible today in full 3d due to memory constraints , but the 2d cartoon run has far higher resolution than has been achieved even in 2d codes designed to treat similar problems .",
    "axisymmetric simulations of black holes , usually performed in spherical - polar coordinates , are typically not performed with more than 300 radial and 50 angular zones  @xcite .",
    "inherent axis instabilities usually create difficulties in simulations with higher resolution than this , in part because angular zones closer to the axis have more delicate regularity behavior to enforce .",
    "it is precisely these sorts of problems cartoon is designed to overcome .",
    "the problem with standard axisymmetric codes are exacerbated unless certain gauges are used that force troublesome terms in the three  metric to vanish .",
    "for example , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a vicious axis instability arose in simulations of spherical or distorted black holes in axisymmetry , causing a rapid code crash , until a gauge condition was developed that diagonalized the three  metric .",
    "this condition required the solution of an elliptic equation to determine @xmath93 at each time step , which is very time consuming to solve numerically . furthermore , even with this gauge choice , if the code is run with too high a resolution , axis instabilities are again encountered , and these instabilities eventually crash the code at late times .",
    "similar problems with axis instabilities have been encountered in the case of rotating  @xcite and colliding black holes  .    as reported recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , a case similar to the one presented here , a geodesically sliced perturbed black hole , was studied to compare results from a 3d code in cartesian coordinates to a traditional 2d axisymmetric code . in order to compare metric functions directly , the codes had to be run with the same spatial gauge , which had vanishing shift .",
    "although the agreement was excellent for as long as it could be computed , due to the axis instability the axisymmetric code crashed far earlier than the time at which the slice hit the singularity . on the other hand ,",
    "the 3d cartesian code , due to its lack of coordinate singularities , was able to run accurately all the way to the singularity . with our cartoon technique , we are able to do the same simulation in cartesian coordinates , with the same accuracy and stability , but with far less memory than is required in full 3d , and with far more stability than is possible in a standard axisymmetric code .",
    "while the above simulation of time slices approaching a black hole singularity provide a strong test of the techniques we have developed , the underlying system is spherically symmetric , and does not contain gravitational waves . in order to further test and confirm this technique",
    ", we now turn to a completely different spacetime system , one not initially containing no black hole . instead , the system we choose is that of highly nonlinear gravitational waves .",
    "gravitational waves are often considered in the linearized regime , where they are small disturbances on some background ( often flat ) spacetime that propagate at the speed of light . however , as the einstein equations are nonlinear , for cases where the waves have sufficiently large amplitude they can affect the background spacetime on which they propagate .",
    "even more , for strong enough waves there is no background spacetime ; the waves have to be treated fully nonlinearly , and under extreme conditions they can even collapse in on themselves , forming a black hole when none existed previously .",
    "low amplitude gravitational waves have provided testbeds of 3d numerical relativity codes for the last decade , and even there they have provided a strong challenge  @xcite .",
    "extreme gravitational wave simulations , where the waves form their own background , and where they may actually form black holes , have only been possible to evolve in full 3d codes during the last year  @xcite . for waves above a certain critical amplitude a black hole forms ,",
    "while for waves just below critical a rich pattern of oscillations develops as the waves teeter on the edge of forming a black hole , and then eventually they disperse and the system returns to flat space ( in a highly nontrivial coordinate system ) .",
    "in this paper we use one such simulation to illustrate the strength of the cartoon technique , and compare with a full 3d simulation as a measure of its accuracy . as our main purpose here",
    "is to demonstrate that the technique is robust , even under very demanding simulations , we will not go into detail of the physics of these simulations .",
    "the interested reader is asked to consult ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .    as in ref .",

    "[ fig : wave1 ] , as a sensitive measure of the evolution we show the minimum value of the lapse function @xmath92 as a function of time throughout the evolution .",
    "we have found this to be a good indicator of the evolution of the system  @xcite , and also , as it sits on the axis and origin of the system , it should be especially sensitive to any problems that arise during the evolution due to the cartoon procedure .",
    "we show results for 3d , and for cartoon using interpolation of order 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the agreement is excellent .",
    "there is a discernible difference between the 3d and cartoon runs after time @xmath147 , starting with a slight bump that can be seen in the slab evolution that is not present in the full 3d simulation .",
    "this is due to slight differences in the boundary treatment in the two cases .",
    "there is no known perfect outgoing wave condition for general relativity ( nor even a clear way to identify what a wave is in a nonlinear situation such as this ) , and small differences in boundary treatment can lead to differing amounts of reflection at the boundaries .",
    "the different geometries of the two simulations lead to different characteristics of the boundary treatment , which are ultimately reflected in the results .",
    "the origin of this difference is well - understood , to be expected , and minor , and is unrelated to the main thrust of this paper .",
    "we have developed a novel technique for computational simulations with certain symmetries .",
    "this cartoon technique allows simulations to be performed in 3d  cartesian coordinates , thereby avoiding difficulties associated with coordinate singularities that often lead to numerical instabilities .",
    "compared to the full 3d  cartesian approach , cartoon allows a huge savings in both memory and computational time , without introducing problems commonly associated with the singular coordinate systems which are usually employed",
    ". the cartoon technique should be useful for any system of partial differential equations , and we have shown that it works well in one of the most complicated sets of equations in theoretical physics , einstein s equations of general relativity .    while this approach to axisymmetric simulation inherits many of the advantages of 3d  cartesian simulations , there are also some disadvantages which carry over . for example , a 2d code using angular coordinates can align spherical boundaries at constant coordinate value .",
    "furthermore , a logarithmic or other stretched radial coordinate can be introduced that significantly improves resolution for problems with asymptotic @xmath148 fall - off .",
    "even though neither of these techniques are readily incorporated in the cartoon method , we nonetheless expect cartoon to have a great impact on numerical relativity , as general purpose stable 2d codes are not currently available in the field .",
    "furthermore , as most fully 3d simulations are carried out in the same cartesian coordinates as are found in cartoon , experience gained from the accelerated cartoon simulations should carry over directly to the full 3d work .",
    "this has generally not been the case previously , as special coordinate systems used for axisymmetric or spherically symmetric systems also required special treatments and gauge conditions that simply were not applicable in 3d  cartesian coordinates .",
    "hence with our new technique systems can be studied with the _ same _ coordinate systems , with the _ same _ gauges , and with the _ same _ analysis tools as they will be when performed in full 3d .",
    "finally , this technique has the potential to allow for a number of intrinsically axisymmetric systems to be studied with unprecedented stability and accuracy , since simulations with resolutions of several thousand grid points on a side are readily achievable .",
    "we have implemented this technique in the cactus code for 3d numerical relativity and the cactus computational toolkit , and we expect that it will be a powerful addition to the field of numerical relativity .    * acknowledgments . * the basic idea for this work",
    "was suggested by steven brandt .",
