    "the suppression of inclusive @xmath5 spectra of identified particles in central au+au collisions with respect to p+p and peripheral au+au collisions  @xcite and the enhanced baryon / meson ratios  @xcite show that baryons and mesons behave differently than in p+p collisions for @xmath5  =  2 - 6  gev/@xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that fragmentation is not dominant and parton recombination and coalescence models  @xcite have been suggested as alternative mechanisms of particle production .",
    "moreover , studies of di - hadron correlations in au+au revealed the presence of an additional long - range pseudo - rapidity correlation ( _ ridge _ ) on the near - side  @xcite , which is absent in p+p and d+au collisions .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the properties of two - particle correlations using strange trigger particles ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) associated with unidentified charged particles in d+au and au+au collisions at @xmath4  =  200  gev with star .",
    "we investigate the near - side associated yield as a function of centrality , system size , @xmath5 and strangeness content in the trigger particle , to look for possible flavor and baryon / meson differences .",
    "we compare our results to a fragmentation and recombination model .",
    "the correlation functions , normalized to the number of trigger particles , are corrected for the reconstruction efficiency of associated particles , elliptic flow ( @xmath7 ) and , unless mentioned otherwise , triangular acceptance in @xmath8 .",
    "the near - side yield of associated particles is calculated as the area under the gaussian peak obtained from a fit .",
    "we study separately the jet and ridge contributions to the near - side yield by analyzing the correlations in two @xmath8 windows : @xmath9  0.7 containing both jet and ridge correlations , and @xmath10  0.7 containing only the ridge contributions , assuming the jet contribution at large @xmath8 is negligible .",
    "the jet yield is free of systematic uncertainties due to the @xmath7 subtraction if a uniformity of @xmath7 with @xmath11 is assumed . for the ridge yield ,",
    "these systematic errors are estimated by subtracting the @xmath7 measured by the event plane method ( the lower bound ) and by the 4-particle cumulant method ( the upper bound ) .",
    "comparing the near - side yields in d+au and au+au collisions , we observe a strong increase by a factor of 3 - 4 going from d+au to central au+au collisions .",
    "studying separately the jet and ridge contributions to the near - side yield ( fig .",
    "[ rjcentr ] ) , we find that the ridge yield rises with centrality and is responsible for the observed strong increase of the near - side yield with centrality .",
    "the jet yield is independent of centrality and consistent with that in d+au collisions .",
    "no significant baryon / meson or particle / anti - particle differences are observed .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]",
    "we have reported results on two - particle correlations with strange trigger particles at intermediate-@xmath5 at rhic .",
    "the correlations reveal a strong contribution from the long - range @xmath8 correlations in the near - side .",
    "we do not observe any significant baryon / meson differences .",
    "the behavior of the central - to - peripheral ratio of the near - side yields agrees qualitatively with a recombination model .",
    "however , for the @xmath3-triggered correlations there exist associated particles in the near - side , which disagrees with the model . studies of jet and ridge yields for @xmath3-triggered correlations as well as correlations with identified associated particles are expected to constrain the origin of these correlations .",
