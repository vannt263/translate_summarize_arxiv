    "galaxy formation and evolution is believed to be driven primarily by two processes : firstly , the successive merging of their parent dark matter halos causing accretion of material and ultimately mergers between galaxies ; and secondly , the feedback - regulated conversion of gas into stars within galactic disks with subsequent potential rearrangement of the disk material by dynamical processes ( secular evolution ) .",
    "both processes contribute to the growth in stellar mass of galaxies with time .",
    "the stellar mass function of galaxies and its evolution with time is therefore fundamental to the understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "the ability to estimate galaxy stellar masses has advanced in recent years in large part because of increasing access to near - ir photometry .",
    "estimates are typically made by fitting multi - band photometry with stellar population synthesis libraries ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , fitting specific spectral features when spectroscopy is available @xcite , or the full spectrum when high - quality spectra are observed @xcite .",
    "so far , only the photometric fitting technique has been a viable option for high - redshift surveys .",
    "these measurements provide masses with accuracies of @xmath13  dex , and systematic uncertainties of up to a factor of two depending on the selection and number of photometric bands included and the assumptions made on , among others , the shape of the imf , the allowed star formation histories , the dust extinction model , or the underlying stellar population synthesis method ( see , e.g. , @xcite for systematic studies on this matter ) .    utilizing such techniques ,",
    "the build - up of the stellar mass density from redshift @xmath14 to the present epoch has been the subject of several studies in the past decade , often relying on deep multi - band imaging surveys in the uv to near - infrared wavelength range @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass function in the local universe has been measured from large imaging and spectroscopic surveys such as 2df , sdss , and 2mass @xcite . at distances up to @xmath15 ,",
    "a number of groups have established a picture of the evolution of the mass function with some detail @xcite , with generally good agreement between different datasets . to some lesser detail and accuracy ,",
    "deep surveys have provided data spanning @xmath16 @xcite , and even some estimates at @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "so far , these high - redshift studies of the stellar mass function emphasized the evolution of galaxies of mass @xmath18 .",
    "speaking very broadly , the stellar mass density decreases by a factor of two to @xmath6 , with the most massive galaxies already being in place at earlier epochs .",
    "the evolution appears to accelerate quickly beyond @xmath19 .    in this paper , we concentrate on the low - mass galaxies that have typically been below the completeness limits of previous work at @xmath20 .",
    "generally @xcite fits to the galaxy stellar mass function with faint - end slope @xmath21 to @xmath22 have been found adequate to describe the galaxy population ( even separated morphologically , by color , or star formation activity ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , though , a steepening of the slope of the luminosity function below @xmath23 in the local universe has been convincingly detected in clusters @xcite , groups @xcite , and in the field @xcite .",
    "for example , @xcite find that the luminosity function in the virgo cluster , in the ngc  1407 group , and in the coma  1 group is steep between @xmath24 of -18 and -15 ( and flattens again only at @xmath25 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite find that the local galaxy stellar mass function steepens as well below @xmath26 ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "the steepening of the mass function can also be interpreted as a bimodality : the mass function consists of a sum of ( at least ) two components .",
    "this bimodal behavior has now also been detected at redshifts @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite find bimodal mass functions to @xmath28 from the zcosmos spectroscopic survey .",
    "they interpret the mass function as being composed of early - type galaxies dominating the massive part and late - type galaxies dominating the less massive part and contributing the steep faint - end slope .",
    "each of these components is well fit by a schechter function .",
    "@xcite use the same sample to investigate the bimodality as a function of environment .",
    "they find that at @xmath29 , the shape of the galaxy stellar mass function in high- and low - density environments become markedly different , with high density regions showing a stronger bimodality .",
    "we extend the study of the shape of the galaxy stellar mass function , particularly at low masses , to @xmath6 , with stellar mass limits @xmath30  dex lower than can be achieved with spectroscopic studies .",
    "we investigate actively star - forming galaxies and passively evolving galaxies separately ; we study how the change in slope may be caused by the presence of multiple galaxy populations , that taken together , lead to a mass function shape that is more complex than a single power law with an exponential cutoff or even a simple combination of early- and late - type components .",
    "we show that the blue mass function itself is bimodal and that passive galaxies exhibit a faint - end upturn , likely caused by dwarf spheroidal galaxies linked to the faint end of the blue galaxy population .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in   [ sec : sample ] we introduce the galaxy sample that we use in this work . in   [ sec : stellar - mass ] we discuss the stellar population models used to derive stellar masses and the resulting mass completeness limits . in   [ sec : mf ] we present the stellar mass function of active and passive galaxies and we discuss our results in   [ sec : discuss ] . finally , we summarize this work in   [ sec : summary ] .    throughout this work",
    "we assume @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "we will denote galaxy stellar masses by the symbol @xmath33  or @xmath34 where an explicit distinction form halo masses , denoted by @xmath35 , is necessary .",
    "the symbol @xmath3 is reserved for the characteristic mass parameter of the schechter function .",
    "the primary focus of this paper is determining the abundance of low - mass galaxies and characterizing the shape of the mass function , especially at the low - mass end .",
    "these galaxies are faint by definition , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , sources that are typically beyond the range of magnitude - limited spectroscopic surveys like deep2 , vvds , or zcosmos @xcite . as such",
    ", we must rely on photometric redshifts .",
    "we use the cosmos catalog with photometric redshifts derived from 30 broad and medium bands described in @xcite and @xcite , version 1.5 , dated april 05 , 2008 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to objects with @xmath38 . at this limit ,",
    "the rms photo - z accuracy at @xmath39 is @xmath40 in @xmath41 ( fig .  9 in @xcite ) . at @xmath42",
    "the quality of the photometric redshifts quickly deteriorates .",
    "the detection completeness at @xmath43 is @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "additionally , we require a detection in the @xmath45 band to ensure that the stellar mass estimates at the faint end are still reliable , thus we add the constraint @xmath46 .",
    "the surface brightness sensitivity limit for the @xmath47 data is 28.4  mag  arcsec@xmath48 at 5@xmath49 . at this limit ,",
    "an object of 25th magnitude would have to be 5.4 arcsec across ( with no bulge ) to have a chance of being missed . at 23rd",
    "magnitude that number increases to 7 arcsec .",
    "it is hence very unlikely that surface brightness is the dominant selection effect at low luminosities where galaxies are very compact ( in contrast to the situation in local - universe surveys ; see simulations in @xcite ) .    to ensure high - quality photometric redshifts we will limit the redshift range to @xmath50 and to sample enough volume to @xmath51 .",
    "we have made sure that our results are not sensitive to this selection through repetition of our analysis with relaxed magnitude limits .",
    "our mass functions do not change shape , nor change their faint - end slope if we drop the @xmath45-band selection and push the @xmath47 selection to 26th magnitude . dropping the @xmath45-band selection leads to a gain in about one bin in depth ( 0.25  dex in mass ) , albeit with",
    "increased stellar mass errors by about 20% on individual sources below the @xmath45-band limit , but no change in the faint - end slope ( the @xmath52 and @xmath53-band still provide enough information on the nir light ) . nor do our results change if we impose a brighter selection cut of @xmath54 , apart from a restriction in redshift range .",
    "we use the photometric data in the @xmath55 ( cfht ) , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath47 , @xmath60 ( subaru ) , @xmath53 ( ukirt ) , and @xmath45 ( cfht ) bands for our analysis , totaling 9 bands .",
    "we explicitly exclude the irac1-channel data ( 3.6  @xmath61 m ) due to their confusion - limited nature at @xmath62 which would otherwise restrict the analysis to brighter magnitudes than is possible with the @xmath45 band data .",
    "this is in contrast to the mass function analysis by @xcite , who use an irac1-selected catalog .",
    "however , we have verified that adding the irac1 data where available does not alter the stellar masses significantly and our mass functions are consistent in the overlapping mass range with the ones derived by @xcite including the irac1 channel . in a similar analysis @xcite",
    "find that including irac1-irac4 at @xmath63 data does reduce the uncertainties in the mass estimate somewhat , but does not change the masses systematically ( fig .  1 in their paper ) .",
    "the reason for this is that in the redshift range of interest here ( @xmath63 ) , the restframe near - ir light is sampled well enough by the @xmath53 and @xmath45 data , so that the addition of irac1 data does not add much information about the presence of an old stellar population .",

    "in addition to the above magnitude limits , we require that a photometric redshift be assigned to the objects and that the object not be in a masked image region ( e.g.  near bright stars , image border , detector defects ) in any of the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath47 , and @xmath60 bands .",
    "the total area of the survey we use after masking is 1.73 square degrees .",
    "we use two methods to remove stars from the sample .",
    "first , sources where the best - fitting stellar sed template has a lower @xmath64 than the best - fitting galaxy sed template are discarded .",
    "this method is discussed and shown to be very reliable at @xmath65  mag ( @xcite ; 2% of the total population at @xmath65 could be stars not recognized by the sed classifier while only 0.2% of extended sources in acs are classified as stars by the @xmath64-criterion ) .",
    "in addition , we remove sources with point - like acs morphologies using the catalog presented in @xcite .",
    "this acs cut removes an additional 13% of the total number of sources and is especially important among passive galaxies at @xmath66 .",
    "we also note that @xmath67 of point - like sources in the cosmos field are found to be galaxies , however , @xcite show that these are faint high-@xmath52 objects that will not affect our analysis .",
    "our final sample contains 138001 sources in the redshift range @xmath68 .",
    "we will divide this redshift range into four equally spaced bins in the following analysis .",
    "table  [ tab : sample ] lists the number of sources in our final sample and its subsamples as well as the volume probed by each redshift bin .",
    "while our mass functions yield consistently steep faint - end slopes in all of the redshift bins studied , the lowest redshift bin provides the deepest probe of the low - mass galaxy population and our strongest constraints at this mass range .",
    "a top concern , therefore , is that distant galaxies with much larger redshifts may have been mistakenly shifted to the @xmath69 bin and , with faint apparent magnitudes , assigned masses with @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , photo-@xmath52 estimates often suffer from degeneracies between the 4000  break at @xmath71 and the lyman break at @xmath72 , especially if @xmath73-band or near - ir photometry is shallow or missing .",
    "we largely mitigate these problems by requiring detections for all sources in @xmath47 and @xmath45 in addition to implementing our magnitude limits to reject noise and false detections .",
    "we confirm this by verifying that our results do not change if we reject all sources which show a second peak in their redshift probability distribution with amplitude larger than 5% .",
    "we note that @xcite find no evidence of redshift degeneracies or persistent catastrophic outliers in the cosmos photo-@xmath52 catalog at our magnitude limits that could threaten the robustness of our result .    beyond the photometry requirements ,",
    "we have searched the nuv - r - j color - color diagram for sources with unusual colors that could indicate a contaminating population .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv_r_j ] . given the mass completeness limit estimate for each redshift bin , @xmath74 , we highlight in blue those galaxies with @xmath75 .",
    "these represent the lowest masses at which the star - forming sample is still complete .",
    "in large part , they follow the locus of star - forming galaxies .",
    "no outlier population is apparent .",
    "we have also repeated this experiment for galaxies whose photo-@xmath52 uncertainties are particularly large ( a 68% confidence interval larger than 0.5 in redshift ) and again find no evidence of contamination .",
    "finally , we use monte - carlo simulations described in more detail below to convince ourselves that the mass function is sufficiently robust against the errors in the photometric redshifts .",
    "the low - mass galaxies contributing to the steep faint - end slope of the mass function are too faint to be morphologically classified using the available hst data .",
    "instead , we turn to their colors and seds to shed light on their properties . motivated by the ability to break degeneracies between age and dust , we use a uv - optical - ir ( nuv - r - j ) color - color diagram to study our sample , finding that the best - fitting sed templates returned by the photo-@xmath52 code do a good job of distinguishing star - forming from passive galaxies .",
    "we group together sed types 18 from the cosmos photo-@xmath52 catalog as `` sed early - types '' ( see @xcite and @xcite for details on the sed templates ) and highlight them in red in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuv_r_j ] . at most redshifts ,",
    "the early - type sed designation overlaps well with the associated clump of passive galaxies identified with red nuv - r colors and blue r - j colors ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "a joint color - cut indicated by the two lines would select additional passive systems that are not selected by the sed classification . at @xmath76",
    "the color cuts select @xmath77 more passive galaxies , many of these systems scattered between star - forming and passive sequences . at @xmath6",
    ", however , the sed method identifies as many as 15% fewer galaxies in the passive clump .",
    "with none of these classifiers being demonstrably preferable , we choose to proceed with the sed - based classification .",
    "we have re - analyzed the data with the nuv - r - j - based classification , and find that the results are fully consistent .",
    "in particular , this excludes that the mass function of faint red galaxies is distorted significantly by some faint blue galaxies ( which are more numerous by a factor @xmath78 ) being misidentified as red galaxies by one of these classification methods but not the other .",
    "also , if misclassified blue galaxies were ( partly ) responsible for the faint red population , we would expect this population to become more numerous at high @xmath52 where @xmath79 is lower .",
    "this turns out not to be the case ( see below ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mr - ur ] we show the distribution of the galaxies in our sample in the absolute magnitude , @xmath80 , versus @xmath81 restframe color plane .",
    "the greyscale shading marks the density of all objects in this plane , while the blue and red contours outline the distributions of the blue and red subsamples , respectively .",
    "stellar masses ( the mass locked up in stars ) are routinely derived by comparing multi - band photometry to a grid of stellar population models of varying star formation histories ( sfhs ) , ages , and dust content .",
    "we follow the same approach in this work .",
    "our procedure is described in detail and compared against spectroscopic and dynamical mass estimates in drory , bender , & hopp @xcite , although in the present work we will explore a wider set of stellar population models described in the following paragraphs .",
    "we allow for sfhs consisting of two components : a main population of stars formed in a smooth sfh and a modulation by a second population formed in a burst of star formation just prior to observation .",
    "the main component is parameterized by a sfh of the form @xmath82 , with @xmath83 $ ]  gyr and a metallicity of @xmath84 } < 0.3 $ ] .",
    "the age , @xmath85 , ( defined as the time since the onset of star formation ) is allowed to vary between 0.5  gyr and the age of the universe at the object s redshift .",
    "we linearly combine this with a starburst modeled as a 100  myr - old constant star formation rate episode of solar metallicity .",
    "we restrict the burst fraction , @xmath86 , to the range @xmath87 in mass .",
    "higher values of @xmath86 are degenerate and unnecessary since such seds are covered by models with a young main component .",
    "we adopt a chabrier @xcite imf truncated at 0.1 and 100  @xmath88  for both components .",
    "this choice of imf is described by a power - law at @xmath89  @xmath88  and a log - normal distribution below .",
    "the chabrier imf yields masses lower by about 0.25  dex compared to a salpeter @xcite single - slope imf of the form @xmath90 .",
    "we use the stellar population synthesis codes of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bc03 ) and the bc03 models updated in 2007 with an improved treatment of tp - agb stars , hereafter referred to as bc07 models .    additionally , both components are allowed to exhibit a different and variable amount of extinction by dust .",
    "we assume a @xcite form for the extinction law .",
    "this takes into account the fact that young stars are found in dusty environments and that the starlight from the galaxy as a whole may be reddened by a ( geometry dependent ) different amount .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that the balmer decrement in the sdss sample is independent of inclination , which , on the other hand , is driving global extinction ( ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) .",
    "we verified that using the milky way extinction law or the smc extinction law instead does not change our conclusions .",
    "this is due to our restricted redshift range which means we do not probe too far into the restframe uv where the different slopes of the extinction laws matter most and because low - mass galaxies at @xmath39 are not heavily obscured , unlike galaxies of the same mass at @xmath91 .",
    "we compute the full likelihood distribution on a grid in this 6-dimensional parameter space ( @xmath92 } , t , a_v^1 , \\beta , a_v^2 $ ] ) , the likelihood of each model being @xmath93 . to compute the likelihood distribution of @xmath94",
    ", we weight the @xmath94  of each model by its likelihood and marginalize over the stellar population parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath94  is obtained from the width of this distribution , which falls between @xmath95 and @xmath96  dex at 68% confidence level on average .",
    "the uncertainty has a weak dependence on mass ( increasing with lower @xmath79 photometry ) , and much of the variation is in spectral type : early - type galaxies have more tightly constrained masses than late types .",
    "we have also compared the masses obtained with this code to the ones obtained with the code employed by @xcite and the @xcite stellar population synthesis models .",
    "we find that the masses computed by both codes are consistent and show no trends with luminosity or redshift .",
    "hence the stellar masses are not sensitive to the particular choice of grid parameters and fitting procedure ( within reasonable limits , of course ) .    of much graver concern than errors stemming from uncertainties in the photometry",
    "are systematic problems with the stellar population libraries and the implicit priors on evolutionary histories introduced by the finite model grid . for a comprehensive analysis",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one of the main issues is the treatment of the thermally pulsing horizontal giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , whose light dominates in intermediate - age ( @xmath97  gyr ) populations from the @xmath98-band through the near - ir @xcite .",
    "the contribution of these stars can lead to changes of up to a factor of two to three in the stellar mass estimates for extreme cases ( however , these are unlikely to be observed at @xmath99 ) and if the relevant wavelength range is poorly covered by the data .",
    "tp - agb spectral signatures are strongest at @xmath100 m rest - frame , which is always within the observed - frame colors in our dataset .",
    "nevertheless , we base our model grid on the bc03 models as well as on the bc07 models which incorporate an improved prescription for the treatment of the tp - agb phase ( see also @xcite ) .    despite the problems with late stellar evolutionary phases ,",
    "@xcite in a thorough investigation of population synthesis modeling , argue that the @xmath94  ratios are largely resistant to the uncertain contribution from tp - agb stars as well as other limitations in the models .",
    "we will nevertheless compare stellar masses based on both evolutionary synthesis codes to make sure our results do not depend on a specific choice of a stellar population model .",
    "determining the selection function in stellar mass for a flux - limited sample is not possible in a rigorous way : knowledge of the intrinsic frequency distribution of mass - to - light ratios of the galaxy population _ above and below _ the flux limit is necessary , but generally not available .",
    "several methods to ( conservatively ) _ estimate _ the completeness limit have been employed .",
    "most commonly and simplistically , one assumes that a maximally old population ( and hence with maximally high @xmath94  in the absence of dust ) at the flux limit of the survey will yield a conservative upper limit to the mass that potentially could be affected by incompleteness ( ( e.g .",

    "blue star forming galaxies have much more varied @xmath94values .",
    "however , the largest variation is in @xmath107 spirals , with a large contribution to this variation coming from variable dust extinction ; blue objects fainter than @xmath108 at @xmath109 have much more uniform properties @xcite and in generally much lower amounts of dust ( @xmath110  mag at @xmath70 compared to @xmath111 at @xmath112 ; @xcite ) . in accordance with the conclusions reached by @xcite in the local universe , the mass - to - light ratios at magnitudes fainter than @xmath108",
    "become roughly independent of magnitude , converging to @xmath113 . at brighter magnitudes than @xmath108 , @xmath114 rapidly increases with luminosity .",

    "we can verify these limits using the much smaller but deeper fors deep field ( fdf ) data @xcite . comparing the cosmos mass function at @xmath118 with the fdf mass function bin @xmath119 from @xcite",
    ", we see that the point where the cosmos data start to fall below the fdf data coincides with the mass limit for the blue population as estimated here ( see fig .",

    "we note that even breaking down the mass function into these two components is , in itself , an interpretation since the steepening faint - slope alone may provide a viable explanation .",
    "as we discuss below , our interest in separately identifying the dip is motivated by comparisons to the underlying halo mass function which is a strict power - law at the relevant masses . in this context , the dip represents a suppression of the stellar mass associated with halos in this range ; this is a consequence of a change in @xmath249 such that there is a smaller change in the mass of galaxies per change in the mass of halos .",
    "the purpose of this section is , hence , to explore several physical mechanisms that may explain both the upturn and the dip and to speculate on the role of future observations in distinguishing them .    using the zcosmos spectroscopic survey @xcite interpret the mass function they recover as being composed of early - type galaxies dominating the massive part and late - type galaxies dominating the less massive part and contributing to the steep faint - end slope .",

    "however , the bimodality in the blue population seems to be more pronounced at high @xmath52 compared to low @xmath52 : it becomes weaker as redshift decreases .",
    "this effect can also be seen in the @xmath64 values reported in table  [ tab : mffit ] .",
    "indeed , the best @xmath64 values for single schechter fits are obtained for the blue component at low redshift ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "the signature of the bimodality ( the dip at intermediate mass , or the bump at around @xmath3 ) `` moves '' from the blue population at high @xmath52 to the red population at low @xmath52 .",
    "this is likely because some of the blue galaxies that make up the bump around @xmath3 in the blue mass function turn red with time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "we will follow this hypothesis in the following , using the behavior of blue galaxies to stand in for interpretations of the full population and returning to red systems in the subsequent section .      before discussing possible physical explanations",

    "disk parameters such as disk radius and luminosity remain roughly constant ( with a large spread ) along the hubble sequence at types sa - scd . for types later than sd galaxies , the hubble sequence turns into a luminosity sequence , with later type morphologies corresponding to smaller and less massive galaxies ( see , for example , the review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is also worth noting that disk galaxies without a significant bulge component exist ( e.g. , hubble type sd and later ) and can be accurately characterized as pure disk systems , harboring at most a nuclear star cluster .",

    "once the ( dm ) potential is deep enough that supernova feedback can no longer remove significant amounts of gas from the halo , the attainable ratio of stellar mass to dark matter mass becomes larger as a larger fraction of the gas in the halo can cool to form stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the stellar mass function deviates upwards from its power - law form .",
    "( at the massive end , the stellar mass is limited by the cooling timescale becoming too large and the ratio of stellar mass to dark mass decreases again sharply causing the exponential cut - off in the stellar mass function @xcite . the transition from sfr efficiency suppressed by supernovae feedback",
    "to peak sfr efficiency may therefore lead to the observed dip in the stellar mass function .",
    "there are two potential tests for this scenario .",
    "the most obvious is to seek better measures of @xmath263 as a function of @xmath33 and redshift , but such observations remain challenging .",
    "a second test is to determine whether the mass scale that defines the dip evolves with redshift . because we expect @xmath263 to be higher in more massive galaxies at early times ( since at @xmath42 many more are likely to be rapidly forming stars ) , the dip in the stellar mass function should move to higher masses at early times as well . unfortunately , the mass functions presented here are likely to be too affected by cosmic variance to robustly measure redshift evolution in the dip feature , but future data sets will be able to overcome this problem . also , a more rigorous analysis taking into account cosmological gas accretion as well as a realistic feedback prescription and outflow model is needed , but is beyond the scope of this paper .    * hierarchical assembly . *",
    "another possibility is that the dip at @xmath252 and the bump around @xmath3 are formed by a depletion of stellar and gas mass at intermediate mass resulting from a pile - up of the end - products of mass - dependent assembly around @xmath3 . in this scenario , both",
    "the stellar and baryonic mass functions would exhibit dips at @xmath252 because the assembly of baryonic mass is accelerated at a certain scale .",
    "it is known that the halo - halo merger rate depends very weakly on mass @xcite . however , if the stellar mass , or in this case , baryonic mass fraction , peaks in halos at a given mass scale  perhaps as a result of the sfr feedback discussed above  the resulting merger rate in terms of stellar mass , @xmath33 , or baryonic mass , @xmath270 , can be enhanced near this scale @xcite and strengthen the dip feature .",
    "this is because the dynamical friction timescale ( and hence the merger timescale ) depends firstly on the mass ratio of the merging systems ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "low mass ratio mergers happen only after a long time , and one - to - one mergers happen quickly . at low mass ,",
    "one - to - one mergers in dm correspond to minor mergers in baryons and hence the baryonic content of a halo assembles more slowly than the halo .",
    "this is due to the steep relation between stellar mass , @xmath233 , and halo mass , @xmath234 , below @xmath3 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : abmatch ] ) . at masses near and just above the scale at which @xmath244 flattens",
    ", more frequent minor halo mergers can host one - to - one baryonic mergers and thus the baryonic assembly rates increase markedly . at even higher mass scales , above the flattening at @xmath3 of the @xmath236-relation , the infalling galaxy is much more likely to become and stay a satellite , even if the baryonic mass ratio is close to one .",
    "at this point , the baryonic merger rate drops again .    as a result ,",
    "low stellar ( baryonic ) mass galaxies get depleted more rapidly in one - to - one mergers , and pile - up around the @xmath3 mass scale ( @xmath271 ) .",
    "this scenario also suggests that the two populations of galaxies might be thought of as central galaxies occupying the bump with an increasing fraction of satellite galaxies at lower masses that possibly form the second , faint , component of the mass function , leading to a steepening of the low - mass end of the mass function .",
    "such satellites in a galaxy or group halo would orbit for a long time before merging and hence remain visible as individual galaxies .",
    "if this enhanced assembly scenario were important , it would also indicate that many major mergers between star - forming ( disk ) galaxies must not lead to a final destruction of the disk and truncation of star formation as the bump signature is already apparent in the blue galaxy population at @xmath272 .",
    "such mergers must produce a remnant that is still a blue star - forming disk galaxy .",
    "such outcomes of mergers seem possible if the gas fraction is large @xcite .",
    "also , we would expect the dip feature to deepen with time but , in contrast with sfr scenario above , remain relatively fixed with respect to mass .",
    "* steepening faint - end slope .",
    "* so far we have focused on the dip in the stellar mass function .",
    "we now turn to the steep slopes at the low - mass end . to the extent that this feature is unrelated to the dip forming",
    "process mentioned above , we can consider several possibilities . to begin with ,",
    "many authors interpret the faint - end slope as rising to the maximum set by the halo mass function ( with a value of -2 ) .",
    "such behavior is expected if feedback processes that regulate the star formation efficiency become increasingly independent of @xmath258 below some scale . at low masses , for example",
    ", supernova feedback may so dominate over the ability of halos to retain gas , that the effective gas or stellar mass fraction becomes a constant , independent of halo mass .",
    "we now turn to the behavior of the red galaxy mass function . in the redshift bins @xmath212 and @xmath211 , where the faint red component of the mass function is sampled well ,",
    "the number density of all galaxies at @xmath273 does not change much ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mf_lit ] and table  [ tab : mffit ] ) .",
    "yet , the number density of faint red galaxies increases by 0.45  dex , a combined effect of the normalization increasing from @xmath274 to @xmath275 and the characteristic mass of the low - mass component increasing from @xmath276 to @xmath277 .",
    "this evolution in faint red galaxies is nearly perfectly mirrored by a decrease in number of faint blue galaxies . as we have noted above , the faint end slope of the active and the passive population is consistent with being equal .",
    "the similarity of the steep faint - end slopes of the active and faint passive populations and their reciprocal change in number density is suggestive of the latter originating from the former by shutting off star formation .",
    "it is very tempting to identify these two faint galaxy populations sharing the same steep faint - end slope with sm / im / dirr galaxies , and faint spheroidal galaxies , respectively .",
    "it is established that passively evolving dwarf galaxies cluster around massive galaxies @xcite , and tidal interactions or ram pressure stripping may well lead to quenching and some subsequent phase mixing turning sm / im galaxies into faint spheroidal galaxies @xcite . also , @xcite finds that in the cfhtls in the redshift bin @xmath278 the clustering amplitude for faint red galaxies is actually higher than that of bright red galaxies , which is to be expected in our interpretation .",
    "following on previous studies of the stellar mass function in the cosmos field @xcite , we present a new analysis of this data set that provides mass functions to fainter limits than has been previously probed at @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting increase in dynamic range allows us to characterize and study features in the shape of the stellar mass function that deviate from a single schechter function .",
    "we have tested whether these features could be introduced by a variety of systematic effects including both catastrophic photometric redshift errors as well as increasing photo-@xmath52 uncertainty at low masses , differences in the way stellar population models account for tp - agb stars , and the ability of stellar mass codes to convert from luminosity to mass .",
    "we conclude that our results are robust to these effects , although the data are still limited by cosmic variance .",
    "our key results follow :    * neither the total nor the red ( passive ) or blue ( star - forming ) galaxy stellar mass functions can be well fit with a single schechter function once the the mass completeness limit of the sample probes below roughly @xmath279 .",
    "we model this more complicated behavior using a double schechter function with 6 free parameters , and present the fitting results for 4 redshift bins to @xmath280 . *",
    "the bimodal nature of the mass function is _ not _ solely a result of the blue / red dichotomy .",
    "indeed , the blue mass function is already bimodal at @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests a new 2-component model for galaxy formation that predates the appearance of the red sequence .",
    "* we propose two interpretations for this bimodal distribution , focusing on the `` dip '' in the blue mass function at @xmath810@xmath281 .",
    "if the gas fraction increases at lower stellar masses , galaxies with @xmath282 would shift to lower stellar masses , creating the observed dip .",
    "this would indicate a change in sfr efficiency , perhaps arising from the influence of supernovae feedback which likely sets in below scales of @xmath810@xmath9 . in this picture",
    ", the baryonic mass function should not show a dip .",
    "using published ( cold ) gas fractions as a function of stellar mass , we show that cold gas alone is not sufficient to eliminate the dip in the baryonic mass function , but that the addition of the hard to detect warm gas could potentially flatten out the baryonic mass function considerably . * alternatively , the dip could be created by an enhancement of the galaxy assembly rate at @xmath810@xmath10 , a phenomenon that naturally arises if the baryon fraction peaks at @xmath283 . in this scenario",
    "we would identify the galaxies occupying the bump around @xmath12 with central galaxies and the increasing fraction of satellite galaxies at lower mass with the second , fainter , component of the mass function and in particular the steep faint - end slope . *",
    "the low - mass end of the blue and total mass functions exhibit a steeper slope than has been detected in previous work .",
    "this can be interpreted as a _ steepening _ slope , one that may increasingly approach the halo mass function value of -2 . *",
    "while the dip feature is apparent in the total mass function at all redshifts , it appears to shift from the blue to red population , likely as a result of transforming high - mass blue galaxies into red ones .",
    "* at the same time , we detect a drastic upturn in the number of low mass red galaxies .",
    "their increase with time seems to reflect a decrease in the number blue systems and so we tentatively associate them with satellite ( dwarf spheroidal ) galaxies that have undergone quenching due to environmental processes .    while the broad dynamic range of the cosmos data set allows us to begin to characterize some of the more subtle features of the stellar mass function , the single cosmos field",
    "is still limited by cosmic variance . future work over several fields will verify the trends here and shed light on possible interpretations by constraining how these features evolve with redshift .",
