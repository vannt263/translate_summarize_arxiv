    "in order to understand both the early phase of galaxy evolution and the cosmic history of intergalactic space ( i.e. , the cosmic re - ionization of intergalactic medium ) , it is crucially important to probe any objects at very high redshift . in this decade , ground - based 8-m class telescopes have enabled us to find a large number of galaxies beyond @xmath8 ( e.g. , hu et al . 2002 ; rhoads et al .",

    "hst _ and large ground - based telescope facilities ( bouwens et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "in addition , recent deep near infrared imaging surveys with 8-m class ground - based telescopes provided probable candidates of galaxies beyond @xmath10 ( e.g. , hibon et al . 2010 ) .    more recently , the successful installation of the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on _ hst _ was promptly used to observe hudf in the nir window .",
    "using these imaging data , very promising candidates of high-@xmath3 galaxies at @xmath11  10 were found by several researchers ( bouwens et al .",

    "( 1 ) the number density of luminous galaxies appears to become smaller with increasing redshift while that of less luminous ones appears to be constant ( bouwens et al .",
    "( 2 ) the galaxies beyond @xmath11 tend to have bluer uv continuum with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , significantly bluer than the typical @xmath14 of nearby starburst galaxies and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath15 ( bouwens et al .",

    "( 2010 ) . however , checking their positions and thumbnails , we identify z8-sd24 as yd5 and there is no counterpart of z8-sd15 in the samples of the other three groups .",
    "only four galaxies ( nos . 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 in table 1 ) are commonly identified by all five groups .",
    "since the five groups made their own data reduction , their final images are different from each other .",
    "in fact , their zero points are slightly different from each other . in addition",
    ", their selection criteria for galaxies at @xmath0 are also different ; see a summary of their selection criteria given in table [ tab : selection ] .",
    "three groups ( bouwens et al .",
    "2010b ; bunker et al . 2010",
    "; yan et al . 2010 ) selected @xmath0 galaxies using the dropout method ( @xmath1-dropout ) while the others ( mclure et al .",
    "2010 ; finkelstein et al .",
    "2010 ) selected @xmath0 galaxies using the photometric redshift technique .",
    "although the selection criteria are slightly different from group to group , we adopt @xmath2 as our primary criterion for galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "possible interlopers are very strong emission - line galaxies with very weak continuum emission like blue compact dwarf galaxies ; e.g. , i zw 18 ( izotov et al . 1999 ) .",
    "strong emission lines may modify observed broadband colors and thus make false continuum break features .",
    "actually , in the local universe , metal - poor galaxies with large emission - line equivalent widths have been surveyed using their unusual broadband colors caused by strong emission lines ( brown et al .",
    "2008 ) . recently , using the data of the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( abazajian et al . 2009 ) , cardamone et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigated a class of compact star - forming galaxies called `` green peas . '' because of their very strong [ oiii]@xmath55007 emission line with a rest - frame equivalent width of @xmath23([oiii])@xmath24  , `` green peas '' in the redshift range of @xmath25 are very bright in @xmath26 band .",
    "their @xmath27 colors are bluer by @xmath28 mag than those of normal galaxies .",
    "such ultra strong emission - line galaxies have also been found up to @xmath29 ( kakazu et al .",
    "2007 ; hu et al . 2009",
    "; see also ohyama et al .",
    "1999 ) .    since the strongest emission line is generally [ o iii]@xmath55007 for such dwarf starburst galaxies ( e.g. , izotov et al .",
    "1999 ; brown et al . 2008 ; cardamone et al . 2009 ) , it is possible that strong emission - line galaxies at @xmath22  2 could be detected as @xmath1 dropouts if their optical continuum emission is very weak . to demonstrate this , we show a typical spectrum of a strong emission - line galaxy at @xmath30 ( figure [ fig : emline_zwl ] ) . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we first examine if this type of contamination could accidentally occur in the identification of galaxies at @xmath0 in hudf .",
    "we make our model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for star - forming galaxies .",
    "first , we generate model galaxy seds with nebular continuum emission using the population synthesis model , starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) , adopting the mode of constant star formation ( sfr ) rate together with both salpeter initial mass function ( imf ; the lower and upper masses are 1 @xmath31 and 100 @xmath31 , respectively ) and the metallicity of @xmath32 .",
    "these models correspond to nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies with very high sfrs and sub - solar metallicities ( e.g. , @xmath33 ) , such as i zw 18 ( izotov et al . 1999 ) .    the nebular continuum is important in this analysis since it affects the global shape of the seds , especially for young starburst galaxies ( schaerer 2003 ; bouwens et al .",
    "we calculate the luminosity of the nebular continuum ( free - free , free - bound , and two photon emission for h and he ) assuming that the escape fraction of the ionizing continuum is @xmath34 .",
    "this value is consistent with observations of star - forming galaxies at @xmath29  3 ( e.g. , malkan et al .",
    "2003 ; siana et al .",
    "2007 ; steidel et al . 2001 ) ; where we expect strong emission - line galaxies as possible interlopers .",
    "however , since nebular emission lines are not included in the above seds generated by starburst99 , we add some emission lines to the sed generated above .",
    "our procedures are as follows .",
    "first , we calculate the luminosity of h@xmath35 emission line , @xmath36 , using the following relation ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the ionizing photon production rate estimated in each sed model .",
    "second , we estimate other emission lines ( e.g. , [ o ii ] @xmath5 3727 , [ o iii ] @xmath5 5007 , and so on ) , adopting the observed emission - line ratios of i zw 18 ( izotov et al . 1999 ) , which is one of the most metal - poor galaxies known in the local universe .",
    "then , we add all emission lines with @xmath39 from [ o ii ] @xmath5 3727 to [ ar iii ] @xmath5 7135 .",
    "note that the emission - line equivalent widths tend to be larger with decreasing metallicity because here we use the fixed emission - line ratios of i zw 18 .",
    "given the star formation history , the equivalent widths of emission lines vary with the age of a galaxy because the emission - line luminosities are proportional to the production rate of ionizing photons .",
    "figure [ fig : ew_csfe2_2.eps ] shows the evolution of equivalent width of h@xmath35 , [ o iii]@xmath55007 , and [ o ii]@xmath53727 in our model seds . in the next section , we examine the variation of observed colors as a function of redshift for the model galaxies with ages of 1 , 10 , and 100 myr .",
    "the values of @xmath23(h@xmath35 ) are 520 , 160 , and 70    for galaxies with ages of 1 , 10 , and 100 myr , respectively .",
    "first , we examine if some low-@xmath3 strong emission - line galaxies accidentally satisfy the selection criterion for galaxies at @xmath0 galaxies ; i.e. , @xmath2 . in figure [ fig : colorvsz ] , we show the variation of @xmath40 colors of the model galaxies with age of 1 , 10 , and 100 myr described in section 4 as a function of redshift ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "it is shown that the reddest @xmath40 color is achieved at @xmath42 for the model with age of 1 myr . in this case , the @xmath6 magnitude is dominated by the four strong emission lines of [ o iii]@xmath55007 , [ o iii]@xmath54959 , h@xmath35 , and h@xmath43 ( see figure [ fig : emline_zwl ] ) . however , the color is as red as @xmath44 because [ o ii]@xmath53727 contributes to the flux in @xmath1 .",
    "another red peak with @xmath45 is seen at @xmath46 .",
    "this feature is due to redshifted h@xmath47 emission in @xmath6 .",
    "a broad red peak around @xmath48 is due to [ o ii]@xmath53727 in @xmath49 , but the color is only @xmath50 . here",
    "we note that the [ o ii ] emission is generally weaker than [ o iii ] in metal - poor , star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , nagao et al .",
    "for the models with ages of 10 myr and 100 myr , the reddest color appears to be @xmath51 0.2  0.25 at most around @xmath52 .    in summary ,",
    "strong emission - line galaxies at @xmath42 give rise to @xmath53 with the reddest color of 0.35 at @xmath54 .",
    "these colors are much bluer than the primary criterion of @xmath2 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "however , at this stage , we can not conclude that there is no contamination by strong emission - line galaxies around @xmath22 because the following two points must be also taken into account ; ( 1 ) reddening , and ( 2 ) photometric errors in the wfc3 observations of hudf .",
    "as for the reddening , it is known that nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies are reddened in the range of @xmath55 ( kong et al .",
    "however , we do not know how star - forming galaxies at @xmath21 2 galaxies are typically reddened .",
    "since they may be more massive than nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies , they may be more strongly reddened .",
    "for example , the extinction in star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 selected as bx galaxies ranges from @xmath56 to 1.5 ( shapley et al . 2005 ) . taking account of this , for the safety",
    ", we investigate the three cases ; @xmath57 , 1 , and 2 mag together with the reddening curve for starburst galaxies obtained by calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . to examine the reddening effect",
    ", first we use the @xmath40 versus @xmath58 diagram because this diagram is used to identify galaxies at @xmath0 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "in addition , we also use another diagram of @xmath40 versus @xmath59 diagram .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "if some @xmath0 galaxy candidates are strong emission - line galaxies at @xmath4 , the optical advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging data of the hudf are also useful .",
    "since the acs survey depth ( 5@xmath60 , @xmath61 ) is 29.4 ab for @xmath62 , 29.8 ab for @xmath63 , 29.7 ab for @xmath64 , and 29.0ab for @xmath17 ( bouwens et al .",
    "2010b ) , @xmath59 gives the strongest constraint on the contamination possibility ; see appendix a. following the selection criteria of @xmath0 galaxies in the five groups , we calculate a lower limit of @xmath59 color adopting @xmath65 upper limit of @xmath64 .    in figure [",
    "fig : yjjh ] , we show comparisons between our sed models with the effect of reddening and the wfc3 photometry by the five groups . since we also show the photometric errors in each diagram , we can examine the possibility of contamination from strong emission - line galaxies at @xmath3 = 1.47 to 1.81 taking account of both the effects of reddening and photometric errors simultaneously .",
    "it is extremely difficult to estimate the properties of the population of potential contaminant @xmath66 emission line galaxies , but we can qualitatively estimate the robustness of each @xmath67 candidate using the reddening required for an emission - line galaxy at @xmath66 to mimic that object s colors . at first",
    ", we summarize our results as follows .",
    "( 1 ) the @xmath0 galaxy candidates identified both by bouwens et al . ( 2010b ) and by bunker et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are free from the contamination of strong emission - line galaxies unless strong emission - line galaxies with @xmath68 exist at @xmath21 1.5  2 .",
    "( 2 ) however , if strong emission - line galaxies with @xmath69 1  2 are present at @xmath21 1.5  2 , it is possible that some of the @xmath0 galaxy candidates identified by mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , yan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and finkelstein et al . (",
    "2010 ) are strong emission - line galaxies at @xmath21 1.5  2 .    here",
    "we should note that the above different results among the five groups are due to the differences in photometry ; i.e. , some candidates have a non - zero probability to be an interloper in the sample of one group , but not another .",
    "however , more importantly , we should also mention that heavily obscured dwarf galaxies with very strong emission lines are probably rare from observational material obtained to date .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the possibilities of low-@xmath3 interlopers are negligibly small for all the @xmath0 galaxies identified by each group .",
    "in this section , we discuss the properties of galaxies robustly determined to be at @xmath0 . in the last section , we have shown that the contamination of low-@xmath3 strong emission - line galaxies is negligibly small for all candidates studied by the five groups . however , it is important to note that there might be other unexpected contamination sources ( see , e.g. , the summary of bouwens et al .",
    "2009 ) , and so careful procedures are absolutely necessary to identify robust candidates at high redshift even if we use deep wfc3 imaging data . in particular , they find that a large fraction of nine candidates ( 10  18 in table [ tab : candidats ] ) identified only by yan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) are quite close to foreground galaxies and they may be affected by foreground bright sources .",
    "we therefore do not use the nine objects .",
    "we also do not use both 19 and 20 that are detected only by finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) since these objects are also close to foreground bright objects .",
    "taking all these into account , we have constructed a sample of eight robust galaxies at @xmath0 all that are identified by at least two groups .",
    "these galaxies are from 1 to 8 in table 1 .",
    "we summarize their photometric properties in table 3 .",
    "we note here that our robust sample is merely robust in the sense that these candidates have been selected by at least two groups and do not lie near foreground galaxies : spectroscopic follow - up is necessary to confirm that they are truly robust @xmath70 galaxies .    here",
    "it is noted that all the five groups tried to do their best in extraction of the total magnitude for their sample galaxies although their methods and photometric zero points are slightly different and then applied an aperture correction , ( 3 ) mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) : aperture photometry with 0.6 arcsec @xmath71 and then applied an aperture correction , ( 4 ) yan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) : mag_auto with kron factor = 1.2 and then applied an aperture correction , and ( 5 ) finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) : mag_auto with kron factor = 1.2 and then applied an aperture correction . ] .",
    "in fact , the magnitudes and colors for the same objects tabulated in table 3 are slightly different among the groups .",
    "therefore , in our later analysis ( section 6.3 ) , we use mean values given in the last column of table 3 . for the value of @xmath72",
    ", we calculate the average of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , the systematic error of @xmath73 ( @xmath75 ) , the mean of the random error @xmath76 , and the total errors @xmath77 are as follows : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the number of data .",
    "the lower limit values are simply ignored for calculating the mean photometry , although in all cases they are consistent with the mean value from the true detection .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss how the star - forming galaxies contribute to the cosmic re - ionization at @xmath0 .",
    "since the cosmic reioniztion is one of important issues in high - redshift universe , several investigations have been made for these years .",
    "based on the survey of @xmath3-band dropouts in the subaru deep field and the subaru xmm - newton deep survey , ouchi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) evaluated the ionizing photon production rate of star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 adopting salpeter stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath83 ) . comparing it with the critical ionizing photon production rate obtained by madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , they found the ionizing photon production rate of star - forming galaxies is enough to complete re - ionization of the universe if the escape fraction is larger than 0.2 and suggested that the properties of very high redshift ( @xmath11 ) galaxies are different from those at low redshifts , e.g. , a larger escape fraction , a lower metallicity , and/or a flatter initial mass function if the very high redshift universe is ionized by only galaxies .",
    "bunker et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also discussed the relation between the high-@xmath3 galaxies and the cosmic re - ionization at @xmath11 based on the survey of @xmath3-band dropouts in the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "bunker et al .",
    "( 2010 ) pointed out that the ionizing photon production rate of star - forming galaxies at @xmath11 is lower than the critical value adopting the relation for the solar metallicity .",
    "mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) calculated the evolution of the filling factor of the ionized hydrogen assuming the sub - solar metallicity ( @xmath83 ) and the escape fraction of 0.2 and found that the inter - galactic medium would not achieve a unity hii filling factor until @xmath84 .",
    "their findings also suggested that the star - forming galaxies at very high-@xmath3 are the large escape fraction of ionizing photons , the lower metallicity , and/or the top - heavy imf .",
    "now , we focus on the cosmic re - ionization by galaxies at @xmath0 . here",
    "we use the formalism studied by madau et al .",
    "however , we do not use the critical sfr to complete the cosmic re - ionization ( e.g. , equation ( 27 ) in madau et al . 1999 ) since the salpeter imf and the solar metallicity are assumed there .",
    "instead , we estimate the production rate of ionizing photons based on the uv luminosity functions obtained by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b , 2010c ) . using equation ( 26 ) in madau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) together with the update of cosmological parameters given in section 1 , we obtain the following critical ionizing photon production rate density ,    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the cosmic baryon density and @xmath87 is the hubble parameter in units of @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is the clumping factor of neutral hydrogen , @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the local and cosmic mean density of neutral hydrogen ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath93 from _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ 5 year data ( komatsu et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the clumping factor @xmath89 is conventionally assumed to be 30 based on cosmological radiative transfer simulations by gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) . however , smaller values for @xmath89 have been recently suggested by cosmological hydrodynamic simulation in which photo - ionization heating together with radiative cooling is taken into account ( pawlik et al .",
    "2009 ) . since the pressure support increases and then smooths out small - scale density fluctuations , the photo - ionization heating reduces the clumping factor down to @xmath94  5 .",
    "the clumping factor depends on the starting redshift of reheating , @xmath95 . if @xmath95 = 19.5 , @xmath96 , while if @xmath95 = 9 , @xmath97 . in this paper",
