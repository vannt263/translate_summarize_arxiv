    "boson stars were first introduced in the late sixties in @xcite .",
    "they consists of a complex scalar field coupled to gravity .",
    "various families of boson stars have been constructed , with various potentials for the scalar field , with or without rotation , in various dimensions ( see @xcite and references therein ) ...    one of the main motivation for the study of boson stars is the fact that they can act as black mimickers @xcite .",
    "what it means is that they can have a large mass with a small size without developing any horizon nor singularity .",
    "moreover boson stars have no hard surface , the scalar field interacting with ordinary matter only trough gravitation .",
    "possible scenarii for the formation of boson stars have been studied .",
    "there has also been a number of studies that proposed observational means of discriminating boson stars from black holes .",
    "this could for instance be done by direct imaging of the galactic center @xcite .",
    "observations of gravitational waves could also be a fruitful way of investigating the nature of the compact objects observed in the universe @xcite .",
    "apart from being an alternative to black holes , boson stars are very interesting testbeds for a lot of situations where intense gravitational fields play a role .",
    "for instance , in a previous paper , we investigated a class of peculiar orbits for massive particles @xcite .",
    "other specific effects concerning the imaging of accretion disks around boson stars were studied in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the current paper is to investigate the existence of light rings around boson stars .",
    "those are closed ( circular ) orbits of photons . they can only appear for very compact objects ( dubbed ultracompact in @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that black holes can admit light rings and that they can lie outside the horizon .",
    "the link between light rings and various instabilities is explored in a recent study by v. cardoso _ al .",
    "light rings can also be important in the context of gravitational waves .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the first gravitational wave signals observed by the ligo observatory @xcite could not discriminate between black holes and alternative compact objects .",
    "indeed , the observed ringdown signal is shown to be an indication of the existence of a light ring and not of an horizon .",
    "horizonless objects with light rings would have the same ringdown signal as the one observed .",
    "the existence of boson stars ( even if unlikely ) , could not be excluded , provided some of them admit light rings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : models ] the reader is reminded about models of boson stars .",
    "in particular , the high compactness of such objects is exhibited .",
    "section   [ s : rings ] describes the study of light rings by means of an effective potential method . in sec .",
    "[ s : points ] a particular class of light rings , where the photons are _ at rest _ , is investigated .",
    "the existence of those _ light points _ is a new effect that is typical of boson stars .",
    "indeed , their appearance requires an intense gravitational field but they can not exist in the case of black holes due to the presence of the horizon .",
    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ s : ccl ] .",
    "in this section we recall the setting used in   @xcite to compute boson star spacetimes .",
    "boson stars consist of a complex scalar field @xmath0 coupled to gravity .",
    "this is achieved by considering the following action [ e : action ] s = (l_g + l _ ) dx^4 , where @xmath1 is the hilbert - einstein lagrangian and @xmath2 the lagrangian of the complex scalar field .",
    "they are given by the standard expressions    _ g & = & r + l_&= & -[_^| + v(||^2 ) ] .",
    "@xmath3 denotes the covariant derivative associated to @xmath4 and @xmath5 the ricci scalar .",
    "@xmath6 is a potential that can be modified to construct various models of boson stars . in this paper one",
    "considers the simplest possible choice where the scalar field is a free - field and which implies that    v(||^2 ) = ||^2 .",
    "@xmath7 is the mass of the individual boson and the factor @xmath8 then appears as a scale factor for the various quantities ( distances , masses ... ) . throughout this paper geometric units",
    "are used , such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "rotating boson stars are computed by demanding that the scalar field takes the form = (r , ) [i(t - k ) ] , where @xmath11 is the amplitude of the field ( and so a real ) , @xmath12 is a real constant ( smaller than @xmath8 ) and @xmath13 an integer known as the rotational quantum number . due to the @xmath14 symmetry of the action ( [ e : action ] ) , it does not depend on @xmath15 and @xmath16 , leading to axisymmetric solutions .",
    "this is why the amplitude @xmath11 depends on @xmath17 only .",
    "the numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 appears as parameters of the various boson stars .",
    "let us point out that the case @xmath18 corresponds to spherically symmetric boson stars .    for the metric",
    ", quasi - isotropic coordinates are well adapted to the symmetry of the problem .",
    "the metric reads g _",
    "dx^x^= -n^2 dr^2 + a^2 (dr^2 + r^2d^2 ) + b^2 r^2 ^ 2(d^2 + ^^2 ) .    in the 3 + 1 language , @xmath19 is the lapse , the shift vector is @xmath20 and the spatial metric @xmath21 .",
    "the unknowns are the functions @xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , all of them depending only on @xmath17 .",
    "the unknown fields obey the einstein - klein - gordon system which results from the variation of the action ( [ e : action ] ) with respect to both the metric @xmath4 and the scalar field @xmath0 .",
    "those equations are solved by means of highly accurate spectral methods , implemented by the kadath library @xcite .",
    "this enabled us to compute sequences of rotating boson stars for @xmath13 ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "numerical methods and tests are given in details in @xcite .",
    "we present here the sequences in a different way : by plotting the compactness of the various configurations . in order to do so",
    ", one needs to define the radius of the boson stars .",
    "this can not be done unambiguously because the scalar field extends up to infinity and those objects have no true surface . in the following",
    ", the radius @xmath5 of the boson star is defined as the radius where the field is @xmath27 times its maximal value , in the equatorial plane .",
    "the precise value of the thus defined radius obviously depends on the value of the threshold ( here @xmath27 ) . however , due to the fast decay of the field far from the origin , it is a small effect .",
    "figure [ f : rad ] shows the radii of the various boson star models .",
    "one can clearly see the known facts that the size of a boson star increases with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "radii of the various boson stars .",
    "it is defined as the radius where the field is @xmath27 times its maximal value , in the equatorial plane.,width=453 ]    with this definition of the radius , it is possible to define the compactness of the objects , by just taking the adimensional ratio @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the standard adm mass of the boson stars .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : comp ] .",
    "first one can notice that the result depends very moderately on the value of @xmath13 .",
    "the variation of the mass and radius with @xmath13 almost cancel so that the compactness depends almost only on @xmath12 .",
    "one can also notice that it can reach very high values of the order unity ( remember that typical neutron stars have a compactness of about 0.2 ) , illustrating the fact that boson stars are indeed good black hole mimickers .",
    "let us also mention that spherically symmetric boson stars ( i.e. for which @xmath18 ) can only reach compactness of about @xmath30 . this is mainly due to the fact that they can not attain small enough values of @xmath12 , due to the turning point in the sequences ( see fig .",
    "[ f : rad ] for instance ) .",
    "compactness of the various boson stars.,width=453 ]",
    "given the high compactness of boson stars , there is a good hope that those objects could have some light rings .",
    "those are closed orbits of photons .",
    "mathematically speaking one needs to find closed null geodesics of the spacetime .",
    "given the fact that boson stars are axisymmetric objects , one looks for circular orbits in the equatorial plane , as in the case of a kerr black hole . in this work",
    "such orbits are localized using an effective potential method which proceeds as follows .",
    "let us call @xmath31 the tangent vector of a photon trajectory . as we consider only orbits in the equatorial plane",
    ", it reduces to @xmath32 .",
    "boson star spacetimes admit two independent killing vectors : @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "their existence leads to two conserved quantities along the geodesics , being the scalar products of @xmath31 with the two killing vectors :    u_(_t)^&= & (-n^2 + b^2 r^2 ^ 2 ) u^t + b^2 r^2 ^u^= e + u_(_)^&= & b^2 r^2 ^u^t + b^2 r^2 u^=",
    "l , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are two constants along the geodesic . from those equations",
    ", one can express the components @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as functions of @xmath35 and @xmath36 : [ e : ut ] u^t & = & + [ e : up ] u^&= & - (^l -e ) . injecting those expressions into the fact that the geodesic is null ( i.e. @xmath39 ) leads to an equation on @xmath40 .",
    "it can be put into the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an effective potential , given by    [ e : veff ] v_eff = [- + ] .",
    "circular orbits are such that @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the second condition is necessary to prevent being only at the periastron or the apoastron of an elliptic orbit .",
    "the first condition leads to [ e : esl ] = ^- , where @xmath45 .",
    "contrary to the massive particle case , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not constrained independently but only via their ratio .",
    "this is basically due to the fact that there is no scale of mass in the case of photons .",
    "the condition @xmath46 , along with @xmath43 leads to an equation involving the radius of the orbit and the various metric fields : i(r ) =  ( ) r^2 + (- ) r + = 0 .",
    "this is a purely radial equation ( remember one works in the equatorial plane ) but it is not a second order equation on @xmath47 , the various fields depending on @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ f : func ] shows the functions @xmath48 for two values of @xmath12 , in the case @xmath49 .",
