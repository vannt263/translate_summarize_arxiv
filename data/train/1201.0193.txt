    "there is a long - standing puzzle in hadronic spin physics , the inclusive production of highly polarized strange hyperons .",
    "the expectation from perturbative qcd based on the kane , pumplin , repko ( kpr ) calculation  @xcite was that such polarization should be small as governed by the quantity @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the effective mass of the strange quark ( or the hyperon ) that normalizes the helicity flip vertices , and @xmath2 a characteristic energy of the hard production process for the quark . to explain why measurements did not agree with the expectation , soft processes or semi - classical mechanisms of various kinds",
    "have been proposed over the years . to this end , dharmaratna and goldstein ( dg )",
    "@xcite calculated all the 4th order hard qcd amplitudes that enter in hadron+hadron collisions via parton+parton producing s - quark pairs or heavier flavors .",
    "they found that sizable polarizations , at the several percent level , were produced through interference between these amplitudes and tree level terms .",
    "the kinematic dependence of these results favored small @xmath3 .",
    "negative @xmath4 was linked to negative polarization .",
    "the gluon fusion mechanism produced the larger magnitude of polarization and is antisymmetric around the 90@xmath5 production in the g+g center of mass . if this hard process is the source of measured hyperon polarization , that polarization must be enhanced through soft process hadronization .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4 must be boosted to the forward region .",
    "it was posited that this was accomplished through recombination of the polarized quark with the diquark remnant of the beam proton . a simple ansatz for that soft process used the analogy with the  thomas precession \" mechanism  @xcite to boost the @xmath4(quark ) to @xmath4(hadron ) while enhancing the scale of the polarization by @xmath6 .",
    "this dg scheme explained the systematic behavior of @xmath7 and @xmath8 polarization .",
    "but it required this  recombination \" to enhance the s - quark polarization while realigning the kinematics .",
    "taken at face value it predicted  @xcite the behavior of the @xmath9 data from fermilab experiment e791",
    "the latter show increasing negative polarization for @xmath10 gev .",
    "this striking result awaits confirmation from higher energy collisions at the lhc .",
    "the attractive features of the dg  hybrid model \" suggest a more rigorous qcd based formulation . these will be elucidated below .",
    "first we consider the production of top quarks .",
    "the hard processes of gluon fusion and light quark pair annihilation as mechanisms to produce a heavy quark polarization were shown to reach the few percent level in the calculations of dg .",
    "these calculations were carried out to one loop order in qcd as necessary for non - zero polarization .",
    "for the c - quark and b - quark the polarization has to be carried through the hadronization , and hence soft processes will intervene to produce the polarized hadron . for * top quarks",
    "* , however , hadronization does not occur - the top decays weakly , but faster than hadronization times , primarily into @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the decay plane relative to the production plane is a measure of the polarization .",
    "preliminary calculations by goldstein and liuti are shown in fig .",
    "[ t - polzn ] .",
    "this figure shows that , remarkably , there can be up to 5% polarization over a very broad range of transverse momenta for lhc kinematics .",
    "qualitatively , the large top mass enhances the polarization overall .",
    "the falloff with the energy production scale is compensated by the large gluon production probability , especially at small values of @xmath12 .",
    "there is also a notable scaling up of the range of transverse momenta as the phase space becomes very large compared to fixed target kinematics .",
    "the net effect is that the gluon distribution functions contribute most to the smaller feynman x region .",
    "a measurement of this quantity will provide a good test of the pqcd hard production process , independent of soft rescattering effects .",
    "several directions are being pursued to explore the hyperon and heavy flavor baryon polarization phenomena as applied to lhc energies , where the @xmath13 mechanism is dominant , especially at small bjorken @xmath14 for both protons . to begin with",
    ", the leptoproduction framework is used in preparation for considering purely hadronic production .",
    "one approach is through the  fracture function \" picture of trentadue and veneziano  @xcite , as extended to include angular momentum dependences by sivers  @xcite .",
    "the fracture functions are joint probabilities that relate the beam direction hard scattered quark distribution from the target nucleon ( a function of @xmath12 ) to the baryon fragmentation of the target ( a function of @xmath15 ) . for a single spin asymmetry ( ssa )",
    "there must be an interference , which requires some process like a final state interaction .",
    "another approach is from the gpd perspective .",
    "the compton form factors derived from gpds have phases that will provide such interferences .",
    "we will illustrate both approaches .",
    "the fracture functions ( ff ) provide a qcd - based perspective on target fragmentation . in leptoproduction of hadrons ,",
    "the ff represents the joint probability for the emission from the hadronic target of a quark , antiquark or gluon at some @xmath16 along with the fragmentation of the target into a hadron of fractional momentum @xmath17 relative to the target energy in the virtual photon + target cm frame .",
    "this definition of @xmath15 establishes that for large @xmath15 the hadron is tracking the fragment of the target , _",
    "e.g. _ the diquark or spectator . formally , for a quark - nucleon ff , @xmath18 where transverse momenta @xmath19 are for the quark and the outgoing hadron , respectively . since we are interested in the unpolarized cross section or the transverse @xmath7 polarization , we keep the definition here in terms of diagonal helicities for the quark fields and the target nucleon , while allowing for change of helicity for the outgoing hadron",
    "it should be noted that there can be transverse polarization providing the @xmath7 has non - zero @xmath3 relative to the @xmath20 direction .",
    "this is possible , whether a current fragment is observed or not , because there is a hadronic plane established .",
    "this can be a leading twist result ( although outside the scope of the thorough formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by analogy with the ref .  @xcite for semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , in which a soft gluon exchange provides the necessary phase .",
    "we evaluate the behavior of ffs in describing leptoproduction of polarized hyperons within the spectator model - the diquark spectator model  @xcite .",
    "this model has provided a successful beginning in qualitatively describing a large array of phenomena .",
    "we first consider a ff at the tree level for the process @xmath21 where the @xmath22-quark hadronizes and @xmath23 contains unmeasured , inclusive hadrons . in the spectator model for the nucleon to a light quark transition ,",
    "the spectator is the ( uu ) or ( ud ) diquark .",
    "we take a scalar diquark to begin with , ( ud+du ) .",
    "then we can write a form in which the struck u - quark ( with @xmath14 and @xmath24 ) leaves the diquark ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) to fragment into the @xmath7 ( with @xmath15 and @xmath3 ) .",
    "the flavor labels have been ignored . obviously , for polarized @xmath7 production , those labels are crucial .",
    "it is also important to note that gauge links have to be carefully implemented for consistency .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as final state interactions , via the mechanism of ref .",
    "in fact , to obtain polarization in this picture requires some means to generate a phase difference between interfering helicity flip and non - flip amplitudes . as sivers has noted  @xcite , there has to be a means to generate a ",
    "boer - mulders \" ff or a  polarizing \" ff in order to have an unpolarized target yield a polarized @xmath7 .",
    "the mechanism we will consider is illustrated by having an additional gluon exchange as in the upper right diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig4_ff ] connecting the outgoing parton to the spectator or the fragmenting inclusive state @xmath23 .    at tree level",
    "the calculation of the cross section is straightforward . to approximate all of those states and in keeping with the spectator approach ,",
    "we take x to be a single mass @xmath27 anti - s quark .",
    "then there is the condition that @xmath28 . given this condition we have the diquark momentum @xmath29 and the quark momentum @xmath30 constrained to be @xmath31 the struck quark with momentum @xmath32 leads to @xmath33 .",
    "the unpolarized fracture function is evaluated in this model by summing over the unobservable helicities and integrating over 4-momentum @xmath34 . if the struck quark is not  observed \" , _",
    "i.e. _ its fragmentation is not measured , the @xmath35 can be set to 0 without loss of generality .",
    "then we have the resulting fracture function @xmath36 , shown for two values of @xmath3 in fig .  [ fig4_ff ] , left .",

    "there are two ways the final state interaction can occur at order @xmath38 .",
    "the color non - singlet diquark can absorb the soft gluon from the struck quark or the fragment remnant from the @xmath7 production with anti - s - quark quantum numbers can absorb the soft gluon .",
    "this is shown in the upper right fig .",
