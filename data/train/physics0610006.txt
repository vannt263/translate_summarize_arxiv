    "nearly all digital signal - measuring equipment found in laboratories throughout the world , from the humble voltmeter up to powerful computerized data - logging systems and high - frequency digitizing scopes , operate with an internal master clock that sets the pace for an analog - to - digital converter that translates the electrical output of a transducer into a bit pattern .",
    "the master clock frequency is usually held as stable as possible and the sample intervals are fixed to a very high degree of precision .",
    "correspondingly , most signal - analysis techniques are meant to be used on evenly spaced data : this is true for the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) and also for autoregressive ( ar ) or moving average ( ma ) modeling of data @xcite .",
    "however some data happen to be unevenly sampled : this is especially true for astronomers , who are seldom so lucky as to have an uninterrupted series of clear nights , and in general are bound to observe whatever comes from the sky , whenever it comes , and have to search for periodicities amid these scattered data .",
    "indeed it was the astronomical community that developed the first effective spectral estimation techniques for unevenly sampled data @xcite .",
    "uneven sampling has special properties : beutler proved rigorously @xcite that in general uneven sampling is not band - limited and later showed that a random , poisson - distributed set of sampling times allows perfect signal reconstruction @xcite .",
    "earlier , yen @xcite was able to derive modified forms of the shannon reconstruction formula for different types of uneven sampling , which are however much more complex than the corresponding formula for even sampling . and",
    "indeed , randomly sampled signals are not easy to analyze and",
    "many standard methods must be abandoned , although in some cases one can restore regular sampling using reconstruction algorithms @xcite .    since no sampling clock is quite perfect and is normally affected by noise @xcite and by deterministic drifts ( that may be periodic ) , all regular sampling should actually be regarded as quasi - regular sampling .",
    "ignoring this may be dangerous , because it is clear that quasi - regular sampling of a deterministic signal ( e.g. a sinusoidal signal ) may introduce unwanted harmonics in the dft analysis of the sampled signal , unless corrective measures are taken .",
    "but what happens if one samples pure noise ?",
    "can one still produce artifacts ? if this were the case then an unrecognized quasi - regular sampling of a noisy background might become a problem since it would produce fake signals that could be mistaken for true . in this paper",
    "i show that this is just what happens in some cases of colored noise , i.e. , in the case of the long - memory noise processes @xmath0 with @xmath1 , while the correlation between samples for noises with @xmath2 is insufficient to produce replicas of the low - frequency peak of the noise spectrum . a proof is given in section [ proof1 ] , while section [ sim ] illustrates numerical results that confirm the theoretical analysis , and section [ disc ] discusses some implications of these findings .",
    "it is well known that a signal sampled @xmath3 times in the time interval @xmath4 can be modeled by a sum of @xmath3 exponentials and that this is equivalent to a dft : in other words the dft is a physical model of the signal @xcite and we can write : @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the @xmath7-th sample , and the fit coefficients @xmath8 correspond to the dft and can be calculated from the formula @xmath9 with the usual regular sampling intervals @xmath10 , the @xmath7-th sampling time is @xmath11 , the total sampling time is @xmath12 , and equation ( [ dft ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath13 if sampling is not quite regular , the sampling times @xmath14 are replaced by @xmath15 , and equation ( [ dft2 ] ) becomes @xmath16 now we assume a periodic sampling pattern with a period equal to @xmath17 clock ticks , so that @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; we also assume at first that @xmath20 is an integer ( numerical simulations show that this requirement can be relaxed and @xmath20 can be real ) and we expand the relative timing shift @xmath21 as a fourier sum : @xmath22 and in addition , we assume the relative timing shifts to be very small , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "next we notice that @xmath24 , and then , using equations ( [ dft2uneven ] ) and ( [ rts ] ) and after a few cumbersome but straightforward passages , we can approximate the observed dft with the following formula : @xmath25 moreover if we make the rather weak assumption that the phase of the noise dft in different frequency bins is uncorrelated so that @xmath26 if @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the usual ensemble average , then the dft ( [ obsdft ] ) gives the following spectrum : @xmath29 ( the hypothesis of phase independence is quite common , because it is essential for noise generators like that of timmer and knig @xcite , and is supported by the numerical results reported in @xcite ) .    if the noise is white , i.e. , the spectral density is flat , or if it is a @xmath0 noise with a spectral index @xmath30 , we see from eq .",
    "( [ obspsd ] ) that the periodic uneven sampling amounts to the addition of a ( small ) non - flat background .",
    "in fact a @xmath0 noise has a discrete spectrum @xmath31 , therefore the observed spectrum ( [ obspsd ] ) becomes @xmath32 however , if the spectral index @xmath33 is greater than 2 , then the @xmath34-th harmonic of the relative time shift @xmath21 produces a peak over the power - law background , which is just the low - frequency noise peak , shifted to the @xmath35-th frequency bin .",
    "the analysis that leads to eq .",
    "( [ obspsd ] ) assumes small relative timing shifts , but in this section i report numerical simulations carried out with the exact power - law noise generator described in @xcite that do support the analytical results also for large relative timing shifts @xcite .",
    "the generator used in the simulation runs produces power - law noise from a superposition of random exponential pulses , and is exact in the sense that it produces a process that is theoretically guaranteed to yield a range - limited power - law spectrum between two extreme ( angular ) frequencies @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the generator takes correctly into account the correlation between samples in colored noises , and works also with unevenly spaced sampling times .    in these simulations , time is in arbitrary units , and the average sampling interval is @xmath38 arb .",
    "units ; the choice of time units also sets the corresponding frequency units used for the relaxation rates @xmath39 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a simulated signal obtained with the noise generator for a @xmath40 noise ; in this case the generator parameters are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , i.e. , the spectrum has a power - law region @xmath40 that spans the frequency interval @xmath44 , and the pulse rate has been set at @xmath45 pulses per unit time , so that the resulting noise signal is gaussian to a very high degree @xcite . in this case the sampling time has been sinusoidally modulated : @xmath46 ( the period for uneven sampling is 4 samples ) , and there are in all @xmath47 samples . figure [ fig2 ] shows the dft spectrum of the signal of figure ( [ fig1 ] ) : a comparison with the exact theoretical spectrum of the noise generator @xcite @xmath48\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]  which has a @xmath0 power - law in the range @xmath49  shows that on the whole the sampled noise process produced by the noise generator actually behaves as predicted by theory @xcite , except for a small peak at the frequency of the sampling time modulation .",
    "this small peak only shows up in this and in other runs ( not shown here , but easily reproducible @xcite ) with @xmath1 , and this lends support to the proofs of the previous sections .",
    "the spectra shown in this and in the other figures have been partly detrended with a hanning window ( a general introduction to the need of the detrending step can be found , e.g. , in @xcite ; see also the qualitative considerations in @xcite ) .    a closer look at the modulation peaks yields however a much more striking confirmation of the analytical results : in fact the theoretical spectral density ( [ psdplaw ] ) of the noise generator has a @xmath0 power - law region for @xmath49 , while for @xmath50 it has a @xmath51 behavior , and this means that from equation ( [ obspsd ] ) we expect that the correction term due to uneven sampling is negligible just at the modulation frequency , while there should be two side - peaks whose exact shape depends on the low - frequency limit of the @xmath0 region , i.e. , on @xmath36 . and",
    "indeed this is just what happens in the simulations , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] , where part * a. * shows the region of the averaged spectrum in figure [ fig2]b close to the peak due to sampling time modulation .",
    "figure [ fig3]b shows the expected behavior calculated from equation ( [ obspsd ] ) and from the conditions used in the generation of the noise process and listed above ( the correction for the incoherent gain of the hanning window is also included ) . finally , figure [ fig3]c is the superposition of parts [ fig3]a and [ fig3]c , where we see that the calculated shape closely matches the observed shape",
    ".    figure [ fig4 ] shows the results of a similar calculation performed on the spectrum of a single realization of the noise process shown in figure [ fig2]a : figure [ fig4]a is the zoomed portion of the spectrum around the modulation peak .",
    "figure [ fig4]b is a still closer zoom , and the arrow in the figure shows the position of the modulation frequency : notice that there is no peak just where one would naively expect to find one . the low frequency part of the spectrum in figure [ fig2]a has been inserted in equation ( [ obspsd ] ) to obtain the spectrum in figure [ fig4]c , and we see that there is an almost perfect correspondence with the peak in figure [ fig4]c : this means that the correlation terms between different frequencies ( the cross - terms in the derivation of equation ( [ obspsd ] ) ) are negligible even for a single realization of the noise process .",
    "i have also noted that there must be a dependence of the split - peak shape on the exact shape of the low - frequency part of the spectrum : figure [ fig5]a shows the shape of the peak for a larger value of @xmath36 ( @xmath52 ) . in this case",
    "the low - frequency part of the noise spectrum ( [ psdplaw ] ) has a wider @xmath51 region , and the side - peaks must be correspondingly lower and further apart : indeed this is just what happens in figure [ fig5]a . a further confirmation is provided by figure [ fig5]b , which shows the peak for a smaller value of @xmath36 ( @xmath53 ) : the side - peaks are much higher and also closer .",
    "while most of the observed power - law ( @xmath0 ) noises have spectral indexes @xmath54 , with an apparent clustering around @xmath55 , red noises , i.e. , noises with spectral indexes @xmath1 , also show up in several unrelated systems @xcite like the water level of the nile river , economics , orchid population size @xcite and local temperature fluctuations and affect precise timekeeping @xcite and our ability to predict environmental and animal population variables @xcite .",
    "noises with @xmath1 also appear in the energy level fluctuations of quantum systems @xcite and in timing noise in pulsars @xcite .",
    "because of their extreme peaking behavior at low frequencies these noises are also called `` black '' @xcite , and they display marked persistence properties @xcite that may lead to the mistaken identification of underlying trends in experimental data @xcite . from the results reported in this paper",
    "it follows that these noises pose yet another potential danger to experiments that use uneven sampling , because their long - memory properties give rise to artifacts in the dft spectra",
    ".    however equation ( [ obspsd ] ) also shows that the single peak  in the case of true @xmath0 noise  or the side - peaks  in the case of range - limited @xmath0 noise  can be modulated both in amplitude and in frequency by modulating either the noise spectrum or the relative timing shift amplitude , or the repetition index @xmath20 : this means that uneven sampling of colored noise could be utilized to encode information , and since an encoding noise appears at first sight just ordinary noise , this could be used to implement a secure communication channel ( there is a very rich literature on this topic , but here i give only a reference to a classic book @xcite and to a recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "a simple example of the kind of modulation that can be achieved can be gleaned from figures [ fig3 ] , [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] : if one uses the noise generator @xcite , it is possible to modulate the shape of the low - frequency part of the spectrum with a proper change of @xmath36 and in this way one modulates in turn both the amplitude and the position , i.e. , the frequency , of the side peaks .",
    "all the simulations reported here have been produced with a slightly modified version of the example program in the _ plnoise _ noise generator described in @xcite and @xcite and available from the cpc program library : http://www.cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk / cpc/. the main change in that code amounts to the substitution of the instruction that advances time at each sampling step                                         this figure show a noise signal produced with the generator described in @xcite .",
    "the parameters in this specific run are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , i.e. , the spectrum has a power - law region @xmath40 that spans the angular frequency interval @xmath56 .",
    "the generator produces power - law noise from a superposition of random exponential pulses , and in this run the pulse rate has been set at @xmath45 pulses per unit time , so that the resulting noise signal is gaussian to a very high degree @xcite .",
    "time is in arbitrary units , and the average sampling interval is @xmath38 ( arb .",

    "part * a*. shows the whole signal generated in this run ( time does not start from zero , because at the beginning some samples are used for the generator initialization and are discarded ) ; part * b*. shows the initial 32768 valid samples .",
