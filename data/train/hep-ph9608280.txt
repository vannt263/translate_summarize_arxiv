    "the electroweak interaction is a gauge theory , with the gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to that of electromagnetism .",
    "a major outstanding problem in particle physics is to discover the mechanism which breaks the symmetry .",
    "the simplest model of the symmetry - breaking mechanism is the standard higgs model , in which a fundamental scalar field acquires a vacuum - expectation value @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "the particle content of the model is a spin - zero boson , dubbed the higgs boson ( @xmath3 ) , and three massless goldstone bosons ( @xmath4 ) which are ultimately absorbed by the weak gauge bosons .",
    "it has been established that the standard higgs model exists only up to a cutoff energy @xmath5 at or before which the model must be subsumed by a more fundamental theory  @xcite .",
    "thus the standard higgs model is regarded as an effective field theory , valid for energies less than @xmath5 .",
    "the maximal allowed value of @xmath5 decreases with increasing higgs mass , @xmath6 . demanding , for consistency , that @xmath7 leads to an upper bound on the higgs mass  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of whether the standard higgs model can be strongly interacting at energies and higgs masses less than the cutoff @xmath5 . by `` strongly interacting '' we mean that the higgs self - coupling , @xmath8 , is so large that perturbation theory is unreliable .",
    "there are two scenarios which yield a large value for the higgs coupling : ( i ) the running coupling @xmath0 increases with increasing scale @xmath9 , leading to a strong coupling at energies above the higgs mass ; ( ii ) a higgs mass , @xmath6 , much larger than the vacuum - expectation value , @xmath10 gev , results in a large coupling @xmath11 .",
    "since the higgs model is constrained by the cutoff @xmath5 , the two possibilities lead to the following questions :    * can the running coupling @xmath0 become strong for energies @xmath12 in the range @xmath13 ? * can @xmath14 be strong for values of the higgs mass @xmath6 below the cutoff @xmath5",
    "?    the first question is related to high - energy processes such as higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering",
    ". the second question can be investigated in the context of higgs - boson decays .",
    "since both of these processes have been calculated at next - to - next - to - leading order in perturbation theory , they are appropriate indicators of the reliability of perturbation theory .",
    "a popular way to model the cutoff @xmath5 is to use a lattice with a finite lattice spacing @xmath15 @xcite . for a review of early work",
    ", we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas a more current set of references is given in , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite . using such an approach ,",
    "the cutoff @xmath5 is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "when lattice - spacing effects on physical quantities are small , the model is equivalent to the standard higgs model in the continuum .",
    "when lattice - spacing effects are large , the standard higgs model ceases to exist as an effective field theory .",
    "this observation can be used to establish an upper bound on the higgs mass .    using the condition that the inverse lattice spacing be greater than twice the higgs mass ( @xmath17 ) , lscher and weisz @xcite determined an upper bound on @xmath14 of 3.2 , corresponding to an upper bound on the higgs mass of 630 gev . a subsequent study @xcite found a similar upper bound on @xmath14 .",
    "alternative formulations of the lattice action can increase the bound slightly @xcite .",
    "lscher and weisz argued that perturbation theory is reliable for a higgs coupling of @xmath18 .",
    "they based their statement on observations regarding three perturbative observables : ( i ) such a value of @xmath14 yields a perturbative higgs width which is much less than its mass , ( ii ) two - loop perturbative cross sections at threshold in the symmetric phase of the model are apparently convergent for such a coupling , and ( iii ) this coupling is less than the perturbative unitarity bound ( or the higgs mass ) , but rather the value above which the coupling is strong .",
    "in contrast , the lattice bound on the coupling is truly a bound , in the sense that the standard higgs model can not exist as an effective field theory if the coupling exceeds this value . ] on @xmath8 .",
    "they therefore concluded that there is no strongly - interacting higgs model in which the cutoff is substantially greater than the higgs mass .",
    "recent perturbative studies of high - energy higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering in the broken phase of the model have led to a different conclusion @xcite .",
    "considering the high - energy limit , the relevant coupling of these observables is the running coupling @xmath0 , where @xmath9 is of the order of the center - of - mass energy , @xmath12 . using a variety of criteria",
    ", all high - energy studies found that the two - loop high - energy perturbative amplitudes do not converge satisfactorily for @xmath19 .",
    "for example , durand , lopez , and johnson argued that perturbation theory is unreliable for @xmath20 as low as @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was based on a one - loop analysis of partial - wave unitarity in higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering , and on the lack of convergence of the perturbation series .",
    "using a variety of additional criteria to judge the convergence of the perturbative series , subsequent analyses at two loops have only served to reinforce this conclusion @xcite . since the running coupling @xmath22 can attain a value of @xmath23 for values of @xmath24 , the standard higgs model could be strongly interacting at energies above the higgs mass but below the cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "in this paper we reinvestigate the perturbative behaviour of the high - energy higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering .",
    "we introduce a summation procedure which shifts the value of the coupling at which perturbation theory becomes unreliable to @xmath25 . requiring that the energy @xmath12 be less than the cutoff @xmath5 , the perturbative bound @xmath25 is large enough to ensure the absence of a strongly - interacting higgs sector at high energies .",
    "thus our summation procedure restores the convergence of perturbation theory at energies above the higgs mass but below the cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "this is a new result , and complements the result of lscher and weisz on the impossibility of a strong higgs coupling at @xmath26 .",
    "we conclude that the possibility of a strongly - interacting standard higgs model is eliminated at all energies .",
    "our summation procedure is based on identifying a certain class of feynman diagrams which can be summed by an appropriate scale @xmath9 in the running coupling @xmath0 . calculating high - energy higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering ,",
    "all previous analyses have implicitly or explicitly chosen @xmath27 @xcite , or have varied the scale about this value @xcite .",
    "we argue that a better scale is @xmath28 .",
    "this scale corresponds to a summation of a universal nonlogarithmic term which accompanies the leading logarithms in the higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering diagrams .",
    "we show that this summation greatly improves the convergence of perturbation theory : the coefficients of the perturbative series are greatly reduced as seen up to two loops , and the scale dependence is significantly reduced when varying @xmath9 around @xmath29 ( rather than @xmath12 ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we reanalyse higgs- and goldstone - boson scattering up to two loops , and argue for the appropriate scale @xmath9 in the running coupling @xmath0 .",
