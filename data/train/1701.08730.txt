    "particle production at forward rapidity in high energy proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions has been the subject of numerous studies aiming at improving our understanding of saturation dynamics .",
    "indeed , these processes probe the target proton or nucleus at very small @xmath0 which is where saturation effects should be enhanced .",
    "two important examples of such processes are light hadron and quarkonium production , for which it was shown that saturation could provide an explanation for the nuclear suppression observed at the lhc  @xcite",
    ". however , these processes are also sensitive to fragmentation and final state effects . in this respect",
    ", drell - yan production appears as a much cleaner probe of initial state effects in hadronic collisions . in particular",
    ", it was recently suggested that the ratio of the nuclear modification factors of @xmath1 and drell - yan production could be used as a way to distinguish between various approaches , based on either initial or final state effects , that can describe the rapidity dependence of the nuclear modification of forward @xmath1 production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one of the main motivations of the present work is to make predictions for this observable in the saturation approach . for this",
    ", we will first study the nuclear modification of forward drell - yan production at the lhc using the dipole correlators introduced in ref .",
    "the comparison of these results with future measurements of this observable would provide an additional test for these correlators which have been shown to lead to a rather good agreement with experimental data on the nuclear modification of single inclusive forward hadron  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite production .",
    "such a measurement could be performed at the alice or lhcb experiments at the lhc in the near future .",
    "the study of the drell - yan process in the color dipole approach has been the subject of many theoretical and phenomenological works , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the physical picture is the following : a collinear quark emitted by the projectile proton can radiate a virtual photon either before or after interacting with the dense color field of the target .",
    "this virtual photon then decays into a dilepton pair .",
    "these two contributions are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : diags_sat ] . in collinear factorization ,",
    "contributions where the gluon density of the target is probed start to appear only at next - to - leading order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diags_coll ] ) .",
    "however , in the kinematics considered here these contributions are enhanced by the strong rise of gluon densities at small @xmath0 . using similar notations as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dilepton pair production cross section can be written , in the limit of massless quarks , as    @xmath2 \\ ! \\bigg [ & 2m^2(1-\\alpha)^2 \\left(\\frac{{\\cal i}_1}{p_\\perp^2+\\varepsilon^2}-\\frac { { \\cal i}_2}{4\\varepsilon } \\right )   \\\\ \\nonumber & + [ 1+(1-\\alpha)^2]\\left ( \\frac{\\varepsilon \\ , p_\\perp \\ , { \\cal i}_3}{p_\\perp^2+\\varepsilon^2 } -\\frac{{\\cal i}_1}{2}+\\frac{\\varepsilon \\,{\\cal i}_2}{4}\\right ) \\ !",

    "@xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 read @xmath12        the description of the projectile proton in terms of collinear quark distributions @xmath13 is justified by the fact that the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath14 at which it is probed is not very small at forward rapidity . on the other hand , the target",
    "is probed at very small @xmath15 and it can thus be described in terms of classical color fields .",
    "the information about its gluon density is contained in the dipole scattering amplitude @xmath16 , which is related to @xmath17 , the fundamental representation dipole correlator in the color field of the target : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a fundamental representation wilson line in the color field of the target . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath15 is taken as @xmath20 a more detailed treatment of the kinematics taking into account the unobserved outgoing quark leads to @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transverse momentum of the outgoing quark .",
    "therefore  ( [ eq : x2_min ] ) is strictly speaking the minimal value allowed for @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not possible to use  ( [ eq : x2_exact ] ) directly since @xmath22 has already been integrated over to arrive at eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsigma ] ) . to estimate the importance of the choice of @xmath15",
    ", we will use both  ( [ eq : x2_min ] ) and an effective value @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the saturation scale of the target ( we use the same definition of the saturation scale as in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. @xmath24 is defined as the solution of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : x2_eff ] ) is motivated by the fact that on average the total transverse momentum provided by the target should be of the order of its saturation scale .         in this work",
    "we use the dipole correlators introduced in ref .",
    "the rapidity ( or @xmath0 ) evolution of @xmath17 is obtained by solving numerically the balitsky - kovchegov equation with running coupling corrections  @xcite . in the case of a proton target",
    ", the initial condition at @xmath26 is parametrized as @xmath27 , \\ ] ] and it is assumed that there is no impact parameter dependence in @xmath17 , therefore when computing proton - proton cross sections we make the replacement @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the effective proton transverse area .",

    "because of the lack of accurate nuclear dis data at small @xmath0 a similar fit can not be performed for a nuclear target .",

    "@xmath41 is fixed so that the distribution is normalized to unity .",
    "the other parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ica ] ) take the same values as in the case of a proton target . because @xmath17 now depends on @xmath7",
    "we integrate explicitly eq .",
    "( [ eq : dsigma ] ) over the impact parameter when computing proton - nucleus cross sections . at the edge of the nucleus , which is too dilute for our formalism to be reliable",
    ", we use the proton - proton result scaled such that the nuclear modification factor is unity .",
    "we emphasize that in this model , besides the standard woods - saxon transverse thickness function @xmath37 , no new parameters are introduced when going from proton - proton to proton - nucleus collisions .",
    "using , in contrast to e.g.  @xcite , these proton and nucleus dipole correlators already used for light hadron  @xcite and @xmath1  @xcite production leads to a rather precise prediction for the nuclear modification factor of forward drell - yan production at the lhc as will be shown in the next section .",
    "tev . ]     tev . ]    in this section we present our results for the cross section and nuclear modification factor of forward drell - yan production at the lhc at a center of mass energy @xmath42 tev .",
    "since saturation effects should be strongest at low @xmath15 values , we consider small invariant masses in the range @xmath43 .",
    "this low mass region was shown to be accessible experimentally at lhcb  @xcite .",
    "the effect of using either the definition  ( [ eq : x2_min ] ) or  ( [ eq : x2_eff ] ) for @xmath15 as well as varying the factorization scale @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is shown as an uncertainty band .",
    "we use the leading order mstw2008 parametrization  @xcite to describe the quark densities in the projectile proton , taking into account the three light flavors .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_pp_y ] we show the proton - proton cross section as a function of rapidity integrated over @xmath47 up to 15 gev .",
    "we observe a rather large uncertainty due both to the choice of @xmath15 and @xmath44 .",
    "in particular , different choices for @xmath44 can lead to different trends : while the choice @xmath48 leads to a generally increasing cross section as a function of @xmath3 , the other extreme choice @xmath49 leads to a generally decreasing cross section .",
    "this is due to the behavior of quark densities in the projectile . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_pp_pt ] we also show the @xmath47 spectrum in proton - proton collisions integrated over rapidity in the range @xmath50 .",
    "while the absolute cross section can be quite sensitive to scale variations , the nuclear modification factor is in general a more robust observable .",
    "indeed , normalization uncertainties will cancel to some extent in this ratio defined as @xmath51 this is indeed the case here , as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig : rpa_y ] and  [ fig : rpa_pt ] where we show the nuclear modification factor for drell - yan production as a function of rapidity and transverse momentum respectively .",
    "therefore , this observable could provide an interesting test of the formalism used here and it could for example be measured at lhcb in the near future  @xcite .    beyond the interest for drell - yan production itself , the values of the nuclear modification factor presented here can be compared with the results obtained for other processes in the same formalism , such as forward @xmath1 production .",
    "indeed , it was recently suggested  @xcite that the ratio @xmath52 could be used to disentangle between several approaches which are compatible with the rapidity dependence of the nuclear modification of @xmath1 production at the lhc . computing this ratio , using the same dipole correlators as in refs .",
    "@xcite for consistency , is therefore one of the main objectives of the present work .",
    "the variation of this ratio as a function of the rapidity of the lepton pair is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio_jpsi_dy ] .",
    "one can observe that this ratio is rather flat and close to unity .",
    "this was to be expected since in this formalism the description of the target in terms of an unintegrated gluon distribution is the same for these two processes and this unintegrated gluon distribution is probed at similar values of @xmath15 .    while the results shown here for @xmath52 can not be directly compared with those shown in ref .",
    "@xcite because of the different center of mass energies and dilepton invariant mass ranges considered , it is interesting to note that the behaviour of this ratio as a function of rapidity can be very different depending on the approach followed . in collinear factorization , at leading order @xmath1 production probes the gluon density of the target while drell - yan production involves the quark distributions . because the nuclear pdfs are still not yet strongly constrained by data , the predictions for the ratio @xmath52 in this approach show a relatively wide spread compatible with values close to unity  @xcite , as are the results presented here .",
    "the contrast is much more drastic when comparing with the results obtained in the coherent energy loss model  @xcite , in which this ratio decreases quickly as the rapidity increases  @xcite .",
    "therefore , this observable could help to discriminate between approaches based on the modification of parton densities on one hand and on medium - induced radiation on the other hand .",
    "more generally , an accurate measurement of the nuclear modification of forward drell - yan production at the lhc would provide valuable information on parton densities at small @xmath0 in a nucleus which could be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions made either in the color dipole approach or in collinear factorization .",
    "tev . ]     tev . ]",
    "in this work we have studied forward drell - yan production in high energy proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc in the color dipole formalism , using for the description of the dense target the same dipole correlators as in refs .",
    "in particular , we used the optical glauber model to obtain the dipole correlator of a nucleus from the one of a proton .",
    "this avoids the need to introduce new free parameters to describe a nuclear target .",
    "this approach was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite to lead to a rather good agreement with experimental measurements of the nuclear modification of forward light hadron and @xmath1 production .",
    "the comparison of the nuclear modification factors presented here with future measurements would provide an additional test for these correlators , which are assumed to be process - independent .",
    "in addition , using the same dipole correlators as in refs .",
    "@xcite allowed us to compute consistently the ratio @xmath52 , which was recently proposed as a way to distinguish between several approaches that can describe the nuclear modification of @xmath1 production at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "an experimental determination of this ratio would therefore be extremely valuable to better understand @xmath1 suppression in high energy proton - nucleus collisions .     and drell - yan production as a function of rapidity at a center of mass energy @xmath42 tev .",
