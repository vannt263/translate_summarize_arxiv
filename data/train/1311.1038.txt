    "<S> the rate of oxygen formation determines the c / o ratio during stellar helium burning . it is the single most important nuclear input of stellar evolution theory including the evolution of type ii and type ia supernova . </S>",

    "<S> our analysis of the angular distributions measured with the eurogam / gandi arrays leads to considerably larger error bars than published which excludes them from the current sample of `` world data '' . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the current sample of `` world data '' of the measured @xmath4 cross section factors below 1.7 mev cluster into two distinct groups that lead to two distinct extrapolations of @xmath5 or @xmath6 kevb . </S>",
    "<S> we point to a much neglected discrepancy between the measured @xmath7 phase difference ( @xmath8 ) and unitarity as required by the watson theorem , suggesting systematic problem(s ) in some of the measured gamma - ray angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the ambiguity of the extrapolated @xmath9 together with a previously observed ambiguity of @xmath10 represent the current state of the art of the field . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies must be resolved by future measurements of complete and detailed angular distributions of the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction at very low energies ( @xmath12 mev ) .    </S>",

    "<S> is synthesized by the so called `` triple alpha process '' but at the same time carbon is also destroyed by fusing with an additional alpha - particle to form @xmath13o in the @xmath1c@xmath2o reaction . hence the formation of oxygen in stellar helium burning determines the c / o ratio ; an essential parameter in stellar evolution theory @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) ( a ) the measured angular distribution of the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction @xcite together with the e1 + e2 fits for three values of the e2/e1 ratio as discussed in the text . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) the reduced @xmath14 obtained for different e2/e1 ratios.,width=336 ]    the importance of the c / o ratio for the evolution of massive stars ( @xmath15 ) that evolve to core collapse ( type ii ) supernova has been discussed extensively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently it was shown that the c / o ratio is also important for understanding the @xmath16ni mass fraction produced by lower mass stars ( @xmath17 ) that evolve into type ia supernova ( sneia ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the c / o ratio is also important for understanding the light curve of sneia . </S>",
    "<S> such sneia are used as cosmological `` standard candles '' with which the accelerated expansion of the universe and dark energy were recently discovered @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> stellar evolution theory requires the knowledge of the c / o ratio with an uncertainty of 5% . </S>",
    "<S> this requires accurate measurements at low energies and extrapolation of the measured astrophysical cross section factors to the gamow window at 300 kev @xcite . since mainly two ( @xmath18 = 1 and @xmath18 = 2 ) partial waves contribute to the reaction , accurate angular distribution data are needed at low energies to determine with high accuracy the astrophysical cross section factors @xmath10 and @xmath9 defined in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this goal has not been achieved as yet .    recently some of the most impressive gamma - ray measurements of the @xmath1c@xmath2o reaction were published @xcite including measurements of complete angular distribution at center of mass energies approaching 1.0 mev . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements employ large luminosities of the order of 10@xmath19 with integrated luminosities close to one inverse fb . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and a large ( so called @xmath20 ) array of gamma - ray detectors ( but some of the arrays employ low efficiency hpge detectors which led in some cases to insufficient counting statistics ) . </S>",
    "<S> such unprecedented data with unprecedented characteristics led to an expectation of a resolution of the long ( now forty years old ) debate on the value of the low energy cross section of the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction . while these data did not resolve the outstanding questions they provide the first possible detailed study of the cross section of the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction at low energies approaching 1.0 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we analyze and critically review these new measurements of angular distributions of gamma - rays from the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we focus our attention on angular distribution data in order to reveal trends in the cross section factors measured at the current lowest energies . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we study the @xmath4 cross section factors ( @xmath21 ) measured at energies ( @xmath22 ) below 1.7 mev in order to avoid the energy region where higher lying ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) states dominate and to be most sensitive to the bound @xmath24 state at 6.917 mev in @xmath13o that governs the @xmath4 cross section at stellar burning energies . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the `` world data '' on @xmath21 below 1.7 mev cluster into two groups that differ by an average factor of 2.6 and consequently these data extrapolate to two distinct solutions of @xmath5 or @xmath6 kevb . the ambiguity in the value of the extrapolated </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 resembles the previously observed ambiguity in the value of the extrapolated @xmath10 where the small value solution of the e1 cross section factor [ @xmath25 kevb ] can not be ruled out @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> and we point out a much neglected disagreement of the measured @xmath7 relative phase angle ( @xmath8 ) with unitarity which together with the major disagreement on the value of the `` cascade cross section '' @xcite defines the major challenges facing future measurements in this field .    </S>",
    "<S> we will describe the stringent requirements needed in future studies ( see for example @xcite ) in order to resolve these ambiguities . </S>",
    "<S> the exact values and energy dependence of @xmath21 and @xmath26 are essential for extrapolating the proposed measurements of the total reaction cross section to 300 kev ( see for example @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyzed all the published angular distributions measured at low energy ( @xmath27 mev ) with the gandi / eurogam array at stuttgart @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we employed the standard legendre polynomial expansion as for example shown in equation 4.3 of @xcite and we used the published angular attenuation coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distributions measured at 891 kev and 903 kev , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 of @xcite , were not included in our analysis since the data point were measured with error bars nearly 100% ( or larger ) . in order to simplify the analysis we fixed the relative angle ( @xmath8 ) at the value predicted by equ . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) discussed below , and we varied only one parameter ( @xmath28 ) apart from an over all normalization .    as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 the @xmath29 ratio at 1.342 mev can be varied by a factor as large as six and still yield a similar quality fit , with only a slight increase in @xmath30 from 1.8 to 2.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the same figure demonstrates that the data points measured at backward angles ( larger than @xmath31 ) provide the largest sensitivity to the @xmath29 ratio , but these few ( three ) data points are measured with poor precision considerably worst than 10% . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that precise data ( 5 - 10% statistics ) measured with small angular bins ( 10@xmath32 or smaller ) at large backward angles ( @xmath33 ) are essential for an accurate determination of the @xmath34 and @xmath4 cross section factors .    the @xmath35 values shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , when multiplied by 2.57 , yields a good fit ( @xmath43 0.75 ) to the data of kunz _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite and oulellet _ et al . _ </S>",

    "<S> such a large difference is clearly not expected due to the 54 kev difference in energy where these two angular distribution were measured and indicates a major systematic problem . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , these recent angular distributions @xcite are the most accurate data available today on the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction at low energy , but the two different extrapolated values do not allow us to determine @xmath9 with the required accuracy of 10% or better .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that current `` world data '' on @xmath21 extracted from angular distributions measured at energies below 1.7 mev cluster into two distinct groups leading to two different extrapolations of @xmath5 or @xmath6 kevb . </S>",

    "<S> 1 the data at large backward angles are most sensitive to the @xmath29 ratio , but such measurements with gamma - ray detectors are challenged by the finite size of the gamma - ray detector and the presence of the beam pipe .    the ambiguity in the value of the extrapolated @xmath9 , reported in this paper for the first time , resembles the ambiguity in the value of the extrapolated @xmath10 value where even the data on the beta - decay of @xmath13n shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 18 ( and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 16 ) of @xcite reveal two minima with identical @xmath48 values at @xmath49 10 kevb and @xmath50 80 kevb . </S>",
    "<S> the small value of the extrapolated @xmath51 kevb has been discussed by many authors @xcite and can not be resolved by the modern data as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 of @xcite . in order to resolve this ambiguity in the value of @xmath10 the newly proposed experiments @xcite must measure complete gamma - ray angular distributions of the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction with high accuracy at low energies ( below 1.0 mev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the legendre - polynomial fit of the angular distribution data discussed above also includes an @xmath7 interference term with a ( @xmath8 ) relative phase angle . </S>",
    "<S> this phase angle can be written as @xcite :    @xmath52 + arctan(@xmath53     + where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the measured elastic phase shifts for @xmath18 = 1 and @xmath18 = 2 respectively , and @xmath56 is the sommerfeld parameter . since this relationship was first derived in ( multi - level ) r - matrix theory @xcite it is generally assumed to be a prediction of the r - matrix theory . </S>",

    "<S> they indicate poorly understood systematic problems in the measured angular distributions @xcite , as also concluded in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly this violation of unitarity must be resolved by future measurements of complete angular distribution measured in the vicinity of the @xmath23 resonance state of @xmath13o ( @xmath57 mev ) .    to conclude we analyzed and reviewed new modern measurements of complete angular distributions of gamma - rays from the @xmath1c@xmath11 reaction measured at very low energies approaching @xmath58 mev . </S>",
    "<S> while these measurements represent a major improvement of the `` world data '' and our knowledge of the low energy cross section of the @xmath1c@xmath2o reaction , we demonstrate that thus far the measured @xmath21 values bifurcate into two groups extrapolating to @xmath59 60 kevb or @xmath50154 kevb . </S>",
    "<S> this ambiguity in the extrapolated @xmath9 value resembles the ambiguity in the extrapolated @xmath10 value where the small @xmath49 10 kevb solution can not be ruled out in favor of the large @xmath50 80 kevb solution . </S>",
    "<S> these ambiguities in the extrapolated @xmath9 and @xmath10 values must be considered by practitioners in the field of stellar evolution theory and they must be resolved by the new generation experiments now in progress @xcite or in the planning stage @xcite . </S>",
