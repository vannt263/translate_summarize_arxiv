    "a moment of inertia of the tube about this axis is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "the mass of the tube is distributed symmetrically such that tube s centre of mass is placed at the point @xmath0 .",
    "_    inside the tube there is a small ball which can slide without friction .",
    "the mass of the ball is @xmath2 .",
    "the ball can pass by the point @xmath0 and fall out from the ends of the tube .",
    "the system undergoes the standard gravity field @xmath3 .",
    "it seems to be evident that for typical motion the ball reaches an end of the tube and falls down out the tube .",
    "it is surprisingly , at least for the first glance , that this system has very many periodic solutions such that the tube turns around several times during the period .",
    "the sense of generalised coordinates @xmath4 is clear from figure [ overflow ] .",
    "a kinetic energy and a potential of the system are given by the formulas @xmath5 by the suitable choice of dimension of units we obtain @xmath6 so that a lagrangian of the system is @xmath7    [ dt5y555 ] for any constants @xmath8 system ( [ lagr ] ) has a solution @xmath9 such that    \\1 ) @xmath10    \\2 ) @xmath11    this theorem means that if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given and the tube is long enough then the system has an @xmath14periodic motion and the tube turns around @xmath13 times during the period .",
    "_ proof of lemma [ xddddd ] .",
    "_ we prove only the first inequality the second one goes in the same way .",
    "first assume that a function @xmath22 is smooth .",
    "from the formula @xmath23 it follows that @xmath24 it remains to observe that by the cauchy inequality @xmath25.\\ ] ] since the space of smooth functions is dense in @xmath16 , the inequality under consideration holds for all @xmath22 .",

    "nevertheless here and in the sequel we will hold this little bit informal notation .",
    "it will not generate a misleading .",
    "determine the following subspaces @xmath33 and @xmath34 they both are closed .",
    "moreover , from lemma [ xddddd ] it follows that a function @xmath35 is a norm in @xmath36 and the topology of this norm is equivalent to the one inherited of @xmath27 .",
    "so @xmath36 is a banach space .",
    "the proof of this lemma almost literally repeats the proof of lemma [ dfdfff ] . just note that the space @xmath38 is a reflexive space because it is a real hilbert space with standard inner product @xmath39",
    "thus the sequence @xmath55 contains a weakly convergent subsequence , we denote this subsequence by the same letters : @xmath56 since a convex set of a locally convex space is closed iff it is weakly closed @xcite , we have @xmath57 .",
    "we also know from analysis that the sequence @xmath55 contains a subsequence that is convergent in @xmath58\\times c[0,\\omega]$ ] .",
    "( see remark [ dfgdggg ] . )",
    "so we accept that @xmath59 in @xmath58\\times c[0,\\omega]$ ] .",
    "take any two functions @xmath72 and put @xmath73 from previous section it follows that a point @xmath74 is a minimum of @xmath75 .",
    "this implies @xmath76 or in the detailed form @xmath77 equations ( [ sdge5 ] ) and ( [ srt42 ] ) imply that the functions @xmath78 are the weak solutions to the lagrange equations and @xmath72 are the test functions .",
    "assume that a function @xmath84 belongs to @xmath85 .",
    "if in addition this function satisfies equality @xmath86 then @xmath87 moreover , it is clear that every function from @xmath36 can be presented in this way .",
    "let us put @xmath88 introduce the following linear functionals @xmath89 them both belong to @xmath90 . by fubini s theorem we can rewrite the last functional in the form @xmath91 from equation ( [ srt42 ] ) we know that @xmath92 therefore there exists a constant @xmath93 such that @xmath94 since @xmath95 is an arbitrary function , and the functions @xmath96 are even , equation ( [ ddfg55 ] ) takes the form @xmath97 since @xmath98",
