    "data representing two holes at the moment of time symmetry have been known for long and can be written down analytically ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",

    "the result was  @xcite @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the newman - penrose constants @xcite and where @xmath18 is the bondi parameter along @xmath14 , which tends to @xmath19 as one approaches @xmath15 . hence @xmath20 with equality at @xmath15 , as it must be .",

    "is it possible at all to get rid of the spurious radiation without touching the interior data ?",

    "the first step in this direction was taken by friedrich @xcite , who used the conformal field equations to analyse this region . in this approach ,",

    "some necessary conditions for the avoidance of such singularities are known  @xcite , but so far no theorem establishes a sufficient set . instead",
    ", the following conjecture was launched  @xcite :    * conjecture : * if an initial data set which is time - symmetric and confomally flat in a neighbourhood @xmath23 of the point @xmath8 yields a development with a smooth null infinity , then the initial data are , in fact , schwarzschild in @xmath24 .",
    "if true , the conjecture tells us that gravitational radiation is excluded near spacelike infinity . at this point",
    "one might fear that the condition of being asymptotically schwarzschild might exclude most data of physical interest .",
    "but fortunately this is not true , thanks to the work of corvino @xcite , who proved that is possible to glue a schwarzschild metric along an annulus to an asymptotically flat , conformally flat three metric if the gluing radius is chosen sufficiently large and if the mass of the schwarzschild metric is chosen appropriately .",
    "that is , there do exist spacetimes which are schwarzschild at infinity ( therefore ensuring a smooth null - infinity ) and non - static in the inside .",
    "for example , we could glue a brill - lindquist initial data set for the collision of two black holes to a schwarzschild metric .",
    "this would clearly _ remove _ the ` spurious ' radiation at spacelike infinity .",
    "however , it might at the same time _ introduce _ ` spurious ' radiation through the modified gluing metric on the annulus , which is generally very complicated .",
    "in particular , it is not conformally flat",
    ". this motivates to ask about the mass of the glued schwarzschild solution , depending on the specific gluing instructions .",
    "information about the mass is not easy to obtain : the gluing function is hard to control and not easily calculated explicitly .",
    "what we need is a physical idea of how the gluing function might look like .",
    "here we propose to specialize to brill waves .",
    "they are axisymmetric ( as is brill - lindquist ) and not conformally flat .",
    "is it possible to construct a spacetime which is brill - lindquist to some radius , has brill - form on an annulus , and is schwarzschild outside ?",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to explore this idea a little further , based on the diploma thesis by one of us  @xcite .",
    "we mentioned that the brill - lindquist data seem to contain spurious gravitational radiation near spacelike infinity and , intimately related to this fact , can not lead to an asymptotically simple spacetime .",
    "hence we wish to modify them near infinity .",
    "the techniques of corvino use the _ underdetermined _ ellipticity of the constraint equations to glue a schwarzschild end to an arbitrary asymptotically flat manifold .",
    "consider a smooth gluing function @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and an arbitrary asymptotically flat metric @xmath28 together with a schwarzschild metric @xmath29 with adm - energy @xmath30 and center @xmath31 .",
    "then , in an asymptotically flat chart , the metric @xmath32 ( for constant @xmath33 ) is smooth and glues @xmath28 to @xmath29 .",
    "however , the constraint equation of vanishing scalar curvature , @xmath34 , is now violated on the annulus , @xmath35 , hence @xmath36 is not a time - symmetric initial datum for einstein s equation .",
    "corvino now shows that it is possible to choose the gluing radius @xmath33 large enough to find a metric @xmath3 , having support only on the annulus , such that @xmath37 everywhere . to make this construction work , the variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 have to be chosen appropriately . in this way corvino s construction provides us with time - symmetric initial data , isometric to schwarzschild outside some finite radius and non - trivial in the inside .",
    "but his construction is not very explicit .",
    "we have no method at hand to construct the metric explicitly , because we do not know much more about the perturbation @xmath3 on the annulus than its existence .",
    "this leaves important physical questions unanswered : can we give a physical interpretation for the gluing construction ?",
    "one is tempted to ask the following ` physical ' questions : does the construction actually remove spurious gravitational - radiation energy , or does it at best just lead to a redistribution of energy from infinity to the annulus region ?",
    "the answer does not seem to be known .",
    "we propose to phrase these questions in a more explicit environment .",
    "consider brill - lindquist data describing the head - on collision of two black holes : @xmath38 we further simplify by choosing @xmath39 , corresponding to equal masses for the holes and @xmath40 , so that the holes lie symmetrically about the origin on the @xmath41-axis : @xmath42 these data are axisymmetric .",
    "we shall equip them with a schwarzschild end at infinity .",
    "our key assumption is that the metric on the annulus is a conformally transformed brill wave  @xcite . in cylindrical coordinates it correspond to the regular 3-metric @xmath43 here @xmath44 is a function of @xmath45 and @xmath41 satisfying the following conditions . @xmath46",

    "much work has been done to derive existence theorems for solutions @xmath48 given @xmath44 . here",
    "we will take a slightly different viewpoint .      combining the spirit of corvino s construction with our physical idea of a brill wave on the annulus",
    ", we define a conformal factor @xmath55 we have generalized the gluing function @xmath56 to be axisymmetric on the annulus : @xmath57 and @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "next we use the fourth power of the function @xmath48 in ( [ conff ] ) as conformal factor to define the physical initial - data metric : @xmath60 here @xmath44 is , by definition , a function with support on the annulus , vanishing derivatives on its boundary and which satisfies the brill - conditions ( [ brillcon ] ) .",
    "taking all this into account we observe that    * @xmath61 is brill - lindquist for @xmath62 , * @xmath61 is schwarzschild for @xmath63 ( with adm - energy @xmath64 ) , * @xmath61 is a complicated , conformally transformed brill wave on @xmath65 $ ] .",

    "is it possible to choose the right hand side of ( [ v1 ] ) such that @xmath44 simultaneously satisfies dirichlet and neumann conditions for the given region h ?",

    "although one can easily write down some @xmath76 s admitting a dn - solution , it is not clear if these @xmath76 can be obtained by @xmath77 with an appropriate choice of @xmath56the root of the problem being that the inhomogeneity is highly non - linear in @xmath56 .",
    "corvino s construction only works for large gluing radii @xmath33 .",
    "we could therefore try to solve the dn - problem to first order in the inverse gluing radius . to do this",
    "we expand the inhomogeneity to first order in @xmath78 , making two further choices :    * the first is related to the possibility of reducing the energy .",

    "the difference will scale in some way with the inverse gluing radius  the exact form being dependent on the details of the gluing procedure .",
    "recall equation ( [ conff ] ) , introduce the scaling @xmath79 and expand in the inverse gluing radius , @xmath80 : @xmath81 note that we have no @xmath82-(dipole)-terms due to the choice of equal masses for the two brill - lindquist holes and equal mass - centres for the brill - lindquist system and the schwarzschild hole .",
