    "polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments at cern @xcite , desy @xcite and slac @xcite have revealed an apparent two ( or more ) standard deviations violation of ozi in the flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath1 which is extracted from the first moment of @xmath0 ( the nucleon s first spin dependent structure function ) .",
    "this discovery has inspired much theoretical and experimental effort to understand the internal spin structure of the nucleon .    in this article",
    "we review the theory and present status of the proton spin problem in qcd .",
    "we start with a simple sum - rule for the spin of the proton ( @xmath2 ) in terms of the angular momentum of its quark and gluonic constituents : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the quark and gluonic intrinsic spin contributions to the nucleon s spin and @xmath6 is the orbital contribution .",
    "one would like to understand the spin decomposition , eq.(1 ) , both in terms of the fundamental qcd quarks and gluons and also in terms of the constituent quark quasi - particles of low - energy qcd .    in deep inelastic processes the internal structure of the nucleon",
    "is described by the qcd parton model @xcite .",
    "the deep inelastic structure functions may be written as the sum over the convolution of `` soft '' quark and gluon parton distributions with `` hard '' photon - parton scattering coefficients .",
    "the ( target dependent ) parton distributions describe a flux of quark and gluon partons carrying some fraction @xmath7 of the proton s momentum into the hard ( target independent ) photon - parton interaction which is described by the hard scattering coefficients .    in low energy processes",
    "the nucleon behaves like a colour neutral system of three massive constituent quark quasi - particles interacting self consistently with a cloud of virtual pions which is induced by spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "one of the most challenging problems in particle physics is to understand the transition between the fundamental qcd `` current '' quarks and gluons and the constituent quarks of low - energy qcd .",
    "the fundamental building blocks are the local qcd quark and gluon fields together with the non - local structure @xcite associated with gluon topology @xcite .",
    "the large mass of the constituent quarks is usually understood in terms of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and the interaction of the current quarks with a scalar condensate ( in the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite ) or in terms of scalar confinement ( in the bag model @xcite ) .    through the axial anomaly in qcd @xcite ,",
    "some fraction of the spin of the nucleon and of the constituent quark is carried by its quark and gluon partons and some fraction is carried by gluon topology @xcite .",
    "the topological winding number is a global property of the theory ; it is independent of the local quark and gluon fields .",
    "when we take the fourier transform to momentum space any topological contribution to the nucleon s spin has support only at @xmath8 .",
    "this means that whereas the nucleon s momentum is given by the sum of the momenta of the partons @xmath9 one has to be careful about writing equations such as @xmath10 some fraction of the nucleon s spin may reside at bjorken @xmath8 .",
    "this effect may be viewed as a deformation of the qcd @xmath11 vacuum @xcite inside a nucleon due to tunneling processes between vacuum states with different topological winding number .    in semi - classical quark models",
    "the quark spin content @xmath12 is equal to the nucleon s flavour singlet axial charge @xmath1 .",
    "relativistic quark - pion coupling models predict @xmath13 with about 40% of the proton s spin being carried by orbital angular momentum @xcite .    the value of @xmath1 which is extracted from polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments is @xmath14 ",
    "@xmath15 [ 1 - 9 ] ;  significantly less than the semi - classical prediction for @xmath1 .    in qcd",
    "the axial anomaly induces various gluonic contributions to the flavour singlet axial charge @xmath1 .",
    "explanations of the small value of @xmath16 have been proposed based on the qcd parton model @xcite and non - perturbative chiral @xmath17 dynamics [ 25 - 31 ] . one finds @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 ( =3 ) is the number of light flavours liberated into the final state . here",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath5 are the amount of spin carried by quark and gluon partons in the polarised proton and @xmath21 measures the gluon - topological contribution to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the topological term @xmath21 has support only at @xmath8 ; it is missed by polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments which measure the combination @xmath22 . if some fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is carried by gluon topology in qcd , then the constituent quark model predictions for @xmath1 are not necessarily in contradiction with the small value of @xmath23 extracted from deep inelastic scattering experiments . in section 5",
    "we explain a simple dynamical mechanism for producing such an effect .",
    "if there is no topological @xmath8 term , then the small value of @xmath16 would be consistent with the semi - classical prediction for @xmath12 if @xmath5 is both large and positive ( @xmath24 at @xmath25gev@xmath26 ) .",
    "if discovered in future experiments , such a large @xmath5 would pose a challenge for constituent quark models which do not naturally include such an effect .",
    "in this article we review our present understanding of the spin structure of the nucleon , both at the constituent quark level and in qcd .",
    "we emphasise present and future experiments which could help to unravel the nucleon s internal spin structure by separately measuring the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath21 contributions to @xmath1 .",

    "we refer to refs.[32 - 38 ] for further reviews on the spin structure of the nucleon in polarised deep inelastic scattering and to ref.@xcite for a review of polarised photoproduction and the transition to polarised deep inelastic scattering .",
    "our present knowledge about the spin structure of the nucleon comes from polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "these experiments involve scattering a high - energy charged lepton beam from a nucleon target at large momentum transfer squared .",
    "one measures the inclusive cross - section .",
    "the lepton beam ( electrons at desy and slac and muons at cern ) is longitudinally polarised .",

    "consider polarised @xmath32 scattering .",
    "we work in one photon exchange approximation .",

    "the flavour non - singlet @xmath59 and singlet @xmath60 coefficients are calculable in @xmath61-loop perturbation theory and have been calculated to @xmath62 precision @xcite .",

    "the polarised gluon distribution @xmath345 contributes to @xmath0 through the convolution @xmath346 .",
    "depending on the choice of factorisation scheme , the gluonic coefficient @xmath300 has at most a @xmath308 singularity when @xmath309 .",
    "in contrast , the leading term in the quark coefficient @xmath299 is @xmath347 .",
    "the convolution involving @xmath300 has the practical effect that @xmath5 makes a direct contribution to @xmath0 only at @xmath348 @xcite .    at the same time , the @xmath303 evolution of the flavour - singlet quark distribution involves the polarised gluon distribution @xmath349 at values of @xmath350 in the range ( @xmath351 ) @xcite  see eq.(63 ) .",
    "thus , through evolution , the polarised gluon distribution is relevant to the shape of @xmath0 over the complete @xmath30 range .",

    "the input distributions are evolved to the range of @xmath39 covered by the deep inelastic experiments .",
    "finally , one chooses a particular factorisation scheme ( see below ) and makes a best fit to the @xmath0 data in terms of the input shape parameters and the scale @xmath354 .",
    "several groups have followed this approach [ 4,104,105,112 - 117 ] .",
    "different qcd motivated fits to the polarised deep inelastic data yield values of @xmath355 between zero and + 2 at @xmath356gev@xmath26 .",
    "the value of @xmath28 which is extracted from these fits depends strongly on the functional form which is assumed for the input distributions with only small changes in the overall @xmath357 for the fits @xcite  we refer to de florian et al .",
    "@xcite for a nice overview of qcd fits to @xmath0 data .",
    "three schemes are commonly used in the analysis of experimental data : the @xmath358 cut - off , @xmath359 and ab schemes .",
    "these schemes correspond to different procedures for separating the phase space for photon - gluon fusion into `` hard '' and `` soft '' contributions .    in the parton model that we discussed in section 6.1 using the cut - off on the transverse momentum squared , the polarised gluon contribution to the first moment of @xmath0",
    "is associated with two - quark jet events carrying @xmath133 .",
    "the hard coefficient is given by @xmath360 in eq.(58 ) with @xmath361 and @xmath326 .",
    "this `` parton model scheme '' is sometimes called the `` chiral invariant '' ( ci ) @xcite or jet @xcite scheme .",

    "there is a proposal to polarise the proton beam at hera @xcite .",
    "a polarised proton beam at hera would allow precision measurements of @xmath0 at small @xmath30 where it becomes increasingly more sensitive to the polarised gluon distribution and to study the two - quark - jet cross - section associated with the axial anomaly .",
    "there have been many theoretical papers proposing possible explanations of the small value of @xmath16 extracted from polarised deep inelastic scattering .",

    "first , the deep inelastic data is consistent with @xmath456 in the @xmath30 range @xmath457 @xcite . at large @xmath30",
    "the data is consistent with the qcd counting rules prediction @xmath458 the data exhibits no evidence of the simple regge prediction @xmath459 when @xmath460 (  say @xmath461 ) .",
    "the smc have recently published their measurements of @xmath462 down to @xmath463 .",
    "this new data is consistent with the slac measurements and the observation @xmath464 .",
    "we make some phenomenological observations which may help to understand the relative shapes of the isotriplet parts of @xmath0 and @xmath50 .",
    "first , the total area under @xmath400 is fixed by the bjorken sum - rule .",
    "soffer and teryaev @xcite have observed that @xmath465 of the bjorken sum - rule comes from small @xmath30 ( @xmath466 ) if the shape ( 68 ) is extrapolated to @xmath8 .",
    "suppose that we pivot @xmath400 about its measured value at @xmath467 and impose the regge behaviour @xmath468 at smaller values of @xmath30 instead of the observed small @xmath30 behaviour @xmath469 .",
    "we shall call this the `` regge modified '' @xmath400 . for",
    "the `` regge modified '' @xmath400 the fraction of the total bjorken sum - rule which comes from @xmath30 less than 0.12 would be reduced to @xmath470 .",
    "that is , @xmath471 of the total bjorken sum - rule would be shifted to larger values of @xmath30 .",
    "a priori , one would expect the simple su(6 ) prediction for @xmath462 to come closest to the ratio of the leading twist contribution to the measured structure functions at a value @xmath472 close to @xmath473 _ after _ the leading twist parton distributions have been evolved to the quark model scale @xmath123 .",
    "qcd evolution shifts the value of @xmath472 to slightly smaller @xmath30 at deep inelastic @xmath39 .",
    "deep inelastic structure functions fall rapidly to zero when @xmath309 .",
    "suppose we combine the `` regge modified '' @xmath400 together with the measured @xmath435 data .",
    "the resultant `` regge modified ''",
    "@xmath462 would considerably exceed the su(6 ) prediction @xmath474 in the intermediate @xmath30 region because of the extra area that has been shifted under @xmath400 at @xmath475 .",
    "however , this contains the @xmath30 range where we would most expect the su(6 ) prediction to work ( if it is to work at all ) . in summary , _ if _ @xmath462 takes the su(6 ) value @xmath103 at some intermediate value @xmath472 and decreases towards one when we increase @xmath30 greater than @xmath472 , and if @xmath400 has a power law behaviour @xmath476 at small @xmath30 , then @xmath400 must rise at small @xmath30 ( in contradiction to regge theory ) with @xmath477 so that @xmath400 saturates the bjorken sum - rule with the physical value of @xmath56 .",
    "to summarise this section , constituent quark model calculations provide a reasonable description of @xmath0 in the intermediate @xmath30 region .",
    "the soft regge theory predictions for the small @xmath30 behaviour of the @xmath0 spin structure function seem to fail badly at deep inelastic @xmath39 .",
    "the shape of the measured isotriplet spin structure function @xmath400 may be understood in terms of perturbative qcd counting rules ( at @xmath478 ) and constituent quark model ideas ( in the @xmath30 range @xmath479 ) .",
    "relativistic constituent - quark pion coupling models predict @xmath480 .",
    "the value of @xmath1 extracted from polarised deep inelastic scattering experiments is @xmath14  0.35 .",
    "this result has inspired many theoretical ideas about the internal spin structure of the nucleon .",
    "central to these ideas is the role that the axial anomaly plays in the transition from parton to constituent quark degrees of freedom in low energy qcd .    in qcd",
    "some fraction of the spin of the nucleon and of the constituent quark may be carried by gluon topology .",
    "if the topological contribution @xmath21 is indeed finite , then the constituent quark model predictions for @xmath1 are not necessarily in contradiction with the small value of @xmath22 extracted from polarised deep inelastic scattering .",
    "* semi - inclusive measurements of @xmath0 in the current fragmentation region ( hermes ) will enable more accurate measurements of the valence and sea quark contributions to @xmath0 .",
    "if a polarised proton beam becomes available at hera it will be possible to extend this programme into the target fragmentation region and to study the target ( in-)dependence of the small value of @xmath16 .",
    "* measurements of open charm production in polarised deep inelastic scattering ( compass , hermes and slac ) will enable a direct measurement of the polarised gluon distribution @xmath298 in deep inelastic scattering .",
    "a complementary measurement of @xmath298 will come from studies of prompt photon production in polarised @xmath174 collisions at rhic .",
    "it will be interesting to compare the deep inelastic and polarised @xmath174 measurements of @xmath28 .",
    "a polarised proton beam at hera would enable us to measure @xmath0 at small @xmath30 where it is most sensitive to @xmath298 and to study the two - quark - jet cross - section associated with the axial anomaly . *",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath135 elastic scattering or parity violation in light atoms would enable us to make an independent determination of @xmath58 .",
    "the value of @xmath58 which is extracted from these elastic z@xmath289 exchange processes includes any contribution from topological polarisation at @xmath8 whereas the deep inelastic measurement does not  thus , enabling us to measure the topological term @xmath21 .",
    "the physics of the flavour - singlet axial - charge @xmath1 provides a bridge between the internal spin structure of the nucleon and chiral @xmath17 dynamics .",
    "when combined with experimental and theoretical studies of the @xmath145 system , qcd spin physics offers a new window on the role of gluons in dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
