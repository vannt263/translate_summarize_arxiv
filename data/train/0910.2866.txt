    "the dense molecular medium is an indispensable component of our understanding of the star formation law in galaxies .",
    "this is because stars are formed from dense molecular cores , not from the diffuse envelopes of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) . in order to understand the global distribution of a dense molecular medium in galaxies ,",
    "we have conducted an extragalactic co(@xmath0 ) imaging survey of nearby spiral galaxies , adios ( aste dense gas imaging of spiral galaxies ) .",
    "the submillimeter - wave co(@xmath0 ) line emission is a tracer of dense gas , because its einstein a coefficient is proportional to @xmath6 ; therefore , the critical density of co(@xmath0 ) line emission is higher than that of co(@xmath7 ) by a factor of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the current sample galaxies of the adios project includes a gma in m  31 @xcite , ngc  604 in m  33 @xcite , m  83 @xcite , and ngc  986 ( * ? ? ? * and see a summary therein ) .",
    "several authors also report large - area co(@xmath0 ) mappings covering disk regions of galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite performed co(@xmath0 ) line emission observations of 6 gmcs in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "they identified 32 molecular clumps in the gmcs , and obtained their physical properties : kinetic temperature and density of molecular gas .",
    "@xcite carried out the co(@xmath0 ) observation toward @xmath13 of ngc  6946 , and they found that the arm / inter - arm contrast of co(@xmath0 ) is significantly larger than that of co(@xmath7 ) .",
    "@xcite performed the co(@xmath0 ) mapping of some members of virgo clusters ( ngc  4254 , ngc  4321 , and ngc  4569 ) , and they examined a large - scale gradient in the gas properties traced by co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath7 ) intensity ratio .",
    "the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a new project to operate a 10 m telescope in the atacama desert of northern chile , provides us with an ideal opportunity to generate high - sensitivity and large - scale maps of co(@xmath0 ) line emission , because of the high beam efficiency of the telescope , a low system noise temperature due to the excellent receiver system and atmospheric conditions at the site , and its efficient on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping capability @xcite .",
    "the excellent performance in co mapping enables us to detect and resolve a few 100 pc scale structures of molecular gas in nearby galaxy disks .",
    "molecular gas structures on this scale are often referred to as giant molecular - cloud associations ( gmas ) @xcite , whose typical masses are @xmath14 .",
    "observational studies of gmas in galaxies provide us with invaluable clues to the physics that governs large - scale star formation in the disk regions of galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . of course , it is essential to investigate physical parameters of gmas themselves , i.e. , their distributions , sizes , velocity dispersions , masses , and luminosities in order to understand their origin and nature .",
    "studies of gma properties in galaxies have been mainly performed toward the grand - design spiral galaxy m  51 .",
    "for example , @xcite identified 26 gmas in the spiral arm and the inter - arm of m  51 at a spatial resolution of 500 pc @xmath2 350 pc .",
    "they found that most gmas in the spiral arm appeared to be bound , whereas those in the inter - arm appeared to be unbound , although they could only give the upper limit of virial masses for 14 gmas due to the limitation of sensitivity .",
    "@xcite studied the issue of gma formation and destruction .",
    "the author concluded that both gravitational instability and collisional agglomeration of molecular gas were viable mechanisms for producing bound gmas in the spiral arm .",
    "in addition , @xcite obtained the higher - quality co(@xmath7 ) image of m  51 .",
    "the authors discussed the velocity gradients across the spiral arms in detail , and they found that the velocity gradients generally become steeper between gmas than within them .",
    "however , these studies are limited to the relatively narrow , central @xmath15  @xmath16 region of m  51 .",
    "so they could not obtain a spatially unbiased gma sample covering the whole galaxy disk . moreover , there are few studies of gma properties toward other galaxies .",
    "therefore , high angular resolution and high sensitivity co images covering whole galaxy disks are required in order to obtain a sufficient number of gma samples and to study not only properties of gmas but also their relationships with star formation .    in this paper",
    ", we present new co(@xmath0 ) images of the nearby barred spiral galaxy m  83 using the aste , employing otf mapping mode .",
    "m  83 is a nearby , face - on , barred , grand - design spiral galaxy hosting an intense starburst at its center .",
    "the distance to m  83 is estimated to be 4.5 mpc @xcite ; therefore , 1@xmath3 corresponds to 22 pc .",
    "the inclination of m 83 is 24@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "its proximity and face - on view enable us to resolve not only spiral arm structures but also each gma within these structures even by single - dish observations at millimeter or submillimeter wavelength .",
    "in addition , substructures diverging from the bar - ends and spiral arms are already found in m  83 .",
    "figure  1 shows the spitzer / irac 8 @xmath5 m image , depicting not only clear - cut spiral arm structures but also a number of capillary substructures stretching from spiral arms .",
    "these substructures are often referred to as `` spurs '' ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in this study , we divided the m  83 disk into two regions ; the spiral arm region and the inter - arm region .",
    "we refer to the continuous and thick structures seamlessly linked from the bar in the 8 @xmath5 m image as the `` spiral arm '' , and refer to the other region , including spurs , as the `` inter - arm '' . if we detect molecular gas associated with spurs , we can study details of the difference in gma properties between spiral arm and inter - arm regions . until recently ,",
    "co(@xmath0 ) images of m  83 were limited to the nuclear region and the bar @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented wider co(@xmath0 ) image including inner spiral arms , but they could not detect co(@xmath0 ) line emission in inter - arm regions and not cover outer spiral arms .",
    "in addition , their co(@xmath0 ) map is not sufficiently sensitive to resolve and identify each gma in the m  83 disk .",
    "the goals of this paper are : ( 1 ) to depict the global distribution of co(@xmath0 ) line emission which is wider and more sensitive than previous co(@xmath0 ) image @xcite , ( 2 ) to identify gmas throughout the whole m  83 disk , and to obtain their physical parameters ( sizes , velocity dispersions , luminosities , and masses ) , and ( 3 ) to investigate differences between gmas on spiral arms and those in inter - arm regions comparing their physical parameters , and finally to study the origin and the detailed nature of inter - arm gmas .",
    "further analysis of the quantitative relationship between co(@xmath0)/co(@xmath7 ) ratios and star formation will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "co(@xmath0 ) line emission observations of m 83 were performed using the aste from may 15  21 , 2008 .",
    "the total time for the observations was 42 hours .",
    "the size of the co(@xmath0 ) map is about @xmath1 ( 10.5 @xmath2 10.5 kpc ) , including the whole optical disk .",
    "the coverage of @xmath1 is the largest of all the co(@xmath0 ) mappings towards external galaxies .",
    "the mapped region is indicated in figure  2 .",
    "the full - half power beam width ( hpbw ) of the aste 10 m dish is 22@xmath3 at this frequency ; this corresponds to 480 pc at a distance of 4.5 mpc .",
    "we used a waveguide - type sideband - separating sis mixer receiver for the single side band ( ssb ) operation , cats345 @xcite .",
    "the image rejection ratio at 345 ghz was estimated to be @xmath10 10 db .",
    "the backend was a digital autocorrelator system , mac @xcite , which comprises four banks of a 512 mhz wide spectrometer with 1024 spectral channels each .",
    "this arrangement provided a velocity coverage of 440 km s@xmath18 with a velocity interval of 0.43 km s@xmath18 .",
    "the observations were made remotely from the aste operation room at the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) using a network observation system n - cosmos3 developed at naoj @xcite . since the observations were carried out in excellent atmospheric conditions ( the opacity of 220  ghz was always lower than 0.05 ) , the system noise temperature was typically 200 k ( in ssb ) .",
    "otf mapping was performed along two different directions ( i.e. , scans along the ra and dec directions ) , and these two data sets were co - added by the basket - weave method @xcite in order to remove any effects of scanning noise . at the beginning of each otf scan , an off - source position , which was 10@xmath19 offset in the r.a .",
    "direction from the map center taken at @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( j2000 ) , was observed to subtract sky emission .",
    "we observed the co(@xmath0 ) line emission of a carbon star ii lup every 2 hours in order to check the stabilities of the pointing accuracy , which was found to be better than @xmath10 2@xmath3 r.m.s .",
    "in addition , we observed the co(@xmath0 ) line emission of cw leo and w  28 to obtain the main beam efficiency @xmath22 every day .",
    "we compared our co(@xmath0 ) spectra with those obtained by cso observations @xcite , and @xmath22 was estimated to be 0.54  0.60 during the observing runs .",
    "the absolute error of the co(@xmath0 ) amplitude scale was about @xmath23 20% , mainly due to variations in @xmath22 and the image rejection ratio of the cats345 .",
    "the data reduction was made using the software package nostar , which comprises tools for otf data analysis , developed by naoj @xcite .",
    "the raw data were regridded to 7@xmath3.5 per pixel , giving an effective spatial resolution of approximately 25@xmath3 ( or 550 pc ) .",
    "linear baselines were subtracted from the spectra .",
    "we binned the adjacent channels to a velocity resolution of 5 km s@xmath18 for the co(@xmath0 ) spectra . going through these procedures ,",
    "a 3d data cube was created .",
    "the resultant r.m.s .  noise level ( 1 @xmath24 ) was typically in the range of 25 to 30 mk in the @xmath25 scale at a beam size of 25@xmath3 ( hpbw ) .",
    "the observation parameters of m  83 are summarized in table  1 .",
    "figure  3 shows spectra of the co(@xmath0 ) line emission of m  83 .",
    "in addition , figure  4 shows the spectra in the center , the eastern bar - end , and the western spiral arm , where the peak temperature of the co(@xmath0 ) line emission exceeds 0.5  k. we have detected significant co(@xmath0 ) line emission not only in the central region ( peak temperature @xmath26 1.0 k ) , the bar ( 0.3  0.5 k ) , the bar - ends ( 0.4  0.8 k ) , and the spiral arms ( 0.2  0.7 k ) but also in the inner inter - arm regions ( 0.1  0.2 k ) which are surrounded by the central region and the western spiral arm . in addition , we have detected substructures diverging from spiral arms in the co(@xmath0 ) line emission .",
    "these substructures are molecular gases associated with spurs .",
    "@xcite also detected such molecular spurs in m  51 .",
    "velocity - integrated intensities , @xmath27 , were calculated from the co(@xmath0 ) line emission within a velocity range of 380 to 620 km s@xmath18 using the nrao aips task momnt . at the map center , we found @xmath27 = 147 @xmath23 2 k km s@xmath18 at a resolution of 25@xmath3 .",
    "this @xmath27 value seems in excellent agreement with that of the previous observation @xcite , 161 @xmath23 4 k km s@xmath18 , at a resolution of 22@xmath3 if we consider the small difference in the spatial resolution .",
    "in addition , we have calculated the luminosity of co(@xmath0 ) , @xmath28 , over the observed @xmath29 region .",
    "we found @xmath28 = 5.7 @xmath2 @xmath30 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 , which is slightly greater than the previously obtained value , 5.1 @xmath2 @xmath30 k",
    "km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 ( @xmath32 @xmath33 3.5 kpc ) , by @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that our new co(@xmath0 ) map covers a wider region of the m  83 disk than the previous one .",
    "the derived @xmath28 of m  83 is comparable with that of the whole disk region of the prominent barred galaxy ngc  986 , 5.4 @xmath2 @xmath30 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 @xcite . it should be noteworthy that the extended co(@xmath0 ) emission contributes a lot to the total luminosity ; the central ( @xmath34 ) co(@xmath0 ) luminosity is @xmath35 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 , just @xmath10 1/6 of the total luminosity .",
    "this result emphasizes that it is important to observe extended component in order to quantify the total luminosity of co even in a higher transition like @xmath0 .",
    "map parameters and physical properties of m  83 are listed in table  2 .",
    "figure  5a shows an integrated intensity map in co(@xmath0 ) line emission of m  83 .",
    "the 1 @xmath24 noise level of this map is 1.0 k km s@xmath18 .",
    "compared with the previous co(@xmath0 ) map obtained by @xcite , spiral arms are more clearly depicted . as seen in the spectra ( figure  3 ) ,",
    "molecular substructures associated with spurs also appear in the co(@xmath0 ) integrated intensity map .",
    "some of them seem bridges connecting inner bar - ends / spiral arms and outer arms .",
    "figure  5b displays a velocity field in the co(@xmath0 ) line .",
    "a warp of velocity field is clearly seen in the western spiral arm , suggesting the existence of streaming motion .",
    "we found that the spur - like substructures in co(@xmath0 ) line emission are well spatially coincident with the distribution of massive star forming regions traced by h@xmath4 luminosity and spitzer / irac 8 @xmath5 m emission as shown in figure  6 .",
    "these coincidences strongly suggest that the spur - like substructures appearing in co(@xmath0 ) line emission are neither the noise nor the artifact produced during the data reduction but significant structures of m  83 .",
    "good spatial correlation between co(@xmath0 ) line emission and massive star formation in spiral arms of m  83 has already reported by @xcite , but we newly found that this spatial correlation is true even in the inter - arm region .",
    "in addition , we compared co(@xmath0 ) line intensities with h@xmath4 luminosities at a resolution of @xmath36 over the whole m  83 disk .",
    "here we employed calibrated h@xmath4 luminosities using the spitzer / mips 24 @xmath5 m data according to the procedure introduced by @xcite .",
    "we used an h@xmath4 image obtained with the ctio 1.5 m telescope @xcite and an archival mips 24 @xmath5 m image ( p00059 , george , rieke , starburst activity in nearby galaxies ) .",
    "the formula to calibrate h@xmath4 luminosity using 24 @xmath5 m image is as follows @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 means calibrated and observed h@xmath4 luminosities , respectively .",
    "@xmath40 means the observed 24 @xmath5 m luminosity .",
    "figure  7 shows the correlation between co(@xmath0 ) intensities and calibrated h@xmath4 luminosities over the whole m  83 disk .",
    "we found the index of this correlation to be 0.96 @xmath23 0.12 , which is significantly lower than that of the standard schmidt law using co(@xmath7 ) intensity , 1.4 @xcite .",
    "this tendency for the index of `` co(@xmath0 ) schmidt law '' to be lower than that of `` co(@xmath7 ) schmidt law '' is also found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in addition , similar situations are also found in studies of hcn(@xmath7 ) line emission , an excellent dense gas tracer .",
    "@xcite found the linear correlation between hcn(@xmath7 ) luminosities and star formation rates traced by infrared luminosities over three orders of magnitude .",
    "moreover , numerical simulations also predict a linear correlation between volume - averaged density of star formation rate and that of molecular gas @xcite .",
    "co emission line from molecular clouds is generally optically thick , but the observation beam contains many molecular clouds in co emission observation of galaxies .",
    "therefore , measurement of co line intensity corresponds to counting up the number of molecular clouds .",
    "this concept is well known as a `` mist '' model , proposed by @xcite . in observations of co(@xmath0 )",
    "line emission and hcn(@xmath7 ) line emission which trace a denser part of the molecular gas , measurements of their intensity correspond to the number of star forming dense cores rather than that of molecular clouds .",
    "therefore , co(@xmath0 ) line intensity can trace the inner portion of the molecular clouds , i.e. , denser part of the molecular clouds , even if the line is optically thick .",
    "therefore , the intensity is proportional to the amount of massive star formed in dense molecular clouds .    on the other hand , the fact that the index of `` co(@xmath7 ) schmidt law '' is 1.4 means that the more massive molecular gas , and the higher star formation efficiency , which is defined as star formation rate per unit gas mass .",
    "this suggests the fraction of dense molecular gas become higher in massive molecular clouds than in less massive molecular clouds .",
    "it is unclear why there is such a tendency yet . in order to study the index of schmidt law more detail ,",
    "we need both further analysis using other spectral lines such as @xmath41co(@xmath7 ) and hcn(@xmath7 ) and the progress of numerical study concerning the evolution of interstellar matter and star formation .    in figure  5 and 6 , one can find several local co peaks in the spiral arm and isolated clump - like co peaks in inter - arm regions , associated with giant hii regions .",
    "these clump - like structures whose sizes are typically a few @xmath2 100 pc correspond to gmas , which are literally ensembles of gmcs .",
    "gmas are important gaseous constituents of galaxies , because the kpc - scale major structures such as the bar and the spiral arms consist of multiple gmas .",
    "since our new co(@xmath0 ) data set covers a wider region ( 10.5 @xmath2 10.5 kpc ) and achieves a significantly low noise level ( 1 @xmath24 @xmath10 25  30 mk in @xmath25 ) , we were able to find many individual co(@xmath0 ) clumps over the m  83 disk . in order to identify each clump objectively and to obtain its physical parameters , we employed the clumpfind algorithm developed by @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we discuss relationships among the size , velocity dispersion , and luminosity of each gma identified as a clump according to the clumpfind algorithm .",
    "then , we study the properties of gmas in the m  83 disk throughout the comparison of their virial masses and co luminosity masses . finally , we investigate the origin and the nature of gmas in the inter - arm region .      first , we ran the clumpfind software setting a peak threshold of 4 @xmath24 and a contour increment of 1 @xmath24 . in this condition , we identified 99 clumps in the whole m  83 disk .",
    "then , we excluded clumps without adjacent pixels exceeding 3 @xmath24 or adjacent channel exceeding 3 @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , we excluded clumps whose diameters are smaller than effective spatial resolution of our co(@xmath0 ) data ( @xmath36 @xmath10 550 pc ) after the deconvolution of clump size with 25@xmath3 beam , according to the following formula , @xmath42{\\theta_{\\rm given}^2 - 25 ^ 2 } \\,\\,\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath43 is a deconvolved clump size in arcsec unit , and @xmath44 is a clump size determined by the clumpfind algorithm .",
    "finally , we identified 54 clumps in the m  83 disk ( @xmath32 @xmath26 1 kpc ) , and obtained their radii , velocity dispersions , and co(@xmath0 ) luminosities .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these identified clumps simply as `` gmas '' in this paper .",
    "we show an example of the individual spectrum of an identified gma in figure 8 .",
    "this shows a gaussian shape ( a fitted line is also displayed in the figure ) , and the most of the identified clumps tend to have a similar shape .",
    "this is consistent with the mist model by @xcite .",
    "we obtained the total luminosity of all the identified gmas to be 2.1 @xmath2 @xmath30 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 , which corresponds to 44 % of total luminosity of the m  83 disk , 4.8 @xmath2 @xmath30 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 .",
    "the other 56% luminosity may originate in diffuse components of molecular gas .",
    "note that we were unable to identify narrow line - width gmas due to finite velocity resolution ( 5 km s@xmath18 ) .",
    "the lower limit of line width that we can detect is 10.3 km s@xmath18 ( corresponding to the velocity dispersion @xmath45 = 4.4 km s@xmath18 ) for 4 @xmath24 peak gma and 8.2 km s@xmath18",
    "( @xmath45 = 3.5 km s@xmath18 ) for 5 @xmath24 peak gmas if we assume the gaussian line profile . in this condition ,",

    "km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to the lower limit of co luminosity mass of 1.8 @xmath47 @xmath48 ( see subsection 4.3.2 ) .",
    "figure  9 and 10 show positions of identified gmas on the co(@xmath0 ) velocity channel maps and on the spitzer / irac 8 @xmath5 m map , respectively .",
    "gmas are widely distributed over the m  83 disk .",
    "we divided these gmas into two groups according to the location : the spiral arm and the inter - arm .",
    "we identified 27 gmas in the spiral arm , and refer to these as `` on - arm gmas '' .",
    "meanwhile , we also identified 27 gmas in the inter - arm , and refer to these as `` inter - arm gmas '' .",
    "obtained properties of identified gmas are summarized in table 3 and 4 . except for some gmas ,",

    "any gma with larger @xmath45 exceeding 10 km s@xmath18 are distributed near the center and the bar .",
    "strong non - circular motion along the molecular bar @xcite may affect these gmas , and consequently increase their velocity dispersions .        comparing properties between on - arm gmas and inter - arm gmas , we found the difference in the gma radius @xmath50 and the co(@xmath0 ) luminosity @xmath49 .",
    "figure  11 shows the histograms of @xmath50 and @xmath49 for on - arm and inter - arm gmas .",

    "therefore , the errors of @xmath52 mainly originate in those of adopted @xmath62 values and the uncertainty of @xmath63 .",
    "the overall error of @xmath52 was estimated to be about 40% .",

    "in addition , as shown in figure  9 , the systemic velocity of this gma ( 507.5 km s@xmath18 ) is shifted from the main component ( 467.5  477.5 km s@xmath18 ) of the spiral arm there . therefore , we perhaps have to refer to this gma as an inter - arm gma if it is not fake but `` true '' .      finally , we discuss the origin and the nature of inter - arm gmas in m  83 .",
    "we first briefly review the formation process of spurs , which are major substructures in inter - arm regions . according to numerical simulations @xcite , spur structures in inter - arm regions are formed as follows .",
    "molecular gas clumps in spiral arms are first formed by the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "then , some clumps fall along the spiral shocks , whereas other gases try to maintain nearly circular rotation . as a result , they move away from the spiral shock towards outer spiral arms .",
    "since a clump has the internal gradient of its angular momentum , the clumps gas eventually extends to inter - arm regions as it rotates in the galactic potential .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that gmas distributed in inter - arm regions are ensembles of gmcs moving away from spiral arms in this way .",
    "these gmcs / gmas might be extended by shear motion , and finally they could be destroyed and change into atomic phase . however , as can be seen in figure  6 , massive star forming regions are distributed even in inter - arm regions , corresponding to co(@xmath0 ) spurs .",
    "this suggests dense gas formation and massive star formation can occur within inter - arm gmas .",
    "figure  13 shows a correlation between an h@xmath4 luminosity and a virial parameter @xmath4 for each inter - arm gma in m  83 .",
    "an anti - correlation can be seen ; gmas with large @xmath4 tend _ not _ to be associated with massive star forming regions .",
    "then , we investigate what parameter of the gma determines @xmath4 .",
    "figure  14 shows a comparison between the radius @xmath50 , velocity dispersion @xmath45 , and @xmath4 .",
    "obviously , @xmath45 correlates well with @xmath4 , whereas little correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath4 can be seen .",
    "therefore , these plots suggest that @xmath4 increases depending on @xmath45 rather than @xmath50 . this dependence is also found for gmcs in the spiral arm of ic  342 @xcite and at the center of the milky way @xcite . considering that a gma is an ensemble of multiple gmcs and",
    "the actual star formation occurs in the dense molecular cores of molecular clouds , it is suggested that increase in the velocity dispersion of a gmc component within a gma , @xmath70 , prevents the onset of star formation within the gmc and we have observed the increase in @xmath70 as the increase in the overall @xmath45 of the gma due to the inadequate spatial resolution .",
    "of course , the shear motion may also increase gmc - to - gmc velocity dispersions within the gma , contributing the increase in overall @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , we suggest that there mainly exist two kinds of inter - arm gmas .",
    "one is virialized ( @xmath4 @xmath10 1 ) gmas with smaller @xmath45 , which are not affected by the shear motion .",
    "then star formation may occur within these gmas even after moving away from spiral arms toward the inter - arm region .",
    "the other is unvirialized gmas with larger @xmath45 and @xmath4 , which are affected by the shear motion .",
    "star formation process within these gmas might be suppressed due to the increase in the internal velocity dispersion of gmcs , @xmath70 .",
    "note that since our co observations are performed by a single dish telescope , we can not resolve each gmc within identified gmas . in order to study the relationship of @xmath70 , @xmath45 , virial mass , and star formation in more detail , high angular resolution observations using radio interferometers are necessary .",
    "we present co(@xmath0 ) line emission observations with the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) toward the @xmath1 ( or 10.5 @xmath2 10.5 kpc at the distance of 4.5 mpc ) region of the nearby barred spiral galaxy m  83 at an effective resolution of 25@xmath3 ( 550pc ) .",
    "a summary of this work is as follows .    1",
    ".   our co(@xmath0 ) map could depict not only spiral arm structures but also spur - like substructures extended in the inter - arm region .",
    "we found that the spur - like substructures in co(@xmath0 ) emission are well coincident with the distribution of massive star forming regions traced by h@xmath4 luminosity and spitzer / irac 8 @xmath5 m emission .",
    "we found that the total luminosity of co(@xmath0 ) is 5.7 @xmath2 @xmath30 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 , which is @xmath10 6 times higher than the central ( @xmath34 ) co(@xmath0 ) luminosity , @xmath35 k km s@xmath18 pc@xmath31 .",
    "this result emphasizes that it is important to observe extended component in order to quantify the total luminosity of co even in a higher transition like @xmath0 .",
    "3 .   we found a linear and tight correlation between co(@xmath0 ) line intensity and extinction corrected h@xmath4 luminosity .",
    "the index of the correlation is 0.96 @xmath23 0.12 , and its correlation coefficient @xmath71 was 0.76 .",
    "the observed slope is significantly smaller than that in the schmidt law derived from co(@xmath7 ) emission in the literature ( @xmath10 1.4 ) , and it agrees well with a theoretical prediction by @xcite .",
    "we have identified 54 co(@xmath0 ) clumps as gmas employing the clumpfind algorithm , this is the largest gma sample toward external galaxy disks .",
    "we have obtained their sizes , velocity dispersions , co(@xmath0 ) luminosities , virial masses , and co luminosity masses .",
    "we found that on - arm gmas are relatively larger and brighter in co(@xmath0 ) than inter - arm gmas .",
    "we found that the virial parameter @xmath4 , which is defined as the ratio of the virial mass to the co luminosity mass , is almost unity for gmas in spiral arms , whereas there exist some gmas whose @xmath4 are 3  10 in the inter - arm region . in addition",
    ", we found that gmas with higher @xmath4 tend not to be associated with massive star forming regions , while other virialized gmas are associated with star forming regions .",
    "we suggest that there mainly exist two kinds of inter - arm gmas .",
    "one is virialized gmas with small @xmath45 , which are not affected by the shear motion , and within which star formation may occur .",
    "the other is unvirialized gmas with large @xmath45 , which are affected by the shear motion .",
