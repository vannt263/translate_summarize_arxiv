    "richard dawkins coined the word `` meme '' to designate ideas or messages that spread and evolve analogously to genes through communication@xcite . determining the extent to which the gene analogy applies to memes has been hampered by the lack of large - scale data containing the evolution histories of many memes , where one can pinpoint when and where information was modified and how the modifications were subsequently diffused . in this study",
    "we are able to gather precisely such data , consisting of near - complete traces of thousands of memes , collectively comprising over 460 million individual instances propagated via facebook .",
    "facebook is an online social network that enables individuals to communicate with their friends .",
    "the primary mechanism for this communication are _ status updates _ which appear in news feeds of friends .",
    "a message or idea that is appealing can quickly propagate , as those friends can choose to post the message as their own status update , thus exposing their own friends . in this way",
    "facebook acts as a large petri dish in which memes can mutate and replicate over the substrate of the network of friendship ties .",
    "while there are other environments where memes flourish , those memes that do enter facebook can be examined in detail , uncovering mechanisms previously difficult  or impossible  to study .",
    "we analyzed anonymized data gathered over a period of 18 months , from april 2009october 2011 during which many memes were propagated as textual status updates on facebook . in april 2009",
    "the character limit on the status update had been increased , allowing one to not only express a complete idea or story , but also add replication instructions , e.g. `` copy and paste '' or `` repost '' .",
    "widely propagated memes would typically carry these instructions because there was yet no `` share '' functionality , which could at the click of a button exactly replicate the information as one s own update . as a result ,",
    "memes propagating via a manual copy and paste mechanism can be exact , or they might contain a  mutation \" , an accidental or intentional modification . since the notion of a meme",
    "was first based on the parallels between genes and ideas , we consider how textual status updates match genes in their structure and mechanics .",
    "first , they encode information , whether it is a joke , a warning , or a call to action , in a way that parallels genetic information : a string of characters is  transcribed \" , allowing for some characters to be added , deleted , or substituted .",
    "second , the replication ( accurate or inaccurate ) can be performed by anyone exposed to the meme .",
    "there are other forms in which memes occur in online environments , e.g. photographs or videos . however , the information in these is not as readily analyzed , and they can not be as easily modified by anyone as spoken or written ideas can .",
    "we therefore focus our attention on textual status updates on facebook to understand how information evolves when anyone can easily modify and retell it .    ]",
    "prior studies have either analyzed the overall popularity of memes  @xcite , or examined a small sample of meme variants in detail  @xcite .",
    "however , neither the large nor small  scale studies have been able to formulate a model by which new meme variants arise .",
    "this has left a gap in our understanding of the mechanism by which social networks can cause information to evolve , a mechanism that carries important implications for the fidelity of all socially transmitted information , as well as for specific types of information such as political campaign messages  @xcite .",
    "it is also unclear the extent to which the biological analogy of genetic evolution carries over into the evolution of memes .",
    "we will use the terminology from genetics in describing the processes memes undergo , but defer evaluation of the biological analogy to the discussion .",
    "in this study , we are interested in memes that are replicated when a user copies a piece of text from a friend .",
    "typically , this is done by selecting the text of the friend s update , copying it , pasting it into one s own status update box , and sometimes editing the text further before clicking ` post ' .",
    "however , the abundance of typos in some variants indicates that they were retyped character - by - character as opposed to replicated via a block copy - and - paste action .",
    "we define the mutation rate @xmath0 as the proportion of copies which introduce new edits as opposed to creating exact replicas .",
    "we further link each new variant to the variant it was most likely derived from , as described below .    to see concretely how mutation occurs we consider the meme `` no one should die because they can not afford health care and no one should go broke because they get sick .",
    "if you agree please post this as your status for the rest of the day . '' in this form , which emerged early on in the meme s evolution , it was copied over 470,000 times .",
    "a variant prepending `` thinks that '' ( which would follow the individual s name ) , was copied 60,000 times .",
    "the third most popular variant inserted `` we are only as strong as the weakest among us '' in the middle .",
    "some copies changed `` the rest of the day '' to `` the next 24 hours . ''",
    "figure  [ fig : nooneshouldphylo ] shows how this particular timing trait is passed down through the genetic lineage .",
    "the high number of exact copies is consistent with this meme having a modest mutation rate @xmath1 .",
    "that is , 89% of the copies were exact , while 11% introduced a mutation .    in order to trace the lineage of particular variants",
    ", we use the edit distance of between the variant a user posted and the variants previously posted by the user s friends .",
    "we define the edit distance as the number of character additions and deletions that must be performed in order to obtain one variant of the meme from another . for example",
    ", changing the phrase `` thinks that '' to `` agrees that '' creates two variants separated by edit distance 10 , since the 5 characters ` t h i n k ' are deleted and ` a g r e e ' are added . as might be expected",
    ", there is a compound effect of such mutations over several generations , with edit distance increasing as copy is made from copy is made from copy ( figure  [ fig : editgraphdistance ] ) .      before examining the lineage of any particular copy , we cluster variants into memes according to their textual similarity ( see _ materials & methods _ for details ) in order to identify the memes captured in the data .",
    "this processes yields a set of 4087 large memes , each of which has at least one variant with 100 copies between april 2009 and october 2011 .",
    "the first striking pattern in the data is the uneven popularity of the variants , shown in figure  [ fig : variantpop ] . for 121 of the 123 largest memes with over 100,000 distinct variants each , a kolmogorov - smirnov test confirmed a power - law fit ( @xmath2 ) , with maximum likelihood - fitted exponents of @xmath3 .",
    "expanding to the 435 memes with an excess of 10,000 variants yielded similar exponents : @xmath4 .         + name & valence + democratic party & -1 + republican party & 1 + conservative & 1 + liberal & -1 + moderate & 0 + independent & 0 + very liberal & -2 + democratic party & -1 + independence party of america & 0 + very conservative & 2 + barack obama & -1 + conservative party & 1 + democratic & -1 + democrat & -1 + liberal democratic party & -2 + republican & 1 + independent citizens movement & 1 + green party & -2 + republican & 1 + conservatives & 1 + peace and freedom party & -2 + tea party & 2 + constitution party & 2 + obama & -1 + conservative republicans & 2 + neutral & 0 + socialist party usa & -2 + independent & 0 + independent party & 0 + socialist & -2 + middle of the road & 0 + conservative democrat & -1 + progressive & -1 + moderate liberal & -1 + moderate party & 0 + centrist & 0 + conservative republican & 2 + communism & -2 + rebublican & 1 + conservative independent & 1 + democratic party & -1 + 0.2 cm of the virgin islands & + america first party & 2 + reform party of the & 1 + 0.2 cm united states of america & + conservative liberal & -1 + liberal conservative & 1 + fiscal conservative & 1 + moderate conservative & 1 + liberal republican & 1 + nobama & 1 + communist & -2 + gop & 1 + democrata & -1 + obama sucks !"
