    "indeed , fluctuations ( goldstone modes ) destroy any long range order , even at low temperatures . nonetheless , 2d models such as the xy do present two different phases , separated by an infinite order phase transition at @xmath5 known as the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite .",
    "the low temperature phase is characterized by bound pairs of vortices and antivortices and power - law decaying correlations driven by the spin waves , while above the critical temperature the vortices decouple and correlations decay exponentially . moreover , unlike the usual thermodynamic phases , the low - temperature , quasi - long - range order bkt phase is critical at all temperatures below @xmath5 . at this temperature , the helicity modulus , which is the order parameter that measures how the system responds to a global twist  @xcite , has a universal , discontinuous jump signaling the decoupling of vortices and anti - vortices .",
    "here we study a generalization of the xy model with a competing term that favors a different alignment angle , depending on the parameter @xmath2 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 .",
    "the sum is over nearest neighbors , @xmath9 and the usual xy model , with ferromagnetic interactions is recovered either when @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 the pure nematic term induces skewed alignments with angles @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an integer . since the partition function for the cases @xmath12 and",
    "1 can be mapped onto each other by the transformation @xmath15 , the critical temperature  @xcite is the same , @xmath16 .",
    "this transition , from the high temperature paramagnetic phase to a phase where there is local , non long ranged ordering , either nematic ( for small @xmath17 ) or ferromagnetic ( large @xmath17 ) , is a bkt transition . in the intermediate region where both terms compete , although new phases may appear at low temperature , the transition from the paramagnetic phase seems to be bkt for all values of @xmath17 ( albeit it remains possible that a non bkt transition may exist close to the multicritic point  @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , since the presence of a competing term helps to disrupt both the nematic and ferromagnetic orderings , the transition temperature @xmath18 is smaller at intermediate values of @xmath17 . at its minimum , that gets closer to @xmath19 as @xmath2 increases ,",

    "the nematic term , albeit with continuous variables , has some similarity with the discrete clock model .",
    "how similar is the behavior of both models ? in order to answer these questions , we present new results for larger lattices ( on the square and cubic lattices with periodic boundary conditions ) also exploiting the power provided by gpu computation and cluster algorithms  @xcite .    in order to clarify the nature of the phase transitions",
    ", we consider the modulus of the generalized magnetization , @xmath31 and the corresponding susceptibilities and binder cumulants  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 means thermal average .",
    "the specific heat is also measured in order to obtain a rough location of the transition lines on the phase diagram . in 3d , because the low temperature phase has genuine long - range order , or for second order transitions that are present in 2d , the critical exponents @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 may be obtained via standard finite size scaling relations , @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 . in 2d , however , because the pseudo - ordered phase is critical everywhere , the magnetization goes to zero while the susceptibility diverges in the thermodynamic limit for all temperatures below the bkt transition .    for a bkt transition ,",

    "moreover , a fourth - order helicity modulus @xmath53 can be introduced in a similar way  @xcite , @xmath54 , with the perturbed free energy , up to fourth order , given by @xmath55 .",

    "besides the paramagnetic phase ( * p * ) at high temperatures , there are two phases with quasi long range order , each one associated with the pure cases at @xmath12 and 1 .",
    "the former is a nematic - like phase ( * n * ) while the latter has local ferromagnetic ordering ( * f*@xmath26 ) . the * n*-*f*@xmath26 transition is second order and is either in the ising or in the three states potts model universality class for @xmath3 and 3 , respectively .",
