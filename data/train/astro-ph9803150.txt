    "over the next few years a number of ground based , balloon and satellite experiments will measure cmb sky with an unprecedented accuracy and detail .",
    "the promise of a one percent precision on the measured power spectrum of cmb anisotropies requires a similar accuracy in the theoretical predictions , if we are to exploit all the information present in the data .",
    "the rewards will be rich : among other things this will allow an accurate determination of a number of cosmological parameters and testing of current structure formation theories @xcite . in principle",
    "such a program is possible , since the anisotropies were produced when the universe was still in the linear regime , which makes the calculations of model predictions very accurate . in practice",
    "there are a number of important effects that need to be included if this goal is to be realized .",
    "one of the most important among these is the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "as photons propagate through the universe from their last scattering to our detectors they are randomly deflected by the gravitational force exerted upon them by the inhomogeneous mass distribution .",
    "previous work has shown that gravitational lensing has an effect on the temperature anisotropy power spectrum which is not insignificant @xcite .",
    "the random deflections smear out the sharp features in the correlation function or power spectrum , leading to a suppression of acoustic oscillations .",
    "gravitational lensing can also enhance power on the damping tail , causing it to decay less rapidly than predicted on very small angular scales @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing effect on the temperature anisotropies has been discussed several times in the literature and the formalism to calculate it using the evolution of density power spectrum both in linear and nonlinear regime has been presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this calculation to the two linear polarization power spectra and to the cross - correlation spectrum between temperature and polarization . because acoustic oscillations are narrower for polarization spectra than for temperature , one expects gravitational lensing effect to be more significant in the former and indeed our results confirm this .",
    "in addition , a qualitatively new effect is the mixing between @xmath2 and @xmath1 types of polarization , which changes the pattern of polarization .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in  [ formalism ]",
    "we develop the formalism : this section contains all the main analytic expressions needed for a numerical implementation of the effect .",
    "these have been numerically implemented in the new version of cmbfast package ( version 2.4 ) and require only a marginal increase in the cpu time for their evaluations . in  [ estimate ]",
    "we compute the effect for a typical cosmological model and address the question of direct observability of the effect .",
    "we present the conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "the large scale density fluctuations in the universe induce random deflections in the direction of the cmb photons as they propagate from the last scattering surface to us .",
    "this alters the power spectrum of both the temperature and polarization anisotropies .",
    "the quantity is responsible for the deflections is the projected surface density . since the structures are not very correlated on large scales the gravitational lensing effect is only relevant at the small angular scales in the cmb . we may hence use the small scale limit formalism @xcite , which simplifies the calculations .    the observed cmb temperature in the direction @xmath3 is @xmath4 and equals the unobservable temperature at the last scattering surface @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angular excursion of the photon as it propagates from the last scattering surface until the present . in terms of fourier components we have @xmath7",
    "the same relation applies to the two stokes parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 that describe linear polarization @xcite . in the small scale limit",
    "we take the direction of observation to be near @xmath10 and we orient the local coordinate system orthogonal to @xmath10 to define @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath8 is the difference between the photon intensities along @xmath11 and @xmath12 , while @xmath9 is the difference between photon intensities along the two diagonals . in terms of fourier components these can be expressed with opposite parity fourier components @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite @xmath15 \\nonumber \\\\ u({\\bi",

    "the correlations between the polarization variables are also a function of azimuthal angle @xmath21 @xcite .",

    "each segment of the ring will be mapped to a different position with angle @xmath21 where @xmath70 .",

    "the measured power in the @xmath1 mode is @xmath72 .",
    "this example shows that the pattern of polarization vectors on the sky determines the amount of @xmath2 and @xmath1 type polarization .",
    "lensing distorts this pattern by shifting the positions of the photons in the plane of the sky relative to the last scattering surface .",
    "it can thus generate @xmath1 pattern out of initially pure @xmath2 polarization . in the next section",
    "we discuss the amplitude of this effect .",
    "the effect of gravitational lensing on the temperature power spectrum has been studied in detail in previous work @xcite .",
    "we will explore here the effects on polarization and asses the detectability of the @xmath1 signal . in these examples",
    "we will use the cosmic concordance model @xcite with @xmath73 km s@xmath74mpc@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the model is cobe normalized and satisfies the constraints on 8 h@xmath74mpc scale from the abundance of clusters .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the functions that characterize the rms deflection of the photons , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . on small scales the rms relative deflection between two photons approaches 15% , justifying the weak lensing assumption over most of the sky ( for caustic formation one requires @xmath81 , which will occur only on rare occasions ) .",
    "we also show @xmath82 $ ] for @xmath83 .",
    "the two window functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 are very similar , making their difference much smaller than their sum .",
    "one thus expects the generated @xmath1 type polarization from a pure @xmath2 type ( and viceversa ) to be very small .",
    "in fact @xmath86 is also very similar , the three windows only differ at the 1% level .",
    "the windows are oscillatory as a function of @xmath49 and their main contribution is concentrated around @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] ( upper panel ) shows the lensed and unlensed power spectra . on intermediate scales",
    "lensing has the general effect of smearing the peaks in the spectrum by redistributing power .",
    "polarization receives contribution only from velocity gradients at the last scattering surface and the acoustic peaks are very sharp .",
    "in contrast , temperature receives contributions both from velocity and density of photon - baryon plasma and the two are out of phase with each other , leading to a partial cancellation of acoustic peaks .",
    "one thus expects the effect of lensing to be larger for polarization and indeed we find that it is approximately a factor of two larger for @xmath2 polarization ( figure [ fig2 ] , bottom left panel ) . in the damping tail",
    "the power is enhanced over the unlensed case as can be seen in the general trend in the relative difference between lensed and unlensed spectra ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .    to asses the detectability of the induced @xmath1 polarization we will focus on the plack mission .",
    "we assume that measurements of the temperature , @xmath2 type polarization and @xmath88 cross correlation have allowed the determination of the cosmological parameters accurately enough so that we know the approximate shape of the @xmath1 power spectra induced by lensing .",
    "we will attempt to determine just one parameter , the overall normalization of this @xmath1 signal , which expresses the overall effect of the matter fluctuations along the line of sight . if the signal to noise were large enough we could also attempt to determine the power spectrum of the lensing effect , by exploring the signal in @xmath1 as a function of @xmath87 .    the relative error on the overall amplitude of the induced @xmath1 component @xmath89 is @xmath90 @xmath91 is the fraction of observed sky which we take to be @xmath92 .",
    "we assume the noise and beam width to be @xmath93 and @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the effective number of modes contributing information is @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 . for the experimental specifications above @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this means that there are only 8 independent modes of @xmath1 type polarization that can be observed with planck , each a gaussian random variable with 0 mean and so the signal will be at the limit of detectability by planck .",
    "the @xmath1 signal peaks at @xmath100 and a ground based experiment observing a small patch of the sky for sufficiently long time to reduce the noise per pixel would be more effective to detect this signal .",
    "gravitational lensing induced @xmath1 is also not a significant contaminant of the @xmath1 polarization expected from tensor modes in inflationary models @xcite , the latter being dominant on large angular scales ( figure [ fig2 ] , bottom right panel , where we assumed tensors and scalars are of equal amplitude in the temperature on large scales ) .",
    "the change in the cmb spectra induced by random deflections of the photons by the large scale structure of the universe has to be included in the calculations of the anisotropies when comparing theory and observations .",
    "we have presented a formalism to calculate the effect of gravitational lensing on all four cmb power spectra .",
    "the final expressions are given in a compact and numerically efficient form that is adequate for numerical implementation .",
    "these expressions have been implemented in the cmbfast package , freely available from the authors .",
    "the computational time does not significantly increase with this feature and since the effect can be significant we feel the lensing effect should be included in any calculation where high precision accuracy is important , such as in the design and analysis of the cmb experiments .",
    "the method is self - consistent in the sense that for any cosmological model we use the actual power spectrum computed in the code to compute the lensing effect .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized to cobe using the cmb spectrum computed from the same code output .",
    "this approach gives the correct amplitude of gravitational lensing effect for the particular model in question .",
    "it should be pointed out that if the model is inconsistent with the small scale constraints such as @xmath101 normalization then the amplitude of the lensing effect will also be incorrect .",
    "for example , cobe normalized standard cdm has a much larger gravitational lensing effect than what we find using the cosmic concordance model , but this is only a reflection of standard cdm model having too much small scale power to be compatible with small scale constraints . for models that are correctly normalized on small scales the relative change of the polarization power spectra can reach 10% at @xmath102 and even more at higher @xmath87 .",
    "this is larger than in the temperature spectrum and is caused by the sharper acoustic peaks in the polarization spectra . in the damping region the lensed spectra show an enhancement above the unlensed spectra just like in the temperature case , although the sensitivity to this effect is too small for satellite missions to detect it in polarization @xcite .",
    "gravitational lensing also mixes @xmath2 and @xmath1 type polarization by deforming the polarization pattern on the sky relative to that at the last scattering surface",
    ". this will generate @xmath1 type polarization out of the @xmath2 type polarization even if there was no @xmath1 present at the last scattering surface .",
    "this induced @xmath1 mode is rather small in typical models and will be only marginally detectable by the planck surveyor .",
    "it peaks at fairly small angular scales around @xmath103 and so does not affect the measurement of gravity waves from @xmath1 polarization on larger scales . a ground based experiment observing a small patch of the sky would be more suitable to observe this effect and would allow one to determine the power spectrum of matter fluctuations .",
    "this would allow a detection of a combined gravitational effect from structures spanning a much larger range in redshift space than currently reachable by other methods .",
