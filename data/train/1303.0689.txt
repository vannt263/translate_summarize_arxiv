    "metamaterials are artificial structures with engineered electromagnetic ( em ) response that may exhibit unusual properties such as negative refraction  @xcite , image resolution beyond the diffraction limit  @xcite , optical magnetism  @xcite , em cloaking  @xcite , and slow light propagation  @xcite . one possible route to achieve negative refraction requires that the real parts of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability are simultaneously negative  @xcite .",
    "this condition can be achieved with metamaterials composed of periodic structures containing both electric and magnetic resonators  @xcite .",
    "another route for negative refraction involves single - resonance chiral metamaterials ( cmms ) , with neither electric permittivity nor magnetic permeability negative required  @xcite .",
    "although physically different , both routes explore resonant metamaterials , which are necessarily absorptive and dispersive .",
    "the em energy density in absorptive and dispersive media , which is crucial for many applications in photonics , was firstly derived for nonmagnetic materials  @xcite and then generalized for composite magnetic media  @xcite . for the particular case of wire - split ring resonator metamaterials ,",
    "there basically exist two methods to calculate the em energy density : the equivalent circuit  @xcite and the electrodynamic  @xcite approaches .",
    "these methods were shown to be non - equivalent and the apparent inconsistency between them has been solved in  @xcite . specially , this latter result has been recently used to calculate the em energy within a coated magnetic sphere  @xcite , an important geometry for applications in plasmonics . the methodology developed in  @xcite",
    "has been also employed to derive the em energy density stored in single - resonance cmms composed of uncoupled helical resonators  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , the case of the em energy within a dispersive sphere which is simultaneously chiral and magnetic , such as the cmm composites , has not been treated so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive an exact expression for the time - averaged em energy inside a cmm sphere and its connection to the absorption cross - section .",
    "based on the bohren s decomposition of the em field for optically active spheres  @xcite , we obtain the lorenz - mie solution for the internal fields in the magnetic case  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the behavior of internal resonances inside the sphere ( near - field ) and their corresponding resonances in the extinction efficiencies ( far - field ) .",
    "in particular , we derive an explicit expression for the absorption efficiency in terms of the internal em fields that reveals that strong chirality leads to an off - resonance field enhancement within weakly absorbing spheres .",
