    "the potential energy between two heavy quarks is a fundamental quantity in physics .",
    "in fact , the history of computing loop corrections to the potential of quarks forming a colour singlet configuration goes back to the mid - seventies with the idea to describe a bound state of heavy coloured objects in analogy to the hydrogen atom  @xcite .",
    "one - loop corrections were computed shortly afterwards in refs .",
    "the two - loop corrections have only been evaluated towards the end of the nineties by two groups  @xcite and about five years ago the three - loop corrections have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , again in two independent calculations .    in this paper",
    "we consider the potential in momentum space which we define as @xmath0}(|{\\vec q}\\,|)&= &    -{4\\pi c^{[c ] } \\frac{\\alpha_s(|{\\vec q}\\,|)}{{\\vec q}\\,^2 } }    \\bigg[1+\\frac { \\alpha_s(|{\\vec q}\\,| ) } { 4\\pi } a_1^{[c ] }      + \\left ( \\frac{\\alpha_s(|{\\vec q}\\,|)}{4\\pi}\\right)^2a_2^{[c ] }      \\nonumber\\\\&&\\mbox { }      + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha_s(|{\\vec q}\\,|)}{4\\pi}\\right)^3      \\left(a_3^{[c]}+ 8\\pi^2 c_a^3\\ln\\frac{\\mu^2}{{\\vec q}\\,^2}\\right )      + \\cdots\\bigg]\\ , ,    \\label{eq::v}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the eigenvalues of the quadratic casimir operators of the adjoint and fundamental representations of the @xmath3 colour gauge group , respectively .",
    "the strong coupling @xmath4 is defined in the @xmath5 scheme and for the renormalization scale we choose @xmath6 in order to suppress the corresponding logarithms .",
    "the general results , both in momentum and coordinate space , can be found in appendix  [ app::v ] .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq::v ] ) we have introduced the superscript @xmath7}$ ] which indicates the colour state of the quark - anti - quark system . in refs .",
    "@xcite only the singlet configurations ( @xmath8 ) have been considered , which is phenomenologically most important .",
    "however , quarks in the fundamental representation can also combine to a colour octet state . at tree - level and one - loop order",
    "only the overall colour factor changes from @xmath9}=c_f$ ] to @xmath10}=c_f - c_a/2 $ ] . starting from two loops",
    "@xcite the coefficients @xmath11}$ ] get additional contributions . in this paper",
    "we compute @xmath12}$ ] and compare the result to @xmath13}$ ]  @xcite .    the term proportion to @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq::v ] ) has its origin in an infra - red divergence which has been subtracted minimally .",
    "it appears for the first time at three - loop order  @xcite and is canceled against the ultraviolet divergence of the ultrasoft contributions which have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . as anticipated in eq .",
    "( [ eq::v ] ) , the ultrasoft contribution for the colour - singlet and colour - octet case differs only by the overall colour factor which is confirmed by our explicit calculation .",
    "let us for completeness mention that it is possible to generalize the concept of the heavy - quark potential to generic colour sources which in principle can also be in the adjoint representation of @xmath15 as , e.g. , the gluino in supersymmetric theories .",
    "various combinations of quark , squark and gluino bound state systems have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and the corresponding potential has been evaluated up to two loops .",
    "a further generalization of the three - loop corrections to @xmath16}$ ] has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is still assumed that the heavy sources form a colour singlet state , however , the colour representation is kept general .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we explain in detail how we treat the diagrams involving pinches .",
    "afterwards we present our results in section  [ sec::results ] and conclude in section  [ sec::conclusions ] .",
    "as compared to the singlet case the calculation of the octet potential is substantially more complicated which is connected to the occurrence of so - called pinch contributions as shall be discussed in the following .",
    "pinch contributions occur in those cases where a deformation of the integration contour , needed to circumvent poles in the complex plane of the zero - component of the integration momentum , is not possible .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in tab .",
    "[ tab::num ] we present numerical results for the coefficients of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) both for the singlet and the octet potential where for the number of light quarks , @xmath19 , we choose the values @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which corresponds to the charm , bottom and top quark case , and for the renormalization scale @xmath22 . at two - loop order one",
    "observes a compensation of the relatively large two - loop singlet contribution by the additional term present in the octet case .",
    "this term is @xmath19 independent which even leads to negative values for @xmath23}$ ] for @xmath24 .",
    "also at three loops the additional term is negative for all considered values of @xmath19 and leads to a significant reduction , for @xmath24 by more than a factor two .",
    "in this paper we have have computed the potential between two heavy quarks is a colour - octet configuration to three - loop order . the computation of the underlying integrals profits from the calculation of the singlet potential performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , in contrast to the singlet case the octet potential receives contributions form diagrams with pinches which significantly complicates the calculation .",
    "we discussed two algorithms which are used to obtain the pinch contributions by reducing the calculation to integrals without pinches .",
    "our final result is presented in eqs .",
    "( [ eq::a3a ] ) ,  ( [ eq::a3b ] ) ,  ( [ eq::delta_a3_8 ] ) and  ( [ eq::a3_tot ] ) .",
    "one observes quite some similarity to the singlet result .",
    "actually , expressing the coefficients @xmath13}$ ] and @xmath12}$ ] in terms of @xmath25 we observe that two out of five coefficients are identical .    as a physical application of the octet potential",
    "one can think of top quarks produced at hadron colliders in a colour - octet state .",
    "for the description of the threshold effects the octet potential serves as a crucial ingredient ( see , e.g. , refs  @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , that the precision of the current calculations does not yet require three - loop corrections to the potential . in a further possible application one could use @xmath26}$ ] in order to compare with lattice simulations of the potential .",
