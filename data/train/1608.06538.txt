    "two accumulation gates are used to induce a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a 12 nm wide si quantum well 37 nm below the surface and a set of depletion gates is used to form a single quantum dot in the 2deg , and a charge sensor next to this dot . the dot is tuned so it is occupied by just one electron .",

    "the valley splitting , @xmath1 , is comparable to the thermal energy , @xmath2 .",
    "microwave excitation applied to one of the gates oscillates the electron wave function back and forth in the dot , roughly along the @xmath3 axis ( fig .",
    "because of the local magnetic field gradient @xmath40.3 mt / nm @xcite , where @xmath5 is the component of the micromagnet field gradient perpendicular to the static magnetic field @xmath6 , the electron is then subject to an oscillating magnetic field @xcite and electron spin transitions can be induced when the excitation is resonant with the spin splitting .",
    "the spin - up probability @xmath7 in response to the microwave excitation is measured by repeated single - shot cycles ( see section iii.a of the supplemental material for details ) .",
    "the initialization and read - out procedures require a zeeman splitting exceeding @xmath8 , which here restricts us to working at @xmath9 mt .    when varying the applied microwave frequency and external magnetic field , we observe six distinct resonance peaks [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1b](a ) ] .",
    "the two resonances labeled ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , not resolved on this scale , are two intra - valley spin resonances , one for each of the two lowest - lying valley states that are thermally occupied @xcite .",
    "they exhibit a @xmath10 @xmath11s and rabi frequencies of order mhz .",
    "the two resonances labeled ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , similarly not resolved , arise from second harmonic driving of the two intra - valley spin flip transitions .",

    "we identify resonance ( 5 ) with the transition indicated with the red arrow in which both spin and valley(-orbit ) flip .",
    "it has the same field dependence as resonance ( 1 ) , but ( above 500 mt ) it is offset from resonance ( 1 ) by a fixed amount , which as we can see from fig .",

    "[ fig : fig1b](d ) .    in principle",
    ", coupling occurs between all of the dressed states due to the effective spin - orbit coupling in our edsr experiment . in practice however , the orbital - rabi frequency is two orders of magnitude larger than the spin - rabi frequency , so mode hybridization is only observed between resonance ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , resulting in the level repulsion .",
    "the magnitude of this repulsion provides a convenient way to determine the orbital - rabi frequency , which can not be measured directly due to the fast dephasing of the excited valley - orbit state ( see section iii ) . in sec .",
    "ii of the supplemental material , we estimate this rabi frequency to be about 0.2 ghz .",
    "we now examine the possible origin of the ten times larger line width of resonance ( 5 ) compared to that of the pure spin - flip resonances ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . given the partial valley nature of transition ( 5 ) and the strong valley - orbit coupling that is typical of si / sige quantum dots @xcite , a plausible candidate decoherence mechanism for this transition is electric field noise .    in order to study the sensitivity to electric fields of the respective transitions ,",
    "we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5](a ) the dependence of the frequency of resonances ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) on the voltage applied to one of the quantum dot gates , @xmath50 . clearly , resonance ( 5 ) exhibits a much greater sensitivity to gate voltage than resonance ( 1 ) : @xmath0 18.5 mhz / mv for @xmath12 , versus @xmath0 0.5 mhz / mv for @xmath13 .",
    "we also notice that the two resonance shifts as a function of @xmath50 have opposite sign , which indicates that different mechanisms are responsible . for resonance ( 1 ) , we believe that the dominant effect of the electric field is the displacement of the electron wave function in the magnetic field gradient from the micromagnets @xcite ( see section iii.b of the supplemental material ) .",
    "this effect also contributes to the frequency shift of resonance ( 5 ) , but presumably it is masked by the change in valley - orbit splitting ( @xmath1 ) resulting from the displacement of the electron wave function in the presence of interface disorder @xcite .",
    "for instance , moving the electron towards or away from a simple atomic step at the si / sige interface leads to a change of the valley - orbit energy splitting , as shown by the results of numerical simulations reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5](b , c ) @xcite .",
    "as expected , the simulations predict a minimum in the valley - orbit splitting when the wave function is centered around the atomic step , but interestingly it does not vanish , i.e.  the opposite signs for the valley - orbit splitting left and right of the atomic step do not lead to complete cancellation ( see section iv of the supplemental material for a more detailed description ) .",
    "the @xmath035 times greater sensitivity of the spin - valley transition frequency to electric fields may contribute to its ten times larger line width compared to the intra - valley spin transition .",
    "the line width of the intra - valley spin transition is believed to be dominated by the 4.7@xmath51 @xmath52si nuclear spins in the host material @xcite .",
    "the nuclear field also affects the spin - valley transition , but obviously only accounts for a small part of the line width here .",
    "we propose that the dominant contribution to the line width of resonance ( 5 ) is low - frequency charge noise .",
    "although not definitive , some evidence for this interpretation is found in fig .  [ fig : fig5](d ) , which shows a scatter plot of @xmath12 and one of the dot - reservoir tunnel rates , simultaneously recorded over many hours ( see section iii.c of supplemental material for a more detailed description of the measurement scheme ) .",
    "the dot - reservoir tunnel rate serves as a sensitive probe of local electric fields , including those produced by charges that randomly hop around in the vicinity of the quantum dot ( see fig .",
    "s6 ) @xcite .",
    "the plot shows a modest correlation between the measured tunnel rate and @xmath12 , suggesting that the shifts in time of both quantities may have a common origin , presumably low - frequency charge noise .    in this case",
    ", we can also place an upper bound on @xmath53 permitted by charge noise for the intra - valley spin transitions ( 1,2 ) in the present sample ( given the specific magnetic field gradient reported in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , due to the micro magnet induced gradient in the local magnetic field parallel to @xmath6 , the pure spin transitions are also sensitive to charge noise .",
    "given that @xmath54 110 ns for transition ( 5 ) and the ratio of @xmath0 35 in sensitivity to electric fields , charge noise in combination with this magnetic field gradient would limit @xmath53 to @xmath55 @xmath11s for transitions ( 1,2 ) .",
    "it is important to note that this is not an intrinsic limitation , as the stray field of the micro magnet at the dot location can be engineered to have zero gradient of the longitudinal component , so that to first order charge noise does not affect the frequency and @xmath53 of transitions ( 1,2 ) . at the same time , a strong gradient of the transverse component can be maintained , as is necessary for driving spin transitions .    besides its strong sensitivity to static electric fields , we report a surprising dependence of the frequency of resonance ( 5 ) on microwave driving power [ fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7](b , c ) ] .",
    "increasing the driving power , the resonance not only broadens but also shifts in frequency , as in an a.c .",
    "stark shift @xcite .",
    "this dynamical evolution is very different from the case of the intra - valley spin resonance , which is power broadened but stays at fixed frequency @xcite .",
    "this frequency shift is , at least for a limited microwave power range , in line with the dynamical level repulsion captured by eq .",
    "s42 , where @xmath56 expresses the energy splitting between resonance ( 5 ) and its asymptote , @xmath57 .",
    "this relation is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7](c ) for microwave powers of @xmath58 dbm .    finally , we attempt to drive coherent oscillations using resonance ( 5 ) at high applied microwave power , recording the spin excited state probability as a function of the microwave burst time .",
    "oscillations are not visible , indicating that the highest rabi frequency we can obtain for resonance ( 5 ) is well below the corresponding @xmath59 of 110 ns .",
    "this is consistent with our estimate that the rabi frequency is of the order of 10 khz , based on the magnitude of the dynamical level repulsion seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1b](a , b ) and the derivation in the section ii.b of supplemental material .",
    "despite its simplicity , the electrical driving of a single electron confined in a single quantum dot can produce a complex spin resonance energy spectrum .",
    "this particularly applies for quantum dots realized in silicon , where the presence of the excited valley - orbit state , close in energy and strongly coupled to the ground state , introduces a substantial non - linearity in the system response to microwave electric fields .",
    "this allows us to observe a transition whereby both the spin and the valley state are flipped at the same time .",
    "we demonstrate how both static external electric fields and electrical noise influence the frequency of this inter - valley spin transition , dominating its coherence properties .    much of the dynamics of the spin and valley transitions can be captured in a semi - classical picture , including driving using higher harmonics exploiting non - linearities .",
    "however , under intermediate or strong driving , new phenomena emerge that can not be easily explained except in terms of dressed states that fundamentally involve a quantum mechanical coupling between photons and orbital or spin states . here , we have provided experimental and numerical evidence for the existence of such dressed states of photons and valley - orbit states at strong driving .",
    "we have further estimated the strength of this valley - orbit to photon coupling by comparing our analytical theory to the experiments .",
    "this work provides important experimental and theoretical insight in the role of inter - valley transitions for controlling spin dynamics in silicon based quantum dots .",
    "it also highlights the limitations of valley - based qubits in the presence of strong valley - orbit coupling , due to their sensitivity to electrical noise .",

    "( iii ) the third competing effect is the confinement energy of the parabolic dot : when the electron center of mass moves to the left or right due to the step , this increases the average energy of the electron in the parabola . as shown in fig .",

    "the competition also makes it difficult to gain much intuition about the final results . without the competing effects",
    ", we would expect the valley splitting to go to zero as the ground state changes from ` even ' to ` odd ' in the valley parameter .",
    "but the electron always wants to maximize the energy splitting between the two eigenstates , and the competing effects ( in particular , the shifting of the electrons to the left and right ) allow it to keep a nonzero energy splitting at all times .",

    "<S> the valley degree of freedom is intrinsic to spin qubits in si / sige quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> it has been viewed alternately as a hazard , especially when the lowest valley - orbit splitting is small compared to the thermal energy , or as an asset , most prominently in proposals to use the valley degree of freedom itself as a qubit . here </S>",
    "<S> we present experiments in which microwave electric field driving induces transitions between both valley - orbit and spin states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this system is highly nonlinear and can be understood through the use of dressed photon - orbital states , enabling a unified understanding of the six microwave resonance lines we observe . </S>",
    "<S> some of these resonances are inter - valley spin transitions that arise from a non - adiabatic process in which both the valley and the spin degree of freedom are excited simultaneously . for these transitions , involving a change in valley - orbit state </S>",
    "<S> , we find a tenfold increase in sensitivity to electric fields and electrical noise compared to pure spin transitions , strongly reducing the phase coherence when changes in valley - orbit index are incurred . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to this non - adiabatic transition , the pure spin transitions , whether arising from harmonic or subharmonic generation , are shown to be adiabatic in the orbital sector . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linearity of the system is most strikingly manifest in the observation of a dynamical anti - crossing between a spin - flip , inter - valley transition and a three - photon transition enabled by the strong nonlinearity we find in this seemly simple system .    </S>",
    "<S> 1.5truecm    a spin-1/2 particle is the canonical two - level quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> its energy level structure is extremely simple , consisting of just the spin - up and spin - down levels . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when performing spectroscopy on an elementary spin-1/2 particle such as an electron spin , only a single resonance is expected corresponding to the energy separation between the two levels .    </S>",
    "<S> recent measurements have shown that the spectroscopic response of a single electron spin in a quantum dot can be much more complex than this simple picture suggests . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true when using electric - dipole spin resonance , where an oscillating electric field couples to the spin via spin - orbit coupling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , due to non - linearities in the response to oscillating driving fields , subharmonics can be observed @xcite , and the non - linear response can even be exploited for driving coherent spin rotations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , due to spin - orbit coupling , the exact electron spin resonance frequency in a given magnetic field depends on the orbital the electron occupies @xcite . in silicon or germanium quantum dots , </S>",
    "<S> the conduction band valley is an additional degree of freedom @xcite , and the electron spin resonance frequency should depend on the valley state as well @xcite . as a result , when valley or orbital energy splittings are comparable to or smaller than the thermal energy , thermal occupation of the respective levels leads to the observation of multiple closely spaced spin resonance frequencies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the picture becomes even richer when considering transitions in which not only the spin state but also the orbital quantum number changes . </S>",
    "<S> such phenomena are common in optically active dots @xcite , but have been observed also in electrostatically defined ( double ) quantum dots in the form of relaxation from spin triplet to spin singlet states @xcite and spin - flip photon - assisted tunneling @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , that work is all in semiconductor quantum dots with no valley degree of freedom , and the degree to which valleys -often treated as weakly coupled to each other and orbital states - couple to each other to enable microwave - driven transitions that change spin has not been explored . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the investigation of resonant transitions involving the valley degree of freedom is very important in the context of the new qubit architecture recently proposed for si quantum dots @xcite , based on the valley degree of freedom to encode and process quantum information .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we report transitions where both the spin and valley - orbit state flip in a si / sige quantum dot . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that we can stark shift the transitions , and we compare the sensitivity to electric fields to the case of pure spin transitions , including the impact on phase coherence . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the valley - orbit coupling strongly affects the coherence properties of the inter - valley spin resonances . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a theory incorporating a driven four - level system comprised of two valley - orbit and two spin states subject to strong ac driving provides a consistent description of these transitions , as well as all the previously reported transitions for this system . </S>",
    "<S> this theory also explains the observation of a dynamical level repulsion , which can be understood effectively and compactly using a dressed - state formalism . </S>"
