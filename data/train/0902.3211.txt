    "the interplay between disorder , frustration and quantum effects presents several challenging issues .",
    "for instance , the infinite - range ising spin - glass model in a transverse magnetic field has been studied with various techniques that show controversial results .",
    "it is well known that the classical sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model @xcite presents a continuous phase transition in which the spin - glass ( sg ) phase has the free energy landscape composed by many almost degenerated thermodynamic states separated by infinitely high barriers @xcite . the controversy is whether or not the quantum tunneling between free energy barriers activated by the transverse field is able to restore the replica symmetry ( rs ) in the infinite - range ising spin - glass model . @xcite . to answer this question ,",
    "the usual procedure is to investigate the behavior of the so - called replicon ( the transversal eigenvalue of the hessian matrix ) to check the local stability of rs solution .",
    "no much attention is given to the longitudinal eigenvalues since , as in the classical case , they would not give any additional important information in such an analysis @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is , at least , one formulation of the infinite - range ising spin - glass problem , the fermionic ising spin - glass ( fisg ) model @xcite , in which the role of the quantum effects on the longitudinal eigenvalues could also be important .",
    "the fisg model is defined by spin operators which are represented by bilinear combinations of fermion operators of creation and destruction .",
    "that makes this model a quite adequate framework to study the competition between spin - glass and , for instance , kondo effect or superconductivity . @xcite .",
    "those spin operators act on fock space with four states per site , two of them nonmagnetic .",
    "in fact , this model can also be formulated in two versions @xcite . in the first one ( @xmath2 model ) ,",
    "it is used a restriction in the number operator that eliminates the contribution of nonmagnetic states .",
    "that would be equivalent to study the problem in the spin space . in the second version ( @xmath3 model ) ,",
    "magnetic and nonmagnetic states are admitted . in this case ,",
    "an important aspect is the connection between spin and charge correlations @xcite . that can be seen clearly , for instance , in the relationship between @xmath4 ( the average of occupation of fermions per site ) and the diagonal replica matrix elements @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath3 model , variations of charge occupation can influence the magnetic properties not only leading the onset of the spin - glass phase , but also changing the nature of the phase boundary .",
    "for instance , the phase diagram of the @xmath3 model presents a tricritical point @xcite and a reentrance in the first order boundary phase for specific values of the chemical potential @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the mentioned connection can also appear in the behavior of longitudinal eigenvalues of the hessian matrix .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath3 model these eigenvalues present a non - trivial behavior , in which they become complex @xcite .",
    "the presence of a transverse field @xmath0 produces important changes in the phase diagram of @xmath2 and @xmath3 models . for instance , the increase of @xmath0 leads the freezing temperature ( @xmath6 ) of both models to a quantum critical point ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "particularly , for the @xmath3-model , when @xmath9 , the increase of @xmath0 not only depresses the second order part of @xmath6 and the position of the tricritical point but also destroys the reentrance in the first order part of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath0 induces quantum spin flipping mechanisms that affect the replica matrix elements strongly , in particular , the diagonal ones .",
    "because of that , @xmath0 could interfere in the replicon ( @xmath10 ) and , it should be remarked , in the longitudinal eigenvalues ( @xmath1 ) of hessian matrix for both @xmath2 and @xmath3 models .",
    "the previous discussion leads to the question : how exactly would @xmath0 affect @xmath1 in these two models ? in the @xmath2 model , the diagonal replica matrix elements become dependent on temperature when @xmath11 , which could reflect on the stability of the sg phase .",
    "thus , it can be a mechanism to change the behavior of @xmath1 since , at @xmath12 , this model reproduces the basic features of the classical sk one .",
    "one can also remark that @xmath0 in the @xmath2 model produces effects which are limited to the magnetic properties .",
    "nevertheless , that is not the case for the @xmath3 one . in this model",
    ", there is a mixing between spin and charge correlation functions which is important to determine not only magnetic properties @xcite but also charge ones @xcite . in this particular model , even for @xmath12 , the diagonal replica matrix elements have a relevant role for the sg solution when @xmath5 is increased , which can lead to a non - trivial behavior of @xmath1 , as discussed previously .",
    "consequently , one can expect that the combined effects of variations of @xmath0 and @xmath5 could enhance the non - trivial behavior of @xmath1 .",
    "actually , the variations of these independent parameters create a complicated interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom in which both magnetic properties and charge distribution , for instance , are affected .",
    "however , such redistribuition of charge can influence the magnetic correlation functions themselves . as a result",
    ", the behavior of @xmath1 in the @xmath3 model can be considerably more complicated than the @xmath2 one .",
    "therefore , the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail the rs stability for both the @xmath2 and @xmath3 models in the presence of a transverse magnetic field @xmath13 in particular , for the @xmath3 model , special attention is given to investigate effects of combined variations from @xmath0 and @xmath5 on @xmath10 and @xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , it is also obtained the behavior of @xmath4 inside the sg phase to clarify how spin and charge correlation functions influence each other . in order to accomplish these goals ,",
    "the partition function is obtained in the path integral formalism in which the spin operators are given as bilinear combinations of grassmann fields .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is found within the static approach ( @xmath14 ) and the one step replica symmetry breaking ( @xmath15 ) scheme , which allows to derive @xmath4 . in particular , to obtain the @xmath2 model , it is introduced the same restraint used in refs .",
    "@xcite to avoid the two nonmagnetic eigenstates .",
    "finally , the local stability of the @xmath16 solution is studied by obtaining @xmath10 and @xmath1 .",
    "the present work the static approach which neglects time fluctuations of spin - spin correlation functions is used @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the @xmath14 is unable to provide reliable quantitative results for the thermodynamics at very low temperature @xcite .",
    "however , it has also been shown by grempel and rozemberg @xcite that static ansatz gives reliable results when the temperature is not too low .",
    "in fact , the results found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the spin - spin correlation function @xmath17 indicate a behavior which is approximate to the same of their classical counterpart within an interval of temperature around a continuous @xmath18 transition . on the other hand ,",
    "when a first order transition is present , it would be expected that @xmath14 could produce naturally reasonable results around the transition @xcite .",
    "this interval of reliability for both kind of transition justifies the use of @xmath14 for purposes of this work .",
    "it is important to mention that the scenario described for the @xmath3-model when @xmath12 has been already found in another model .",
    "the classical ghatak - sherrington ( gs ) model @xcite is a particularly interesting example which displays a spin - glass first order phase transition @xcite . in the gs model , there are three distinct eigenvalues of the hessian matrix in the limit of number of replicas @xmath19 . as in the classical sk model @xcite ,",
    "the replicon ( @xmath10 ) is negative in the whole sg region .",
    "however , other two eigenvalues ( @xmath1 ) can be complex or negative @xcite .",
    "actually , there is a close relationship between gs and fisg models @xcite . in particular",
    ", the thermodynamics described in the gs model can also be found in the @xmath3-model , such as the reentrance in the first order boundary phase .",
    "this similarity of the thermodynamics between these two models is obtained by a mapping of their spin - glass order parameters equations , within the @xmath14 and rs solution , given by a relationship between the chemical potential @xmath5 and the anisotropic constant @xmath20 of the gs model @xcite . in that sense",
    ", the gs model can be a reference to check the correctness of results obtained in the @xmath3-model when @xmath21 .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows : in section [ formulation ] , the fisg model in a @xmath0 field is presented .",
    "the thermodynamic potential is obtained within the sa ansatz and @xmath15 solution . in this section , it is also done a detailed study of the local stability of the @xmath16 solution for the present fisg model .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to describe the numerical results .",
    "section [ conclusions ] is left for conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) is defined on the fock space where there are four states per site : one state with no fermion , two states with a single fermion and one state with two fermions .",
    "consequently , there are two nonmagnetics states .",
    "this work considers two models : the @xmath3 model that allows the four possible states per site and the @xmath2 model , which restricts the spin operators to act on a space where the nonmagnetic states are forbidden .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 model requires a restriction to remove the contribution of these nonmagnetic states .",
    "it can be obtained by computing only sites occupied by one fermion ( @xmath31 at every site ) in the partition function trace @xcite .    in this fermionic problem the partition function is expressed by use of the lagrangian path integral formalism in terms of anticommuting grassmann fields ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "the restriction in the 2s - model is obtained by using the kronecker delta function @xcite . therefore , adopting an integral representation for this delta function , one can express the partition function for both models in a compact form : @xmath34 where @xmath35\\phi_{j\\sigma}(\\tau ) - h\\left(\\phi_{j\\sigma}^ { * }   ( \\tau),\\phi_{j\\sigma}(\\tau)\\right ) \\right\\ } \\label{action},\\ ] ] @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the temperature ) , @xmath38 for the @xmath2-model or @xmath39 for the @xmath3-model , @xmath5 is the chemical potential and @xmath40 is the state number per site allowed in each model .",
    "now , it follows the standard procedures in which the replica method @xcite , @xmath41 is used to get the configurational averaged thermodynamic potential .",
    "the replicated partition function @xmath42 is then given by : @xmath43\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the replica index .",

    "( [ grandpot ] ) .",
    "the rs solution is recovered when @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "@xcite , that the condition @xmath104 would be enough to garantee the sg stability , the dominance of regions with @xmath105 and @xmath110 for certains values of @xmath0 and @xmath5 indicate clearly an additional instability to the sg solution which must be taken into account simultaneously with that one related with the replicon .",
    "surely , the reliability of some results are quite limited by the use of @xmath14 , particularly , those ones close to the @xmath7 . nevertheless ,",
    "in the first regime , the results show clearly that the tendency to decrease the region with @xmath102 , when @xmath0 is increased , can be observed even at higher temperature .",
    "this tendency would indicate that close to the @xmath7 the analysis of @xmath1 could also play a more important role .",
    "however , there is no doubt that it is needed to go beyond the sa to obtain a more conclusive result close to the @xmath7 . on the other hand , for the second regime",
    ", results are more conclusive .",
    "the effects of @xmath0 combined with the increase of @xmath5 give an additional instability at higher temperatures . this new instability",
    "is important , particularly , close to the first order boundary where the use of @xmath14 is not so limited as in the case of a continous transition @xcite .    to conclude , in this work , it has been studied in detail the behavior of @xmath1 in the fisg model as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "it has been presented several evidences indicating that these particular eigenvalues of the hessian matrix can be also source of problem to the local stability of the @xmath16 solution when @xmath0 increases .",
    "it is clear that this results are very much restricted to the fisg model .",
    "however , one can speculate whether or not others diferent formulations of infinite - range ising spin - glass model in a transverse magnetic field could experiment similar additional instabilities likewise those ones found in the @xmath2 model .",
    "one last comment must be done .",
    "although there are strong similarities between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 models in the first regime , it is not obvious that this similarity can be explained by the behavior of the @xmath4 which remains at the half - filling when @xmath0 increases .",
    "one alternative , would consist of adding to the model given in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) a local on site repulsive coulomb interaction with strength @xmath129 . therefore , in the limit @xmath130 , it would be possible to avoid locally the double occupation @xcite .",
    "this approach is currently under investigation .",
