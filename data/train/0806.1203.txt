    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity has motivated a considerable effort in physics of strongly correlated electronic systems , and many theoretical models have been proposed@xcite .",
    "the hubbard model @xcite is one of the simplest and more general description of an interacting electrons system on a lattice . in its simplest form , it includ the usual kinetic energy of electrons and the competition between the on - site electron - electron interaction .",
    "the standard hubbard model is defined by the second quantized hamiltonian @xcite :    @xmath0    the first term of the eqs(1 ) represents the kinetic energy of electrons , and each electron has a possibility of hopping between different lattice sites .",
    "@xmath1 is the annihilation operator of the electron at a lattice site @xmath2 with spin index @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4is the creation operator of the electron at a lattice site @xmath5 , so  @xmath6 is the hopping integral from the site @xmath2 to the site @xmath5 .",
    "the second term represents the intrasite coloumb interaction with energy @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number operator of electrons at the site @xmath5 with spin @xmath3 .",
    "recently , the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite , was used to resolve the standard hubbard model@xcite .",
    "the rpa is an approach which treats seriously the correlations of system , and attempt to minimise the system energy .",
    "the standard hamiltonian hubbard must be developed as function of the creation and annihilation operators of the pair particle - hole(p - h ) , because our rpa regroups the electrons system on pair : particle - hole .",
    "the application of rpa to standard hubbard gives non linear coupled equations , where the resolution is done by a scrpa@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider an extended hubbard model@xcite , where the intersite coulomb interactions are introduced .",
    "this model was shown to describe many interesting properties of high tc superconductors materials @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we apply the scrpa method to this extended hubbard model , and study the intersite interaction effect on the ground state and excitation energy of system .",
    "we show that the repulsive interaction between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms is the origin of  a supplementary conductivity of the system .",
    "the standard hubbard model with intrasite interaction explains some important physical phenomena like high - temperature superconductivity beenen , mott - transition@xcite . to explain other physical phenomena observed in different areas of the solid state physics like magnetic and transport properties , it is convenient to take into account also the intersite interaction resulting from original coloumb repulsion modified by the polaronic effect .",
    "the extended hubbard hamiltonian is then given bycalegari , grabiec :    @xmath9    u denotes the effective intrasite coloumb interaction .",
    "@xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) describes the effective intersite coloumb interaction between the electrons in the lattice sites i and j , with the same spins ( opposite spins ) . @xmath10 and @xmath12 are not necessary equal .",
    "the model(2 ) can not be solved in a general case .",
    "there is however , a special but non trivial case of finite number of sites , which possesses exact analytical solution@xcite .    in this work",
    "we will limit ourselves to a simple case , and will apply the general formalism of scrpa to the two sites problem .",
    "we consider a closed chain in one dimension , with periodic boundary conditions @xmath13 .",
    "our physical system is then equivalent to two neighbouring atoms containing a free electron .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .    in order to apply the approximation scrpa to the hubbard model ,",
    "it is necessary , first , to apply the hartree - fock approximation(hf ) to the hubbard model . in the hf method",
    ", we write the hamiltonian(3 ) as function of quasiparticles operators , wich allow us to obtain the excitation spectrum of independent quasiparticles .",
    "the states @xmath16 are defined as : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the annihilation operator of the mode @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is related to @xmath21with the usual fourier transformation :    @xmath22    k is the momentum of state @xmath23 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions suppose that @xmath24 . with this condition , eqs(4 )",
    "gives @xmath25 , which have two solutions in the first brillouin zone : @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "thus the hamiltonian is then written as : @xmath28 this expression shows that in the hf approximation , the physical system has two possible states @xmath16 and @xmath29 . @xmath16 ( @xmath29 ) is the hartree - fock ground state ( excited state ) , with the momentum : @xmath30 below ( and @xmath31 above ) the fermi momentum , and the excitation energy : @xmath32 ( and @xmath33 ) , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 . as in ref @xcite , we define the hf quasiparticle operators by : @xmath36 and  @xmath37 .",
    "we have then @xmath38 , for all k.    in normal ordering of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the hamiltonian@xmath41 becomes :    @xmath42    where    @xmath43",
    "@xmath44    with @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47 and @xmath48 take into account the correlation between the number operators of the type : @xmath49 in the ground state : @xmath26 ( below the fermi momentum ) and between the magnetic momentum operators of the type : @xmath50 in the excited state : @xmath27 ( above the fermi momentum).@xmath51",
    "in order to apply the formalism of scrpa to the hubbard model , it is convenient to use the particle - hole(ph - rpa ) approximation , which regroup the physical system on pair .",
    "we can then define the rpa excitation operator as :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 ) are the momentum below ( and above ) the fermi momentum .",
    "eqs(7 ) shows that the excitation in the ph - rpa is done only by the creation or ( annihilation ) of pair : particle - hole via the operator @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) with the amplitude @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the corresponding excited state of this excitation operator is @xmath59 , and the corresponding excitation energy is :    @xmath60 \\right ] \\left| rpa\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle rpa\\right| \\left [ q_{v},q_{v}^{^{\\dagger } } \\right ] \\left| rpa\\right\\rangle } \\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the vacuum of this rpa excitation operator : @xmath62    the minimization of @xmath63 leads to usual rpa equations of type :    @xmath64    with the relations of the orthonormality conditions of the set @xmath65 , we can express the elements of @xmath66 and @xmath67 by the rpa - amplitudes , and therefore we have a completely closed system of equations for amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for our problem , we consider only the excitation operators , which conserve the spin , where the excitation is done only by the creation or annihilation of the pair : particle - hole with the same spin .",
    "@xmath70    with @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the mean values @xmath74 are taken with respect to the rpa vacuum @xmath75 .",
    "the scrpa equation can then be written in the form :    @xmath76    where the scrpa matrix elements are given by :    @xmath77 \\right ] \\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    and    @xmath78 \\right ] \\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    the orthonormality relations of the set @xmath65 , give :    @xmath79    from the hamiltonian given in eqs(10 ) , we can writte the scrpa matrix elements as : @xmath80 ,  @xmath81 ,  where :    @xmath82 and @xmath83 where    @xmath84",
    "so , the ph - rpa matrix takes the form :    @xmath85    this ph - rpa matrix has two positive roots :    @xmath86    the corresponding eigenvectors are : @xmath87 \\ $ ] and@xmath88 $ ] , respectively . where    @xmath89    and    @xmath90    so , like the hf approximation , in ph - rpa , our system have tow excitation energies @xmath32and @xmath91 , but they are coupled .",
    "thus in this work , we solve a system of a coupled equations numerically by iteration leading to a scrpq solution which are quasi identical to the exact result .      to show the effect of intersite interaction on the energy of the system , we have studied th evolution of the ground state and excited energies in term of the interaction @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "in figure1 we plot the variation of the ground state energy @xmath94 as function of the two parameters of the intersite interaction @xmath92 and @xmath95       the result shows that the ground state energy is quasi independent on @xmath92 but , the variation of @xmath96 become more important when we introduce the intersite interaction with the opposite spins : @xmath93 .",
    "this results can be explained by the fact that the scrpa include only , for the fundamental state , the correlations between the particles with different spins * * : * * @xmath97    thus the only type of interaction wich is of interest is @xmath95 in the following we analyse the @xmath93 effect on the dynamics of system . in figure 2 and 3",
    "we plot the variation of the gorund state energy and the excitation energies of scrpa , respectively , as function of the repulsive intrasite interaction u for different values of the intersite interaction @xmath95    the results show that , when @xmath7 increases , the gap @xmath98 between the two excitation energies increases too , and so , the jump of electrons between these two states becomes more difficult .",
    "thus , we can conclude , that for a fixed value of u , while the intersite interaction is repulsive ( attractive ) , the gap @xmath99 becomes less ( more ) important .",
    "these remarks allow us to assume that repulsive interaction between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms is the origin of supplementary conductivity of the system .",
    "in this paper , the scrpa approximation was used to solve the extended hubbard model given in eqs(3 ) .",
    "the quality of the scrpa method has been investigated in a previous work by jemai@xcite , in which he has shown a remarkable agreement between scrpa method and excact results for the standard hubbard model . in our work , we have extended this technic to study the intersite interaction effects on the dynamics of the electrons in the two sites with @xmath100 .",
    "we have shown that the gap between the excitation energies : @xmath101 are correlated with the intersite interaction energy @xmath93 .",
    "this result allow us to suppose that the repulsive intersite interaction ( between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms ) is the origin of a supplementary conductivity of the system .",
    "in future work@xcite , we propose to solve the 4-sites case ( plaquette ) , which may be very important for the explanation of high @xmath102 superconductivity , by considering the many plaquette configurations in 2d .",
