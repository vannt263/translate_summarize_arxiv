    "according to theory , fluctuations of water density on sub - nanometer length scales obey gaussian statistics  @xcite , while those on larger length scales deviate significantly from this behavior  @xcite .",
    "the deviations at large length - scales reflect the fact that water at standard conditions lies close to water - vapor coexistence @xcite .",
    "a large enough repellent surface can therefore induce the formation of a water - vapor - like interface , and as such , the probability of water depletion is enhanced near such a surface . in particular , the presence of this liquid - vapor - like interface facilitates large fluctuations in its vicinity compared to that in the bulk .",
    "this perspective is at the heart of current ideas about hydrophobic effects @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use molecular simulations to further examine the validity of this perspective .",
    "we demonstrate marked similarities between water - vapor interfaces and water - oil interfaces for large enough oily surfaces with low radii of curvature .",
    "the fact that a purely repulsive hydrophobic surface induces the formation of a vapor - liquid interface is well - established @xcite .",
    "dispersive attractions between the hydrophobic surface and water can mask this effect , as the attractions move the interface to a mean position immediately adjacent to the hydrophobic surface .",
    "this removes any significant presence of vapor on average @xcite . as a result , it is difficult to detect the presence of a water - vapor - like interface by considering only the mean behavior of water density profiles .",
    "rather , the presence of this interface is more directly reflected in fluctuations away from those profiles @xcite , which motivates our focus here on the statistics of these density fluctuations .",
    "large length - scale water density fluctuations control pathways for assembling hydrophobically stabilized structures @xcite .",
    "several groups have studied the statistics of these fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this paper is distinguished from this earlier work by the fact that we report the statistics of large length - scale fluctuations , which are expected  @xcite to be fundamentally different from the small length - scale fluctuations studied in the earlier work .",
    "the central quantity to be examined is the probability for finding @xmath0 water molecules in a sub - volume @xmath1 , @xmath2 .",
    "hummer and pratt and their co - workers introduced the idea of studying this function as a route to understanding solvation @xcite . in pure solvent , large length - scale fluctuations are very rare .",
    "these are the fluctuations of interest here .",
    "therefore , to obtain reasonable statistical information , we must employ some form of biased non - boltzmann sampling  @xcite .",
    "the simulation setup and system details are described in the next section , after which we explain the specific sampling method that we employ .",
    "results are then presented , beginning with those for the length - scale dependence of fluctuations in bulk water , followed by a discussion of the effect of dispersive attractions between the water molecules and a hydrophobic surface .",
    "finally , we contrast fluctuations near a hydrophobic surface with those near a hydrophilic surface .",
    "our results are consistent both with the lum - chandler - weeks ( lcw )  @xcite theory for the length - scale dependence of hydrophobic effects and with recent computer simulation studies @xcite . in this sense",
    ", our results may seem unsurprising .",
    "this paper , however , is the first publication of computer simulation results demonstrating expectations of the lcw theory for fluctuations that deviate far from the mean in an atomistic model of water .",
    "density fluctuations of spc - e water @xcite in the canonical ensemble at 298k can be quantified using the lammps molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation package.@xcite specifically , we evaluate the probability , @xmath2 , of finding @xmath0 water oxygens in a probe volume of interest , @xmath1 .",
    "a straight - forward canonical ensemble simulation , with an average water density , @xmath3 g/@xmath4 , would suppress large density fluctuations . to avoid this suppression , a particle - excluding field",
    "is introduced on one surface of the simulation box , with the box large enough that the net density is less than the bulk liquid density . through this construction  @xcite",
    "we ensure that the bulk liquid remains in the center of the box , that it is at coexistence with its vapor phase , and that a free liquid - vapor interface acts as a buffer in the event of a large density fluctuation .",
    "solutes are placed near the center of the box , deep within the bulk liquid and far from the free water - vapor interface .    to model a hydrophilic solute",
    ", we consider water molecules within a particular sub - volume of bulk water , specifically a sub - volume of dimensions @xmath5 @xmath6 . taking a configuration of equilibrated bulk liquid , we immobilize those water molecules , which are within that considered sub - volume .",
    "the immobilized molecules are then the solute .",
    "since the surface of this idealized hydrophilic solute is made up of fixed water molecules in a configuration that is typical of bulk water , the surface is unlikely to disrupt the hydrogen bond network of the neighboring solvent .    to model a hydrophobic solute , we replace the fixed waters in our model of a hydrophilic solute with methane - like oily particles .",
    "these oily particles are uncharged and interact with the surrounding solvent water molecules via a standard water - methane lennard - jones potential .",
    "the resulting potential energy field expels water from the volume occupied by the solute .",
    "it also attracts water with dispersive interactions .",
    "the solute constructed in this way and a typical configuration of solvent water are shown in fig . 1 .    in order to study the effect of dispersive attractions on water - density fluctuations , the lennard - jones ( lj ) pair potential between the hydrophobic solute and the solvent",
    "is split into repulsive and attractive parts using the weeks - chandler - andersen ( wca ) prescription .",
    "@xcite the role of attractions can then be examined systematically with a scaling parameter @xmath7 , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the wca repulsive and attractive branches of the lj potential , respectively , @xmath11 and @xmath12kcal / mol were used as the lj parameters for the oily particles @xcite , and lorentz - berthelot mixing rules were used to obtain water - solute interaction parameters .",

    "we have found it convenient to use @xmath29 kcal / mol .",
    "simulating our system in the presence of this umbrella potential allows us to bias the system towards configurations with @xmath26values near @xmath30 . when @xmath30 differs substantially from the mean value for the dynamical variable",

    "nevertheless , these configurations can be accessed reversibly through a series of simulations that slowly change the control variable @xmath30 .    by influencing the coarse - grained number of particles in the probe volume",
    ", the control variable @xmath30 also influences the actual number of water molecules in that volume .",
    "we have picked a small value of the coarse graining length @xmath23 to ensure that the latter influence is significant . as a result , with a series of simulations with different values of @xmath30 , histograms for both the coarse grained number and the actual number can be collected and then unbiased and stitched together within the framework of the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham )  @xcite .",

    "there is a maximum in the density profile accompanied by layering . further increasing the attractions leads to a more pronounced maximum and layering .",
    "this behavior is in accord with the predictions of lcw theory  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , contrary to lcw theory , it has been suggested that a layered density profile implies an absence of a liquid - vapor - like interface near an extended hydrophobic surface with dispersive attractions to water.@xcite .",
    "the source of this incorrect impression is that the mean density by itself is not an indicator of liquid - vapor - like interfaces .",
    "interfaces are relatively soft so that a weak perturbation can affect the location of the interface and thus the mean density profile while not destroying the interface . in other words , in order to fully appreciate the effect that a hydrophobic solute has on the surrounding solvent , one has to look at not only at the mean density but also at the density fluctuations .     for probe volumes near hydrophobic solutes with different @xmath7 values .",
