    "a completely random real state follows a goe statistics .",
    "the universal part of the spectrum at @xmath33 also follows a goe distribution .",
    "the definition of the order parameter in this letter required a protocol for determining the point @xmath48 which separates the non - universal part ( @xmath115 ) from the universal ( @xmath116 ) part of the rank - ordered entanglement levels .",
    "we use the following protocol : we took the spectrum obtained from each random state considered and multiply it by a factor @xmath117 such that the rescaled smallest singular value coincided in value with that obtained from a completely random state .",
    "then we swept through the spectrum , starting from the tail , and computed the relative deviation from the completely random state prediction , until it exceeded a certain amount .",
    "that is , until @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a number of order 1 . in our case",
    ", we set @xmath120 .    however , we would like to point out one subtlety of this methodology . in cases where the universal component of the spectrum almost vanishes near the transition",
    ", it is hard to accurately locate the critical point .",
    "that is because the last few points at the tail of the spectrum show large sample - to - sample fluctuations , and our protocol requires strictly matching a single point close to the tail .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 can be very sensitive to our choice of the matching point and can even yield incorrect predictions under finite - size scaling . on the other hand , we find that in cases such as the qrem , where there is still a large fraction of the universal component at the transition , this methodology is not very sensitive to the choice of matching point .",
    "for the heisenberg model , we locate the critical point @xmath48 by choosing the matching point away from the tail end , thus effectively discarding the smallest eigenvalues .",
    "for example , for @xmath30 we discarded the last 16 eigenvalues . in order to demonstrate that this does not lead to a sizable errors in determining the mbl critical point",
    ", we also computed the the order parameter directly from the _ averaged _ entanglement spectrum , where the fluctuations are smoothened out ( fig .",
    "[ add ] ) .",
    "the critical point found this way is very close to the one we show in the main text .",
    "we believe that the result can be further improved if more realizations are include in the averaring , which we hope to attempt in the future .",
    "in this section , we present in fig . [ fig:3 ] through fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the entanglement spectra for the qrem and two rk - type toy models that were discussed in the main text .",
    "we clearly see the following : ( 1 ) the two - component structure shows up in all three cases ; ( 2 ) the same evolution behavior as explained in the main text happens here as well .",
    "namely , the universal fraction shrinks as one increases the strength of disorder , thereby pushing the states further away from completely random states .",
    "we also show the order parameter for the qrem at energy density @xmath57 , which is different from the one shown in the main text .",
    "we clearly see from fig .",
    "[ fig : qrem ] that the curves for different system sizes cross at around @xmath121 , which is again in excellent agreement with previous known results .",
    "in this section , we view the emergence of the non - universal component in the entanglement spectrum from a different perspective : the degree of randomness in the wavefunctions .",
    "the physical intuition can be understood as follows .",
    "a completely random state is supposed to yield a marchenko - pastur distribution in its entanglement spectrum , i.e. only the universal component exits .",
    "this implies that for states whose entanglement spectra deviate from marchenko - pastur distribution , they can not be completely random .",
    "therefore we construct another toy model which captures this feature , by borrowing ideas from spin glasses .",
    "first let us start with a truly random ( real ) wavefunction that we denote by @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the sign function and @xmath124 are identically independently distributed with probability @xmath125 , with @xmath42 being the number of spins .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath126 is , by construction , random .",
    "the subscript rem is used to draw an analogy to the random energy model ( rem ) in spin glass systems@xcite .",
    "next , we note that the rem is a limiting case of a spin glass with @xmath127-spin interactions as @xmath128 , which eliminates correlations between configurations .",
    "so we can take a step back and consider the following `` less random '' sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) spin glass model with infinite - range two - spin interactions @xcite , and construct the following wavefunction : @xmath129 where the @xmath130 are drawn from uniform distribution in the interval @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the amplitudes computed from the sk - like model are obviously not as random as in the rem - like one ; there are only @xmath132 independent random @xmath130 s in the former as opposed to @xmath22 independent random amplitudes in the latter .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitudes of @xmath133 do inherit some randomness from the @xmath130 , and the energy distribution of the sk - like model also follows accurately a gaussian distribution for any _ one _ given @xmath134 , similarly to those in the rem - like model .",
    "but the correlations between the amplitudes for _ different _ @xmath134 exist in the case of the sk - like model , and these correlations are manifest in the entanglement spectrum computed from @xmath133 , as shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "<S> nevertheless , the page entropy is often an overestimate of the actual entanglement entropy computed from generic quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a natural question that arises is as follows : how random does a given quantum state look ? in this letter , we show that a generic quantum state that satisfies eth does not necessarily mean a completely random state . </S>",
