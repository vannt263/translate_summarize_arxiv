    "some galaxies , despite of their simple morphologies , can reveal to be very complex sistems from a kinematic point of view .",
    "clear examples are objects with stars and/or gas in orthogonal rotation with respect the rest of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or with a warped inner structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) . among these galaxies with multi - spin components ,",
    "_ counter - rotating galaxies _ are those that host two components that rotate in opposite directions from each other .",
    "these peculiar objects have been observed from in all morphological types .",
    "they are classed by the nature ( stars vs. stars , stars vs. gas , gas vs. gas ) and size ( counter - rotating cores , rings , and disks ) of the counter - rotating components ( see @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "the subject of this work is the peculiar case of galaxies hosting two counter - rotating stellar disks of comparable size .",
    "the prototype of this class of objects is the famous e7/s0 galaxy ngc  4550 , whose counter - rotating nature was first discovered by @xcite .",
    "the study of the kinematics and the stellar population of the two counter - rotating components are the key to understand the formation mechanisms of these objects .",
    "this task is complicated by the fact that the two components are co - spatial , and therefore we observe their combined contribution at each position on the sky .",
    "thus , it is necessary to separate their contribution to the total observed galaxy spectrum and measure the properties and kinematics of their stellar populations separately . to this aim",
    "we developed a spectroscopic decomposition technique and successfully applied to three spiral galaxies with counter - rotating stellar disks @xcite .",
    "we observed with the visible multi object spectrograph ( vimos ) integral - field unit at the very large telescope ( vlt ) three spiral galaxies , which are known to host counter - rotating stellar disks : ngc  3593 @xcite , ngc  4550 @xcite , and ngc  5197 @xcite .",
    "our spectroscopic decomposition technique exploits the differences in kinematics and stellar populations of the two components to separate their contribution from the combined observed spectrum . at each position on the galaxy , the code builds two synthetic templates ( one for each stellar component ) as linear combination of spectra from an input stellar library , and convolves them with two gaussian line - of - sight velocity distributions with different kinematics .",
    "gaussian functions are also added to the convolved synthetic templates to account for ionized - gas emission lines ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , [ o iii ] , and [ n i ] ) .",
    "the spectroscopic decomposition code returns the spectra of two best - fit stellar templates ( that represent the two stellar disks ) and ionized - gas emissions , along with the best - fitting parameters of luminosity of each component , velocity , and velocity dispersion .",
    "the line strength of the lick indices of the two counter - rotating components are measured on the two best - fit stellar templates .",
    "the line strength of the absorption line indices are then used to infer the age , metallicity , abundance ratios , stellar mass - to - light ratio , and the stellar mass of the two stellar components .",
    "we successfully separated the contribution of the ionized gas and the two stellar components from the observed spectrum , and confirm the presence of two counter - rotating stellar disks in ngc  3593 .",
    "more details on this galaxy and other galaxies in our sample are in @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig:003_1 ] shows the observed field of view , the 2-dimensional velocity fields of the stellar and ionized gas components , and the line strength of the absorption line indices ( h@xmath1 , mg  _ b _ , [ mgfe ] , and @xmath2fe@xmath3 ) . fig .",
    "[ fig:003_2 ] shows the 2-dimensional maps of the age , metallicity and @xmath4-enhancement , and their radial profiles .",
    "[ fig:003_3 ] shows the radial profiles of the stellar mass - to - light ratio and the mass of the two components .",
    "the secondary disk is on average less luminous and less massive than the main stellar disk , and it rotates along the same direction as the ionized gas component .",
    "the two counter - rotating stellar components have different stellar populations .",
    "the secondary stellar disk is younger , more metal poor , and more @xmath4-enhanced than the main galaxy stellar disk .",
    "the age difference between the two components is higher within 500 pc : the main component is @xmath5 gyr old , whereas the secondary component is @xmath6 gyr old . from the difference in age of the two components , we are able to date the formation of the counter - rotating stellar disk to @xmath72 gyr ago , i.e. @xmath71.6 gyr after the formation of the main galaxy disk .",
    "both components have high metallicity in the central 150 pc followed by a declining profile .",
    "the main component is on average more metal rich ( @xmath8_1=-0.04\\pm0.03 $ ] ) than the secondary component ( @xmath9_2=-0.15 \\pm0.07 $ ] ) .",
    "our results rule out internal processes , such as bar dissolution , since they would lead to the formation of two counter - rotating disks with the same properties .",
    "external acquisition of gas followed by star formation , or mergers of two galaxies with similar mass are both viable mechanisms .",
    "the accretion scenario predicts that the secondary component is the younger , and that the two components have different metallicity , as they are formed from different gas clouds . in the second scenario ,",
    "the properties of the two stellar component depend on the properties of the merging systems and star formation episodes triggered by the merger ."
