    "over the last decades , there has been a surge in research activities in the physical properties of biopolymers , such as double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) , filamental actin ( f - actin ) and microtubules .",
    "semiflexibility is a common feature they share : they preserve mechanical rigidity over a range , characterised by the persistence length @xmath2 , along their contour .",
    "( e.g. , for a dsdna , f - actin and microtubules , @xmath3 nm @xcite , @xmath4 m @xcite and @xmath5 mm @xcite respectively . )",
    "recently , two of us introduced a bead - spring model for semiflexible polymers @xcite .",
    "the model has four parameters .",
    "three of them determine the mechanical properties : the average inter - bead distance @xmath6 , the longitudinal stiffness @xmath7 , and the bending stiffness @xmath8 .",
    "the fourth parameter is related to the viscosity of water @xmath9 and sets the time scale . in earlier work",
    "@xcite we determined a set of values for the first three parameters that are able to reproduce the mechanical properties of double - stranded dna in experiment , and we studied the canonical averages of a number of equilibrium properties . in most of the present paper ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the same set of parameter values .    in this paper",
    ", we primarily discuss how the equations of motion of our model can be efficiently integrated in time .",
    "there is no hydrodynamic interactions among the beads .",
    "this is in fact not a problem when it comes to comparing to experimental results for dsdna segments up to a few persistence lengths , since at these lengths a semiflexible polymer does not form a coil , and therefore should be free - draining .",
    "indeed , this is the feature that allows us to meaningfully compare the diffusion coefficients of short model dsdna segments to those from experiments , from which we determine the fourth ( and the last ) parameter of the model , @xmath9 , which describes the langevin friction on the beads .    the default simulation approach to integrate the corresponding langevin equations of motion in time for",
    "our model would be a simple integration scheme such as the euler method , using the bead positions as dynamical variables . in this paper",
    "we develop a time - forward integration scheme by using the properties of ( a very good approximation of ) the polymer s fluctuation modes in this model @xcite , and allowing a set of representative equilibrium and dynamical observables to differ by at most 5% , we achieve 2 - 3 orders of magnitude speed - ups in comparison to the default method . with average inter - bead distance @xmath10 nm as a model parameter",
    ", the length of a dsdna basepair , the maximum size @xmath11 of the time step is summarised in table [ table0 ] .",
    "the variation in @xmath12 with @xmath13 does not have significant consequences since @xmath12 enters the dynamical equations only in the form of @xmath14 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath15 with increasing @xmath13 , on the other hand , has much more severe consequences on the dynamics , as it makes the chain effectively more inextensible .",
    "in contrast to dsdna one already runs into  even for fairly mild coarse - graining  quite small values of @xmath15 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath16 , which would mean about 75 beads per persistence length , the value of @xmath15 is so small that for all practical purposes our model behaves ( except of course the force - extension curve ) as the inextensible wlc , and our maximum time - step then would then be @xmath17 .",
    "even more interesting is the ratio between the real time and the scaled time involving the @xmath13-dependent parameters [ c.f .",
    "( [ g2a ] ) ] : @xmath18 e.g. , even with a small maximal allowable timestep @xmath19 the large value of @xmath20 for @xmath16 leads to @xmath21 this is orders of magnitude larger than the order of picosecond estimates for @xmath22 for dsdna ."

    "<S> using a recently developed bead - spring model for semiflexible polymers that takes into account their natural extensibility , we report an efficient algorithm to simulate the dynamics for polymers like double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) in the absence of hydrodynamic interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the dsdna is modelled with one bead - spring element per basepair , and the polymer dynamics is described by the langevin equation . </S>",
    "<S> the key to efficiency is that we describe the equations of motion for the polymer in terms of the amplitudes of the polymer s fluctuation modes , as opposed to the use of the physical positions of the beads . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , within an accuracy tolerance level of @xmath0 of several key observables , the model allows for single langevin time steps of @xmath1 , 8 , 16 and 16 ps for a dsdna model - chain consisting of 64 , 128 , 256 and 512 basepairs ( i.e. , chains of 0.55 , 1.11 , 2.24 and 4.48 persistence lengths ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , in one hour , a standard desktop computer can simulate 0.23 , 0.56 , 0.56 and 0.26 ms of these dsdna chains respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to those obtained from other methods , in particular , the ( inextensible discretised ) wlc model . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , we demonstrate that at the same level of discretisation , i.e. , when each discretisation element is one basepair long , our algorithm gains about 5 - 6 orders of magnitude in the size of time steps over the inextensible wlc model . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show that our model can be mapped one - on - one to a discretised version of the extensible wlc model ; implying that the speed - up we achieve in our model must hold equally well for the latter . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the use of the method by simulating efficiently the tumbling behaviour of a dsdna segment in a shear flow . </S>"
