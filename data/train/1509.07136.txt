    "is mediated by the interaction between holes and mn spins @xcite .",
    "as the magnetic interactions are mediated by charged carriers , the control of the magnetic properties can be achieved by electrical and optical means @xcite .",
    "much of the research efforts have been concentrated on ( iii , mn)v bulk or in its heterostructures where both mn and holes are in the same spatial region .",
    "these structures allow a high ferromagnetic curie temperature due to the strong interaction between the hole gas and the mn ions . however , the hole gas is strongly scattered by the mn ions , reducing its mobility and the optical quality . to overcome this difficulty , the ( ga , mn)as layers were grown in the presence of a quantum well , as for example in a gaas-(in , ga)as-(ga , mn)as sequence . in this situation ,",
    "the hole gas is located in the quantum well , separated from the mn ions which need to be controlled in order to maintain a certain level of overlap between the holes and the mn ions to assure the magnetic properties .",
    "recently , such heterostructures have been investigated by means of transport @xcite and optical experiments @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that the interaction between holes and mn is determinant for these systems properties .",

    "the samples were @xmath3-doped with mn in order to increase the mn doping concentration beyond the solubility limit .",
    "the presence of the @xmath3-doped c layer in the other side of the qw aimed to increase the hole gas concentration and , with that , to increase the magnetic effects .",
    "they observed that the circularly polarized magneto - photoluminescence presents strong oscillations with the magnetic field and they are more pronounced in the samples with higher mn concentration .",
    "these oscillations were attributed to the landau level filling factor .",
    "magneto - oscillations of the circularly polarized emission were also observed in both two - dimensional electron ( 2deg ) and hole gas ( 2dhg ) @xcite .",
    "the origin of these oscillations is in the many - body effects of both the two - dimensional gas @xcite and in the optical recombination process @xcite .",
    "the oscillations of the transition energies observed in ref .",
    "are much stronger than those observed in other high quality 2dhgs @xcite .",
    "these oscillations were correlated to the presence of mn spins in the heterostructure .",
    "several other experiments such as low - magnetic field circularly polarized , photoluminescence excitation and time - resolved photoluminescence @xcite and transport measurements @xcite , were performed in similar heterostructures .",

    "the model heterostructure investigated is illustrated in fig .",

    "it is composed by a 500 nm gaas buffer layer , a carbon ( c ) @xmath3-doping layer , followed by 10 nm gaas spacer , a 10 nm in@xmath4ga@xmath5as layer , a gaas spacer @xmath6 , a mn @xmath3-doping layer with a concentration @xmath7 given in percentage of monolayers ( mls ) , and finally a 60 nm gaas top layer .",
    "the distance @xmath6 between the qw and the mn doping layer and the mn concentration will be considered as free parameters in our model to study the effects of the mn interaction .",
    "all the others parameters are fixed . as a consequence of the mn and c @xmath3-doping and the thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "the qw presents a 2dhg .",
    "we consider the system under an external magnetic field applied along the growth direction , here the @xmath8-direction .",

    "the alloy is treated in the virtual crystal approximation . in general to obtain the valence band ( vb ) states it is necessary to use the six - band luttinger - kohn hamiltonian @xcite that describes the heavy - hole ( _ hh _ ) , light - hole ( _ lh _ ) and split - off ( _ so _ ) bands and the coupling among them as well as the spin - orbit effects @xcite . however , in our system , the in@xmath4ga@xmath5as layer is under compressed stress which splits the _ hh _ and the _ lh _ bands by a value of the order of 50 mev .",
    "the _ lh _ band is actually a type - ii or marginally type - i heterostructure , depending on the parameters chosen to describe the structure .",
    "this results in a near parabolic dispersion for the _ hh _ qw ground state for the energies of interest to study the optical emission .",
    "we therefore simplify our approximation considering a simple parabolic dispersion and tested it against a full luttinger hamiltonian calculation at zero magnetic field .",
    "the comparison is very good for the ground state responsible for the optical emission .",
    "as we go for the excited states , some discrepancies may be present but they do not alter the main results we show here .",
    "the many - body effects of the 2dhg are considered within the sdft @xcite .",
    "this allows us to calculate the ground - state properties of the 2dhg including exchange and correlation ( xc ) effects in the presence of a spin - dependent potential .",
    "we employed the kohn - sham minimization scheme @xcite to obtain the electronic structure .",
    "this procedure maps the many - body problem in a set of non - interacting equations , which are solved self - consistently .",
    "we approximate the sample as being homogeneous in the plane .",
    "the @xmath8-direction and the in - plane ( @xmath9 ) directions are therefore not coupled .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath10 where the first term is the @xmath8-part of the hamiltonian and the second term is the in - plane hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath11-part of the hamiltonian is responsible for the formation of the landau levels ( lls ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian in the @xmath8-direction is @xmath12 the first term is the kinetic energy , the second is the heterostructure potential , the third and fourth terms are the hartree and xc potentials , respectively .",
    "the fifth is the zeeman contribution , and lastly , the hole - mn ( h - mn ) coupling .",
    "we will now describe each of the hamiltonian terms in details .",

    "the band alignment is type - i .",
    "as the qw is strained , its total band offset contains both the band gap alignment and strain contributions .",
    "we first define a band offset without strain @xcite . in this case , we assume a vb ( cb ) offset , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) of 15% ( 85% ) of the energy gap difference . @xcite .",
    "our system is dominated by the gaas layers and we assume that the whole structure presents the gaas lattice parameter .",
    "this generates a compressive biaxial strain in the ga@xmath5in@xmath4as layer , which alters the qw band offset @xcite .",
    "if we neglect the _ so _ band , @xmath16 , the effect of the compressive biaxial strain is manifested in an hydrostatic term ( @xmath17 ) , which increases the gap , and a shear deformation ( @xmath18 ) , which splits the _ hh _ and _ lh _ bands @xcite .",
    "the deformation potential for the hydrostatic term can be split in a contribution to the conduction band , @xmath19 and one to the valence band , @xmath20 .",
    "the final result is a qw and a barrier potential for the _ hh _ and _ lh _ bands in the ga@xmath5in@xmath4as , respectively .",

    "one additional difficulty is that the mn strongly diffuses towards the surface in the gaas as it was shown from secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) @xcite .",
    "based on the sims results , instead of considering a mn @xmath3-doping layer , we assumed that the total mn is distributed over many gaas layers , forming a ga@xmath31mn@xmath32as alloy . to take this effect into account",

    "we construct a distribution function that takes in account the mn diffusion in the gaas @xcite .",
    "the sims results show that the mn diffuses following an approximate gaussian - like function in both directions of the heterostructure",

    "we will neglect this term in our calculations . within our description the electron - hole correlation potential should not present a dependence with the spin - polarization of the hole gas , but only on the total hole gas density .",
    "therefore , the main effect of this contribution will depend on the total charge transfer between the hole reservoirs of the heterostructure which plays a minor effect in most of our results ( see next section ) .    _ optical transitions _ - the transition energy is calculated as the energy difference between the electron and hole eigenstates .",

    "we consider @xmath106 @xmath107 which is the value obtained by fitting the measured hole concentration in the qw for a sample without mn and comparing with our calculations @xcite .",
    "the nominal concentration of mn , @xmath7 , is known from the growth process .",
    "however , it does not provide the real hole density , since mn can be either a substitutional impurity or an interstitial one @xcite . in the first case mn",
    "replaces ga , and provides one hole to the system , while at the interstitial position it is a double donor , and gives two electrons .",
    "therefore , there is a self - compensation of holes by the electrons , and the total density of holes provided by the mn is given by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the concentration of substitutional and interstitial mn , respectively @xcite .",
    "furthermore , because of the attractive coulomb interaction , the interstitial mn ions tends to be near to the substitutional ones presenting an antiferromagnetic coupling , which reduces the net mn spins @xcite .",

    "these oscillations did not change the cb lls dependence with the magnetic field and they show the same behavior for both spins .",
    "this is expected because the electron spin does not interact with the hole spin via exchange interaction , and also the _ s - d _ exchange coupling cause only a rigid energy shift at large magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the observed oscillations have their origin in the charge transfer between the c layer and the qw , as it will be discussed bellow .",
    "we remind that the electron - hole correlation was not taken into account in our model .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath125 t. let us concentrate on @xmath126 and @xmath127 states .",
    "they are the more important states for the emission spectra .",
    "in particular , for @xmath128 t , @xmath126 state shows an almost flat dependence with the magnetic field while @xmath127 state shows a stronger one .",
    "the origin of this behavior is three fold : the zeeman effect , _ p - d _ interaction , and the spin - polarization of the hole gas , which is enhanced by the hole - hole exchange energy . for low magnetic fields the spin - up and spin - down hole densities",
    "are nearly the same , and hence , the 2dhg spin - polarization does not influence its magnetic field dependence ( see discussion below for high - magnetic fields , where this contribution is important ) . also , in this regime , the zeeman energy is small and its effect is to split the _",

    "the magnetic field dependence of @xmath126 and @xmath127 states again differ significantly , repeating the previous pattern .",

    "this is a consequence of the _ sp - d _ interaction . at higher magnetic - fields this splitting is superimposed by opposed oscillations originated from the qw holes lls oscillations .",
    "we observe that the non - linear behavior for the @xmath98 transition increases as the qw hole gas starts to be polarized reaching a maximum value when the hole gas is spin - polarized . as this polarization starts to decrease , the non - linear behavior for @xmath98 decreases .",
