    "the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) driven by electron interaction , the so - called mott transition ,  @xcite is one of the most challenging issues in modern solid state physics , especially because of its possible connections with other phenomena , like high - temperature superconductivity .",
    "the prototypical model to study the mit is the one - band hubbard model , where the transition shows up if the ratio between the bandwidth @xmath0 and the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath1 is varied .",
    "@xcite in a pioneering work , brinkman and rice  @xcite argued that the mit could be continuous , however , their approach led to a mott insulator where charge fluctuations are completely frozen .",
    "recent developments , based on dynamical mean - field theory calculations ,  @xcite are able to give a more realistic description of the mit where , at zero temperature , a wide gap in the excitation spectrum opens immediately in the insulator .",
    "however , within this approach , the role of the dimensionality is not taken into account , whereas its relevance comes out from recent experiments on si mosfet s  @xcite and organic materials .",
    "@xcite moreover , the situation can be radically different whenever the hamiltonian contains a true long - range coulomb interaction , as pointed out in the original mott argument .",
    "@xcite    in this work , we focus our attention on a correlated wave function ( wf ) , which is expected to closely describe the mit in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems with long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "the important fact is that , in the strong - coupling regime , we can adiabatically connect our wf with the fully - projected one , usually considered to describe systems in the limit of infinite coulomb repulsion , e.g. , the so - called resonating valence - bond state .",
    "@xcite moreover , the metallic phase has no quasiparticles defined , showing low - energy properties similar to the one - dimensional luttinger liquid .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ mapping ] we show the mapping between the quantum wave function and a classical model at finite temperature and in sec .  [ results ] we show our numerical results and we draw the conclusions .",
    "let us discuss how to construct a wf for correlated insulators . in general , starting from the ground state @xmath2 of a system with @xmath3 electrons , with energy @xmath4 , it is possible to construct simple variational states for the lowest - energy excitations .",
    "for instance , in analogy with the feynman s construction for the liquid helium ,  @xcite the plasmon excitation with momentum @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the fourier transform of the local electron density .",
    "its variational energy is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ground - state kinetic energy per particle and @xmath10 is its static charge structure factor .",
    "when applied to an insulator , with gapped charge excitations , this implies that , for small momenta , @xmath11 .",
    "this argument has very general consequences on the form of @xmath2 , that do not depend on the particular microscopic model .",
    "to this purpose , let us denote an electronic configuration by the positions @xmath12 of the particles .",
    "for all the operators @xmath13 that depend only on such positions , e.g. , the structure factor itself , the quantum average @xmath14 can be written in terms of the _ classical _ distribution @xmath15 , as @xmath16 since @xmath17 is a positive quantity , we can define an appropriate correspondence between the wf and an effective potential @xmath18 : latexmath:[\\[\\label{classical }    that the potential @xmath18 is extensive , namely of order @xmath3 for typical configurations . in the limit of strong coulomb interactions ,",
    "there are small charge fluctuations and , therefore , we can safely assume that only the two - body term is relevant and all multi - particle interactions are negligible .",
    "this leads to the quadratic potential @xmath20 being @xmath21 the fourier transform of the local density of the configuration @xmath22 . to obtain the expected behavior @xmath23",
    "the effective potential must diverge as @xmath24 here @xmath25 can be considered as the effective temperature of classical charges interacting through a potential @xmath26 . within this choice of @xmath27 ,",
    "@xmath11 is generally valid and can be understood by considering @xmath7 as a complex continuous variable , so that the classical average of @xmath28 turns into a standard gaussian integral , yielding @xmath29 it should be noted that the fully - projected wave function with no charge fluctuations , and therefore @xmath30 for @xmath31 , is recovered when @xmath32 .",
    "let us now consider a general one - band fermionic system in 2d , in which every site of a square lattice can be either empty , singly occupied , being the electron either with spin up or down , or doubly occupied . a true mott insulator , that does not break any lattice symmetry , can not be represented by a simple wf containing a single determinant , and , at this stage , it is useful to define a state that is simple enough and yet is compatible with the predicted form of @xmath27 in the insulating phase . a straightforward way to modify the effective potential determined by an uncorrelated determinant @xmath33 is obtained by taking into account an appropriate jastrow factor @xmath34 : latexmath:[\\[\\label{wf }    @xmath33 is an electronic determinant that will be specified in the following and @xmath34 is a jastrow term that depends upon the electronic density : @xmath36,\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the jastrow potential , whose small-@xmath5 behavior is given by : @xmath38 } \\sim   \\frac { \\pi \\beta}{q^2},\\ ] ] @xmath39 fixing its strength .    at",
