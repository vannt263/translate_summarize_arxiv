    ", the gas temperature can be shock - heated to @xmath2 k at the virial radius ( @xmath3 kpc ; e.g. , birnboim & dekel 2003 ; fukugita & peebles 2006 ) , and the total mass contained in the large scale halo can be comparable with or even greater than the total baryonic mass of stars and the interstellar medium in the galactic disk ( e.g. , sommer - larsen 2006 ) . clearly , an observational measurement of such an extended halo will provide an important test of galaxy formation theories .",
    "searching for x - ray emission from large scale halos around nearby disk galaxies has proven unsuccessful .",
    "extraplanar x - ray emissions have indeed been routinely detected around a number of nearby spirals , but only on scales of several kpc ( except for the star burst galaxies ) , and most likely as the result from on - going stellar feedback in galactic disks ( e.g. , tllmann et al .",
    "2006 ; li et al .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness of a galactic halo must be very weak at large scales , at least partly because of the density square dependence of the emission and the possible low metallicity of the gas .",
    "so far , the only claimed detection of an apparent x - ray - emitting halo on a scale of @xmath4 kpc is around the quiescent edge - on disk galaxy ngc  5746 ( pedersen et al .",
    "the large - scale hot gaseous halo around the milky way is indirectly evidenced by the presence of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , in particular , the detection of their associated  line absorption ( e.g. , spitzer 1956 ; sembach et al .",
    "because the -bearing gas is preferentially populated at intermediate temperatures of @xmath5 k where thermally unstable cooling occurs , it is believed to be produced at the interfaces between the cold / warm and the hot media . without knowing the temperature distribution and the metallicity of the hot gas",
    ", however , it is very hard to reliably estimate its total mass .    the best way to directly measure the hot medium is through its x - ray absorption line features .",
    "indeed , , , and/or  absorption lines consistent with zero velocity shifts ( @xmath6 ) have been detected unambiguously toward several bright extragalactic sources ( e.g. , lmc  x3 , mrk  421 , and pks  2155 - 304 ; nicastro et al .",
    "2002 ; fang et al .  2003 ; wang et al .  2005 ;",
    "yao & wang 2007a , yw07a hereafter ) .",
    "but these sight - lines pass through the galactic disk , the extended galactic halo , and ( for those agns ) the possible warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) in the local group .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the bulk of these absorptions can _ not _ be produced in the whim @xcite .",
    "indeed , these highly ionized absorption lines have also been detected in spectra of many galactic sources ( e.g. , yao & wang 2005 ; juett et al .",
    "2006 ) , clearly indicating the existence of the hot gas in the galactic disk .",
    "all existing x - ray absorption and emission data are consistent with the hot gas located in the galactic disk with a vertical exponential scale height of @xmath7 kpc ( yao & wang 2005 , 2007a ) , comparable to those inferred from the angular distributions of column densities of the -bearing gas and pulsar dispersion measures ( savage et al .",
    "2003 ; berkhuijsen et al .",
    "2006 ) . clearly , the constraint on the location of the hot gas depends on the modeling .",
    "for instance , @xcite found that the absorbing gas toward agns are also consistent with a uniformly spherical distribution within a radius of 20 kpc .",
    "the questions here are , whether the extended galactic halo ( defined as the hot gas in the region of @xmath810 kpc beyond the galactic plane but within the galactic virial radius ) exists , and how much does it contribute to the observed highly ionized x - ray absorptions ?    in this letter , we present a differential study searching for such a large - scale hot gaseous halo around our galaxy by comparing observations between sight - lines of 4u  1957 + 11 and mrk  421 , and between those of lmc  x3 and mrk  421 . , , and/or  absorption lines at @xmath6 have been detected in spectra of all three sources observed with _",
    "chandra _ and/or _ xmm - newton x - ray observatories_. these comparisons enable us to probe the galactic halo by examining its contribution to the observed absorption lines , and then to estimate its total mass and/or its metallicity .    throughout the letter , we adopt the solar abundances from @xcite , quote statistical errors ( or upper limits ) for single floating parameters at 90% ( 95% ) confidence levels , and assume that the hot gas in both the galactic disk and halo is in the collisional ionization equilibrium state and is approximately isothermal .",
    "we further assume that the disk gas is distributed following an exponential decay law with a vertical scale height of 2 kpc ( e.g. , savage , et al .",

    "for the _ xmm - newton _ observation , we used the software package _ sas _ ( version 6.50 ) to remove those events contaminated with background flares ( by screening out the time intervals with an event count rate @xmath11 counts / s on the ccd9 ) , and then extracted spectra and calculated rsps from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) events by running the thread _",

    "we derive the first order spectrum with minimal higher ( @xmath15 ) order confusion via the following steps .",
    "we first fit the broadband ( 1.5 - 35  ) order - overlapped spectrum with the order combined rsp , and then multiply the spectral counts channel by channel with the ratio between the model predicated counts based on the first order rsp and that based on the order - combined rsp .",

    "in fact , the   k@xmath0 line has also been detected in the spectrum @xcite . however , we find that , due to an instrumental feature near the line , measuring the amount of the  absorption is severely affected by how the continuum is placed .",
    "to avoid such an uncertainty , in our analysis we only use the spectral range of 1822.5  , covering the oxygen lines as mentioned above .",

    "since all these line are unresolved , we fix the line width @xmath22 to 100 km  s@xmath23 ( please refer to @xmath24 in table  [ tab : results ] ) during these measurements and we use either the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ spectrum , whichever has higher counting statistics near the line ( fig .",

    "a comparison of the line absorption between 4u  1957 + 11 and mrk  421 sight - lines provides an effective probe of the large scale galactic hot gaseous halo .",

    "in reality , the temperature of both the disk and the halo gas could be a function of the vertical off - plane distance , the radial off - galactic center distance , or a combination of both ( e.g. , toft et al .",
    "2002 ; yw07 ) .",
    "this simplified description aims to provide a direct comparison of the amount of absorption between the two sight - lines .",
    "as demonstrated in table  [ tab : results ] and figure  [ fig : mrk ] , the absorption towards 4u  1957 + 11 can account for the bulk of the absorption towards mrk  421 . to quantify the absorption contribution from the putative galactic halo gas , we jointly analyze the absorption lines in these two directions , `` subtract '' the absorption spectrum toward 4u  1957 + 11 direction from that toward mrk  421 direction , and attribute the residual absorption to the halo gas .",
    "we find that the halo gas is consistent with _ no _ contribution to the observed line absorptions .",

    "the halo gas and the disk gas may have different @xmath27 ; for the halo gas over a broad temperature range of @xmath44 k , we find @xmath45 .    following the same procedure as above",
    ", we characterize the line absorptions toward lmc  x3 ( table  [ tab : results ] ; see also wang et al .",
    "2005 ) , and then search for the absorption feature of the halo gas beyond lmc  x3 by comparing it with mrk  421 .",
    "again , we find that the line absorptions toward lmc  x3 can account for all the absorptions observed toward the mrk  421 sight - line ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mrk ] ) , and obtain the upper limits of the column density of the halo by jointly analyzing the sight - lines of lmc  x3 and mrk  421 ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "in this study , we have assumed that the absorption lines observed in the spectra of 4u  1957 + 11 are produced in the ism . however",
    ", the photo - ionized in- or out - flow material intrinsic to 4u  1957 + 11 could contaminate these lines . from the best fit to the _ chandra _ spectrum in the range of 223  , we estimate the source luminosity over 0.510 kev as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the source distance in units of 10 kpc .",
    "a curve of growth analysis with a dispersion velocity ( @xmath24 ) of 0 km  s@xmath23 gives a firm upper limit of the  column density to be @xmath48 ( assuming the solar abundance of ne ) .",
    "this is equivalent to a hydrogen column density @xmath49 , assuming an ionization fraction of 0.5 for . for the absorber ,",
    "the ionization parameter @xmath50 must satisfy @xmath51 , since the  k@xmath0 absorption line has not been detected  @xcite . further assuming a radial gas density distribution @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the location where wind launches and @xmath54",
    ", we obtain @xmath55 , which is much larger than the star separation ( @xmath56 ) of the system ( estimated from its orbital period 9.33 hours and taking an upper limit of the x - ray compact object @xmath57 ) .",
    "these estimates make the in - flow scenario very unlikely . on the other hand ,",
    "if the absorber is out - flow material , the lines are expected to be blue - shifted at velocities larger than the escape velocity of the system ( e.g. , gro j165540 ; miller et al .",
    "2006 ) , which is 260 @xmath58 for 4u  1957 + 11 ( taking @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "in contrast , the detected  k@xmath0 velocity is @xmath61 .",
    "the above arguments suggest that the absorption lines are more likely produced in the ism ( see also juett et al .",
    "2006 ) , although the intrinsic scenario can not be completely ruled out .",
    "we have compared the highly ionized line absorptions of , , and  observed in the spectra of 4u  1957 + 11 and mrk  421 , and in the spectra of lmc  x3 and mrk  421 to search for the large scale galactic halo .",
    "we found that there is no significant x - ray absorption due to hot gas beyond either 4u  1957 + 11 or lmc  x3 .",
    "these results are consistent with our previous conclusion that bulk of the absorptions observed toward the mrk  421 sight - line are due to the hot gas around the galactic disk with a scale height of @xmath62 kpc based on a joint analysis of the absorption and emission data ( yw07 ) .",
    "note that the upper limits obtained toward lmc  x3 are slightly lower than those toward 4u  1957 + 11 ( table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "some of the difference are due to the partial sampling of the galactic disk by the latter sight - line , and the better spectral quality of lmc  x3 also matters .",
    "large scale hot gaseous halos are commonly expected in modern disk formation models for massive spirals ( e.g. white & frenk 1991 ) . for the milky way in particular",
    ", the hot gaseous halo can extend up to @xmath63  kpc and the total mass contained is expected to be @xmath64 , which is currently missing in the baryon mass inventory in the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath65cdm ) cosmology @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite assumed that the fragmentated warm clouds could be formed out of the hot gas halo and proposed a multiphase cooling scenario for the galaxy formation .",
    "this model alleviates the so - called `` over - cooling '' problem faced by the standard cooling model ( e.g. , klypin et al .",
    "they then obtained a density profile for the residual hot halo gas as a function of radius ( eq .",
    "21 and fig . 4 in maller & bullock 2004 ) .",
    "normalizing their density profile by requiring the total column density integrated from 10 to 250 kpc to be @xmath66 ( tabel  [ tab : results ] ) , we obtain the total mass contained in the halo as @xmath67 . clearly , to match this upper limit with the total missing baryon mass in the mw , @xmath43 should be @xmath68 of the solar value .",
    "more recently , @xcite assumed that gaseous halos of galaxies are in a hydrostatic equilibrium state and that the gas density and the total mass density profiles are power laws , and then derived a hot halo gas density profile for the mw - like galaxy ( fig .  2 in hansen & sommer - larsen 2006 ) .",
    "again , normalizing their profile we obtain the total hot gas mass as @xmath69 m@xmath70 , requiring @xmath43 to be @xmath71 of the solar value .    low metallicity of the hot halo gas is not surprising ; the halo gas is believed to be primarily accreted from the intergalactic medium that is expected to be metal poor .",
    "this would also suggest that the star formation and the associated stellar feedback via type ii supernovae ( sneii ) that occurred in the galactic disk and bulge are not important in regulating the metal content of the halo .",
    "hot gas resulting from sneii , if leaking into the halo ( e.g. , mac low & ferrara 1999 ) , may cool quickly enough ( via adiabatic expansion and atomic line radiation ) to form metal - rich cold clouds in the local environment before homogenizing with the halo gas ( wang 2007 ) . as these clouds",
    "return back to the disk plane as galactic fountains , their interaction with the embedding hot gas could be another mechanism of warm cloud formation as required in multiphase cooling scenarios @xcite .",
    "the interfaces between these two media may harbor the bulk of hvcs as observed via   absorptions at large distance ( e.g. , sembach et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this letter",
    ", we derive the mass and metallicity limits on the putative galactic halo by comparing the observed absorption lines among the sight - lines of 4u  1957 + 11 , lmc  x3 , and mrk  421 . however , the amount of absorptions observed along different agn sight - lines could vary substantially ( e.g. , bregman & lloyd - davies 2007 ) , which may be due to additional absorption components ( e.g. , 3c  273 ; yao & wang 2007b ) and/or different absorbing gas properties .",
    "more comparisons among other sight - lines are therefore needed to confirm the presented results .",
