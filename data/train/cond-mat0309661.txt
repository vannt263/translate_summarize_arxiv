    "time - dependent or radiation induced phenomena in various mesoscopic electron systems has attracted considerable interest over the past few years  @xcite . these high - frequency modulated nanostructures , formed in a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) by applying appropriate confinement , are important both in connection with device application and can function as convenient samples to probe the properties of electron systems in reduced dimensions .",
    "it is well discovered , in both theory  @xcite and experiment  @xcite , that a quantum ring in a perpendicular magnetic field or an aharonov - bohm magnetic flux can carry an equilibrium current , the persistent current .",
    "this current is periodic in the magnetic flux enclosed by the ring with a period of the elementary flux quantum @xmath3 .",
    "we present here a method to change the persistent current pattern in quantum rings non - adiabatically with a strong and short thz pulse . in this paper",
    "we investigate a one - dimensional ring neglecting the coulomb interaction between spinless electrons , since its inclusion in a lsda scheme changes the results quantitatively , but not qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "the results are compared to the results for a finite - width quantum ring  @xcite allowing us to identify different collective modes in the excited state of the quantum rings influencing their persistent currents .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional ring with noninteracting spinless electrons .",
    "the ring is subject to a uniform perpendicular magnetic field @xmath4 . at time @xmath5 the system is in the ground state , the electron gas can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 ^ 2\\\\      & \\\\      & \\displaystyle = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^*r_0 ^ 2}\\left [      \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\theta^2 }      + 2i \\ \\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta }      - \\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\phi_0}\\right)^2\\right ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the radius of the ring , @xmath8 is the magnetic flux enclosed by it and @xmath3 is the unit flux quantum .",
    "the eigenfunctions and the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian are given by @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we use the density matrix to specify the state of the system as the concepts of a single electron energy spectrum and occupation number are ill - defined when the system is subject to a strong external time - dependent perturbation .",
    "the ground - state density matrix @xmath12 is constructed from the expansion coefficients of electronic states in terms of the basis states of @xmath13 . at time @xmath5 it is still possible to describe the occupation of the states by the fermi distribution and the chemical potential @xmath14 , ensuring the conservation of the number of electrons , @xmath15 at time @xmath5 the ring is radiated by a short thz pulse making the hamiltonian of the system time - dependent , namely @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the heaviside step function , and the parameters are explained below .",
    "here we consider the spatial part of the excitation pulse as a dipole radiation .",
    "the equation of motion for the density operator is given by @xmath19.\\ ] ] the structure of this equation is inconvenient for numerical evaluation so we resort instead to the time - evolution operator @xmath20 , defined by @xmath21 , leading to a simpler equation of motion @xmath22 we then discretize the time variable and utilize the crank - nicholson algorithm for the time integration  @xcite with the initial condition , @xmath23 .",
    "this is performed in a truncated basis of the hamiltonian @xmath13 , @xmath24 .",
    "the time - dependent orbital magnetization @xmath25 is used to quantify the currents induced by @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization operator @xmath27 together with the definition for the current , @xmath28 $ ] , give in terms of the density matrix in the basis of @xmath13 the dynamic magnetization @xmath29 which , on inserting for the matrix elements of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , for the 1d quantum ring , can be written @xmath32 the equations for the time - evolution operator are integrated for a time interval of @xmath33 ps or longer using an increment of @xmath34 ps and @xmath25 is evaluated at each step . to model the ring with a number of electrons , @xmath35 , in a gaas sample we select a radius of @xmath36 nm and @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the free electron mass . for the radiation pulse of just over @xmath39 ps , we select @xmath40 ps@xmath41 and the strength @xmath42 ev .",
    "the envelope frequency corresponds to @xmath43 mev and the base frequency is @xmath44 mev .",
    "we use a basis set with @xmath45 and the temperature is @xmath46 k.",
    "the time evolution of the electron density in the ring is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a ring with eight electrons in a magnetic field of @xmath47 t. we see clearly how the perturbation induces angular oscillations that continue after the pulse has vanished .",
    "the shape of the excitation pulse is shown in fig.[fig2 ] in the time domain , and it should be remembered that the spatial part of the pulse does not break the left / right symmetry .    for the one - dimensional ring ,",
    "the magnetization reaches a steady state value almost immediately after the perturbation has been turned off , as shown in fig .",
    "although there remain oscillations in the electron density the magnetization remains constant .",
    "this is different with the case of the finite - width ring @xcite , in which the radial plasma oscillations are excited by the perturbation and the lorentz force couples them with density oscillations in the angular direction . as a consequence the magnetization for the ring with finite width oscillates after the excitation has been turned off , but its average value",
    ", the d.c.component is different from the initial value at @xmath5 .    as for the finite - width ring the magnetization of the one - dimensional ring",
    "after the perturbation has vanished is different from the magnetization of the ground state for a nonzero magnetic field , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for a single electron ring . for low values of the magnetic field , the magnetization ( and thus the current ) increases proportional to the perturbation strength .",
    "when @xmath48 t the magnetization changes sign , implying that the direction of the current has changed , and for all magnetic fields shown the current after excitation is in anti - phase with the equilibrium persistent current .    at @xmath49 t",
    "( equivalent to @xmath50 ) the magnetization goes to zero even after the system has been excited .",
    "the reason for this becomes clear when looking at the energy spectrum of the ring , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . at integer and half - integer values of the magnetic flux",
    "the slope of all energy levels is zero . as the current is proportional to the slope",
    ", no states can carry a current and thus it has no effect to excite the ring to a higher energy state . at these values of @xmath51 the magnetic field is not able to break the left / right symmetry of the system .",
    "the spectrum of the finite - width ring is only quasi periodic in the magnetic flux and thus the pulse is able to excite the system to a higher energy state which has a finite magnetization at these values of @xmath51 .",
    "the current generated depends strongly on the number of electrons on the ring . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the case of eight electrons , the magnetization decreases as a result of the perturbation and it does not manage to alter the direction of the current .    by inspecting the diagonal elements of the density matrix",
    "it becomes clear that the persistent current is changed through a modified occupation of the single - electron states , especially around the chemical potential for the moderate excitation we use here .",
    "after the perturbation has been turned off the combination of angular momentum states are different from that of the ground state .",
    "the state of the system is changed nonadiabatically by the excitation pulse .",
    "the persistent current of the system is changed through a modified occupation of the single - electron states .",
    "after excitation it is characteristic for a radiation induced excited state with collective oscillations and can thus be quite different from the equilibrium current .",
    "the main difference between the 1d and the 2d quantum rings comes from the different collective oscillation modes supported by the systems . in the case of a ring with a finite width",
    "the change in the persistent current is caused by radial plasma oscillations coupled to the collective angular oscillations .",
    "for both systems the breaking of the left / right symmetry that leads to a different persistent current is not caused by the excitation pulse , but by the external magnetic field .",
