    "a universal read - write quantum memory , viewed as a black box , is a memory in which a quantum state of light can be stored and later retrieved on demand .",

    "note that for afc memories this formula holds for backward read - out , while for forward read - out the efficiency is @xmath20 .",
    "for the popular memory scheme based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , the efficiency has also been calculated as a function of optical depth @xcite .",

    "the dd sequence can be represented by a unitary transformation @xmath24 , where the index indicates that the unitaries are different for every spin , such that the final state after the dd sequence is @xmath25 .",
    "errors in the dd sequence transform the initial state such that the final state can not be read - out optically with the same efficiency .",
    "we denote the efficiency of the dd sequence as @xmath26 , such that the overall memory efficiency including the dd sequence is @xmath27 .",
    "imperfections can also induce extra population in the @xmath9 state , which we denote by the fractional population term @xmath28 . if we assume that this population is completely transferred to the excited state by the optical read - out field it will cause spontaneous emission in the output mode . following the calculations in ref .",

    "the question then arises how to calculate @xmath26 and @xmath28 for a given unitary @xmath34 describing a particular dd sequence .",
    "if we assume that , instead of storing a single photon fock state @xmath35 , we store a coherent state @xmath36 , with @xmath37 , then the resulting state is the spin - coherent state @xmath38 .",
    "if we also assume , for simplicity , that the transfer probability to the spin state is without loss , then @xmath39 can be written as    latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq:7 }     in this case @xmath26 is proportional to the averaged coherence @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the averaged state after the evolution @xmath34 and @xmath43 are the pauli matrices .",
    "this follows from a semiclassical approach , where the signal strength is proportional to the expectation value of the dipole moment operator .    storing a single photon @xmath35 results in an entangled state @xmath11",
    "this state gives rise to difficulties in terms of the proper choice for @xmath26 @xcite and complexity of the calculations .",

    ", we first note that the phase information of an arbitrary ( entangled ) state may not be given by the off - diagonal elements of the reduced one - particle state like for spin - coherent states .",
    "in contrast , the two - body correlation function is the relevant parameter for the inter - atomic phase coherence for arbitrary states .",
    "hence , the reduced two - body states of @xmath44 ( or of any general state ) determine @xmath26 .",
    "however , it is straightforward to show that the reduced two - body states of @xmath44 and @xmath45 averaged over @xmath46 differ only by a @xmath47 correction . with additional arguments",

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) differ from @xmath48 ( see appendix ) .",
    "hence , we can approximate the two - body correlations very well by using spin - coherent states ( [ eq:7 ] ) and integrate over @xmath46 .",

    "hence , we will only consider the cp sequence in the following . the simplest sequence which partially compensates amplitude errors for any initial state is the xy4 sequence @xcite .",

    "since any two - level unitary operation is isomorphic to a rotation in a three - dimensional real space , it can be written in the form @xmath73 up to a global phase , where @xmath74 is the unit vector that points in direction of the rotation axis and @xmath75 is the angle that determines how much @xmath76 rotates . in our case ,",

    "in addition , the angle @xmath75 for xy4 is quadratically suppressed compared to cp and cpmg .",

    "however , dd sequences that are more complex than cp profit from smaller @xmath5 . as already stated in ref .",

    "consequently , only in the third regime @xmath127 can one ensure that @xmath125 is approximately constant over the time scale of one sequence block .",

    "this would , however , also double the number of hyperfine states in both the ground and electronic levels , which possibly could reduce the memory absorption probability ( i.e. efficiency ) due to difficulties in spin polarizing all ions into a single hyperfine state @xmath8 .",
    "cavity - enhancement of the absorption probability can provide one possible solution to this problem @xcite . but applying a b field would also have the benefit of increasing the spin bath correlation time @xmath156 , which can reach several seconds for particular field directions as shown by zhong _",

    ". then the timescale on which a high snr could be achieved would be 3 orders of magnitude longer than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snrhom ] , that is 10 minutes or more .",
    "to conclude , we proposed a functional expression for the snr of spin - ensemble based quantum memories .",
    "we subsequently applied the snr to various known dd sequences and evaluated their performance in the presence of amplitude errors and homogeneous broadening .",
    "our main findings are the following .    neglecting homogeneous broadening , we parametrized every sequence by a rotation axis @xmath74 and a rotation angle @xmath75 .",
    "we identified @xmath75 as the key parameter of the sequence : the inverse @xmath157 is directly connected to @xmath4 , because a reasonable snr can only be warranted if @xmath158 .",
    "we confirm that more complex sequences generally have a smaller @xmath75 .",
    "hence , in the regime where the amplitude error dominates , it clearly makes sense to use an elaborate phase relation between the @xmath3 pulses to increase @xmath4 .    in the presence of homogeneous broadening",
    ", we found evidence that the optimal pulse delay @xmath5 is in the order of @xmath159 , where @xmath0 is the length of one sequence block . on first sight , it might be surprising that one profits from reducing @xmath5 from @xmath160 to @xmath161 , since more pulses apparently induce more population noise . however ,",
    "if one has a correlation time that is in the order of the entire sequence block , one can profit from elaborate phase relations between the @xmath3 pulses , which in turn increases the stability of the storage process against amplitude errors .",

    "we additionally assume that the subsequent time evolution can be written as a product of unitary operations @xmath164 , where the index indicates that the unitaries are different for every spin . for the snr",

    "the signal in the photonic mode is determined by the transfer efficiency and @xmath166 . to judge on @xmath166",
    ", we consider the hamiltonian for the light - matter interaction , which is given by @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "then , @xmath170 measures the expected photonic signal after re - emission , assuming unit transfer efficiency .",
    "the noise is similar to evaluate .",
    "the spin excitations induced by imperfections during the dd lead to emission of additional photons .",
    "since the transfer of these excitations to the photonic mode is uncorrelated , the cross terms in @xmath171 average to zero and one is left with @xmath172 .    for a simpler treatment of the problem",

    "note that @xmath28 and @xmath26 are one- and two - body correlation functions , respectively .",
    "hence , it is sufficient to consider one- and two - body reduced density operators @xmath174 and @xmath175 . assuming that we have a rather homogeneous distribution of the excitation ( i.e. , @xmath176 for all @xmath177 ) , it is straightforward to show that the product state @xmath178 with @xmath179 has approximately the same one- and two - body reduced density operators , after integrating over @xmath46 .",
    "more precisely , one finds for all @xmath180 that @xmath181 and @xmath182 with a correction @xmath183 .",
    "we can go one step further and replace @xmath184 by a spin - coherent state . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case @xmath185 in the following .",
    "since we assume a perfect excitation transfer for the absorption , the phases of @xmath13 necessarily have to match with those of @xmath186 , that is , @xmath187 .",
    "this implies that we can perform a local basis rotation @xmath188 in the @xmath70-@xmath71 plane and find that @xmath189 , where @xmath190 and @xmath191 there is an apparent complication by having the local unitary @xmath34 .",

    "one easily finds that @xmath209 .",
    "simple manipulations then lead to @xmath210 with @xmath211 .",
    "notice that the above discussion is simpler for @xmath28 , since one can always choose the local basis rotation @xmath188 such that it does not have any influence on the population .",
