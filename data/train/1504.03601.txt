    "we will discuss problems with very elementary formulations that concern the most popular notions in mathematics : metric spaces , convex geometry , combinatorics of polytopes and kantorovich s optimal transportation . according to arnold s classification , there are two ways to introduce a new subject : the first way ( he called it the `` russian tradition '' ) is to start with `` the simplest non - trivial partial case '' .",
    " i will use this approach . the second and the opposite tradition , which i also like very much ( he called it `` bourbaki s tradition '' )",
    "is to start with an `` extremely general case that is impossible to further generalize '' .",
    "so my metric spaces will be finite , polytopes will be finite - dimensional etc .",
    "but all the notions and problems have infinite , infinite - dimensional , and continuous analogs",
    ".    * general problem .",
    "* study and classify finite metric spaces according to combinatorial properties of their fundamental polytopes , associated with metric spaces in a canonical fashion . a more precise formulation follows .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "i explain the terminology that is used in the title and in the problem .",
    "\\1 . let @xmath0 , @xmath1 , be a finite metric space",
    ". we will write @xmath2 for the vector space of all real - valued functions on @xmath3 . the value of a function @xmath4 at a point @xmath5 will be denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the space @xmath2 can be naturally identified with the space of all formal linear combinations of elements of @xmath3 . under this identification ,",
    "any element @xmath5 identifies with the delta - function equal to 1 at @xmath7 and to 0 at all other points of @xmath3 .",
    "define the real vector space @xmath8 as a subspace of @xmath2 consisting of all @xmath4 with @xmath9 .",
    "let us define the map @xmath10 taking an element @xmath7 to the function @xmath11 such that @xmath12 for all @xmath13 .",
    "then we must have @xmath14 .",
    "the convex hull @xmath15 $ ] of the image of this map is a @xmath16-dimensional simplex denoted by @xmath17 ( this simplex is obtained from the standard coordinate simplex in @xmath2 by the projection mapping @xmath5 to @xmath18 ) .",
    "the metric @xmath19 can be considered now as a metric on the vertices of the simplex @xmath20 , we use the same symbol @xmath19 to denote this metric . for every pair of distinct points",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath21 , consider the vectors @xmath22 defined by the formula : @xmath23 this vectors will play a major role in what follows .    * the fundamental polytope of a metric space * @xmath0 is the convex polytope @xmath24 obtained as the convex hull of all vectors @xmath25 , where @xmath26 run through all pairs of distinct points of @xmath3 .",
    "the combinatorial type of @xmath24 , i.e. , the isomorphism class of the corresponding poset of faces , is called the _ combinatorial structure _ of the finite metric space @xmath0 . two finite metric spaces with the same combinatorial structures called _ similar metric spaces_.    it is easy to see that the fundamental polytope @xmath24 is centrally symmetric ( i.e. , it coincides with its reflection in the origin ) .",
    "if @xmath27 for any pair of distinct elements @xmath7 , @xmath21 , then the fundamental polytope is the minkowski sum of two simplices @xmath20 and @xmath28 .    in general , we consider the fixed set of rays @xmath29 , which is independent of the metric , and choose one point in each ray with @xmath30 ( this choice now depends on the metric ) .",
    "the fundamental polytope is the convex hull of all thus obtained points .",
    "a simple fact @xcite that characterizes the fundamental polytopes of finite metric spaces , is the following : given a symmetric function @xmath31 , consider the polytope @xmath32 then this function @xmath19 is a metric on @xmath3 if and only if no point @xmath25 belongs to the interior of convex hull of the other points .",
    "the polytope @xmath24 is convex and central symmetric ; therefore , it defines the minkowski - banach norm @xmath33 in the real vector space @xmath8 , whose unit ball is by definition the polytope @xmath24 . in the finite - dimensional case ,",
    "this norm is the so called _ kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein norm_. if @xmath27 whenever @xmath34 , then the corresponding fundamental polytope is the so called _ root polytope _ , and the corresponding kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein norm is the restriction to @xmath8 of the @xmath35-norm in the space @xmath2 .",
    "thus we reduce the analysis of metric space to the convex geometry of fundamental polytope .",
    "since the space @xmath3 is isometrically embedded into @xmath8 ( points of @xmath3 correspond to the vertices of the simplex @xmath20 , endowed with metric @xmath19 ( see above )    we can restore metric on @xmath3 using fundamental polytope .",
    "recall that the combinatorial type of a convex polytope is the isomorphism class of the partial ordered set form by the faces of the polytope , ordered by inclusion ; the @xmath36-vector of a convex polytope is the finite tuple @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the number of vertices , @xmath39 is the number of edges , etc . , @xmath40 is number of facets ( i.e. , faces of codimension 1 ) and , finally , @xmath41 .",
    "our definition is functorial in the sense that each isometry of one metric space to another vector space produces an affine isomorphism of the corresponding fundamental polytopes .",
    "we may say that the notion of the combinatorial type of metric spaces defines a natural stratification of the cone @xmath42 of all distance matrices ( i.e. , real symmetric @xmath43 matrices , whose entries are the values of a distance function defined on some finite metric space of cardinality @xmath44 ) .",
    "below we suggest to study this important stratification , more precisely , to solve the following problems .",
    "express the combinatorial structure of @xmath0 in terms of the metric @xmath19 , i.e. , find the @xmath36-vector of the corresponding fundamental polytope in terms of the metric @xmath19 itself  using linear inequalities on the values of metric etc .",
    "estimate the number of combinatorial structures for any given @xmath44 and study its asymptotic behavior as @xmath44 tends to infinity .",
    "the most interesting thing is to estimate the number of `` open '' ( generic ) types .",
    "provide sufficient conditions on two metric spaces to be similar .",
    "it is well known that most finite metric spaces can not be isometrically imbedded into a euclidean or a hilbert space ( we say that these metrics do not have euclidean type ) .",
    "the following question appears :    \\4 .",
    "describe the combinatorial types of metric spaces of euclidean type .",
    "do we obtain all combinatorial types ?",
    "\\5 . does the stratification of the space of distance matrices into the combinatorial types is _ universal _",
    "? or , on the contrary , there are some restrictions on the topological types of the open components?[multiblock footnote omitted ]",
    "consider a very degenerate metric space with @xmath44 points : @xmath45 , the set of all integers from 1 to @xmath44 with mutual distances between all pairs of distinct points equal to @xmath46 : @xmath47 .    in this case",
    ", the simplex @xmath20 is a regular euclidean simplex .",
    "we can view it as @xmath16-simplex in a cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra @xmath48 . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the simplex is spanned by all positive simple roots @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and one maximal root @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath45 and @xmath47 , @xmath54 , @xmath51 , @xmath44 .",
    "identify the vector space @xmath8 with a cartan subalgebra of the lie algebra @xmath48 .",
    "then the fundamental polytope @xmath55 is the convex hull of all roots . the norm @xmath56 associated with the fundamental polytope coincides with the restriction of the @xmath35-norm on @xmath2 @xmath57 to the hyperplane @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the polytope @xmath24 in this case is the intersection of an @xmath44-dimensional octahedron with the hyperplane @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding norm @xmath59 on the lie algebra of skew - hermitian matrices with zero trace is the `` nuclear norm '' , for which the norm of a matrix is the sum of the moduli of all its eigenvalues .",
    "it is natural to call @xmath24 the `` root polytope '' .",
    "an easy exercise is to find the @xmath36-vector in this case .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 and @xmath61 , then the fundamental polygon is a regular hexagon , and the norm is the hexagonal norm . for @xmath62 , see the figure : the @xmath36-vector is equal to @xmath63 , the facets are 8 regular triangles and 6 squares . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the group of symmetries of the fundamental polytope is the dihedral group @xmath64 . for @xmath62 , see the figure .",
    "note that the group of symmetries of the root polytope includes the weyl group ( which is isomorphic to the symmetric group ) .",
    "root polytopes were mentioned for other reason in @xcite .",
    "why is the definition of the fundamental polytope @xmath24 associated with a finite metric space @xmath0 natural ? the justification is as follows .",
    "we want to define a natural metric @xmath65 on @xmath8 that extends the metric @xmath19 on @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is identified with the set of vertices of the simplex @xmath20 so that the distance between two points @xmath7 and @xmath66 in @xmath3 coincides with the distance between the corresponding vertices @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the simplex @xmath20 . in another words ,",
    "we want to define a norm @xmath59 in @xmath8 with the property @xmath69 .",
    "there are many such extensions but there is a maximal one :    ( @xcite ) the norm @xmath33 , called the kantorovich - rubinstein norm , is the unique maximal extension of @xmath19 : all other norms possessing this extension property are less that this one because the fundamental polytope is contained in the unit balls of all such norms .",
    "the direct description of an extension of the metric @xmath19 to the whole simplex @xmath20 is a classical definition by kantorovich of his transportation metric .",
    "this definition is well known in the mathematical economics and in linear programming but there were no publications ( before @xcite , see comments below ) , in which characteristic properties of fundamental polytopes are discussed and serious combinatorial investigations are conducted .",
    "recall , for the sake of completeness , the classical definition of the _ kantorovich transportation metric _ , which is equivalent to our definition above .",
    "consider the positive part @xmath70 and the negative part @xmath71 of the vector @xmath72 .",
    "the vector @xmath70 is defined as the componentwise maximum of @xmath72 and the zero vector , and the vector @xmath71 is defined as the componentwise minimum . evidently , we have @xmath73 .",
    "thus we have two nonnegative vectors @xmath74 and @xmath75 with equal sums of coordinates .    then classical definition is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the convex set of all matrices @xmath78 with the following properties : @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the coordinate of the vector @xmath81 corresponding to the point @xmath5 , and similarly for @xmath82 .",
    "the last question is also of arnold s style ( see e.g. @xcite ) : in our definition of the kantorovich metric , we used only the root system @xmath48 .",
    "my question is : what are the analogs of this definition ( and maybe even of the transportation problem ! ) for other series of lie algebras and other weyl groups .",
