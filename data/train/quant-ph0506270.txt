    "to understand which sets of quantum control operations are sufficient for quantum computing is still an important issue of research .",
    "whereas the standard model of the quantum computer is based on one- and two - qubit unitaries there is meanwhile a large number of alternative proposals , e.g. computing by measurements only @xcite or adiabatic computing @xcite .",
    "the latter model encodes a computational problem into an interaction such that the ground state of the hamiltonian indicates the solution . in order to understand the power of adiabatic computing it is particularly interesting to know to what extent",
    "the transition into the ground state of simple interactions can already be a non - trivial computation process .",
    "since it has been shown that every problem in the complexity class qma can be encoded in a nearest - neighbor interaction of qubits located on a 2d lattice @xcite it is clear that , indeed , relatively simple hamiltonians are sufficient for adiabatic computing .",
    "this highlights the computational power of simple hamiltonians from one point of view .",
    "another aspect of the `` computational power of hamiltonians '' has been studied in models where the natural time evolution is interspersed by external control operations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the intention of the present paper is to understand to what extent models with simple interactions can already be autonomous devices with full quantum computing power in the sense that quantum computation reduces to the following protocol : ( 1 ) prepare an initial state in the computational basis which contains the data , ( 2 ) wait for a sufficiently long time , and ( 3 ) measure a sufficiently large set of qubits in the computational basis .",
    "in @xcite we have constructed a hamiltonian satisfying these conditions with the additional feature that the readout need not necessarily be performed within a specific time interval ; in our `` ergodic quantum computer '' the result is also present in the time average of the dynamics after some simple post - selection with high success probability . even though this property may be of minor practical relevance , we considered it as a necessary feature of an _ autonomous _",
    "computer since one would otherwise require a clock as an additional device . here",
    "we construct an interaction that is even simpler than the one constructed in @xcite since the latter requires 10-qubit interactions .",
    "the motivation to consider autonomous quantum computers is twofold .",
    "first , it could trigger new ideas how to reduce the set of necessary control operations in current implementation proposals by using the `` natural power '' of the interactions . in addressing this issue",
    ", the ergodic model defines only an extreme case ; realistic perspectives for quantum computing could arise by combining it with more conventional approaches .",
    "second it is an interesting fundamental issue in the thermodynamics of computation how to realize computation in closed physical systems .",
    "benioff , feynman , and margolus have already presented such hamiltonian computers @xcite .",
    "margolus asynchronous hamiltonian cellular automaton ( ca ) has the appealing feature to be lattice - symmetric . in other words , it is driven by a finite - range interaction among qubits located on a 2d lattice such that the total hamiltonian is invariant under discrete translations .",
    "the synchronization of the ca is realized by a kind of spin wave propagating along the lattice and triggering the update of the cells according to some computationally universal update rules which are not specified any further in @xcite .",
    "however , its clock wave has to start in an uncertain _ position _ in order to obtain a well localized _ momentum _",
    "distribution with mainly positive momenta .",
    "a localized wave front would also propagate backwards and would therefore not trigger a correct computation . in @xcite we have chosen the same synchronization scheme but we start with a localized wave front since we allow only for preparations of _ basis _ states .",
    "the fact that the dispersion of the wave front leads to completely undefined computation steps is irrelevant since the _ time average _ of the dynamics encodes the correct result .",
    "the feature of our ergodic model to show the correct computation result also in the time average was hence only a nice byproduct of the fact that we must use a concept which works with a strange kind of clock : the latter starts with a well - defined time but then it counts backwards and forward with completely undefined counting speed .",
    "note that the time average can also be considered as the `` generalized final state '' of our computer since a final output state in the usual sense can not exist for finite dimensional hamiltonian models .    to ask for a simple finite range hamiltonian that is universal for quantum computation is in some sense similar to asking for a simple computationally universal quantum cellular automaton ( for some proposals see @xcite ) with the only difference of considering update rules which change the state only in an `` infinitesimal '' way .",
    "however , local interactions in lattices have typically the property to spread the information into increasingly large regions , whereas it is possible to construct update rules for cellular automata that work by propagating the information forward column by column @xcite .",
    "this apparent difference between discrete and continuous time dynamics can already be explained with the translation operator on @xmath0 qubits : the cyclic shift is a unitary that can be achieved by local update rules @xcite , whereas the hamiltonian obtained from the logarithm of the shift contains interactions between _ distant _ qubits .",
    "hamiltonians with finite interaction length will typically spread the information over the lattice .",
    "therefore , one has to be more modest and demand that the correct result can only be present with high probability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ syn ]",
    "we explain the hardware of our model consisting of a chain of atoms on a 2d square lattice .",
    "we construct a nearest - neighbor interaction which leads via a simple effective hamiltonian to a coupled random walk that will later trigger the implementation of gates acting on the atom spins . in section  [ holo ] we explain how to arrange spin - spin interactions among the atoms such that they implement logical gates based on holonomic quantum computing . in section  [ complete ]",
    "we describe the complete hamiltonian of our computing device . in section  [ sec : diag ] we show that the time evolution of the effective hamiltonian is solvable since it can be transformed into a quasifree evolution of fermions .",
    "based on this solution , we estimate the time required for the computation process . in section  [ impl ]",
    "we briefly sketch some ideas on the realization .",
    "section  [ sec : ca ] describes how to construct the hamiltonian such that it implements a universal quantum cellular automaton .",
    "this is to obtain programmable hardware . in the appendix we present an alternative model for the atom propagation which is caused by an even simpler hamiltonian since the nearest - neighbor interactions in the model presented in the main part involves also _ diagonal neighbors _ in the lattice .",
    "in contrast , the model in the appendix uses only _",
    "nearest _ neighbors in a strict sense . however , the corresponding hamiltonian dynamics will not be solvable .",
    "we will therefore consider an incoherent analogue and show that the corresponding classical random walk would trigger the implementation of gates in the desired way .",
    "for the coherent model , we can only conjecture that an appropriate propagation is achieved .",
    "now we present a model of a 2d lattice with a coupled propagation of a chain of atoms which will later be the synchronization mechanism of the computer . while propagating along the horizontal direction ( see fig .",
    "[ diagonalpositionen ] ) the spin of the atoms ( which represent the logical states ) will be subjected to spatially inhomogeneous interactions that implement the desired gates .",
    "it is important that the chain does not tear since the spin - spin interactions to be described later will only be active between adjacent atoms .",
    "furthermore , it is important for the synchronization that the chain remains connected .",
    "this will become clear in section  [ holo ] .",
    "we will now describe the synchronization hamiltonian in detail and show that it generates a diagonalizable quantum walk .",
    "the lattice and the initial atom configuration are shown in fig .",
    "[ diagonalpositionen ] .",
    "the lattice sites are given by @xmath1 black fields of the modified chess - board in fig .",
    "[ diagonalpositionen ] .",
    "the @xmath2 atoms are only allowed to move forward or backward along the horizontal direction , i.e. , along the rows .",
    "each atom can only hop from a black site to either the next or the previous black site in the row .",
    "furthermore , the atoms can only move such that the chain does not tear , i.e. , atoms in adjacent rows are always diagonal neighbors .",
    "[ possible < ] shows a possible configuration .",
    "now we describe the hamiltonian that allows only collective motions of the atoms respecting these rules .",
    "the grid of black fields is labeled by @xmath3 with @xmath4 .",
    "the sites @xmath5 with @xmath6 indicate the diagonal line leading from the leftmost field to the uppermost one and sites @xmath7 with @xmath8 indicate the diagonal line from the leftmost field to the lower - most one .",
    "we consider the hilbert space of all atom configurations as a subspace of an @xmath9-qubit register of the form @xmath10 where qubit @xmath3 corresponds to lattice site @xmath3 and the basis states @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate that there is no atom or that there is an atom , respectively , at position @xmath3 .",
    "a subspace of @xmath13 is the clock hilbert space @xmath14 spanned by all _ allowed _ configurations .",
    "they correspond to those basis states in @xmath13 for which there is exactly one atom in each row and for which the atom chain is connected .",
    "first we introduce interactions between site @xmath3 and @xmath15 which generates independent hopping of atoms along the rows : @xmath16 to achieve that the atom configuration remains a connected chain we introduce a strong attractive force between diagonal neighbors : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is assumed to be much larger than @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the projection on the states with an atom in position @xmath21 .",
    "the sum runs over all unordered pairs of sites @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the physically irrelevant term @xmath24 is ( for purely technical reasons ) chosen such that the initial configuration has zero energy .",
    "the energy is minimal if all attractive interactions are active .",
    "otherwise , if the chain is not connected , the potential energy is at least @xmath25 .",
    "we define the `` synchronization hamiltonian '' , which leads to the desired coupled motion of atoms , by @xmath26 in order to analyze the dynamics generated by @xmath27 we first argue that it can be replaced with an effective clock hamiltonian @xmath28 having @xmath14 as an invariant subspace .",
    "the initial atom configuration defines a ground state of @xmath29 .",
    "due to @xmath30 the comparably small perturbation @xmath31 can not circumvent the gap to one of the first excited states of @xmath29 .",
    "if @xmath32 denotes the spectral projection of @xmath29 corresponding to the ground state energy @xmath33 we will therefore expect a dynamical evolution according to @xmath34 note that not all states in the image of @xmath32 are allowed clock states since the image of @xmath32 contains also states with more than one atom in a row .",
    "however , these ground states could only be reached from an allowed state if @xmath31 contained hopping terms along columns .",
    "the following lemma ( proven in the appendix ) justifies more formally that we may analyze the dynamics according to @xmath28 instead of @xmath27 :    [ approx ] for @xmath35 and @xmath36 the norm distance between the effective hamiltonian in equation  ( [ effdef ] ) and the restriction @xmath37 of @xmath27 to the eigenspace corresponding to eigenvalues smaller than @xmath25 satisfies @xmath38    if we increase the attractive part of the interaction proportional to @xmath39 if @xmath0 increases the time evolution induced by @xmath28 is a good approximation for the true one . if the intention of this article was to propose a physical implementation scheme this would be a rather bad scaling , leading possibly to hard practical problems .",
    "however , from the computer science point of view , it is essential that the increase of energy is only polynomial in @xmath0 and we will thus obtain an _ efficient _ model of computation",
    ".    we will now give a more explicit form of @xmath28 . to be more precise",
    ", we will describe an operator whose restriction to @xmath14 coincides with @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath40 denote some basis state in @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath41 describes an allowed atom configuration .",
    "then @xmath42 is a superposition of all atom configurations with connected chain that can be reached from @xmath41 by moving one atom forward or backwards in its diagonal row .",
    "in other words , each hopping term @xmath43 is only active if the sites @xmath44 and @xmath45 are occupied .",
    "we have therefore a conditional hopping given by @xmath46 where the symbol @xmath14 at the right indicates the restriction to @xmath14 . using a slightly more intuitive notation , which respects the orientation of fig .",
    "[ diagonalpositionen ] , the summands of @xmath28 can be denoted by    @xmath47    where this @xmath48-local operator acts on @xmath48 black sites enclosing a common white site .",
    "we are interested in the dynamical evolution of the quantum state defined by the initial atom configuration .",
    "since it is a ground state of the dominating hamiltonian @xmath49 the major part of the state vector is contained in that spectral subspace of @xmath27 which corresponds to energy values not greater than @xmath50 . using the bound of lemma  [ approx ] we may then estimate the error in the dynamical evolution caused by replacing the true evolution with the evolution according to @xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath51 be an arbitrary allowed atom configuration .",
    "then we have @xmath52 where @xmath53 as in lemma  [ approx ] .",
    "due to @xmath54 the average energy of @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56 where the last inequality is given by counting the number of terms in eq .",
    "( [ vham ] ) .",
    "let @xmath57 be the spectral projection of @xmath27 corresponding to all eigenvalues less than @xmath25 .",
    "then we have @xmath58 using @xmath59 and @xmath60 we conclude @xmath61 we have @xmath62 where we have used @xmath63 for two self - adjoint matrices @xmath64 .",
    "the statement follows then by replacing the last term in eq .",
    "( [ arrayeq ] ) with the right hand side of ineq .",
    "( [ rem ] ) .",
    "@xmath65    one could use the condition @xmath66 of theorem  [ fehler ] to determine the time scale for which @xmath28 is a good approximation when @xmath25 is given .",
    "we can also assume that the time scale is given and we have to determine the interaction strength @xmath25 .",
    "after all , we have to ensure that the approximation is valid for all @xmath67 where @xmath68 is some a priori given upper bound on the time required by the clock wave to pass the relevant region on the lattice , i.e. , the region containing the spin - spin interactions which will be described in the next section .",
    "the effective hamiltonian leads to a quantum walk on the space of atom configurations which will be diagonalized in section [ sec : diag ] . in the next section",
    "we will explain how this walk may trigger the implementation of gates .",
    "now we consider not only the positions of the atoms but also their inner degree of freedom , e.g. their spin .",
    "we replace the qubit at each lattice site with a qutrit and extend hence the space @xmath13 to @xmath69 the basis states @xmath70 indicate the absence of the atom or its two possible spin states , respectively .",
    "before we describe how to add a spin - spin interaction hamiltonian to @xmath27 which leads to the implementation of gates when the atoms are moving along the rows , we should first mention two obvious approaches to imprint gates by interactions and why they are not suitable for our goal .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the gates are directly coupled ( as additional _ tensor product _",
    "components ) to the synchronization hamiltonian .",
    "certainly we could define the hopping term in eq .",
    "( [ vham ] ) between column @xmath71 and @xmath72 in any desired row such that the spin is not conserved during the atom propagation but subjected to some rotation .",
    "this would provide us with one - qubit gates .",
    "such a one - qubit gate would clearly be inverted when the atom moves back to column @xmath71 again .",
    "the conditional state of the considered qubit , given that the atom is found on the right of column @xmath71 would hence be subjected to the desired transformation , no matter whether the atom has traveled back and forth several times as is is typical for a random walk .",
    "to imprint two - qubit gates into the hamiltonian is more difficult .",
    "the obvious method to couple their implementation with some coupled motion of two adjacent atoms would require more non - local interactions than only two - particle terms .",
    "the second obvious method would be to complete the clock hamiltonian by an _ additive _ spin - spin interaction term between some adjacent sites in the same column .",
    "this leads to the following problems .",
    "first the atoms do not stay there for a well - defined time .",
    "some part of the wave packet moves already and one part stays .",
    "second the atoms travel back and forth and pass the interaction region several times .",
    "both effects would in general entangle atom position and logical spin states in an uncontrollable way .",
    "a solution to the latter problem is holonomic quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the idea of this approach , in the usual setting , is that some time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath73 is adiabatically changed along a closed loop such that , on an appropriate degenerate subspace , the overall effect is a unitary which depends only on the loop ( described by representing @xmath73 in some parameter space ) and not on the speed of the change of @xmath73 .",
    "the unitary in the end remains the same even if the vector @xmath73 has been moving back and forth on this loop in the parameter space .",
    "we apply this concept to our model where we achieve the time - dependence of the spin - spin interaction by the motion of the atoms when they pass spatially inhomogeneous interactions .",
    "we imprint a spin - spin interaction ( varying slowly along the rows ) such that is describes a closed loop after the atoms have passed a certain region .",
    "then the spin state of the atoms does not depend on the time required for the passing , neither does it depend on the number of times the atoms were traveling back and forth before the whole region has been passed .",
    "this ensures that the entanglement between the position degree of freedom and the spin is lost as soon as the region has been passed by the whole atom chain .",
    "before we explain how to make use of this idea in detail , we rephrase a result in section ii of ref .",

    "then the probability of finding all atoms outside the circuit region tends to @xmath19 for @xmath216 .",
    "this theorem is also proven in the appendix .",
    "one should maybe mention the following limitation of our model : in a lattice with finite length @xmath0 the adiabatic approximation underlying the holonomic implementation is only true up to some error .",
    "therefore the implemented transformation , given that the atom chain has passed the circuit region , does not exactly coincide with the desired quantum circuit .",
    "instead , it depends to some extent on the time needed to pass the region . in the limit of averaging the time evolution over an infinite time interval",
    "this error will increase . roughly speaking ( and expressed in a too classical language )",
    ", the atom chain has then traveled back and forth many times and the error can increase since passing the circuit region backward would not necessarily invert the implemented circuit .",
    "however , it is a matter of the time scale on which the time average is taken whether this error is relevant , i.e. , the degree to which the adiabatic approximation is justified determines the time scale on which the time average is described by our analysis .",
    "to judge whether it is likely that systems with hamiltonians as above could be found in real systems would go beyond the scope of this article .",
    "maybe one should rather ask which modifications are possible for our models that would make them more feasible .",
    "so far , the required spin - spin interactions are quite specific .    to show that the required diagonal hopping is not a priori unphysical one could think of electrons on quantum dot arrays arranged as in fig .  [ figdiadots ]",
    ". the hopping along the rows does not require tunneling between distant dots even though it is the _ diagonal _ direction with respect to the square lattice .",
    "spin - spin interactions would then only be needed in the direction of the dashed square lattice .",
    "[ dots ]    attractive interactions between particles on adjacent dots could , for instance , be achieved if the particles alternate between electrons and holes from row to row .",
    "certainly , it will be difficult to find a system that combines the attractive interaction and the hopping with the spatially inhomogeneous spin - spin interactions .",
    "we have shown that nearest - neighbor interactions among qutrits located on a 2d square lattice can be designed in such a way that their autonomous time evolution simulates any desired quantum circuit .",
    "the hamiltonian given here is significantly simpler than that one given in our previous paper @xcite since the latter contained @xmath182-qubit interactions .",
    "however , the advantage of the hamiltonian in @xcite is that it is programmable .",
    "the hamiltonian given here contains the gates to be implemented already as hardware . in order to make a programmable quantum computer one could proceed as follows .",
    "consider a universal quantum cellular automaton in one dimension @xcite consisting of cells @xmath217 with @xmath218 .",
    "each cell contains a quantum system with hilbert space @xmath219 . using the so - called margolus partition scheme @xcite , one time step of the ca consists of two parts . the first one is given by identical copies of a unitary @xmath220 acting on all pairs @xmath221 , the second one by identical copies one could use a @xmath222-algebraic description and work with automorphisms on so - called quasilocal algebras @xcite . ] of @xmath131 acting on all pairs @xmath223 . in our scheme",
    ", we may represent each cell by the subspace of an appropriate number of adjacent logical qubits .",
    "then we cover some part of our 2d lattice with a pattern of interaction regions that implement unitaries @xmath220 and @xmath131 as shown in fig .  [ margo ] .",
    "the number of pairs of columns in this pattern determines the number of time steps of the simulated ca .",
    "the translation symmetry of such a crystal would then , however , be described by huge unit cells .",
    "nevertheless , our construction shows that translation invariant finite - range interactions among finite dimensional quantum systems can in principle implement a universally programmable quantum computer .",
    "we have shown that nearest - neighbor interactions on 2-dimensional lattices can induce dynamical evolutions that are powerful enough to represent a programmable quantum computer .",
    "even though we have not described a realistic implementation scheme we have given interactions which are not a priori unphysical .",
    "the main reason why it may be difficult to construct systems having exactly the hamiltonians considered here is that the spatial homogeneity of the interactions follow a rather sophisticated law .    to find even simpler hamiltonians which can perform quantum computing in a closed physical system is an interesting challenge for further research .",
    "part of this work was done during a visit of hans briegel s group at iqoqi , whose hospitality is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the model was inspired by discussions with robert raussendorf about cellular automata and with several people at iqoqi about optical lattices and quantum dots , especially gregor thalhammer and alessio recati .",
    "thanks also to pawel wocjan for encouraging remarks and helpful discussions .",
    "this work was partly funded by the landesstiftung baden - wrttemberg , project az1.1422.01 .",
    "the clocking scheme of our autonomous computer presented so far is somewhat sophisticated in the sense that the hopping terms connect lattice sites lying diagonal with respect to the grid given by the possible atom positions . in other words ,",
    "the rows defining the direction of atom propagation were _ diagonal _ with respect to the square lattice structure .",
    "it would be more natural to have tunneling along rows or columns of the square lattice itself .",
    "we will therefore describe an alternative model for the propagation of an atom chain which has , however , the disadvantage , that we can only conjecture that the atoms move in forward direction with sufficient speed and will appear outside the interaction region with reasonable probability .",
    "we can , however , prove , that the corresponding classical random walk would really implement the computation .",
    "the whole lattice consists of @xmath224 sites . for reasons that will become clear later , we will color the sites such that we obtain a pattern similar to a chess board . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ positionen ] the @xmath225 atoms start in the first column .",
    "in contrast to our first model , the white sites are used , too .",
    "the rules for the propagation of atoms along the rows are as follows .",
    "an atom on a white site is allowed to move forward or backwards by one column if the atoms in the two adjacent rows are currently in the same column .",
    "an atom on a black site is only allowed to move one column forward or backwards if it is finally located in between two adjacent atoms in the same column . in the first column ,",
    "only the atoms on the white sites are allowed to move forward . a possible configuration obtained by applying these rules",
    "is shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ positionen ] .    by induction",
    ", we will argue that the configuration of atoms has always the following properties :    1 .",
    "atoms located in adjacent rows are either in the same column or in adjacent columns .",
    "2 .   for every atom located on a white site",
    "there are always atoms on the two adjacent black sites in the same column .",
    "the only exception are particles on white sites in the upper - most and lower - most rows which have certainly only one black neighbor .",
    "it is clear that these conditions are satisfied by the initial state . in order to prove that they are preserved we observe that an atom that is located on a black site can only move to a white site if the latter is adjacent to two occupied black sites .",
    "but then it will satisfy condition ( 2 ) .",
    "when an atom on a white site moves to a black site , condition ( 1 ) is certainly preserved since ( 2 ) was true for its initial position .",
    "the atoms being on black sites on the boundary can only move to column @xmath71 when the atom in the row below is already in column @xmath71 .",
    "now we present a hamiltonian that induces these propagation rules .",
    "we start with @xmath226 which is a usual hopping term ( as it appears in hubbard models @xcite ) annihilating the atom at a certain position and creating it at the right or left neighboring site in the same row .",
    "physically , one could think of an optical lattice with periodic potentials generated by standing waves which result from the superposition of counter - propagating waves @xcite . to allow tunneling in horizontal direction and to avoid it along the vertical axis one could use high potential walls between rows and low potential walls between columns .",
    "this can be achieved by a superposition of high amplitude waves in vertical direction with low amplitude waves in horizontal direction .",
    "now we modify the lattice such that there are two types of minima in the potential .",
    "the lower potential corresponds to the black sites and the higher potential to the white sites . by superposition of two lattices with wave length @xmath85 and @xmath227 one could also generate a chess - board like alternating potential (",
    "this is called a `` superlattice '' in @xcite ) .",
    "we describe the alternating potential by introducing an additional term @xmath228 where @xmath229 denotes the set of black sites .",
    "furthermore we introduce an attractive interaction between atoms in adjacent rows which is only active between pairs of atoms that are in the same column .",
    "the strength of the attractive interaction has strength @xmath25 , i.e. , we add a term @xmath230 this ensures that all the allowed atom configurations have the same energy : when an atom sitting on a white site moves to a black one the attractive interaction is switched off , this compensates the energy gap between the black and the white site .",
    "the same is true for an atom on a black field that moves to a white field since the attractive interaction is then switched on . for the upper - most and the lower - most rows we need to decrease the energy gap between black and white sites because there is only one attractive interaction compensating it .",
    "we achieve this by adding a potential @xmath231 given the hamiltonian @xmath232 , one checks easily that an allowed forward or backward motion of an atom leads to a configuration with the same energy .",
    "moreover , one can see that every step of an atom that violates the propagation rules would lead to a state with different energy .",
    "we observe furthermore that forbidden motions would always lead to a configuration with higher energy and never to lower energy .",
    "this additional feature provides the scheme with some thermodynamical stability .",
    "now we add the small perturbation @xmath31 ( @xmath25 is again thought to be large ) to the potentials and obtain @xmath233 in analogy to the discussion of our first model we obtain an effective hamiltonian that is given by @xmath234 where @xmath32 is projecting onto the subspace of states having the same energy as the initial atom configuration .",
    "the effective hamiltonian modifies the hopping terms such that they are multiplied by an additional number operator checking the position of the atoms in adjacent rows .",
    "in other words , each term of the form @xmath235 as well as those of the form @xmath236 are only active if the two black fields are occupied which are either the current two neighbors of the considered atom ( if the latter is located on a white site ) or the future two neighbors ( if it moves to a white site ) .",
    "explicitly , we get therefore @xmath237 the operators @xmath140 of these @xmath48-local terms act on black sites in the same column .    to implement one - qubit gates in this scheme , we imprint interactions as shown in fig .  [ 2erfig ] .",
    "the interactions @xmath115 are chosen as in section  [ holo ] .",
    "a decisive difference to our first model is that the hopping of the atoms does not turn @xmath94 on immediately after @xmath238 was turned off . instead ,",
    "the atoms pass always a configuration where all interactions are turned off .",
    "however , this is irrelevant for the holonomic scheme because the statement of lemma  [ adia ] remains certainly true if the evolution is interspersed by time intervals where @xmath73 is completely switched off .    to implement two - qubit gates",
    ", we design the spin - spin interactions as depicted in fig .",
    "[ 3erfig ] .",
    "now we have described how interactions can be imprinted that would implement the desired gates given that the whole atom chain passes indeed the circuit region .    however , as already stated , it seems to be difficult to derive explicit formulas for the dynamical evolution .",
    "we will therefore only consider the corresponding classical random walk and argue that one will have at least probability @xmath239 to find all particles outside the circuit region in the time average . here the circuit region is defined by the first @xmath172 columns of the chess - board where @xmath172 is chosen such that the region contains all interaction stripes .",
    "the computation result is then obtained by measuring the spin of the particles after they have left the circuit region .",
    "the classical random walk would describe the physical dynamics in the limit of strongly incoherent atom hopping .",
    "the incoherent model is , of course inconsistent with our intention to study computation in a closed physical system .",
    "the motivation to study the classical walk is that the result gives us some _ small hope _ that the coherent walk behaves also as it is required for computation even though it may clearly be very different from the classical random walk .",
    "let @xmath240 be the set of allowed atom configurations on the @xmath224-chess - board and @xmath241 be the graph with nodes @xmath240 .",
    "two nodes @xmath242 are adjacent if @xmath243 can be reached from @xmath244 by an allowed step of an atom .",
    "the probability distribution on the set of possible atom configurations at some time instant @xmath245 is described by a vector @xmath246 having the @xmath105 nodes of @xmath241 as indices .",
    "then a continuous classical random walk on @xmath241 is described by @xcite @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the graph laplacian .",
    "its entries are @xmath249 for @xmath250 if @xmath3 is adjacent , and @xmath251 where @xmath252 is the degree of node @xmath71 , i.e. , its number of neighbors . since @xmath241 is connected , @xmath253 is a non - degenerate eigenvalue of @xmath248 @xcite and there is hence a unique stationary distribution .",
    "the latter is clearly invariant if we replace each atom configuration with the configuration obtained by reflecting it at the vertical symmetry axis of the chess - board .",
    "the latter is defined by a line between column @xmath254 and @xmath255 if @xmath179 , where we have assumed that @xmath179 is even for simplicity .",
    "therefore the probability of finding at least one atom of the chain in the right half is at least @xmath239 .",
    "since the chain does not tear this implies that the column index of every atom is at least @xmath256 .",
    "provided that @xmath257 we find with probability at least @xmath239 all atoms outside the circuit region .",
    "we have a dominating hamiltonian @xmath29 and a weak perturbation @xmath31 . in order to use a perturbation theorem of @xcite",
