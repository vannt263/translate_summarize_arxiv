    "the study of hyperon production in hadron induced multi particle exit channels like @xmath4 involves several aspects .",
    "the nucleon ",
    "hyperon interaction can be extracted by analyzing the @xmath5 subsystem in the appropriate kinematical region . closely related to that",
    "is the issue of the reaction mechanisms of the hyperon production which have to be clarified for an unambiguous interpretation of the data .",
    "if the hyperon production is due to the excitation and a subsequent decay of intermediate nucleon resonances than information about the structure of the relevant resonances can be extracted .",
    "the excitation function near threshold shows a clear deviation from a pure s  wave phase space distribution , and the proton  hyperon final state interaction ( fsi ) has to be included to describe the data  @xcite . in the channel",
    "the @xmath6 fsi seems to be negligible and the pure s  wave phase space calculations follow the data points reasonably well .",
    "the cross section ratio @xmath7 below excess energies of @xmath8 20  mev is about 28  @xcite in contrast to the value of about 2.5 determined for excess energies higher than @xmath9 mev @xcite ( see figure  [ all_models ] ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the @xmath10 isospin relation .",
    "the question arises if this drastic increase of the cross section ratio near threshold is a mere effect of the @xmath11 fsi or wether it is partly due to the reaction mechanisms in the @xmath5 channels . to explain the increase of the @xmath12 cross section ratio in the near threshold region ,",
    "different scenarios were proposed .",
    "calculations of the strangeness production based on incoherent @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchange have been performed in ref .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath16 scattering amplitudes for pion and kaon exchange , respectively , were taken from the existing data in the higher energy region  @xcite .",
    "incoherent @xmath17 exchange model _ describes the cross section over the whole energy range , however in the near threshold region the channel is overestimated , and thus the predicted @xmath12 ratio is too low for @xmath18 20 mev ( see curve ( 1 ) in figure  [ all_models ] ) .",
    "a better description of the strong rise of the ratio towards lower @xmath1-values is achieved by the _ resonance model _",
    "( curve ( 2 ) in figure  [ all_models ] )  @xcite . in this model",
    "the nonresonant direct contributions like @xmath13 or @xmath14 exchange were not included , but the @xmath13 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 meson exchange with the excitation of the intermediate baryonic resonances @xmath21(1650 ) , @xmath21(1710 ) , @xmath21(1720 ) and @xmath22(1920 ) are taken into account . in this _ resonance model _ the near threshold region of the @xmath12",
    "cross section ratio seems to be better reproduced than the higher energy values .",
    "it should be stressed that in these calculations the parameters were fixed on the basis of higher energy data , before the near threshold @xmath3 and @xmath23 data were available .",
    "other calculations by shyam  @xcite ( based on the _ effective lagrangian model _ ) for the strangeness production include meson exchange ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) together with the excitation of resonances .",
    "the coupling constant was determined from data of the @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 reaction channels .",
    "the coherent sum of resonant states and meson exchange processes describe the experimental data for the and channels very well .",
    "the _ effective lagrangian model _ is depicted by the curve ( 3 ) in figure  [ all_models ] .",
    "the jlich theory group has performed calculations including @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchange @xcite . in their approach the interaction between the hyperons ( @xmath3 , @xmath29 ) and the nucleon",
    "is described by a microscopic ( @xmath3n-@xmath29n ) coupled channel model @xcite with a coherent superposition of the production amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath3 production is dominated by the @xmath14 exchange and therefore the contribution due to an interference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchange is negligible in this hyperon channel . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchanges give a comparable contribution to the cross section in the case of @xmath2 production .",
    "an interference between @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchange amplitudes act very differently on the two channels . within the _ jlich meson exchange model _",
    "the large cross section ratio can be described by a destructive interference of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 exchange amplitudes only . for excess energies above 20 mev the model is not valid any more but qualitatively the cross section ratio given by the model stays at a nearly constant level .",
    "although the various descriptions of the cross section ratio differ even in the dominant reaction mechanism , all reproduce more or less the trend of an increase of the @xmath12 cross section ratio in the threshold region ( see figure  [ all_models ] ) .",
    "the present data are not sufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant reaction mechanism .",
    "to clarify this point further data are needed .",
    "especially the other isospin channels should allow information about the production mechanisms to be extracted .",
    "recently , after the installation of a neutron detector in addition to the @xmath3 and @xmath2 production the reaction channel became accessible at the detection system .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath30 hyperon production via this reaction was performed at two beam momenta , and @xmath31 = 2.74 gev / c , corresponding to excess energies of 13 mev and 60 mev , respectively .",
    "is an internal magnetic spectrometer at the cooler synchroton and storage ring cosy  @xcite in jlich .",
    "the interaction between a proton in the beam and a proton from the @xmath32 cluster target  @xcite may lead to the production of the @xmath0 hyperon in the reaction .",
    "the charged reaction products are separated from the circulating beam in the magnetic field of one of the regular cosy dipoles  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 hyperon is identified via the missing mass technique by detecting the @xmath33 and the neutron .",
    "the momentum vector ( @xmath34 ) of the @xmath33 meson can be determined by tracking the @xmath33 trajectory reconstructed in the drift chambers ( dc1 and dc2 in figure  [ tracks ] ) through the known magnetic field back to the target point .",
    "the momentum vector together with the velocity ( @xmath35 ) measurement in the two scintillators s8 and s1 are used to identify the kaon via its invariant mass @xmath36 .    assuming that a hit in the neutron detector is from a neutron , the four momentum vector of the neutron is calculated by the measured velocity , the direction of the neutron ( given by the first module hit ) and the known mass .",
    "the background from charged particles incident on the neutron detector is discriminated by veto scintillators .    in figure  [ mm1-fig ]",
    "the experimental distributions of the squared missing mass ( @xmath37 ) of the system for the two beam momenta are shown .",
    "for the higher momentum , an enhancement around the squared @xmath38 mass is clearly seen on a large background ( figure  [ mm1-fig]b ) , but for the lower beam momentum ( figure  [ mm1-fig]a ) a @xmath38 peak is not directly visible .    in order to determine the number of @xmath0 events in the higher energy data set , the background has been parametrized by a polynomial function which is added to the expected missing mass distribution of the @xmath39 system for the reaction obtained from simulation studies . in figure  [ mmh_wielo - reac]a the experimental missing mass spectrum of the system",
    "is compared with the fitted polynomial function .",
    "the expected distribution from monte - carlo studies with @xmath40 is depicted in the figure as well .",
    "figure  [ mmh_wielo - reac]b shows the result of the subtraction of the polynomial from the experimental missing mass distribution together with the monte - carlo distribution .    in order to understand the background distribution ,",
    "22 reaction channels ( mostly multi - pion reactions but also @xmath41 ) were simulated and their contributions to the missing mass distribution were determined .",
    "these studies showed that the reactions , and are the dominant background channels in the @xmath38 region .",
    "the monte carlo code includes the realistic geometry and physics processes like energy loss and straggling which occasionally cause the misidentification of the particle type .",
    "all background channels result in a rather smooth distribution of the missing mass spectrum as can be inferred from calculations from monte - carlo studies and by comparing the two experimental distributions ( see figure  [ mm1-fig ] ) .    for the lower energy data set a @xmath38 peak is not obviously visible via the missing mass distribution .",
    "therefore , a simple polynomial background parametrization can not be used . to determine the number of @xmath38 events it was assumed that the background shape for this data set is the same as that at the higher energy .",
    "this assumption is justified since there are no new open channels for the higher energy .    at the cosy-11 experiment the shape of the missing mass distribution",
    "is mainly determined by the acceptance of the detection system and is dependent on the excess energy of an individual event . from the analysis of @xmath19 and @xmath42 production studies at cosy-11",
    "it was verified that the background shape resulting here mainly from multi pion production is in very good agreement with the expectations from monte carlo studies taking into account the detector characteristics and is comparable at different beam momenta .",
    "in addition , monte carlo data of the reaction channels which contribute dominantly to the background in the @xmath43 production were compared in view of the background shape by adjusting the kinematical limits . within error",
    "bars their shapes were identical .",
    "therefore it is justified to assume that the background shape is the same for both beam momenta . for a detailed discussion on the background shape at cosy-11",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the background shape from the experimental missing mass distribution for the higher energy data set was shifted such that the kinematical limits for both spectra were the same .",
    "afterwards , it was added to the missing mass distribution of the reaction which was determined from monte - carlo studies at the lower energy ( see figure  [ mml_fit - reac ] ) .",
    "the relative magnitudes were determined by the @xmath44 minimisation of the functional forms to the data sample at lower energy .",
    "for the lower energy data set , no clear enhancement near the kaon mass in the invariant mass distribution is visible . therefore the assumption was made , that the kaon peak in the experimental distribution has the same position and width as in the simulated distribution .    as a cross check ,",
    "event samples in different regions of experimental invariant mass but still within the expected range for kaons were taken and the missing mass distributions were determined .",
    "the assumed background shape was subtracted from the experimental distribution and the enhancement around the mass of the @xmath0 was interpreted as a signal from the @xmath0 hyperon ( see figure  [ mml_fit - reac ] ) .",
    "this procedure was repeated for five different invariant mass regions and the number of events under the remaining peak was determined .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ inv_scan ] .",
    "the vertical error bars correspond to the statistical error of the number of events .",
    "the horizontal error bars indicate the widths of the appropriate invariant mass intervals . in figure  [ inv_scan ]",
    "curve ( 1 ) shows the expected invariant mass distribution of kaons from monte - carlo calculations .",
    "curve ( 2 ) is a gauss fit to the experimentally determined number of @xmath0 events in the different invariant mass regions .",
    "this can be interpreted as an experimental distribution of kaons .",
    "the assumed experimental kaon invariant mass distribution is consistent with the distribution expected from monte - carlo studies .",
    "for the higher beam momentum a kaon peak is clearly visible in the invariant mass distribution and can be fit by a gauss function . in a systematical study of the result at the higher beam momentum",
    "three different selections on the experimental invariant mass distribution were applied .",
    "events from the following regions : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 centered around the nominal reconstructed mass ( @xmath48 ) were taken and the corresponding missing mass distributions were generated .",
    "@xmath49 is the experimental resolution of this observable .",
    "next the number of @xmath0 events for each of these distributions was determined .",
    "the results are listed in the middle column of table  [ number_higher ] and in the last column the number of the @xmath0 events corresponding to the full gaussian distribution .",
    ".[number_higher ] the number of @xmath0 events as a function of the width of the invariant mass range .",
    "only statistical errors are given . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      among the models described in the introduction only two give predictions for the reaction , namely the _ jlich meson exchange model _  @xcite and the _ resonance model _  @xcite",
    ". calculations of the @xmath0 production within the _ jlich meson exchange model _ predict a total cross section of at @xmath1 = 13 mev for the destructive interference ( which was necessary to describe the high @xmath50 cross section ratio at threshold ) .",
    "this is about a factor of 20 below the experimental value of 4.56 @xmath51b given in table [ results - tab - sys ] .",
    "a constructive interference would result in a cross section even a factor of 53 too low .",
    "for the _ resonance model _ the predictions for the channel for the near threshold region deviate even more from the data . in figure  [ res - sib ] the model predictions and the available data for the ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c )",
    "channels are shown .",
    "the filled data points presented by triangles , dots and squares in the near threshold region were measured by the collaboration  @xcite . the data point in the channel indicated by the arrow",
    "was determined in parallel to this work by selecting the @xmath52 exit channel which was included in the events sample at 2.74 gev / c .",
    "the high energy data for the given reactions were taken from  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the model calculations for each channel are given by the solid lines  @xcite .",
    "the data point for the channel at is underestimated in the total cross section calculated using the resonance model @xcite by about a factor of 500 and for by about a factor of 50 .",
    "for the channel , this model calculation describes the existing data set and in the case of the channel the underestimation of the cross section in the near threshold region is about a factor of 16 being 30 times smaller than for the @xmath0 production . at high excess energies , the @xmath0 data points are by factor 3  4 below the model calculations .",
    "previous hyperon production studies conclude that final state interactions ( fsi ) plays an important role in the near threshold @xmath3 production  @xcite . in the _ resonance model _",
    "the fsi is not included  @xcite and therefore the deviation of the model calculations from the data points in the near threshold region is expected if a strong fsi is present .",
    "this effect is clearly seen for the and barely observed for the reaction channel .",
    "investigations of hyperon production in  @xcite indicate that the data can not be described by a pure 3-body phase space ( ps ) dependent cross section expressed as  @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath14 is a normalization factor and @xmath1 the excess energy .",
    "therefore a modification is needed which takes into account the _ proton - hyperon _ fsi . in order to describe the near threshold region , the parametrisation of the excitation function including the fsi proposed by fldt - wilkin  @xcite was used .",
    "it is expressed by :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are parameters related to the fsi strength .    in figure",
    "[ fw - all ] the cross sections for different production channels for the @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 hyperons are compared to predictions based on the 3body phase space ( ps , dotted line ) and the 3body phase space calculations modified by the @xmath6 fsi ( ps + fsi , solid line ) , following equation  [ fw - eq ] with @xmath57 and @xmath55 as free parameters .",
    "these parameters are related to the scattering length _ a _ and the effective range _",
    "r _ of the @xmath6 potential  @xcite .    for the data the resulting @xmath56 and @xmath55 parameters",
    "have similar values as for the channel .",
    "it seems that for the @xmath0 production via the reaction a rather strong @xmath58 fsi is present , however , within the error bars also the curve obtained without fsi describes the two data points .",
    "therefore an unambiguous conclusion about the @xmath58 fsi requires more data to disentangle the reaction mechanisms and especially the role of nuclear resonances .",
    "the total cross section of the reaction was determined by means of the detection system for excess energies of @xmath1 = 13 and 60 mev .",
    "the values established are more than an order of magnitude larger than the expectations of currently available model predictions .",
    "the unexpected large total @xmath0 production cross section is consistent with an observation by tan  @xcite who concluded that when assuming charge symmetry in @xmath59 and @xmath60 scattering , the contribution from the @xmath2 diagram is less than one seventh of the contribution from the @xmath0 channel .",
    "further , recently it was suggested that for the @xmath61 production  @xcite a strong enhancement of the reaction amplitude towards threshold might be due to the presence of a crypto exotic baryon with hidden strangeness .",
    "although this observation is not directly applicable to other isospin channels , ( in the @xmath62 system no corresponding structure was observed ) it might be a hint of an exotic mechanism . in any case , present theoretical predictions of the cross sections strongly underestimate the experimental data .",
    "the comparison of the excitation function expected based upon phase space distribution including @xmath63 fsi to the data results in fsi parameters comparable to the @xmath64 system .",
    "this may indicate a strong @xmath58 interaction but due to the large systematic uncertainties the data are also consistent with a pure phase space distribution without @xmath58 fsi .",
    "further studies of the @xmath0 production are necessary to clarify the picture . on the experimental side",
    "additional data points should be added for which an improved event selectivity is favorable to reduce the large uncertainties introduced by the background subtraction .",
    "a @xmath65 detection system for neutral and charged particles which will be soon available with wasa at cosy could be used  @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    "an improved model has to be developed which consistently reproduces the hyperon cross section data near threshold .",
    "this work has been supported by the european community - access to research infrastructure action of the improving human potential programme , by the ffe grants ( 41266606 and 41266654 ) from the research center jlich , by the daad exchange programme ( ppp - polen ) , and by the polish state committee for scientific research ( grant no .",

    "during the evaluation process of the article we have been made aware of the predictions of the excitation function of the total cross section for the reaction which is closer to the data in comparison with the models discussed , yet still underpredict the determined total cross sections by more than an order of magnitude  @xcite .",
