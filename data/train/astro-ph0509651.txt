    "neutral hydrogen atoms in the early universe can be detected in absorption or emission against the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) at redshifted radio wavelength 21 cm , depending upon whether their spin temperature @xmath6 is less than or greater than that of the cmb , respectively .",
    "minihalos which form during the `` dark ages '' have density and temperature high enough to appear in emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , on the other hand , appears in either emission or absorption .",
    "new radio telescopes are being designed to detect this 21 cm signal .",
    "* isfm hereafter ) showed that atomic collisions inside minihalos are sufficient to decouple the spin temperature of the neutral hydrogen from the cmb temperature .",
    "they predicted the mean and angular fluctuations of the corresponding 21 cm signal by a semi - analytical calculation based upon integrating the individual minihalo contributions for different halo masses and redshifts , over the evolving statistical distribution of minihalo masses in the @xmath3cdm universe .",
    "the fluctuations , they found , are substantial enough to be detectable with future radio telescopes .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have recently suggested that the gas in the diffuse igm ( prior to the onset of ly@xmath5 radiative pumping ) is also capable of producing the 21 cm emission signal and that the igm contribution to the mean signal will dominate over that from gas inside minihalos .    in order to quantify these effects ,",
    "we have computed the 21 cm signal both from minihalos and the igm at @xmath4 , using high - resolution cosmological n - body and hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation .",
    "we use a flat , @xmath3cdm cosmology with matter density parameter @xmath7 , cosmological constant @xmath8 , baryon density @xmath9 , hubble constant @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the harrison - zeldovich primordial power spectrum .",
    "foreground emission or absorption by neutral hydrogen atoms at redshift @xmath12 is seen against the cmb at redshifted wavelength , @xmath13 .",
    "the spin temperature ( @xmath6 ) of a hydrogen atom determines whether the signal is in emission or absorption .",
    "emission occurs when @xmath14 , while absorption occurs when @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath6 can deviate from @xmath16 in various ways .",
    "a hydrogen atom can 1 ) absorb a 21 cm photon from cmb ( cmb pumping ) , 2 ) collide with another atom ( collisional pumping ) and 3 ) absorb a ly@xmath5 photon to make a ly@xmath5 transition , then decay to one of hyperfine 21 cm levels ( ly@xmath5 pumping ) .    during the dark ages , when there is no ly@xmath5 pumping , the mean 21 cm signal against the cmb will be zero at @xmath17 , then in absorption at @xmath18 mostly due to unperturbed igm , and finally in emission at @xmath19 due primarily to minihalos .",
    "we restrict ourselves to regions such that the ly@xmath5 pumping is negligible even after sources turn on at @xmath19 . in other words",
    ", we only consider collisional pumping in minihalos and the igm at @xmath20 .      here",
    "we briefly summarize the semi - analytical calculation of the 21 cm signal from minihalos by isfm and from the unperturbed igm . for minihalos ,",
    "the differential brightness temperature , @xmath21 is averaged over individual minihalos to give the mean differential antenna temperature @xmath22 ( for detail , see isfm ) .",
    "on the other hand , the unperturbed igm of the universe has a kinetic temperature smaller than the cmb temperature at @xmath23 , resulting in an absorption signal until collisional pumping becomes negligible at @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ [ fig - anal ] ] ) .",
    "we have run a high resolution cosmological n - body and gasdynamic simulation to derive the effects of gravitational collapse and hydrodynamics on the predicted 21 cm signal from the high redshift universe .",
    "our computational box has a comoving size of @xmath25 , with @xmath26 cells and @xmath27 dark matter particles , which is optimal for adequately resolving both the minihalos and small - scale structure - formation shocks .",
    "we have used the code described in @xcite , which uses the particle - mesh ( pm ) scheme for calculating the gravity evolution and an eulerian total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme for hydrodynamics .    in order to calculate the minihalo and the igm contributions to the total differential brightness temperature",
    ", one needs first to identify the halos in the simulation volume .",
    "we identified the halos using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( @xcite ) with a linking length parameter of @xmath28 . the rest of the signal is considered to be from the igm .    in figure",
    "[ maps ] , we show projected maps for three different redshifts . each contribution from minihalos and the igm is also plotted .",
    "it clearly shows that the signal is in absorption due to the igm at @xmath29 , and after crossing the moment when a mixture of emission from minihalos and absorption from the igm exists ( @xmath30 ) , the signal is predominantly in emission both from minihalos and the igm at @xmath19 . in figure [ fig-0.25-numerical ] ,",
    "we show the total signal as well as minihalos and the igm contributions .",
    "our numerical simulations have sufficiently high resolution to find all of the minihalos in the computational box , as well as the large - scale structure formation shocks , but not to resolve the internal structure of the minihalos themselves . as isfm",
    "have shown , in order to obtain the correct 21-cm signal from minihalos one needs to do a full radiative transfer calculation through each individual minihalo density profile since , unlike the igm gas , minihalos have a non - negligible optical depth at the 21-cm line .",
    "hence , we can refine our estimate of the minihalo contribution to the total 21-cm signal by combining our numerical halo catalogues with the semi - analytic calculation of individual minihalo contribution as found by isfm .    in their approach , the gas density of each minihalo is assumed to follow the tis profile , of @xcite , the radiative transfer calculation is performed for different impact parameters , and then finally the face - averaged @xmath31 is calculated ( see isfm for details ) , according to @xmath32 the halo mass function , @xmath33 , is provided here , not by the analytical ps mass function as in isfm , however , but by the halo catologue we construct from the simulation . each individual halo contribution , @xmath34 , depends on its mass and redshift of formation ( isfm ) .",
    "once we calculate @xmath34 , we then obtain the halo contribution using equation  ( [ eq - dtb ] ) .",
    "we find that the emission signal at @xmath19 is dominated by minihalos . for @xmath35 , about @xmath36 of the total signal is contributed by minihalos .",
    "the minihalo contribution peaks at @xmath37 , because the igm is in both emission and absorption . at @xmath24 ,",
    "the igm is mostly in absorption , with an absolute amplitude which is comparable to the minihalo emission signal .",
    "only when the collapsed fraction of baryons into minihalos is negligible ( @xmath29 ) , does the igm make the dominant contribution to the total signal , which is in absorption .",
    "note that the total signal at @xmath38 is slightly stronger than the analytical value for the unperturbed igm , because clumping of the igm makes the collisional coupling of the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature slightly stronger .",
    "we have performed a cosmological n - body and hydrodynamic simulation of the evolution of dark matter and baryonic gas in the @xmath3cdm universe at high redshifts ( @xmath39 ) . with the assumption that radiative feedback effects from the first light sources are negligible , we calculated the 21 cm mean differential brightness temperature signal .",
    "the mean global signal is in absorption against the cmb above @xmath40 and in overall emission below @xmath41 . at @xmath42 , the density fluctuations of the igm gas",
    "are largely in the linear regime , and their absorption signal is well approximated by the one that results from assuming uniform gas at the mean adiabatically - cooled igm temperature . at @xmath43 , nonlinear structures become common , both minihalos and clumpy , warm , mildly nonlinear igm , resulting in an overall emission at 21 cm with differential brightness temperature of order a few mk .    by identifying the halos in our simulations , we were able to separate and compare the relative contributions of the halos and the igm gas to the total signal .",
    "we find that the emission from minihalos dominates over that from the igm outside minihalos , for @xmath44 .",
    "the minihalos contribute @xmath45 of the total emission signal at @xmath46 , exceeding @xmath47 at @xmath48 , and balancing the absorption by the igm gas at @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast , the absorption by cold igm gas dominates the total signal for @xmath50 , with a signal close to that of an unperturbed igm .",
