    "in recent years the role of fluctuations , spatial anisotropy and frustration in low dimensional quantum magnets has been intensely studied , both experimentally and theoretically.@xcite for a comparison of experiments with theory it is crucial to have well defined crystalline materials where one or several parameters can be varied externally in order to obtain quantitative predictions for physical observables . moreover , in order to observe interesting magnetic many - body effects it is essential to have materials where the magnetic moments are coupled via sufficiently strong exchange interactions .",
    "these conditions are met by transition metal oxides such as cuprates , vanadates , copper - germanates , or manganites , which have been the subject of many works . however , in these materials it is rather difficult to control externally microscopic parameters such as the precise values of the exchange interactions or the lattice geometry by changing the chemical composition in a well defined manner .",
    "this problem tends to be less severe in magnets based on metal - organic materials , which offer more possibilities of modifying some constituents chemically and thereby tuning the properties by a crystal engineering strategy .",
    "the challenge is then to find metal - organic magnets where the magnetic moments are coupled sufficiently strongly to exhibit interesting collective effects .",
    "these effects are of particular importance in low - dimensional magnets , e.g.  @xmath10 layer structures with strong magnetic couplings within the layers and weak interactions between the layers .",
    "such layer structures can be built up chemically from spin - bearing metal ions , which are connected by short bridges , being separated by organic fragments of considerable size , see fig .",

    "the relative weakness of these interactions is reflected by the morphology of the crystals : the crystals grow in ( @xmath24 ) and ( @xmath25 ) direction much faster than in ( @xmath26 ) direction , thus forming thin plates parallel to the ( @xmath27 ) plane .",
    "the magnetism is due to the @xmath28 manganese ions which form a distorted honeycomb pattern parallel to the ( @xmath27 ) planes .",

    "[ fig : lattice ] reveals that @xmath39 acts along two exchange paths while @xmath40 results from a single exchange path",
