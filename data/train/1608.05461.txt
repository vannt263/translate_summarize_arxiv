    "identifying who is performing which action has been deemed as one of the most important multimedia applications . for example , with the emergence of smart space , sensing human actions or activities automatically becomes essential .",
    "moreover , with identification , user s information can be used to trigger specific customization such as temperature or illumination adjustment in room , content shown on television etc .",
    "several action recognition methods have been deployed , such as learning trajectory @xcite , and an 90% accuracy has been achieved among most vision - based works .",
    "however , cameras might not be applicable in every place and scenario .",
    "for example , in restroom where privacy is of the first priority or in places where lighting is scarce , cameras are of little use . nevertheless , action recognition could not be spared in these places .",
    "for instance , timely detection of falling in a bathroom limits the damage to minimum .",
    "hence , previous works proposed using wearable devices such as accelerometers to obtain the speed profile and detect the action @xcite . those solutions",
    ", however , require users to wear devices all the time , which is unrealistic in some scenarios like taking a shower .",
    "hence , one might prefer a non - contact method , avoiding intruding in users daily life . to achieve identification ,",
    "the most intuitive and popular way is face recognition .",
    "though , a pretty high accuracy has been achieved with the power of deep learning @xcite , most works analyze on frontal faces , and in fact , side - view recognition is still very challenging .",
    "some researchers proposed to identify a person through gait analysis from sensor data . yet , as the problem mentioned above , users would prefer a device - free solution . given the flaws of the aforementioned methods , wi - fi leaps out at researchers radar .",
    "preliminary research on rf - based action recognition collects raw signals received by usrp , a software defined radio , and tracks the timestamps of motion @xcite .",
    "however , commercial aps do not provide raw signals , urging later works @xcite to seek for a more practical solution that analyzes on csi obtained from the modified driver @xcite .",
    "we also realize our work based on this csi toolkit .",
    "though extensive efforts have been put into csi - based action recognition , to the best of our knowledge , most existing works extract ad - hoc features which might encounter accuracy degradation as environments change . on the other hand , prior work on identification",
    "@xcite utilizes antenna array along with tailored devices to recognize the person standing behind the wall , triggering us to achieve identification via commercial aps .",
    "we , interestingly , observe that a csi - transformed image actually has some special texture appearances .",
    "hence , in this work , we also use the csi toolkit , but aim at investigating a general vision - based solution for action recognition and user identification .",
    "the fundamental challenge of such a vision - based method is how to exclude the effect of location dependent information typically embedded in the captured csi . to overcome this issue , we proposed a de - noising method based on svd to improve reliability of cross - environment performance .",
    "we further extend our vision - based framework to identify users , and verify its accuracy for various distances , packets sampling rates and outfits .",
    "our contributions include :    * we provide an overview on action recognition and person identification via wi - fi . * to our best knowledge",
    ", we are the first to investigate the feasibility of processing csi by vision - based methods with extendible learning - based framework @xcite . * despite of the promising performance in one room , we enable cross - environment action recognition by removing location dependency via the svd - based de - noise method @xcite . * we further experimentally verify the possibility of using our vision - based framework to identify users , and discuss some factors that may affect performance and are worth future studies as open problems .",
    "in this section , we introduce some related works using wireless signals with divergent aspects . in table [ tab : compare ] , we compare the main differences among these works in order to differentiate our works with other researches .      from the frequency aspect ,",
    "if we view human body as a source of reflected signals , when the user pushes toward a receiver , the relatively approaching speed causes a positive doppler shift at the receiver . on the contrary",
    ", a negative doppler shift occurs as the user s hand departs from the receiver . harnessing the doppler effect",
    ", @xcite achieves a 94% accuracy differentiating between nine gestures . as from the amplitude angle , since the total path from a transmitter to human body and to a receiver is shorten as pushing happens , the power dissipation decreases , rendering a rising amplitude on the receiver side . utilizing this phenomenon",
    ", @xcite successfully reduces the computational cost by performing analysis directly on the time domain signals with an 91% accuracy classifying four gestures . however , such raw signals are only available on special hardware such as usrp or warp , nudging researchers toward using csi , which can , in practice , be accessed from today s commodity devices and computed by the modified driver @xcite .      with csi , more actions and even human activities are successfully recognized , giving rise to many interesting applications .",
    "e - eyes  @xcite presents a user - feedback system , separating actions into walking and in - place activity , which is capable of identifying several trajectories and activities .",
    "wihear  citewihear processes csi for mouth motion profiles in order to read what people say .",
    "carm  @xcite leverages a pca - based de - noising method followed by discrete wavelet transformation , and supports human activity recognition independent of environment variances .",
    "nonetheless , parts of the features used in carm are related to the time duration of an action , which to our knowledge , might render classifiers highly vulnerable to duration estimation errors .",
    "also , despite the promising results , most works involve ad - hoc domain knowledge specifically related to the defined scenarios such as @xcite primarily designed for fall detection .",
    "besides csi from commercial aps , some researchers utilize directional antennas or antenna array to extract more detailed information , achieving a better localization resolution and realizing more powerful applications .",
    "rf - capture  @xcite designs a unique device using a t - shape antenna array and frequency chirp to identify persons through wall .",
    "the antenna array differentiates the direction of signals and the frequency chirp estimates the delay of received signals by constantly tuning the transmitted signals .",
    "witrack  @xcite uses a similar device to localize a person in 3d space through wall .",
    "these works are orthogonal to our work .",
    "requiring simply commercial aps with only omni - directional antennas , which are rather low - cost and ubiquitous , our framework can be deployed widely .",
    "in this section , we deeply dig into what csi is , how it could be used for vision - based methods and describe the location dependency embedded in csi .      as wi - fi waves propagate from a transmitter ( tx ) through the air to a receiver ( rx )",
    ", it bumps into objects and goes through several reflection , absorption , scattering or other effects caused by human or objects before reaching the receiver ( rx ) . when an action takes place , reflecting paths associated with human body differ",
    ". action recognition could thus be realized by observing the variation of the csi .",
    "current wi - fi transmitting protocols such as 802.11n implement ofdm ( orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ) for reducing interference and fading .",
    "it segments the bandwidth into several closely - spaced sub - carriers , each carrying a data stream . for more details about ofdm",
    "please refer to @xcite . as receiving signals",
    ", a receiver learns its channel state information ( csi ) , which is a complex number detailing the phase shift and power decay corresponding to the decay and propagation delay of multiple paths . in particular , we can formulate the communication model as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the transmitted signals , @xmath2 is the received signals , and @xmath3 is the csi , denoting the overall influence of the environment to @xmath1 . after decoding the received preambles or pilot bits , which are information both known by tx and rx , the receiver can learn the csi , i.e. , @xmath3 , by comparing the differences between @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "when an action happens , the number of reflecting paths and their distances change accordingly and thereby , by extracting information from the csi , one could classify the action performed .      from @xcite ,",
    "we know the amplitude of a sub - carrier with frequency _ f _ at time _ t _ could be expressed as _",
    "h(t , f ) _ in equation ( [ eq : cfr - simple ] ) , where _ h~s~(f ) _ is the aggregate channel of all the static paths , _",
    "h~d~(f , t ) _ is the aggregate channel of the dynamic paths and @xmath4 is the frequency offset between tx and rx .",
    "@xmath5    @xmath6 , where _ a~k~(f , t ) _ is attenuation of the _ k~th~ _ path at time _",
    "t _ and frequency _ f _ , _",
    "d~k~(t ) _ is the distance of _",
    "k~th~ _ path and _ p~d~ _ is the set of all dynamic paths .",
    "if an object moves at a constant speed , the distance of the _",
    "d~k~(t ) _ , could be expressed as _",
    "d~k~(t ) = d~k~(0 ) + v~k~_. thus the power of csi @xmath7 at time _",
    "t _ and frequency _ f _ can be derived as :    @size7.5@mathfonts @@@#1 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant given sub - carrier frequency @xmath10 and time @xmath11 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , represent initial phase offsets of transmitter and receiver .",
    "we observe that in equation ( [ eq : cfrcomplex ] ) , frequencies of cosine waves are determined by the action speed _ v~k~_. a faster speed leads to a larger phase change and renders denser stripes on transformed images , as shown in figure [ fig : cfr ] . since actions of different speeds present different textures on transformed images , we propose applying vision - based methods on transformed images .",
    "to elaborate on why csi embeds location information , we transform a frequency - domain csi profile collected from our testbed to the time domain by inverse fast fourier transformation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : ifft_result ] , the first tap usually represents the channel of the line - of - sight path ( with the shortest delay ) , and , hence , has the strongest amplitude . the rest of weaker taps consist of other static paths , reflected by nearby objects , and dynamic paths , reflected by human bodies .",
    "we can observe that , even after removing the strongest line - of - sight path , the remaining signal patterns in the two rooms are still very different because the reflected static paths change with environments and , more importantly , still have a relatively strong power , as compared to those reflected by human .    hence , we argue that , to enable location - independent recognition , we should remove those dominant environmental information and only transform the csi of dynamic paths into images .",
    "to deal with location dependency , we propose a method based on svd to remove the background energy .    in @xcite ,",
    "wei et al .",
    "consider the correlation between csi streams and point out the fact that any effects to signals would be presented across csi streams , inspiring us to apply svd on csi . in image processing techniques",
    ", svd is an attractive algebraic transformation used to manipulate an image in two distinctive sub - spaces , i.e. , data spaces and noise spaces .",
    "if we treat the csi profile as a matrix @xmath3 of dimension @xmath14 ( denoted as @xmath15 ) , after applying svd , @xmath3 is factorized into three matrices , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a @xmath19 orthogonal matrix , @xmath17 is a @xmath20 orthogonal matrix , and @xmath21 is a @xmath22 matrix with the diagonal elements representing the singular values of @xmath3 .",
    "we can formulate low rank approximation of @xmath3 as follows : @xmath23 in which @xmath24 is usually smaller than @xmath15 for compression and @xmath25 means the singular values ( sv ) in decreasing order corresponding to a pair of singular vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "intuitively , this equation shows that @xmath3 is a sum of different bases with its importance score for approximating the original @xmath3 .",
    "after decomposition , we remove the dominant background energy by setting the first singular value to zero for each image .",
    "we illustrate our design rationale via the example shown in figure [ fig : svd_example ] .",
    "we can observe from the figure that if we set all sv in @xmath21 to zero except for the largest one , denoted by @xmath28 , and reconstruct the channel information by @xmath29 , then , the reconstructed channel @xmath30 would be similar to the csi recorded in the quite environment .",
    "this example shows that the largest sv packs most of energy corresponding to the static paths .",
    "therefore , we set the largest sv to zero so that the background can be mostly removed and the reconstructed channel @xmath31 preserves only the human action part .",
    "we illustrate how the svd - based background removal method improves the performance by the examples shown in figure [ fig : beforeafter ] . in this experiment",
    ", the subject performs the same action ( pick up box ) in two different rooms . before svd",
    "is applied , even when the same action is performed , the power distributions of the whole csi captured in two locations differ due to distinct static paths in different rooms , making the models trained in one place fail to recognize actions recorded in other places . however , after removing the largest sv , as shown in the right ones in figure [ fig : beforeafter ] , the textures of the remaining part from two different rooms resemble each other .",
    "in this section , we describe the overall flow of the proposed framework , from collecting csi , pre - processing , extracting features to training the classifier , as shown in figure [ fig : system ] .",
    "we use macbook pro 2014 or asus u80v with intel 5300 nic as tx and fujitsu sh560 with intel 5300 nic as rx , each having two antennas . with _ n~tx~ _ = 2 , _ n~rx~",
    "_ = 2 , we have 2 @xmath32 2 = 4 _ tx - rx _ pairs , each generating a set of csi with dimension 30 ( sub - carriers ) @xmath32 _ t _ ( samples ) .",
    "we then process these four sets of csi separately and investigate whether early or late fusion yields better performance .      due to interference caused by other devices in the same wi - fi channel ,",
    "packets received are not evenly distributed in time .",
    "thus , we linearly interpolate raw csi to 1000 samples / second .",
    "we then apply 5th - order butterworth filter with cutoff frequency 50hz to remove high - frequency noise . and since power distributions of different sub - carriers vary , we normalize each sub - carrier by subtracting the average of a moving - window , width set as 300ms , from each sample .",
    "we will later investigate , via experiments , the two settings : ( 1 ) apply svd on each set of csi with dimension @xmath33 separately , and ( 2 ) apply svd on all the csi streams with dimension @xmath34 , and explore which option performs better .",
    "after transforming a set of csi into an image of specific size , we experiment with gabor and bow - sift on it . though deep features are potentially more powerful , due to the scarcity of current data we will not address it in our work .",
    "a gabor filter is defined by a plane wave multiplied by a gaussian function . by setting different scales and orientations , a set of filters",
    "are obtained .",
    "these filters are convoluted with a transformed image . when a local patch resembles the filter ,",
    "a high response will be obtained .",
    "finally , a response map is produced , of which we then take two statistics , mean and standard deviation .",
    "we set _ # scale _ , _ # orientation _ and size of the gabor filters to 8 , 6 and 15 respectively , which usually produce better accuracy from our measurements .",
    "hence , the dimension of our final gabor feature is 8 @xmath32 6 @xmath32 2 = 96 .",
    "sift ( scale invariant feature transform ) seeks to transform an image into a collection of keypoints , each described by a feature vector invariant to illumination , translation , rotation and scaling .",
    "we take all feature vectors of the training images from a _ tx - rx _ pair and perform k - means clustering to find 48 centroids .",
    "bow - sift feature is then generated by quantizing vectors of an image to the nearest centroid , producing a histogram of dimension 48 .",
    "thus , in testing phase , we quantize the feature vectors of the input image into centroids found during training and feed the produced 48-dimension feature into the trained classifier .      for each of the four _ tx - rx _ pairs , we obtain a feature vector .",
    "we investigate fusing them before or after training linear svm classifiers .",
    "we concatenate four features from four _ tx - rx _ pairs into a new feature .",
    "then , we train a single classifier and take action with the highest probability as the predicted result .      instead of concatenating four feature vectors and training a single classifier",
    ", we train one for each pair , so there would be four classifiers . given a testing instance , probability of each action",
    "is obtained , rendering four probability vectors of length # _ action _ ( seven in our case ) . summing these four vectors",
    ", we take action with the highest probability as the predicted result .",
    "in this section , we present our experimental results on action recognition and person identification .",
    "dataset a is collected in a seminar room , as shown in figure [ fig : seminar_room ] , for verifying if our method could recognize actions as well as locations .",
    "we define seven actions : _ box , clap , wave hand , kick , quick squat , jump , stand still _ and six locations _ a , b , c , d , e , f_. a single subject performs each action 10 times on each location , so in total we have 7 @xmath32 6 @xmath32 10 = 420 data .",
    "dataset b is collected to compare with vision - based methods on video action recognition , and thus we define actions the same as the benchmark dataset , kth @xcite .",
    "these actions include : _ box , clap , wave hand , walk , jog , run , stand still_. two subjects are asked to perform each action 10 times and in total we have 2 @xmath32 7 @xmath32 10 = 140 data .",
    "all actions are performed in a 5-second period , each generating four sets of csi with dimension 30 @xmath32 5000 ( interpolated to 1000 samples / second ) .",
    "we then transform them into four images of size 576 @xmath32 432 .",
    "we evaluate the performance using 10-fold cross validation .",
    "first , we conduct experiments on dataset a with late - fusion scheme ( details will be discussed in table [ tab : late - early ] ) , as cross - validation accuracy shown in table [ tab : dataseta ] .",
    "we could verify that viewing csi as texture is feasible and gabor filters , particularly suitable for texture recognition , perform better .",
    "hence , following experiments are primarily based on gabor .",
    ".accuracy of gabor and bof - sift on dataset a. [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : size ]        we collect our dataset in five seminar rooms , such as the two shown in figure [ fig : r539_r540_r542 ] , to verify if our method could recognize actions from different places .",
    "we define six actions : _ stand still _ , _ walk _ , _ run _ , _ pick up box _",
    ", _ golf swing _ , and _ jump_. a single",
    "subject performs each action 20 times so in total we have 120 traces for each room .",
    "all actions are performed in a 5-second period , each generating four sets of csi with dimension @xmath35 and roughly more than 2000 samples / sec .",
    "we then transform them into four images of size @xmath36 .",
    "for each room , we evaluate the performance by 10-fold cross validation , as accuracy shown in table [ tab : one_room ] .",
    "we experiment on four settings , in which svd@xmath37-@xmath38svm means applying svd on @xmath37 sub - carriers and training @xmath38 svm classifiers .",
    "if we do not apply svd on csi , performance debases significantly due to noises and background interference , showing that our method can also remove noises . with our setting and de - noise strategy ,",
    "the performance of 10-fold cross validation in one room is remarkably better than those without location dependency removal method .",
    "then , we also conduct cross room experiments with one room being testing data and others being training data , as shown in table [ tab : cross_room ] . the results of none pre - processing set are not even better than random guess , while those applying svd achieve a promising accuracy . moreover",
    ", we can observe that svd120 outperforms svd30 in average performance , inferring that 120 sub - carriers considered together capture more human action information .",
    "however , the results show that both fusion schemes produce similar performance .",
    "finally , we would like to explore whether the amount of training data affects the accuracy .",
    "since the svd120 - 1svm obtains the better average performance in the previous experiment , we only list the results using svd120 - 1svm in table [ tab : more_data ] .",
    "the results among all rooms show tendency that when more training data are involved , the higher accuracy may be achieved , implying the model is improved by investigating more data .",
    "we collect a dataset including ten people , with seven males and three females , age ranging from 20 to 27 . for each person , we record aforementioned six actions ten times in one seminar room .",
    "all actions are also performed in a 5-second period , and the remaining settings are the same as those in action recognition .      as shown in table [",
    "tab : id ] , we only adopt ten walks of each person , and train svm classifiers to identify which person is walking .",
    "the result shown in the first row indicates that different people would present his or her own walking style , thus showing promising accuracy .    in the next two blocks of experiments ,",
    "we investigate if different outfits would confuse the classifier .",
    "the tag `` clothes '' means data recorded in user wearing t - shirt , long - sleeve t - shirt , cotton suit or coat , while the tag `` bags '' means data recorded in user with side bag or backpack . in the mixing data part ,",
    "the classifiers are trained with the same labels of ten people , meaning that data of one person are mixed with different outfits .",
    "we can see that the accuracy just degrades slightly , implying that the classifier could still recognize the person with different outfits . and in the last row of avatars part , for example , the classifiers are trained with labels of fifteen people , meaning that one person among the ten - people group are extended as six persons with six different outfis .",
    "the unacceptable performance confirms that if we assume different outfits as different people , the classifier would be confused because they are literally the same person .",
    "in the previous sections , we only consider if environments could affect the performance ; thus , we propose a svd - based method to resolve environment dynamics . in this section",
    ", we would like to investigate if distances , sampling rates , outfits matter .",
    "we set the predefined six actions , each action ten times , so in total 60 data as a set .",
    "as shown in table [ tab : cross_factors ] , the _ original _ row means the set is recorded in distance 0 meter ( target to tx - rx ) , sampling rate 2400 samples / sec , t - shirt as outfit . in _ environments mixed _",
    "row , data are mixed with 5 different rooms mentioned in the section  [ sec : exp ] ; in the _ distances mixed _ row , data are mixed with 0 meter , 2 meters , 4 meters and 6 meters ; in _ sampling rates mixed _ row ,",
    "data are mixed with 400 samples / sec , 800 samples / sec , 1200 samples / sec and 2400 samples / sec ; finally in _ outfits mixed _ row , data are mixed with t - shirt , long - sleeve t - shirt , cotton suit and coat .",
    "each row contains an action set .",
    "the accuracy is evaluated by 10-fold cross validation with the propose location dependency removal method .",
    "the results show that different distances would debate the accuracy slightly while other factors would not .",
    "we consider that even our method removes the environment information , data recorded in various distances would have different human - body - reflected signal power . thus",
    ", proper pre - processing to normalize the power distribution may be worth investigated in the future if we want to recognize data from different distances .    as for identification , however , we do not conduct experiments of different environments , distances and sampling rates as we did on action recognition . besides , some open issues could be further discussed , such as detecting a person outside the group , recognizing even a larger group of people , evaluating if diverse age would affect , and on - line learning the classifier adapting to the change in the outfit and moving patterns of a person .",
    "in this paper , we provide an overview on human action recognition along with user identification using wi - fi , and clearly differentiate our work with other related researches .",
    "we observe the resemblance of csi to texture and apply vision - based methods on images transformed from csi . with this brand new angle",
    ", we develop a framework that achieves an accuracy above 85% identifying the seven predefined actions . though environment dependency is a challenging issue , which lowers the performance when the user deviates from the training locations too much , we propose a location dependency removal method based on svd to remove the environment information embedded in csi .",
    "thus , actions recorded in different locations could still be recognized by the trained classifiers .",
    "our experimental results show that the svd - based solution achieves an accuracy above 90% classifying the six predefined actions on cross - environment action recognition .    finally , we discuss about the feasibility of our methods applied on identification .",
