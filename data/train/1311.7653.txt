    "this paper establishes some scenarios where the 2d muskat problem produces splash singularities ; that is to say , we prove that a free boundary evolving by the muskat problem collapses at a single point while the interface prevails smooth .",
    "the situation is stable ; we show geometries for initial data where the rayleigh - taylor condition holds .",
    "the singularities we construct are `` splash '' singularities in which the interface self - intersects at a single point at the time of breakdown @xmath2 as in fig .",
    "our previous papers @xcite and @xcite showed the existence of a splash singularity for the water wave problem .",
    "the strategy there is to start with a  splash \" singularity at the time @xmath2 then solve water wave equation backwards in time .",
    "this yields a solution to the water wave equation in a time interval @xmath3 $ ] that is well behaved at any time @xmath4 but exhibits a splash at time @xmath2 . in our present setting , we can not use that strategy because the muskat problem in the stable regime is parabolic and therefore can not be solved backwards in time .",
    "the importance of this issue is made clear by the fact that water waves can form a  splat \" singularity @xcite whereas muskat solution can not @xcite .",
    "( a  splat \" occurs when , at the time of breakdown , the interface self - intersects along an arc ) . on the other hand ,",
    "an analysis of the muskat problem has in common with our previous work on the water waves a conformal map to the  tilde domain \" , see @xcite .",
    "recall the muskat problem , which describes the evolution of two fluids of different nature in porous media .",
    "both fluids are assumed to be immiscible and incompressible , been the most common example for applications the dynamics of water and oil @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the two fluids occupy the connected open set @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the characteristics of the fluids are their constant densities and viscosities . then the step functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the density and viscosity respectively on the media given by : @xmath9 @xmath10 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 constant values .",
    "the main concern is about the dynamics of the common free boundary @xmath17 , which is given by using the experimental darcy s law : @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the incompressible velocity @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the scalar pressure . above , the permeability of the media and the gravity constant are set equal to one without loss of generality .",
    "the muskat problem is a long standing matter @xcite of recognized importance , specially because of its analogies with the evolutions of fluids in hele - shaw cells . in that setting",
    "the fluids are confined inside two closely parallel flat surfaces in such a way that the dynamics is essentially bidimensional .",
    "the hele - shaw evolution law is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is distance among the surfaces .",
    "therefore , it is possible to observe that for both different scenarios comparable phenomena and properties hold @xcite .",
    "a main feature of the problem is the appearance of instabilities , which have been shown in different situations @xcite,@xcite . from a contour dynamics point of view",
    ", the system of equations for the free boundary is essentially ill - possed from a hadamard point of view @xcite,@xcite .",
    "although taking into account surface tension effects the system becomes well - possed @xcite@xcite , still it shows fingering @xcite and exponential growing modes @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the muskat problem is well - possed in stable regimes without surface tension @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this situation is reached for the problem when the difference of the gradient pressure jump at the free interface is positive @xcite .",
    "then it is said that the rayleigh - taylor condition holds .",
    "in such case , linearizing the contour equation it is possible to get the following @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the free boundary ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the rayleigh - taylor constant and the operator @xmath28 is the square root of the negative laplacian .",
    "then , the fact that @xmath29 turns the muskat problem into a parabolic system at the linear level .",
    "this fact has been used to prove global in time regularity and instant analyticity for small initial data in different situations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    for the case of equal viscosities ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the rayleigh - taylor condition holds when the more dense fluid lies below the interface and the less dense fluid lies above it @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the regime is stable if the free boundary @xmath31 is represented by the graph of a function @xmath32 . in particular , it is possible to get a decay of the @xmath33 norm @xcite as follows : @xmath34 for @xmath35 and with @xmath36 @xmath37 it is easy to check that above formulas provide the same rate of decay than equation for @xmath38 at the linear level . on the other hand , the @xmath39 norm evolution allows to control half derivative for @xmath38 due to the identity @xmath40 meanwhile at the nonlinear level the following equality @xmath41 does not give a chance of gaining any regularity @xcite .",
    "the case of a drop on a solid substrate in porous media have been studied in @xcite .",
    "this case considers the dynamics of one fluid , also known as the one - phase muskat problem .",
    "the authors show local well - posedness on the problem with estimates independent of the contact angle .    in @xcite it is shown solutions of the muskat equation for initial smooth stable graphs with precise geometries which enter in unstable regime becoming non - graph in finite time .",
    "the pattern is far from trivial and recently it has been shown to be richer for the inhomogeneous and confined problems ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in particular the significance of a turnover ( non - graph scenario ) is that the rayleigh - taylor condition breaks down .",
    "furthermore , @xcite there exist smooth initial data in the stable regime for the muskat problem such that the solutions turn to the unstable regime and later the regularity breaks down .",
    "therefore global - existence is false for some large initial data in the stable regime as the time evolution solutions develop singularities .    in this paper we show that the muskat problem can develop singularities in stable regimes .",
    "the singularity is a splash , where for the free boundary given by @xmath42 there exist a blow - up time @xmath43 and a point @xmath44 such that @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "in particular the curve is regular , and satisfies the chord - arc condition up to the time @xmath47 : @xmath48    free boundary incompressible fluid equations can develop splash singularities .",
    "this scenario have been shown for the incompressible euler equations in the water waves form @xcite,@xcite which considers the evolution of a free boundary given by air , with density 0 , and water , with density 1 , and irrotational velocity .",
    "this type of singularities can also be shown for the case with vorticity @xcite .",
    "although for the case of two incompressible fluids with positive densities , this setting has been recently ruled out @xcite . for muskat this type of singularities does not also hold in the case in which @xmath30 and @xmath49 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we show finite time splash singularities with @xmath50 : @xmath51 considering the one fluid dynamics with @xmath6 a dry region .",
    "we also yield some geometries for the interface where the rayleigh - taylor condition is satisfied , getting rid of unstable situations .",
    "the main theorem of the paper is the following :    [ splashvacuum ] there exist an open set of curves @xmath52 , satisfying the chord - arc and rayleigh - taylor condition , such that for any @xmath53 the solution of muskat ( [ darcyin],[incomin],[interdef],[rmin ] ) with @xmath54 violates the chord - arc condition at a finite time @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , this holds in such a way that @xmath56 with @xmath57 . at the time @xmath47 the muskat system ( [ darcyin],[incomin],[interdef],[rmin ] ) breaks down .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we show the proof of above result splitting it in several sections . in section 2",
    "we construct a family of curves @xmath58 for which there is a unique self - intersection point @xmath59 where @xmath60 with @xmath57 and @xmath61 .",
    "plugging these curves in darcy s law , we get that the rayleigh - taylor condition holds .",
    "furthermore , the velocity indicates that the self - intersection point is going to disappear going backward in time .",
    "a more general scenario can be found in section [ generales ] . in section 3",
    "we show how to make sense the problem with a self - intersecting point , transforming the muskat problem into a new contour dynamics equation we call @xmath62(muskat ) . up to the time of the splash we can recover muskat from @xmath62(muskat ) , but at the time of splash @xmath62(muskat ) makes sense and it is possible to go further in time . in section 4",
    "we prove local existence of the @xmath62(muskat ) system . in section 5",
    "we show a stability result for @xmath62(muskat ) .",
    "finally , in section 6 we show how the family of curves @xmath63 together with the existence and stability for @xmath62(muskat ) allow us to conclude the proof of theorem [ splashvacuum ] .",
    "in this section we show that there exits a family of splash curves such that the rayleigh - taylor condition hold and with velocities which separate the splash point running backward - in - time .",
    "first we use hopf s lemma to achieve the rayleigh - taylor condition . taking divergence in darcy s law we have @xmath64 for any @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , the continuity of the pressure on the free boundary @xcite and the fact that @xmath66 for any @xmath67 in the interior of @xmath6 allow us to get @xmath68 on the other hand we consider velocities with mean zero vorticity @xmath69 which provides @xmath70 and finite energy settings . approaching to infinity in @xmath5 yields @xmath71 and therefore darcy s law gives @xmath72 it is possible to find that @xmath73 when @xmath74 and to conclude that the pressure is positive in @xmath5 by the maximum principle for harmonic functions .",
    "in this situation we can apply hopf s lemma to obtain that @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the normal vector pointing out the domain @xmath5 .",
    "next we deal with curves @xmath63 with a splash point @xmath60 for @xmath57 where @xmath77 we show that this configuration provides a sign for the velocity at @xmath59 . taking the trace of darcy s law to the surface and multiplying by @xmath78 we have",
    "that @xmath79 thanks to our choice of the splash curve it must be satisfied @xmath80 where again we have used hopf s lemma .",
    "it is clear that implies that the velocity separates the splash point backwards in time .    in figure 1",
    "we give a graphic sketch of the kind of splash singularities we are considering .",
    "theses splash curves yield the simplest scenario we can consider . in section [ generales ]",
    "we show the existence of different geometries that give rise to a splash singularity for the one - phase muskat problem .",
    "this section is devoted to transform the system into a new contour evolution equation where we handle the splash singularity .",
    "we consider solutions of muskat satisfying ( [ darcyin],[incomin],[interdef],[rmin ] ) for regular @xmath81 satisfying the chord - arc condition . taking limit as @xmath82 from @xmath5 we find @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 stands for the birkhoff - rott integral , which is given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the amplitude of the vorticity concentrated on the free boundary : @xmath88 by approaching to the contour in darcy s law and taking the dot product with @xmath89 it is easy to relate the amplitude of the vorticity and the free boundary by an elliptic implicit equation : @xmath90 we have the dynamics given by the following contour equation @xmath91 where @xmath92 represents reparameterization freedom .",
    "see @xcite for a detail derivation of the system .    in a periodic setting in the @xmath93 direction",
    ", we will transform the system with the conformal map : @xmath94 above , the branch of the square root is chosen in such a way that crosses the self - intersecting point of the @xmath63 curve from before section .",
    "therefore @xmath95 becomes a one - to - one curve .",
    "we then consider by this new transformation the curve @xmath96 .",
    "this provides easily @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath99 for the potential @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) we define in the tilde domain @xmath102 . then @xmath103 taking limit we find @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",
    "it yields @xmath106 where @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the @xmath110 identity matrix .",
    "in other words @xmath111    next we consider the velocity @xmath112 defined on the whole space by @xmath113 where @xmath114 in a distributional sense .",
    "approaching to the free boundary it is possible to obtain @xmath115 in order to close the system we integrate darcy s law to find @xmath116 due to the continuity of the pressure at the free boundary and the vacuum state .",

    "identities and give @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "this provides @xmath124 we end up with a contour equation given by ( [ omegatilde],[ecbr],[ctilde ] ) .",
    "finally we will find the rayleigh - taylor condition in terms of @xmath125 .",

    "we suppress the time variable and the tilde in the equation .",

    "these a priori estimates will lead to a local existence result for the contour equation in the tilde domain .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite in order to obtain @xmath146 as a similar approach can be made .",

    "however the one - phase muskat problem can develop this kind of point - wise collapse for more geometries . in order to check that we proceed as follows .",
    "let @xmath379 be a splash curve with @xmath380 such that @xmath381 and @xmath382 for every @xmath383 . to consider a different situation than in section 2",
    ", we also assume that @xmath384 .",
    "we make the following distinction between @xmath385 and @xmath386 : there exist a neighborhood @xmath387 of @xmath385 and a neighborhood @xmath388 of @xmath386 such that , if @xmath389 for @xmath390 and @xmath391 , then @xmath392 . roughly speaking",
    ", we just mean that @xmath393 is the upper splash point and @xmath394 is the lower splash point .",
    "let us analyze the normal velocity at @xmath386 and @xmath385 .",
    "for @xmath386 we have @xmath395 where @xmath396 . as in section [ initialdata ] , hopf s lemma yields @xmath397 and we consider @xmath398 on the other hand , we have @xmath399 with @xmath400 and @xmath401 then the sign of @xmath402 is bad for our purpose .",
    "however we can notice that @xmath403 and therefore @xmath404 the last inequality is enough to show that the velocity separates the splash points backward in time .",
    "unfortunately this is not enough to assure that we can produce a splash singularity by using the previous analysis .",
    "it is possible to find @xmath405 negative .",
    "then the solution would cross the branch of @xmath62 backward in time .",
    "this is a mere technical problem that we can solve as follow .",
    "let s define a velocity @xmath406 a density @xmath407 and a viscosity @xmath408 therefore @xmath409 thus we have that @xmath410 satisfies @xmath411 and in a similar manner it is easy to get @xmath412 on the other hand @xmath413 where we consider @xmath414 then , by using @xmath415 , @xmath410 , @xmath416 and @xmath417 , we can write our muskat problem as the system @xmath418 with the boundary condition @xmath419    in this new system we find the following : if @xmath379 is a splash curve such that @xmath381 then @xmath420 and again we can invoke hopf s lemma to obtain that @xmath421 then , the velocity separates the splash point and @xmath422 points in the opposite direction to @xmath423 .",
