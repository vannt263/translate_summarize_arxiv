    "magnetostriction is essentally a nonlinear phenomenon , which accounts for the change of dimension of a magnetic material under applied magnetic fields .",
    "however , most of the applications of this phenomenon consider small amplitude fields and consequently exploit only their linear properties , as is the case of electromagnetic - acoustic transducers .",
    "the consideration of nonlinearities in the description of this process lead to the discovery of new properties , such as the parametric wave phase conjugation ( wpc ) , a phenomena which is actually an active field of research with promising applications into acoustic microscopy @xcite or harmonic imaging @xcite .",
    "a review on wpc theory and methods can be found in brysev98 .",
    "there is also increasing interest in the developement of magnetostrictive transducers working at high powers , where nonlinear effects are not negligible .",
    "the advances in this field come in paralel with the search of novel magnetic materials with high magnetostriction values .    on the other side ,",
    "parametric phenomena in different fields of nonlinear science share many common features , such as bistability , self - pulsations and chaos among others .",
    "is precisely this analogy that motivates our search for complex dynamical phenomena in parametrically driven magnetoacoustic systems .",
    "different models have been proposed for the description of magnetoacoustic interaction in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "also , many experimental progress in this field has been achieved , and the main parameters involved in the process have been determined @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analize the dynamical behaviour of this system in the presence of magnetic nonlinearity .",
    "it is shown that a cubic magnetic nonlinearity is responsible for the appearance of new effects not reported before in this system , such as self - pulsing dynamics and spiking behaviour , related to the existence of homoclinic bifurcations",
    "the physical system considered in this paper consists in a electric @xmath0 circuit , driven by an external ac source at frequency @xmath1 and variable amplitude @xmath2 . the inductance coil , with density of turns @xmath3 , transverse section @xmath4 and length @xmath5 contains a ferromagnetic ceramic material which acts as an acoustical resonator and is the origin of nonlinearities in the system when the driving @xmath2 is high enough .",
    "a theoretical model for this system has been derived in the resonant case in @xcite .",
    "we review here the details of the derivation for convenience .",
    "the equation for the circuit is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 , and @xmath10 depends nonlinearly on the magnetic fields .",
    "we consider two effects that introduce the nonlinearities in the problem .",
    "the first source of nonlinearity results from magnetoacoustic interaction , which appears via phonon - magnon proccesses . in the case of parametric magnetostriction ceramics ,",
    "the generation of ultrasound takes place at half of the frequency of the driving .",
    "this process is represented , in general , by a lagrangian density term in the form @xmath11,@xcite where @xmath12 is the acoustic displacement component in the direction @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) and @xmath15 has in general tensor character .",
    "the total magnetic induction @xmath16 acting along the axis of the material is the result of three contributions : a static field @xmath17 produced , e.g. by a permanent magnet surrounding the active ceramic material or a coil carrying a stationary current , an alternating field @xmath18 induced by the ac current in the circuit , and finally a field produced by material deformations @xmath19 , which results from the magnetoacoustic interaction . from the lagrangian density it follows that , in the case of longitudinal waves propagating in the @xmath20 axis ( @xmath21 , the acousto - induced magnetic field has the form@xmath22where @xmath23 is the coefficient of coupling between the active medium of volume @xmath24 and the pump source .",
    "thus , the effective magnetic induction takes the form@xmath25where we assume that the relation @xmath26 holds .",
    "alternatively , @xmath16 given by ( [ h ] ) can be considered as a nonlinear pumping field @xcite .",
    "note that the appearance of the subharmonic field saturates the magnetic field value , and modifies the effective pumping .",
    "a second source of nonlinearity is typical of ferromagnetic materials .",
    "we assume that , for weak saturation , the scalar nonlinear relation between the magnetic field and the magnetic induction , @xmath27 , can be written , following @xcite , as    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is linear the permeability of the material and @xmath30 the third order magnetic susceptibility , which in turn depends on the frequency .    applying the faraday law under the previous assumptions , considering only resonant terms oscillating at the frequency of the driving @xmath1 , and neglecting terms higher than quadratic in @xmath31 and @xmath19",
    ", we get @xmath32where @xmath33 is the electrical current in the circuit , @xmath34 is the inductance and @xmath35 in terms of the charge in the capacitor , and taking into account that @xmath36 and that @xmath37 is the density of turns , the circuit equation takes the form@xmath38where the last two terms represent the nonlinearities related magnetoelastic interaction and magnetic nonlinearity respectively .    let us consider now the evolution of the acoustic wave . considering the current induced magnetic field @xmath31 as the main source term , we find preobrazhensky93 @xmath39where @xmath40 is the propagation velocity of sound in the material . here the effect of the acousto - induced magnetic field ( quadratic in the small coupling constant @xmath15 ) has been neglected .",
    "however , we have checked that the consideration of this small term do not imply qualitative changes in the results reported below .",
    "we consider solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ charge ] ) and ( [ sound ] ) in the form of quasi - harmonic waves , i.e. , whose amplitudes are slowly varying in time . in this case",

    "the slow amplitudes obey the evolution equations    [ eqsqu ] @xmath48where @xmath49 , and @xmath50and @xmath51 represent the electric and acoustic losses respectively .",
    "the last parameter is introduced phenomenologically , and take into account the losses due mainly to radiation from the boundaries .",
    "the coefficients of the nonlinear terms are defined as    @xmath52    equations ( [ eqsqu ] ) are the model considered in @xcite with some corrections .",
    "this system can be further simplified using the normalizations @xmath53which leads to the model @xmath54where @xmath55 is the ratio between losses , @xmath56 is a dimensionless time and@xmath57remains as the single parameter of nonlinearity , with @xmath58 . due to the number of parameters involved in @xmath59",

    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ eqs2 ] ) also possess the symmetry @xmath60 .",
    "equations ( [ eqs2 ] ) possess two kinds of stationary solutions . for small pump values ,",
    "the acoustic subharmonic field is absent , and the homogeneous trivial solution is readily found as@xmath61for higher values of the pump , the trivial solution becomes unstable and the acoustic subharmonic field is switched - on .",
    "the corresponding values of the amplitudes are given by @xmath62and the bifurcation occurs at a critical ( threshold ) pump given by @xmath63which is independent of the value of the nonlinearity coefficient @xmath59 .    from ( [ inthom ] )",
    "it also follows that the acoustic field shows bistability , i.e. , both solutions coexist for pump values between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 corresponds to the turning point of the solution and is given by @xmath67    we consider next the stability of the homogeneous solutions ( [ inthom ] ) , by means of the well known linear stability analysis technique . substituting in eqs .",

    "the instability of the solution is determined by the existence of positive real parts of the roots @xmath72 of the fourth - order characteristic polynomial@xmath73where@xmath74with @xmath75 given by eq .",
    "( [ inthom ] ) .",
    "since we are interested in the existence of dynamical behaviour , we search for a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues , which denote the occurrence of a hopf ( oscillatory ) instability . following the hurwitz criterion ( see , e.g. haken83 ) ,",
    "the condition for hopf instability @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 or@xmath78    the frequency of the oscillations at the bifurcation point , given by the imaginary part of the eigenvalue , is found by substituting @xmath79 in the polynomial . in terms of the acoustic intensity given by the solutions of ( [ inthopf ] ) the frequency reads @xmath80    in fig.1 the domain of existence of hopf bifurcations ( the solutions of eq .",

    ", the analysis of the previous section ( see also fig . 1 , line @xmath89 ) shows that the solutions display temporal dynamics when the nonlinearity coefficient take values in the range @xmath90     and @xmath91 .",

    "( [ inthom ] ) , and the existence of the backward ( inverted ) hopf bifurcation of the upper branch predicted by the theory of the previous section is observed at @xmath93 .",
    "dynamical states exist for pump values below this critical point ( see also fig .",
    "1 ) . for higher pump values ,",
    "the solution is stationary , and the dynamics decay to a fixed point . the upper and lower branches with open circles in fig . 2 correspond to maximum and minimum values of ultrasonic amplitudes in the oscillating regime .",
    "numerics also show the switch  off of the ultrasonic field",
    "when pump is decreased down to a given critical value@xmath94  this means that , despite bistability , the trivial ( zero ) solution is a globally attracting solution , which have important consequences on the dynamics of the system .",
    "similar diagrams are obtained for any value of @xmath59 in the range given above . for small values of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath59 ,",
    "the solutions are quasi - harmonic in time regardless the pump value .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath59 close to limiting value @xmath95 required for the existence of dynamical states , the solutions show a qualitatively different temporal behaviour , not predicted by the linear stability analysis which in fact is valid only near the bifurcation point .",

    "2 ) approaches the lower branch of the stationary solutions ( short - dashed line in fig .",
    "2 ) , which as follows from the linear stability analysis corresponds to a saddle point .",

    "a model of parametric generation of ultrasound in a ferromagnetic material has been considered , and its stability analyzed , revealing the existence of a hopf bifurcation leading to self  pulsing dynamics . for selected values of the decay rates and the nonlinearity parameter , the system also show a saddle  loop bifurcation which results in a spiking regime in the emitted ultrasound , where the frequency can take arbitrary low frequencies or firing rates .",
