    "a problem of practical interest is therefore that of coupling the harmonic power outside . a possibility is offered by the use of an external radiator , provided by an undulator with the same characteristics of the intracavity magnet .",
    "the e - b extracted from the cavity and injected inside the radiator produces the effects shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : eq7 ] ) , which holds in the case of small signal low gain regime .",

    "the gain of each eigenmode is not zero at 0 cavity detuning ( the maximum gain is given by the condition @xmath39 ) .",
    "equation ( 7 ) can be used to model the saturation provided that the gain terms be replaced by the corresponding gain saturated forms ( see appendix for further details ) .",
    "it should be stressed that eq .",
    "( 7 ) assumes that the mode growth occurs around the maximum of the electron bunch distribution and indeed the quadratic terms in @xmath40 is due to an expansion of the current profile up to the lowest order in the longitudinal coordinate .",
    "this is also compatible with the assumption that the slippage is small compared to the bunch length and , therefore , that the mode longitudinal extension cover a limited portion of the electron bunch .",
    "the small slippage approximation allows the possibility of studying the field evolution around the center of the electron packet .",
    "other sm like forms may grow in correspondence of other positions inside the e - bunch , after saturation around the maximum of the current has occurred .",
    "the fundamental mode , namely that corresponding to the lowest order eigenmode of eq . ( [ eq : eq7 ] ) , has the largest gain and is the more likely to reach saturation , it has a gaussian shape , having the width reported in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ec.6 ] ) ( see appendix ) .",
    "we must however emphasize that during the evolution the optical pulse tends to move towards the front end of the electron bunch , this determines a faster saturation of the `` active - medium '' represented by this portion of the bunch .",
    "it should now be kept in mind that the lowest order sm is that reaching the saturation , while the others die , before that the system approaches the equilibrium .",
    "the survival of only one mode ensures the stability , unless other factors like beam jitter or cavity length fluctuations are present . as already remarked the sm equation ( 7 )",
    "is appropriate for the description of the laser evolution around the maximum of the electron current , which is the center of the optical packet . on the other side , in view of the fact that the radiation explores only a small portion of the electron bunch during its passage inside the undulator , other sm - like structure may develop if sufficient gain is available around different regions of the electron packet .",
    "they are ruled by equations analogous to those given in ( 7 ) , apart from a gain modulation determined by the current profile . if we sample the electron bunch with the number of peaks predicted by eq .",
    "( 6 ) , we obtain ( numerically ) what has been described in the previous parts of the paper , namely the formation of narrow subpeaks , which agrees ( at least in number ) with the fluctuating spikes of the sase regime .",
    "it should also be noted that they have a spatial width of the same order of the coherence length .",
    "this is what we have found numerically using prometeo code and an attempt of theoretical justification is provided in the appendix .",
    "the previous description is certainly not sufficient to explain the formation of the deep saturated comb like structure in oscillators and further remarks are in order , mainly in connection with the packet shortening .",
    "as in conventional laser devices saturation is driven by a decrease of the gain due to the intra - cavity intensity through a factor of the type          where @xmath43 are the linear and the second order non - linear refractive indices characterizing the fel medium .",
    "this effect produces a shift in the instantaneous phase of the pulse which in turns determines a frequency shift , leading to a frequency chirping inducing a compression of the pulse .",
    "the mechanism is slightly more complex than the effect on single pulses propagating in selfoc fibers due to the appearance of multiple peaks , which is simply due to the finite size of the coherence length , which , in the case of our simulations , is much shorter than the electron bunch length .",
    "an insightful analysis on this point can also be found in @xcite .",
    "this is just a qualitative statement , a more detailed study in analytical terms will be presented elsewhere . a further idea of the sub - peak evolution is provided by fig .",

    "we have tried different combinations of the parameters ( gain losses , bunch length  ) and the scaling relations we have hypothesized have been confirmed , along with the fact that the dependence of the sub pulse width on the cavity losses is weak .        it is evident that the previous considerations do not corroborate the suggestions that the saturated comb - spike are associated with high gain spikes , but provide a further independent argument that their duration coincides with the coherence length .",

    "<S> we analyze the behavior of free electron laser ( fel ) oscillators operating in the deep saturated regime and point out the formation of sub - peaks of the optical pulse . </S>",
    "<S> they are very stable configurations , having a width corresponding to a coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on the physical mechanisms underlying their growth and attempt an identification with fel mode locked structures associated with super modes . </S>",
    "<S> their impact on the intra - cavity nonlinear harmonic generation is also discussed along with the possibility of exploiting them as cavity out - coupler . </S>"
