    "intermittency is a prominent phenomenon observed in a large variety of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "the classical examples for intermittent behaviour , the so - called pomeau - manneville types i - iii @xcite , can be found in deterministic systems where upon a certain change of a control parameter a fixed point of the system ( corresponding to a periodic trajectory ) becomes unstable .",
    "one of the characteristic features for the distinction of the different types of intermittency is the statistics of the duration of the quasi - periodic ( laminar ) phases which are irregularly interrupted by chaotic parts of the trajectory .",
    "a fundamentally different type of intermittent behaviour has been observed in coupled chaotic oscillators @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be found in dynamical systems at the stability threshold when a stochastic or chaotic process couples multiplicatively to the system variables .",
    "the term on - off intermittency has been coined for this phenomenon . in systems which exhibit this type of intermittency , there is no sharp transition from an equilibrium quiescent state into an active state but intermittent behaviour occurs for a range of values of the control parameter , and the system has to be characterized by a statistical description .",
    "it resides in a ground ( off ) state during quiescent or laminar periods , which are interrupted by bursts of large scale excursions of the system variables into the on - state . as well as the other types , on - off",
    "intermittency is characterized by fundamental statistical properties of the intermittent process which have been extensively studied during recent years , experimentally as well as theoretically .",
    "a statistical analysis reveals characteristic asymptotic laws that describe the universal behaviour of such systems .",
    "it has been shown that the distribution of the durations @xmath2 of the laminar phases in on - off intermittency follow a characteristic power law with exponent -3/2   @xcite in the vicinity of the instability threshold .",
    "other fundamental scaling laws have been predicted for the distribution of the amplitudes of the bursts @xcite and the power spectrum of the trajectories @xcite .    experimental evidence for on - off intermittent",
    "behaviour has been reported in a number of very different physical systems .",
    "a simple experimental realization can be achieved in coupled oscillator circuits @xcite , other systems described in literature involve a gas discharge plasma @xcite and a ferromagnetic resonance spin wave experiment @xcite . while the fundamental validity of the asymptotic scaling laws is established theoretically , it is not easy to confirm this prediction in the experiments . in the spin wave system @xcite , a power law in the distribution of laminar phases has been reported over just slightly more than one order of magnitude in @xmath2 . in the gas discharge experiment @xcite ,",

    "this system turns out to be particularly well suited for an experimental characterization .",
    "it represents the first spatially extended dissipative system where on - off intermittency has been identified . compared to other reported systems , the ehc experiment shows an additional spatial periodicity of the intermittent bursts where a wavelength selection process is involved .",
    "the access to the control parameters and observation of trajectories is straightforward .",
    "the physical mechanisms are well understood .",
    "many involved material parameters are accessible in independent experiments .",
    "the validity of the asymptotic scaling law for the duration @xmath2 of laminar phases has been confirmed experimentally @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "a modified optical setup is used in order to record pattern wavelengths and amplitudes with high sampling rates .",

    "in addition , a simulation of the linearized dynamic equations is presented .",
    "trajectories obtained in the simulations are compared to the experimental results to test the validity of a linearized treatment of the system dynamics @xcite near the instability threshold .",
    "nematic ehc @xcite represents a standard system of dissipative pattern formation , its fundamental features are well understood today @xcite .",
    "the instability is driven by interactions of an external electric field with electric charges , present as either impurities or dopants in the nematic material .",
    "the experimental geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "[ figehc ] . the ground state with the nematic director ( optic axis ) uniform along an easy axis in the cell plane",

    "an electric field is applied normal to the cell plane .",
    "nematic material with negative dielectric anisotropy @xmath3 is chosen to prevent the splay fredericksz instability . in the electric field , the dielectric torque stabilizes the ground state , but small thermal fluctuations of the director field in connection with an anisotropic conductivity of the nematic generate a periodic space charge modulation in the cell plane .",
    "the interaction of these space charges with the electric field lead to convective flow which in turn generates a destabilizing viscous torque on the director field . above a threshold voltage",
    "u@xmath4 , this torque exceeds the stabilizing dielectric and elastic torques and a periodic pattern of convection rolls and corresponding director deflections is formed . in the simplest case ,",
    "the wave vector of the first instability is along the director ( normal rolls ) .",
    "the roll structure appears in optical transmission as an array of parallel stripes in the cell plane ( fig .",
    "[ figehc ] ) .",
    "electroconvection is conventionally driven with a periodic ac voltage ( to avoid sample degradation in dc fields ) . for the understanding of the mechanism of pattern formation it is essential to note that director and charge fields respond on different time scales to the alternation of the electric field .",
    "the symmetry of the dynamic equations requires that their time dependence with respect to a periodic driving field is antisymmetric .",
    "this is reflected in the existence of two different types of patterns . in the low frequency conduction regime ,",
    "charge relaxation is fast compared to the ac frequency .",

    "figure  [ figthresholds](a ) gives the onset voltage for the first instability , towards normal rolls .",
    "the corresponding wave numbers are shown in figure  [ figthresholds](b ) .    when a stochastic excitation scheme is used where the driving field has no deterministic component ( as e.g. the dichotomous markov process that is considered in this paper ) the system does not exhibit a sharp transition from the quiescent to the convective state upon variation of the control parameter but shows intermittent behaviour .",
    "two different regimes are found which have many features in common with the corresponding conductive and dielectric regimes in the deterministic case . at onset of the instability ,",
    "one of the system s characteristic times ( director or charge relaxation ) becomes comparable to the characteristic time of the noise @xmath7 .",

    "the empirical concept of a threshold voltage has been applied in previous experimental investigations of noise driven ehc @xcite and statistical methods have been applied to test various stability criteria @xcite .",
    "the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath8 of the trajectories of the system variables , which is analytically known @xcite , provides a quantitative measure for the instability threshold , but the crucial problem is the experimental determination of the threshold in a system with limited dynamical range and additive noise .",
    "the statistical analysis of the intermittent trajectories provides an experimental tool to characterize the stability threshold , @xmath9 @xcite .    the observation and quantitative characterization of the dissipative patterns under stochastic excitation",
    "is achieved in this study by exploring the phase grating formed by the spatially periodic deformed director field .",
    "the laser scattering profile resulting from the nematic convection patterns is recorded .",
    "a two - dimensional ( 2d ) detector allows to observe the complete scattering profile of the transmitted laser light and to study the wave vector orientation and wavelength selection process with a sampling rate of 25 s@xmath10 , and alternatively a photo diode positioned at the scattering reflex enables us to record the trajectory of the dominant mode with faster sampling rate and higher intensity resolution .",

    "the glass plates are covered with transparent indium - tin - oxide electrodes ( 5  mm@xmath135  mm ) , they are polyimide coated and antiparallelly rubbed for planar surface alignment .",
    "the temperature of the samples is controlled by a linkam heating stage with an accuracy of 0.1  k. the sample temperature has been set to 32@xmath14c in all experiments .",
    "all relevant material parameters for the simulation of the electrohydrodynamic equations except for some viscosities have been measured in independent experiments @xcite .",
    "the conductivity of the nematic samples differs by about 20% between individual cells , values for a given cell are almost constant in time . in order to prevent long - term trends of the conductivity ,",
    "we reheat the material into the liquid phase between subsequent runs of the experiment , similar procedures have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "all measurements presented in the diagrams of this paper have been performed consecutively with the same cell , in order to obtain quantitatively comparable results for the different statistical investigations .",
    "differences in conductivity between individual cells may lead to variations of the respective thresholds but do not influence the statistical characteristics .    in order to complete the parameter set for the numerical simulations , we fitted the threshold curves and critical wave numbers for deterministic square wave excitation where the experiment yields sharp thresholds towards the first instability . with a fixed parameters set ( table i )",

    "an important feature that facilitates the numerical calculations is that all terms quadratic in the electric field are time independent in the dmp .",
    "an analytical calculation of the sample stability threshold and the critical wave numbers have been performed @xcite . technically , identical realizations of the stochastic process can be reproduced with the computer .",
    "this allows us to use identical noise sequences for experiment and simulations when details of the trajectories of pattern amplitudes are of interest .",
    "_ other stochastic processes _ have been tested in additional experiments .",
    "while the dmp randomizes the phases of a periodic square wave , another stochastic process can be synthesized that randomizes the amplitudes of the square wave but keeps the jumps equidistant .",
    "this randomization of the amplitude can be combined with a random phase of the jumps .",
    "such processes do not complicate the numerical simulations , the electric field is piecewise constant and the equations of motion can be integrated straightforwardly .",
    "it turns out that the statistical properties of the trajectories and the derived scaling laws for these stochastic processes are in full accordance with those for the dmp .",

    "when the sample is in the ground state ( zero electric field ) , only a weak background scattering @xmath25 is observed around the primary beam .",
    "since we are interested in scattering from spatially deformations of the director field , we correct the raw data with a time averaged intensity @xmath26 by @xmath27 .",
    "this correction is marginal since the background signal is in general three orders of magnitude smaller than the amplitude of the scattering reflex at the position of the photo diode .    from the two - dimensional scattering images , wavelengths and orientations of the patterns",

    "a commercial video camera is employed to take 2d scattering images with an acquisition rate of 25 frames per second and 8 bit intensity resolution .",
    "this enables us to study the evolution of the mode spectrum and to access the full wave vector information , although time and intensity resolution are limited .",
