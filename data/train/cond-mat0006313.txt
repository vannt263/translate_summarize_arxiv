    "one century and a half after their discovery , solitons and solitary waves have proven themselves ubiquitous in nature , arising in very many physical applications and leading to very important advances in applied mathematics @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "it is often the case that the properties of solitary waves are known for certain equations , perhaps integrable , that relate to an oversimplified description of different physical systems ; subsequently , one is interested to learn how these properties are modified if terms initially neglected are included as perturbations of the original equation . in most cases , this is a very complicated problem , and shedding light on it usually requires the use of approximate analytical approaches .",
    "one of the most succesful and widely applicable of these approaches is the collective coordinate technique or , rather , the family of collective coordinate techniques @xcite . the main merit of these procedures is the drastic reduction of the number of degrees of freedom involved in the problem , from the infinity of them in the original partial differential equation to the dynamics of a few degrees of freedom , governed by ordinary differential equations .",
    "quite commonly , the reduction is done to a single degree of freedom , which , in general , can be identified with the center of the wave @xmath1 or its velocity @xmath2 , as was first proposed in the mid - seventies @xcite .",
    "this amounts to mapping the motion of solitons or solitary waves to the motion of a pointlike ( perhaps relativistic ) particle with an effective mass @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , this dramatic simplification leads to excellent results for very many systems @xcite .",
    "however , there are perturbations which , when acting on solitary waves , change not only the position of the center of mass of the kink , but also its width , as suggested in @xcite , or even some radiation can appear in the waves , a phenomenon that can yield the whole collective coordinate idea useless as more and more degrees of freedom are excited @xcite .    as we have mentioned above , in 1983",
    "rice @xcite developed a new perturbative method , which he applied to two well - known nonlinear klein - gordon problems , the @xmath0 and the sine - gordon equations @xcite , in order to account for variations of the width of their kink solutions under perturbations . in rice",
    "s approach , the collective coordinates are the kink center @xmath1 and its width @xmath3 .",
    "his results point out that when , in those systems , the kink is subject to `` some perturbations '' ( _ sic _ ) the simple translational motion of the kink center can be coupled to an oscillatory motion of the width of the wave , whose frequency he obtained by means of a variational approach .",
    "interestingly , for the @xmath0 equation this so - called rice frequency , @xmath4 , practically coincides with the frequency @xmath5 of the kink internal mode ( one of the modes of linear excitations around the kink , corresponding to a nonzero eigenvalue in the discrete spectrum , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . on the contrary , for the sine - gordon ( sg ) case , @xmath4 turns out to be within the phonon spectrum and , furthermore , the sg kink does not have an internal mode ( its only eigenvalue in the discrete spectrum is zero , corresponding to a goldstone mode @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , the deformation of the kink width due to the internal mode has been studied extensively in the @xmath0 equation and , among other interesting results , we now know that the internal mode is able to store and transfer the energy in @xmath0 kink - antikink collisions @xcite , in the interaction of @xmath0 kinks with impurities @xcite , or in the case when the @xmath0 kink is subject to a periodic spatially modulated potential @xcite .",
    "this exchange of energy between the internal and the translational modes or among the internal mode and the modes of the impurities explains the resonances that take place in the above perturbed @xmath0 systems .",
    "in view of these results , a question that naturally arises is the possible existence of resonances of the @xmath0 kink when perturbed by external ac forces , a problem that has not been considered so far and that relates to a number of physical contexts .",
    "very recently , we have shown @xcite that a strong resonance arises when the @xmath0 system is subject to an external ac force of the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 close to @xmath8 , while in the case that @xmath9 this resonance is weak and even disappears for an appropriate choice of the initial kink velocity and the parameters of the driving force .",
    "however , the work reported in @xcite contained mostly numerical results and only an intuitive explanation of this striking phenomenon in terms of the collective coordinate equations , and therefore our aim in this paper is to provide a full analytical treatment of those equations ( for the undamped case ) in order to better understand the anomalous resonance phenomenon .",
    "in addition , in doing so we will be already carrying out the same analysis for the sg equation , which may be of interest in order to clarify the question of the existence of an internal quasi - mode for this equation @xcite .",
    "we deal with these issues along the paper according to the following scheme : in the next section we use the so called generalized travelling wave _ ansatz _ ( gtwa ) @xcite to obtain the equations governing the dynamics of the kink center and width ( which is associated to the excitation of the internal mode ) . in sec .",
    "iii we thoroughly analyze those equations in the absence of damping , identifying all the possible resonances and their locations as a function of the equation parameters .",
    "we then focus on the most interesting resonances , namely those at @xmath10 and @xmath5 .",
    "for the damped case we have not been able to solve analytically the equation for @xmath3 , but in sec .",
    "iv we present numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation confirming that the resonance at @xmath8 remains for weak damping , while the resonance at @xmath11 disappears for any damping value .",
    "additionally , in that section we have compared all our analytical results to the numerical simulations , finding an excellent agreement .",
    "finally , in the last section we summarize our results and discuss their implications for other systems , focusing especially on the sg kink dynamics . in an appendix , we prove the equivalence of the gtwa to a different procedure to obtain collective coordinate equations , which uses the momentum and the energy of the system similarly to the classical approach in @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of @xmath0 kinks subject to a periodic force @xmath12 is governed by the equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the damping coefficient , and @xmath15 , @xmath7 and @xmath16 represent the amplitude , the frequency and the phase of the periodic force , respectively .    in order to apply the gtwa , first proposed in @xcite , we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ ecua1 ] ) in the following way : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and the dot represents derivative with respect to time , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the hamiltonian of the system with the corresponding potential , @xmath21 , when @xmath15 and @xmath14 are zero , @xmath22 we now assume that the solution of ( [ ecua6])-([ecua7 ] ) has the form @xmath23 } } , \\end{array } \\label{ecua9}\\ ] ] and , hence , from the definition of @xmath24 we have that @xmath25}}. \\end{array } \\label{ecua9a}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 describes the soliton shape , whose center will be given by @xmath1 , and where we introduced a second collective variable , @xmath3 , which will represent the kink width as we will see below . this _",
    "ansatz _ takes into account that @xmath27 can be different from the lorentz - contracted width due to the action of the external force . since the internal mode is related with the kink width , we can expect that by using this approach we will be able to explain the kink motion when the internal mode is excited .",
    "however , the linearized problem around the initial kink solution tells us that perturbations of the kink can not only shift its position or change its width , but also make it emit radiation @xcite .",
    "we have not considered this effect and therefore the _ ansatz _ is only valid when the external force is so small that practically no radiation is emitted . since the frequencies of the discrete internal mode @xmath28 and the continuum phonon band @xmath29 are apart from each other one can expect that the two kinds of modes are excited at different values of the parameters of the external force , and then when resonances appear as a consequence of the excitation of the internal mode one can in principle neglect the effect of radiation . in any event",
    "all our analytical results will have to be confirmed later by numerical simulations , which will show whether or not this assumption is correct .    to obtain the equations for our collective coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath3 we will follow @xcite ( see the appendix for another possible derivation )",

    "furthermore , we have not been able to solve the collective coordinate equations for the damped ( @xmath221 ) case ; it is reasonable to expect that in this situation phenomena similar to those found for the undamped case will arise , but in so far this is not checked this assertion remains a conjecture .    in view of the above considerations ,",
    "we have computed the numerical solution of the partial differential equations ( [ ecua6 ] ) and ( [ ecua7 ] ) by using the strauss - vzquez scheme @xcite and choosing a total length for our numerical system of @xmath222 , with steps @xmath223 , @xmath224 , free boundary conditions , and simulating up to a final time equal to @xmath225 with a kink at rest as initial condition .",
    "in addition , we have fixed the amplitude @xmath226 and the phase @xmath227 of the ac force and then we have changed the value of the driving frequency @xmath7 in order to see the resonances .",
    "we note that there are many other parameters we could change , such as the initial velocity , the driving amplitude , or the driving phase , but as our main goal in this section is to assert the validity of the general analytical results obtained above we prefer to concentrate on a few cases as mentioned . in all our simulations",
    "we have chosen the initial parameters in such a way that @xmath89 , because when @xmath157 the kink moves to the right or to the left and then for large times the kink will leave our finite system . for the aforesaid values of initial parameters",
    "the width of the resonance region @xmath228 predicted at @xmath229 in the section iii ( a ) [ see eqs .",
    "( [ ecua37 ] ) and ( [ ecua38 ] ) ] , is of the order of @xmath230 .",
    "for this reason we have explored the regions around @xmath231 and @xmath8 in an interval of that order . finally , we want to mention that with the strauss - vzquez method one can compute very accurately the position and the velocity of the kink center using the integrals of energy and momentum @xcite , so it is a good numerical method in order to compare to our analytical predictions .",
    "first of all , in order to verify the results obtained by means of the gtwa with two independent collective coordinates , the position and the width of the kink , we have studied the region around @xmath232 , i.e. , the driving frequency for which we do not expect any resonances when @xmath78 ; hence , the width and the velocity should be , at least , bounded functions .",
    "we have verified that this prediction is in excellent agreement with the numerical simulations , an example of which is shown in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . in this plot",
    ", we can see that the velocity is indeed an oscillatory function and even for large times our theoretical approach describes correctly the evolution of the velocity of the center of mass of the kink .",
    "other values close to @xmath233 behave very much like the presented example .",
    "the next test of our analytical results has to be , of course , the existence of a resonance near @xmath10 . for frequencies @xmath7 around @xmath234",
    ", our collective variable approach has predicted that the width @xmath3 increases unboundedly and hence the velocity and the energy should increase as well .",
    "again , the prediction is fulfilled , but for @xmath10 instead of @xmath234 : in the numerical simulations we have observed that in this case a resonance takes place when @xmath235 , as a specific example , the results for the kink energy for @xmath236 and @xmath237 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , clearly showing a resonant increase of the energy in the former case and oscillatory behavior in the latter .",
    "interestingly , at the resonance the velocity also does not have an oscillatory behaviour as depicted in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , in contrast to the behavior off - resonance we found in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for @xmath233 .",
    "such a non - periodic evolution of the kink velocity implies that the kink motion is chaotic as we first found in @xcite and , eventually , the kink begins emitting radiation . as we discussed in @xcite , we believe that this phenomenon has its origin in the energy transfer from the kink internal mode to the rest of modes in the system , a mechanism already demonstrated in @xcite ; intuitively , the reason for that is that the collective coordinate prediction that the kink width grows without limit can not be physically true due to the own nature of the kink , and hence , when the internal mode excitation reaches large values the energy ends up being transferred to the rest of the available modes ( translation and radiation ) .    after checking our analytical results for the undamped case , we now have to turn to the damped ( @xmath221 ) dynamics , in order to find out whether the same phenomena arise there .",
    "simulations for the damped case show that the energy of the system also increases when the resonance takes place ( see fig .  [ f5 ] ) , but in this case the energy is bounded due to the dissipation , reaches an asymptotic value , and thus does not increase indefinitely as in the absence of damping . for comparison of both situations",
    "we have computed the mean energy in the time interval @xmath238 with and without damping , and our results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ f6 ] and [ f7 ] . for @xmath239",
    "( see points on the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] ) we have found that the energy increases at @xmath240 , whereas for @xmath65 ( see the points on the dashed line in fig .  [ f6 ] ) , the resonance frequency is @xmath241 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the numerical solutions of the full partial differential equation show that the resonance at @xmath242 also takes place for @xmath63 , whereas when @xmath11 ( see fig .  [ f7 ] ) the resonance disappears .",
    "let us recall that in all our simulations we have chosen @xmath116 ( and hence the resonant region should be the widest possible one ) and @xmath117 , in such a way that @xmath89 . in the case when @xmath217 vanishes",
    "we can not expect any resonances at @xmath11 . nevertheless , in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] it is clear that the energy increases weakly in this region . we believe that this maximum of the energy is probably due to the fact that the condition for the suppression of the resonance at @xmath11 is extremely difficult to fulfill numerically . on the other hand",
    ", it is also possible that this condition , which has been obtained within the collective coordinate framework , is only approximately true , and therefore when we choose @xmath78 we are beginning with an initial condition close to the one needed for complete suppression of the resonance but not exactly there , and hence we would still see the small bump in fig .",
    "another possible reason for this peak is that it is possible that when @xmath89 at @xmath243 a resonance appears in the next order corrections ( see the work of segur @xcite , in which the frequency @xmath244 arises , and could then be parametrically excited by @xmath245 ) .",
    "were this the case , this `` weaker resonance '' , that completely disappears for @xmath63 [ see the solid line in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ] , is the resonance that we can expect either when @xmath246 in the partial differential equation or for @xmath89 and large enough times .",
    "we have shown analytically and numerically that the internal mode of the @xmath0 model can be excited if we drive the system with an ac force of a frequency close to @xmath247 of the internal mode frequency .",
    "this is a very surprising result as the driving we are applying to the system is not parametric . at resonance , as a consequence of the increment of the energy of the system , the kink initially at rest begins to move chaotically @xcite and also begins to radiate , i.e. , the energy is transferred from the internal mode to the translational and radiational ones .",
    "the chaotic motion is confirmed by noting that , when the internal mode is excited at @xmath242 , in the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) of the kink s velocity [ see fig .",
    "[ f4 ] ] we see some frequencies in the low frequency part of the spectrum aside from the frequency of the ac force , @xmath7 . what is more important , we have presented a full analysis of the collective coordinate theory for this problem , whose validity has been undoubtedly confirmed by numerical simulations of the full partial differential equation . in particular , in the absence of damping we have been able to find analytically all the resonances as well as their dependence on the kink initial conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "we have also shown that the resonance at @xmath11 can be suppressed if we add a small damping to the system or by an appropriate choice of initial parameters of the ac force .",
    "we have verified in our simulations that for @xmath11 the lower radiational modes are excited and for this reason the energy in fig .  [ f7 ] increases when @xmath7 increases .",
    "of course , this excitation of the lowest phonons can not be explained within the present collective coordinate theory ; a much more involved approach including phonon effects ( as in @xcite for the sg model ) would probably account for that resonance .    beyond the application of our results to the @xmath0 kink dynamics",
    ", we believe that the same phenomenology will arise in other systems for which internal modes are present as , for example , in the double sg equation @xcite .",
    "the analysis we have presented can be straightforwardly extended to this system , and it is quite likely that similar resonance effects will arise , as well as in other models with the same feature of internal modes . a related interesting question concerns the applicability of these results to the sg equation . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", our calculation applies directly to the sg equation , but in this system the kinks do not posses internal modes .",
    "therefore , the identification @xmath248 we have done for the @xmath0 kink is not available any more , and , what is worse , the putative @xmath4 lies within the phonon band .",
    "however , it has been reported that close to @xmath4 sg kinks might exhibit a quasi - mode @xcite with a very long life .",
    "if such a mode indeed exists , which is still in doubt since no other reports of its existence have been published , it could be found by looking at resonances , as we have done in this paper , at half its frequency , which would be _ outside _ the phonon band .",
