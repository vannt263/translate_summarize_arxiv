    "the evolution of dark matter can be accurately modelled within the @xmath0 cold dark matter ( @xmath0cdm ) scenario , giving the number density of collapsed objects ( e.g. , dark matter halos ) of given mass as a function of redshift . in the widely accepted model of galaxy evolution , galaxies form within the gravitational potential wells of host dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "thus , we can reduce the problem of modelling galaxy populations to one of working out the set of assumptions on how to relate luminous with dark matter .",
    "in fact , simple instructions can provide an excellent description of the observed clustering of galaxies in the near ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and in the more distant universe ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    in the galaxy formation framework , structure builds hierarchically , with smaller halos being the first to collapse and merge together to build up larger haloes over time .",
    "galaxies , as permanent residents of these haloes , must therefore also grow through merging , but the link between galaxy growth ( in terms of stellar mass ) and halo growth ( in terms of dark matter mass ) is far from direct .",
    "firstly , stellar mass in galaxies may also grow through the process of turning cold gas into stars , and secondly galaxy growth through merging is slower than halo growth - galaxies do not always merge when their host haloes do , and there is strong evidence that stellar mass may not be conserved during such a process ( @xcite ) .    there is a firmly - established colour bimodality in the galaxy population seen at low redshift ( e.g. @xcite ) , and this continues to earlier epochs ( e.g , @xcite ) .",
    "this striking separation of the galaxy population into a blue ( star - forming ) and red ( quiescent ) clouds must therefore be an outcome of any galaxy evolution model .",
    "understanding how these two populations evolve , and how galaxies go from one cloud to the other ( i.e. what process quenches star formation ) , has been a long - standing quest in galaxy evolution , and one for which clustering studies have the potential of being particularly insightful .",
    "the large - scale clustering strength of a particular population of galaxies is directly linked to the host dark matter halo mass @xcite .",
    "consequently , studying the clustering properties of a sample of galaxies , as well as its evolution with redshift , remains as one of the most powerful ways to constrain galaxy evolution .",
    "many previous studies have investigated the clustering of galaxies as a function of their colour and luminosity ( recent studies include , e.g. , @xcite ) . in broad terms , it has become clear that the large - scale clustering strength increases with luminosity , and with redder colour .",
    "clustering measurements of galaxy sub - populations , in one sense , represent statistical restatements and refinements of the well known morphology - density relationship @xcite , which is now known more accurately as a colour - density relationship ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we now know that the bi - modality in the colours of galaxies extends to their large - scale clustering strengths , revealing that a halo - mass dependent effect is important in delineating blue from red galaxies .",
    "essentially , the most luminous , most red galaxies occupy the highest peaks in the density fields , and for any particular luminosity , red galaxies are found to occupy higher peaks than their blue counterparts .",
    "this suggests red galaxies were the first to begin their hierarchical mass assembly  qualitatively consistent with the interpretation that they are red because they have used up / been stripped of their cold gas ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if we now focus on the clustering of red galaxies , there is interesting evidence that their large - scale clustering strength increases towards the faint end ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the natural interpretation is that faint red galaxies are predominantly satellite galaxies in large mass haloes .",
    "this would further imply that red galaxies with luminosities @xmath1@xmath2 prefer less massive halos than their brighter and fainter counterparts  qualitatively consistent with the picture of s0 galaxies occupying groups and luminous and dwarf red galaxies occupying clusters .    while it is uncontroversial that a significant percentage of faint red galaxies are satellites in large mass haloes , the exact proportion that are satellites , and whether this is sufficient that these galaxies dominate the population , is less clear .",
    "@xcite , selecting on colour , find that dwarf red galaxies ( fainter than those studied in any of the other cited works here ) are predominantly central , rather than satellite galaxies .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite , who , when selecting on h@xmath3 emission , find nearly all red dwarf galaxies are satellites .",
    "furthermore , there is some tension between analyses of large - scale bias and the work of @xcite , as they find that faint red galaxies have a very weak contribution to this growth of luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , i.e. if the faint galaxies occupy the same halos as lrgs , they are somehow precluded from merging with them .",
    "finally , @xcite do not see an upturn in the large - scale bias towards fainter luminosities when studying red galaxies in the bootes field , using photometric redshifts .",
    "motivated partly by the tension described in the previous paragraph , and partly by the desire to study fainter red galaxies , in this work we take a new look at the large - scale bias of red galaxies in the sdss seventh and final data release , using both photometric and spectroscopic data .",
    "the photometric data allows us to analyse a significantly larger volume of the universe containing the lower luminosity galaxies than the spectroscopic data .",
    "this means we can consider the same volume to analyse a wide range of galaxy luminosities .",
    "we also use the cross - correlation between these data with brighter spectroscopic data to confirm the robustness of our results .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : data ] we describe the photometric and spectroscopic redshift catalogs we use for our measurements . in section  [ sec : meth ] we describe how we measure correlation functions ( angular auto- and cross - correlation functions and redshift space 3d auto - correlation functions ) and how we use these measurements to measure the bias of galaxy samples . in section",

    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "we use data from the sdss seventh data release ( dr7 ) .",
    "this survey obtained wide - field ccd photometry ( @xcite ) in five passbands ( @xmath10 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , amassing nearly 10,000 square degrees of imaging data for which object detection is reliable to @xmath11 ( @xcite ) . from these photometric data ,",
    "spectroscopic targets have been identified and observed yielding a sample of galaxies with over 600,000 spectroscopic redshifts complete to a @xcite magnitude limit of @xmath12 occupying over 8,000 square degrees ( @xcite ) .",
    "we utilize data from both the spectroscopic redshift catalog ( as this allows precise redshift information ) and a photometric redshift catalog ( as this allows us to go more than 2 magnitudes deeper ) .",
    "the photometric redshifts used were obtained from the sdss photoz table .",
    "redshifts in this catalog were estimated using a hybrid template / empirical approach , and the output includes rest - frame absolute magnitudes , k - corrections , and galaxy - type values . we include all galaxies with @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( which makes our sample approximately volume limited for @xmath15 ) . in order to select red galaxies , we use the ( k - corrected ) double colour cut @xmath16 which ensures that the galaxies are truly red and there are few blue interlopers in our sample .",

    "our double cut clearly removes galaxies that are close to our cut limit , giving us a distinct sample of galaxies ( more so than selecting on type value provided in the photoz table ) .",
    "we find that performing this double - cut also improves the reliability of the photometric redshift estimates .",

    "these samples were selected to be approximately volume limited ; one is limited to @xmath28 ( 129435 galaxies ) and a second limited to @xmath29 ( 140341 galaxies ) .",
    "we now outline the methodology used to calculate the bias of red galaxies as a function of their absolute magnitude . for the photometric data and for cross - correlations with the spectroscopic data , we use the projected angular correlation function . for the spectroscopic data we consider the full 3d correlation function .      in order to calculate angular auto - correlation and cross - correlation functions , @xmath30",
    ", we use the @xcite estimator @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( and @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) represent separate data samples for the cross - correlation and are the same for the auto - correlation .",
    "our random catalog representing the photometric data contains 10 million points and is the same as used in r10 .",
    "the photometric catalogs ( data and random ) are masked for seeing , reddening , bright stars , satellite trails , etc . in the same manner as r10 . at scales",
    "larger than @xmath36 , we employ a pixel based routine using sdsspix .",
    "we use the pixel resolution ( 64 ) such that the pixels have an area with equivalent circular radius of @xmath37 .",
    "we confirm that the point to point and pixelized methods agree at overlapping scales .",
    "the random catalog representing the spectroscopic data contains over 6 million points and was created as described in @xcite , with a pixel based mask based on healpix @xcite .",
    "we use a jackknife method ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with inverse - variance weighting to estimate the errors and covariance matrix ( e.g. , @xcite ) for @xmath30 .",
    "the method is nearly identical to the method described in detail in ross et al .",
    "( 2007 ; hereafter r07 ) and applied to dr7 data in r10 .",
    "the jackknife method works by creating many subsamples of the entire data set , each with a small part of the total area removed .",
    "r07 found that 20 jack - knife subsamplings are sufficient to create a stable covariance matrix , and we therefore use 20 .",
    "these 20 subsamples are created by extracting a contiguous grouping of 1/20th of the unmasked pixels in 20 separate areas . our covariance matrix , @xmath38 ,",
    "is thus given by @xmath39[\\omega_{full}(\\theta_j ) - \\omega_{k}(\\theta_j ) ] , & ~ \\end{array } \\label{eq : jk}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the value for the correlation measurement omitting the @xmath41th subsample of data and @xmath42 and @xmath43 refer to the @xmath44 and @xmath45 angular bin .",
    "the jackknife errors are simply the square - root of diagonal elements of the covariance matrix .      in order to calculate the 3d auto - correlation function , @xmath46",
    ", we again employ the @xcite estimator but in this case @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are now functions of @xmath50 , the physical separation we calculate given our assumed cosmology , and also @xmath51 , the cosine of the angle between the radial direction and the alignment of a galaxy pair .",
    "further , we must assign the randoms radial positions , which we do by sampling a fine resolution cubic spline fit to the galaxy redshift distribution .",
    "we also weight each galaxy according to the number density at its radial position @xcite : this weight is optimal if the galaxies poisson sample the density field .",
    "we analytically estimate the errors and covariance of the @xmath46 measurements . given optimal weights , @xmath52 , and the power spectrum , @xmath53 ,",
    "its error can be estimated by @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 ^ 2d^3r$ ] and @xmath56 .",
    "given that the correlation function is just the fourier transform of the power - spectrum , we can estimate the covariance , @xmath57 , in the measured @xmath58 between bins centred at @xmath59 and @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the kronecker delta , and @xmath63 is the number of pairs included in the bin .",
    "note that although this procedure ignores correlations induced by the sample window function , it should be sufficiently accurate for the analysis attempted in this work , as we only wish to measure the broad amplitude of the clustering rather than the relative clustering on different scales : for such measurements of amplitude , correlations between data are unimportant .",
    "we model the non - linear power - spectrum using the fitting formulae of @xcite , which we use in combination with the transfer function of @xcite to include the effects of baryons . given this power - spectrum , we determine the isotropic 3-dimensional real - space correlation function @xmath64 via fourier transform .",

    "we will be comparing our models to measurements limited to different maximum @xmath51 values .",
    "thus , the model will become @xmath70    in order to calculate model @xmath30 , we must project @xmath71 over the radial distribution of galaxy pairs in a particular sample ( or samples in the case of cross - correlations ) .",

    "the galaxy separation @xmath75 is a function of the angular separation of the galaxies @xmath76 and their redshifts @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( as is @xmath51 ) .",
    "the photometric redshifts we use have significant error associated with each redshift estimate .",
    "this implies that estimation of the true redshift distribution of the photometric redshift data is not trivial . in order to estimate the true redshift distribution for each of our photometric samples ,",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in r10 . given a redshift estimate and its error , we assume a gaussian pdf .",
    "we then convolve this pdf with the luminosity function and volume element / redshift relationship to obtain a final pdf , which we then sample 10 times . in this work",
    ", we find that adding a bias to the photometric redshifts ( simply a shift in the mean ) of + 0.005 for each sample allows for the best agreement between all of our clustering measurements ( see section  [ sec : photb ] ) .",
    "we can construct @xmath4 distributions in a similar manner .",
    "given the @xmath4 of the redshift estimate , we can calculate the value of @xmath4 at any point along the redshift pdf based on the change in the distance modulus , thus obtaining a pdf of @xmath4 for each galaxy .",
    "this allows us to determine the expected mean @xmath4 for any particular photometric redshift sample .",
    "when we calculate angular cross - correlations between photometric and spectroscopic samples , the redshift ranges of the samples are not matched .",
    "thus , the distribution of luminosities of the galaxies that contribute to the measured clustering signal will not necessarily match that of either sample . in order to find the expected mean @xmath4 of galaxies contributing to the cross - correlation",
    ", we can simply ignore the parts of the redshift pdf outside the spectroscopic redshift bound and thereby determine the effective mean @xmath4 of photometric galaxies between any chosen spectroscopic redshift bounds .",
    "we assume a simple linear bias model between the the 2-pt clustering in the dark matter and galaxy over - density fields , such that the bias @xmath69 , is defined by @xmath79 in the regime where linear theory is a good approximation this relationship naturally extends to @xmath64 and @xmath30 .",
    "the use of the @xcite non - linear @xmath53 has the potential to extend this relationship to weakly non - linear scales .",

    "for the 3d correlation functions , @xmath30 is replaced by @xmath83 and @xmath76 by @xmath50 .",
    "we measure the bias of galaxies in our photometric samples by measuring their respective auto - correlations and cross - correlations with the spectroscopic sample of galaxies with @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( which we denote  full \" ) .",
    "the redshift limit means this sample covers most of the redshift distribution of the photometric samples and the absolute magnitude limit ensures that the bias of the galaxies in the sample should not change significantly with redshift .",
    "based on @xmath30 measurements with @xmath86 , the bias of the full spectroscopic sample is @xmath87 , which agrees with the results of @xcite , as it lies between the bias values of their @xmath88 and @xmath89 samples .",
    "we determine the mean @xmath4 of each photometric sample by estimating the distribution of @xmath4 values as described in section [ sec : nz ] .",
    "the cross - correlation with the spectroscopic sample implies a hard limit of @xmath90 for the photometric galaxies contributing signal to the measured cross - correlations .",
    "we find that imposing this limit when calculating the magnitude distribution changes the mean @xmath4 value by less than 0.05 magnitudes in every case .",
    "this implies that the @xmath90 limit makes only a small difference to any of the magnitude distributions of the photometric galaxies that contribute to the cross - correlation signal .",
    "therefore , it is valid to expect the bias of the photometric galaxies contributing to the auto - correlation signal to be the same as the bias of the photometric galaxies contributing signal to the cross - correlation with the @xmath90 spectroscopic sample .",
    "[ fig : photw ] displays the measured @xmath30 for our three main photometric samples .",
    "the auto - correlations are shown by the black triangles and the cross - correlations are displayed in red - squares , with luminosity increasing from bottom to top .",
    "the solid curves display the best - fit model @xmath30 fit for @xmath91 , where we have jointly fit the @xmath30 auto- and cross - correlations ( note , bias values can be independently determined for the auto- and cross - correlations ; the joint - fit determines the most consistent value and reduces the overall uncertainty ) .",
    "we restrict the fits to @xmath92 because systematic effects in the data ( due to , e.g. , reddening and star / galaxy separation ) and the modelling ( effects of redshift space distortions ) become more significant at larger angular scales .",
    "the jack - knife errors increase only slightly over our range of measurements , due to competing effects of cosmic variance and shot - noise .",
    "the mean @xmath4 and best - fit @xmath69 values corresponding to these joint fits are -18.46 , 1.2@xmath930.05 , -19.46 , 1.43@xmath930.07 , and -20.39 , 1.40@xmath930.07 , with respective @xmath82 values of 13.3 , 16.0 , and 17.0 ( and 13 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "we note that these values remain constant ( within the 1@xmath94 error - bars ) regardless of the minimum scale we fit to between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .    in order to test the robustness of these results to the photometric redshift determination",
    ", we have also obtained estimates of @xmath69 for galaxies of different luminosity by cross - correlating the photometric samples with spectroscopic samples covering different redshift ranges .",
    "the cross - correlation signal depends on the number of galaxies in the photometric sample that lie within the redshift range covered by the spectroscopic sample , so testing whether these bias estimates match those from our full sample tests the assumed distribution of photometric redshifts .",
    "we cross - correlate each photometric sample with two additional spectroscopic samples ; one with @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( which denote  near \" ) and second with @xmath99 , @xmath85 ( which we denote  far \" ) .",

    "note that the joint fit estimates of @xmath69 serve as our primary results , while the additional cross - correlations serve as a ( correlated ) consistency check .",
    "the fact that the results from all cross - correlations agree is important confirmation that photometric redshift distributions we have estimated are accurate .",
    "we note that if we do not include the photometric redshift bias of + 0.005 , the cross - correlations do not yield consistent results . for every sample ,",
    "the cross - correlation with the near data would imply a much lower ( by @xmath1 30% ) value of @xmath69 and the cross - correlation with the far sample would yield a much higher ( by @xmath1 25% ) value of @xmath69 , implying ( the obviously incorrect result ) that @xmath104 would be highly oscillatory .",
    "however , this photometric redshift bias does not have a strong effect on the best - fit @xmath69 values of the three main samples .",
    "when the photometric redshift bias is set to zero , the best - fit @xmath69 values decrease slightly to @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 with increasing luminosity .",
    "we have tested our results further by making changes both to the data we use and the modelling .",
    "we find that our results do not change ( within 1@xmath94 ) regardless of the minimum angular scale we use to find the best - fit data .",

    "we find that this can slightly improve the @xmath82 values , but not to the extent demanded by removing a degree of freedom .",
    "importantly , doing so does not change the trend we find with @xmath4  the bias of the lowest luminosity red galaxies is always lowest .",
    "we find the same behaviour with different colour cuts and also if we make changes to the redshift / magnitude limits .",
    "no matter the analysis we apply , we find the same result  red galaxies with @xmath108 have lower bias than their brighter counterparts .",

    "this behaviour is similar to that reported previously by @xcite and also @xcite .",

    "the bias results that we expect to have the least systematic effects are those calculated from measurements at the largest scales ( since we expect linear theory to be most valid at larger physical scales ) and those calculated for pairs furthest from the line of sight , since they should be the least dependent on redshift space distortions ( rsd ) .",
    "note that we minimize the effects of linear rsd .",
    "we do allow for linear rsd in our modelling , but studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) have shown that linear rsd models begin to fail at larger scales than real - space clustering models . perhaps more importantly ,",
    "we minimize any of fingers - of - god ( fog ) effects @xcite .",
    "the effects of fog imply that , by restricting our analysis to transverse pairs , we are preferentially discounting pairs of galaxies within dark - matter halos . note that for the purposes of measuring the linear bias , this is entirely appropriate , as the clustering of galaxies within dark matter halos is clearly non - linear .",
    "we thus believe that , of the data included in fig .  [",
    "fig : xib ] , the @xmath125mpc , @xmath124 results are the most trustworthy . the @xmath82/dof values are all much smaller for the @xmath125mpc fits , as for @xmath126 , the @xmath82/dof values are all greater ( and as high as 6 ) than 2.4 for @xmath127mpc and they are all less than 1 for @xmath125mpc . for @xmath124 ,",

    "we simply determine the inverse - variance weighted mean of the ratio between each of their samples an the @xmath133 sample and then take its square root to estimate the relative bias of each of their samples .",

    "also plotted are the recent results of three other recent studies of the clustering of red galaxies . ]",
    "all of the results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : speccom ] agree quite well for the most luminous red galaxies with @xmath135 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath136 , the agreement between our spectroscopic analysis with @xmath137mpc , @xmath114 ( blue squares ) , @xcite , and @xcite is excellent . for less luminous red galaxies ,",
    "the bias is strongly dependent on the sample and method used .",
    "we find that a choice of @xmath138mpc , @xmath113 ( black triangles ) for the spectroscopic data analysis produces a result that is quite similar to @xcite and @xcite , while the fit with @xmath137mpc , @xmath114 ( blue squares ) shows strong disagreement .",
    "the dramatic change in the best - fit bias as a function of @xmath119 and @xmath115 suggests that non - linear effects have a great influence on the clustering of faint red galaxies , even to scales @xmath139mpc .",
    "the correlation function measurements we perform on the spectroscopic samples ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ximeas ] ) are consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite , which found bright and faint red galaxies to have the highest over - densities on 8@xmath121mpc scales .",
    "@xcite fit their power spectra measurements to similarly small scales , as they used @xmath140mpc@xmath141 .",
    "further , the measurements of @xcite were restricted to @xmath142mpc , and their bias estimates are therefore quite different than ours .",
    "larger scales appear to be required in order to escape the influence of non - linearities .",
    "@xcite use a larger physical scale ( 20@xmath121 mpc ) for the radius of their cells , but being that they use counts - in - cells , the counts in large cells are highly covariant with those of smaller scales , and non - linearities may persist .",
    "further , while all of the studies we cite do attempt to account for redshift - space distortions , none explicitly remove pairs oriented along the line - of - sight , suggesting the possibility that systematic effects may still be present .    if we focus only on dr7 data with minimal contribution from clustering along the line of sight , the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr7bias ] ( the @xmath131 and @xmath30 measurements should be dominated by transverse pairs ) . within the 1@xmath94 error - bars ,",
    "only the measured bias of the @xmath143 photometric sample appears inconsistent with the rest of the data , but it is consistent to within 2@xmath94 .",
    "given the number of data points ( 19 ) , this is reasonable statistically .",
    "the consistency of the data can be further confirmed by the fact that a fit to @xmath144 has minimum @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 ( this suggests only that this data is consistent with a smoothly varying function and do not believe it should be extrapolated outside of the @xmath4 values we present ) .",
    "the combination of data suggests that the bias of red galaxies increases dramatically for galaxies more luminous than -21.5 , the bias of red galaxies is nearly constant for @xmath148 , but for @xmath108 the bias decreases significantly .",
    "a reasonable interpretation of the compiled results is that the previously reported increase in the bias of red galaxies as the luminosity decreases is correct only for non - linear scales and therefore not directly related to the average mass of the halos that faint red galaxies occupy .",
    "non - linear effects were made stronger due to redshift distortions and non - linear clustering , further exacerbated by the very small volume occupied by the low luminosity galaxies .",
    "the studies that utilize larger volumes ( the photometric data ) or use results only where the influence of clustering along the line of sight is minimized ( the spectroscopic data herein with @xmath118 , @xcite ) agree that the bias of red galaxies displays a monotonic increase with luminosity .",
    "our results suggest that redshift distortions and non - linear clustering have a large effect on the measured clustering of faint red galaxies , even at large scales .",
    "physically , this makes sense .",
    "we know that a significant percentage of faint red galaxies are satellites in high mass halos .",
    "this implies that a significant proportion of the pairs of faint red galaxies are satellites within the same dark matter halo and their true physical separations are as large as a few @xmath121mpc ( the virial radius of a @xmath149 halo is @xmath1 1 @xmath121mpc ) .",
    "thus , even given the true 3d distribution of galaxies , we would expect to find non - linear effects have more influence on the clustering of faint red galaxies than for other galaxy sub - populations .",
    "finger - of - god effects exacerbate the the non - linear effects .",
    "consider a pair of satellite galaxies oriented perpendicularly to the line of sight with a separation of 2@xmath121mpc : assuming they orbit the centre of mass of their dark matter halo at 500km / s , we would interpret their physical separation to be greater than @xmath150mpc .",
    "thus , in redshift space , fog effects project non - linear clustering to larger scales , and the magnitude of this effect should be largest for faint red galaxies . by ignoring pairs close to the line - of - sight ,",
    "fog effects mean that satellite pairs with apparent large - separations are preferentially removed .",
    "however , these pairs do not truly have large - separations , and should not contribute to the true large - scale clustering .",
    "this explains why removing these pairs brings the results closer in amplitude to the projected clustering results .",
    "given that studies such as @xcite have found that the pairwise - velocity - dispersion is greatest for red galaxies with @xmath136 , the fog effect has its strongest impact on the clustering we measure for the faintest galaxies .",
    "previous studies have found an upturn in the large scale bias of red galaxies towards faint luminosities , and this behaviour has been attributed to the fact that these galaxies are predominantly satellites in larger mass haloes ( @xcite ) . in section  [ sec : intro ]",
    "we partially motivated this work by pointing out that the implications of @xcite and @xcite suggested a possible tension with the previous clustering studies .",
    "the results we present in this paper show that the reports of an upturn in the bias relationship likely can not be interpreted as an upturn in the linear bias , due to systematic effects .",
    "we find that the large - scale , linear , bias of red galaxies monotonically decreases with decreasing luminosity .",
    "this in turn suggests that satellite faint red galaxies , residing in massive haloes , are not dominant by number with respect to central faint red galaxies or faint red satellites of @xmath151 galaxies .",
    "measurements of the satellite fraction in the red cloud vary .",
    "@xcite suggest a value of 30% which does not vary significantly between @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "@xcite find that the fraction of stellar mass in satellites increases with host dark matter halo mass , and such that in haloes with @xmath154 there is more mass in satellites than centrals . at z=0",
    ", they conclude that 30% of the stellar mass in the red sequence ( not number of galaxies ) is in satellites .",
    "@xcite , using a group catalogue and studying very faint ( dwarf ) red galaxies , conclude that at only around 45% are satellites .",
    "@xcite suggest an incredibly large satellite fraction of 90% at the faintest end ( @xmath25 ) , up from 33% at the intermediate luminosity range ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "interestingly , the hod model that gives these values ( driven by the small - scale clustering ) over - predicts the large - scale clustering amplitude . an alternative hod model , that only allows red satellites in haloes with @xmath156 , reduces the total satellite fraction in the red cloud to 34% and provides a significantly better fit to the data at large scales .",
    "note the apparent contradiction to previous studies ; forcing satellite red galaxies to only occupy high mass halos _ reduces _ the large scale bias , due to the fact that such a model allows a lower satellite fraction .",
    "combined , the results of previous studies suggest that the satellite fraction of red cloud galaxies is @xmath157 and may increase towards the faint end .",
    "this suggests that , while the satellite fraction allows the bias of red galaxies to remain high relative to blue galaxies , the propensity of faint red galaxies to be central galaxies in low mass halos allows their bias to decrease monotonically .",
    "central faint red galaxies present an interesting puzzle in galaxy formation .",
    "it has been observationally established that the satellite population is in general redder that central galaxies of the same mass ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . this can be explained by environmental effects as the galaxy falls onto a more massive halo : a slow or a sudden stripping of the gas reservoir , due to infall , ram - pressure or tidal heating ( see , e.g , .",
    "however , a central galaxy has not experienced a direct infall onto a larger halo .",
    "one possibility is that put forward by @xcite , in which galaxies may experience some form of these environmental effects when passing by a dark matter halo ( within 3 times the virial radius ) , without falling in . another possibility is simply that the process that shut down star formation in these galaxies in different , or driven by feedback effects .",
    "we have computed the large scale bias of red galaxies in the sdss dr7 as a function of luminosity .",
    "we use both photometric and spectroscopic data to obtain robust results and utilize the largest volume possible .",
    "our major findings are :    @xmath158 the bias of red galaxies we measure in our photometric data implies the faintest red galaxies have the lowest bias ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : photbias ] ) .",
    "this result is independent of any treatment we apply to the data or its analysis .",
    "@xmath158 the bias increases dramatically with increasing luminosity for galaxies with @xmath159 .",
    "there is no evidence for evolution in the bias for galaxies with @xmath160 , and there is weak evidence for a decrease in bias with decreasing luminosity for fainter galaxies ( see figs . 5 , 6 , and 7 ) .",
    "@xmath158 the bias of red galaxies measured in our spectroscopic samples depends greatly on how we choose to analyze the data ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) . the treatment that we believe is most free of systematics ( @xmath161mpc , @xmath162 ) recovers a monotonic increase in the bias of red galaxies as a function of luminosity .",
    "this suggests that previous reports of an upturn at low luminosities in the large - scale bias red galaxies were systematically affected by a combination of redshift - space distortions and non - linearities .",
    "the results that we show here , based on the large - scale clustering , give only an incomplete picture of what is happening at the faint end as we can not disentangle the contribution from central and satellite galaxies to the overall observed bias value . in some sense the bias of faint red galaxies represents the interplay between the number of satellites ( with strong bias , in high mass haloes ) , and centrals ( with low bias , in low mass haloes ) .",
    "nonetheless our results are in good qualitative agreement with other measurements of the fraction of red satellites in the sense that the fraction of satellites is not expected to be dominant even at the faint end .",
    "treatment of the clustering of red galaxies utilizing halo - occupation - distribution modelling to constrain the evolution and mass - assembly of red galaxies will be presented in a follow - up paper .",
