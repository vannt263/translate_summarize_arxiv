    "in heavy ion collisions , the transverse momenta of outgoing particles are correlated with the direction of the impact parameter ( reaction plane ) of the two incoming nuclei .",
    "for example , at energies above 100  mev per nucleon , nucleons in the projectile rapidity region are deflected away from the target .",
    "this collective effect is usually referred to as directed ( or sidewards ) flow .",
    "it is characterized by the first fourier coefficient of the particle azimuthal distribution , @xmath0  @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the azimuthal angle of an outgoing particle , @xmath3 is the azimuth of the reaction plane , and angular brackets denote an average over events and over all particles in a given transverse momentum and rapidity window . _ differential _ flow is characterized by @xmath4 that describes the directed flow in a narrow transverse momentum ( @xmath5 ) and rapidity ( @xmath6 ) interval .",
    "the most common observable to quantify directed flow , introduced by danielewicz and odyniec in 1985  @xcite , is the mean transverse momentum projected on the reaction plane , @xmath7 , as a function of rapidity . in terms of @xmath0 , it can be written as @xmath8 , where the average in the right - hand side is taken over @xmath5 . this observable is believed to be sensitive to the nuclear compressibility and to in - medium cross sections  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , @xmath7 is extracted from azimuthal correlations between the outgoing particles , under the assumption that these correlations are only due to flow .",
    "however , it was soon realized that global momentum conservation also induces azimuthal correlations .",
    "different ways to correct for this effect were devised in refs .",
    "these methods are still in use at intermediate  @xcite as well as at relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "generally , corrections are important for weak flow and/or small systems , when there are physical or detector differences between the forward and backward hemispheres in a reaction .",
    "more detailed information can be obtained on the physics involved in the collision by studying the transverse momentum dependence of directed flow  @xcite , @xmath9 in a given rapidity window .",
    "detailed theoretical studies have been presented for this differential directed flow @xcite .",
    "this was accompanied by new analyses of experimental data , and a wealth of results are now available from fopi at sis  @xcite , e877 at ags  @xcite and na49 at cern  @xcite . in these analyses , unfortunately , correlations arising from momentum conservation are not taken into account .",
    "recently , it was shown  @xcite that they may in fact be of the same order of magnitude as correlations due to flow , leading to a reevaluation of the `` standard '' flow analysis results .    in this paper , we show how to modify standard flow analysis techniques in order to take into account momentum conservation .",

    "[ s : correction ] , we show how this method can be modified to take into account momentum conservation .",
    "the momentum conservation leads to two effects , whose magnitude is controlled by a parameter @xmath10 which is roughly the square root of the fraction of all particles used in the estimate of the event plane .",

    "this spurious correlation can be eliminated through a redefinition of the flow vector ( sec .",

    "our results are discussed in sec .",

    "finally , technical details are exposed in the appendixes [ s : appa ] and [ s : appb ] .",
    "since the orientation of the reaction plane is not known , @xmath0 is extracted from azimuthal correlations between outgoing particles .",
    "the simplest way consists in using two - particle azimuthal correlations  @xcite .",
    "these are related to @xmath0 by the identity : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the flow coefficients associated with each particle .",
