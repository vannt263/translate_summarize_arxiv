    "a small but growing number of statistical comparisons of infrared tracers of dust and microwave observations of `` cmb quality '' have demonstrated repeatedly , but in each case at low significance , an excess of microwave emission , correlated with dust on the sky , and possibly due to spinning or magnetized dust .",

    "et al . _ included lph  201.663 + 1.643  in their sample despite their prejudice that free - free emission might overwhelm any emission from spinning dust .",
    "alternatively , one might anticipate that ionized regions would be good places to find microwave emission from spinning dust , because in those regions , ion collisions with grains are expected to be the largest contributory factor by far in maintaining the spin of the grains @xcite .",
    "because of its special status as the sole hii  region in the list , and because lph  201.663 + 1.643  provided the only very significant detection and was indeed much brighter than the spinning - dust theory would have predicted , we thought that a different explanation might exist .",
    "the alternative model for lph  201.663 + 1.643  that we present in this _",
    "letter _ is the superposition of one source with very large emission measure and very small angular scale with a low emission - measure , extended source .",
    "the combination of a small , optically thick source and a large optically thin source , both emitting by free - free , can create the rising microwave spectrum observed in paper i.",
    "the three observations from table 3 of paper i relevant to this _ letter _ are @xmath0   mjy  sr@xmath1  at @xmath2 5 ghz , 8.25 ghz , and 9.75 ghz .",
    "note that the brightness increases with frequency .",
    "the envelopes of newly forming stars in close proximity to an o - type star can have emission measures as large as @xmath3 over angular scales @xmath4  ( mccullough _ et al . _",
    "an ensemble of externally ionized stellar envelopes could match the angular extent of the dust cloud , but the combined flux from the ensemble would be insufficient to match the observed microwave flux from lph  201.663 + 1.643 which at 9.75 ghz is @xmath5 jy .",
    "for example , the total 15 ghz flux density from the the ensemble of 24 ionized envelopes illuminated by @xmath6c orion is 0.175 jy ( felli _ et al . _  1993 ) .",
    "a better idea would be an ultracompact hii  region , which would intercept all of the uv flux from an ob star , whereas an ensemble of stellar envelopes intercepts only a tiny fraction of the ob star s flux .    in order to estimate the distance to lph  201.663 + 1.643 we searched its vicinity in the simbad database for hot stars that could ionize it and found two , gsc 00737 - 01170 ( o5 : ; v=11.29 ; b - v=0.75 ) and gsc 00737 - 00898 ( o5 ; v=10.27 ; b - v=1.11 ) , where the spectral types and magnitudes are from voroshilov _ et al .",

    "the diffuse component can not be very diffuse , because if it was larger than the 0.2  chop used in paper i at 8.25 and 9.75 ghz , it would be eliminated by the chopping .",
    "although we do not know the angular distribution of free - free emission in this region , we assume that the diffuse free - free component contributes to the brightnesses at each frequency equally except for the @xmath29 spectral index of optically thin free - free . thus , our model is @xmath30 where the model parameters are @xmath31 and the two parameters of the ultracompact hii  region ( its radius @xmath22 and its emission measure , em ) .",
