    "we start by analyzing the pure sc phase at @xmath54 , represented by @xmath55 .",
    "the generally favored @xmath31 belongs to the 2d @xmath56 irreducible representation of the @xmath57 lattice point group @xcite .",
    "the state can be written as a combination of @xmath58 , which gives @xmath59-wave intraband ( @xmath60 ) pairing , and @xmath61 , giving @xmath15-wave intraband pairing .",
    "the @xmath62-wave solutions are degenerate at @xmath5 , but below @xmath5 the time - reversal symmetry breaking chiral combinations @xmath63 have the lowest energy .",
    "this follows from a simple energy argument since the @xmath62 states have nodal quasiparticles , whereas the @xmath64 states are fully gapped , see fig .  [",
    "fig : syms ] .",
    "the chiral @xmath65-wave state has a @xmath66 chern number , which can be viewed as the winding number for the intraband op around the brillouin zone center .",
    "we can , alternatively , consider the symmetry of the intraband op around @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath65 state has @xmath68-wave symmetry around @xmath69 , but @xmath70-wave symmetry around @xmath71 @xcite , such that each valley contributes @xmath72 to @xmath73 .",
    "the sign change between the valleys is dictated by the spin - singlet nature , which enforces even parity with respect to the zone center .",
    "a finite @xmath16 adds the spin - triplet , odd - parity op @xmath74 to the intraband pairing . the existence of this spin - triplet component has dramatic consequences , due to the chirality and the @xmath75 phase shift of @xmath76 relative to @xmath60 .",
    "adding @xmath76 to the @xmath59 state directly makes this state develop an imaginary part , such that it has @xmath77-wave symmetry around @xmath69 but the opposite @xmath78-wave chirality around @xmath71 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : syms ] .",
    "thus , for finite @xmath16 , the @xmath59 state becomes a time - reversal breaking mixed chirality sc state with opposite op winding in the two valleys , but @xmath79 when summed over the whole brillouin zone .",
    "this mixed chirality state requires the combination of a spin - singlet ( @xmath80 ) and a spin - triplet ( @xmath81 ) component , since the spin - singlet pairing changes sign between @xmath69 and @xmath71 but the spin - triplet does not .",
    "this is why a magnetic moment @xmath16 , with its accompanying spin - triplet @xmath76 , is necessary for generating mixed chirality @xmath0-wave superconductivity .",
    "starting instead from the @xmath15-wave state just interchanges @xmath82 and @xmath83 . with the @xmath76 contribution , the @xmath59 state becomes fully gapped , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : syms ] . quite the opposite happens for the @xmath65 state . at finite",
    "@xmath16 it still has a @xmath66 winding .",
    "however , the @xmath84 and @xmath76 intraband terms now start to cancel around @xmath71 , as seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : syms ] .",
    "this results in very low - lying quasiparticle excitations around @xmath71 ( @xmath69 for @xmath85 ) as @xmath16 increases .",
    "the quasiparticle energy spectrum shows that a phase transition must occur at some critical @xmath18 , between the chiral @xmath0-wave state favorable at @xmath54 and the mixed chirality @xmath0-wave state .",
    "this preference for the mixed chirality state relies on a simple energy argument and is thus general and independent on a particular model . to find @xmath18 specifically for @xmath43 we minimize its free energy with respect to the three bond ops @xmath31 .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt](a ) the critical moment as a function of @xmath36 for the bare parameters , in order to directly compare with previous results for the @xmath19-@xmath20 model .",
    "as seen , @xmath86 is small and also decreases towards half filling , even approaching zero for low doping .",
    "this is highly advantageous for achieving the mixed chirality state , since the af moment is largest at half filling .",
    "in fact , when comparing to the calculated magnetic moment in ref .",
    "[ ] ( dashed line ) , we conclude that the mixed chirality state appears in a very large part of the phase diagram .",
    "we also see little variation with @xmath87 , making the mixed chirality state robust .",
    "having established the existence of a critical magnetic moment for entering the mixed chirality state , we now analyze the phase transition itself . for transparency we will from now on use the renormalized parameters @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : pt](b ) we plot the bond ops as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the perfect @xmath65 solution at @xmath54 , with equal parts of @xmath59- and @xmath15-wave character ( inset ) , becomes a slightly imperfect @xmath65 state for @xmath88 , since the imaginary part of the bond ops is somewhat suppressed at finite @xmath16 .",
    "however , as long as the imaginary part of the bond op is finite chirality is preserved . at @xmath18",
    "there is a sudden jump in the bond ops , where the imaginary part disappears and the real part increases , such that the @xmath59-wave character of the bond op jumps from 0.56 to 1 with only a 0.6% change in the magnetization at @xmath18 .",
    "this large discontinuous change of the op at @xmath18 is accompanied by a similarly discontinuous derivative in the free energy , strongly supporting a first order phase transition between the chiral @xmath0-wave state and the mixed chirality @xmath0-wave state .",
    "the phase transition to the mixed chirality state is driven by minimizing the number of low - lying quasiparticle excitations .",
    "the mixed chirality state is always fully gapped , with the gap increasing with @xmath16 , whereas the chiral state develops low - energy quasiparticle excitations at finite @xmath16 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : syms ] .",
    "however , the phase transition takes place well before the chiral @xmath0-wave state develops zero - energy states .",
    "thus , the system remains fully gapped in the whole af - sc coexistence phase , , as then the normal - state fermi surface only consists of the @xmath67 points .",
    "] although it is possible that domain wall proliferation might mask the energy gap .",
    "the fully gapped bulk energy spectrum is very interesting because of the topological nature of the phase transition . at @xmath54",
    ", the chiral @xmath0-wave state belongs to symmetry class c , as it has full spin - rotation symmetry @xcite .",
    "the c classification allows for @xmath89 different topological states in 2d . however , as soon as we add the af moment , only rotations around @xmath90 are left invariant .",
    "this results in symmetry class a for finite @xmath16 , which also has @xmath89 topological classification @xcite .",
    "the chiral @xmath0-wave state is therefore always classified by a @xmath91 winding number . on the other hand , the mixed chirality state at @xmath92 has opposite op windings in the two valleys .",
    "thus , while it is topologically nontrivial in each valley , the topological invariant cancels when summed over the full brillouin zone .",
    "the phase transition at @xmath18 is therefore a topological phase transition between two topologically distinct phases of matter .",
    "topological phase transitions have widely been assumed to require the bulk energy gap to close , as that is the only generic way to change topological order @xcite .",
    "the topological transition between the chiral and the mixed chirality @xmath0-wave states provides an explicit counterexample .",
    "this is possible because the topological transition is the result of a first - order transition within the ginzburg - landau paradigm .",
    "a defining property of topological states is the existence of edge modes , with the bulk - boundary correspondence equaling the number of edge states with the change of topological number at the edge @xcite . to investigate the edge band structure we solve self - consistently for the sc ops at every site in a thick ribbon . for @xmath93",
    "the dirac valleys at @xmath94 each give rise to one state per edge , see fig .",
    "[ fig : edge](a ) , which are copropagating in agreement with the change of topological number at the edge .",
    "the figure shows the result for zigzag edges , but armchair edges behave very similarly @xcite . at @xmath95",
    "the direction of the edge states at @xmath71 changes discontinuously due to the first - order transition , and the edge states instead become counterpropagating reflecting the mixed chirality , see fig .",
    "[ fig : edge](b ) .    reducing the width of the ribbon",
    "allows the study of finite size effects .",
    "we find @xmath18 to be significantly reduced in all but very thick ribbons .",
    "for example , in a @xmath96 , @xmath97 ribbon , perfect chiral @xmath0-wave symmetry is reached already within @xmath98 unit cells from the edge .",
    "still , @xmath99 in a ribbon 100 unit cells thick , compared to @xmath100 in the bulk .",
    "thus , ribbons provide a route for inducing the mixed chirality state below the bulk @xmath18 .",
    "for very thin ribbons we find that the phase transition is not sharply defined , instead there is gradual suppression of the imaginary part of the bond ops as @xmath16 increases .",
    "reducing the ribbon thickness also hybridizes left and right edge states .",
    "this is a scattering process within each dirac valley , which gaps the edge state spectra in both phases .",
    "we find no notable difference between the thin ribbon energy gaps deep inside the chiral and the mixed chirality @xmath0-wave phases , see fig .  [",
    "fig : edge](c ) .",
    "however , for @xmath101 low - lying bulk excitations exist at @xmath71 , resulting in a larger gap at @xmath71 just prior to the phase transition .",
    "finally , we study the effect of disorder .",
    "we find no influence of weak to moderate disorder on @xmath18 .",
    "the two chiral @xmath0-wave edge states are topologically protected and also not sensitive to disorder @xcite .",
    "the mixed chirality edge states are locally protected in each valley and thus only intervalley scattering can open a back - scattering channel .",
    "intervalley scattering only exists for atomically sharp disorder , and can be relatively rare in clean samples .",
    "still , we can demonstrate the sensitivity to intervalley scattering by using strong anderson disorder ;  an atomically strongly fluctuating chemical potential @xmath102 , with @xmath103 distributed randomly within the interval @xmath104 $ ] .",
    "we create disordered samples by using a @xmath105 long ( perpendicular to edges ) ribbon supercell , which reduces the 1d brillouin zone to @xmath106 $ ] . with the supercell momentum always preserved ,",
    "intervalley scattering is only present for edge states centered at @xmath107 .",
    "although this sounds as if it requires fine tuning , we find that strong disorder often locks the edge state to @xmath108 , as exemplified in fig .  [",
    "fig : edge](d ) .",
    "while the clean system has its zero - energy crossing located away from @xmath108 , strong disorder gives a small gap ( @xmath109 of the sc energy gap ) in the edge state centered at @xmath108 .    in summary ,",
    "we have found a mixed chirality @xmath0-wave sc state in the af - sc coexistence region in strongly correlated honeycomb materials . at a finite af moment",
    "there is a first - order topological phase transition from the chiral to the mixed chirality @xmath0-wave sc state .",
    "the mixed chirality state hosts two counterpropagating edge modes , protected in the absence of intervalley scattering .",
    "general rg and energy arguments make our results valid beyond the @xmath19-@xmath20 model . newly developed numerical approaches for",
