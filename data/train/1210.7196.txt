    "the collapse transition of a polymer in a dilute solution has been a continuing focus of study in lattice statistical mechanics for decades @xcite .",
    "this transition describes the change in the scaling of the polymer with length that occurs as the temperature is lowered . at high temperatures the radius of gyration of polymer scales in a way swollen relative to a random walk :",
    "this is known as the excluded volume effect . at low temperatures",
    "a polymer condenses into dense , usually disordered , globule , with a much smaller radius of gyration .",
    "the interest in this phase transition has occurred both because of the motivation of physical systems but also because of the study of integrable cases @xcite of lattice models have proved especially fruitful in two dimensions .",
    "while the canonical lattice model of the configurations of a polymer in solution has been the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) , where a random walk on a lattice is not allowed to visit a lattice site more than once , an alternative has been to use bond - avoiding walks , or a self - avoiding trail . a self - avoiding trail ( sat )",
    "is a lattice walk configuration where the excluded volume is obtained by preventing the walk from visiting the same bond , rather than the same site , more than once .",
    "the model of sat was used initially to model polymers with loops @xcite but has subsequently occurred in integrable loop models in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "a model of collapsing polymers can be constructed starting from self - avoiding trails , known as interacting self - avoiding trails ( isat ) . here",
    "energies are associated with multiply - visited sites , and by favouring configurations with many such sites a collapse transition can be initiated .",
    "owczarek and prellberg studied numerically the isat collapse on the square lattice by two different approaches @xcite and in either case found a strong continuous transition with specific heat exponent @xmath1 .",
    "recently , on the triangular lattice doukas _ _ et al.__@xcite found that by changing the weighting of doubly and triply visited sites a first - order transition can ensue or alternatively , depending on the ratio of these weightings , a weaker second - order transition that mimics the collapse found in the canonical interacting self - avoiding walk ( isaw ) model ( also known as the @xmath0-point ) .",
    "they also found that the low temperature phase becomes fully dense rather than globular , depending on the choice of parameters .",
    "recently , foster @xcite generalised the isat model on the square lattice by differentiating the type of doubly visited sites on the square lattice : a doubly visited site can be visited twice with the trail passing through itself , that is _ crossing _ , at the site , or alternatively as a result of two bends in the trail so that the trail  touches \" or  collides \" : see fig .",

    "we find for the visaw ( @xmath108 ) and the _ colliding _ model ( @xmath109 ) exponent estimates compatible with that of symmetric isat collapse at this length .",
    "this is a crucial result as it confirms the prediction of foster @xcite that the universality class of isat extends from @xmath67 to other values of @xmath68 .",
    "we see that an attempted estimate of @xmath106 for the _ crossing _ model over the full range of lengths is compromised by poor simulation results .",
    "nevertheless there is clear curvature in the data and the estimate decreases with length .",
    "using data from around length @xmath110 onwards gives an estimate of 0.08 .",
    "given that this estimate would most likely decrease even further with increasing length , it is likely that the data is compatible with the behaviour of the @xmath0-point interacting saw collapse transition ; this has a negative value of the exponent @xmath35 .",
    "therefore our data indicates that the isat universality class extends to a range values of the parameter @xmath68 measuring the asymmetry , as conjectured by foster @xcite . intriguingly , rather than becoming first order for @xmath68 near one as also conjectured in @xcite , the transition becomes weaker and potentially @xmath0-like as @xmath68 increases towards one .",
    "to further investigate the proposition that changing the asymmetry over a range around @xmath68 does not affect the nature of the collapse , except potentially near @xmath68 near 1 , we examine the low temperature phase .",
    "this approach proved fruitful in the case of triangular lattice extended isat @xcite where the low temperature phase could be either globular or fully dense .",
    "the fully dense low temperature phase seems associated with either the isat universality class or a first - order transition , while the globular phase is associated with the much weaker ( non - divergent specific heat ) isaw ( @xmath0-point ) collapse transition universality class .",
    "here we present evidence that for the square lattice symmetric isat , _ colliding _ and visaw models the low - temperature phase is maximally dense , and that the density jumps discontinuously at the critical point . on the other hand for the _ crossing _ model the low temperature phase seems not to be fully dense .",
    "this would be compatible with the conjecture that the collapse transition for the _ crossing _ model is @xmath0-point - like from a swollen phase at high temperatures to a globular phase at low temperatures .",
    "we have considered two different approaches to measuring the density .",
    "the first is indirect by measuring the proportion of sites of the lattice visited only once by the trail , and the second is using the radius of gyration to estimate the internal density of the polymer .",
    "both lead to the same conclusions .      following the analysis in @xcite we first measured the proportion @xmath111 of sites of the lattice visited only once by the trail .",
    "this provides a useful method for considering how dense our configurations are on average since an asymptotic value of zero would imply that effectively all the sites occupied by the trail are doubly occupied .",
    "double occupation of lattice sites implies that the surrounding edges of the lattice are all occupied with bonds of the trail : hence the lattice is filled by the trail as the trail increases in length . at high temperatures it is easy to see that @xmath111 approaches a finite strictly positive value in the thermodynamic limit :",
    "this is connected with the swollen nature of the polymer as seen in the radius of gyration scaling .",
    "one would expect on physical grounds that @xmath112 would be a monotonically increasing function of temperature @xmath113 .",
    "the question that arises is whether at low temperatures this value is zero and what kind of singularity occurs in @xmath112 at the collapse transition .",
    "it is worth considering first what happens at the collapse point itself in the symmetric isat model .",
    "thanks to the mapping between critical isat and kinetic growth trails we know that critical limiting value for @xmath111 is exactly 1/5 @xcite .",
    "the argument goes as follows : consider the case when a trail has formed a large @xmath5-step loop which occupies @xmath114 lattice sites ( this is always the case as trails do not trap ) .",
    "any site of this loop could have been the starting point . in order for this site to be visited only once , the loop must have closed at the first return visit , which occurs with a probability of @xmath115 . therefore we find for large loops @xmath116 , from whence it follows @xmath117 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_p ] ( a ) , we plotted @xmath111 against @xmath118 at the estimated critical temperatures of our four sub - models .",
    "we have used @xmath119 as the appropriate correction to scaling exponent from the estimated exponents for the symmetric isat model with @xmath120 .",
    "for the symmetric isat , _ colliding _ and",
    "visaw model this choice seems appropriate ; in each case the estimated value of @xmath121 is close to @xmath122 .",
    "while the correction to scaling exponent may not be appropriate for the _ crossing _ model it is clear that any estimate of @xmath121 is greater than @xmath122 .    for low temperatures ,",
    "as discussed above , if the trail fills the lattice asymptotically in a fully dense phase the portion of monomers of the trail not involved with doubly - visited sites of the lattice should tend to zero as @xmath123 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_p ] ( b ) , we plotted @xmath111 against @xmath124 for our four sub - models .",
    "the plots suggest that for the symmetric isat , _ colliding _ and visaw model , @xmath125 as @xmath123 in the low - temperature region , which implies a maximally - dense phase : our extrapolation estimates for @xmath121 have error bars encompassing zero .",
    "the _ crossing _ model seems to show a different behavior : our data suggest that @xmath111 tends to a non - zero value ( around @xmath126 )    these results form a clear picture in which the quantity @xmath121 jumps discontinuously to zero at the critical temperature for the symmetric isat , _ colliding _ and visaw models .",
    "in contrast , for the _ crossing _ model @xmath121 remains non - zero for all temperatures . in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_p_tau ] , we have plotted the quantity @xmath111 at different length scales as a function of the temperature . the plots again suggest a common discontinuous behavior for the last three models , while the crossing model seems to show a continuous transition in line with the extrapolations described in the previous paragraph .",
    "these findings support the result of the specific heat analysis , namely that the universality classes of the symmetric isat , _ colliding _ and visaw models are likely to be the same , while the _ crossing _ model is clearly in a distinct universality class .",
    "a more direct way of measuring of the density is to consider the quantity @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the radius of gyration of the polymer .    for any aisat in the high temperature phase",
    "we expect @xmath129 with @xmath130 , as for saws and sat , and therefore @xmath131 . from @xcite we know that at critical point of the symmetric model @xmath132 , so the density @xmath133 is zero also at the critical point . for all our models in the collapsed phase",
    "we expect that @xmath134 is non - zero at low temperatures .",
    "the natural question that arises is whether @xmath134 increases from zero at @xmath43 as the temperature is lowered in a continuous fashion , or whether it jumps discontinuously to a fixed maximum value at soon as the temperature is smaller than @xmath19 , being then constant for all @xmath135 .    if we take our results for @xmath111 as a guide we would expect that for the isat , the _ colliding _ and visaw models @xmath134 the density would jump discontinuously on decreasing @xmath113 below @xmath19 while for the _ crossing _ model @xmath134 would increases continuously from zero as @xmath113 is lowered through @xmath19 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : density_rho ] we plotted @xmath136 as a function of the temperature . in the symmetric isat , _ colliding _ and visaw models the density plotted for different lengths cross at a boltzmann weight close to the expected collapse transition point , increasing to the right and decreasing to the left . as argued above , the curves converge to zero for small boltzmann weights ( high temperatures ) and are consistent with an increase to a temperature - independent constant for large boltzmann weights ( low temperatures ) .",
    "this is consistent with the behaviour of @xmath111 discussed previously .",
    "the _ crossing _ model seems to have a different behavior .",
    "consistent with a varying limiting value of @xmath111 , the limiting value of the density @xmath137 does not approach a temperature - independent constant , either .",
    "we have studied a generalised model of interacting self - avoiding trails ( isat ) on the square lattice as proposed by foster @xcite where the weight associated with crossing - type interactions ( @xmath3 ) and collision - type interactions ( @xmath2 ) may differ .    from our analysis , we can confirm the conjecture in @xcite that the isat universality class extends over a region of asymmetry around @xmath138 .",
    "we can conclude that this region extends down to @xmath81 , which is also known as the visaw model , and seems extends to some larger @xmath139 .",
    "our simulation results for @xmath140 are compromised numerically by poor convergence : in fact at small lengths we see some evidence of multiply peaked probability distributions but these seem to become unimodal at larger lengths .",
    "importantly , the peak of the specific heat seems to decrease on increasing @xmath141 .",
    "indeed the specific heat of the @xmath140 model diverges with an effective exponent that is much smaller ( albeit with large error bars ) than the isat universality class would predict and , in fact , the specific heat may not diverge : we would expect a more strongly diverging specific heat if a first - order transition occurs . supporting these conclusions",
    "is our investigation of the low temperature phase for different asymmetry . for the symmetric isat and the visaw model the low temperature phase seems to be fully dense as it is in the extended triangular lattice model in certain regimes . also , in agreement with our tentative prediction for the @xmath140 case is the evidence that here the low temperature phase is no longer fully dense , which implies a globular isaw - like low temperature phase . putting this information together leads us to predict a @xmath0-point - like collapse as occurs in interacting self - avoiding walks for @xmath142 sufficiently large .",
    "further numerical work is clearly needed to pin down the large @xmath142 behaviour of the aisat model , including where the change of universality class occurs",
    ". finally , we point out that our evidence that the low temperature phase is fully dense for symmetric isat implies that there is a first - order characteristic of this transition , as predicted by foster @xcite , even though there is no latent heat .",
