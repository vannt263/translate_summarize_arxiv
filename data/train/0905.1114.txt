    "the transit of an extrasolar planet across the face of its host star allows direct measurement of the bulk properties of the planet . in particular",
    ", the transit allows accurate determination of the planet s radius ( see for example charbonneau et al . 2006 and references within ) .",
    "when these radii are combined with radial velocity ( rv ) measurements of masses then densities of the transiting extrasolar planets can be calculated .",
    "knowledge of the heating from the star allows estimates of the temperatures of the irradiated planets .",
    "models of the bulk properties of these planets can be compared to observation ( see for example baraffe et al .",
    "2008 ; fortney et al . 2007 ; burrows et al . 2007 ; seager et al . 2007 ) .",
    "while some 59 transiting extrasolar planets are now known , only 3 have masses less than 10% of jupiter ( closer to neptune in mass ) .",
    "the first transiting super neptune was gj 436b which was discovered around a m2.5 star at 0.028 au by an rv survey of butler et al .",
    "they found it had a mass of @xmath821 @xmath9 .",
    "follow - up photometric observations of gj 436b then discovered it to be a @xmath87 - 8 millimag ( @xmath80.7% ) transiting planet ( gillon et al .",
    "further follow - up measurements find a radius of @xmath10 ( torres , winn & holman 2008 ; bean et al .",
    "2008 ; respectively ) and a density of @xmath11 ( torres 2008 ) . through these transit observations and modeling by baraffe et al .",
    "( 2008 ) it has been determined that gj 436b is mainly composed of metals with only a small h / he envelope .",
    "the second transiting neptune discovered was hat - p-11b , in orbit around hat - p-11 ( 2mass 19505021 + 4804508 ) a k4 ( v=9.6 mag ) metal rich star .",
    "this planet was discovered by the hatnet array of small 0.11 m telescopes on mt .",
    "hopkins in arizona ( bakos et al . 2009 ) . at just 4.2 millimag ( mmag )",
    "hat - p-11b was the smallest planet discovered by the transit method . moreover , bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) argue that compared to recent measurements of the radius of gj 436b , hat - p-11b was at the time the smallest transiting extrasolar planet known .",
    "however , the corot team has announced the discovery of corot-7b which is smaller still with just 1.7 @xmath12 ( rouan et al .",
    "2009 ) . in any case , transiting objects of less than 0.1 @xmath13 number no more than three today and start to probe densities and masses closer to terrestrial in contrast to lower density gas giants composed mainly of a large h / he envelope .    in the case of hat - p-11b , detailed rv measurements by bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) show a linear drift ( @xmath14 m / s / day ) in the rv residual of hat - p-11 .",
    "this drift is possibly due to the pull of an additional unseen planet in the system ( bakos et al .",
    "in addition , bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) determine a non - zero ( 0.198@xmath150.046 ) eccentricity which might be maintained by interactions with another planet .",
    "both observations hint at the presence of another outer planet `` hat - p-11c '' in the system .",
    "indeed , most systems with super neptunes are multiple planet systems ( bakos et al . 2009 and references within ) .",
    "however , it is worth noting that to date no transiting planet is known to be a member of a multiple planet system .",
    "hence , detection of multiple transiting planet system would be very interesting .",
    "continued rv monitoring of this system may directly detect curvature in the rv residuals due to this outer planet . another way to directly detect the presence of a possible `` hat - p-11c",
    "'' would be a sensitive search for transit timing variations over a series of hat - p-11b transits .",
    "a search to bound the magnitude of such timing variations motivated this paper .",
    "data was taken at the university of arizona s 61-inch ( 1.55 m ) kuiper telescope on mt .",
    "bigelow , arizona on 1 may , 2009 ut with the mont4k ccd , binned 3x3 to 0.43@xmath16/pix . observing a single transit of hat - p-11b at high s / n is fairly challenging , since the transit depth is just @xmath8 4.3 mmag , hat - p-11 itself is a very bright @xmath17 = 9.6 magnitude k4 star with a nearby faint ( likely background ) star , the surrounding `` kepler field '' is somewhat crowded , and all of the potential photometric reference stars are several magnitudes fainter than hat - p-11 .",
    "defocusing was not possible , due to the crowded field and the difficulty of maintaining a consistent focus offset with this telescope / instrument combination . in order to take long enough exposures to sufficiently average out atmospheric scintillation noise ,",
    "while still avoiding saturation of the ccd , we used a medium bandwidth stromgren b filter ( @xmath1818.0 nm ) .",
    "the mont4k filter holder and filter sensor position were specifically modified to accommodate the thicker stromgren filter for our observations .",
    "the conditions were photometric with light wind and no moon throughout the observational period . in total 448 images",
    "were obtained with @xmath19 pixels of wander , due to excellent autoguiding .",
    "integration times of 20  s were used at the start when the target was still at relatively high airmass . just prior to the start of the transit ( after the @xmath20 image )",
    ", the exposure times were reset to 17  s , giving a sampling time of 28.3  s for the remainder of the observations .",
    "the relatively fast overhead time is achieved mainly by binning 3x3 and skipping the flushing of the ccd after each readout and before the subsequent exposure in the sequence , but is also a product of the mont4k s design , which includes two amplifiers and pre - amplifiers .",
    "the images were bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and bad pixel - cleaned in the usual manner .",
    "aperture photometry and sky subtraction was performed for the target star and three reference stars using the aperture photometry task phot in the iraf daophot package .",
    "an aperture radius of 4.3@xmath16 ( 10.0 pixels ) was adopted , as it produced the smallest scatter in the light curve and also eliminated contamination from hat - p-11 s nearby companion , which is 5.4 magnitudes fainter in b and 8.9@xmath16 to the nne ( at a position angle of 9@xmath21 ) .",
    "the reference stars are 2.3 to 2.65 magnitudes fainter than hat - p-11 , and were chosen to be distributed as uniformly as possible about the target star on the sky ( they formed a triangle around hat - p-11 at distances of 89 , 208 , @xmath22 from hat - p-11 ) .",
    "the reference stars were normalized to unity and then weighted according to their average fluxes .",
    "we applied no sigma clipping rejection to the reference stars or hat - p-11b all datapoints were used in the analysis .",
    "the final light curve for hat - p-11 was normalized by division of the weighted average of the three reference stars .",
    "the residual light curve in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom left ) has a photometric rms range of 1.7 mmag rms and a time sampling of 29 seconds on average .",
    "this is very typical of the relative photometric precision achieved with the mont4k on the 61-inch ( kuiper ) telescope for high s / n images ( randall et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ; dittmann et al .",
    "the planetary transit light curves were fit using the @xmath23 method prescribed by mandel and agol ( 2002 ) .",
    "the transit hat - p-11b parameters used in the fit were those in table 1 measured by bakos et al .",
    "the correct linear and quadratic limb darkening parameters for our b filter were taken from claret ( 2000 ) . in order to detect any transit timing variations the only parameter that was allowed to vary in the fit was the central time of of the transit , @xmath24 .",
    "the time of the center of this transit , ( @xmath24 ) , is shown near the bottom of table 1 .",
    "we note that the purpose of this section of the paper was not to re - derive all the parameters of the transit but to understand if our transit is consistent with the period of bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    to measure @xmath24 we minimized @xmath23 to find a @xmath25 bjd value ( the flux uncertainty for each datapoint in the @xmath23 fit was calculated from the propagation of the photometric errors determined with the phot task ) .",
    "the @xmath26 day @xmath27 uncertainty was estimated by monte - carlo simulations of 1000 simulated datasets with the same 1.7 mmag rms scatter of the original data ( see fig",
    ". 2 left ) .      to try and understand if our transit data suggest a different planetary radius for hat - p-11 we repeated the fit in the last section using the @xmath23 method prescribed by mandel and agol ( 2002 ) but this time allowed the planetary radius @xmath28 to vary along with @xmath24 . in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) we see the result of our fit ( solid red line ) and the residuals of this fit below .",
    "to measure @xmath29 we further minimized the reduced @xmath30 to 1.06 with simultaneous fits of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath33 @xmath27 uncertainty in @xmath29 was estimated by monte - carlo simulations of 1000 fake datasets with the same 1.7 mmag rms scatter as the original data ( see fig . 2 right ) .",
    "a key goal of this paper is to compare our measured may 1 , 2009 ut @xmath24 to that predicted from the previously measured values . projecting the p=@xmath34 day period of bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) forward from their most accurate @xmath35 transit suggests that our may 1 transit ( @xmath36=71 periods later ) occurred @xmath37 seconds sooner ( where @xmath38 was calculated by @xmath39 ) than our observed @xmath40 bjd was predicted to be .",
    "however , the significance of this disagreement is small .",
    "indeed there is @xmath860% probability that our observations are fully consistent with the timing measurements ( and uncertainties ) of bakos et al .",
    "certainly , we can rule out large @xmath2 second timing errors at the @xmath41 level .    with the addition of our new @xmath24 values to the two previous values",
    "we derive a new p=@xmath42 day value for the period of hat - p-11b ( based on a sigma weighted average ; see table 1 ) .",
    "this new value is slightly shorter than the p=@xmath34 day period of bakos et al .",
    ". however , it will require future observations to determine if this new period will better predict future transit times .",
    "it is entirely possible that all of our transit timing values are consistent with predictions from bakos et al.s ephemeris within measurement errors .",
    "moreover , one can calculate that the period estimate between the @xmath24 measurements over the first 284 orbits of bakos et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and over the last 71 orbits has only changed by @xmath43 seconds .",
    "hence , there is no significant evidence , with the data in hand , that hat - p-11b s period has changed over the last 0.95 year compared to the previous 3.79 years .    in general , it is difficult with a single additional transit to confidently determine if the discovery period of bakos et al .",
    "is changing with time .",
    "our @xmath44 datapoint 71 orbits later yields a more accurate period of p=@xmath42 day . this new period with its lower error can be used to construct a standard o - c ( observed minus calculated time - of - transit ) diagram which will start showing `` non - linear '' trends in the future o - c residuals if the period is truly changing .",
    "our observations of the depth of the transit finds a deeper transit and a @xmath31 compared to @xmath45 of bakos et al .",
    "we find that @xmath29 is @xmath46 larger than that of bakos et al .",
    "hence , there is a significant probability that our transit was deeper than that of bakos et al .",
    "we derive a slightly larger planetary radius of @xmath47 @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) compared to bakos et al.s values of @xmath6 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "our values suggest that hat - p-11b is very similar to gj 436b in radius .",
    "we confirm the existence of the transiting planet hat - p-11b .",
    "our main conclusions from our 1.7 mmag rms ( unbinned ) transit observations ( with the university of arizona s 1.55 kuiper telescope ) of the may 1 , 2009 ut transit are :    \\1 .",
    "we find a central transit time of @xmath0 bjd from a best fit to our data .",
    "we estimate that the transit occurred @xmath1 seconds sooner than previous ( 71 orbits in the past ) measurements would have predicted ( bakos et al .",
    "our finding is consistent with the ephemeris of bakos et al .",
    "and rules out the presence of any large timing variation .",
    "we derive a slightly larger planetary radius of @xmath47 @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) compared to bakos et al.s values of @xmath6 ( @xmath50 ) .",
