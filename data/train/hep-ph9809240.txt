    "one of the main purposes for constructing a hadron supercollider is to discover the mechanism responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "a large amount of attention has been devoted recently to the ability of detecting a higgs boson at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "gluon fusion is the main mechanism of producing higgs bosons at the lhc , and if a cp - even higgs scalar is sufficiently heavy it can decay into @xmath4 boson pairs . in the standard model ,",
    "this is a useful detection channel for the higgs boson with a mass @xmath5 since the @xmath6 coupling grows with higgs boson mass .",
    "the physical higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model ( mssm ) is comprised of two cp - even states , a lighter @xmath7 and a heavier @xmath1 , one cp - odd state , @xmath8 , and two charged higgs bosons @xmath9 .",
    "the higgs potential is constrained by supersymmetry such that all tree - level higgs boson masses and couplings are determined by just two independent parameters , commonly chosen to be the mass of the cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath10 ) and the ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of higgs fields ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the cp - even states can couple to the @xmath12 final state at the tree level , but only the heavier one ( @xmath1 ) can be massive enough to decay into on - shell @xmath4 bosons . for @xmath13 , discovery of the mssm heavy higgs scalar in the @xmath12 channel could be problematic due to the fact that the higgs couplings to the gauge bosons arise from the d - term contributions to the scalar potential . as the @xmath1 becomes heavy , its coupling with the gauge bosons becomes smaller .",
    "previous studies have found that the production rate for @xmath14 is large enough to make this channel a viable one for higgs detection provided @xmath11 is relatively small ( @xmath15 ) and that the higgs boson is not too heavy ( @xmath16  gev ) @xcite .",
    "the impact of supersymmetric decay modes has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ) has been studied in increasing detail in the last few years , with much attention devoted to the standard model higgs boson or to the lighter mssm higgs scalar , @xmath7 .",
    "the impact of squark loops in the production process has been included , and the impact of squark mixing has been investigated @xcite .",
    "the qcd corrections to the production process have been calculated and shown to give a large enhancement to the cross section @xcite .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the dominant background to the channel @xmath20 in the standard model is @xmath21 , and the one - loop continuum production of @xmath4 pairs via quark loops , @xmath22 . in the mssm",
    "the existence of the scalar partners to the quarks gives a new contribution to the continuum production that can interfere with the quark loops and possibly affect the overall level of background .",
    "if the masses of the squarks are much larger than the electroweak scale , their contributions to the signal should be small as their mass arises from soft terms rather than from the higgs mechanism . for squarks with masses comparable to the electroweak scale , significant contributions to the higgs production signal",
    "might be expected .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the squark loops can have a significant impact on the production cross section if the squarks are fairly light .",
    "therefore , a natural step is to also investigate the impact of the squark loops on the background .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the background coming from squark loops to the higgs signal in the channel @xmath2 is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "since only the third generation gives a sizable contribution to the resonant higgs contribution @xmath23 , one might expect an important contribution from the continuum background for which all three generation squarks are expected to contribute .",
    "the central issue concerning the detectability of the higgs boson is whether the squark loop contribution can be comparable to the quark loop contribution for energies near the higgs mass .",
    "the squark loop contribution is maximal near the production threshold ( @xmath24 ) , so we are most interested in the size of the squark loop background for @xmath25 .",
    "another potential application of the process under consideration is a measurement of the @xmath26 coupling .",
    "the production mechanism involves a coupling to the higgs boson ( a yukawa coupling ) that implies that only the third generation matter make a sizeable contribution to the rate .",
    "each generation contributes equally to the background ( assuming equal masses for squarks in different generations ) , so potentially there is an enhancement as there is in the case of quark loops .",
    "a large background from squark loops could conceivably alter the regions of parameter space ( the @xmath27 plane ) for which the heavy higgs can be discovered .",
    "the gluon coupling to the higgs boson is mediated by triangle graphs .",
    "the calculation of the background involves box graphs and is significantly more complicated than that of the higgs production cross section .",
    "the one - loop integrals , which are expressible in terms of spence functions ( dilogarithms ) @xcite , were evaluated numerically using a fortran code @xcite .",
    "we have not included squark mixing in this first survey , and leave the more general case to a future paper @xcite .",
    "however we do not expect squark mixing to have a significant effect on the cross sections . while the cross section for the resonant higgs graphs can be significantly increased by an enhanced @xmath28 coupling @xcite ,",
    "squark mixing results only in mixing angle factors in the couplings of squarks to the @xmath4 bosons and splits the degeneracy of the squark masses for the nonresonant graphs .",
    "one expects an enhanced contribution only from the loops involving @xmath29 squarks which might have a suppressed mass with significant mixing .",
    "if the lightest squark is less than half the mass of the higgs boson , then the higgs boson can decay into squark pairs making the higgs broader and more difficult to detect in the @xmath12 final state .",

    "in this section we compare the size of the squark loop background with that arising from the quark loops . in the standard model ,",
    "only quark loops contribute to the production of @xmath12 from gluon fusion @xmath0 . in the mssm",
    "there are additional contributions from squark loops , which typically are thought to be suppressed by large squark mass . in this section",

    "we plot the invariant mass distribution @xmath36 from @xmath0 via the squark loops in the mssm , assuming their masses are all degenerate at values of 100  gev , 300  gev and 500  gev .",
    "the lightest squark considered is excluded by the tevatron data @xcite , but we include it for comparison purposes . there is a rapid rise in the cross section until the threshold of real squark pair production after which the cross section falls again .",
    "since the squark loop cross section peaks at @xmath37 , the largest contribution to the background from the squarks comes at subprocess ( @xmath22 ) energies slightly below the squark production threshold .",
    "the contribution to @xmath22 from graphs with squark loops not involving the higgs boson is separately gauge invariant , and the cross section falls off rapidly as @xmath38 increases . in figure 3",
    "we show the squark loop cross section for the polarization states @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the @xmath12 final state . the contribution from squark loops is always smaller than that from quark loops even for squarks as light as 100  gev .",
    "the transversely polarized case dominates over the other modes for the squark loops just as it does for the contributions from the quark loops .",
    "= 4.5 in    = 4.5 in",
    "some contributions to the one - loop amplitudes for squark loops given in the appendix are closely related to parts of the helicity amplitudes for the quark loops .",

    "one can also compare the contributions from fermion loops in the process @xmath45@xcite to the contribution that was obtained later for the gauge boson loops @xcite .",
    "however the most numerically significant contributions to the cross section is often those contributions that are not given by the supersymmetric relationship .",
    "in fact the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath46 ) is governed by the spin of the particles exchanged in the @xmath47- and @xmath48-channels . for example , one has the dominance of the @xmath49 boson loops over fermion loops in the process @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "the differential cross section appears the same apart from the size of the higgs boson resonance .",
    "= 4.5 in    an interesting property of the quark loop amplitudes is the cancellation of the higgs graphs with the box diagrams which can be related to the good high energy behavior of @xmath58 .",
    "the relative sign between the triangle and the box diagrams has been checked with the unitarity condition .",
    "we can cut the loop diagrams and obtain the tree processes @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "unitarity then requires a cancellation among tree diagrams at high energy .",
    "no such cancellation is required for the scalar loops between diagrams with and without higgs bosons .",

    "6 we have plotted the contributions to @xmath22 including both the resonant higgs graphs and the nonresonant graphs for @xmath54 and 10 including both the quark loops and the squark loops . the background from squark loops can be safely neglected around the higgs pole region .",
    "the @xmath1 resonance exhibits destructive interference just below the peak .",
    "this arises from interference with the contribution from the diagrams involving the light higgs boson @xmath7 .",
    "this feature is present for squark loops alone and also for quark loops alone , and should be present in nonsupersymmetric extensions of the standard model with extended higgs sectors . in the mssm it seems unlikely that this interference dip can be seen experimentally given the size of the underlying background .",
    "we note that the contributions to @xmath22 from squarks loops without higgs bosons are also valid in nonminimal supersymmetric models since they do not involve contributions from the higgs sector .",
    "the basic features that arise from the numerical calculations are that the squark production cross section peak near the real production thresholds , @xmath37 . this enhancement should be smoothed somewhat after the inclusion of qcd corrections .",
    "the overall level of the squark loop contribution is much smaller than that of the quark loops , and even after including the interference between the two contributions we find that the squark loops can always be safely neglected in an overall estimate of the background level .    in fig .  7 , we present the invariant mass distribution of @xmath12 including the higgs signal from gluon fusion and the irreducible background from @xmath60 annihilation and @xmath61 fusion via quark and squark loops in @xmath62 collisions , with a rapidity cut @xmath63 , for @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . for the smaller values of @xmath67 near 2",

    "the `` silver - plated '' mode @xmath71 might also be used , and has a rate six times that of the gold - plated mode , but reducible @xmath4-jet backgrounds might be a problem @xcite . if real squarks can be produced the higgs width becomes larger , the higgs peak in the invariant mass of @xmath12 is reduced and the event rate is too small to discover the higgs . even if we choose squarks with a mass such that the squark contribution peaks near the higgs pole , the contribution to the continuum background from the squark loops is negligible .",
    "= 4.5 in    we expect that the squark loop background is also negligible for higgs bosons with masses @xmath72 , so that at least one of the @xmath4 bosons is virtual @xmath73 .",

    "the calculation @xmath74 has been performed for the quark loops in ref .",
    "@xcite , and that background falls rapidly for invariant masses decreasing below the @xmath12 threshold .",
    "we expect the squark loops to be negligible in this case as well , but our calculation is applicable only for real @xmath4 bosons .",
    "we have calculated the contribution from squark loops to the process @xmath22 at the lhc .",
    "we find that they are substantially smaller than the contribution from quark loops , and can usually be safely neglected in computation of the continuum background in the higgs search . in models with two cp - even higgs bosons , we have also shown the amplitudes involving the heavy higgs boson interferes destructively just below the resonance with the contributions from the light higgs bosons .",
    "the expressions for the helicity amplitudes given in the appendix can be easily adapted to give the squark loop contributions to the processes @xmath75 , @xmath44 and @xmath50 .",
