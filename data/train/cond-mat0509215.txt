    "both functions have a notch in the middle .",
    "the notch in the bosonic function is wider than that in the fermionic function . in this case",
    "the fermionic nonlinearity ( 1275 ) is large .",
    "consequently , the extension of the fermionic function in figure 1 ( a ) is also much larger than the bosonic function .    one way to observe the dark solitons",
    "experimentally is to allow them to expand freely while the central notch will become wider in size to be visible and photographed . with this in mind",
    "we study the free expansion of the boson - fermion mixture .",
    "the snapshots of the bosonic and fermionic functions at regular intervals of time during this expansion are shown in figures 1 ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "after expansion , the central notch in the bosonic dark soliton expands as we find from figure 1 ( b ) but the notch in the fermionic dark soliton in figure 1 ( c ) does not expand enough to be visible .",
    "this will make the fermionic dark soliton more difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "however , this behavior is quite expected in a freely expanding fermionic dark soliton with a large nonlinear repulsion . in the fermionic equation",
    "both the fermion - fermion and fermion - boson interactions are highly repulsive .",
    "the dark soliton has a notch ( hollow region ) at the center .",
    "because of the very strong repulsion , the dfg tends to expand in all directions including the radially inward direction to fill the central hollow space as well as outward directions .",
    "this inward repulsive force balances partially the outwards kinetic pressure and does not allow the central notch to expand substantially during free expansion so as to be easily observable .",
    "this is not the case for a moderately repulsive or attractive pure single - component bec , where the outward kinetic pressure overcomes any repulsion among the atoms and the bec expands only in the radially outward direction with a widening of the notch . in the bosonic wave function of figure 1 ( b )",
    "the notch expands reasonably during the expansion of the bec .",
    "however , during the expansion in figures 1 ( b ) and ( c ) the central notch of both the bosonic and fermionic condensates has always a zero at the origin .",
    "next we study the stability of the solitons illustrated in figures 1 under a small perturbation inflicted by a sudden change in the boson - fermion scattering length @xmath131 .",
    "after the solitons of figures 1 are formed we increase @xmath131 by 10@xmath132 at @xmath133 so that the nonlinearities @xmath125 and @xmath126 are suddenly increased from 40 to 44 .",
    "this can be performed experimentally by varying a background magnetic field near a feshbach resonance in the boson - fermion system @xcite .",
    "the solitons then execute small breathing oscillation around a mean position . the snapshot of the soliton profiles shown in figures 3 ( a ) and ( b ) under this perturbation demonstrates their stability .",
    "finally , we calculate the dark solitons in the boson - fermion mixture with the parameters of figure 1 ( a ) in the presence of an optical - lattice potential with @xmath134 we plot in figure 3 the function @xmath135 for the dark soliton in this case .",
    "the presence of the optical - lattice potential creates modulations in both fermionic and bosonic functions .",
    "because of the very strong repulsion , the fermions tend to occupy the whole available region in space and do not allow the formation of pronounced notches with hollow region inside at each optical - lattice site .",
    "consequently , the modulation in the fermionic function is less pronounced than the modulation in the bosonic function .",
    "the bosonic function of figure 3 has pronounced notches compared to the smooth function in figure 1 ( a ) , whereas the fermionic function of figure 3 with small modulations is qualitatively more similar to the fermionic component of figure 1 ( a ) .",
    "we also studied free expansion of the dark solitons in this case .",
    "the central notch in the fermionic dark soliton does not also expand in this case .",
    "no new interesting physics emerges and the results are not shown here .",
    "we use a coupled set of time - dependent mean - field - hydrodynamic equations for a trapped degenerate boson - fermion mixture to study the formation of a fermionic dark soliton ( vibrational excitation ) in a dfg as stationary states .",
    "we calculate the stationary functions with a notch at the center for fermionic dark soliton of the boson - fermion mixture .",
    "the existence of a central notch in the wave function for a dark soliton is typical of vibrational excitation .",
    "we perform numerical simulation of the dark solitons for a harmonic as well as a harmonic plus optical - lattice traps .",
    "the simulation is started with a time evolution of the mean - field equations with the eigenfunction of the lowest excited state of the linear oscillator problem setting all the nonlinearities to zero .",
    "the nonlinearities are introduced slowly during time evolution and the iteration continued until convergence is obtained .",
    "we demonstrate the stability of the dark soliton upon the application of a perturbation while the soliton executes small breathing oscillation .",
    "the present time - dependent formulation also permits us to study non - equilibrium free expansion of the coupled degenerate boson - fermion mixture .",
    "one way to observe the notch experimentally is to allow the dark soliton to undergo free expansion .",
    "we find that for a repulsive boson - fermion interaction , after a free expansion the notch in the fermion function for a relatively small fermion number of 100 does not increase in size significantly so as to be easily observable .    in the present investigation we used a set of mean - field equations for the dfg - bec mixture .",
    "a proper treatment of the dfg should be performed using a fully antisymmetrized many - body slater determinant wave function @xcite .",
    "although we believe the present conclusion about fermionic dark soliton to be true in general , it would be of interest to establish their existence using such a fully antisymmetrized fermionic many - body wave function in the future .",
    "also , a dark soliton features a particular spatial phase distribution , i.e. a step of @xmath136 phase . in a bec , this phase profile",
    "is supported due to the macroscopic phase of the condensate .",
    "although a macroscopic phase of the fermionic component should emerge in the present mean - field model , to the best of our knowledge its existence in a fermionic many - body wave function has not been established rigorously .",
    "however , such a study is beyond the scope of this paper and would be a work of future interest .",
    "nevertheless , it would be proper to call the fermionic excitation of the present paper by the term dark soliton due to its appropriate density distribution with a central notch .",
    "the work is supported in part by the cnpq of brazil ."
