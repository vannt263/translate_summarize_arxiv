    "in lab - on - a - chip technology , the high hydrodynamic resistance the liquid experiences as it flows in a network of micrometric channels often imposes the microfluidic device to be connected to pumping systems thousands of times bigger than the chip itself , thereby erasing many advantages of a millimeter - sized device . in this respect ,",
    "superhydrophobic surfaces ( shs ) have demonstrated to be an effective tool to relax the constraint of no - moving liquid at the channel walls@xcite , due to air pockets trapped in surface cavities ( the so - called cassie or fakir state ) .",
    "air bubbles durably reside in the surface roughness only under specific conditions of pressure and surface wettability@xcite .",
    "when the cassie state is no longer stable , the meniscus collapses within the cavities@xcite and the liquid is in contact with the entire exposed surface of the solid ( the so - called wenzel state ) . in literature ,",
    "the experimental measurements of water slippage past shs , usually characterized in terms of effective slip length@xcite , spread over a quite broad data range which spans from hundreds of nanometers@xcite to few hundreds of micrometers@xcite .",
    "slight discrepancies between measurements and theoretical predictions are also reported and mainly ascribed to experimental factors which can not always be easily controlled or quantified .",
    "one of those is certainly the meniscus deformation@xcite resulting from the balance of liquid pressure and surface tension . theoretical@xcite and",
    "numerical@xcite studies have demonstrated the negative impact of the meniscus curvature and position on the effective slip length .",
    "such a detrimental effect has been confirmed by experimental investigations of shs characterized via several techniques like confocal microscopy@xcite , micro particle image velocimetry ( @xmath0-piv)@xcite , pressure versus flow rate measurements@xcite and dynamic surface force apparatus@xcite .",
    "similar results were also reported by numerical analysis via continuum models@xcite , molecular dynamics@xcite and lattice - boltzmann simulations@xcite .",
    "very recently , a superhydrophobic microfluidic device with active control of the meniscus shape has been presented@xcite . through numerical and experimental investigations ,",
    "the authors showed how the resulting effective slip length could be tuned and optimized by controlling the protrusion depth of the meniscus into the flow .",
    "another phenomenon which might be responsible for a dramatic increase in the apparent surface friction , but has not yet received adequate attention in the study of shs , is the fact that a water - air interface can not always be treated as a stress free boundary . in that respect ,",
    "there are quite few experimental evidences@xcite showing that at the micrometer scale partial - slip or even no - slip assumptions can be more appropriate , in some circumstances , for modelling water - air interface under experimental conditions .",
    "lazouskaya et al.@xcite were the first to report a reduced mobility at the liquid - air interface in an open capillary channel , questioning the validity of the no - shear boundary condition at the meniscus interface .",
    "more recently , the same research group performed new experiments with a very similar geometry@xcite and highlighted the dependence of an effective interfacial shear stress on the channel dimensions .",
    "particularly , for channel width below the water capillary length ( i.e. 2.7 mm ) , the interfacial shear stress increases as the channel size decreases . investigating the speed of the advancing meniscus flooding an open hydrophilic channel , yang et al.@xcite found a good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions when a no - slip boundary condition was assumed at the liquid - air interface . since the benefits of shs in terms of friction reduction rely on the presence of stress - free boundaries , it is essential to probe whether or not the liquid - air interfaces can always be considered as a perfect slip interface . in this paper",
    ", we fully characterize the flow past a silicon micro - grooved surface and we specifically focus our attention on the interfacial friction behaviour of the liquid - air interfaces . however , discriminating between the effects of a deformed meniscus , on one side , and the interfacial friction at the liquid - air interface , on the other side , is not an easy task as this requires measuring the flow nearby the meniscus while simultaneously determining its shape and position .",
    "experimental configurations to probe both the liquid flow and the meniscus deformation has been recently introduced@xcite . for all those studies ,",
    "the direction normal to the shs has to be co - planar to the microscope focal plane .",
    "this necessarily limits the experimental investigation to one single surface geometry , that is the one with micro - grooves perpendicular to the flow direction .",
    "micro - structured surfaces with micro - grooves parallel to the flow direction or with pillars and holes would be much more difficult to be studied in that experimental configuration . in this respect , we recently developed a novel technique@xcite to perform simultaneous velocity and interface profile measurements on shs .",
    "that technique has no restriction on the shs orientation and it has been successfully used to study even very complicated surface pattern like ellipse - shaped pillars .",
    "we now adopt such a technique to characterize the interfacial friction of a water flow past a silicon surface with longitudinal micro - grooves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dshs ] ) .",
    "we first investigate the slippage of the shs globally by measuring the effective slip length of the velocity profile averaged over a surface pitch .",
    "we then focus on the local interfacial friction and we evaluate the friction contributions of the liquid - solid and liquid - air interfaces , separately . by correlating the flow with the actual meniscus profile",
    ", we eventually determine what boundary condition best describes the liquid - air interface behaviour .",
    "to best of our knowledge , such a strict test of the local boundary conditions at the liquid - air interfaces for micro - structured shs has never been performed so far .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief description of the experimental set - up and procedures , the microfluidic device and the velocity and interface profile measurement techniques we used for characterizing the slippage at the superhydrophobic surface .",
    "a detailed presentation of those methods are reported elsewhere@xcite .      a nikon eclipse te 2000-u inverted microscope , equipped with a water immersion @xmath1 ( na @xmath2 ) objective ,",
    "is used to capture fluorescence images of the flow inside the microfluidic chip fed by a flow control system ( fluigent mfcs - flex ) .",
    "a dpss laser ( cni mll532 , @xmath3mw at @xmath4 nm ) excites red fluorescent @xmath5 m diameter polystyrene microspheres , dispersed in a ultrapure milli - q water flow ( @xmath6 solid concentration ) .",
    "the fluorescent particles act as passive tracers for tracking both the velocity and the liquid - air and liquid - solid interface profiles .",
    "a ccd camera ( allied vision technologies ) records the light emitted by the tracers at a frame rate of 200hz .",
    "an acousto - optic - modulator ( aa optoelectronics mt80 ) periodically deflects the laser beam so that the camera sensor is exposed to the beam light for @xmath7s only .",
    "we used a silicon superhydrophobic surface ( si - shs ) , patterned with longitudinal microgrooves , @xmath8 m in width and @xmath9 m in depth , evenly spaced by @xmath8 m ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dshs ] ) . to prevent in case of a wenzel transition",
    "the cavities being flooded along the whole channel length , the grooves are sectioned in smaller grooves @xmath10 mm in length , separated each other by transverse @xmath11 m thick walls , as highlighted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3dshs ] .",
    "the si - shs is first oxidized by oxygen plasma treatment and then silanized via standard vapor deposition of 1h,1h,2h,2h - perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane ; 97% ( abcr ) to promote a stable cassie state .",
    "the channel is finally assembled by clamping together the si - shs with a microscope cover slip covered with a pdms film about @xmath12 m in thickness . a @xmath13mm@xmath14 mm area was previously engraved on the pdms film .",
    "the resulting channel is then @xmath15 mm long , @xmath13 mm wide and @xmath12 m deep@xcite . because of the high aspect - ratio of the cross - section , the confinement effects on the fluid flow are negligible .      using @xmath0-piv  cross - correlation analysis of sets of images recorded at different focal planes@xcite , we determined the velocity profile throughout the channel depth .",
    "the number @xmath16 of images per plane is chosen so that at the minimum detectable speed ( about @xmath12 m/s ) the brownian motion component of tracer velocity is negligible ( less than @xmath17 ) with respect to the average component . as a consequence of that@xcite",
    ", we recorded @xmath18 frames at focal planes nearby the silicon surface and @xmath19 anywhere else .    a reference coordinate system as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dshs ] is adopted .",
    "the @xmath20 coordinate axis is parallel to the optical axis and positively oriented from the surface to the cover slip .",
    "its origin is at the liquid - solid interface . the @xmath21 and @xmath22 axes are parallel and transverse to the flow direction , respectively .",
    "the axial step of the objective position is @xmath5 m in the bulk and @xmath23 m close to the plane @xmath24 .",
    "processing algorithms are implemented via custom matlab codes .",
    "we recently introduced a novel technique@xcite to measure the liquid - air and liquid - solid interface relative positions and shapes with a resolution of tens of nanometers .",
    "such a measurement is performed by post - processing the same fluorescent microscopy images used for the @xmath0-piv  velocity analysis .",
    "consequently , the velocity and interface profiles can be simultaneously determined with a single channel scan .",
    "the method is based on the detection of the excluded volume , namely the region next to the interface which is not accessible to the moving colloids .",
    "this volume is determined by splitting the fluorescent images in overlapping rectangular interrogation windows and , then , measuring for each window the intensity of the fluorescent light emitted by the flowing tracers as a function of axial position .",
    "nearby the interfaces , the intensity versus axial position plot can be fitted to a shifted error function .",
    "the inflection point of the best - fit function can be reasonably assumed as the center of those colloids which flowed closest to the interfaces , namely the boundary of the excluded volume . by assembling data from all interrogation windows ,",
    "a 3d reconstruction of the excluded volume boundary can be performed in the whole field of view of the microscope objective . that boundary provides the relative position and the shape of both liquid - air and liquid - solid interfaces . by considering the thickness of the depletion layer",
    ", the absolute position of both interfaces can be retrieved with the diameter of the passive tracers being a good estimate for the accuracy of such a measurement .",
    "we have also introduced@xcite an additional liquid - solid interface detection algorithm , which is in good agreement with the previous one .",
    "such a method is capable of measuring the absolute axial position of a solid wall with nanometer accuracy , provided the wall reflects the light emitted by the tracers .",
    "this is the case for a silicon flat surface which , acting as mirror , lets us track both the real and virtual ( reflected ) images of the tracers .",
    "the resulting velocity profiles are then symmetric with respect to the position where flow velocity vanishes to zero .",
    "the solid wall is then detected by locating the axes of symmetry of those profiles .",
    "a fine localization of the solid walls is necessary for high quality characterization of the slippage .",
    "for such a task , we adopt the reflection - based interface detection scheme since it can locate the absolute position of the liquid - solid interfaces more accurately than the excluded - volume based one .",
    "standard microfluidic cleaning procedures were adopted for manufacturing the chip and preparing the solution .",
    "microfluidic chip fabrication and oxygen plasma treatment were performed in class iso 7 cleanroom .",
    "silane vapor deposition was done inside a desiccator placed under a chemical fume hood whereas the chip was assembled on a laboratory worktop .",
    "the solution of milli - q water and colloids was prepared and stored using clean plastic disposable vials , syringe and needles . to prevent the accumulation of fluorescent colloids on the si - shs",
    ", the silicon surface was cleaned via acetone ultrasonic bath and rinsed with di water before reusing it .",
    "microfluidic tubings and fittings were frequently cleaned with a mixture of di water and ethanol first and then washed with di water only . for cleaning and safety reasons ,",
    "gloves were worn at all the time during sample preparation and experiments .",
    "slippage occurs at liquid - gas and liquid - solid interfaces whenever the tangential component of the liquid velocity at the interface appears to be different from the one of the other phase ( either solid or gas ) .",
    "that velocity gap between the two phases is called slip velocity . a well known quantity which has been used to characterize",
    "the slippage is the slip length @xmath25 defined as the ratio between the slip velocity and the shear rate at the interface@xcite .",
    "when the slip length is experimentally estimated by averaging an appropriate measurement over a length scale much larger than the molecular scale , we rather refer to it as effective slip length . for structured surfaces consisting of a periodic array of liquid - air and liquid - solid interfaces ,",
    "if the measurement is averaged over one array pitch , we refer to it as global effective slip length .",
    "conversely , if the slip length is measured just on a pitch fraction , like the liquid - air or the liquid - solid interface only , we denote it as local effective slip length . in the next sections ,",
    "we characterize the slippage of the examined si - shs by determining both the global and the local effective slip lengths .",
    "we first assess the overall performance of our device by measuring the global effective slip length at the si - shs .",
    "fluorescent images are acquired with a scan along the channel depth from @xmath26 m to @xmath27 m .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we recall that the origin of the @xmath20 axis is fixed at the liquid - solid interface of the si - shs",
    ". the streamwise velocity profile is averaged over the microscope field of view in the flow ( y ) direction and over a surface pitch , consisting of one liquid - solid and one liquid - air area , in the transverse ( x ) direction .",
    "the resulting profile is fitted to that one @xmath28 predicted by the one - dimensional ( 1d ) model of a pressure driven flow with a sticky wall at @xmath29 ( i.e. the cover slip ) and a partially slippery wall at @xmath24 ( i.e. the si - shs ) with global effective slip length @xmath30 .",
    "the parameter @xmath31 stands for the channel depth .",
    "the analytical expression for @xmath28 reads @xmath32 } {   h^2 ( 2b_{gl } + h)^2   } \\label{eq : partial_slip}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the peak velocity .",
    "the fit parameters are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth noting that the channel depth parameter @xmath31 has to be fitted because we could not apply the reflection - based liquid - solid detection technique at the cover slip wall z=@xmath31 . indeed",
    "the reflection coefficient of glass is too low to accurately track the virtual images of the colloids flowing next to the glass wall .",
    "additionally , due to the elasticity of pdms , the channel depth might change between experiments as it depends on the clamping force which keeps together the pdms - coated cover slip and the si - shs .",
    "the measurements were performed in two different spots of the device .",
    "we refers to those measurements with the labels m1 and m2 . between m1 and m2 ,",
    "the microchannel was disassembled , cleaned and reassembled .",
    "[ fig : vel_prof ] shows the experimental profiles @xmath28 and the corresponding best - fit curves .",
    "the best - fit parameters are reported in table [ tab : param ] together with the fit uncertainties .",
    "it is worth recalling that in our system we do not control the geometry of the liquid - air interface and thus the meniscus can freely adapt its shape and position according to the local experimental conditions . as a consequence of that , there is no reason for the menisci to share the same shapes and positions between measurements m1 and m2 .",
    ".best - fit parameters and corresponding uncertainties for the 1d model , see eq.([eq : partial_slip ] ) , for measurements m1 and m2 : peak velocity @xmath33 , channel depth @xmath31 , global effective slip length @xmath30 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     for both m1 and m2 , non - zero interfacial shear stresses appear at the menisci , which turn out to be , within the accuracy of the measurements , closer to no - slip interfaces rather than no - shear ones",
    ".      performing simultaneous interface and velocity profile measurements with our technique reveals that the assumption of a no - shear boundary condition at the liquid - air interface is not valid for the examined shs .",
    "that is the reason why the predicted global effective slippage of eq.([eq : philip ] ) is much higher than the measured values .",
    "if instead we consider a model where the stress - free boundary condition is replaced with a low partial - slip ( namely , @xmath35 ) , the corresponding global effective slip length can be estimated through the following heuristic formula@xcite @xmath36 according to this model , for @xmath37 the expected global slip length is @xmath38 whereas we measured values of @xmath30 larger than @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "table  [ tab : param ] and table  [ tab : param3 ] ) . in order to explain the observed behaviour",
    ", we must take into account the actual profile of the menisci .",
    "[ fig : int_prof ] shows that the menisci are essentially flat .",
    "consequently , in our experiments any detrimental effect induced by the meniscus curvature@xcite on the global slippage is negligible . on the other hand ,",
    "the menisci are not co - planar with the liquid - solid interfaces as it is assumed in the model , but they partially penetrate the surface cavities . since the liquid - air interfaces are almost immobilised ( i.e. @xmath40 ) , the partial flooding of the cavities is responsible for an apparent positive global effective slippage , namely @xmath41 . had been the meniscus directed towards the flow , we would have measured a negative global effective slip length . additionally , the fact that the position of the menisci can vary along the surface sample accounts for the observation of an apparent inhomogeneity of the surface slippage .",
    "the difference between global effective slippages in m1 and m2 is about 40% and so it is the difference between the corresponding penetration depths of the menisci .",
    "the possible causes behind the onset of an interfacial friction at the liquid - air interface for the examined sample are several .",
    "the presence of contaminant particles within the flow is one of those .",
    "more specifically , the liquid - air interface is confined in a @xmath10mm@xmath42 m rectangular region , consisting of two adjacent grooves and two consecutive transverse @xmath43 m thick walls ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3dshs ] ) .",
    "consequently , contaminant particles could be adsorbed onto the liquid - air interface and pushed by the liquid flow against the downstream transverse wall .",
    "that would result in a particle concentration gradient and , possibly , marangoni stresses which oppose the water flow nearby the meniscus , causing higher friction at the interface@xcite .",
    "possible agents acting as surface contaminants could be either pdms molecules coming from the channel walls or unknown surfactant molecules used by the supplier in the preparation of the fluorescent polystyrene colloids or even the colloids themselves . in that respect ,",
    "it is worth noting that experiments involving the use of shs are usually performed following standard microfluidic cleaning procedures .",
    "as detailed in the section  [ sec : methods ] , we followed those procedures and we did not implement any other specialized cleaning protocol to control the level of contamination of the liquid - air interfaces .",
    "alternative to the surface contamination scenario , we remind that marangoni stresses could also raise from @xmath0-piv  laser - induced thermal effects . a detailed investigation about the actual causes behind the measured interfacial friction at the meniscus",
    "are beyond the scope of this research .",
    "in the present paper , we applied our novel velocity and interface detection technique to thoroughly characterize the slippage behaviour of a silicon micro - grooved superhydrophobic surface .",
    "we first investigated the global slippage capability by averaging the velocity profiles along a periodic array consisting of one liquid - air and one liquid - solid interface .",
    "the surface performances were much lower than expected when modelling the surface as a periodic pattern of co - planar no - shear and no - slip parallel stripes .",
    "in addition , the surface shows an inhomogeneous behaviour when slippage is probed in different spots of the samples . to better clarify the discrepancy with the theory",
    ", we evaluated the interfacial friction at the liquid - solid and liquid - air interfaces by measuring the meniscus profiles and relating them to the flow nearby . in doing so",
    ", we were able to probe the actual boundary condition at the deformed meniscus and we find out that the liquid - air interface is not behaving like a no - shear boundary , as it is usually assumed in the studies of shs .",
    "unexpectedly , the global slippage of the examined si - shs is a mere consequence of almost no - slip menisci protruding within the surface cavities . due to the impossibility to control the meniscus geometry ,",
    "the global slippage varies along the sample according to the local shape and position of the menisci . in conclusion",
    ", we reported for the first time the violation under specific circumstances of the widely common assumption of stress - free boundary at the liquid - air interfaces in micro - structured shs .",
    "we showed that even in presence of a stable cassie state , the friction reduction capabilities of shs can be seriously compromised when interfacial stresses appears at the liquid - air interfaces .",
    "we proved that those potential detrimental effects in terms of low slippage can be as worse as those deriving from a deformed meniscus protruding into the flow@xcite .",
    "consequently , the presence of non - deformed ( i.e. flat ) liquid - air interfaces in the cavities of a shs can no longer be considered a sufficient condition to guarantee significant surface friction reduction .",
