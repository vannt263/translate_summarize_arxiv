    "the primary energy estimation method is one of the clue features to deal with using extensive air shower ( eas ) technique of ultra - high energy cosmic ray measurements . in this paper",
    "we discuss the present status of algorithms used to assign the primary energy to showers detected with the yakutsk array .",
    "special attention is paid to the total flux measurement of the cherenkov light on the ground which is the basis of the model - independent approach to the energy evaluation of eas original particle .",
    "the uncertainty limits of the energy estimation method are analyzed .",
    "resulting energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the region surrounding gzk energy @xmath3 ev has the form consistent with the prediction of greisen @xcite and zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite .",
    "one more eas event at energy above @xmath4 ev has been detected with the yakutsk array 18 february 2004 .",
    "an updated lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of charged particles was used in data analysis which leads to increased @xmath5 parameter in average . as the result",
    "we have 3 showers of energy greater than @xmath4 ev detected in yakutsk to present day .",
    "actually , the yakutsk array has two kinds of triggers to select the showers from the background : produced by cherenkov light detectors and by the scintillators .",
    "we will describe here the latter one ; in the case of coincident signal ( particle density @xmath6 ) in two scintillators of each station within 2 microseconds the signal passes on to the central controller .",
    "trigger-500 is then produced in the case of coincident signal ( in 40 @xmath7s ) from three or more stations at @xmath8 m spacing .",
    "similarly , trigger-1000 is produced by @xmath9 kilometer spacing stations .",
    "after 1992 when 18 new stations were added , the array area is increased from @xmath10 to @xmath11 where trigger-500 operates .",
    "that is why we can deal with the spectrum in the energy range from @xmath12 ev to @xmath1 ev using the same trigger .    in our previous analysis the lateral distribution of charged particles",
    "was approximated by greisen s formula @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 ;    here we use another approximation given earlier @xcite : @xmath15 where parameter @xmath16 has the value given in table  [ table : index ] , and @xmath17 is additionally adjusted ;    which has been shown to describe better the experimental points at large core distances @xmath18 m. as a result , the charged particle density at 600 m from the core , @xmath5 , is increased by @xmath19 for showers above @xmath20 ev with axes inside array perimeter , and by @xmath21 outside .",
    ".lateral distribution index [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : t1000x ]    at the highest energies our intensities became closer to agasa data , but gzk cutoff feature is different .",
    "the slope of the spectrum above @xmath4 ev seems rising in the case of the yakutsk array data as well as for hires spectrum ; on the contrary , agasa data exhibit no cutoff .",
    "but the probability to detect three or less events above @xmath4 ev in yakutsk is 15% , while 6 events are expected according to agasa s intensity .",
    "therefore , it seems that one has to wait until auger / ta data in order to decide whether there is the gzk cutoff or not .",
    "in addition to the charged particle detection on the ground , we have another technique at the yakutsk array - the air cherenkov light measurement , which can be used to draw out the cr spectrum in independent way  @xcite .",
    "these two spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrcher ] covering the wide energy region from @xmath22 to @xmath4 ev .",
    "the cherenkov detector sub - array is covering only about @xmath23 km@xmath24 area , so it is convenient at energies @xmath25 , while scintillator stations can measure the spectrum above this limit . at the low energy threshold of the main array @xmath26",
    "ev we have a discrepancy in intensity measured using two methods .",
    "this may be caused by @xmath27 uncertainty increasing in the vicinity of the threshold .",
    "two features of the measured spectrum - a knee ( at @xmath28 ev ) and dip around @xmath29 ev can be explained in the model of anomalous diffusion of galactic cosmic rays in fractal interstellar medium  @xcite . in this model",
    "the mass composition is predicted in the energy range @xmath30 ev ; eas maximum depth vs. energy is simulated by corsika v.6.0 code using qgsjet model assumptions . resulting spectra of the primary nuclei groups",
    "are shown by curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrcher ] , together with the total spectrum marked all.",
    "we have measured the energy spectrum of cosmic rays below and surrounding the gzk cutoff region .",
    "air cherenkov light measurements provide us the model - independent approach to the primary energy estimation using the total light flux connected to the ionization loss of electrons in atmosphere .",
    "other appreciable energy fractions are evaluated on the basis of the total number measurement of electrons and muons on the ground .",
    "an updated function to approximate the lateral distribution of charged particles leads to increased average density @xmath5 . as a result",
    ", we have three showers detected with energies above @xmath4 ev including a new event detected 18.02.04 . two energy spectra measured with the yakutsk array",
    "cover the range @xmath22 to @xmath31 ev and exhibit the knee and dip features in agreement with other arrays .",
    "the spectrum tail above @xmath32 is consistent with the gzk cutoff contrary to agasa result , although the statistical significance of this conclusion is insufficient due to a few showers detected above @xmath4 ev .",
    "we are grateful to the yakutsk array staff for the essential contribution to data acquisition and analysis .",
