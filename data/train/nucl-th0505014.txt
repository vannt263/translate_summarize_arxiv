    "the discovery of the medium effects on jets produced at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) has contributed greatly to the understanding of the physics underlying hard partons traversing a hot and dense quark - gluon system@xcite .",
    "subsequently , a large number of experimental investigations have revealed details of the properties of jets , both on the near side and on the away side , in heavy - ion collisions ( hic ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "particle correlations within jets are shown to have distinctive properties in the azimuthal angles @xmath1 and in pseudorapidities @xmath0 of the associated particles .",
    "of particular noteworthiness is the peak in @xmath8 between the @xmath0 values of the trigger and the associated particles on the near side : it sits above a flat plateau or a pedestal @xcite .",
    "no pedestal is found in @xmath9 , although a peak in that variable is prominent .",
    "it is our aim in this paper to study the peaks and pedestal in @xmath9 and @xmath8 and to discuss the physical origins of these jet characteristics .",
    "our approach to the problem of correlation between particles in jets will be based on parton recombination that has been shown to be successful in reproducing the single - particle distributions in au+au collisions @xcite , and in d+au collisions @xcite .",
    "it has also been applied to the study of dihadron correlations @xcite . however , since those investigations were carried out in the framework of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) formulation of the recombination model , a generalization to account for the 3d geometry of the problem is necessary if we are to describe the features in the @xmath1 and @xmath0 variables .",
    "once we consider the 3d aspects of jets the angular distribution of the shower partons in the jet cone becomes an important new feature .",
    "our treatment will be phenomenological , since no results from perturbative qcd considerations can reliably be applied to the intermediate @xmath4 region , which is where the data on correlations are taken .",
    "furthermore , the pedestal phenomenon suggests that the jet interacts with the environment in a way that is sensitive to the hydrodynamical expansion of the medium , since there is longitudinal expansion , but not azimuthal expansion .",
    "it turns out that we can relate the pedestal to the local enhancement of the thermal bath due to the energy loss of the hard parton to the medium .",
    "our approach to the problem , though not based on first principles , provides the first theoretical interpretation of the pedestal and peak structure of the jets produced at rhic in quantitative terms .",
    "the roles that shower and thermal partons play in the hadronization process are found to be crucial and can not be reinterpreted in any other model that we are aware of .    in sec .  2 we describe how the 3d properties of jets are incorporated in the recombination formalism .",
    "3 the pedestal phenomenon is investigated , followed by the study of the peaks in @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions in sec .  4 . the conclusion is given in the last section .",
    "in the framework of parton recombination formulated in 1d for particle production in hic @xcite-@xcite , let us start by writing down the single - and two - particle distributions @xmath10 @xmath11 where the recombination function ( rf ) for a pion is @xcite @xmath12 the two- and four - parton distributions , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , can be written in terms of their components as @xmath15 @xmath16 the thermal parton distribution is @xmath17 and the shower partons in a jet have the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the distribution of hard parton @xmath20 in a hic , and @xmath21 is the average fraction of hard partons that emerge from the thermal medium to hadronize .",

    "for the sake of clarity we have omitted the labels for parton species for @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the above equations and in what follows , except when the identity of a parton is needed for emphasis .",
    "it is important to recognize that eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) should not be applied to every @xmath26 that appears in eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 5 ] ) because all the shower partons in @xmath13 and @xmath14 are created in the same jet , so all the @xmath27 terms share the same hard parton with momentum @xmath28 .",
    "thus for two shower partons @xmath29 , their joint distribution is @xmath30 where the quantity in the curly brackets has the form in terms of momentum fractions @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 . \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is done to guarantee momentum conservation @xmath34 and to symmetrize the order of emission of the two partons . not only should eq .",

    "it is the structure in eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) that gives rise to correlation between two shower partons in a jet , and thereby endows the detected hadrons at high @xmath4 with correlation . however , that is sufficient primarily in the case of considering only the correlation among momentum magnitudes in 1d .    to generalize our consideration to 3d ,",
    "let us focus our attention first on the @xmath40 components in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) that give the most important contribution to the trigger and associated particles in central collision . to be specific",
    "let us further designate the trigger particle to be a @xmath41 and the associated particle to be a @xmath42 .",
    "the 3d expression for eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) in that case is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the 3d version of the rf and it includes the spatial coordinates .",
    "since recombining partons must not only have collinear momenta but also have overlapping wave functions , there are many narrow gaussian distributions in @xmath44 that reduce the phase space of integration .",
    "let us first restrict our attention to the @xmath45-@xmath46 plane , i.e.the plane containing the hard parton momentum @xmath47 and the longitudinal direction @xmath48 , and assume that all @xmath49 vectors are in that plane so that we may write @xmath50 and @xmath51 we further assume that @xmath52 is in the direction of @xmath47 and that the trigger momentum @xmath53 is also along @xmath47 . this is a simplification that does not compromise the angular correlation between the trigger and associated particles , which we shall study in detail .",
    "since @xmath44 requires the wave functions of the recombining partons to overlap , the shower and thermal partons at @xmath54 and @xmath55 should be nearby .",
    "these assumptions allow us to reduce the trigger momentum part of eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) to the usual 1d formulation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the usual rf in 1d , given in eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "the superscript @xmath58 on @xmath24 is omitted on the rhs since the flavor dependence of the thermal partons is negligible and ignored .",
    "we shall assume that at midrapidity , @xmath59 , the thermal distribution does not contain essential dependence on @xmath60 so that the condition @xmath61 does not lead to any restriction that would cause @xmath62 to deviate from the usual parameterization given in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) .    in the case of the associated particle we must recognize that the shower parton @xmath63 may be emitted at an angle @xmath64 relative to the hard parton momentum @xmath47 . since @xmath47 forms an angle @xmath65 with the @xmath46 axis ( after identifying the direction @xmath66 with @xmath67 )",
    ", we have @xmath68 the recombination of the shower parton at @xmath63 with a thermal parton at @xmath69 requires that they are not only collinear , but also overlapping spatially .",
    "there are therefore @xmath70-functions , @xmath71 , that force the momentum @xmath72 of the associated particle to be in the same direction as @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the corresponding 3d integrations result in @xmath75 this equation is very similar to eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) but with one crucial difference ; that is , the shower parton distribution now depends on @xmath64 . in eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) no angular dependence of the shower parton @xmath52 is assumed for simplicity , since it is only the difference between @xmath52 and @xmath63 that matters . that angular difference , @xmath64 , made explicit in eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) , is translated into the angular difference between @xmath53 and @xmath72 .",
    "we have tacitly assumed that the thermal partons have local angular spread that allows a @xmath76 to recombine with @xmath52 to form @xmath53 , and similarly @xmath69 with @xmath63 to form @xmath72 , in such a way that @xmath77 and @xmath78 are in the directions of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",

    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) we obtain with @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is to be identified with @xmath96",
    ".    we now can write eq .",

    "( [ 3 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) in the simpler form @xmath97 where @xmath20 is summed over all hard parton species .",
    "if @xmath20 is a valence quark of @xmath41 or @xmath42 , the corresponding spd is @xmath98 , while if @xmath20 is a sea quark , the corresponding spd is @xmath99 in the notation of @xcite , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 . the integral over @xmath28",
    "will , in practice , be from 3 to 30 gev / c , and @xmath102 will be integrated from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , although the formalism is not reliable for any transverse momentum less than 1 gev / c .",
    "there are other terms of @xmath14 contained in eq.([5 ] ) that can be written out as in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) , but will not be detailed here .",
    "the experimental procedure of making background subtraction involves multiple considerations , and the result is that there remains a residual pedestal in @xmath8 in central collisions , but no pedestal in @xmath105 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are differences in @xmath0 and @xmath1 between the associated particle and the trigger . in @xcite",
    "the dihadron correlation is calculated with the assumption that the factorizable part of the two - particle distribution corresponds to the background . that leaves only the @xmath106 terms of @xmath14 to consider .",
    "we now find that in order to understand the origin of the pedestal what constitutes the background must be reconsidered .",
    "the first point that we want to address is the effect of energy loss of hard partons traversing the hot medium .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 in eqs.([7 ] ) and ( [ 8 ] ) , being only 0.07 as determined in @xcite for central au+au collisions , implies that a large fraction of the hard partons produced are absorbed or attenuated by the bulk medium .",
    "those that emerge to hadronize outside must have been created near the surface . in the short distance",
    "that such a parton travels in the medium it must on average lose some energy and locally enhance the thermal motion of the partons in the environment .",
    "those enhanced thermal partons should have an effective inverse slope @xmath107 that is slightly higher ( by @xmath108 ) than that of the usual thermal partons not influenced by the passage of any hard partons .",
    "the latter corresponds to what is measured for the low-@xmath4 pions in single - particle distribution , which for @xmath109 gev / c has led to the determination of @xmath110 gev / c in @xcite . if @xmath108 is small , as we expect it to be , it does not make too much difference in the calculation of the single - particle distribution in the intermediate @xmath4 region .",
    "however , in principle , in thermal - shower recombination the shower partons recombine with the enhanced thermal partons that are in the immediate vicinity of the hard parton that creates the shower . to distinguish the two values of the inverse slope ,",
    "let us use @xmath107 to denote the one for the enhanced thermal parton , since that is the only physically relevant one for @xmath111 recombination , i.e. , it is what appears in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) for @xmath112 .",
    "let us use @xmath113 to denote the inverse slope for the thermal medium undisturbed by jet quenching , i.e. , @xmath114 gev / c .",
    "we define @xmath115 which is a parameter to be determined phenomenologically in this paper , although it can presumably be determined directly by dedicated experimentation",
    ". we shall relate @xmath108 to the pedestal .",
    "the physics involved is sensible , since the pedestal is seen only for central collisions where @xmath111 recombination is important . in peripheral collisions",
    "thermal partons play a minor role and there are few of them to be enhanced .",
    "we now give an argument why the pedestal is seen in @xmath8 , but not in @xmath9 .",
    "when a hard parton is first scattered or created at a large angle relative to the incident beam direction , the bulk medium is in a highly compressed state . as it expands longitudinally , the region of enhanced thermal partons expands with the whole system , although limited to the neighborhood of where the hard parton traverses the thin layer close to the surface .",
    "thus a section at midrapidity can have the enhanced @xmath107 . in the transverse plane ,",
    "on the other hand , the expansion is in the radial direction only ; that is , there is no mixing across different azimuthal sections .",
    "the subtraction scheme carried out by star @xcite defines the yield @xmath116 to be zero at @xmath117 after subtraction .",
    "since there is no expansion in the @xmath1 direction , we can take this subtraction scheme to imply that all thermal partons that are enhanced stay inside the @xmath118 region , and that for @xmath119 there is no thermal - thermal recombination that is not in the background .",
    "there may still be an enhancement of the yield inside the @xmath118 region that plays a role similar to the pedestal in @xmath8 , but it can not extend beyond @xmath120 by virtue of the subtraction scheme .",
    "the above description can not be demonstrated by a transport model , since we do not have a monte carlo code for the evolution process .",
    "however , the physical content of our discussion will be embodied in our quantitative formulation below .",
    "the recombination model actually provides a more transparent description of the hadronization process than what a code without reliable equations can offer .",
    "let us first consider the particles that are associated with a trigger . since in au+au collisions",
    "the @xmath111 component is dominant in the intermediate @xmath4 region @xcite , which includes the trigger window @xmath121 gev / c , we select the @xmath122 term in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) for our discussion below , although both terms in @xmath123 are included in our calculation .",
    "thus the parts of @xmath14 that contribute to the trigger and its associated particles are @xmath124 among the three terms on the right side it is clear that @xmath125 are directly related to the jet and contribute to the peak in the associated particle distribution ( apd ) , while @xmath126 does not involve the shower partons but can nevertheless contribute to the apd outside the peak .",
    "it is therefore our prime candidate for the pedestal .",
    "the absence of an obvious pedestal in the apd in @xmath105 is a consequence of the background subtraction scheme in the analysis of the experimental data , where the @xmath9 distribution at @xmath117 is identified to be the background . in our description of the apd the background corresponds to @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the thermal parton distribution in the absence of any hard partons , i.e. , @xmath129 the meaning of @xmath113",
    "has already been discussed in connection with eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "we have tacitly assumed that the normalization factor @xmath130 is unchanged from that in eq .",

    "we now define the apd with background subtracted to be generated by @xmath132 in which @xmath133 vanishes at @xmath134 , but need not be zero at @xmath118 .",
    "equation ( [ 26 ] ) is our basic input in the calculation of the apd .",

    "we change the differentiated variables to @xmath138 , with @xmath136 being used as a free reference point in the assemblage of the @xmath3 distribution ; the trigger @xmath95 is to be integrated over the trigger window @xmath139 .",

    "figure 1 shows the apd in @xmath8 . the solid line is the result of our calculation when we set @xmath205 evidently , it reproduces the data @xcite satisfactorily , both in the peak structure and the pedestal .",
    "it should be emphasized that although the width and the pedestal height are adjusted to fit by our choice of @xmath206 and @xmath108 , the height of the peak is a consequence of our very complicated calculation involving multiple integrals over many terms based on the recombination model .",
    "it is by no means trivial that the data can be fitted so well . in point of fact",
    ", we have only calculated @xmath207 production , whereas the data are for all charged particles .",
    "thus the precise values of the parameters are not as significant as the overall situation where the pedestal and peak structure of the @xmath173 distribution of the data can be reproduced by our description of dihadron correlation .",
    "turning now to the apd in @xmath9 , we have no free parameters to adjust , since the double differentials in the square brackets in eqs.([44 ] ) and ( [ 45 ] ) are identical . upon integration over @xmath173",
    "we obtain the solid line in fig .  2 , which compares well with the data @xcite .",
    "the dashed line indicates the pedestal contribution from eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "it plays the role of the flat pedestal in fig .  1 ,",
    "but here it vanishes at @xmath117 because of the subtraction scheme .",
    "since the peak structure in @xmath9 is much narrower than the broad mount of the pedestal ( due to @xmath208 ) , we have applied the vanishing condition at @xmath117 only to the @xmath209 component , knowing that the @xmath210 component is negligible at the wings of the peak .    figures 1 and 2 represent our main results on dihadron correlation in central au+au collisions at @xmath211 gev , when the trigger particle is kept within the range @xmath212 gev / c and the associated particle in the range @xmath213 gev / c .",
    "we can readily calculate the apd at higher momentum ranges , but not at lower momenta , since our model is not reliable for parton momentum less than 1 gev / c .",
    "for that reason we do not calculate the apd for @xmath214 gev / c , even though data for that range are presented in @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have successfully reproduced the data that show the existence of peaks in @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions , the former sitting above a flat pedestal , while the latter sitting above a broad mount .",
    "some parameters are used to fit the data , but the essence of our work is not data fitting .",
    "we have demonstrated that the physics underlying the detail structure of the jet characteristics observed in rhic experiments can be understood in the framework of parton recombination .",
    "jets produced in heavy - ion collisions create shower partons that are in the environment of thermal partons , which can themselves be enhanced by the passage of hard partons through the medium .",
    "that view is probably shared by all theoretical approaches to the problem .",
    "the issue then is how those partons hadronize .",
    "different models treat the hadronization process differently .",
    "our approach emphasizes the recombination of the thermal partons and the shower partons in the intermediate @xmath4 region . that is our way of accounting for the medium effects on jets .",
    "so far we have not encountered any obstacle in understanding the data in that way .",
    "data fitting is only a concrete demonstration that the details of the jet structure can be quantitatively reproduced in our treatment .",
    "the hadronization formalism is thereby enriched by the determination of some features in the model by phenomenology .",
    "our first discovery in this work is that the pedestal in the @xmath2 distribution can be related to @xmath108 in the local thermal distribution .",
    "no  long - range correlation \" has been put in by hand .",
    "the pedestal is a consequence of the recombination of the thermal partons among themselves , which are only indirectly affected by hard scattering through the enhancement of @xmath107 due to energy loss .",
    "thus the pedestal is not a part of the jet , but can not be present without a jet .",
    "this chain of successive connections involving energy loss , enhanced thermal partons , their hadronization by recombination , and the elevated apd in @xmath2 is certainly very different from a model where an explicit correlation is put in by hand .",
    "our second achievement in this work is the success in describing the peak structures in both @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions in terms of one angular distribution of the shower partons in a jet cone .",
    "short - range correlation \" has been put in by hand .",
    "the only primitive correlation in the problem is that which exists among the shower partons in a jet .",
    "the properties of that correlation in the momentum magnitudes of the shower partons have already been described in @xcite . here",
    "we show how the correlations manifest themselves in the angular variables of the produced pions .",
    "there is one caveat in our analysis that should be noted .",
    "we have calculated only @xmath207 production , whereas the data are on all charged hadrons .",
    "thus numerically the parameters determined here are not definitive .",
    "since particle identification is steadily being improved , the more appropriate arena for detailed matching of theory and experiment is when the data for the production of specific species become available .    despite the tentativeness of the value of @xmath108 given in eq.([38 ] ) on account of the statement made just above , our assertion that the pedestal is related to the enhancement of @xmath107 of the thermal partons remains unaffected . as a test of that assertion",
    "we propose that the proton associated with a @xmath41 trigger be measured in addition to the measurement of a @xmath41 or @xmath42 associated particle .",
    "the @xmath215 ratio of the associated particles in a @xmath41 triggered jet should be a good probe of the physical mechanism underlying both the pedestal and the peak .",
    "the recombination approach to the problem is well positioned to calculate that ratio , as it has for single - particle distribution @xcite .",
    "we surmise that the pedestal part of the @xmath215 ratio would be higher than in the single - particle case because @xmath216 .",
    "what we have done in this paper is influenced greatly by our intention to understand the pedestal and peak structure in the data of [ 3 ] . as a consequence ,",
    "our analysis involves many integrals that correspond to the experimental cuts in the data .",
    "having determined the origin of the pedestal and peaks in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 distributions , we are now equipped to launch a study of the correlation problem independent of any triggers and related experimental cuts , on which more and more data are becoming available .",
    "we have benefitted from discussions with x.  n.  wang and c.  b.yang in the preliminary stage of this work .",
