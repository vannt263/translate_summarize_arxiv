    "one of the simplest statistical indicators which characterizes the mass distribution in the universe is the mass function of cosmic structures . press and schechter ( 1974 , hereafter ps ) , have proposed a formalism to evaluate this function at any time . for a given hierarchical scenario of structure formation , as for instance cdm , the mass function is obtained using only the power spectrum of the initial density fluctuations .",
    "this formalism has been extensively tested with the help of numerical simulations .",
    "the first comparison between the mass function of dark - matter halos obtained in numerical simulations and that predicted in the framework of the ps approach have shown a satisfactory agreement ( @xcite ) .",
    "this agreement was later improved by imposing some ad  hoc modifications to the initial ps formalism ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , it was shown in these studies that the concordance between the numerical and the analytical predictions was improved by lowering the initial density threshold at which a spherical homogeneous region collapses .",
    "however , the theoretical reasons for which a quantity resulting from very non  linear dynamics , such as the mass function , can be computed from this formalism have never been clarified .",
    "this question takes on a greater importance because the ps formalism which is a powerful tool , is widely used in phenomenological analytical cosmology .",
    "it is , for example , very often used to put constraints on the cosmological parameters using either the luminosity function of galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , the temperature distribution of x - ray clusters ( @xcite , @xcite ) or the sunayev - zeldovich effect ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the mass function of cosmic structures obtained in the framework of the ps formalism has a * statistical * and * dynamical * origin .",
    "starting with the statistical properties of the initial density field , ps identify the fraction of mass embedded in collapsed objects of mass greater than a given mass m , with the fraction of volume filled with regions of space satisfying a given dynamical criterion .",
    "usually the criterion is simply issued from the spherical collapse which selects all the points whose initial density is above a certain threshold .",
    "it is highly probable that such a simple model is unable to describe the complex features occurring during a fully non ",
    "linear dynamical process .",
    "one can imagine that only a fraction of regions with a given density contrast exceeding the threshold eventually collapses .",
    "this `` fuzzy '' density criterion can be viewed as a statistical tool ( @xcite ) , but here , in order to have a better understanding of structure formation , we intend to derive it from the gravitational dynamics .    therefore , in this paper , we study the influence of non - linear dynamics on the mass function , highlighting the role played by shear and tidal effects on the actual shape of the mass function .",
    "we present analytical results which exhibit generic features of ps  like mass functions and show the relationship between the dynamics and the mass function through what we call a selection function .",
    "our study concerns both non - spherical lagrangian dynamical models , and some dynamical `` ansatz '' that we introduce to describe the structure formation beyond the usual validity range of lagrangian approximations . in a companion paper",
    "we compare our analytical predictions with numerical results .",
    "the analytical method which has been most successful up to now to compute the mass function is the one introduced by ps . in this paper",
    "we use such a formalism but we intend to give our own interpretation of this approach from a lagrangian point of view ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this gives us a general framework for computing the mass function .",
    "the idea of ps is to compute the number density of cosmological objects with mass @xmath1 at a given time , by identifying the fraction of mass contained in these objects with the mass embedded in the space filled by points with a density which reaches infinity at the same time .",
    "when considering an object of mass @xmath1 , the initial density field is smoothed on a scale @xmath2 with @xmath3 . to give a concrete expression for this idea one needs a dynamical prescription that allows to follow the evolution of each point of the initial density field and to know its statistical properties .    throughout this paper",
    "we work in a friedman - robertson - walker universe with a critical density parameter , @xmath4 , and initial gaussian random fluctuations . at some early epoch , corresponding to an expansion factor @xmath5 and a redshift @xmath6 , the density fluctuations are entirely described by their power spectrum .",
    "we first multiply this spectrum with a low - pass filter of characteristic scale @xmath2 that cuts the power above a frequency @xmath7 .",
    "the choice of filter is , a priori , arbitrary  ( @xcite ) . we restrict ourselves to the top ",
    "hat window function in real space , because its application has an intuitive physical interpretation .",
    "it allows to consider homogeneous and spherical regions of space .",
    "we then assume that the resulting density field is correctly described by independent fluid elements .",
    "each fluid element is now initially described by some dynamical parameters , which are obtained by smoothing the corresponding fields to the scale @xmath2 . given these initial conditions , we evolve each fluid element separately until it collapses ( i.e. until the density of the fluid element becomes infinite ) .",
    "the evolution has to be followed in a lagrangian way in order to relate the * collapse epoch * of the fluid element to its initial conditions . in the standard ps approach ,",
    "these fluid elements evolve according to the homogeneous spherical model . in this case , the collapse epoch is entirely determined by the initial density contrast of the fluid element .",
    "however , it has been shown by several authors ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) that , during the gravitational collapse , the shear and the tidal forces are very important . consequently",
    ", more complex , non - spherical , gravitational dynamics have to be considered in order to take into consideration these physical effects which are totally discarded in the spherical model .",
    "for lagrangian non - spherical dynamics , the collapse time @xmath8 of a fluid element can depend on several initial smoothed parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the fraction of mass embedded at present ( @xmath11 ) in collapsed structures with a mass greater or equal to @xmath1 is then given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "the selection function @xmath16 makes a direct link between the lagrangian dynamics of the fluid elements and the mass function .",
    "the integral of @xmath16 , with respect to all @xmath17 parameters except the initial density contrast , can be interpreted as a statistical quantity .",
    "this quantity gives the probability that a given region of space becomes part of a bound structure according to its initial density contrast ( @xcite ) .",
    "the right - hand side of equation ( [ fraction ] ) depends on @xmath1 through the smoothing scale @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath18 is the probability density function of the initial smoothed parameters , it represents the fraction of volume filled by the regions of space having initial parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "in general , the above definition runs into the so called `` renormalization problem '' , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "this problem can be alleviated if one carefully considers the fate of regions which have not been selected on a scale @xmath2 , but can be selected with a non  zero probability on another scale @xmath22 , and therefore belong to objects with a mass greater than @xmath1 .",
    "excursion set theory ( @xcite , @xcite , 1991b ) solves this renormalization problem for the particular case of the sharp - k filter , but the physical interpretation of this filter remains unclear . in this work",
    "we do not investigate this renormalization problem .",
    "we always assume that this renormalization is justified in any case .",
    "we therefore divide the mass fraction obtained in equation ( [ fraction ] ) by the constant @xmath23 . the mass function of collapsed objects , which gives the number density of object with mass @xmath1 ,",
    "is then defined as    @xmath24    in order to determine the mass function we therefore have to evaluate the statistical properties of the initial parameters and the collapse epoch associated with these parameters .",
    "in particular , we evaluate the collapse epoch using three different lagrangian dynamics : the spherical model ; the zeldovich approximation and a more realistic local lagrangian model that we introduced in a former paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "these three dynamical models state that the fluid element belongs to a collapsed object when its density becomes infinite .",
    "for the two latter cases , this first singularity corresponds to the collapse of the fluid element along its first principal axis and then favors the formation of sheet  like objects .",
    "one can then ask whether such objects agree with the idea of having a dense , virialized `` blob '' in the density field . unfortunately , lagrangian theory is unable to bypass this first singularity .",
    "we therefore investigate two other models in section 3 which roughly describe the collapse of the fluid element along its second and third axis .",
    "this comparative analysis of the different mass functions we obtain for each case allows one to study the effect of the dynamics , and in particular , the influence of the shear and the tide on the formation of structures in a ps formalism .      in the simplest cases ,",
    "only one initial parameter is needed to determine the collapse epoch of a fluid element .",
    "this is the case for the spherical model , where the initial density contrast entirely determines the evolution of a fluid element , and for the zeldovich approximation where the smallest eigenvalue of the deformation tensor gives the collapse epoch .",
    "however , these dynamics are rather simple .",
    "it does not seem very realistic to account for the variety of physical processes occurring during the collapse with a single initial parameter .",
    "therefore , we also use a local lagrangian dynamic which takes into account , to some extend , the effect of the shear and the tide ( @xcite ) , and then determines the collapse epoch in terms of the three eigenvalues of the deformation tensor .",
    "the collapse epoch ( written here as the collapse redshift @xmath25 ) of a fluid element evolving according to the spherical model is given by the simple formula    @xmath26    where @xmath27 .",
    "we use for all fields its initial value linearly extrapolated to @xmath28 ( for example : @xmath29 ) . within the spherical model ,",
    "the collapse epoch depends only on the initial density contrast and only fluid elements which are initially over - dense , collapse .    in the framework of the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite ) the density contrast of a fluid element evolves according to    @xmath30    where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the three initial eigenvalues of the deformation tensor arranged in decreasing order .",
    "the collapse epoch of the first principal axis is reached when the denominator in equation ( [ zeldel ] ) vanishes    @xmath34    once again @xmath35 is the initial density contrast of the fluid element and @xmath36 are its initial shear eigenvalues . in the case of zero shear , the collapse epoch is given by : @xmath37 .",
    "this means that the exact solution of the spherical case is not recovered , as can be expected for this first order dynamical prescription . for a fixed density contrast ,",
    "the shear accelerates the collapse ( @xmath38 ) and equation ( [ zelac ] ) can be considered as a first simple approximation for non - spherical dynamics .",
    "the zeldovich approximation illustrates in a simple way that the collapse epoch can not be considered as a function of the density contrast alone .",
    "however , computing the collapse epoch in terms of @xmath33 alone is not satisfactory either .",
    "therefore , we present in this paragraph a derivation of the collapse time which uses a lagrangian dynamic based on the deformation tensor .",
    "audit & alimi ( 1996 ) , hereafter aa , have proposed a local lagrangian dynamic to determine the evolution of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor . knowing these eigenvalues and their time derivatives is enough to compute all the other dynamical quantities .",
    "the dynamical prescription of aa is well suited to the computation of the collapse epoch .",
    "it accounts well for the effect of the shear on the collapsing fluid element .",
    "it is exact for spherical , cylindrical and planar geometry and very accurate over a wide range of initial conditions .",
    "similar to the zeldovich approximation , it predicts that under - dense regions can collapse due to the effect of the shear .    in terms of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor",
    ", the density contrast is defined as    @xmath39    the evolution equation for each of the @xmath40 is given in the framework of the aa approximation by    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the conformal time defined by : @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a circular permutation of @xmath45 .",
    "these three equations are highly non linear and have been integrated numerically .",
    "the initial eigenvalues of the shear and deformation tensors are related by : @xmath46 .",
    "the two triplets @xmath47 and @xmath48 are therefore totally equivalent ( @xmath49 is obtained using the relation : @xmath50 ) . in the following ,",
    "we prefer to use the triplet @xmath51 , which allows an immediate physical interpretation .",
    "the eigenvalues of the shear and deformation tensor are always arranged in decreasing order : @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    moreover , in order to integrate equation ( [ aadyn ] ) we only keep the linear growing mode in the initial conditions .",
    "this restriction and the invariance of equation ( [ aadyn ] ) under the transformation : @xmath54 ensures the following scaling law for the collapse epoch    @xmath55    such a property of the collapse time is also present for the spherical model and the zeldovich approximation .",
    "it allows to reduce by one dimension the parameter space that we have to explore to determine the collapse epoch for any initial condition .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to know the function @xmath56 ( resp .",
    "@xmath57 ) representing the inverse of the collapse epoch ( @xmath58 ) in the @xmath59 plane for @xmath60 ( resp .",
    "@xmath61 ) .",
    "then , we can deduce the collapse epoch for any set of initial conditions using the scaling law of equation ( [ scalinglaw ] ) . in figure ( [ invtc ] )",

    "this explains why only a portion of the @xmath65 plane is covered . for each of these plots ,",
    "a thousand points were computed by numerically solving equation ( [ aadyn ] ) .",
    "we present an analytical fit ( accurate to within @xmath66 ) of these two surfaces in appendix  a. for @xmath67 , the fluid element always collapses in a finite time . for @xmath68 ,",
    "a finite area of shear values is singular ( i.e. the collapse time is infinite ) .",
    "this area corresponds to a fluid element whose initial deformation tensor has three positive eigenvalues ( all fluid elements with at least one negative eigenvalue collapse ) .",
    "the two lower panels of figure [ [ invtc ] ] show the inverse of the collapse time as a function of @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the long  dashed line corresponds to the spherical model for which the collapse time is independent of @xmath69 .",
    "the small  dashed line corresponds to the zeldovich approximation .",
    "the full lines represent the inverse collapse time of the aa dynamics .",
    "the upper line corresponds to the case where @xmath72 ( the fastest collapse at given @xmath69 and @xmath35 ) and the lower line to @xmath73 ( the slowest collapse at given @xmath69 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "for @xmath68 the collapse time becomes infinite as @xmath69 reaches @xmath74 .",
    "the spread between the two full lines gives an idea of the influence of @xmath75 on the dynamics and of the importance of the coupling between the different directions of collapse of the fluid element .",
    "note however that the error one could make by neglecting the influence of @xmath75 to compute the collapse epoch of the first principal axis is of the order of 20% .",

    "( 9,9 ) ( 0,0 )    moreover , we see that the standard ( @xmath122 ) ps mass function ( dotted line ) and our mass function have roughly the same slope for small mass objects , although we predict more high mass objects than the standard ps . for example , if the power spectrum is normalised with the condition @xmath123 and assuming assume a critical univers with @xmath124 , we find that our mass function contains @xmath125 more structures of mass @xmath126 , which is the typical mass of galaxy clusters .",
    "in the previous section we have computed the mass function in the framework of the ps formalism using different lagrangian dynamical models to determine the collapse epoch of a fluid element . in all cases ,",
    "the collapse was defined as the epoch when the density contrast becomes infinite .",
    "it is then impossible to follow , with lagrangian dynamics , the evolution of a fluid element beyond this first singularity .",
    "moreover , if one considers that the fluid elements describe extended regions of space , this first singularity corresponds to a stage where the region has totally collapsed along a single direction and reached a sheet  like geometry .",

    ", we have seen that the dispersion of the collapse epoch of the first axis , in the aa approximation , due to the shear on the second axis was of the order of 20% .",
    "this weak dependence suggests that , as in the zeldovich approximation , the different directions of the fluid element can be considered as collapsing independently .",
    "this approximation allows to artificially go beyond the first singularity and to propose an ansatz for the collapse epoch of the second and third axis in order .",
    "we require that the collapse epoch of a fluid element along any of its principal axis satisfies the following properties :    * the collapse epoch along a given axis is a function of the corresponding initial shear eigenvalue and of the initial density contrast . * the scaling properties ( eq .

    "a similar calculation can be carried out for all axes .",
    "the above formula is a general relation between the mass function and the collapse time defined by the underlying dynamical model .    for the third axis , we assume that the collapse epoch is now given by equation ( [ tc3 ] ) and we use the same parameters as for the second axis . the selection function ( fig .",
    "[ [ sel3axis ] ] ) tends to zero as @xmath168 and to unity as @xmath169 .",
    "this reflects the fact that a fraction of the fluid elements with @xmath170 are unable to collapse as the shear inhibits the collapse .",
    "the derivative of the selection function behaves symmetrically about the line @xmath113 compared to the one obtained for the first axis .",
    "its derivative sharpens and peaks at a value which tends towards @xmath115 ( while remaining larger ) as @xmath77 decreases . in the class of models with @xmath171 , it is possible to derive an analytical expression for these qualitative features .",
    "we compute the mean ( which is close to the peak value ) and the variance ( which corresponds to the width ) of the function @xmath172 .",
    "we obtain for the mean    @xmath173    and for the variance    @xmath174    in these last two equations the width and the peak position are linear functions of @xmath77 .",
    "note also that as @xmath175 , we get @xmath176 and @xmath177 , as in the spherical model .",
    "the mass function can also be derived analytically . using formula ( [ fm3axis ] )",
    ", we obtain    @xmath178    the mass function now has two `` dynamical parameters '' , namely @xmath115 and @xmath142 .",
    "the first one describes the influence of the initial density contrast on the collapse epoch and the second one gives the degree of inhibition of the collapse by the shear and the tidal field .",
    "the spherical mass function is recovered in the limits @xmath179 and for small values of @xmath142 most of the fluid elements are unable to collapse because of shear effects . this mass function for @xmath180 and @xmath181 is plotted in figure ( [ fmuni3axis ] ) as a long  dashed line .",
    "the number of objects with @xmath156 has again greatly decreased compared to the second axis collapse . as could be expected , since now the shear always slows down the collapse , the mass function is now much below the standard ps prediction .    in the next section",
    "we investigate the generic behavior of the mass function obtained in this section ( eq . [ [ fm3axis ] ] ) in the low  mass regime .      in the previous section , we postulated a specific form for the collapse epoch of a given fluid element , as a function of @xmath35 and the shear along the third axis . in this section",
    ", we study in a more general way the influence of the shear on the formation of low mass objects .",
    "we consider that the function @xmath128 has the following asymptotic behavior when @xmath182    @xmath183    where @xmath184 .",
    "this parameterization is very general , and makes no assumptions on the general shape of the function @xmath128 .",
    "we calculate analytically the low  mass ( high@xmath77 ) behavior of the mass function as a function of @xmath143 . after some algebra ( cf .",
    "appendix b ) , we obtain two characteristic regimes , valid in the limit @xmath185    @xmath186    note that for the case @xmath149 , the low  mass behavior is the same as for the standard press & schechter mass function .",
    "the domain @xmath187 corresponds to shallower slopes than the standard ps mass function .",
    "however , the zeldovich approximation corresponds to @xmath149 .",
    "therefore , if one considers that this first order approximation overestimates the collapse time , this imposes that    @xmath188    we plot in figure ( [ lowmass ] ) the mass functions we obtained using the collapse epoch from formula ( [ tc3 ] ) for different values of @xmath189 .",
    "we set the parameter @xmath190 for each curve in figure ( [ lowmass ] ) .",
    "this parameter determines the point where the change of slope occurs in the mass function ( in our case , this corresponds to @xmath191 ) .",
    "this result is extremely important as it shows that shear effects can easily modify the low  mass behavior of the mass function .",
    "the regime @xmath192 is of primary importance , because it is independent of the specific form of the function @xmath128 , which is unfortunately an unknown quantity . in this case , for a power law power spectrum , one obtains in the low  mass end of the mass function @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the index of the power spectrum . assuming a constant mass  to  light ratio , this leads to a faint  end slope of the luminosity function @xmath195 .",
    "note that the corresponding power law for the standard ps mass function would have been @xmath196 .",
    "the observed luminosity function of field galaxies exhibits this power law behavior at low ",
    "luminosity with @xmath197 ( loveday et al .",
    "1994 ; efstathiou , ellis & peterson 1988 ) .",
    "it has been previously argued ( blanchard et al .",
    "1992 ) that for a cdm power spectrum with @xmath198 at these scales , it is impossible to reconcile the ps formalism ( @xmath199 ) with the observed luminosity function without imposing some ad  hoc procedures , such as a variable mass  to  light ratio , or some other biasing mechanism due to the dissipative physics of the baryonic gas . here",
    ", we recover @xmath197 with a power spectrum @xmath200 , using only gravitational processes , and more precisely by considering the effect of the shear .",
    "we claim here that the a cdm  like power spectrum is able to reproduce the low  mass end of the luminosity function , when the shear and tidal effects are correctly taken into account .",
    "note that the ps formalism is better suited for field galaxies than for galaxies in clusters where tidal effects are much stronger . with this formalism",
    ", the clusters are considered as single objects whose internal structure can not be described .",
    "in this paper , we extend the ps formalism to more complex , and perhaps more realistic dynamical models than the standard spherical model .",
    "we study the influence of the shear and tidal effects on the mass function of cosmic structures .",
    "the lagrangian evolution of a given halo from the initial volume up to the final dense and virialized object , can be divided into three stages : the collapse of the first , second and third axes .",
    "each stage corresponds to a certain geometry of the halo formed ( sheet  like , filamentary and quasi ",
    "spherical ) and also to a certain collapse epoch . in the lagrangian formalism",
    ", this collapse epoch depends purely on the initial shear and density contrast .",
    "the mass function of these halos is then obtained from the collapse epoch and from the statistics of the initial parameters .",
    "we investigate in this paper the influence of the initial shear on the dynamics of the forming halos . in the case of sheet  like objects , the lagrangian theory of gravitational dynamics allows us to compute the collapse epoch of the first principal axis as a function of @xmath35 and @xmath69 and @xmath75 , the initial density contrast and two eigenvalues of the initial shear tensor .",
    "we use for that purpose a new approximation presented by audit & alimi ( 1996 ) . in this case",
    "we obtain a mass function which is well fitted by a ps mass function , with @xmath121 .",
    "this result is explained by the fact that shear and tidal effects always accelerate the collapse of a fluid element along its first principal axes .",
    "we therefore obtain more high  mass objects than the standard ps mass function ( see also monaco 1995 ) .",
    "we then investigate the mass function of objects that collapse along their second and third principal axis .",
    "we considere simple and general models since lagrangian theory is unable to describe the evolution of a fluid element beyond the collapse of the first axis .",
    "we find that the resulting mass function in the case of the second axis collapse is very similar to the standard ps mass function ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "finally , we derive analytically a new formula for the mass function of objects resulting from the collapse of their third axis .",
    "this depends on two parameters , namely a density threshold @xmath115 and a shear threshold @xmath142 .",
    "we recover the standard ps formula in the case @xmath179 . for values of @xmath142 comparable to unity ,",
    "the peak of the multiplicity function is lower than the peak obtained by the standard ps approach .",
    "this could explain why such an effect has been detected in numerical simulations ( efstathiou et al .",
    "we also derive analytically the low  mass regime of the mass function computed in a wide class of models .",
    "we show that it is possible to obtain a low  mass slope very close to the faint ",
    "end slope of the luminosity function of field galaxies .",
    "in all the dynamical models we use , the resulting mass functions show common features such as a high  mass exponential cut  off and a low  mass power law .",
    "the exact shape of the multiplicity function around the peak is , however , directly related to the underlying dynamical model .",
    "this has to be tested in numerical simulations , where the mass function should correspond to a dynamical model that drives the collapse of every halo ( at least in a statistical sense ) .",
    "we postpone this numerical work to a companion paper .",
