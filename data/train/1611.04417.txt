    "the last 40 years , the problem of transmitting digital information via lattice constellations has been extensively studied , mainly for the interest that lattices arise when dealing with continuous channels ; interest that is not fading with time , since , for instance , in the near future lattice codes will play an important role in physical - layer network coding for 5 g networks .",
    "maybe with a slightly rough generalization , we can divide the results in the literature into two main opposite domains : the ( information-)theoretical ones , aimed to analytically prove the capacity - achieving properties of lattice codes @xcite ; and the practical ones , in which authors design lattice families particularly adapted to fast and efficient decoding with satisfactory performance @xcite . at the price of some technical challenges - whose solution is not always straightforward - this second group of results focuses on translating to the euclidean space the techiques used for designing effective iteratively decodable error - correcting codes over finite fields , like turbo codes , ldpc codes , and polar codes . for some of these families are also available information - theoretical results , the first step towards a unified theory that surpasses the previous dichotomy @xcite .",
    "most of the available practical results treat the properties of lattices as infinite constellations , comparing performance with the theoretical limits established in @xcite .",
    "when we move our attention to finite constellations , the theory tells that a winning strategy to achieve capacity is to carve voronoi constellations out of poltyrev - capacity - achieving infinite constellations , using shaping lattices that are good for quantization @xcite .",
    "however , in practice this approach is hard to realize , mainly due to the complexity of quantization algorithms for general lattices .",
    "nevertheless , some implementable shaping schemes have been proposed @xcite , mainly for ldlc lattices @xcite , and very recently the problem of encoding constellations of nested lattices with an application - oriented approach was treated by kurkoski @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on voronoi constellations for the awgn channel where the fine lattices are non - binary construction - a lattices .",
    "we have chosen construction a because it constitutes a powerful tool for the construction of both poltyrev - capacity - achieving lattices and optimal or near - optimal shaping regions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it yields integer lattices , whose encoding and decoding algorithms are more easily implemented with respect to non - integer lattice constellations ( like for instance ldlc ) .",
    "our main result consists in the theoretical description and the numerical performance analysis of what we call leech constellations of construction - a lattices .",
    "in particular , our idea is to use a direct sum of leech lattices as shaping lattice for voronoi constellations .",
    "the shaping gain of the leech lattice is only around @xmath1 db away from the optimal shaping gain of a spherical infinite - dimensional shaping region . even though this is not enough to formally achieve capacity over the awgn channel , using the leech lattice for shaping decreases the encoding complexity with respect to more general shaping - lattice constructions ; it also allows to obtain very appreciable decoding performance .",
    "experimentally , we reach outstanding error probabilities at a distance of only @xmath0 db from shannon capacity ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : leech_constellation ] ) .",
    "although shaping with direct sums of low - dimensional lattices has recently been proposed by other authors @xcite , no explicit results using the leech lattice were shown before .",
    "another novelty of our work is that we cut out our finite constellations from dual - diagonal low - density construction - a ( lda ) lattices . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this specific construction was never employed in the non - binary case and as base element for construction a. we have chosen lda lattices as candidates for our leech shaping because of the very satisfying decoding peformance that they have shown in our previous work , from both the theoretical and practical point of view @xcite .",
    "this performance is confirmed by the infinite - constellation simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infinite_dd_lda ] for the unconstrained awgn channel .",
    "moreover and very importantly , the family of dual - diagonal lda lattices is designed on purpose to allow fast encoding in spite of the leech shaping . in particular , the encoding of the non - binary ldpc code underlying the lda construction can be done via its parity - check matrix , with complexity linear in the blocklength .",
    "the encoding and demapping algorithms are described in detail in section [ sec : encoding_demapping ] ; they are based on lemma [ lem : classes ] , which is the theoretical novelty on which this work is based .",
    "section [ sec : lattices_awgn ] is dedicated to recall some knowledge about lattices and lattice codes for the awgn channel . in section [ sec : leech_constellations ] we give the definition of leech constellations and in section [ sec : encoding_demapping ] we explain how to perform their encoding and demapping .",
    "the latter are based on lemma [ lem : classes ] , which characterizes the quotient group given by the equivalence classes of the fine lattice modulo the shaping lattice . in section [ sec : dual_diag_ldpc ] we introduce non - binary dual - diagonal lda lattices , which are defined by the means of their parity - check matrix .",
    "they are used in section [ sec : simulations ] for numerical simulations , which experimentally show the goodness of leech constellations .",
    "the paper finishes with section [ sec : conclusion ] , which summarizes our achievements and contains some conclusive remarks .      in this paper",

    "this concludes the demapping procedure .",

    "in section [ sec : lattices_awgn ] we mentioned that we need performant ( ideally poltyrev - capacity - achieving ) fine lattices for the construction of strong voronoi constellations ; furthermore , in section [ sec : encoding ] we saw that linear - complexity encoding of leech constellations is possible if the encoding of the underlying @xmath197-ary code @xmath27 is linear in @xmath23 too . in this section",
    ", we propose the algebraic construction of a lattice family which possesses both qualities : excellent performance over the unconstrained awgn channel and fast encoding . as fine lattices ,",
    "we choose a particular family of _ lda lattices _ :    we call _ low - density construction - a ( lda ) _ lattice a lattice built with construction a when the underlying code @xmath27 is a low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) code .",
    "ldpc codes were invented by gallager @xcite , have had a huge success , and do not need further introduction .",
    "lda lattices were proposed by the authors of this work a few years ago @xcite ; they are endowed with an iterative low - complexity decoder which allows fast decoding with very appreciable performance .",
    "well - defined ensembles of lda lattices were proved to be poltyrev - capacity - achieving first @xcite , then also shannon - capacity - achieving @xcite and good for other communication - related problems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we look for lda lattices that can be rapidly encoded .",
    "our solution is to use construction a with ldpc codes whose parity - check matrix @xmath220 has a dual - diagonal submatrix . by extension ,",
    "we call them _ dual - diagonal ldpc codes _ and their associated lda lattices _ dual - diagonal lda lattices_. recall that a parity - check matrix of a code @xmath27 is a matrix @xmath220 such that @xmath221 . for our construction",
    ", we impose that @xmath220 has the following structure : @xmath222 with @xmath223 for every @xmath224 and @xmath225 for every @xmath226 .",
    "the matrix @xmath220 has @xmath227 rows and @xmath23 columns and its right submatrix is square and dual - diagonal .",
    "moreover , to build lda lattices , we need @xmath220 to be sparse , hence its left submatrix @xmath228 ( of size @xmath229 ) has to be sparse too .",
    "in particular , we choose it also to be _ regular _ : it has a fixed constant number of non - zero entries in every column and row .",
    "we call these numbers respectively the _ column degree _ @xmath230 and the _ row degree _ @xmath231 of @xmath228 . by construction , @xmath220 is full - rank , hence the rate of the ldpc code that it identifies is @xmath232 .",
    "furthermore , all the rows of @xmath220 have degree @xmath233 , except for the first row , that has degree @xmath234 .",
    "if we count the number of non - zero entries at first column by column and then row by row , we relate the degrees and the code parameters via the following equality : @xmath235 by simplifying the previous formula , we can easily derive that @xmath236 this kind of dual - diagonal parity - check matrix has been used for several practical applications in the literature of binary lpdc and ira codes @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge it was never applied to non - binary constructions or lattice constructions .",
    "the main advantage of using non - binary ldpc codes is that their design has an additional degree of freedom : when building @xmath220 , once we fix the degrees , the only freedom that we have in the binary case concerns the choice of the positions of the @xmath237 s in @xmath228 ; in the non - binary case , instead , we also have to fix the values of the non - zero entries among @xmath238 .",
    "this choice plays an important role and we will discuss it in the next section .    given the dual - diagonal parity - check matrix @xmath220 as in and an information vector @xmath165 , the codeword @xmath239 associated with @xmath168 is obtained in the following way :    1 .",
    "@xmath240 , for every @xmath241 .",
    "the first parity - check equation of @xmath27 , defined by the first equation of @xmath220 , is : @xmath242 the only unknown is @xmath243 , that can therefore be computed easily .",
    "3 .   for @xmath244 ,",
    "the @xmath111-th parity - check equation is : @xmath245 a priori , the unknowns in the previous congruence are @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "4 .   yet , for @xmath248 , the only unknwon is @xmath249 , because we computed @xmath250 in step 2 ) .",
    "thus @xmath249 can be obtained too . in turn , this means that now we can also compute @xmath251 from the third parity - check equation , and so on so forth , we recursively obtain all the @xmath124 s for @xmath252 .",
    "the key observation here is that , because of the sparsity of @xmath228 , most of the @xmath253 s are equal to @xmath35 for @xmath224 and @xmath254 .",
    "more precisely , exactly @xmath231 of them are non - zero for every fixed @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the number of operations required to compute @xmath247 in steps 2)-4 ) is constant in @xmath23 for every fixed @xmath111 .",
    "hence , the whole encoding procedure of the ldpc code has complexity @xmath255 . as a consequence of the comments done at the end of section [ sec : encoding ] , this also implies that the whole encoding algorithm of a leech constellation with underlying dual - diagonal ldpc code has complexity linear in @xmath23 .",
    "finally , notice that when we apply the steps 1)-4 ) above , the codeword @xmath167 is built systematically , in the sense that the information vector @xmath168 coincides with the first @xmath26 coordinates of @xmath167 .",
    "this guarantees that we can perform step 2 ) of section [ sec : demapping ] for demapping .",
