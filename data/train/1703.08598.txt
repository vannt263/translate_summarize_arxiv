    "molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) gas and its mass distribution in galaxies is of fundamental importance in determining their structural and dynamical characteristics , as well as the process of star formation in them .",
    "it does not have a permanent dipole moment , and at its lowest energy level ( @xmath13 ) , the s(2 - 0 ) quadrupole transition in the far - ir wavelength can not trace the bulk of the h@xmath2 molecules which predominantly lie in the cold ( @xmath14 ) phase . the astronomical community has therefore implemented other lines to infer this mass indirectly typically using co , the next most abundant molecule after h@xmath2 itself with its bright rotational transitions in the millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelength regime ( [ co]/[h@xmath2]@xmath15 in milky way , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* where [ ] denotes the abundance compared to h - nuclei number density ) .",
    "unlike h@xmath2 , co has a permanent dipole moment and rotational transitions with @xmath16 are allowed , e.g. co @xmath17 at @xmath18 is the most commonly used as an h@xmath2 gas tracer , with higher-@xmath19 transitions becoming accessible at high redshifts in the age of atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) at the high altitude of llano de chajnantor plateau in chile .",
    "the goal of this work is to explore to what extent co remains a good tracer of the molecular gas mass and dynamics in regions with elevated crs , such as expected in actively star - forming galaxies typical for the early universe .",
    "once the co ( @xmath17 ) line emission is detected , a scaling factor is used to convert its velocity - integrated brightness temperature ( or the line luminosity ) to h@xmath2 column density on scales of molecular clouds or larger .",
    "this method is statistically robust for m(h@xmath2)@xmath2010@xmath21 ( for an investigation on the physical condition dependencies and the underlying physics of the co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factor , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this co - to - h@xmath2 method , calibrated in galactic conditions @xcite , is widely used in extragalactic observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if multi-@xmath19 co ( or other molecules like hcn ) line observations reveal average gas densities , temperatures and/or dynamic states of molecular clouds that differ from those in the milky way there exists a theoretical framework to use appropriately modified co - to - h@xmath2 conversion factors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these techniques work as long as co and other molecules used to study its average conditions ( e.g. hcn ) remain sufficiently abundant in gmcs , typically not much less abundant as in the galactic gmcs where these techniques have been calibrated .",
    "low - metallicity ( z ) molecular gas , especially when irradiated by strong fuv radiation , was the first h@xmath2 gas phase for which early studies showed that the standard techniques actually fail @xcite .",
    "this means that low - z gas in the outer parts of even ordinary spiral galaxies , like the milky way , may then be in a very co - poor phase and thus impossible to trace using co lines @xcite .",
    "atomic carbon ( c ) line emission is another alternative for deducing the molecular gas distribution in galaxies and one that can be as reliable as low-@xmath19 co lines .",
    "this is because of its widespread emission in h@xmath2 clouds despite of what is expected from the classical theory of photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) @xcite .",
    "there are a number of reasons contributing towards c line emission being fully associated with co line emission and having larger emergent flux densities per h@xmath2 column density than those of the low - co rotational lines used as global h@xmath2 gas tracers .",
    "this led to an early proposal for using the two c lines , @xmath22p@xmath23-@xmath22p@xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) at 492  ghz and @xmath22p@xmath2-@xmath22p@xmath23 ( @xmath26 ) at 809  ghz , and especially the lower frequency line , as routine h@xmath2 gas tracers in galaxies for @xmath27 when the lines shift into the millimeter band @xcite .",
    "such a method can now be extended in the local universe as imaging at high frequencies can be performed by alma @xcite . in our galaxy ,",
    "the vela molecular ridge cloud c shows that atomic carbon can trace accurately the h@xmath2 gas mass @xcite . for extragalactic studies , @xcite",
    "find that in the centre of the seyfert galaxy circinus , the c - traced h@xmath2 mass is consistent with that derived from sub - millimeter dust continuum and multiple-@xmath19 co excitation analysis , while c observations have recently been used to trace the h@xmath2 gas mass in distant starbursts at z@xmath284 @xcite .",
    "the ongoing discussion regarding the widespread c line emission in molecular clouds , and thus their ability to trace h@xmath2 independently of @xmath29co and @xmath30co lines , took another turn after the recent discovery that cosmic rays ( crs ) can very effectively destroy co throughout h@xmath2 clouds , leaving c ( but not much c@xmath1 ) in their wake ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter  b15  , see also @xcite ) .",
    "unlike fuv photons that only do so at the surface of h@xmath2 clouds and produce c@xmath1 rather than c , crs destroy co volumetrically and can render h@xmath2 clouds partly or wholly co - invisible even in ism environments with modestly boosted cr ionization rates of @xmath31galactic , where @xmath0 is the cosmic - ray ionization rate ( @xmath32 ) @xcite .",
    "the latter values are expected in typical star - forming ( sf ) galaxies in the universe @xcite , currently studied only using co ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite inferred a cosmic - ray ionization rate of @xmath33 in their analysis of co / c@xmath1 emissions in the high redshift hdf 850.1 .",
    "b15 found that besides the ability of c lines in tracing the co - rich parts of an h@xmath2 cloud , they also probe the co - poor regions .",
    "this is of particular interest especially if its lines are to be a viable h@xmath2-tracing alternative to co lines . in the current work we re - examine",
    "these cr - induced effects discussed by b15 in the much more realistic setting of inhomogeneous h@xmath2 clouds , that could affect their ` visibility ' in co , c , and c@xmath1 line emission .",
    "furthermore , we discuss in more detail the chemistry behind the cr - control of the [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratio and its dependence on the gas temperature which itself is affected by cosmic rays .",
    "the latter proves to be a very important factor that should be taken into account in turbulent - dynamic cloud simulations that explore similar issues .",
    "models of co - destruction in cosmic - ray dominated regions ( crdrs ) , predict that low-@xmath19 co / c line flux ratios are general low , @xmath34 .",
    "recent alma observations of the spiderweb galaxy by @xcite find that @xmath35/@xmath36 which can be potentially explained from the presence of high cr energy densities .",
    "another interesting recent example is the observation of the @xmath37/@xmath38 ratio in the starburst galaxy ngc253 @xcite which , in association with early @xmath35 observations indicating warm h@xmath2 gas @xcite , could be due to high @xmath0 values .",
    "high cr energy densities are expected to maintain higher gas temperatures even in far - uv - shielded environments .",
    "b15 estimate a gas temperature of @xmath39 when the cr ionization rate , @xmath40 , is boosted up to @xmath41 times the mean galactic value .    in this paper",
    "we perform astrochemical simulations of the effects of larger than galactic cr energy densities on inhomogeneous molecular clouds , using the 3d - pdr code @xcite to infer the distributions of the co , c , c@xmath42 abundances and of the gas temperature .",
    "this is a continuation of the b15 work using much more realistic molecular cloud structures rather than those of uniform - density or radially varying densities explored previously .",
    "moreover , we now also analyze the chemistry involved in the cr - induced destruction of co , and its conversion to c , in greater detail . in all of our simulations",
    "we assume that the bulk of the h@xmath2 gas interacts with crs throughout the cloud volume ( i.e. the h@xmath2 gas ` sees ' crs , with the same spectrum , throughout the volume of the cloud ) . while this is not true for some regions deep inside clouds @xcite , and",
    "can depend on the specifics of magnetic fields @xcite , it remains a very good approximation for the _ bulk _ of h@xmath2 clouds in sf - galaxies @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : simulations ] we present the setup of our simulations . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of our calculations and in particular how the probability density functions and the abundance distribution of the above key species , as well as the corresponding heating and cooling functions vary under the different conditions explored . in section  [ sec : oh ]",
    "we discuss how oh enhances the [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratio at higher temperatures when @xmath40 increases and in section  [ sec : discussion ] we refer to the impact of our findings in observations .",

    "should a co - invisible h@xmath2 gas mass lie ` on - top ' of co - rich ( and thus observable ) cloud regions in the mid - plane of a sf disk , it would exert an ` overpressure ' on the co - rich ones .",
    "this would appear as a deviation from a galactic line - width size relation and co clouds that would seem to be out of virial equillibrium , lowering their corresponding @xmath205 factor @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the very weak dependance of the line - width size relation on @xmath215 allows large amounts of co - invisible gas to exist without easily discernible observational effects . for a purely h@xmath2 gas disk ( @xmath216 ) ( assumed here for simplicity )",
    ", a @xmath217 larger h@xmath2 gas surface density would raise @xmath215 by a factor of 25 , but the corresponding @xmath218 of co - rich clouds embedded inside such overlying columns of co - invisible gas only by a factor of @xmath219 .",
    "the latter is within the observational uncertainty of the @xmath220 relation in the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and thus any @xmath205 calibration of such overpressured co - rich clouds would still give a value consistent with a galactic one within the uncertainties .      the physics and chemistry of the cr - induced destruction of co",
    "can now be readily used in galaxy - sized / cosmological evolution models .",
    "doing so will : a ) shed light on what happens in the context of galaxy evolution models as the @xmath221/cr ` boundary ' conditions of molecular clouds evolve , and b ) help the interface of such models with actual observables ( e.g. low-@xmath19 co and c images of galaxies with alma / jvla ) .",
    "past work has already incorporated , in a sub - grid fashion , the effects of fuv destruction of co in h@xmath2 clouds inside galaxies @xcite .",
    "cr - driven effects will be even easier to implement in such models insofar as full transparency of h@xmath2 clouds to crs and @xmath222 are assumed .",
    "moreover , c lines as h@xmath2 gas mass tracers in galaxies at high redshifts have already been discussed in a cosmological context @xcite . once cr effects are taken into account in galaxy - scale models , one can then : a ) evaluate the best method(s ) in obtaining the h@xmath2 mass distributions and velocity fields in sf galaxies evolving across cosmic epoch , and b ) ascertain whether current theoretical views about the role of unstable giant h@xmath2 clumps in driving the sf of gas - rich early galaxies @xcite still hold ( e.g. a c - imaged @xmath210 distribution may be a smoother one than a co - imaged one in a cr - irradiated gaseous disk , impacting also the deduced gas velocity fields from these lines ) .",
    "such models can also shed light on another very important caveat discussed by b15 , namely the role of turbulence .",
    "observations of the so called ( u)lirgs , extreme merger / starburst systems , indicate that regions with high sfr density ( and thus @xmath0 ) are also regions of strong turbulence of h@xmath2 clouds , and thus of high @xmath223 mass fractions per gmc . with co remaining abundant in high - density gas ( @xmath133 ) , even when average @xmath0 are high , this can diminish and even counteract the effects of cr - induced co destruction in such environments as now most of the h@xmath2 gas no longer resides in the low - density regime ( @xmath224 ) as in the mw ( densities where",
    "co would be cr - destroyed very effectively ) but at high densities . in this regard ,",
    "the [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratio obtained from our simulations is of particular interest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : coh2 ] we plot this ratio versus the total h - nucleus number density for all four different @xmath68 examined . for @xmath70",
    "most of the molecular cloud gas has [ co]/[h@xmath2]@xmath197 , making it very co - poor . for higher densities and according to b15",
    ", this ratio would exceed @xmath225 at @xmath73 only for @xmath133 assuming no significant freeze - out .",
    "numerical simulations of individual turbulent h@xmath2 clouds study the effects of constant , pre - set fuv radiation fields and cr energy densities on the co and c distributions and the corresponding line emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* as well as the present work ) .",
    "such models , while useful in finding trends of co and c line emission as h@xmath2 gas mass tracers in gmcs , _ they can not address the issue of what happens when such clouds are immersed in actual galaxies , _ where the fuv and cr energy densities around these clouds vary strongly on timescales equal or shorter than internal cloud chemical and dynamical timescales @xcite .",
    "this is because in individual cloud simulations the ` boundary ' conditions of fuv radiation , @xmath0 , and turbulent energy injection are not tracked .",
    "galaxy - sized models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that include h@xmath2 clouds , along with the appropriate physics and chemistry behind the fuv / cr ` drivers ' , modelled _ in tandem _ with the evolving conditions of a sf galaxy are thus invaluable in examining whether in high sfr - density environments , h@xmath2 gas remains mostly co - rich or not ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an early such treatment where co and h@xmath2 are treated separately and fuv radiation onto clouds within galaxies is tracked ) .",
    "regardless of any future theoretical ` verdict ' on whether co - invisible molecular gas can exist in large quantities in sf galaxies in the early universe during periods of high sfr densities , observations of low-@xmath19 co _ and _ c lines in such systems are indispensable .",
    "here we re - iterate that the c column density retains its robustness in tracing h@xmath2 column near - proportionally for @xmath226 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cd ] ) .",
    "in particular we find that for such cr - ionization rates , @xmath227i@xmath228 ( for our adopted carbon elemental abundance ) .",
    "this relation depends weakly on @xmath0 provided that @xmath229 , contrary to the corresponding one for co. moreover , even for mw - level of @xmath0 values , the @xmath25 per beam will remain larger than that of co @xmath17 or @xmath230 ( the two co transitions used to trace the bulk of h@xmath2 mass in galaxies ) as long as the same beam is used to image the h@xmath2 gas in all lines/@xmath37 in milky way is @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "if we were to observe @xmath25 and @xmath37 at the same resolution , then in the rayleigh - jeans regime the flux per beam boost would be @xmath231 .",
    "this can lead to signal - to - noise advantages for the c line obsrevations depending on the redshift of the object ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath68 is increased , c lines are becoming brighter still , increasing this kind of advantage . ] .",
    "this , along with the possibility that c line imaging of sf disks at high-@xmath232 finds a different ( smoother and/or possibly more extended ) h@xmath2 gas distribution , because of large quantities of co - poor h@xmath2 , argues strongly for sensitive c line imaging of gas - rich sf galaxies ( bisbas et al . _ in preparation)_.    in this work we also identified the exact chemistry behind the large gas temperature sensitivity on the co formation in h@xmath2 clouds ( see  [ sec : oh ] ) , an issue initially discussed by b15 .",
    "the gas temperature sensitivity of our results elevates the importance of reliable computation of the average thermal state of h@xmath2 gas in fuv / cr - intensive environments found within sf galaxies . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] , crs can provide an important heating source throughout the gmc and particularly in regions with @xmath233 .",
    "this in turn can increase the gas temperature deep in the cloud ( where the fuv has been severely attenuated ) to values of the order of @xmath234 @xcite .",
    "such gas temperatures are still low for the co formation to occur via the o+h@xmath1 charge transfer . in low metallicity galaxies",
    ", a higher gas temperature may be expected as cooling efficiency and shielding is less than in solar metallicity ones , perhaps moderating the cr - induced destruction of co in high @xmath68 environments , as discussed in  [ sec : oh ] .",
    "it is thus necessary that the cr effects are studied together with those driven by lower metallicities in order to discern their combined impact on the average [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance in metal - poor star forming galaxies .",
    "even though we used standard cooling / heating mechanisms of pdr / crdr physics ( see  [ ssec : heatcool ] ) , turbulence will also heat the molecular gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and do so in a volumetric manner just like the crs .",
    "turbulent heating has even been argued as a dominant heating mechanism of galaxy - sized h@xmath2 gas reservoirs in some extreme sf galaxies @xcite , even as numerical simulations of individual molecular clouds show that turbulent heating typically affects only @xmath192 of their mass @xcite .",
    "the so - called ` brick ' cloud is a well studied object close to the galactic centre .",
    "simulations performed by @xcite have reproduced its observed gas and dust temperatures when their modeled cloud interacts with a fuv of strength @xmath235 and a @xmath236 .",
    "early suggestions by @xcite proposed that the gas heating of the central molecular zone ( cmz ) at the galactic centre is primarily dominated by cosmic - rays and/or turbulence .",
    "recent observations by @xcite , however , show that the dominant heating mechanism of the particular ` brick ' cloud is turbulence which , in association with an lvg analysis , give an upper limit of @xmath237",
    ". however , in places of the cmz cosmic - rays may still be a very important heating source particular in less turbulent sub - regions @xcite .",
    "our simple treatment of turbulent heating @xcite leaves unaswered the question of how much it can influence the average thermal states of the typically very turbulent h@xmath2 gas in extreme starbursts with high sfr densities .",
    "numerical simulations of individual h@xmath2 gas clouds , at mach numbers appropriate for the ism of galaxies with very high sfr densities ( @xmath238 times that of ordinary spirals ) , that include turbulent heating along with the chemistry and physics of cr - induced co destruction are necessary for answering this question . if strong turbulence can elevate the _",
    "h@xmath2 gas temperatures and densities of galaxies with high sfr densities ( typically merger / starbursts ) , it may still keep the [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratio high and the h@xmath2 gas traceable via the traditional methods based on co ( see b15 for the relevant discussion ) .",
    "in this paper , continuing the study of @xcite , we present results from a suite of three - dimensional astrochemical simulations of inhomogeneous molecular clouds , rendered as a fractal , and embedded in different cosmic - ray ionization rates spanning three orders of magnitude ( @xmath239 ) along with a constant isotropic fuv radiation field ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "our study therefore focuses only on the effect of high cosmic - ray ionization rates expected in sf galaxies in the universe , and how it affects the abundances of co , c , c@xmath1 , hi and h@xmath2 .",
    "we used the 3d - pdr @xcite code to perform full thermal balance and chemistry calculations .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the column density and total h@xmath2 mass of a typical inhomogeneous gmc remains nearly constant for increasing @xmath68 , with the total mass of h@xmath2 decreasing by @xmath240 for @xmath236 ( @xmath241 ) . on the other hand a significant reduction of the [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratio sets in throughout the cloud ,",
    "even when @xmath242 ( @xmath243 ) , a value expected for the ism of many star - forming galaxies in the universe .",
    "2 .   when the average @xmath0 increases further , up to @xmath244 the co molecule is destroyed so thoroughly that only the densest regions of the gmc remain co - rich .",
    "the abundances of c and c@xmath1 on the other hand increase , with the latter becoming particularly abundant for @xmath245 .",
    "atomic carbon is the species that proves to be the most abundant , ` marking ' most of the h@xmath2 mass of the cloud over a wide range of @xmath0 values .",
    "using only co rotational transitions to discern the average state and mass of such cr - irradiated gmcs will only recover their highest density peaks ( @xmath151 ) , make the clouds appear clumpier than they truly are , and convey biased information on the molecular gas velocity fields .",
    "we expect significant effects of cr - induced destruction of co to occur in the so - called main sequence galaxies , the systems where most of the cosmic history of star formation unfolds .",
    "this is a result of their high sf rates ( implying high cr rates ) and seemingly galactic - type molecular clouds .",
    "the widespread cr destruction of co expected in such systems will make the calibration of their @xmath205 factor challenging , even for their co - bright gas .",
    "4 .   our computations recover gas temperatures of @xmath91 for the cr - irradiated and fuv - shielded dense regions inside those gmcs .",
    "this is indeed typical for such regions in the galaxy and it remains robust over @xmath246 .",
    "this is of particular importance if the initial conditions of sf , and the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) mass scale ( i.e. the imf ` knee ' ) are indeed set within such regions .",
    "nevertheless , once @xmath247 , the temperature of such regions rises up to @xmath248 , and the initial conditions of star formation in such galaxies are bound to change .",
    "the main heating mechanisms in cosmic - ray dominated regions apart from crs , are the chemical mechanism ( due to the large amounts of ions expected in crdrs ) and the h@xmath2 formation mechanism . cooling on the other hand ,",
    "is mainly due to c@xmath1 and o with the contribution of co cooling nearly negligible , as its abundance is at least two orders of magnitude lower than in normal galactic conditions .",
    "we find the cr - regulated [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratio to be sensitive to the temperature of the gas once @xmath249 .",
    "a significant production of the oh molecule , acting as an intermediary , is the @xmath82-sensitive part of the chemical network that determines the [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] ratio . for warm gas at @xmath169 abundant",
    "oh can keep the molecular gas co - rich ( i.e. [ co]/[h@xmath2]@xmath15 ) , even in high cr energy environments . the severe cr - induced destruction of co sets in for @xmath250 , which our thermochemical calculations indicate as containing the bulk of h@xmath2 mass in our inhomogeneous cloud models , and indeed the bulk of molecular gas in sf galaxies , except perhaps in the most extreme merger / starbursts . 7 .   our simple treatment of turbulent heating , and the fact that gmcs in the very high sfr density environments of merger / starburst galaxies are much more turbulent and thus denser , necessitate careful considerations of turbulent heating and a dynamic rendering of density inhomogeneities in order to explore our findings in a fully realistic setting . 8 .",
    "finally , the chemistry and thermal - balance calculations behind the cr - controlled [ co]/[h@xmath2 ] , [ c]/[h@xmath2 ] , and [ c@xmath1]/[h@xmath2 ] abundance ratios inside inhomogeneous h@xmath2 clouds can be used in a sub - grid fashion as elements of galaxy - sized numerical simulations of evolving galaxies .",
    "this is perhaps a vital ingredient of any realistic galaxy evolution model across cosmic epoch , given the elevated sfr densities and thus cr energy densities typically observed in galaxies in the distant universe .    as a final conclusion",
    "we mention that because of the strong effects of crs on the co abundance combined with the effects of high fuv and/or low metallicity environments in further reducing its abundance , and the impracticallity of c@xmath42 imaging in sf galaxies except for the highest redshift objects ( @xmath251 ) , a concerted effort must be mounted by the extragalactic community towards c line imaging of h@xmath2 gas in the universe as a viable alternative .",
