    "in numerical simulations of the late inspiral and merger of binary neutron - star systems , one commonly specifies an equation of state for the matter , perform a numerical simulation and extract the gravitational waveforms produced in the inspiral .",
    "the scope of this talk is to report work on the inverse problem : if gravitational radiation from an inspiraling binary system is detected , can one use it to infer the bulk properties of neutron star matter and , if so , with what accuracy ? to answer this question , a number of simulations with systematic variation of the equation of state ( eos ) is performed .",
    "the simulations use the evolution and initial - data codes of shibata and ury to compute the last several orbits and the merger of neutron stars , with matter described by a parameterized equation of state , previously obtained in @xcite .",
    "our analysis uses waveforms from these simulations to examine the accuracy with which detectors with the sensitivity of advanced ligo can extract from inspiral waveforms an eos parameter associated with the stiffness of the neutron star eos above nuclear density .",
    "one might expect that gravitational wave observations can potentially measure properties of neutron star eos by measuring departures from the point - particle limit of the gravitational waveform produced during the late inspiral of a binary system .",
    "a way to quantify this departure is to make use of the fact that the gravitational wave phase near the end of inspiral accumulates more rapidly for smaller values of the neutron star compactness ( the ratio of the mass of a neutron star to its radius ) . in this way ,",
    "greater accuracy may be obtained compared to previous work that suggested the use of an effective cutoff frequency to place constraints on the equation of state .",
    "our results based on this approach suggest that realistic equations of state will lead to gravitational waveforms that are distinguishable from point particle inspirals at a distance @xmath0 for an optimally oriented system , using advanced ligo in a broadband or narrowband configuration .",
    "waveform analysis , that uses the sensitivity curves of commissioned and proposed gravitational wave detectors , allows us to also estimate the accuracy with which neutron star radii , closely linked to the eos parameter varied , can be extracted .",
    "the choice of eos parameter varied in this work is motivated by the fact that , as lattimer and prakash observed @xcite , neutron - star radius is closely tied to the pressure at density not far above nuclear .",
    "analysis of the numerical waveforms also indicates that optimizing the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors to frequencies above 700 hz can lead to improved constraints on the radius and eos   of neutron stars .",
    "difficulties inherent in astrophysically constraining the eos of neutron star matter are the wide range of different microphysical models , implying the lack of a model - independent set of fundamental observables , and the fact that models often have more free parameters than the number of astrophysical observables . therefore , an effort to systematize such constraints necessitates a form of eos ( i ) parameterized in a model independent way , with a number of eos parameters ( ii ) large enough to accurately model the universe of candidate eos , but ( iii ) smaller than the number of neutron star observables that have been measured or will have been measured in the next several years .    in the past , for different purposes , mller and eriguchi @xcite have used non - relativistic piecewise polytropes , with a large number ( 20 - 100 ) of segments , to accurately approximate realistic eos , in order to construct newtonian models of differentially rotating stars . more recently , with conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and",
    "especially ( iii ) in mind , read et al @xcite have developed a relativistic piecewise polytropic approximation , which reproduces the features of most realistic neutron star eos with rms error @xmath1 , using only 3 - 4 segments ( or 3 - 4 free parameters ) , as described below .",
    "the eos pressure @xmath2 is specified as a function of rest mass density @xmath3 ( rest mass density @xmath4 is proportional to number density @xmath5 , where @xmath6 g is the mean baryon rest mass ) .",
    "the relativistic piecewise polytropic eos proposed in @xcite has the form @xmath7 in a set of intervals @xmath8 in rest mass density , with the constants @xmath9 determined by requiring continuity on each dividing density @xmath10 : @xmath11 the energy density @xmath12 as a function of @xmath3 is then determined by the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath13 which is integrated , to give @xmath14 ( for @xmath15 ) , where we used the condition @xmath16 as @xmath17 .",
    "this condition implies @xmath18 and the other constants @xmath19 are fixed by continuity of @xmath20 at each @xmath10 . in the above equations ,",
    "@xmath3 is measured in g@xmath21 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 have units of erg@xmath21@xmath22dyn@xmath23 and @xmath24 is the speed of light .",
    "the specific enthalpy , @xmath25 , is dimensionless and is given by @xmath26 the crust eos is considered to be known and , for the purposes of this work , can be modelled with a single polytropic region , fitted to a tabulated crust eos for the region above neutron drip ( @xmath27-@xmath28g@xmath21 ) ; the numerical simulations considered do not resolve densities below this .",
    "this polytrope has @xmath29 , with @xmath30 chosen so that @xmath31dyn@xmath23 when @xmath32g@xmath21 .",
    "the core eos is constructed independently of crust behavior . in @xcite",
    "it was found that three zones within the core , with adiabatic exponents @xmath33 as parameters , are needed to model the full range of proposed eos models with sufficient accuracy .",
    "a fourth parameter , @xmath34 , is needed to fix an overall pressure shift , specified at the fiducial density @xmath35 .",
    "the dividing densities @xmath36 are _ not _ considered new parameters .",
    "instead , they are fixed by minimizing the error in fitting a large set of candidate eos , leading @xcite to the preferred values @xmath37g@xmath21 and @xmath38g@xmath21 .",
    "the first dividing density @xmath39 between the crust and core varies by eos , but is also not a new parameter .",
    "it is defined as the density for which the @xmath40 vs. @xmath41 curves of the crust and core eos intersect . fixing the crust eos and determining the three dividing densities in this way , allows one to model a large set of candidate eos with only four parameters @xmath42 .    using this parameterized eos",
    ", one can construct relativistic models of neutron stars and compute astrophysical observables , such as maximum mass , radius , moment of inertia etc .",
    "doing so , while systematically varying the eos parameters @xmath42 , read et al @xcite have obtained constraints on the allowed parameter space set by causality [ fig .  1 ] and by present and near - future astronomical observation .",
    "they find that two measured properties of a single star can potentially place stringent constraints on the eos parameter space and that a potential measurement of the moment of inertia of a pulsar can strongly constrain the maximum neutron - star mass [ figs .",
    "1 ,  2 ] . a detailed study of these constraints may be found in @xcite .",
    "the potential combination of such astrophysical constraints with gravitational wave observation can restrict the allowed eos parameter space region to a surface ( thickened by the error bars of the observations ) or even a line .",
    "the rest of this talk focuses on constraints placed on neutron star eos by potential detection of binary inspiral waveforms .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]      many higher order but likely relevant effects have been neglected in this preliminary analysis .",
    "tidal effects may measurably influence the orbital evolution before the start of the numerical simulations , as estimated in @xcite , slowly enough not to be seen over the few cycles of the waveform matched to pp in this analysis . in one sense",
    "this analysis is a worst - case scenario , as it assumes exact pp behavior before the numerical match .",
    "earlier drift away from point particle dynamics would give larger differences between waveforms , and more sensitive radius measurement , but poses a challenge by requiring accurate numerical simulation over many cycles to verify eos effects . combining numerical estimation with pn analyses like those of @xcite , and/or quasiequilibrium sequence information [ fig .",
    "5 ] may clarify the transition between effectively pp and tidally influenced regimes .",
    "some residual eccentricity from initial data and finite numerical resolution is present in the waveforms themselves .",
    "the eccentricity error may be estimated by comparing the plus polarization to the cross polarization shifted by @xmath43 from the same numerical waveform .",
    "this results in @xmath44 of @xmath45 for hb and 2h , rather than the expected quadrupole polarization cross - correlation of zero .",
    "the 2b waveform produces @xmath46 between polarizations .",
    "we have only a coarsely sampled family of waveforms ; estimates of @xmath47 are limited by this .",
    "further , the length of the inspirals ( see discussion on pn matching in @xcite ) limits precision in choosing the best match time .",
    "we can estimate these effects on current results by varying the match region considered ; this changes @xmath44 by up to @xmath48 at 100mpc in the broadband detector .",
    "the resolution from existing numerical simulations is comparable to the difference between parameters of some of the models . the estimated uncertainty in each @xmath44 is smaller than ( but comparable to ) the @xmath44 between candidates 2h , hb , 2b and pp .",
    "finally , we note that use of a fisher matrix estimate of parameter measurement accuracy is fully valid only in high snr limit of @xmath49 @xcite , i.e. , for distances @xmath50mpc in the broadband detector .",
    "the results do not take into account multiple detectors , nor multiple observations , nor parameter correlations .",
    "we conclude that , although these are of course first estimates , they should be better than order - of - magnitude",
    ". a full estimation of eos parameter measurability will require more detailed analysis , with a larger set of inspiral simulations sampling a broader region of eos parameter space , with mass ratios departing from unity , and with more orbits simulated before merger .",
    "this is a first quantitative estimate of the measurability of the eos of cold matter above nuclear density with gravitational wave detectors .",
    "neutron stars of the same mass but different eos and thus different radii will emit different gravitational waveforms during a late stage of binary inspiral .",
    "we calculated the signal strength of this difference in waveform using the sensitivity curves of commissioned and proposed gravitational wave detectors , and find that there is a measurably different signal from the inspirals of binary neutron stars with different eos .",
    "although the standard noise configuration of advanced ligo is not sensitive to differences in the waveform from finite size effects , a broadband ( burst - optimized ) configuration or a narrowband detector configuration of advanced ligo can distinguish neutron star eos from each other and from point particle inspiral , at an effective distance @xmath51 100mpc .",
    "in addition , the provisional standard noise curve of the einstein telescope indicates the ability to resolve different eos at roughly double that distance .    with broadband advanced ligo at frequencies between 500 and 1000hz ,",
    "our first estimates show that the radius can be determined to an accuracy of @xmath52 .",
    "related first estimates show that such observations can constrain an eos parameter parameter @xmath53 , the pressure at a rest mass density @xmath54g@xmath21 , with an accuracy of @xmath55 .",
    "these estimates neglect correlations between the parameters and other details of internal structure , which are expected to give relatively small tidal effect corrections .",
    "although these results are preliminary , they strongly motivate further work on gravitational wave constraints from binary neutron star inspirals .",
    "the accuracy of the estimates will be improved with numerical simulation of more orbits in the late inspiral and a wider exploration of the eos  parameter space .",
