    "carrier sense multiple - access ( csma ) type protocols form a popular class of medium access protocols for wireless networks .",
    "the first csma protocol was introduced by kleinrock and tobagi  @xcite in 1975 , and has seen many incarnations since , including the widely used 802.11 standard . in this paper",
    "we provide an asymptotic analysis of large wireless networks operating under csma , in the presence of collisions .",
    "csma is a randomized protocol that allows nodes to access the medium in a distributed manner .",
    "the absence of a centralized scheduler creates more flexibility and allows for the deployment of larger networks .",
    "an early example of such a randomized procedure is the aloha protocol @xcite , which forces nodes to wait for some random backoff period before starting a transmission , in order to reduce the likelihood of nearby nodes transmitting simultaneously .",
    "the latter event would cause the signals to interfere with each other , and may result in a collision that renders the transmissions useless .",
    "csma improves upon aloha by letting nodes _ sense _ their surroundings to detect the presence of other transmitting nodes .",
    "if a node detects at least one active ( i.e.  transmitting ) node within its sensing range , its backoff timer is frozen , deferring the countdown until the channel is sensed clear . using this mechanism ,",
    "collisions can be further reduced .",
    "a key performance measure in wireless networks is throughput , which we define as the average number of successful transmissions per unit of time .",
    "we investigate the relation between the sensing range and the throughput .",
    "the effect of the sensing range can be understood as follows .",
    "a small sensing range allows for more simultaneous transmissions , but is less effective in reducing collisions . on the other hand , a large sensing range admits fewer transmissions , but also mitigates interference .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is the examination of this tradeoff in relation to its effect on the throughput .",
    "the network is characterized by the sensing range and the interference range .",
    "a node can only initiate a new transmission when all nodes within its sensing range are inactive .",
    "this transmission is successful when all nodes within the interference range of the destination node are inactive , and fails otherwise .",
    "the network performance suffers from two complementary issues : hidden nodes and exposed nodes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hidden nodes are nodes located outside the sensing range of the transmitter and are therefore not detected by the carrier - sensing mechanism . hidden nodes cause collisions as they are within the receiver s interference range .",
    "exposed nodes are nodes located outside the receiver s interference range but inside the sender s sensing range .",
    "so despite being harmless to the transmission , exposed nodes are nevertheless blocked . as the sensing range grows , the number of hidden nodes decreases , and the number of exposed nodes increases .",
    "in recent years the carrier - sensing tradeoff between hidden and exposed nodes has received much attention @xcite .",
    "most of these analytic studies make the assumption that the activity of nodes and their backoff processes are independent , which greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "the interaction between nodes , however , should be taken into account , as it is typical for the distributed control and has a large impact on the performance of the network .",
    "we do take into account this interaction , by keeping track of the activity of nodes over time . the classical model for such interaction in wireless networks",
    "is developed in boorstyn and kershenbaum  @xcite .",
    "this model has been used in recent years to study throughput - optimality  @xcite and fairness  @xcite in a setting without collisions .",
    "the stability region for large wireless networks with collisions was investigated in @xcite .    in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", we model the network as a continuous - time markov process with interaction between the nodes , so that nodes within a certain distance of an active node are silenced , just as in csma . such interaction is referred to in statistical physics as _ hard - core _ interaction .",
    "this paper is part of a larger program to study wireless networks via hard - core models from statistical physics .",
    "typical for such models is the existence of a gibbs measure that describes the stationary distribution .",
    "this gibbs measure is normalized by the partition function , which involves a computationally cumbersome summation over all possible configurations .",
    "a substantial ingredient of this paper is to characterize and approximate the partition function .",
    "we shall consider the network , and thus the partition function , in the asymptotic regime where the number of nodes in the network tends to infinity .",
    "for such infinite line networks we are able to obtain structural results on the joint effect of hidden nodes and exposed nodes.we determine analytically the throughput - optimal sensing range that achieves the best tradeoff between reducing hidden nodes and preventing exposed nodes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : model_auxiliary ] we introduce the model , and derive some auxiliary results .",
    "section  [ sec : main_results ] discusses the main results on the carrier - sensing tradeoff . in section  [ sec : detailed_study ] we perform a detailed study of the partition function . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we validate the analytical results for the line network by simulation , and we investigate networks with more general topologies .",
    "in section  [ sec : proofs ] we present the proofs of those results that are not already proved in earlier sections .",
    "we consider a linear array of @xmath0 nodes , and we denote the set of all nodes by @xmath1 .",
    "whenever a node activates , it transmits a single packet to a neighboring node . with probability @xmath2",
    ", the packet is intended for its right neighbor , and with probability @xmath3 for its left neighbor . to accommodate this , we introduce ( pure destination ) nodes  @xmath4 and  @xmath5 , which receive packets , but do not transmit packets themselves . as will be shown in proposition",
    "[ pro : throughput ] , the throughput is insensitive to the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that all nodes are saturated , meaning that they have an infinite supply of packets available .",
    "after each transmission nodes enter a backoff period , meaning that they will remain inactive for some time .",
    "the length of the backoff period is assumed to be exponentially distributed with mean  @xmath6 .",
    "we assume all nodes to have the same sensing range  @xmath7 , so that node  @xmath8 is prohibited from transmitting whenever at least one node @xmath9 for which @xmath10 is active ( i.e.  transmitting ) , in which case we say that node @xmath8 is _ blocked _ by node @xmath9 .",
    "so when a node finishes its backoff period and it finds at least one node within distance @xmath7 active , it enters a new backoff period .",
    "when a node finds all nodes within distance  @xmath7 inactive upon finishing backoff , it starts a transmission .",
    "transmissions last for an exponentially distributed duration with unit mean . under these assumptions , the @xmath11-dimensional process that describes the activity of nodes is a continuous - time markov process .",
    "each state of the markov process is described by @xmath12 where @xmath13 when node  @xmath8 is active , and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "let @xmath15 be the set of all _ feasible _ states .",
    "here we call @xmath16 feasible if no two @xmath17 s in @xmath16 are @xmath7 positions or less apart , i.e. ,  @xmath18 if @xmath19 . let @xmath20 denote the vector with all zeros , except for a 1 at position @xmath8 .",
    "the markov process that describes the activity of nodes is then fully specified by the state space @xmath21 and the transition rates @xmath22 it is well known that this is a reversible markov process ( see @xcite ) with limiting distribution @xmath23 with @xmath24 the partition function or normalization constant of the probability distribution @xmath25 .",
    "the partition function can be defined recursively as ( see @xcite ) @xmath26 the sequence @xmath27 is well studied .",
    "in fact , for a network with @xmath28 nodes , @xmath29 represents the partition function , defined as the summation of probability over all possible states .",

    ", we introduce an interference range  @xmath40 .",
    "a transmission succeeds if and only if at the start of this transmission no nodes within distance @xmath40 of the receiving node are already active .",
    "this type of interference is referred to in the literature as the _ perfect capture _ collision model @xcite .",
    "note that neither   nor   depends on @xmath40 , as collisions have no impact on the dynamics of the system . using the sensing range @xmath7 and interference range @xmath40 we can define formally hidden nodes and exposed nodes .",
    "consider a transmission from node  @xmath8 to node  @xmath9 .",
    "hidden nodes are then defined as nodes that are outside the sensing range of  @xmath8 , but within the interference range of  @xmath9 .",
    "such nodes are not blocked by the activity of node  @xmath8 , but their proximity to node  @xmath9 makes the hidden nodes harmful to the transmission from  @xmath8 to  @xmath9 .",
    "conversely , exposed nodes are those nodes that are within the sensing range of @xmath8 , but outside the interference range of @xmath9 .",
    "such nodes are blocked by an ongoing transmission from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , despite the fact that they will not cause this transmission to fail .",
    "denote by @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) the set of hidden nodes of transmissions from node  0 to node  1 ( node  -1 ) : all nodes outside the sensing range of 0 , but within the interference range of the receiving node  1 ( node  -1 ) .",
    "by @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) we denote the set of nodes to which this transmission is exposed , so all nodes within the sensing range of  0 , but outside the interference range of the receiving node . for completeness",
    "we let @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) denote the set of all remaining nodes that block transmissions from node  @xmath47 to node  @xmath17 ( node  -1 ) .",
    "this yields : @xmath48 so @xmath49 .",
    "an example is given in figure  [ fig : hidden ] .",
    "node 3 is a hidden node , as it interferes with the transmission from node @xmath47 to node @xmath17 ( @xmath50 ) despite the carrier - sensing mechanism ( @xmath51 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : exposed ] node 0 is an exposed node to the transmission from node  2 to node  3 because it would not interfere ( @xmath50 ) with this transmission but is nevertheless silenced by the activity of node  2 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "we focus on node  0 ( the node in the middle of the network ) and in particular its throughput @xmath53 defined as the average number of successful transmissions per unit of time .",
    "[ pro : throughput ] the throughput of node  0 is given by @xmath54    denote by @xmath55 @xmath56 the rate of successful transmission of node  0 to node  1 ( node  -1 ) , so @xmath57 .",
    "the activation attempts to node 1 ( node -1 ) occur according to a poisson process with rate @xmath58 ( rate @xmath59 ) .",
    "we first consider activation attempts to node 1 . whether an activation attempt is successful depends on the state of the system when this attempt occurs .",
    "define @xmath60 when the system is in state @xmath61 , the attempt is blocked and node  0 remains in its current state .",
    "when the system is in a state @xmath62 , node  0 is not blocked so it activates .",
    "however , at least one hidden node is active so the transmission fails and does not contribute to the throughput .",
    "when the system is in state @xmath63 , the perfect capture assumption guarantees a successful transmission .",
    "it follows from the pasta property ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the probability of an arbitrary activation attempt resulting in a successful transmission is equal to the limiting probability of the system being in a state @xmath63 .",
    "so the rate of successful transmissions initialized ( and thus the throughput ) is given by @xmath64 from the definitions of @xmath45 , @xmath43 and @xmath41 we see that @xmath65 where @xmath66    let @xmath67 denote the partition function for a subset of nodes @xmath68 defined as @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath70 the model on the line has the property that by conditioning on the activity of one of the nodes , its state space can be decomposed , leading to two smaller instances of the same model on the line .",

    "we conclude that @xmath197 provides a good approximation for the behavior of finite - sized networks , already for small and moderate values of @xmath90 .",
    "to investigate more general topologies , we first need a more elaborate description of the model .",

    "first we consider @xmath199 nodes placed on a @xmath200 grid at unit distance from each other .",
    "the grid is wrapped around ( top and bottom nodes on any vertical line and left and right nodes on any horizontal line are connected ) so that the network is fully symmetric and all nodes have the same environment ( and the same throughput ) , eliminating boundary effects .",

    "wireless networks equipped with csma on complex topologies form highly relevant objects for further study .",
