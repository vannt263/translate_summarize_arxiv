    "visual observers reported detection of zonal bands and occasional spots on uranus as early as 1870 @xcite , but a reliable measure of atmospheric motions on uranus had to wait until 1986 , when close - up voyager-2 images revealed eight discrete cloud features between planetocentric latitudes of 35s and 70s @xcite .",
    "tracking these features , combined with one radio occultation wind measurement at 5s , yielded a crude zonal wind profile @xcite , the main feature of which appeared to be a high - speed ( @xmath1250 m / s ) prograde jet near 60s and a weaker broad retrograde equatorial jet .",
    "voyager did not provide wind information in the northern hemisphere , which was near its winter solstice and dark at the time of the encounter .",
    "eleven years later , hubble space telescope ( hst ) near - ir images of uranus revealed many more discrete cloud features , enabling the extension of wind measurements into the northern hemisphere @xcite , confirming an approximate n - s symmetry in the wind profile .",
    "groundbased observations from the keck ii telescope , which combined a large aperture , near - ir wavelengths , and adaptive optics , produced a bounty of cloud features far beyond the hubble results @xcite .",
    "the wind profile of uranus was last updated by @xcite , combining wind observations from the above references with new measurements in 2009 - 2011 from gemini , keck , and hst observatories .",
    "here we use as a reference their 13-term asymmetric legendre fit given in their table 6 and plotted in their fig . 11 .",
    "this will be hereafter referred to as model * s13a*. the main results enabled by their new measurements were : ( 1 ) clear definition of the magnitude and latitude of the northern jet peak ; ( 2 ) discovery that motions north of the peak were consistent with solid body rotation ; ( 3 ) discovery of a new class of cloud features in the polar regions that resemble cumulus cloud fields and bear similarities to the cloud structure in the polar regions of saturn ; and ( 4 ) characterization of the large morphological asymmetry between southern summer polar latitudes and northern spring polar latitudes .",
    "the updated profile still suffered from a lack of targets in low latitudes ( 20s - 20n ) and in the south polar region , where , save for one uv feature identified by voyager , no discrete clouds had ever been seen .",
    "the @xcite work was advanced by the use of high s / n techniques to improve detectability and facilitate tracking of low contrast cloud features .",
    "the basic idea was to use long exposures to grow the signal linearly in exposure time while random noise grew as the square root , thus increasing s / n as the square root of the exposure time . to avoid the smearing of long exposures by planetary rotation",
    ", we took multiple short exposures , rotated the planet images to the same central meridian longitude , then averaged the de - rotated images .",
    "@xcite verified this process using keck imagery and applied it to specially designed hst imaging to provide new wind measurements .",
    "@xcite applied it to gemini imaging in 2011 , and to a limited degree to keck imaging in 2011 , though highly variable seeing limited the benefits that were possible .",
    "much improved results were obtained from subsequent observations with better seeing that resulted in better ao performance .",
    "the 2012 results shown in fig .  [ fig : bestim ] , first presented by @xcite and @xcite , were the most detailed images of uranus ever obtained up to that time .",
    "features revealed by those images are discussed in section  [ sec : patterns ] .",

    "note the narrow bright latitude bands spaced about 2.5apart in the 48 - 53range , and the numerous small bright spots north of 55n .",
    "the bright narrow feature in the southern hemisphere is the epsilon ring of uranus.,width=316 ]    since 2007 , our view of the north polar region of uranus improved significantly : at opposition , the the sub - solar latitude reached 19.5n in 2012 , 23.5n in 2013 , and 27.6n in 2014 .",
    "this resulted in observations well suited to further refinement of the zonal wind profile in the northern hemisphere and better characterization of its polar cloud features .",
    "it also helped to fill in poorly sampled regions , mainly at low latitudes .",
    "fortunate periods of high quality seeing also allowed us to apply high s / n techniques more extensively and thereby detect and track more subtle features . in the following",
    "we describe the new observations , the measurement results from each data set , new views of the north polar region of uranus and the different styles of discrete cloud features located there , new features discovered at low latitudes , and finally , approximate altitude constraints on the cloud features .",
    "table  [ tbl : obslist ] summarizes keck and gemini imaging observations of uranus acquired from 2012 through 2014 .",
    "the camera characteristics for each groundbased observing configuration are given in table [ tbl : cameras ] , in which the pixel scale of 0.02138@xmath20.0005 arcsec / pixel listed for the gemini niri camera was derived from measurements of uranus and its satellites in comparison with horizons ephemeris positions , as described by @xcite .",
    "we used the keck ii / nirc2 pixel scale provided by the keck observatory web site , which we found to be consistent with measurements of the uranian ring system .",
    "for gemini ao operation , we used a bright uranian satellite ( usually ariel ) as the wavefront reference , while for keck ii ao operation we were able to use uranus itself , providing a substantial gain in reference object brightness ( vmag=5.6 vs. vmag@xmath414 ) and thus in image quality for similar seeing conditions .",
    "except for the image s / n enhancement , described in more detail by @xcite , image processing and navigation followed the same procedures described by @xcite . to aid in long - term tracking of a long lived feature that was first observed in august 2014 ( identified as f in a later section )",

    "the wave is also evident in several other images , including the gemini image from 4 october 2012 .",
    "when first observed in 2012 , it was suggested that this might be an unstable feature because of morphological similarities to unstable waves in high - shear regions .",
    "the persistence of the waveform , and the lack of evidence for high ( or any ) zonal wind shear in the region of the wave , suggests that other explanations might be needed .",
    "these images also show a persistence of small cloud features at high northern latitudes , although the contrast of these features in the 2014 images seems to be reduced , perhaps by a developing haze in the north polar region @xcite ( note the brighter near - pole region in 2014 relative to that in 2012 ) .",
    "there is a general lack of discrete cloud features south of 30n , with the striking exception of 2014 images ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imsamples]q - t ) , which not only display numerous cloud features in this region , but also several unusually bright ones , including the brightest ever seen in k@xmath3 images @xcite , and the second brightest ever seen in h - band images . the brightest feature in h - band images",
    "@xcite was seen in 2005 at a planetographic latitude of 31n .",
    "we also acquired hcont images in groups of 12 ( for keck observations ) .",
    "images with the hcont filter ( not shown ) differ from the h - filter images in having relatively brighter mid latitudes , more noise ( due to less throughput in the narrow - band filter ) , generally lower contrast , and fewer visible cloud features .",
    "the average penetration depths of light within these filter bands into a clear uranus atmosphere are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : penprof ] .",
    "the different vertical weighting of hcont images allows the combination of h and hcont images to constrain the vertical location of cloud features .",
    "limited imaging with ch4s and k@xmath3 filters provided additional constraints , which are all discussed in section  [ sec : vertical ] .",
    "we used maximum correlation tracking , as described by @xcite , to maximize the number of cloud targets that could be usefully tracked and to reduce errors in position measurements .",
    "we displayed an image sequence as a stacked series of narrow horizontal strips , each containing a rectangular projection covering a specified range of longitudes and a narrow range of latitudes , using 0.2@xmath60.2image pixels , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scrnshot1 ] . for each cloud target visible in the selected latitude range ,",
    "a reference image is selected and a target box is adjusted in size and position in the reference image so that the box contains the cloud feature and a small region outside of it .",
    "target boxes in other images are initially positioned using _ a prior _ wind profile ; then the guess is manually adjusted as needed to insure that all target boxes contain the target feature .",
    "the positions of the target boxes in all but the reference images are then automatically precision - adjusted to maximize the cross correlation between the reference target box signal variations and those contained in each of the other boxes .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath7 was computed using @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are brightness values at the @xmath11th pixel location in images @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 their average values , and the summation is over all corresponding pixels in the target boxes .         to reduce the impact of large - scale variations such as produced by latitude bands , we use high - pass filters to display local contrast and remove large - scale image slopes before correlation .",
    "measurements of longitude and latitude vs. time were fit to straight lines using both unweighted and weighted fits , and assigned errors that were the larger of the two estimates obtained from linear regression .",
    "the results are produced in real time as each target is tracked and displayed as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scrnshot1 ] . errors in latitude and longitude are estimated in two ways .",
    "the first is an a priori computation of the scaled root sum of squared errors produced by displacements of one image pixel in both dimensions .",
    "these errors , which provide the basis for the weighted fits , vary appropriately with view angle and position on the disk and are important when the number of samples is small .",
    "but , when the number of samples is large , the second and more accurate error estimate is computed from the rms deviation of the measurements from a straight line fit , as it includes both navigation errors as well as target identification and tracking errors .",
    "this second estimate provides the basis for the unweighted fits .",
    "we made over 850 measurements of cloud feature drift rates in the 2012 - 2014 images , mostly tracking small discrete cloud features , with each drift rate based on from 3 to 11 individual position measurements .",
    "for comparison , the voyager mission returned only 8 wind measurements @xcite and the recent extensive reanalysis of voyager images by @xcite yielded 27 trackable discrete features .",
    "the keck data from 2014 provided an exceptional number of measurements , which is a result of the increased activity of uranus in 2014 , not due to exceptional image quality .",
    "in fact , image quality during the 5 - 6 august observing run was a little below par for our typical keck ii observations .    the distribution of measurements in longitude and latitude segregated by data set is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] . as can be seen from this figure and the plot of statistical properties in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstats ] , the measurements are heavily weighted to the northern hemisphere , where discrete cloud targets are most numerous .",
    "furthermore , because the sub - earth and sub - solar points are in the northern hemisphere , the cloud features there are visible over a longer time span during a given observing night than is possible at southern latitudes . consequently , even were the distribution of targets uniform , there would still be more measurements and more accurate measurements in the northern hemisphere .",
    "especially numerous were cloud features north of 45n .",
    "not surprisingly , these data sets provided no observations below about 40s .",
    "the distribution of wind measurements over a wide range of longitudes for most data sets achieves a major objective of our high s / n observing program , i.e. to avoid having wind results dominated by a few large features and features in their immediate surroundings , which might be generated by the large feature and travel along with it , even at a different latitude .",
    "[ fig : distribution ] also classifies each drift rate measurement according to median correlation of the set of position measurements used to determine the drift rate .",
    "the darker the plotted point , the higher the median correlation , and the more likely the cloud did not evolve much during the tracked interval , and was elevated above the noise level , improving the accuracy of the position tracking .",
    "most of the measurements obtained median correlation peaks that were between 0.8 and 1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mstats]e ) . near - equatorial features that appear to be associated with waves had some of the lowest median correlation peaks ( 0.4 - 0.6 ) .",
    "discrete cloud features were tracked in sequences of up to eleven images , always in at least three , and most in 5 - 9 image sequences .",
    "the standard deviation of latitude measurements for a given cloud target ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mstats]b ) was usually within one or two map pixels ( 0.2/pixel ) , as were longitude measurements , which were all determined by correlation .",
    "most features were tracked using target boxes between 3and 10 in longitude and 2 - 5 in latitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mstats]e - f ) . for compact features",
    "both latitude and longitude positions of the cloud boxes were determined by correlation , which was done to compensate for small navigation errors between images . but navigation errors are responsible for only part of the dispersion in latitude measurements .",
    "the remainder is due to evolution in cloud target morphology over time , and to some degree it may be due to latitudinal drifts and/or oscillations , though it is only tracking over long time intervals that revealed any statistically significant latitudinal motion .",
    "figure  [ fig : mstats ] also shows that a subset of our measurements used correlation boxes that were wide ( in longitude ) and narrow ( in latitude ) , which were designed to group together a number of nearby features at the same latitude to allow a more precise determination of their group drift rate within a single transit .",
    "these were usually 1.2 in latitude and 50 - 100 in longitude .",
    "for these boxes we did correlation tracking of only the longitudinal displacement to avoid latitude shifts due to the brightest cloud feature included .",
    "a key factor in the resulting accuracy of the wind measurement was the length of time that a target could be tracked ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mstats]h ) .",
    "the shortest time that we considered even marginally useful was one hour .",
    "typically the best we could obtain within a single night of observing was a little over 4 hours .",
    "when a feature could be identified on successive nights , which was possible mostly only for higher - latitude features , wind accuracy improved dramatically . for some targets tracked in gemini data sets we were able to track targets over a span of several hundred hours ( with significant coverage gaps of course ) . even longer tracking times",
    "were achieved for six persistent discrete features identified mainly in keck imagery and discussed in section  [ sec : long ] .",
    "the measurements of the westward drift rate relative to the planet s longitude system are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : driftplot1 ] , where the full data set of 852 measurements is shown in panel a and a subset including only the 163 most accurate measurements in panel b. these two samples are both compared to the model s13a , shown as a solid curve , and its reflection about the equator shown as the dotted curve .",
    "points falling on the solid curve would tend to confirm the asymmetry previously inferred .",
    "points between the solid and dotted curves would be more consistent with hemispheric symmetry .",
    "since many of our points fall between these two curves , they suggest somewhat less asymmetry than the prior fit . a more detailed analysis of asymmetry is discussed in section  [ sec : asymm ] .",
    "the largest discrepancies between our new observations and the prior legendre polynomial fit are near the equator and at high latitudes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : driftplot1 ] ) . in the north polar region , we find a very robust determination of solid body rotation between 62n and 83n , with a westward rotation rate of 4.1/h relative to the planet s interior rotation rate of 360/17.24h ( = 20.88/h ) .",
    "that corresponds to a rotational period of 14.41 hours .",
    "the prior legendre polynomial fit has a relative solid body rotational period of 4.3/h , which is less accurate because of fewer measurements , shorter time tracks , and poorer views of high latitudes .",
    "the second discrepancy with the prior wind profile occurs within 6of the equator .",
    "measurements with the highest accuracy , based on small discrete clouds of high contrast in 2014 images , yield a very small longitudinal drift of 0.1/h eastward between 1n and 5s , while the legendre fit suggests a drift rate of about 0.4/h to the east .",
    "that latter drift rate is more compatible with our lower accuracy measurements in this region , which are based on much more diffuse low - contrast features that have relatively low median correlations , or on wave patterns , such as the nearly sinusoidal dark ribbon visible in several of the images in fig .",
    "[ fig : imsamples ] .",
    "it is clear that the wave features drift eastward at close to four times the rate observed for the small discrete features tracked in 2014 .",
    "drift rates similar to those measured for wave features in our 2012 - 2014 observations were also observed by @xcite , who found , in their 2003 images of uranus , `` fuzzy patches '' within 2of the equator moving with an average eastward velocity of 47 m / s , or 0.38/h eastward .",
    "similar features measured by @xcite 2 - 3north of the equator , were found to move eastward at a rate of 0.51/h .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found the features to have roughly a 40spacing in longitude , while @xcite found a 30spacing , but with gaps .",
    "the features in our 2012 - 2014 observations seem to be near 36 , and not quite twice the period of the ribbon wave .",
    "( this is presented in section  [ sec : waves ] . )",
    "these high s / n images indicate that not all the equatorial features match the average spacing of 36 ; some have considerably different spacings .",
    "there are also gaps and regions where features are spread out and difficult to locate .",
    "it is not clear that the wave producing these features extends entirely around the planet .",
    "the variability of these features may explain the discrepancies between prior measurements of their spacings .",
    "selecting only the high - accuracy observations leaves significant gaps in latitude coverage . to fill in those gaps",
    "we average observations within latitude bins , using the estimated variance of each observation as its weight in computing a weighted average .",
    "the results for 2bins are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bin1 ] and tabulated in tables  [ tbl : northbin ] and [ tbl : southbin ] .",
    "this procedure does indeed fill in many of the missing latitudes in the high - accuracy subset .",
    "the estimated error of the weighted average measurements is so small in most bins that it is within the plotted symbol .",
    "the region of solid body rotation is seen to be very uniform in these binned results .",
    "between 65n and 83n , we obtain an average of the binned measurements of 4.079/h with a standard deviation of 0.015/h , compared to a range of weighted average expected errors of .002 - 0.022/h .    near the equator , binned results display significant scatter .",
    "just north of the equator , the binned results are in rough agreement with the old ( s13a ) wind profile .",
    "but just south of the equator , the high accuracy winds from small high - contrast features has dominated the winds inferred from larger scale low contrast and wave features .",
    "an odd feature of the binned results is that the wind profile in the region from about 18n to 45n seems to have a sequence of stair steps of local solid body rotation extending for a few degrees with sharp , high shear transitions between them .",
    "it could very well be the case that the zonal wind profile of uranus is simply not a very smooth function of latitude .",
    "we also tried binning at 1intervals , and found the same stair - step structure between 10n and 30n , but hints of that structure at other latitudes were no longer evident , perhaps due to increased variability .",
    "the north polar region of solid - body rotation was largely unchanged by reducing the bin size , except for small increases in noise due to reduced numbers of samples per bin .",
    "no fundamentally new structures ( that could be distinguished from noise ) were found in the wind profile by using smaller bin sizes of 1or 0.5 .",

    "most of the zonal drift rates in this region have been estimated by tracking wave features , either the ribbon wave that can be seen near 5s in the most of the high s /",
    "n images , or diffuse bright features that also seem to be associated with waves . an unusual appearance of compact discrete cloud features in the 2014 images in the 0 - 5s region provided a distinctly different drift rate estimate that is close to zero . which of these is the best estimate of the atmospheric mass flow is not certain , although waves are often seen traveling relative to the mass flow .",
    "thus we tend to favor the small discrete clouds as more representative of the mass flow . on the other hand , the only independent measure of the mass flow , inferred from radio occultation measurements @xcite suggests that the mass flow is more eastward than either the wave or discrete feature results , although the measurement has such a large error bar that it does not provide a very firm constraint .",
    "our aim in carrying out polynomial fits to the wind observations was to provide a smooth profile for atmospheric modelers and other researchers .",
    "we modeled longitudinal drift rates and wind speeds using the following legendre expansion and conversion equations:@xmath16 where @xmath17 are the coefficients given in table  [ tbl : legfits ] , @xmath18 is the @xmath11th legendre polynomial evaluated at the sine of planetographic latitude @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the longitudinal drift rate in /h ( using planetographic longitude , which is east longitude for a retrograde rotator like uranus ) , @xmath21 is the westward wind speed in m / s , @xmath22 is the radius of rotation in km at latitude @xmath19 , which is the distance from a point on the 1-bar surface to the planet s rotational axis , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the equatorial and polar radii of uranus , for which we use 25559 km and 24973 km @xcite .",
    "we fit the longitudinal drift rates rather than wind speeds , because the former do not change as dramatically at high latitudes as the latter , and thus are much easier to fit without generating large deviations in data - sparse latitude regions .",
    "to limit such large deviations , we also need to limit the order of the polynomials . for the symmetric fits ,",
    "the summation over @xmath11 is only over the even polynomials .",
    "the model coefficients are found by minimizing @xmath25 , but with error estimates for the observations modified as described by @xcite and paraphrased in the following paragraph .",
    "note that while we tabulate drift rates in east longitude , the plots show westward drift rates to be consistent with the prior practice of making prograde ( in this case westward ) winds positive @xcite .",
    "because very accurate measurements of drift rates at nearly the same latitude often differ by many times the value expected from those uncertainties , it appears that one or more of the following must be true : ( 1 ) the circulation is not entirely steady , ( 2 ) the features that we measure do not all represent the same atmospheric level , ( 3 ) the feature tracked has evolved or been misidentified , or ( 4 ) the cloud features we track are not always at the same latitude as the cloud - generating circulation feature that is moving with the zonal flow .",
    "examples of the latter possibility are the companion clouds to neptune s great dark spot @xcite . in section [ sec : ab ]",
    "we provide examples from our current data set .",
    "if we weighted highly accurate measurements by their expected inverse variance , they would dominate the fit , leading to wild variations in regions where there are less accurate measurements .",
    "since these high accuracy measurements clearly do not all follow the mean flow , we must add an additional uncertainty to characterize their deviations from it .",
    "we do this by root sum squaring the estimated error of measurement with an additional error of representation denoted by @xmath26 , which is adjusted so that the @xmath25 value of the complete fit is approximately equal to the number of measurements .",
    "the need for @xmath26 might be partly due to slight discrepancies in latitude that arise from a cloud feature being generated by a circulation feature that is latitudinally offset from the bright cloud feature that is tracked .",
    "another factor in evaluating wind measurement accuracy is the rate at which latitudinal accuracy and drift rate accuracy improve with extended tracking time spans .",
    "drift rate accuracy improves roughly linearly with time span , and can improve dramatically from just a few widely separated measurements , while latitude accuracy improves as the square root of the number of measurements , and is not much improved by adding just a few measurements or by extending the time span of the measurements . if we consider a shear of 2/h per 10of latitude ( about the maximum observed shear ) , a half - degree error in latitude is equivalent to a 0.1/h error in wind measurement , which is about the value of @xmath26 that we need to make the value for the fit equal to the number of degrees of freedom ( or /n@xmath27 @xmath4 1 ) .",
    "the apparent local stair steps suggested by the binned wind profile would also cause local errors relative to a smooth profile .",
    "we found @xmath28 0.1/h for both the 2009 - 2011 and 2007 - 2011 data sets analyzed by @xcite . a similar value was needed in our current analysis .",
    "because our 2012 - 2014 wind data set contains such a sparse sampling of the southern hemisphere , with no samples poleward of 47s , it is difficult to reliably constrain any north - south asymmetry in the wind profile .",
    "accordingly , we first considered fits using a series of even legendre polynomials , which guarantees hemispheric symmetry and provides a useful reference for detecting asymmetries",
    ". to fit the relatively sharp kinks near 55n and 62n , we needed to use a fairly large number of polynomials . after finding fit problems with orders of 10 - 14 , we settled on a ten - term series of even polynomials up to order 18 .",

    "we also added synthetic points at both north and south poles to help straighten out our drift rate fit at high northern polar latitudes .",
    "we used a @xmath29 value of 0.147/h .",
    "the legendre coefficients and their uncertainties are given in table [ tbl : legfits ] .",
    "there we also provide coefficients for alternate fits discussed later in this section .    in comparison with our new symmetric fit",
    ", the prior asymmetric fit provides a degree of asymmetry in the 20- 40range that seems to provide slightly better agreement with the new observations in that region .",
    "but in the region from 55n to 85n , the old fit has a solid body rotation rate that is 0.2/h too fast .",
    "this might represent a slight decrease over time , but the small number of 2011 measurements and their error bars of 0.3/h or more , make this a difference of dubious significance . near the equator , our new fit has a lower eastward drift rate , which is a result of the large number of high quality 2014 measurements between -6and 1that pull the profile closer to zero . our new fit is not quite straight enough to fit the constant rotation rate observed at high northern latitudes , but is within about 0.1/h of the correct drift rate . near the equator",

    "his inferred westward drift rates rises from 3.8/h to 8.6/h , which is more than double what we measured at high northern latitudes , where drift rates are invariant with latitude over a comparable latitude range . given that the middle latitude winds have changed by barely measurable amounts from 1986 through 2014 , a 28-year period , it is hard to understand how such enormous seasonal changes might occur . if the north - south difference is seasonal , and the voyager analysis represents the winds at the southern summer solstice ( october 6 , 1985 ) , then we would expect that the same wind profile would appear in northern latitudes by the time of the northern summer solstice in 2030 ( on april 29 according to @xcite ) . that is less than 16 years",
    "over which this enormous change should occur , while almost nothing has changed at middle latitudes in the last 28 years .",
    "evidence for change at high latitudes is only beginning to be accumulated .",
    "there may have been a small decrease in the solid body rotation rate from 4.3/h to 4.1/h between 2011 and 2014 , but that is probably within the error of the 2011 measurements , and provides little evidence for the rapid change needed to match in 2030 what seems to have existed in 1986 in the southern hemisphere , according to @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , perhaps this north - south difference is a permanent feature of the wind profile , just as it appears that jupiter and saturn have asymmetries that survive over a complete change of seasons",
    ". it will certainly be worthwhile to monitor the winds of uranus over the next two decades to determine whether this asymmetry is really a seasonal effect .",
    "here we create a complete pole - to - pole zonal wind profile for uranus by combining results from groundbased observations at latitudes spanning 47s to 83n with the recent @xcite results for the southern hemisphere , obtained from 1986 voyager 2 imaging . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compositewinds ] we show our composite profile in comparison with binned observations and the discrete cloud tracking results of @xcite .",
    "the composite profile uses our symmetric fit to our 2012 - 2014 observations ( fig .",

    "we used a solid - body rotation profile of 4.1/h westward . from 47s to 90s",
    "we used the adopted profile of @xcite .",
    "the latter profile does not pass exactly through the discrete measurements in this region , probably because the profile also took into account correlation measurements .",
    "the composite profile is also provided in tables [ tbl : adoptdrate ] and [ tbl : adoptwind ] .",
    "this represents our best estimate of the zonal wind profile of uranus under the assumption that the indicated asymmetry is a permanent feature of the atmosphere .",
    "this may be an incorrect assumption . since the southern winds from voyager are based on 1986 observations , while the remaining winds ( from 47s to 90n ) are based on observations heavily weighted towards the 2012 - 2014 time period , this may not represent the current profile .",

    "compared to most other prominent northern - hemisphere features seen in 2014 , feature f was not particularly bright at near - ir wavelengths and did not extend to as high an altitude .",
    "it was not seen in k@xmath3 images , placing it deeper than the 1-bar level according to fig .",
    "[ fig : penprof ] , while several other 2014 features were spectacularly bright at that wavelength , with g being the most notable @xcite .",
    "yet , it was f that was detected by amateurs , probably because it had a substantially greater optical depth than surrounding clouds .",
    "feature f turned out to have an exceptionally long life and was tracked by amateurs as well as by hst observations using a too program 13712 ( k. sayanagi , pi ) and opal program 13937 ( a. simon , pi ) , and by observations from gemini , keck , and palomar , which are all summarized by @xcite .",
    "our model fit to its motions is displayed in fig .",
    "we first saw f in our 2014 keck images , but were not able to identify it in 2013 or 2012 images .",
    "this is not because of confusion about which feature is which .",
    "when we project our model backward we find no feature at all anywhere near the predicted location .",
    "thus it appears that f developed sometime between august 2013 and august 2014 .",
    "f also has an unusual morphology .",
    "it appears to have a very short plume extending to the west on its north side and a very extensive plume extending eastward over more than 100of longitude on its south side ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : rectpro ] and [ fig : featuresabcdfg ] ) .",
    "the direction of the plume is consistent with cloud particles spreading out from f mainly to the south , then following the zonal flow and falling behind the faster ( more westward ) motion of f. given the f - to - plume latitude distance of 3 - 4and the local wind shear of 0.084/h per degree of latitude ( from table  [ tbl : adoptdrate ] ) .",
    "the time to extend the plume 100of longitude would be 30 to 40 hours . of course the length of the plume is also limited by particle fallout , so the time span of convective activity and plume generation could of course have been much longer .",
    "the prominence of the f plume is a marker of its unusual convective strength relative to other features in similar shear regions that generate no plumes and is consistent with a large optical depth that would facilitate amateur detection of the feature .",
    "the last observation of this feature at the time of this writing was obtained on 8 january 2015 , using the gemini niri imager . at that time",
    "it did not appear to have a prominent plume , suggesting that its convective activity has substantially declined .",
    "it was found just 12east of the location predicted using the model in table 8 .",
    "long - lived features at nearby latitudes move at different longitudinal speeds and will eventually approach each other at close range , raising the possibility of some sort of interaction .",
    "an example of this occurred on 25 december 2011 , when two bright features separated by 2 in latitude had a close approach that resulted in formation of a small dark spot and companion clouds @xcite .",
    "a close approach observed on saturn @xcite resulted in a more dramatic development of bright clouds during the interaction .",
    "it is also possible that features might merge or dissipate .",
    "examples of dark spots merging on saturn can be found in fig .  3 of @xcite .",
    "if the features have underlying vortex circulations of similar vorticities , we might expect to see latitudinal deflections in opposite directions as they pass by each other , followed by a return to their original latitudes .",
    "it is less clear what changes to expect in the structure of their companion clouds .",
    "we found no evidence of strong interactions for the two feature pairs described below .",
    "long - term tracking of a and b features show that b has an average drift rate of -0.0597@xmath20.0002/h , while a has an average drift rate of -0.248@xmath20.002/h , with this average taken over a period from late august 2012 to 4 - 5 november 2012 .",
    "given that the winds become more westward at higher latitudes , the drift rate comparison suggests that the putative vortex generating the a features is actually north of the vortex generating the b features .",
    "this is consistent with the november 4 - 5 appearance of the features in fig .",
    "[ fig : featuresabcdfg ] .",
    "the long term tracking of these two features , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : abtrack ] , provides another surprising result .",
    "since their sizes ( judged by the extent of the bright clouds associated with them ) are somewhat greater than the latitudinal difference between them , we would expect some sort of interaction when they pass by each other .",
    "however , even though they reached the same longitude on september 7 , 2012 , their drift rates before and after that close encounter were not perceptibly changed . features a and b had three more close encounters before our next observing run on 15 - 16 august 2013 , yet they remained distinguishable features . however , there is considerable ambiguity as to what happened during the nearly 10 months without any observations . extending the drift track of these features to the august 2013 date",
    ", we find close approaches should have occurred on 5 december 2012 and 25 march 2013 .",
    "it is plausible that the multiple close approaches altered their latitudes and drift rates slightly , and our assumed model of a linear variation in latitude ( and in drift rate ) may not be correct .",
    "a non - uniformly varying drift rate has been observed for other long lived features on uranus , so this would not be surprising .",
    "it is also possible that one or both of the features disappeared during that unobserved period and that at least one of them in our 2013 images is a new feature .    also noteworthy , is that the latitudes we infer from our drift rate models interpolated to latitudes using the zonal profile of @xcite , suggest that feature a is following a circulation feature that is about 2n of the observed bright clouds and that feature b is following a circulation feature this is about 3s of the bright clouds associated with it . in this connection",
    "it is worth noting that the rectangular projections of a2 and b2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : featuresabcdfg ] for november 2012 ( 2nd row from bottom ) provide evidence of a dark spot associated with a that is north of the bright clouds accompanying it , and a dark spot associated with b that is south of the bright clouds accompanying it .",
    "the inferred separation of about 5 in latitude makes it somewhat more plausible that the features seem to suffer no major interactions .     and",

    "[ fig : featuresabcdfg ] ) , it would be surprising if they did not display evidence of some interaction .",
    "in fact , these were observed in such close proximity in hst images acquired on 14 october 2014 ( taken as part of a target of opportunity program , with kunio sayanagi as pi ) , that we initially thought we were observing a single feature .",
    "we also observed them in close proximity in a gemini niri image acquired on 19 november , about 1 day after close approach .",

    "besides the 14 october and 18 november approaches , we also found unobserved close approaches on 12 september 2014 and 20 december 2014 .",

    "the 2007 equinox observations @xcite provided the first detection of cloud features north of the 60n westward jet peak .",
    "more features were seen in 2011 images , and it appeared that the north polar region was peppered with small low - contrast discrete clouds @xcite , presenting what looked like a field of fair - weather cumulus convection on earth , but on a much larger scale .",
    "this was not expected because such features had never been seen in the south polar region . from 2012",
    "onward , the improved views of the north polar region of uranus have allowed us to combine observations from successive observing nights to form a complete picture of the polar region . because the entire region from about 63n to at least 83n moves in solid body rotation , we were able to average images with that rotation period removed to obtain a pole - centered high s / n view of uranus north polar region for each of the three years of observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : poleviews ] ) .",
    "these show a continued prevalence of large numbers of small bright features .",
    "almost all the polar bright features have similar size and shape , which is mainly circular .",

    "there are also less numerous but well - defined small dark spots , many of which are well separated from bright spots and thus can not be explained as an artifact of high - pass filtering .",
    "the small bright features have a typical contrast of 1 - 2% in the raw images , with a much brighter than typical feature in the 4 - 5 november image reaching 10% .",
    "the dark features have only a fraction of the contrast of the bright features ( as well as the opposite sign ) .",
    "the lifetimes of the polar features can extend for at least 1.5 planet rotations , as quite a few of these have been tracked over that time period ( not continuously , but with a one- rotation gap ) .",
    "the large number of features seen in the november 2012 data set seems to indicate the clear peak in activity . at a casual glance",
    "these spots appear to be fairly uniformly distributed in latitude and longitude , down to a latitude of about 55n , where there begins a transition to a morphology dominated by longitudinally stretched streaky features often occurring within long narrow regions of enhanced brightness with a width comparable to the diameter of the small polar spots .",
    "however , there is a pattern in the distribution of features that has at least some crude year - to - year consistency , as discussed in section  [ sec : polepat ] .",
    "+     it is worth recalling , as demonstrated in fig . 1 of @xcite , that when the south polar region was imaged in 2003 , using the same telescope , camera , and essentially similar ao system , no discrete polar features of any kind were observed between 50s and the south pole .",
    "that observation was made in southern hemisphere fall , while the current observations were made during northern hemisphere spring .",
    "one might surmise that this seasonal difference is the cause of this striking morphological asymmetry .",
    "a long season of radiative cooling from the top of the atmosphere during uranus northern winter might tend to produce an unstable thermal profile that favors vertical mixing , which is likely to be most active following equinox . on the other hand",
    ", the long summer of heating from above during southern hemisphere summer might stabilize the thermal profile and inhibit vertical convection in southern polar regions in the fall .",
    "although this has a plausible ring to it , there are other indicators of vertical convection , such as depleted methane mixing ratios in both polar regions at the same time @xcite , which argues against such seasonal modulations in at least the large scale flow .",
    "we are expecting that this `` convective '' activity might continue for a while as the northern hemisphere moves into summer , but it is plausible to expect it to eventually dissipate as summer heating intensifies .",
    "we also expect the formation of a polar cap cloud @xcite , which appears to have begun @xcite .",

    "there may be a connection between the numerous small , apparently convective , cloud features in the north polar region of uranus , and its circulation being solid - body over the region where this suggested convection occurs .",
    "if the static stability ( as measured by its brunt - vaisala frequency or its rossby deformation radius @xmath67 @xcite ) were large , then the planetary east - west flow would be expected to act as if were two - dimensional and quasi - geostrophic ( qg ) @xcite . in the mid - latitudes between 10and 60 in both hemispheres",
    ", we can show that the mean east - west flow is well - approximated with a qg model with an @xmath68  km and with a weak potential vorticity gradient , in accord with @xcite .",
    "a qg model does not approximate the flow well in the region of the equatorial jet , where the coriolis parameter passes through zero and where the east - west flow is likely to be more three - dimensional and driven by cellular motions such as a hadley cell @xcite .",
    "in addition , a qg model does not approximate the near solid - body rotation that we observe at the north polar region of uranus . on the other hand ,",
    "if the north polar region has low static stability with intermittent , local convection and/or baroclinic instabilities , as suggested by the region s profuse clouds and by the fact that it recently passed from winter to summer ( see section  [ sec : polemorph ] ) , then there is reason to expect that solid - body rotation would develop there .    in modeling stars , it was traditionally believed that the turbulent mixing within convection zones made the convective regions of stars rotate as solid bodies @xcite .",
    "in fact , a number of different authors have argued that in convectively stable regions of stars with internal gravity waves or with baroclinic instabilities , such as the goldreich - schubert - fricke instability , the flow is driven to solid - body rotation @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the rotation curves in our sun , using helioseismology ( c.f . , fig .  5 in @xcite ) show a more complex picture of rotation . solar observations , along with three - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite in which there is mixing , show that only polar regions within 20 30of the poles rotate as solid bodies .",
    "although there is differential rotation in the outermost surface of the sun , deeper , at the boundary of the convection zone and the radiative region ( which is a nearly spherical surface with constant pressure ) , there is near solid - body rotation .",
    "( see the comparison between the surfaces of constant rotation and the location of the convective zone boundary in fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "because we expect that clouds that we use in determining the east - west velocities or uranus are located near the boundary of its convective and radiative zones , it is the differential ( or lack thereof ) rotation curve at this boundary that is relevant to us .    a simple argument by @xcite based on weak instability and the thermal wind equation explains the solid - body rotation at the poles and differential rotation elsewhere .",
    "his original argument required that the weak instability be due to magnetic fields , but later showed that _ any _ weak instability , including convective or baroclinic , would suffice @xcite .",
    "the decrease in the static stability at the north pole of uranus due to the cooling of the atmosphere during winter over the long season of darkness may be sufficient to allow weak , new baroclinic instabilities to form or old instabilities to strengthen and cause the north polar region to rotate as a solid body during its winter and spring .",
    "if this connection between solid body rotation and weak static stability is valid , then as the north polar region of uranus passes into summer , we would expect to observe a decrease in the number of clouds at the north polar region and an increase in its differential rotation .",
    "future observations should be capable of testing this hypothesis .",
    "the angular velocity acceleration needed to transform the polar circulation from the solid body form seen in north polar spring to the more complex form seen at southern hemisphere solstice might be produced by vertical advection of angular momentum from below or from poleward meridional motions , for which conservation of angular momentum would tend to increase angular velocity with decreasing distance to the pole . whether such a transformation actually takes place , and how effective these mechanisms might be in producing",
    "the speculated transformation remains to be determined .",
    "we reported on the analysis of an extensive data set of high - quality ao images acquired from keck and gemini observatories from 2012 through 2014 .",
    "further enhancement of image quality was obtained by averaging multiple images in a body fixed coordinate system , allowing the improvement of signal to noise ratios while avoiding the smear due to planet rotation .",
    "our results are summarized below .    1 .   we made over 850 measurements of cloud features in high - s / n images from 2012 , 2013 , and 2014 .",
    "these are heavily weighted towards the northern hemisphere not only because the sub - earth and sub - solar latitudes were in the northern hemisphere , but also because uranus produced more cloud features there .",
    "the number of trackable cloud features in 2014 was exceptionally large compared to other years .",
    "gemini observations produced far fewer trackable features than keck observations , mainly due to the higher performance of the keck ao system as a result of its ability to use uranus as a wave - front reference .",
    "2 .   these observations revealed an active polar region , with many small cloud features of 600 - 800 km , comparable to the keck telescope s resolution .",
    "most of the features are bright , but a number of dark features were also seen of about the same size and mainly circular shape .",
    "these features are found between the north pole and about 55n .",
    "the small polar cloud features were seen in every year of high - s / n observations , but were most apparent in 4 - 5 november 2012 observations , where they seemed to have higher contrast and greater numbers .",
    "a sizable fraction of these features lived long enough to track on successive nights , providing an accurate determination of their wind speeds .",
    "our new measurements firmly established that the high - latitude zonal winds of uranus , between 60n and at least 83n , closely adhere to solid - body rotation at a rate of 4.08@xmath20.015/h westward relative to body - fixed coordinates .",
    "when winds are plotted in units of m / s , the transition to solid - body rotation appears as a zonal jet with a peak velocity of 260 m / s westward 4 .",
    "we were able to fill in details of the zonal profile in the 12n - 30n region , which has been under - sampled in prior data sets .",
    "5 .   binned wind measurements show a stair - step appearance at middle latitudes , suggesting that the wind profile may not be an entirely smooth function of latitude .",
    "we discovered a substantial difference between the near - equatorial motions of waves and those of small discrete cloud features , with the former moving at a speed of 0.4/h eastward and the latter at a speed of 0.1/h eastward .",
    "this may mean that the equatorial mass flow is much slower than previously inferred and that the waves move eastward faster than the zonal flow by 0.3/h .",
    "three symmetric ( even order ) legendre polynomial fits were derived from the new wind observations .",
    "one is based on essentially the entire data set .",
    "a second is based on observations including the wave motions but excluding the small discrete feature tracking that was obtained from the 2014 observations , and a third is based on observations that exclude the wave motion measurements .",
    "we also found that the preponderance of current and past observations are consistent with a north - south mid - latitude asymmetry in the zonal wind profile of uranus . using an asymmetric model to characterize this difference",
    ", we find that the maximum asymmetry amplitude is 0.09/h when all high accuracy observations from voyager onward are included , and 0.135/h , when all but 2012 - 2104 observations are included , with the main asymmetries peaking near @xmath230 .",
    "it appears that the asymmetry has decreased with time .",
    "we did not include in this analysis the enormous high - latitude asymmetry implied by the recent reanalysis of voyager images by @xcite .",
    "although there are no hst or groundbased wind measurements at high southern latitudes ( 50s - 90s ) , a recent reanalysis of 1986 voyager 2 uranus observations by @xcite has yielded wind results there that are very different from northern winds at corresponding northern latitudes .",
    "this large north - south asymmetry might be seasonal .",
    "however , only minimal changes have been seen in the north polar region between 2011 and 2014 , and at middle latitudes only tiny changes have been seen since 1986 .",
    "this argues against a large seasonal change in polar winds , though it can not be ruled out .",
    "we found two types of equatorial wave features .",
    "one type , seen in prior observations , as well as in our more recent observations , are diffuse bright features a few degrees north of the equator , spaced about 30to 40apart in longitude .",
    "the other kind of wave feature , not observed prior to these high s / n observations , is a transverse wave marked by a dark ribbon with a latitudinal width of about 1and a longitudinal wavelength of about 20 .",
    "however , the transverse wave amplitude , which is of the order of several degrees of latitude over about half of the planet s circumference , damps to nearly zero over the remaining longitude range .",
    "we found that zonal averages of brightness of polar cloud features has a latitudinal pattern in which brightness minima occur near 53.5n , 61n , 71.5n , and 78n .",
    "this is a good match to the apparent mixing ratio variations inferred by @xcite .",
    "more obvious patterns are seen at lower latitudes , but most are only visible with high - pass filtering . 12 .",
    "zonal maps made from images acquired on successive nights in august 2012 , november 2012 , august 2013 , and august 2014 , show persistent patterns , and six easily distinguished long - lived cloud features , which we were able to track for long periods that ranged from 5 months to over two years .",
    "two at similar latitudes are associated with dark spots , and move with the atmospheric zonal flow close to the location of their associated dark spot instead of following the flow at the latitude of the bright features .",
    "these features retained their morphologies and drift rates in spite of several close interactions .",
    "a second pair of features at similar latitudes also survived several close approaches .",
    "several of the long - lived features also exhibited equatorward drifts and latitudinal oscillations .",
    "13 . among the high - altitude features , based on their visibility in k@xmath3 images",
    ", we find that b and c reached pressures less than one bar , and thus are likely at least partly composed of methane ice .",
    "no features reached that level in the southern hemisphere .",
    "we suspect that feature a reached that level in 2012 , but lacking any k@xmath3 images from that period we would need a full radiative transfer analysis to confirm it .",
    "there is a correlation between the region of polar `` convective '' cloud forms and the region of solid body rotation , both extending from about 60n to at least 83n .",
    "there are dynamical reasons to expect that these might be related , and that when the convection subsides , the winds might also change .    as uranus moves towards its 2030 northern hemisphere summer solstice ,",
    "a large seasonal shift in wind speeds should occur if the recent results of @xcite for the southern hemisphere indicate a seasonal asymmetry .",
    "what also might happen is that the cloud features that we currently use to track motions in this region either disappear or become obscured by an overlying haze , a result suggested by the fact that we have never seen near - ir cloud features in the south polar region .",
    "we can only hope that any seasonal changes will become observable before the tracers we use to observe them disappear .",

    "<S> these noise - reduced images revealed many low - contrast discrete features and large scale cloud patterns not seen before , including scalloped waveforms just south of the equator , and an associated transverse ribbon wave near 6s . in all three years numerous small ( 600 - 700 km wide ) and mainly bright discrete features were seen within the north polar region ( north of about 55n ) . </S>",

    "<S> over 850 wind measurements were made , the vast majority of which were in the northern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> winds at high latitudes were measured with great precision , revealing an extended region of solid body rotation between 62n and at least 83n , at a rate of 4.08@xmath0/h westward relative to the planet s interior ( radio ) rotation of 20.88/h westward . </S>",
    "<S> near - equatorial speeds measured with high accuracy give different results for waves and small discrete features , with eastward drift rates of 0.4/h and 0.1/h respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the region of polar solid body rotation is a close match to the region of small - scale polar cloud features , suggesting a dynamical relationship . </S>",
    "<S> the winds from prior years and those from 2012 - 2014 are consistent with a mainly symmetric wind profile up to middle latitudes , with a small asymmetric component of @xmath10.09/h peaking near @xmath230 , and about 60% greater amplitude if only prior years are included , suggesting a declining mid - latitude asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> while winds at high southern latitudes ( 50s - 90s ) are unconstrained by groundbased observations , a recent reanalysis of 1986 voyager 2 observations by karkoschka ( 2015 , icarus 250 , 294 - 307 ) has revealed an extremely large north - south asymmetry in this region , which might be seasonal . </S>",
