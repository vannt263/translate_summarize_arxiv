    "as the contributions from all plaquettes are summed up , the internal space  the sphere described by the spin variables  is covered and if periodic boundary conditions are used one obtains an integer charge signifying the number of times this sphere is ` wrapped ' . the topological susceptibility evaluated with this charge definition ( and the standard action ) completely failed to scale @xcite .",

    "it is called field theoretical or plaquette definition and uses a ` naive ' discretization of the continuum charge operator .",
    "this prescription does not yield integer values and to obtain continuum results renormalization factors are needed . for large @xmath9 these factors can be determined perturbatively , but for intermediate @xmath9 one has to use non  perturbative techniques @xcite .",
    "results obtained with the field theoretical charge indicate for the susceptibility a behaviour consistent with scaling @xcite .",
    "a serious problem in these approaches is the role of the lattice artifacts , sensitive both to the form of the lattice action and the choice of the topological charge .",
    "a recent work @xcite suggests to use the fp action of a renormalization group transformation to study topological effects .",
    "in particular , an important feature is that the fp action has scale invariant instanton solutions ( with an action value exactly @xmath11 ) , and hence  as will be discussed in this paper  one can define a topological charge with no lattice defects . in ref .",
    "@xcite and here the o(3 ) @xmath0model is considered , but the methods apply to other asymptotically free theories as well .",
    "the su(3 ) gauge theory has been studied in refs .",
    "a subsequent paper by one of us @xcite , will deal with the application of these ideas to @xmath12 models and in particular to the @xmath13 model .",
    "some of our results were already presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we review some results derived in ref .",
    "@xcite and define the fp field operator .",
    "this is followed by a closer look at instantons in the continuum , in a finite periodic volume and finally on a lattice using the fp action .",
    "we then define the fp topological charge and present some numerical results on classical solutions . in the last section we analyze the topological susceptibility evaluated in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "after a brief description of the methods used , we present the results which are followed by a conclusion and an outlook .",
    "let us briefly summarize some rg results which were developed in a previous paper @xcite .",
    "for a detailed discussion we refer the reader to this paper .",
    "we consider the o(3 ) non  linear @xmath0model in two  dimensional euclidean space defined on a square lattice .",
    "the partition function reads as follows @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the o(3 ) invariant measure @xmath16 and @xmath17 is a regularization of the continuum action @xmath18    we perform exact rg transformations by a kadanoff type of blocking , i.e.  we divide the lattice into @xmath19 blocks labeled by indices @xmath20 .",
    "to each block we define a block spin variable @xmath21 which is some mean of the spin variables @xmath22 in the block .",
    "the block spins @xmath21 form a lattice whose spacing is twice as large as the original one .",
    "an effective action is defined by integration over the original lattice : @xmath23 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the kernel of the rg transformation and its normalization @xmath25 ensures the invariance of the partition function under this transformation . in the classical limit",
    "@xmath26 the path integral is dominated by its saddle point : @xmath27 the transformation kernel used in ref .",
    "@xcite has in the limit @xmath28 the simple form : @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a free positive parameter of the rg transformation , which is tuned to make the fp action as compact as possible .",
    "as indicated by the free field theory in one dimension , the choice @xmath31 gives the most short  ranged fp action .",
    "a fixed point of the transformation satisfies the equation @xmath32 this equation  called fp equation  fixes for arbitrary configurations @xmath33 the value of the fp action .",
    "starting from a lattice regularization of the continuum action repeated rg transformations will drive the effective action to its fixed point .",
    "this takes on the form of a minimization in a multigrid of lattice configurations : @xmath34    -5 mm    on each successive level  see figure  [ levels ]  the spin configurations become smoother , not only because the lattice spacing is halved , but also because the minimization tends to smooth out the fluctuations around a solution to the equations of motion .",
    "hence one may choose for the action @xmath35 on the finest configuration @xmath36 any lattice discretization of the continuum action .",
    "the fp action @xmath37 is then obtained as the limit of @xmath38 of @xmath39 . for practical purposes , however ,",
    "only a few levels are needed and starting from the standard action on the lowest level the fp value is reached soon .      in principle the above multigrid approach can be used to evaluate the fp action for arbitrary configurations to any precision desired . for practical calculations , however , a parametrization of the fp action is needed . in ref .",
    "@xcite a parametrization has been obtained by fitting the known values of the action for @xmath40 configurations .",
    "that parametrization represented well the fp action on those configurations .",
    "however , to control the topological effects better , we decided to improve the parametrization further by including some small size topological solutions in the fitting procedure .",
    "we used several two  instanton solutions of the lattice fp action . while improving the fit for these instanton solutions",
    ", the new parametrization does not affect the quality of the fit for the previous configurations .",
    "the resulting couplings are given in table  [ newcouplings ]  together with a graphical notation of the corresponding operators .",
    "let us explain here again the meaning of this notation .",
    "the parametrization of the action has the form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the angle between the two spins @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "two dots connected with a line    ( 22,6)(0,0 ) ( 2,3 ) ( 20,3 ) ( 2,3)(1,0)18    represent a factor @xmath45 in the action and the positions of the dots represent the lattice sites @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "double , triple connected dots stand for the square , cube of the above factors .",
    "the operator , finally , is the product of all the factors @xmath45 as indicated by the lines in the figure .",
    "the quadratic and quartic couplings # 1,2,4,5,7,10,16 and 19 are determined analytically @xcite , the others were determined with a numerical fitting procedure with the new instanton configurations added .",

    "the proof is quite simple : if @xmath33 is at a local minimum of the fp action , variations with respect to @xmath33 will vanish : @xmath150 here @xmath151 is the solution of the fp equation with @xmath152 as coarse input configuration . since @xmath152 is a local minimum eq .",

    "consequently , any sensible definition of the topological charge can be used on these configurations , the final result will not depend on this choice . nevertheless , it is more convenient to use the geometric definition since it is stable against small variations of the field and hence @xmath73 , the number of levels in the multigrid minimization could be kept small with this definition . for a review of the geometric definition",

    "( [ 31 ] ) follows then by observing that the contribution of the @xmath24 terms in eq .",
    "( [ fp - equation ] ) is non  negative .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the numerical aspects of classical solutions .      following the above program we naively discretize two  instanton solutions on the torus of various sizes on very fine lattices .",
    "we found that four to five blocking steps are sufficient to make any lattice artifacts of the original discretization negligible . on the finally blocked configurations we can measure several quantities . on the coarse configuration itself",

    "it is gratifying to see that the fp charge immediately falls off to zero , as the fp action drops below the continuum value .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ rhovar ] demonstrates how well the parametrization for the fp action is suited for instanton configurations .",
    "the deviation from the exact value is quite small , in particular the parametrized fp action is only marginally smaller than the continuum value in the region above the point where the instanton falls through the lattice .",
    "in contrast , the values of the standard action are quite different from the continuum ones .",
    "these numerical findings support the above statement , that there are no dangerous dislocations present when using the fp action together with the fp topological charge .",

    " analytic break at @xmath175 .",
    "our parametrization does not fully reproduce this behaviour , and so one might expect that observable deviations will occur in this instanton region .",
    "we systematically searched for minimal action configurations with a parametrized action lower than the continuum value in the @xmath176 sector .",
    "we found a minimal action of @xmath177 ( compare this with the value @xmath178 we found using the standard action and geometric charge ) .",
    "this value can be ascribed to the not exactly accurate parametrization of the fp field .",
    "if we actually solve the fp equation ( [ fp - equation ] ) for this ` dislocation configuration ' we get the correct charge @xmath179",
    ". nevertheless , as one has to use parametrizations for monte carlo simulations , such configurations could be dangerous .",
    "on the other hand , the search for dislocations reveals the weakest point of the parametrization which performs very well in other cases ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ rhovar ] ) .",
    "what actually counts is not how the parametrization works for some configurations that were specially sought for their bad performance , but how well it performs for configurations in thermal equilibrium occurring in a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the results of a test of this performance  presented in section  [ results ]  shows that indeed there is no problem .",
    "we also searched for the minimal action configuration in the @xmath180 sector and did not find a configuration with an action below the continuum action .",
    "this is not astonishing as there are no one  instanton solutions on a torus .",
    "if the topological susceptibility is a well defined physical quantity that is renormalization group invariant , then one expects that it scales like a @xmath181 in the continuum limit .",
    "one additionally measures a second quantity , e.g. the correlation length @xmath182 and builds the dimensionless product @xmath183 which should go to a constant in the limit @xmath184 .",
    "earlier monte carlo calculations do not show convincingly whether this is the case . furthermore , perturbative considerations indicate that in the o(3 ) model there might be a problem with the topological susceptibility in the continuum limit .",
    "one may calculate the contribution of instantons in the continuum using a semiclassical expansion . the probability density to find an instanton with topological charge @xmath185 and size",

    "the infrared divergence at @xmath190 in eq .",
    "( [ scaleint ] ) indicates , however , that this assumption is not true : small instantons are not suppressed , but contribute strongly to the susceptibility .",
    "such a dominance of small instantons is also indicated by numerical studies , trying to determine the instanton size distribution with different methods @xcite .    on the lattice ,",
    "however , not the whole range of the instanton radius is probed .",
    "the lattice cuts the contribution of small instantons because there is a smallest possible radius before the instanton falls through the lattice ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ rhovar ] ) .",
    "hence the measured topological susceptibility is always finite .",
    "it is not excluded , however , that it raises boundlessly with increasing correlation length as the perturbative considerations suggest .      using the perfect lattice action and the perfect charge we performed extensive monte carlo simulations at correlation lengths in the range @xmath191 . in order to avoid finite size effects we kept the ratio @xmath192 constant .",
    "the correlation length was obtained from the long distance fall off of the zero momentum correlation function .",
    "we determined the topological charge using both the geometric definition and the definition of the fp charge given in section  [ tcharge ] .",
    "for the measurement of the fp charge we used the geometric definition of the charge on a finer lattice of the multigrid with the monte carlo generated lattice as coarsest level . to determine the configuration @xmath193 on the fine lattice one can either minimize the fp equation ( which is very time consuming ) or use the parametrization of the dependence on @xmath75 given in section  [ parfield ] .",
    "we denote the corresponding charges @xmath194 for the geometric charge , @xmath195 for the charge measured on the first finer level using the parametrization of the fine field etc .    for two @xmath9 values we compared the results of using the parametrization on a finer level and of minimizing on a multigrid . as is shown in table  [ test ] , the results were found to be consistent within the statistical errors .",
    "this confirms , that the parametrization performs well for configurations occurring in a monte carlo simulation ( c.f .",
    "the discussion at the end of section  [ classres ] ) . in order to test",
    "if the result of going to a lower level is already stable , we also calculated the charge for a few @xmath9 values on the second finer lattice .",
    "as also can be seen in table  [ test ] , the values on the first and the second finer level were found to be consistent within the statistical errors .",
    "thus it is sufficient to calculate the fine field only on the first finer level .",
    "this is not astonishing as the maximal angle between two neighbouring spins halves as one goes one step down to a finer level .",
