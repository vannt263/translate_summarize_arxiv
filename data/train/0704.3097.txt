    "large , bright , elliptical galaxies are found at the centres of most galaxy clusters .",
    "these brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are the most luminous stellar systems known , yet their intrinsic luminosities are remarkably uniform .",
    "their luminosity and photometric uniformity mean that they do not appear to be the bright extension of the luminosity function of other cluster galaxies @xcite .",
    "the position of these galaxies at the centre of clusters and their unique properties link their formation and evolution to that of their environment .",
    "however , the mechanisms behind their growth are still poorly understood .",
    "hierarchical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ; henceforth dlb ) suggest that these most massive galaxies should have assembled more recently than other galaxies , with those in the densest environments of galaxy clusters being at a later stage in their evolution to those in the lower density environments of galaxy groups . understanding the processes by which these galaxies form and evolve is , therefore , vital to the understanding of how both galaxies and clusters form and subsequently evolve .    the studies of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite compared the @xmath1-band properties of bcgs with the x - ray luminosities of their host clusters .",
    "near - infrared luminosities are dominated by long - lived stars , such that these wavebands are more sensitive to the underlying stellar mass of galaxies than shorter wavelengths .",
    "cluster x - ray luminosity is directly proportional to the square of the density of the intra - cluster medium and provides a quantitative and objective measure of environmental density . @xcite",
    "observed that bcgs in the most x - ray luminous clusters ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 [ @xmath4 kev ] ) have uniform absolute magnitudes ( after correction for passive evolution ) over redshifts @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that they have not experienced any significant stellar mass evolution , beyond that expected for passive evolution , since a redshift @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , the absolute magnitudes of bcgs in less x - ray luminous clusters show significant scatter suggesting that they have increased their mass by up to a factor @xmath7 over the same timescale .",
    "an analysis of the structure of the low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) bcgs adds further evidence of environmentally dependent evolution : bcgs in high-@xmath9 clusters have larger radii with fainter mean surface brightnesses than those in low-@xmath9 clusters @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the bcgs in high-@xmath9 clusters have undergone more accretion than those in low-@xmath9 clusters .",
    "taken together with the analysis of the magnitudes , these results suggest that bcgs in high - mass clusters assembled their stellar mass at redshifts @xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath11 gyrs ago ) , and have been passively evolving since , in contrast to bcgs in low - mass clusters which appear to still be in the process of assembling today .",
    "this picture is consistent with models of hierarchical structure formation .",
    "another important prediction of the hierarchical structure formation model is that bcgs originate in groups - where they are the brightest group galaxies ( bggs ) , generally observed to be large ellipticals @xcite .",
    "as the groups fall into clusters , the bgg sinks to the bottom of the potential well by dynamical friction and merges with the central galaxy . in @xcite we found that , while the luminosity of the bgg correlates with its total group luminosity , the fraction of group luminosity contained in the bgg decreases with increasing total group luminosity .",
    "this suggests that bggs themselves grow in step with their host group , but at a slower rate than the group .",
    "these observations give indirect evidence for the hierarchical structure formation paradigm with bcgs in low - mass clusters having undergone accretion events since @xmath12 , possibly from mergers with infalling bggs .",
    "however , confirming the paradigm requires direct evidence that bcgs have undergone mergers .",
    "we can use the predictions of dlb to do this in a quantitative fashion .",
    "their study uses merger trees from the millennium cosmological n - body simulation @xcite as an input for their semi - analytic model which includes a model for the suppression of cooling flows by agn feedback .",
    "the model is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "dlb predict that the stars that will end up in the bcg form at high redshift ( with 50 per cent of the stars having formed by @xmath13 , i.e. they are now @xmath14 gyrs old ) , the bcgs then evolve through the accretion of old , passive galaxies of mass@xmath15 , with @xmath16 per cent of the mass of the eventual bcg not _ assembling _ until @xmath17 , i.e. @xmath18 gyrs ago .",
    "the late mergers are not predicted to significantly change the ages or metallicities of the bcgs because the progenitor galaxies are predicted to be massive , old , metal - rich , gas - poor galaxies themselves .",
    "dlb also show that the bcg mass grows in step with the growth in mass of the cluster .",
    "we therefore assume that observing bcgs in clusters with a range in mass ( down to group - sized systems ) is equivalent to observing them at different stages in their evolutionary history .",
    "the stellar populations of galaxies provide us with a means by which to determine their evolutionary histories .",
    "the populations are a result of many factors including the efficiency of star formation , gas fraction , gas dissipation and possible interactions with other galaxies .",
    "this information should leave imprints in the radial distributions of these populations and the different models of galaxy formation make different predictions of the radial dependence of the stellar populations :    in classic models of dissipative collapse ( e.g. @xcite ) , stars form during the collapse and remain in their orbits , while gas dissipates to the centre of the galaxy , being continually enriched by the evolving stars as it does so .",
    "this results in stars in the centres of galaxies being more metal - rich than those in the outer regions . in the models",
    "the degree of dissipation is controlled by the size of the potential well .",
    "the continuous enrichment by evolving stars means that the centres are less @xmath0-element enhanced ( i.e. the ratio of the abundance of @xmath0-elements to the abundance of iron - peak elements is @xmath19 solar ; @xcite ) than the outer regions , unless the collapse , and star formation , occur over very short timescales .",
    "the observed central @xmath0-element enhancement ratios in galaxies require collapse times @xmath20 gyr @xcite .",
    "more recent numerical models of dissipative collapse ( e.g. @xcite ) show that the observed chemical abundances can be obtained by assuming that metallicity gradients are established by the onset of a galactic wind which varies depending on the local depth of the potential well .",
    "dissipative collapse , therefore predicts strong negative metallicity gradients ( i.e. metallicity decreases with increasing radius ) that correlate with galaxy mass @xcite , negative @xmath0-element enhancement gradients , and small positive to null age gradients ( due to the speed of the collapse ) .",
    "simulations of the hierarchical formation of galaxies ( e.g. dlb , @xcite ) predict that massive elliptical galaxies are produced by mergers .",
    "early numerical simulations of the properties of merger remnants suggested that mergers lead to a flattening of the metallicity gradients @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the gradients of the progenitor galaxies are not heavily affected as violent relaxation preserves the position of the stars in the local potential .",
    "more recent simulations including gas physics suggest that the gradients of the remnant depend on the amount of gas present in the merger .",
    "the predicted signatures of gaseous ( dissipative ) mergers are qualitatively similar to the dissipative collapse models described above as a significant fraction of the gas in the progenitor galaxies is funnelled towards the central regions of the merger remnant , resulting in a starburst @xcite .",
    "starbursts can also produce metallicity gradients , although those produced by @xcite in their dissipative merger simulation are shallower than those found for dissipative collapse models .",
    "@xcite simulated the formation of ellipticals in a cold - dark matter cosmology , examining the effects of dissipative collapse , and dissipative and dissipationless mergers on the chemodynamical evolution of ellipticals .",
    "she found that galaxies of given mass had steep metallicity gradients if formed by collapse and shallower gradients ( a few gyrs after the merger ) if formed by a major merger ( dissipative or not ) .",
    "therefore , hierarchical galaxy formation models predict negative metallicity gradients that are shallower than those predicted by dissipative collapse models . depending on the duration and location of the starburst and the original @xmath0-element enhancement of the gas ,",
    "the resulting @xmath0-element enhancement ratio and age gradients of the merger remnant can be either positive or negative ( e.g. @xcite )    if environment has an effect on the star formation , the number of interactions a galaxy undergoes , or the dissipation of gas within the galaxy s potential well , we would expect to see an environmental dependence on the inferred stellar population gradients .",
    "the theoretical models indicate that the radial structure of a galaxy provides a fossil record of its evolutionary history .",
    "therefore , studying the radial kinematics and stellar populations of bggs and bcgs and their dependence on environment will enable us to determine their merger history . if the predictions of dlb are correct we would expect to see evidence of dissipationless mergers in these galaxies ; i.e. little dependence of metallicity on system mass and no evidence of star formation in the last 5 gyrs . as the bcgs",
    "are predicted to be at a later stage of their evolution than the bggs , we would also expect evidence that the bcgs have undergone more mergers than the bggs .",
    "this would predict , for example , shallower metallicity gradients in the bcgs and the velocity dispersions of the bggs / bcgs increasing with increasing group / cluster mass .",
    "there have been few studies of the kinematics and stellar populations of bcgs and fewer that are spatially resolved to enable a study of radial trends .",
    "@xcite found the bcg in the fornax cluster , ngc 1399 , to be old ( @xmath21 gyrs ) . in studies of radial gradients",
    ", @xcite found that the mg@xmath22 gradients of 3 bcgs are shallower than the mean gradient of normal ellipticals , suggesting that bcgs have undergone more mergers than normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found the d4000 gradients of 6 bcgs to be steeper than for non - bcgs , suggesting that bcgs experienced dissipative collapse and can not have formed solely through mergers with passive galaxies .",
    "the study of 13 bcgs by @xcite found that the velocity dispersion profiles of bcgs were similar to those in normal elliptical galaxies . @xcite examined the line strengths of 9 of the 13 bcgs presented in @xcite and found that bcgs follow the same mg@xmath23  velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 metallicity  mass ) and [ mg / fe ]  velocity dispersion ( @xmath24 @xmath0-element enhancement  mass ) relationships as normal elliptical galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath25 gradients of their sample are flat , and combined with declining mg@xmath23 gradients , suggest that bcgs are younger in their centres than in their outer regions .",
    "@xcite found similar results in their sample of 3 bcgs .",
    "@xcite calculated stellar population gradients for the two cd galaxies in the coma cluster , finding shallow age gradients , shallow metallicity gradients , and no @xmath0-element enhancement ratio gradients , consistent with their results of other early - type galaxies in coma .",
    "the results from metallicity gradients are clearly contradictory while the other relationships are generally consistent with bcgs sharing similar properties and , therefore , a similar evolutionary history , to normal early - type galaxies . however",
    ", these samples only cover a limited environmental range and only a few studies have data that extend to the effective radius ( @xmath26 ; the radius containing half the light ) of these galaxies .",
    "in this paper we test whether bcgs evolve hierarchically by examining high signal - to - noise , gemini long - slit spectra for a sample of 3 bggs and 3 bcgs in x - ray groups and clusters spanning an unprecedented range in x - ray luminosity and hence environmental density ( @xmath27 ergs@xmath28 ) .",
    "our aim is not to compare bggs with bcgs ; instead we are using the range in system x - ray luminosity to observe these galaxies at different stages in their evolutionary history . observing the same systems over a range of look - back times would require going to redshifts that are too high for a detailed stellar population analysis to be conducted .",
    "however , we do note that it is possible that these galaxies are at different stages of their evolution and _ also _ in different environments .",
    "if this is so then we might expect the properties of bggs and bcgs to show scatter in their relationships and not to depend on their environment .",
    "we build on previous studies by examining galaxies in a wider range of environments and by measuring their spectral properties out to at least 1 effective radius .",
    "we also use the multi - index @xmath29-fitting technique of proctor & sansom ( 2002 ; see also @xcite ) to measure their stellar populations .",
    "the rationale behind this technique is that all the indices defined in the lick system have _ some _ sensitivity to both age _ and _ metallicity .",
    "using them all together , in conjunction with the best available single stellar population ( ssp ) models , overcomes uncertainties in both the data reduction and from the ssp models themselves .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that this method is significantly more reliable than the more widely - used technique of using only single or a few indices at a time .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers studying the kinematics and stellar populations , and their gradients , in bggs and bcgs . at present",
    "we only have a small sample of 6 galaxies .",
    "it is therefore not possible to determine whether these galaxies follow statistically significant correlations .",
    "however , the sample is useful for an initial identification of trends that might be germane to the aforementioned issues .",
    "we introduce our sample in section  [ section_sample ] and the observations made and data reduction process in section  [ section_obs ] . in section  [ section_analysis ]",
    "we discuss our method for extracting the kinematics , lick indices and ages and metallicities for these data . in section  [ section_indiv_gals ]",
    "we discuss the results we obtain for individual galaxies before studying the relationships between the sample in section  [ section_env ] ( environment ) , section  [ section_central ] ( central stellar populations ) and section  [ section_grads ] ( stellar population gradients ) .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ section_conc ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath30 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the bgg and bcg galaxy samples were selected from the group evolution multi - wavelength study ( gems ; @xcite ) and the bcg sample presented in @xcite . in both these samples",
    "the galaxy is selected as the brightest galaxy closest to the x - ray centroid , i.e. closest to the centre of the potential well of these structures .",
    "the specific galaxies were chosen to be accessible within the gemini telescope s ` a ' ( february  july ) observing semester and to cover a wide range in group / cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "the sample of galaxies studied and the properties of their host group / cluster systems are summarised in table  [ sample_table ] .",
    "the absolute magnitudes given in table  [ sample_table ] are calculated from the total @xmath33-band magnitudes ( henceforth denoted as @xmath1 ) given in the 2-micron all sky survey extended source catalogue ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are no independent distance measurements for our bcgs .",
    "we , therefore , convert to absolute magnitudes using luminosity distances ( given in table  [ sample_table ] ) calculated from the measured central recession velocities and our choice of cosmology . due to the scatter in the absolute magnitudes of this sample",
    ", it makes no difference to our results if we use luminosity distances for the bggs or those based on distance moduli from surface brightness fluctuation studies by @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes are then k+e - corrected ( i.e. also corrected for passive evolution ; @xcite ) , using spectral energy distributions produced by the gissel96 stellar population synthesis code @xcite , assuming that the galaxies are 10 gyrs old and formed in an instantaneous burst , and have evolved passively since @xmath34 .",
    "the correction is only @xmath35 mag for our most distant galaxy ( 2masx j10172568 - 1041206 at @xmath36 ) and the assumptions of age and redshift of formation have negligible effect on the correction value .",
    "the magnitudes were also corrected for galactic absorption using the maps of @xcite , these corrections are @xmath37 mag .",
    "we take cluster x - ray luminosities from the _ rosat_-eso flux - limited x - ray galaxy cluster catalogue ( reflex ; @xcite ) .",
    "these are calculated from the _ rosat _ [ 0.1 - 2.4 kev ] band and extrapolated to 12 times the core radius of the cluster .",
    "our group x - ray luminosities are taken from the gems group catalogue @xcite .",
    "these luminosities are bolometric and extrapolated to the radius corresponding to an overdensity of 500 times the critical density ",
    "there is one object in common between the two samples : the ngc 5044 group .",
    "this group has log @xmath39 ( ergs@xmath3 ) and log @xmath40 ( ergs@xmath3 ) .",
    "reflex do not provide errors on their x - ray luminosities .",
    "therefore , we assume that the two catalogues are consistent within errors of @xmath41log(@xmath42 dex ."
