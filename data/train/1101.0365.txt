    "cosmology tells us that about 25% of the total mass density in the universe is dark matter that can not be accounted for by conventional baryons @xcite . alongside observation ,",
    "intense theoretical efforts are made in order to elucidate the nature and properties of this unknown form of matter . in this context ,",
    "electrically neutral and colorless weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) form an attractive scenario .",
    "their broad properties are : masses in the range of one to a few hundred gev , coupling constants in the milli - weak scale and lifetimes longer than the age of the universe .",
    "recent data from the direct - detection experiments dama / libra @xcite and cogent cogent , and the recent analysis of the data from the fermi gamma ray space telescope @xcite , if interpreted as signal for dark matter , require light wimps in the range of 5 to 10 gev @xcite .",
    "also , galactic substructure requires still lighter dark matter masses @xcite . in this regard , it is useful to note in passing that the xenon100 collaboration has provided serious constraints on the region of interest to dama / libra and cogent @xcite , assuming a constant extrapolation of the liquid xenon scintillation response for nuclear recoils below 5 kev , a claim disputed in @xcite . most recently , the cdms collaboration has released the analysis of their low - energy threshold data @xcite which seems to exclude the parameter space for dark matter interpretation of dama / libra and cogent results , assuming a standard halo dark matter model with an escape velocity @xmath1 km / s and neglecting the effect of ion channeling @xcite .",
    "however , with a highly anisotropic velocity distribution , it may be possible to reconcile the cogent and dama / libra results with the current exclusion limits from cdms and xenon @xcite ( see also comments on p.6 in @xcite about the possibility of shifting the exclusion contour in @xcite above the cogent signal region ) .",
    "in addition , cresst , another direct detection experiment at gran sasso , which uses cawo@xmath2 as target material , reported in talks at the idm 2010 and wonder 2010 workshops an excess of events in their oxygen band instead of tungsten band .",
    "if this signal is not due to neutron background a possible interpretation could be the elastic scattering of a light wimp depositing a detectable recoil energy on the the lightest nuclei ( oxygen ) in the detector @xcite .",
    "while this result has to await confirmation from the cresst collaboration , it is clear that it is important as well as interesting to study light dark matter .",
    "the most popular candidate for dark matter is the neutralino , a neutral @xmath3-odd supersymmetric particle .",
    "indeed , they are only produced or destroyed in pairs , thus rendering the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) stable @xcite . in the minimal version of the supersymmetric extension of the standard model ,",
    "the neutralino is a linear combination of the fermionic partners of the neutral electroweak gauge bosons ( gauginos ) and the neutral higgs bosons ( higgsinos ) .",
    "they can annihilate through a t - channel sfermion exchange into standard model fermions , or via a t - channel chargino - mediated process into @xmath4 , or through an s - channel pseudoscalar higgs exchange into fermion pairs and they can undergo elastic scattering with nuclei mainly through scalar higgs exchange @xcite .",
    "if these neutralinos were light , they would then be overproduced in the early universe and , in the minimal model , would not have an elastic - scattering cross section large enough to account for the dama / libra and cogent results due to constraints from other experiments such as the lep , tevatron , and rare decays @xcite .",
    "therefore , with no clear clue yet as to what the internal structure of these wimps is , if any , a pedestrian approach can be attractive . in this logic ,",
    "the simplest of models is to extend the standard model by adding a real scalar field , the dark matter , a standard - model gauge singlet that interacts with visible particles via the higgs field only . to ensure stability ,",
    "it is endowed with a discrete @xmath0 symmetry that does not spontaneously break .",
    "such a model can be seen as a low - energy remnant of some higher - energy physics waiting to be understood . in this cosmological",
    "setting , such an extension has first been proposed in @xcite and further studied in @xcite where the unbroken @xmath0 symmetry is extended to a global u(1 ) symmetry .",
    "a more extensive exploration of the model and its implications was done in burgess - pospelov - veldhuis , specific implications on higgs detection and lhc physics discussed in @xcite and one - loop vacuum stability looked into and perturbativity bounds obtained in @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite considers also this minimal extension and uses constraints from the experiments xenon10 @xcite and cdmsii @xcite to exclude dark matter masses smaller than 50 , 70 and 75gev for higgs masses equal to 120 , 200 and 350 gev respectively .    in order to allow for light dark matter , it is therefore necessary to go beyond the minimal one - real - scalar extension of the standard model .",
    "the natural next step is to add another real scalar field , endowed with a @xmath0 symmetry too , but one which is spontaneously broken so that new channels for dark matter annihilation are opened , increasing this way the annihilation cross - section , hence allowing smaller masses .",
    "this auxiliary field must also be a standard model gauge singlet .",
    "after this brief introductory motivation , we present the model in the next section .",
    "we perform the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and the additional @xmath0 symmetries in the usual way .",
    "we clarify the physical modes as well as the physical parameters .",
    "there is mixing between the physical new scalar field and the higgs , and this is one of the quantities parametrizing the subsequent physics . in section three",
    ", we impose the constraint from the known dark matter relic density on the dark - matter annihilation cross section and study its effects . of course , as we will see",
    ", the parameter space is quite large , and so , it is not realistic to hope to cover all of it in one single work of acceptable size .",
    "representative values have to be selected and the behavior of the model as well as its capabilities are described .",
    "our main focus in this study is the mass range 0.1gev  100gev and we find that the model is rich enough to bear dark matter in most of it , including the very light sector . in section four ,",
    "we determine the total cross section @xmath5 for non relativistic elastic scattering of dark matter off a nucleon target and compare it to the current direct - detection experimental bounds and projected sensitivity .",
    "for this , we choose the results of cdmsii and xenon100 , and the projections of supercdms @xcite and xenon1 t @xcite . here",
    "too we can not cover all of the parameter space nor are we going to give a detailed account of the behavior of @xmath5 as a function of the dark matter mass , but general patterns are mentioned .",
    "the last section is devoted to some concluding remarks .",
    "note that as a rule , we have avoided in this first study narrowing the choice of parameters using particle phenomenology .",
    "of course , such phenomenological constraints have to be addressed ultimately and this is left to a forthcoming investigation , contenting ourselves in the present work with a limited set of remarks mentioned in this last section .",
    "finally , we have gathered in an appendix the partial results regarding the calculation of the dark matter annihilation cross section .",
    "we extend the standard model by adding two real , spinless and @xmath6-symmetric fields : the dark matter field @xmath7 for which the @xmath0 symmetry is unbroken and an auxiliary field @xmath8 for which it is spontaneously broken .",
    "both fields are standard model gauge singlets and hence can interact with ` visible ' particles only via the higgs doublet @xmath9 .",
    "this latter is taken in the unitary gauge such that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a real scalar .",
    "we assume all processes calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "the potential function that includes @xmath7 , @xmath11 and @xmath8 writes as follows:@xmath12where @xmath13 , @xmath14and @xmath15 and all the coupling constants are real positive numbers . in the standard model scenario , electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs for the higgs field , which then oscillates around the vacuum expectation value @xmath16 particle - data - group .",
    "the field @xmath8 will oscillate around the vacuum expectation value @xmath17 . both @xmath18 and @xmath19",

    "perturbativity is assumed , hence all these original coupling constants are small .",
    "the dark - matter self - coupling constant @xmath55 does not enter in the calculations of the lowest - order processes of this work @xcite , so effectively , we are left with eight parameters .",

    "the value in ( [ v12sigma_annihi ] ) for the dark matter annihilation cross - section translates into a relation between the parameters of a given theory entering the calculated expression of @xmath73 , hence imposing a constraint on these parameters which will limit the intervals of possible dark matter masses .",

    "for example , in our model , we can obtain via ( v12sigma_annihi ) the mutual coupling constant @xmath78 for given values of @xmath64 , study its behavior as a function of @xmath58 and tell which dark - matter mass regions are consistent with perturbativity .",

    "we can not describe every bit of it . also , one has to note from the outset that for a given set of values for the parameters , the solution to the relic - density constraint is not unique : besides positive real solutions ( when they exist ) , we may find negative real or even complex solutions .",

    "<S> we extend the standard model by adding two gauge - singlet @xmath0-symmetric scalar fields that interact with visible matter only through the higgs particle . </S>",
    "<S> one is a stable dark matter wimp , and the other one undergoes a spontaneous breaking of the symmetry that opens new channels for the dark matter annihilation , hence lowering the mass of the wimp . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effects of the observed dark matter relic abundance on the annihilation cross section and find that in most regions of the parameters space , light dark matter is viable . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the elastic scattering cross - section of our dark matter candidate off nucleus with existing ( cdmsii and xenon100 ) and projected ( supercdms and xenon1 t ) experimental exclusion bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the allowed mass range for light dark matter will be probed by the projected sensitivity of xenon1 t experiment . </S>"
