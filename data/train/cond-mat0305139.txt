    "the problem of the behavior of a real quantum system is complicated in many cases by the fact that it is coupled to the environment degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the adequate description of the non - equilibrium time - dependent properties of quantum systems in contact with a thermal reservoir and in external time - dependent fields is an interesting and important problem of modern theoretical physics . in particular , this description is necessary for studying stochastic processes in mathematical physics @xcite and for studying the effective potentials at finite temperatures in particle physics @xcite . in condensed matter physics examples of this type of problems",
    "are two - state systems coupled to a dissipative environment @xcite , spin systems in a heat bath environment @xcite , superconductors in contact with a heat bath @xcite and many others .",
    "the standard method for studying quantum systems out of equilibrium is the closed - time - path green function formalism @xcite . for spin systems in general , this method ca nt be applied directly , since the commutators of arbitrary spin operators @xmath1 are not @xmath2-numbers , and for this case a standard wick theorem does not exist @xcite . however , for the particular case of @xmath3 , when the operators anti - commute , the corresponding path integral technique has been developed @xcite .",
    "this technique is based essentially on standard field theory methods with the introduction of majorana fermions . in this paper",
    "we study the non - equilibrium properties of the @xmath4 ferromagnetic heisenberg model in contact with a phonon heat bath by means of this method ( the heisenberg model in equilibrium was studied with this technique in @xcite , for example ) .",
    "there are several reasons for studying spin systems out of equilibrium .",
    "for example , recently discovered big magnetic molecules @xcite show relaxation times which are extremely large ( see also @xcite , where the experimental results for the case of external magnetic field are described ) .",
    "theoretical studies of this phenomenon were performed in @xcite , but more quantitative analysis is still lacking .    the behavior of a spin system in the presence of an external magnetic field flip @xmath5 is also an interesting problem .",
    "in particular , the question whether there exists a critical value of the magnetic field below which the system does not relax to equilibrium and is in a quasi - periodic regime , as it takes place in the case of a @xmath0-theory @xcite , is interesting .    in this paper the questions mentioned above",
    "are studied in the case of the heisenberg model coupled to a phonon heat bath and in an external time - dependent magnetic field .",
    "we consider the interacting spin system in a magnetic field on the mean field level , and the phonon heat bath is studied as a perturbation up to the second order in the spin - phonon coupling .",
    "we introduce the formalism specific to the spin problem and apply it to several examples of a single spin in a magnetic field and then take the leading approximation to study interacting spins .",
    "the heisenberg hamiltonian with a spin - phonon coupling in an external magnetic field can be written as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the nearest neighbor ferromagnetic coupling , @xmath8 are site coordinates , @xmath9 is a bath mode with coordinate @xmath10 , momentum @xmath11 and frequency @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the spin - phonon coupling .",

    "therefore , in practice , the @xmath45-integration in ( [ k ] ) can be performed using the discrete path integral approximation , with the time contour divided on a finite number @xmath66 of time intervals @xcite and eq.([k ] ) written as : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are diagonal @xmath71 zero- and unit - matrices , respectively .",

    "as a first example we consider the problem of the behavior of the magnetization of one spin in the presence of the homogeneous time dependent magnetic field @xmath96 . we will consider the effect of performing spin rotations by @xmath97 or @xmath98 .",
    "let us consider first the case of magnetic field flipping .",
    "it is supposed that the system is in equilibrium at initial time @xmath99 at temperature @xmath100 and at @xmath101 the magnetic field suddenly changes its direction : @xmath102 .",
    "also at this time the coupling to the phonons at temperature @xmath103 is switched on , otherwise the relaxation to equilibrium will not take place .",
    "the heat bath is necessary to get magnetization relaxation to equilibrium with the magnetic field @xmath104 .",
    "otherwise , the magnetization will precess around the old field @xmath62 , as it follows from the equation for magnetization in the case of no spin - phonon coupling : @xmath105    let us get the equation for @xmath106 when there is spin - phonon coupling .",
    "since the magnetic field is homogeneous in space , the field @xmath106 and the magnetization @xmath107 do not depend on site @xmath108 , and the mean - field equation ( [ phi ] ) can be written as @xmath109 this last equation is equivalent to @xmath110 where @xmath111    this is a simple renormalization of the magnetic field induced by the heath bath and does not depend on the heat bath temperature @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , a higher correction beyond the saddle - point level must be considered .",
    "we shall study the behavior of the magnetization @xmath91 of one spin calculated by expressions ( [ m1detail ] ) and ( [ b ] ) .",
    "for one spin there are no site indices in these expressions and the formula for the magnetization can be simplified .",
    "let us limit our consideration to the linear term in @xmath112 , which assumes that the heat bath coupling is weak .",
    "then , the expression for the @xmath113-component of the magnetization has the following form : @xmath114 .",
    "\\label{m1spin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since we are interested in the correction to the magnetization linear in @xmath112 , the green s function @xmath115 in equation ( [ m1spin ] ) can be calculated at @xmath116 .",
    "when the magnetic field flipping is applied , the expressions for free green s functions ( [ g > ] ) and ( [ g < ] ) remain correct with the only substitution @xmath117 in the complex exponents .",
    "the fermi - factors in these expressions do not change with the magnetic field flipping , since they are defined by the initial conditions , but the time exponentials , which define the dynamics of the spins , are changed accordingly .",
    "the overall expression does not get modified because both fields are along the same direction .",
    "assuming , for simplicity , that only the @xmath118-component of the spin is coupled to the heat bath ( @xmath119 ) , substituting ( [ g ] ) , ( [ g > ] ) and ( [ g < ] ) in ( [ m1spin ] ) and integrating over @xmath120 and @xmath121 leads to the following expression for the @xmath113-component of the magnetization .",

    "obviously , expression ( [ mspinsol ] ) is correct for small times @xmath125 , when the perturbation theory is valid , which is the regime where the magnetic field flipping is important .",
    "the time dependence of the magnetization for different types of the phonon heat bath is presented in fig.2 .",
    "as it follows from this figure the phonon density of states plays an important role in the spin dynamics .",
    "the behavior of the magnetization after lowering the temperature for the cases of magnetic field flipping and constant magnetic field is presented in fig.3 for comparison",
    ". the magnetization decreases as @xmath126 at short times in both cases and is a linear function of @xmath127 , when @xmath128 ( see ( [ mspinsol ] ) and asymptotic expression ( [ delta ] ) for long times ) .",
    "let us now consider a qualitative scheme of how to obtain from expression ( [ mspinsol ] ) the relaxation of the magnetization to the equilibrium value at @xmath129 . in the case",
    "when @xmath130 the following relation can be used @xmath131 then , equation ( [ mspinsol ] ) can be transformed to @xmath132 where @xmath133 and the equilibrium value of the magnetization at @xmath134 is @xmath135    in the case when @xmath136 is not too large , but much bigger than @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and taking @xmath139 as arbitrary , equation ( [ int1 ] ) can be transformed into the differential equation @xmath140 with the initial boundary condition @xmath141 the solution of ( [ int2 ] ) , ( [ bc ] ) is @xmath142 as it follows from equation ( [ m1sollongt ] ) , the magnetization approaches its equilibrium value exponentially , and the relaxation time @xmath143 is defined by the final temperature , magnetic field , and by the heat bath parameters .",
    "as another example let us now consider the time - dependence of the magnetization under the effect of a @xmath144-rotation of the magnetic field : @xmath145 .",
    "the dependence calculated by means of expression ( [ m1spin ] ) in the case of the lowest order spin @xmath118-component - phonon coupling is presented in fig.4 .",
    "the magnetization is precessing and its direction is changing towards the new direction of the magnetic field in the case of non - zero spin - phonon coupling .",
    "in the case of many spins the time relaxation dynamics is complicated by the spin - spin interaction .",
    "let us simplify the problem by taking into account the spin - spin interaction at the mean - field level .",
    "the spin hamiltonian in the case of the magnetic field in @xmath113-direction can be written as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is dimensionality of the system and the initial magnetization @xmath148 is defined by the equation @xmath149 therefore , the problem is reduced to one spin in the effective field @xmath150 .",
    "the formula ( [ mspinsol ] ) with the substitution @xmath151 describes the time - dependence of the magnetization of the heisenberg model after the magnetic field flipping .",
    "the time - dependence of the magnetization for the spin system at different values of @xmath152 is presented in fig.5 .",
    "as it follows from this figure , the time - dependence of the magnetization strongly depends on the relation @xmath153 keeping the other parameters fixed .",
    "let us analyse the expression ( [ mspinsol ] ) at quite long times , when the relation ( [ delta ] ) can be applied .",
    "either the first or the second terms in the curled brackets contribute to the integral in ( [ mspinsol ] ) , when the sign of @xmath154 is negative or positive , respectively .",
    "this leads to different , negative or positive , corrections to the magnetization due to the magnetic field flipping .",
    "therefore , the equation @xmath155 defines the critical magnetic field value @xmath156 , below which the magnetic field flipping does not lead to a change of the magnetization sign .",
    "equation @xmath155 together with ( [ mmf ] ) gives the expression , which connects @xmath156 with @xmath157 and @xmath100 : @xmath158 the initial temperature dependence of @xmath156 is presented in fig.6 .",
    "as it follows from this figure , at low temperatures , the critical value of magnetic field is @xmath152 , i.e. it is of order of the ferromagnetic coupling energy , which should be overcome to change the sign of the magnetization of the system .",
    "the time - dependence of the magnetization for the spin system at different values of @xmath159 is presented in fig.7 .",
    "as it follows from this figure , the magnetization does not flip when the magnetic field is lower than the critical value @xmath160 at given temperature @xmath161 ( see fig.6 ) . in this case",
    "the magnetization oscillates with a reasonably large amplitude , similarly to the case of the @xmath0-theory @xcite and does not relax to the overturned magnetization . in the @xmath0-theory",
    "a vector self - interacting theory is considered . in our case",
    "the interaction part is due to the spin interactions .",
    "finally , in fig.8 we present the normalized magnetization deviation @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "the rate of change of the magnetization corresponds to the fermi golden rule for the scattering cross section .",
    "after an initial rapid increase the rate converges to a constant valid for intermediate times , as well known .",
    "for very large times the perturbation theory is no longer valid . in this regime",
    "we have to consider higher order corrections which complicates the solution .",
    "this will be considered in a future publication .",
    "the problem of the time - dependence of the magnetization of a spin system in a time - dependent magnetic field is interesting both from the point of view of its practical applications , and from the theoretical point of view . in this paper",
    "we have studied the behavior of the heisenberg ferromagnet coupled to a heat bath in a time dependent external magnetic field . in particular , we considered the case when its direction is suddenly changed . as expected",
    "the behavior of the system strongly depends on the phonon bath properties .",
    "it has also been shown that there is a critical value of the magnetic field below which the magnetization does not relax to the equilibrium value after the magnetic field flipping .",
    "this situation is analogous to the @xmath0-theory case , where also exists a critical value of the external source @xcite .    in this work",
    "we considered a microscopic description for the vector spin system directly instead of using an effective bosonic theory from the start .",
    "representing the spin operators by majorana fermions we constructed the path integral representation for the spin system . also , we used a physical way to introduce the relaxation to equilibrium coupling the system to a heat bath .",
    "for simplicity we used a phonon heat bath .",
    "the spin - phonon coupling can be integrated exactly introducing an effective time - dependent interaction between the spins .",
    "afterwards we bosonized the model via a hubbard - stratonovich transformation leading to an effective bosonic theory ( after integrating out the majorana fermions ) which has some resemblances with the @xmath0-theory but with significant differences like time - dependent coefficients and the introduction of cubic terms ( like @xmath163 ) due to the presence of a three field vertex which originates in the three - spin correlation function which does not vanish in general due to the nature of the spin commutation relations .",
    "at the same time there are several questions which remain open like the interpolation between the short time and the long time behaviors .",
    "also , in the problem of quantum spinodal decomposition , the possibility of the formation of a magnetic bubble of the stable phase immersed in a background of the unstable phase and the determination of its radius time - dependence is an interesting open problem . these and some other questions are planned to be studied in the nearest future where a detailed comparison of the heisenberg model with the @xmath0-theory will be carried out .",
