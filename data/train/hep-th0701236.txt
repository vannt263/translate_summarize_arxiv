    "counting problems in supersymmetric gauge theories reveal a rich structure of the chiral ring , its generators and their relations . using the generating functions for counting bps operators in the chiral ring , one can get further information about the dimension of the moduli space of vacua and the effective number of degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "the computation of such generating functions is generically a very hard problem and to date there is no clear way which demonstrates how to analyze such a problem .",
    "there are , however , special cases in which the problem simplifies considerably and one can get an exact answer for the generating function .",
    "there is an amazing simplification of the problem of counting bps operators in the chiral ring when the gauge theory is living on @xmath7 d brane in type ii superstring theory @xcite .",
    "for such a case one is applying the plethystic program which is introduced in @xcite and discussed in further detail in @xcite . the main point in this program",
    "is the use of the plethystic exponential and its inverse , the plethystic logarithm , in a way which allows the computation of finite @xmath7 generating functions in terms of only one quantity ",
    "the generating function for a single d brane .",
    "the generating function for one d brane is calculated in turn by using geometric properties of the moduli space of vacua for this gauge theory , typically the moduli space being a calabi - yau ( cy ) manifold . in many cases the generating function for one d brane is computed even without the detailed knowledge of the quiver gauge theory and bypasses this data by just using the geometric properties of the moduli space .",
    "the plethystic program brings about an important distinction between different types of moduli spaces  we have three such types : 1 .",
    "there are moduli spaces which are freely generated  that is the set of generators obey no relations .",
    "2 . there are moduli spaces which are complete intersections  that is there are generators that satisfy relations such that the number of relations plus the dimension of the moduli space is equal to the number of generators .",
    "3 . the rest are moduli spaces which are not complete intersections .",
    "the last class of models is by far the largest class .",
    "most moduli spaces of vacua do not admit a simple algebraic description which truncates at some level .",
    "it is important , however , to single out and specify the moduli spaces which fall into the first two classes as they are substantially simpler to describe and to analyze .",
    "counting problems in supersymmetric gauge theories have been a subject of recent and not so recent interest .",
    "the first paper possibly dates back to 1998 , @xcite and is independently reproduced in @xcite .",
    "other works include @xcite , this subject is of increased interest in recent times .",
    "mesonic generating functions were given in @xcite , mixed branches were covered using `` surgery '' methods @xcite and baryonic generating functions for divisors in toric geometry were computed in @xcite .",
    "the combination of these problems brings about the next interesting problem  that of counting baryonic operators on the moduli space .",
    "baryons have been considered in detail in supersymmetric gauge theories and were subject of intensive study in the context of the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . of particular mention",
    "are the works by @xcite were baryons were discussed in detail from a gauge theory point of view ; @xcite with the relation of giant gravitons to holomorphic curves in the geometry ; and @xcite with the quantization of the system , leading to the right way to treat counting of baryons in quiver gauge theories .",
    "in this paper we progress one step further by computing generating functions for baryonic bps operators .",
    "the crucial methods which are used are the successful combination of the plethystic program @xcite together with the baryonic generating functions for divisors in the geometry @xcite .",
    "together they form an exact result that computes bps operators on baryonic branches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ generalcy ]",
    "we introduce the plethystic program for baryonic generating functions for theories with one baryonic charge . in section [ conifold ]",
    "we look in detail on baryonic generating functions for the conifold theory .",
    "we start by describing the case for @xmath8 d brane and discuss in detail the generating function for unfixed and for fixed baryonic charges .",
    "the analysis leads to an interesting interplay with chebyshev polynomials and we spell out this correspondence .",
    "the relation to the geometry is elaborated and diagrammatic rules are composed for computing generating functions for @xmath8 d brane and fixed baryonic charge .",
    "the relation to tilings of the two dimensional plane is discussed and the lattice of bps charges reveals itself beautifully as the ( p , q ) web of the toric diagram .",
    "we then proceed to discuss the general @xmath7 case and write the relations between the different generating functions , for fixed and unfixed d brane charge and for fixed and unfixed baryonic charges .",
    "the case of @xmath9 and small number of branes is computed and discussed in detail .",
    "aspects of the plethystic exponential and the plethystic logarithm are then discussed in detail and lead to the understanding of the generators and relations for the chiral ring .",
    "we then turn to a toy model , termed `` half the conifold '' and demonstrate how the plethystic program for baryons computes the generating function exactly , leading to a freely generated moduli space for fixed number of branes , @xmath7 . a comparison with the molien invariant is then pursued .",
    "another example called `` @xmath10 the conifold '' is discussed in detail . in section [ secc2z2 ]",
    "we compute the generating functions for the orbifold @xmath11 and finally we conclude .",
    "in this section we will give general prescriptions on the computation of generating functions for bps operators in the chiral ring of a supersymmetric gauge theory that lives on a d brane which probes a generic non - compact cy manifold which has a single baryonic charge .",
    "a class of such manifolds includes the @xmath12 theories @xcite , or more generally it includes the @xmath13 theories @xcite .",
    "a challenge problem which remained elusive up to now was to compute the generating functions for baryonic operators .",
    "this paper will be devoted to the study of this problem , with success for a selected set of theories .",
    "the problem of computing generating functions for a general cy manifold is still very difficult to solve but with the methods of this section we will be able to reduce the problem of computing the generating function for a generic number of d branes , @xmath7 and generic baryonic number @xmath14 , to a much simpler problem .",
    "this reduction is done using the plethystic program @xcite ( see further details in @xcite ) .",
    "recall that in the case of baryon number @xmath15 , namely for mesonic generating functions @xcite , the knowledge of the generating function for @xmath8 is enough to compute the generating function for any @xmath7 .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the operators for finite @xmath7 are symmetric functions of the operators for @xmath8 and this is precisely the role which is played by the plethystic exponential  to take a generating function for a set of operators and count all possible symmetric functions of it .    for the present case , in which the baryon number is non - zero , it turns out that the procedure is not too different than the mesonic case",
    ". one needs to have the knowledge of a single generating function , @xmath16 , for one d brane , @xmath8 and for a fixed baryon number @xmath14 , and this information is enough to generate all generating functions for any number of d branes and for a fixed baryonic number @xcite .    given a @xmath17 supersymmetric gauge theory with a collection of @xmath18 global symmetries , @xmath19",
    ", we will have a set of @xmath20 chemical potentials @xmath21 .",
    "the generating function for a gauge theory living on a d brane probing a generic non - compact cy manifold is going to depend on the set of parameters , @xmath22 .",
    "there is always at least one such @xmath18 global symmetry and one such chemical potential @xmath23 , corresponding to the @xmath24 symmetry . for a given cy manifold",
    "we will denote the generating function for a fixed number of d branes , @xmath7 and a fixed baryonic charge @xmath25 by @xmath26    let us introduce a chemical potential @xmath27 for the number of d branes .",
    "then the generating function for any number of d branes and for a fixed baryonic charge @xmath14 is given by    @xmath28 \\equiv \\exp\\biggl(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\nu^k}{k}g_{1,b}(\\{t_i^k\\ } ; cy ) \\biggr)\\\\ & = & \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\nu^n g_{n , n b}(\\{t_i\\ } ; cy ) . \\label{g1plet}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this formula can be inverted to give the generating function for fixed baryonic charge and fixed number of branes , in case the generating function for fixed baryonic charge is known ,    @xmath29    we can further introduce a chemical potential @xmath30 for the baryon number and sum over all possible baryon numbers go get the generating function for an unfixed baryonic number ,    @xmath31    this formula is very schematic , however sufficient to the purposes of this paper .",
    "the correct general formula would accommodate multiple baryonic charges , not necessarily running over all integers , and multiplicities for the components @xmath32 . from the previous formula we can extract the generating function for",
    "a fixed number of d branes @xmath7 ,    @xmath33    this set of equations form the basis of this paper and allow for the computation of @xmath34 for any @xmath7 and @xmath14 , once @xmath35 is known . as a result , the problem of computing generating functions for baryonic operators greatly simplifies and amounts to figuring out the much simpler case of one d brane , @xmath35 .",
    "the generating function @xmath16 can be given a geometric interpretation .",
    "as @xmath36 is the character for holomorphic functions on the cy manifold @xcite , @xmath16 is the character for holomorphic sections of suitable line bundles @xcite .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that we can use holomorphic surfaces to parameterize supersymmetric configurations of d3 branes wrapped on non trivial cycles on the cy horizon @xcite . in this construction",
    "the baryonic charge in gauge theory is related to the homology of the cycles in geometry and @xmath16 gets contribution from surfaces ( zero loci of sections ) belonging to a given homology class .",
    "formula ( [ g1plet ] ) can be alternatively interpreted as giving the bps hilbert space of states with baryonic charge @xmath14 and number of branes @xmath7 as the geometric quantization of the classical configuration space of supersymmetric d3 branes wrapped on cycles of homology @xmath14 .",
    "the explicit construction and methods for computing @xmath16 have been given in @xcite .    to demonstrate this method of computation we will now turn to few simple examples in which one can compute the generating functions and perform some consistency checks of this proposal .",
    "the gauge theory on the conifold has a global symmetry @xmath37 .",
    "it has 4 basic fields @xmath38 and @xmath39 that transform under these symmetries according to the following table :    .global charges for the basic fields of the quiver gauge theory on the d brane probing the conifold . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ globalc2z2 ]    note that both @xmath24 and @xmath40 are r symmetries but @xmath40 is anomalous while @xmath24 is anomaly free .",
    "the mesonic generating function on the higgs branch was computed in @xcite and takes the form    @xmath41    the generating function on the mixed coulomb and higgs branch was computed in @xcite .",
    "both these works do not count baryonic operators .",
    "in particular there is no counting for gauge invariant operators in which the number of @xmath42 s is different than the number of @xmath14 s . for simplicity we will not count operators with adjoint fields and therefore mostly going to ignore the @xmath43 factor in the following expressions .",
    "we will now proceed to compute the baryonic generating function . as before we start by analysis of the @xmath8 case .",
    "the case @xmath8 for the orbifold is slightly different from that for the conifold .",
    "the reason is that , even for @xmath8 , the superpotential does not vanish .",
    "in particular there is a non trivial f term relation @xmath44 .",
    "there are 3 global charges for this case and 4 fields with one relation .",
    "this leads to expectation that the @xmath8 generating function is a complete intersection .",
    "we can also write an expression which will take care of the @xmath43 factor ,    @xmath45    and write the generating function of the @xmath11 part as generated by four fields subject to one relation ,    @xmath46    this generating function describes a moduli space which is a 3 dimensional complete intersection , generated by the chiral multiplets @xmath47 , which satisfy one relation @xmath48 .",
    "following the same procedure as in section [ conifold ] for the conifold theory we find    @xmath49    these generating functions can be described diagrammatically by the toric diagram of the @xmath50 space , as depicted in figure [ diagramz2toric ] .",
    "can be computed using the index theorem and written as sum over fixed points corresponding to the @xmath51 web vertices of @xmath50 .",
    "as in the conifold case , localization needs to be performed in a correctly normalized basis of charges for @xmath52 , which are related to @xmath53 by equation ( [ rel ] ) .",
    "the vertical legs contribute the factorized factor @xmath54 in equation ( [ tota ] ) . ]    by comparing equation ( [ g1c2z2 ] ) with equation ( [ chebymesonid ] ) we find that @xmath35 admits a chebyshev polynomial expansion , with the assignments @xmath55 ,    @xmath56    this is a surprising point and suggests that the baryonic charge is a @xmath18 cartan subgroup of a hidden global @xmath57 symmetry .",
    "this symmetry can not be present in the classical theory since it acts differently on the @xmath42 s and @xmath14 s which in turn do not carry the same gauge quantum numbers .",
    "we will come back to this point for higher number of d branes .",
    "we make a digression to explore the relation of the @xmath8 generating function of bps gauge invariant operators with the natural geometric counterpart , the generating function for homogeneous polynomials .",
    "we saw that , in the case of the conifold , the two generating functions coincide . in this respect ,",
    "the conifold is unique since there is a one - to - one correspondence between homogeneous coordinates and elementary fields . for a generic toric cone , although , modulo seiberg s dualities , the quiver is completely determined by the toric data , the relation between homogeneous coordinates and fields is more involved . the toric diagram for @xmath50 is shown in figure [ c2z2 ]",
    ". there are four homogeneous coordinates associated with the four integer points on the perimeter of the toric diagram .",
    "we choose the following relation between the homogeneous charges and the baryonic and flavor charges @xmath58 where @xmath30 denotes as before the baryonic charge .",
    "the assignment of baryonic charge is compatible with the general formula ( [ bartoric ] ) .",
    "it is a simple exercise in tiling construction to assign homogeneous charges to the elementary fields @xcite .",
    "the fields @xmath59 with baryonic charge one are associated with @xmath60 .",
    "the fields @xmath61 with baryonic charge minus one are associated instead with @xmath62 and @xmath63 . in terms of global charges ,",
    "@xmath30 counts the baryonic charge , @xmath64 counts the @xmath65 numbers and @xmath23 the dimension .",
    "notice that the coordinate @xmath66 , with baryonic charge @xmath67 is not associated with an elementary field .",
    "the generating function for homogeneous polynomials is @xmath68 the factor @xmath69 is factorized and will be ignored in the following .",
    "the functions @xmath70 enumerate homogeneous monomials with baryonic charge @xmath14 and we could expect that @xmath70 coincides with the previously computed @xmath71 .",
    "this is actually true for @xmath72 , as can be explicitly checked by expanding the generating function in laurent series , but fails for @xmath73 .",
    "the reason is that geometry at baryonic number @xmath74 counts all homogeneous monomials with @xmath74 starting with @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath66 is not associated with a field , these geometrical objects have no direct relation with field theory .",
    "we see that the expansion of the geometric generating function contains all the basic ingredients @xmath16 which serve for the construction of the quantum field theory partition functions but packed together in a different way .",
    "the field theory generating function can be reconstructed from the geometric one by using the following observations : the positive baryonic charge partition functions @xmath70 give the correct result , computing bps operators with more @xmath42 s than @xmath14 s , and moreover the orbifold has an obvious @xmath75 symmetry between @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "so for @xmath8 the natural expectation for the field theory generating function is @xmath76 which indeed coincides with equation  ( [ g1c2z2 ] ) .",
    "using methods by now familiar we compute    @xmath78 }     { \\left(1-t_1 ^ 2\\right )     \\left(1-t_2 ^ 2\\right ) ( 1-t_1 ^ 2 x^2)(1- \\frac{t_1 ^ 2 } { x^2 } ) ( 1- t_1 t_2 x^2)(1- \\frac { t_1 t_2 } { x^2 } )    ( 1-t_2 ^ 2 x^2)(1- \\frac{t_2 ^ 2 } { x^2 } ) } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on the @xmath79 lattice the first few terms look like    @xmath80    taking the plethystic logarithm of equation ( [ g2c2z2 ] ) we find    @xmath81    implying that there are nine generators , quadratic in the basic fields of table [ globalc2z2 ] transforming in the spin ( 1,1 ) representation of @xmath82 .",
    "they satisfy 6 relations , quartic in the basic fields and hence quadratic in the generators , that transform as spin ( 1,0 ) + ( 0,1 ) of the global symmetry .",
    "explicitly , the generators are the following objects , conveniently arranged into a @xmath83 matrix :    @xmath84    note that @xmath48 by the f term relations and therefore only one of them needs to be counted .",
    "there are two relations among the operators @xmath85 and @xmath86 and four among @xmath87 .",
    "one can analogously compute the @xmath88 generating function .",
    "the expression is too long to present here but we can show the first few terms in the @xmath79 lattice ,    @xmath89    there are 16 generators , four @xmath90 , three @xmath91 , five @xmath92 and four @xmath93 . they transform as spin @xmath94 , 1 , 2 , and @xmath94 of @xmath95 , respectively .",
    "these generators are subject to 6 relations at order six and twelve relations at order seven .",
    "due to the non trivial f terms , there are no non factorizable baryons for @xmath88 . for higher values of @xmath7 ,",
    "the generators of the chiral ring include the basic determinants @xmath96 and @xmath97 , mesonic operators @xmath98 for @xmath99 and non factorizable baryons .",
    "the latter appears for the first time at @xmath100 ; there are @xmath101 baryons of the form @xmath102 as well as more complicated determinants that appear for higher values of @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we use two basic principles to construct the exact generating function which counts baryonic and mesonic bps operators in the chiral ring of quiver gauge theories .",
    "explicit formulas are given for the conifold theory and some subsets of the fields in it ( these are termed  half the conifold \" and  @xmath10 the conifold \" , respectively ) , and for the orbifold @xmath11 .",
    "the first principle relies on the plethystic program which is presented in @xcite and discussed further in @xcite .",
    "the second principle is based on @xcite and describes how to handle baryonic generating functions with specific divisors in the geometry .",
    "this is translated into generating functions for fixed baryonic numbers and hence leads to the full generating function for any number of d branes , @xmath7 , and any baryonic charge , @xmath14 , as well as the other charges in the system such as @xmath103 charges and flavor charges .",
    "the results in the paper can be also interpreted as based on the semiclassical quantization of wrapped supersymmetric branes in an @xmath104 background dual to a strongly coupled gauged theory at large @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that such countings seem to be valid also for weak coupling constant and small values of @xmath7 , as similarly observed in the case of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "an important outcome of the study in this paper is the identification of the baryon number @xmath14 with the khler modulus .",
    "this identification repeats itself in both the conifold theory and in the orbifold @xmath11 and is expected to be true for any cy manifold .",
    "in fact the computation of generating functions reveals an important connection between gauge theories and their cy moduli spaces by providing the baryon number as the discrete area of two cycles .",
    "this is the quantum volume of the two cycle in a regime in which the string theory is strongly coupled and the gauge theory description reveals an underlying discrete structure .",
    "we expect this correspondence to produce a new line of research for strongly coupled string theories",
    ".    in this paper we considered in details the case of the conifold and the simplest orbifold @xmath106 and we did not include @xmath107 fermionic operators",
    ". it would be interesting to extend the analysis done in this paper to the case of an arbitrary toric calabi yau with arbitrary number of baryonic symmetries and to the case of fermionic operators .",
    "another interesting direction of research would be the study of the large charges behavior of the baryonic generating functions and the construction of @xmath107 entropy functions for quiver gauge theories .",
    "there are several other directions one can pursue in counting problems of supersymmetric gauge theories @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand if there exist a relation between the type of counting presented in this paper and other counting problems such as the computations of microscopic degrees of freedom of black holes entropy and instanton partition functions .",
    "we plan to study these problems in future publications .",
