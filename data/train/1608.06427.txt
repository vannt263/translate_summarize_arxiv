    "in this introduction , we first provide a colloquial account to the problem of regularizability .",
    "next , we outline our contribution .      consider a network of nodes and edges .",
    "the nodes represent the network actors and the edges are the connections between actors .",
    "another ingredient is the force of the connection between two connected actors .",
    "we can represent this force with a number , called the weight associated with each edge : the greater the weight , the stronger the relation between the actors linked by the edge . the _ strength _ of a node as the sum of the weights of the edges connecting the node to some neighbor .",
    "the strength of a node gives a rough estimate of how much important is the node .",
    "in real networks , the distribution of connections among actors is typically very asymmetric : a few actors have many connections and the most have few links .",
    "similarly , few actors generally collect a great part of total strength in the network .",
    "this disparity can be a harbinger of frictions and crisis between the actors of the network .",
    "consider , by way of example , figure [ fig : gasreal ] , which depicts ( a subset of ) the european natural gas pipeline network .",
    "nodes are european countries ( country codes according to iso 3166 - 1 ) and there is an undirected edge between two nations if there exists a natural gas pipeline that crosses the borders of the two countries .",
    "data has been downloaded from the website of the international energy agency ( www.iea.org ) .",
    "the original data corresponds to a directed , weighted multigraph , with edge weights corresponding to the maximum flow of the pipeline .",
    "we simplified and symmetrized the network , mapping the edge weights in a consistent way .",
    "the distribution of strength of the countries is very skewed , with germany leading the ranking with a strength value of 46.25 and luxembourg closing the ranking with a strength value of 0.44 ( two orders of magnitude less than germany ) .",
    "the _ regularization problem _ we approach in this work is the following : given a network with fixed nodes and edges , we look to an assignment of weight to each edge of the network such that all nodes have the same non - zero strength value .",
    "hence , we seek for a way to associate a level of force with the connections among actors so that the resulting network is found to be egalitarian , that is , all players have the same importance .",
    "such a network is supposed to be less prone to problematic frictions among its constituents .",
    "figure [ fig : gasreg ] shows a regularized version of the gas pipeline network : edge weights are such such each country has now the same strength .",
    "notice that regularized edge weights are generally quite different from the real ones depicted in figure [ fig : gasreal ] .",
    "the regularization problem sketched above is customarily defined on undirected graphs and constrained to nonnegative integer weights @xcite . in this paper , we build a _ regularization hierarchy _ of ( either directed and undirected ) graph classes : at the bottom of the hierarchy lies the set of graphs that are regularizable with arbitrary ( possibly negative ) weights . above this class",
    "there is the set of graphs that are regularizable with nonnegative weights , and above the set of graphs that are regularizable with positive weights . at the top of the hierarchy",
    "is the class of naturally regular graphs , that is , graphs whose nodes have already the same degree without any weighting .    we show that the regularization hierarchy is strict , meaning that each class is properly included in the lower one . since a graph can be represented with an adjacency matrix , each graph class in the regularization hierarchy has a counterpart matrix class .",
    "we investigate , for the classes of the hierarchy , structural conditions on both the graph and the corresponding adjacency matrix that are necessary and sufficient for the inclusion in the class .",
    "in particular for the bottom and largest class of our hierarchy we find a structural characterization of its members that can be translated in matrix language by means of the notion of chainable matrix @xcite . for graphs regularizable with nonnegative and positive weights",
    "the two characterizations involve the notions of spanning cycle forest for the graph and of support and total support for its adjacency matrix @xcite .",
    "we prove that , for all classes , if a regularization solution exists , then there exists also an integral solution .",
    "we study the computational complexity of the problem of positioning a graph in the hierarchy , and model the problem of finding the regularization weights as a linear programming feasibility problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ hierarchy ] we present the regularization hierarchy .",
    "in particular , in sections [ prg ] and [ nnrg ] we review and extend to directed graphs some known results on regularizability with nonnegative and positive weights . in section [ nrg ]",
    "we investigate negative regularizable graphs . in section [ inclusion ]",
    "we show that the inclusion relation among the graph classes is strict .",
    "section [ complexity ] is devoted to computational issues . in section [ related ]",
    "we present the related literature .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ conclusion ] .",

    "we denote with @xmath2 the graph whose adjacency matrix is @xmath0 , that is , @xmath2 has @xmath3 nodes numbered from @xmath4 to @xmath3 and it has an edge @xmath5 from node @xmath6 to node @xmath7 with weight @xmath8 if and only if @xmath9 . any square matrix @xmath0 corresponds to a weighted graph @xmath2 and any weighted graph @xmath10 , once its nodes have been ordered , corresponds to a matrix @xmath11 .",

    "matrix @xmath12 is a square matrix such that each row and each column of @xmath12 contains exactly one entry equal to @xmath4 and all other entries are equal to @xmath13 .",
    "the two graphs @xmath2 and @xmath14 are said to be isomorphic since they differ only in the way their nodes are ordered .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath15 are square matrices of the same size , then we write @xmath16 if @xmath9 implies @xmath17 , that is , the set of non - zero entries of @xmath0 is a subset of the set of non - zero entries of @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath16 , then @xmath2 is a subgraph of @xmath18 .",
    "we write @xmath19 if both @xmath16 and @xmath20 .",

    "consider the following @xmath36 incidence matrix :    @xmath37    let @xmath38 be the vector of edge weight variables and @xmath23 be a variable for the regularization degree .",

    "the set of non - trivial solutions of system ( [ eq : system ] ) induces the following _ regularization hierarchy _ of graphs :    * _ negatively regularizable graphs _ : those graphs for which there exists at least one solution @xmath43 and @xmath21 of system ( [ eq : system ] ) .",

    "@xmath10 is positively regularizable ( regularizable ) if and only if @xmath10 is either elementary bipartite or 2-bicritical .",
    "a bipartite graph is elementary if and only if it is connected and each edge is included in a perfect matching .",
    "a graph @xmath10 is 2-bicritical if and only if for every nonempty independent set @xmath216 of nodes of @xmath10 it holds that @xmath259 .    in @xcite",
    "the vulnerability of an undirected graph @xmath10 is defined as @xmath260 where @xmath216 is any independent nonempty set of nodes of @xmath10 .",
    "it holds that @xmath261 if and only if @xmath10 is nonnegatively regularizable . in addition @xmath262 if and only if @xmath10 is 2-bicritical . hence , nonnegatively",
    "regularizable graphs , and in particular , positively regularizable ones tend to have low vulnerability . on the other hand , this does not hold for negatively regularizable graphs : as an example , consider the square @xmath101 matrix    @xmath263    matrix @xmath0 is chainable and hence @xmath2 is negatively regularizable .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath264 , hence the vulnerability of @xmath2 can be arbitrarily high as the graph grows .",
    "the condition of having total support for a matrix can be tested via dulmage - mendelsohn decomposition : if a square matrix @xmath0 has support then there exist two permutations @xmath12 and @xmath77 such that @xmath201 is block upper triangular with square and fully indecomposable diagonal blocks , see @xcite . once the decomposition in blocks has been computed , testing total support amounts in checking that each of the @xmath26 positive entries of the matrix ( edges of the corresponding graph ) belongs to one of the square diagonal blocks determined by the decomposition",
    "the cost of computing the decomposition is @xmath265 @xcite , and this is also the overall cost of checking total support .",
    "since , by theorem [ th : regularizability ] , total support is equivalent to positive regularizability , the same complexity bound extends to testing positive regularizability .    the problem or regularizability could be seen as a member of a wide family of problems concerning the existence of matrices with prescribed conditions on the entries and on sums of certain subsets of the entries , typically row and columns @xcite .",
    "additional conditions on the matrices can be imposed , such as , for example , symmetry or skew - symmetry @xcite .",
    "actually , brualdi in @xcite gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a nonnegative rectangular matrix with a given zero pattern and prescribed row and column sums .",
    "in @xcite these results are generalized in various directions and in particular by considering the prescription that the entries of the matrix belong to finite or ( half)infinite intervals ( thus encompassing the case where some entries are prescribed to be zero or positive or nonnegative or are unrestricted ) . the results presented in this paper are not implied by the above described literature . moreover ,",
    "our approach to regularizability is graph - theoretic .",
    "by generalizing the problem of graph regularization to directed graphs , possibly weighted with negative values , we defined a hierarchy of four nested graph classes corresponding to as many matrix classes .",
    "we found structural characterizations of the classes both in terms of graphs and corresponding matrices , and discussed the computational problem of deciding the positioning of a graph in the hierarchy .",
    "we argued that the regularization solution might be useful to alleviate tension in real weighted networks with great disparity of centralities ( and power ) among nodes . in real cases , moving from an irregular real weighted network toward a regular ideal weighted network might be costly ( in terms of time and other relevant resources ) , since a central authority has to negotiate new force relations among players of the network .",
    "moreover , we expect that the cost of this transformation is proportional to the distance between the real weight assignment and the ideal one .",
    "hence , for networks that admit a regularization solution , the optimum is to find the closest regularization solution to the real weight assignment , which amounts to solve a minimization problem similar to the following : @xmath266          c.  berge , some common properties for regularizable graphs , edge - critical graphs and b - graphs , in : n.  saito , t.  nishizeki ( eds . ) , graph theory and algorithms , vol .",
