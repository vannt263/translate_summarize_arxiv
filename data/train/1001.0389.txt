    "the inclusive hadronic decay width of the @xmath0 lepton provides one of the most precise measurements of the strong coupling @xcite .",
    "moreover , the comparison of @xmath1 with @xmath3 determinations at higher energies constitutes the most accurate test of asymptotic freedom , successfully confirming the predicted running of the qcd coupling at the four - loop level .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath2 contribution @xcite has triggered a renewed theoretical interest on the @xmath1 determination , since it allows to push the accuracy to the four - loop level @xcite .",
    "however , the recent theoretical analyses slightly disagree on the final result , giving rise to a range of different values for @xmath1 .",
    "the differences among these results , shown in table  [ tab : alpha - pub - values ] , are too large compared with the claimed @xmath2 accuracy and originate in the different inputs or theoretical procedures which have been adopted .    in the following",
    "i try to clarify the reasons behind these numerical discrepancies and reassess the actual uncertainties of the @xmath0 decay determination of @xmath3 . using all present experimental and theoretical knowledge , i derive the value [ eq : alpha - result ] _",

    ".@xmath2 determinations of @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table  [ tab : afun ] gives the numerical values for @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) obtained at the one- , two- , three- and four - loop approximations ( i.e. @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) , together with the corresponding results for @xmath10 , taking @xmath11 .",
    "the perturbative convergence is very good .",
    "the error induced by the truncation of the @xmath12 function at fourth order can be conservatively estimated through the variation of the results at five loops , assuming @xmath13 , i.e. a geometric growth of the @xmath12 function .",
    "higher - order contributions to the adler function @xmath14 will be taken into account adding the fifth - order term @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "including , moreover , the 5-loop variation with changes of the renormalization scale in the range @xmath17 $ ] , one gets the final result @xmath18 for @xmath11 .    adopting this very conservative procedure , the experimental value of @xmath19 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta_p ] ) implies the strong coupling determination quoted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha - result ] ) .",
    "the integrals @xmath4 can be expanded in powers of @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "one recovers in this way the naive perturbative expansion @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this approximation is known as _ fixed - order perturbation theory _ ( fopt ) , while the improved expression ( [ eq : r_k_exp ] ) , keeping the non - expanded values for the integrals @xmath4 , is usually called _ contour - improved perturbation theory _ ( cipt ) @xcite .",
    "fopt gives rise to a pathological non - convergent series ( its radius of convergence is slightly smaller than the physical value of @xmath23 ) , because the long running of @xmath24 along the circle @xmath25 generates very large @xmath26 coefficients , which depend on @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "these corrections are much larger than the original @xmath34 contributions and lead to values of @xmath1 smaller than ( [ eq : alpha - result ] ) .",
    "fopt suffers from a huge renormalization - scale dependence @xcite .",
    "as shown in a recent detailed analysis @xcite , the actual fopt uncertainties are much larger than usually estimated .",
    "once this is taken properly into account , the fopt results are consistent with cipt , but their huge uncertainties make them irrelevant .    an ad - hoc model of higher - order coefficients for the adler function has been recently advocated @xcite .",
    "the model mixes three different types of renormalons ( @xmath35 , 2 and 3 ) plus a linear polynomial , trying to enforce a cancelation of the @xmath34 and @xmath26 coefficients in order to get a better behaviour of the fopt series .",
    "it contains 5 free parameters which are determined by the known coefficients of the adler series and the chosen value of @xmath36 . making a borel summation of the full renormalon series ( bsr ) ,",
    "one gets a sizeable positive contribution to @xmath19 from higher orders , implying a smaller value for @xmath1 independently of the adopted fopt @xcite or cipt @xcite procedure .",
    "this model constitutes an interesting example of possible higher - order corrections , making apparent that the associated uncertainties have to be carefully estimated .",
    "however , it can not be used to determine the physical value of @xmath3 , because the result is model dependent .",
    "different assumptions about the unknown @xmath34 coefficients would lead to different central values for @xmath3 .",
