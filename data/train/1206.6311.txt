    "low scale supersymmetry ( susy ) , augmented by an unbroken r - parity , largely overcomes the gauge hierarchy problem encountered in the standard model ( sm ) and also provides a compelling cold dark matter candidate . in most supersymmetric models , like msugra / constrained minimal supersymmetric model ( cmssm )  @xcite , the susy mass scale is very closely tied to the mass scale of the higgs vacuum expectation value and all susy mass terms are of the order of a few hundred gev .",
    "thus the first two family squarks and gluino have very large production cross sections at hadron colliders .",
    "however , these predicted large cross sections have not been discovered with multiple energetic jets plus large missing energy signature with the integrated luminosity of up to 5 fb@xmath3 at @xmath5 tev lhc  @xcite .    despite the lack of evidence for susy at the lhc so far , susy remains a very attractive possibility for physics at the tev scale .",
    "cohen , kaplan and nelson once introduced the `` more minimal supersymmetric standard model ''  @xcite , in which only the third generation sfermions and gauginos are light .",
    "this scenario of superparticle spectrum can also be realized in a class of supersymmetric models accommodating the stable lightest neutralino ( lsp ) compatible with the wmap dark matter measurement  @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the bino lsp and the relevant lightest squark , namely nlsp stop ( where nlsp stands for next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ) are sufficiently close together in mass , such that the ensuing co - annihilation processes in the early universe allow one to reproduce the desired bino relic density  @xcite . besides the co - annihilation scenario , there are other motivations supporting the lighter stop to be the nlsp with the mass even smaller than the top quark mass , for instance the electroweak baryongenesis  @xcite and the naturalness in electroweak symmetry breaking in the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the direct search for nlsp stop , especially in the region of nearly degenerate stop and lsp neutralino masses , is challenging and has been implemented by both lep and tevatron  @xcite .",
    "they put limit on the nlsp stop mass as @xmath6 gev from lep - ii and @xmath7 gev from cdf run - ii .",
    "however , the tevatron bound does not cover the co - annihilation region above the lep limit  @xcite .",
    "two alternative search methods have been proposed to detect light stop instead of searching for pure stop pair production events .",
    "one of them is to consider stop pair production associated with a hard qcd jet  @xcite . in the co - annihilation region",
    ", there will be minimal hadronic activity associated with the stop decay and therefore this channel would effectively lead to events with hard jets and large missing energy .",
    "recently , it is found that co - annihilation region with @xmath8 gev is essentially ruled out in light of 7 tev lhc data with 1 fb@xmath3 integrated luminosity  @xcite .",
    "the other proposed method takes advantage of the majorana fermion feature of gluino and considers gluino pair production followed by gluino decay into on - shell stop and top quark  @xcite .",
    "the pair production of gluinos leads to the events containing same - sign dilepton signature arising from the same - sign top quarks leptonic decay and induces negligible standard model ( sm ) backgrounds .    on the other hand ,",
    "lhc collaborations , atlas and cms have performed analyses for events containing two same - sign isolated leptons plus hadronic jets and missing energy at a center - of - mass energy of 7 tev  @xcite .",
    "good agreement was observed between the number of events in data and the sm predictions .",
    "they could apply for the second nlsp stop search scenario mentioned above , namely gluino pair production with gluino decay into top and stop and make improved constraints on relevant parameter space beyond lep and tevatron . in this paper",
    ", we would like to study the 7 tev lhc impact on the scenario of heavy gluino decay into nlsp stop and predict the discovery limits at both 8 and 14 tev lhc .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the nlsp stop decay and production modes and outline the selection requirements employed by the lhc collaborations .",
    "the kinematic features of nlsp stop production are also presented together with constrained parameter space in terms of the masses of gluino , stop and neutralino .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section iii .",
    "to explore common features of nlsp stop scenario model - independently , we adopt the concept of so - called `` simplified models '' paradigm  @xcite .",
    "simplified models parameterize the new physics by a simple particle spectrum , its production mode and decay topologies with the masses , cross sections and branching ratios taken as free parameters .",
    "particles that are not involved in a specific signature are assumed to be decoupled . for our case , we have three free mass parameters , namely gluino mass @xmath9 , the lighter stop mass @xmath10 and neutralino lsp mass @xmath11 under the assumption that all other superparticles decouple .    in the framework of mssm with",
    "gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking , the nlsp stop @xmath12 , with lsp neutralino , has the following decay channels @xmath13 assuming other superparticles decouple in simplified model , where @xmath14 and @xmath14 stand for sm leptons or quarks .",
    "these decays are all generated at tree level except for the first channel , which is loop - induced and proceeds through off - diagonal elements of ckm matrix .",
    "the three tree level channels gradually come into play from left to right , corresponding to increasing @xmath15 .",
    "they proceed through both off - shell top quark and @xmath16 boson exchange ( or sbottom , slepton , sneutrino , chargino ) , only off - shell top quark ( or sbottom , chargino ) , and via on - shell top quark respectively . in particular , for an extremely small @xmath17 , the nlsp stop decay products from the 4-body channel ( @xmath18 ) are much softer and thus harder to detect compared to the 2-body channel ( @xmath0 ) , and have not been searched in experiments so far .",
    "therefore , we scan the parameter region of @xmath10 and @xmath11 with varying @xmath17 and consider the related unique nlsp stop decay channels @xmath19 with 100% of decay branching fraction each .",
    "we further assume the nlsp stop associated with a top quark arises from the heavier gluino pair production and decay , with 50% of @xmath20 or @xmath21 decay branching ratio and mass range @xmath22 . from the well - known relation between gaugino masses at low energy in msugra",
    "/ cmssm , namely @xmath23 , which follows from the assumption of universal gaugino masses at high scale , the gluino mass is taken to be @xmath24 in the following studies . together with the three nlsp",
    "stop decay modes , one has the following same - sign dilepton productions @xmath25 note that the c mode provides the same - sign dilepton signal only when same - sign tops are produced as shown in eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) , as the stop has no leptonic decay product .",
    "by contrast , any @xmath26 and @xmath12 production configuration from gluino pair decay contributes to the same - sign dilepton signal for both the bw and t modes as shown in eqs .",

    "the atlas and cms collaborations have reported data in terms of events containing same - sign dilepton signature in @xmath5 tev proton - proton collisions .",
    "no excess above the sm background expectation was observed .",
    "this data can be employed , as we show below , to find more stringent constraints on the nlsp stop scenario .    in the cms analyses corresponding to 1 fb@xmath3 integrated luminosity , the events considered for search regions are all required to have two leptons with the same charge , at least two jets , and @xmath27 gev  @xcite .",
    "the cms selections are defined by three baselines : events with @xmath28 dilepton candidates ( inclusive dileptons ) , events with @xmath28 dilepton candidates with both leptons having @xmath29 gev , at least one lepton having @xmath30 gev(high-@xmath31 dileptons ) , and events with @xmath32 dilepton candidates ( @xmath33 dileptons ) .",
    "the following inclusive search regions are also defined to constrain the baseline selection categories : high-@xmath34 high-@xmath35 with @xmath36 gev and @xmath37 gev , medium-@xmath34 high-@xmath35 with @xmath38 gev and @xmath37 gev , high-@xmath34 low-@xmath35 with @xmath36 gev and @xmath39 gev , and low-@xmath34 high-@xmath35 with @xmath40 gev and @xmath41 gev , as shown in table  [ cuts4 ] .",
    "the observed upper limits on events from new physics for baseline 1 with regions 1 - 3 ( i1-i3 ) , baseline 2 with regions 1 - 4 ( h1-h4 ) , and baseline 3 with region 1 ( t1 ) are represented in the last row of table  [ cuts4 ] .",
