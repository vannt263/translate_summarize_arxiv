    "the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and the atlas detector  @xcite have been designed primarily for understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking and searching for potential new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "reaching such objectives set by the physics program places stringent requirements on understanding the performance of the atlas detector and its trigger system , the substructure of proton and the known sm processes in the new experimental conditions .",
    "the analyses presented in the next sections assume 1  fb@xmath0 of data or less at 14  tev centre of mass energy , though it is likely that there will be a period of running at 10  tev in the first year of the lhc operation .",
    "the lhc is capable of delivering 1  fb@xmath0 of data in just a few weeks at a moderate luminosity , @xmath1  @xmath2s@xmath0 .",
    "the work reported here is based on the full simulation of the detector response to a comprehensive list of physics processes of interest expected to be studied at the lhc . for more details and further studies ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the atlas detector will record the signals of the decay products of those particles of interest like the higgs boson .",
    "in general , these are charged leptons , photons , jets of hadrons and missing transverse energy , @xmath3 , ( e.g. neutrinos ) .",
    "the use of data only techniques to measure the performance of and to calibrate the detector is important during the initial stage of the experiment when monte carlo ( mc ) expectations need to be re - tuned with the understanding of this new energy regime . the well known and understood sm processes with low background rates such as the production and decay of the @xmath4 boson , @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons will be used for this purpose .",
    "the design goal for the atlas electromagnetic calorimeters was an overall constant term of less than 0.7% in the energy resolution .",
    "the local uniformity obtained from test beams and hardware calibration is less than 0.5% in regions of @xmath7 .",
    "inter - calibration of these regions is possible using @xmath8 events and constraining the invariant mass distribution of electron - positron pairs to the z boson line shape , well - measured at lep  @xcite .",
    "the method relies on the precise knowledge of the amount of material in front of the calorimeters .",
    "the calibration accuracy obtained from this method is expected to be about 0.4% using only 100  pb@xmath0 of data , and hence it is possible to achieve the goal of 0.7% global uniformity . the absolute electromagnetic energy scale can also be obtained from this method and is expected to be known to less than 0.5% for the full @xmath9 spectrum up to 500  gev in the central pseudo - rapidity , @xmath10 , with 200  pb@xmath0 of data . with more statistics , the goal is to achieve 0.1% or better on the absolute electromagnetic scale .    the momentum scale and the resolution of muons measured with the atlas muon spectrometers can be determined using @xmath11 events .",
    "an accuracy of better than 1% in momentum scale is obtained with 100  pb@xmath0 of data .",
    "the resolution for transverse momenta in the range 10  gev/@xmath12 to 500  gev/@xmath12 is better than 4% for the spectrometer with chambers aligned to 30  @xmath13 m .",
    "the resolution degrades in the case of misaligned chambers .",
    "for instance , misalignment of the chambers by 1  mm results in a 12% momentum resolution .",
    "the atlas calorimeters are non - compensating , and therefore , jets reconstructed from the calorimeter cells that are calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale need to be re - calibrated to the hadronic energy scale .",
    "the accuracy of the jet calibration can be measured using @xmath14+jet or @xmath4+jet events .",
    "one of the methods studied in atlas is the @xmath15 balance method in which the @xmath15 of the @xmath14 or the @xmath4 boson ( @xmath16 decays in particular ) is compared to that of the jet to determine the absolute hadronic energy scale . for high @xmath15 in the range 100  gev/@xmath12 to 500  gev/@xmath12",
    ", @xmath14+jet events are used , and the energy scale should be known to a statistical precision of better than 1% with 100  pb@xmath0 of data . at low @xmath15 ,",
    "@xmath4+jet events maybe used due to lower qcd multi - jets background rates resulting in a statistical uncertainty on the energy scale of less than 1% that can be achieved with 300  pb@xmath0 of data .",
    "the @xmath3 scale can be measured to better than 8% with 100  pb@xmath0 of data using @xmath17 events with one @xmath18 decaying leptonically .",
    "the @xmath3 resolution is determined using @xmath19 or @xmath20 events , which should in principle have no missing energy .",
    "the resolution in the direction longitudinal to the @xmath4 boson momentum is about 3.5  gev when the scalar sum of the energy , @xmath21 , in the hadronic calorimeters is 20  gev and is better than 6  gev for @xmath22  gev .",
    "the trigger , reconstruction and identification efficiencies of leptons can be determined from data only using a technique called tag & probe .",
    "the drell - yan resonances @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 will be used to calculate the desired efficiency depending on the lepton @xmath15 range of interest .    in the tag & probe method",
    ", one first selects a fairly clean ( low background ) sample of events with two potential lepton candidates whose invariant mass is required to match those of one of the resonances considered .",
    "one of these lepton candidates is required to have passed all the selection criteria including trigger and is called the tag .",
    "the other one is tested for a particular selection to determine the efficiency and is called the probe .",
    "the method is found to give consistent results with mc predictions .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of this method is better than 2% when the @xmath4 resonance is used .",
    "the charge misidentification rate obtained using the tag & probe method is less than 0.2% in the central pseudo - rapidity region .",
    "determining the cross sections of observed physical processes is important when studying a new energy regime and searching for new physics . in order to calculate a cross section at the lhc",
    ", one needs to know the probability of finding a particular pair of partons interacting at a momentum transfer @xmath23 and carrying certain fractions , @xmath24 of the proton momentum .",
    "such information is provided in the form of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and currently these distributions have to be determined from experimental data . since the lhc kinematic range in @xmath24 and @xmath23 is much bigger than any previous experiment , pdf uncertainty is one of the most dominant systematics , and it can limit discovery potential for new physics .    in atlas , various measurements are envisioned to further constrain pdfs . the rapidity distribution , @xmath25 , of the @xmath4 boson and invariant mass spectrum , @xmath26 , of low mass ( 20  gev/@xmath27 - 60  gev/@xmath27 ) drell - yan lepton pairs can be used to constrain sea quark pdfs and low-@xmath24 theory in general .",
    "the @xmath28 boson and @xmath14+jet events will be used to improve gluon pdfs . a 40% reduction in gluon pdf uncertainty",
    "should be obtained using 50  pb@xmath0 of @xmath29 data  @xcite .",
    "measurements of the inclusive production cross sections of the @xmath28 and @xmath4 bosons are crucial in understanding the sm at energies never before studied as well as testing of precise theoretical expectations . at 14  tev ,",
    "the production cross sections of the @xmath28 and @xmath4 bosons decaying into leptons are about 20  nb and 2  nb , respectively .",
    "the measurement of the masses of the @xmath28 boson and the @xmath30 quark at atlas will improve upon the already very precise values of these parameters and will further constrain the predicted mass of the sm higgs boson . further improvement on the precision of the masses of the @xmath28 and @xmath30 will only be possible with much more than 1  fb@xmath0 of data .",
    "the typical selection of @xmath19 or @xmath20 events includes using a single lepton trigger , finding a pair of oppositely charged leptons of invariant mass in the range @xmath31  gev/@xmath27 , requiring each lepton to have @xmath32  gev , @xmath33 and to be isolated . the most dominant background comes from qcd multi - jet events .",
    "the expected statistical uncertainty on the cross section is already less than 1% with 50  pb@xmath0 of data , while the systematic uncertainty is about 4% excluding the uncertainty on the luminosity which is expected be better than 30% at the early stages of data taking .",
    "the @xmath29 or @xmath34 events are selected similarly with a single lepton trigger , finding an isolated lepton with @xmath35  gev and @xmath33 , an @xmath36  gev and requiring the transverse momentum @xmath37 of the @xmath28 be greater than 40  gev/@xmath27 .",
    "qcd multi - jets background is also the most dominant in this case .",
    "the statistical uncertainty is about 0.2% with 50  pb@xmath0 of data .",
    "a 5% systematic uncertainty is expected excluding the luminosity uncertainty .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath28 mass can not be made directly due to the neutrino from the @xmath28 decay escaping undetected .",
    "instead , the @xmath38 of the lepton or the @xmath39 of the @xmath28 boson , both of which are sensitive to the mass , can be used .",
    "the @xmath40 distribution has a jacobian peak at @xmath41/2 , whilst the @xmath39 peaks at @xmath41 .",
    "the selection of @xmath42 events include using a single lepton trigger , requiring an isolated lepton of @xmath43  gev/@xmath12 and @xmath33 , an @xmath44  gev and ensuring that the hadronic recoil @xmath15 is less than 50  gev/@xmath12 . for electrons , the barrel - endcap transition region ( @xmath45 ) of the calorimeter",
    "is also excluded from selection . in order to determine the mass of the @xmath28 , template distributions of @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "are generated with various assumed values of @xmath41 , smeared for detector response and compared to the measured distribution to find the best matching template and therefore the mass of the @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath19 or @xmath20 events are used to measure the detector response . the uncertainty on the mass of @xmath28 using @xmath38 method with 15  pb@xmath46 of data is expected to be @xmath47(stat)@xmath48(sys )  mev/@xmath27 in the electron channel .",
    "the most dominant uncertainty comes from the lepton energy scale . with the @xmath49 method ,",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath41 is @xmath50(stat)@xmath51(sys )  mev/@xmath27 estimated in the muon channel .",
    "the @xmath3 scale is the most dominant source of uncertainty in this method .",
    "the most dominant theoretical uncertainty for both methods is the uncertainty on the pdfs .",
    "one important property of @xmath39 is its independence of the @xmath52 of the @xmath28 .",
    "thus , this distribution is much less sensitive to the modelling of the @xmath28 boson recoil .",
    "the @xmath30 quark mass , @xmath53 , will be measured at atlas using @xmath54 events .",
    "the production cross section of @xmath54 pairs is about 0.83  nb at 14  tev . the most promising channel for a precise measurement is expected to be the semi - leptonic decay in which one of the @xmath28 bosons decays leptonically while the other decays hadronically resulting in a lepton , an @xmath3 and four - jets signature , with two of the jets coming from the @xmath55 quarks .",
    "events are selected with a single lepton trigger and must have a lepton of @xmath56  gev/@xmath12 , an @xmath57  gev and at least four jets , three of which with @xmath58  gev/@xmath12 and one with @xmath56  gev/@xmath12 .",
    "there are many studies performed in atlas to determine @xmath53 .",
    "two of those methods are the @xmath59 and the geometric method .",
    "the goal of both methods is to find those three jets ( one must be a @xmath55-jet ) which come from the hadronically decaying @xmath30 quark and are to be used for the mass determination .",
    "the @xmath59 method makes use of the @xmath55-tagging capabilities of the detector to reduce the combinatorial background and applies a @xmath59 minimization to find the two light jets which come from the @xmath28 decay .",
    "the @xmath59 minimization constrains the mass of the light jet pair to @xmath41 by re - scaling energies of the jets .",
    "the light and @xmath55-jet energy scales are the most dominant systematic uncertainties for the @xmath59 method .",
    "the effect of these scales on the @xmath30 quark mass uncertainty is 0.2  gev/@xmath27/% and 0.7  gev/@xmath27/% respectively .",
    "for example , a 1% @xmath55-jet energy scale uncertainty gives an expectation of a 0.7  gev/@xmath27 uncertainty on the mass of the @xmath30 quark .",
    "assuming both the light and @xmath55-jet energy scale uncertainties are known to 1% , the total systematic uncertainty on @xmath53 with this method is about 1  gev/@xmath27 . the statistical uncertainty is less than 0.4  gev/@xmath27 with 1  fb@xmath0 of data .",
    "the geometric method , on the other hand , does not use @xmath55-tagging and is complementary to the @xmath59 method especially during the early stages of the experiment until the detector calibration matures .",
    "this method simply chooses the two geometrically closest jets with invariant mass around the @xmath41 .",
    "lack of b - tagging in the geometric method results in a higher rate of combinatorial background and an uncertainty of about 1  gev/@xmath27 on @xmath53 .",
    "the overall systematic uncertainty on @xmath53 with this method is 2  gev/@xmath27 assuming 1% uncertainty on the jet ( light or @xmath55 ) energy scale .",
    "studying sm processes and re - measuring its parameters are not only important for understanding of the atlas detector , but are also essential in order to be able to discover new physics .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on sm measurements will be negligible at lhc .",
    "therefore it is possible to improve the uncertainty even on the already precisely measured sm parameters as understanding of the response of the atlas detector advances .",
