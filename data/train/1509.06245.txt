    "the problem of forcing a diffusion process to a final attainable configuration starting from an initial distribution has been of particular interest from both physical and mathematical points of view ( e.g. , see @xcite for the original formulation of this problem ) .",
    "notably , this problem and its variants have been widely studied in the literature ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite @xcite or @xcite in the context of stochastic optimal transportation problem ; see also @xcite and @xcite in the context of variational characterization of schrdinger processes ; and @xcite or @xcite in the context of controllability of systems governed by parabolic pdes ) .",
    "the setting of these papers , which is the rationale behind our approach , consists of constructing a class of stochastic processes ( i.e. , a reciprocal precess along the works of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) in connection with stochastic optimal control theory with respect to the desired end - point distributions or in connection with that of the problem of minimizing relative entropy subject to the controlled and reference diffusion processes ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for additional discussions ) . here , our main interest is to throw some light on the structure of the controlled - diffusion process pertaining to a chain of distributed systems and , at the same time , clarifying questions concerning minimization of relative entropy subject to the initial and desired final attainable distributions for such a controlled - diffusion process .    in this paper , we specifically consider the following distributed system , which is formed by a chain of @xmath0 subsystems ( where @xmath1 ) , with a random perturbation that enters only in the first subsystem and is then subsequently transmitted to other subsystems , i.e. , @xmath2 where    * @xmath3 is an @xmath4-valued state information for the @xmath5th subsystem , with @xmath6 , * @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for @xmath9 , are bounded continuous functions and satisfy appropriate hlder conditions , * @xmath10 is a bounded continuous function , with the least eigenvalue of @xmath11 uniformly bounded away from zero , i.e. , @xmath12 for some @xmath13 , * @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 ) is a @xmath16-dimensional standard wiener process .",
    "note that such a chain of distributed systems has been well discussed in various applications ( e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath17 , the equation in can be used to describe stochastic hamiltonian systems ( e.g. , see @xcite or @xcite for additional discussions ) .",
