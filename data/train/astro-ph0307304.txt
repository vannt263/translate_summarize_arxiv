    "v445 puppis - a nova like object - was first reported to be in outburst on 30 december 2000 by kanatsu ( kato and kanatsu 2000 ) .",
    "the exact time of the of the object s eruption is not certain - an aspect that is discussed in sect .",
    "spectra in the visible region , taken in the early stages after the detection , showed many permitted lines of feii , cai , caii , oi and nai ( fujii 2001 ; liller 2001a , b ; shemmer et al .",
    "2001 ; wagner et al . 2001a , b ) .",
    "a striking feature of the optical spectra was the absence of hydrogen lines in the spectra .",
    "near ir spectra reported here also confirm the absence of paschen and brackett hydrogen lines in the @xmath0 bands .",
    "the deficiency of hydrogen in v445 puppis shows that it is not an usual nova and shows the strangeness of the object .",
    "this point is also made by wagner et al .",
    "( 2001a ) who state that the optical spectrum of v445 puppis is not typical of classical feii type novae , recurrent novae or symbiotic novae .",
    "mid ir ( 3 - 14 @xmath1 m ) spectroscopy by lynch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reveal only a smooth featureless continuum deviating significantly from a black body distribution and which can be explained by invoking the presence of dust .",
    "another interesting development in the evolution of v445 puppis was the detection at radio wavelengths almost a year after the outburst ( rupen et al .",
    "radio emission has been seen in a few novae ( seaquist 1989 ) but such emission has the characteristics of thermal bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by ionized gas . in v445 puppis , non - thermal synchrotron radiation is seen which is rather rare ( another example of this being the old nova remnant gk persei ) .",
    "thus v445 puppis has all the hallmarks of being a very interesting object .",
    "+ in this work , we mainly present spectroscopic results ( and also some photometric data ) from @xmath0 observations of v445 puppis made at five , fairly evenly - spaced epochs . these should help in following the temporal evolution of v445 puppis and understanding it s puzzling nature .",
    "from our results it would appear that v445 puppis is a fairly unique object and could be a helium nova .",
    "a helium nova is believed to occur due to a thermo - nuclear runaway on the surface of a degenerate white dwarf accreting helium from it s helium - rich companion ( kato et al . 1989 ) .",
    "the nova ejecta , in such an outburst , is expected to be hydrogen - deficient as found in v445 puppis .",
    "near - ir @xmath0 spectra at a resolution of @xmath5 1000 were obtained at the mt .",
    "abu 1.2 m telescope using a near infrared imager / spectrometer with a 256@xmath6256 hgcdte nicmos3 array .",
    "we present here the spectroscopic observations of five days viz .",
    "january 1.63 ut , january 20.81 ut , february 1.73 ut , february 18.70 ut and march 1.66 ut , 2001 . in each of the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "bands a set of at least two spectra were taken . in",
    "each set the star was offset to two different positions of the slit ( slit width @xmath10 2 arc sec .  ) .",
    "the signal to noise ratio of the spectra , as determined using iraf , is moderate and ranges between 30 to 60 in the @xmath0 bands .",
    "the exposure times for the spectra were typically between 60 to 120 seconds .",
    "spectral calibration was done using the oh sky lines that register with the spectra .",
    "the comparison star hr 2988 was used for ratioing the spectra in all cases .",
    "we believe the telluric lines , present in the spectra , have been well removed in the process of ratioing .",
    "this is because of i ) the close proximity of hr 2988 to v445 puppis and ii ) also the small time gap ( typically 10 - 15 minutes ) between observing the spectra of v445 puppis and hr 2988 in any of the @xmath0 bands .",
    "this ensures that both the stars were at a similar airmass .",
    "the ratioing process should therefore remove the telluric lines reasonably well .",
    "+ photometry in the @xmath0 bands was performed on january 2.90 ut and november 1.96 ut , 2001 using the nicmos3 array , mentioned above , in the imaging mode .",
    "the sky was photometric on both days with a typical seeing of 1 arc second .",
    "several frames in 4 dithered positions , offset from each other by 30 arcsec , were obtained in all the filters .",
    "the times for all the individual frames was 100 ms on 2 jan . 01 and ranged between 30 to 60s on 1 nov . 01 .",
    "the total integration time in each of the dithered positions are as follows i ) 400 ms in each of the @xmath0 bands for 2 jan.01 and ii ) 3 minutes in @xmath7 and 90s in @xmath8 on 1 nov . 01 .",
    "the sky frames were generated using these dithered frames .",
    "the mean air - mass at the time of observations for v445 puppis was 1.79 on 2 jan . 01 and 1.59 on 1 nov . 01 .",
    "the ukirt standard star hd 77281 was used for photometric calibration on 2 jan . 01 and observed soon after v838 mon . as a crosscheck ,",
    "hr 2956 ( @xmath11= 6.50 , spectral type b7v ) was also observed .",
    "the adopted @xmath0 magnitudes for hr 2956 were taken from the 2mass survey to be @xmath7 = 6.642 , @xmath8 = 6.723 and @xmath9 = 6.686 .",
    "for the 1 nov 01 observations , fs 13 ( @xmath7 = 10.517 , @xmath8 = 10.189 and @xmath9 = 10.137 ) was used as the standard star ( hunt et al .",

    "the outburst date of v445 puppis is uncertain but can be constrained from the vsnet reports .",
    "this part of the sky has been monitored by takamizawa between march 1994 to december 1999 and he does not find any object brighter than 14 magnitude on his photographic plates ( iauc 7552 ) .",
    "subsequent photographic records from vsnet ( http://www .",
    "kusastro.kyoto-u.ac.jp.vsnet ) show that the object was fainter than 12th magnitude on 26 september 2000 and had brightened to 8.8 magnitude by 23 november 2000 .",

    "the spectra have been offset from each other for clarity.,width=307,height=432 ]      the main thrust of this work has been in the @xmath0 spectroscopy of v445 puppis .",

    "the @xmath0 spectra are shown in figs . 2 , 3 and 4 .",

    "their identification and other relevant details , are listed in table 1 .",
    "almost all the lines that are present appear to be due to neutral carbon .",
    "the identification of the ci lines is done on two bases .",
    "first we have compared the strengths and positions of these lines with the laboratory ir spectra of ci as given by johansson & litzen ( 1965 ) and johansson ( 1966 ) and a good match is found .",
    "furthermore , we have computed a simple model spectrum that should arise from ci emission from the shell . for this spectrum",
    ", we have selected 170 of the strongest ci lines between 1.08 and 2.5 @xmath1 m with their transition probabilities , from the atomic line list compiled by kurucz ( http://kurucz.harvard.edu/linelists.html ) .",
    "the strength of any line is computed as follows .",
    "if the line originates in a downward transition from level 2 to 1 then , the luminosity of the line @xmath16@xmath17 is given by :    @xmath18    where @xmath19@xmath20 is the number density of ci atoms in the excited state 2 , @xmath21@xmath22 is the einstein coefficient of spontaneous emission , @xmath23@xmath24 is the energy of the emitted photon and @xmath11 is the volume of the emitting gas .",
    "+ from eq .",
    "( 1 ) , it is seen that , the strength of any line will essentially depend only on @xmath21@xmath22 and @xmath19@xmath20 . if the populations of the upper level ( @xmath19@xmath20 ) for the different ci lines are temporarily assumed to be the same",
    ", then the line strength depends basically only on @xmath21@xmath22 . knowing the transition probabilities , we have computed the relative line strengths from eq .",
    "we assume that the shape of each line can be reasonably represented by a gaussian whose fwhm has been chosen to be approximately 1500 km / s - representative of the observed linewidths in v445 puppis .",
    "co - addition of all the gaussians - corresponding to all the lines- yields a model spectrum which is shown in fig . 5 ( labeled as model 1 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath7 band spectrum of 1 jan .",
    "01 , in which the emission lines are most prominent , is also shown in the same figure for comparison .",
    "a more accurate calculation has taken into account the population of the upper levels @xmath19@xmath20 in calculating the relative line strengths .",
    "assuming the emitting gas to be in local thermal equilibrium , @xmath19@xmath20 will be given by a boltzmann distribution viz .",
    "@xmath25    where @xmath26 is the partition function , @xmath27 is the temperature of the gas , @xmath28@xmath29 is the energy difference between the ground state and level 2 , @xmath30@xmath20 is the statistical weight of the upper level and @xmath31 is the total number density of the carbon atoms .",
    "the energy level values for the different states ( to compute @xmath28@xmath32 ) and @xmath30@xmath20 values have been taken from kurucz s line list .",
    "the partition function values , for different temperatures , have been taken from allen ( 1976 ) and aller ( 1963 ) .",
    "+     band spectra of 1 jan . 01 .",
    "the details are available in the text of sect .",
    "3.2.,width=307 ]    nova shell ejecta have temperatures typically in the range 4000 - 5000k ( williams 1994 ) .",
    "however we find slightly higher temperatures reproduce the observed spectra better .",
    "in particular , the model spectrum computed for t = 8000k ( labeled as model 2 ) is also shown in fig .",
    "changes in the adopted temperature do change the relative strength of the different lines , but marginally , and not in any drastic fashion .",
    "however , the primary purpose of the simulated spectra of fig .",
    "5 is only to secure the identification of the ci lines .",
    "5 only shows graphically the expected positions of the ci lines and gives a rough simulation of their expected strengths . as may be seen all the strong ci lines are reproduced , and to a large extent , even the weaker lines .",
    "based on the results of fig .",
    "5 , it would appear reasonable to identify most of the observed lines in the @xmath7 band with ci . the model spectra for @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "have also been computed but not shown here .",
    "the model results for @xmath8 band show the strongest ci line to be at 1.69 @xmath1 m which matches what is observed at that wavelength .",
    "a few other lines between 1.7 to 1.8 @xmath1 m are predicted as well ( weaker than the 1.69 @xmath1 m line ) .",
    "their positions have been marked in the @xmath8 band spectra of fig .",
    "3 and these lines are also seen in our data . in the @xmath9 band",
    "no line of any significant strength is predicted .",
    "this agrees with the rather featureless @xmath9 band spectra that we observe ( fig .",
    "4 ) . + in table 1 , we have given the equivalent widths for the emission features seen in the spectra of 1 jan .",
    "01 where the lines are the strongest .",
    "since some of the features are blended , we have given the combined equivalent width of the blend .",
    "in particular , combined equivalent width s have been given in table 1 for features 3 to 5 and 6 to 10 which are blended .",
    "the reality of the features can be judged by comparing their equivalent widths with those of modulations in the continuum due to noise .",
    "the equivalent width values for such modulations are in the range of 3 to 7@xmath33 in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 band spectra . in comparison , on 1 march 2001 , when the lines were the weakest , the equivalent widths for the features which are clearly discernible viz . 1 , 2 , 3 - 5 , 6 - 10 , 11 and 12 are 25 , 39 , 102 , 27 , 22 and 41@xmath33 respectively .",
    "the noise in the continuum has similar equivalent widths as before .",
    "in general , the @xmath8 band features are a little noisy except for the 1.689 @xmath1 m line .",
    "+ while it appears that ci is the main contributor to the @xmath0 spectra , it is possible that there is some contribution from cii also .",
    "this is specially so because cii lines have been seen in the optical spectra as will be discussed shortly .",
    "we have determined some of the stronger cii lines ( based primarily on their transition probabilities ) in the @xmath0 region from kurucz s line list .",
    "it will need a detailed model - beyond the scope of this work - to calculate the absolute strengths of these cii lines vis - a - vis the ci lines .",
    "but their expected wavelength positions should give some indication whether they are present in the @xmath0 spectra or not .",
    "the expected cii lines are found to lie at wavelengths of 1.093 , 1.144 , 1.158 , 1.674 , 1.700 and 2.222 @xmath1 m .",
    "there is a line at 1.09 @xmath1 m which is consistently seen in the observed spectra - this could be due to cii . out of the other cii lines the 1.144 , 1.158 and 1.700 @xmath1 m lines may be present in the observed spectra .",
    "the 1.144 and 1.158 @xmath1 m cii lines could be lying on the wings of the observed 1.133 and 1.165 @xmath1 m ci lines - giving them a slightly broader appearance .",
    "similarly , the expected 1.700 @xmath1 m cii line may be blended with the 1.689 @xmath1 m ci line .",
    "thus there is some evidence for the presence of cii in the @xmath0 spectra .",
    "it must be mentioned that in an earlier iau circular ( ashok & banerjee 2001 ) we had attributed some of the ci lines reported here to ciii and civ .",
    "this was because some ciii and civ lines do occur at similar wavelengths as ci - for e.g. as seen in the spectra of wolf - rayet stars ( eenens et al .",
    "but some of these strong ciii and civ lines are not seen here .",
    "furthermore , since lines from low - ionization species have been definitely identified in the optical spectra of v445 puppis , it is more consistent to attribute the observed emission lines to ci ( with some contribution from cii possibly ) , rather than high - ionization species like ciii or civ .",
    "it may be seen from the @xmath0 spectra that v445 pup is hydrogen - deficient . in the @xmath9 band",
    "there is no sign of the brackett gamma ( br@xmath34 ) line at 2.1656 @xmath1 m .",
    "similarly other brackett series lines ( brackett 10 to 19 ) which are commonly seen in the @xmath8 band in the spectra of classical novae are missing .",
    "paschen beta ( pa@xmath35 ) at 1.2818 @xmath1 m is also not present in the @xmath7 band spectrum . the only possible indication for the presence of hydrogen is the 1.09 @xmath1 m line which coincides with paschen gamma ( pa@xmath34 ) .",
    "however , pa@xmath34 is expected to be weaker than pa@xmath35 which , in the present data , is completely absent .",
    "hence it is difficult to attribute this line to hydrogen pa@xmath34 and it is more likely to be due to cii as discussed earlier .",
    "+ we do not find the signature of helium lines in the @xmath0 spectra .",
    "however , the presence of he is more conclusively seen in the optical spectra wherein several hei lines are prominently seen ( wagner et al .",
    "2001c ) while at the same time the hydrogen - deficiency is manifested by the weakness / absence of the balmer hydrogen lines .",
    "it is also important to note that many carbon lines are also strongly seen in the optical spectra ( kamath & anupama 2002 ; wagner s site at http://vela.as.arizona.edu/@xmath5rmw /v445pup.html ) at different epochs after the outburst .",
    "in fact in a sample spectrum by m. fujii , bisei observatory , taken soon after the outburst , the strongest optical line that is seen is the cii 6582@xmath33 line ( http://www1.harenet.ne.jp/  aikow/0113pnp.gif ) .",
    "the fujii spectrum also shows the presence of the hei lines",
    ". thus it would be fair to qualitatively say that the ir and optical evidence indicate that not only is v445 puppis a hydrogen - deficient object but also that it is rich in carbon and helium .",

    "however there are cases like v838 her ( chandrasekhar et al . 1992 and references therein ) when dust formed as early as eight days after outburst . in the case of v445 puppis",
    ", we feel that sufficient time after the outburst may have elapsed for dust to form and the dust that is seen here has been created post - outburst .",

    "the assumption that the dust is made of carbon particles may be quite valid in the case of v445 puppis because of the strong presence of carbon in the optical / ir spectra .",

    "the nature of v445 puppis is rather enigmatic . among eruptive variables that show similar outbursts , one may first consider the novae .",
    "v445 puppis differs from a classical novae in the amplitude of it s outburst and also the deficiency of hydrogen in its spectrum .",
    "the strong presence of a large number of carbon lines in the ir spectra is again unusual for a nova .",
    "further , novae are known to evolve with time towards higher temperatures which characterize the nebular and coronal phases .",
    "such behavior is not seen here .",
    "it also does not appear to be a recurrent nova because no earlier outbursts have been recorded or reported for v445 puppis .",
    "in a symbiotic nova , one expects to see high - excitation emission lines in the spectrum during the decline phase - a feature which is absent here ( kenyon 1986 ) .",
    "also , the light curves of symbiotic novae decline much slower than what is observed in v445 puppis .",
    "most importantly , hydrogen - deficiency is not expected in recurrent or symbiotic novae . +",
    "another possibility is that v445 puppis is a born - again agb star .",
    "the nuclei of intermediate mass stars , evolving from the agb stage into planetary nebulae can experience a final helium shell flash which lifts them into a high luminosity range again ( iben et al .",
    "there are only 3 known examples of born - again agb s in the galaxy viz .",
    "v605 aql , fg sge and sakurai s object .",
    "however there are a few arguments against v445 puppis being a born - again agb .",
    "first , no nebulosity ( caused by gas ionized by the hot nuclei ) has been seen around the object as has been found in the other known cases .",
    "we have checked one of the h@xmath65 surveys covering this region ( schwartz 1990 ) but the object is not listed as showing signs of emission .",
    "again , born - again agb s - unlike v445 puppis- brighten very gradually to their peak brightness - a process which can even take decades .",
    "for the actual timescales observed , the reader may refer to duerbeck et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for sakurai s object , harrison ( 1996 ) for v605 aql and fig . 1 of blocker & schonberner ( 1997 ) for fg sge .",
    "+ there is a class of eruptive variables whose spectrum after the outburst evolves into that of a cool m - type giant or supergiant .",
    "this spectral evolution takes place rather rapidly - within a time of 1 to 2 months .",
    "the first such object in this class is a luminous , red variable star ( m31 rv ) that erupted in m31 ( rich et al .",
    "1989 ; mould et al .",
    "subsequently the eruptive variable v4332 sgr ( martini et al .",
    "1999 ) and most recently v838 mon , ( banerjee & ashok 2002a ; munari et al .",
    "2002 ) have been added to this class .",
    "a consensus has not been reached on placing these objects in the same category but what is certain is that after a nova - like outburst they quickly evolve to a very cool m type ( or even later type ) absorption spectrum .",
    "v838 mon has , in fact , evolved at present to be similar to that of a t type brown dwarf ( banerjee & ashok 2002b , geballe et al .",
    "2002 ) . in the case of v445 puppis",
    ", there is vsnet photometric data in the @xmath69 bands for more than 5 months after it s outburst .",
    "we have checked these colors and do not find an evolutionary trend towards m type giant / supergiant stage .",
    "for e.g. on 2001 , march 30.48 ( more than 4 months after the outburst ) the observed magnitudes are @xmath53 = 10.66 and @xmath11 = 10.13 . for an adopted value of e(b - v )",
    "= 0.25 , this results into an intrinsic ( b - v ) color of 0.29 which is very different from @xmath5 1.6 which is the expected value for a cool m giant / supergiant star .",
    "thus v445 puppis does not appear to show an evolutionary trend similar to the v838 mon class of objects .",
    "+ v445 puppis also does not appear to be an rcb or hydrogen deficient carbon star ( hdc ) .",
    "rcb stars show episodic dimming due to ejection of dusty carbon shells , subsequently followed by a rebrightening .",
    "but their spectra are typically f type absorption spectra and most of them are detected in iras and show an ir excess .",
    "v445 puppis was not detected previously by iras .",
    "furthermore , no other outbursts have been recorded for v445 puppis .",
    "hdc stars share most of the properties of rcb stars except that they do not show large brightness variations .",
    "both groups of objects have absolute magnitudes @xmath45 in the range -3 to -5 ( brunner et al .",
    "1998 ) . unless the extinction @xmath39 and distance @xmath37 to v445 puppis are grossly underestimated , @xmath45 @xmath5 0 for v445 puppis .",
    "this is inferred from @xmath44 - @xmath45 = 5log@xmath37 - 5 + @xmath39 using adopted values of @xmath39 @xmath5 1 , an upper limit for @xmath37 = 3 kpc and the pre - outburst magnitude value of @xmath44 = 13.6 .",
    "the object appears under luminous for an rcb star .",
    "+ the possibility that v445 puppis is not a single star - but part of a binary system with an accretion disk - has some supporting evidence .",
    "first , the sed of the star in the pre - outburst stage ( fig . 7 , lower panel ) is difficult to fit with a black body spectrum .",
    "we have tried several black body fits at different temperatures to the observed sed . while fitting , the observed sed has itself been modified by choosing different @xmath38 values in case the adopted value of @xmath38 = 0.25 is grossly incorrect .",
    "however a good fit is not found and the closest fit to the data ( @xmath27 = 6500k , @xmath38 = 0.25 ) is not satisfactory as can be seen from fig .",
    "7 ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is possible that the observed continuum distribution from v445 puppis is dominated by radiation from an accretion disk surrounding the object . in the case of a steady - state accretion disk around a white - dwarf",
    ", the continuum radiation from the disk can be described by an @xmath70 @xmath65 @xmath66 relation ( mayo et al .",
    "1980 and other references therein ) .",
    "a @xmath70 @xmath65 @xmath66 dependence falls off less steeply than the @xmath70 @xmath65 @xmath71 relation expected for a black body in the rayleigh - jeans regime .",
    "we find that such an accretion disk spectrum fits the data of fig .",
    "7 much better than a black body fit . + the radio data from rupen et al .",
    "( 2001a , b and their website http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/  mrupen / xrt / v445pup ) also suggest the possibility of an accretion process in a binary system .",
    "they state that the observed synchrotron emission probably originates either in accretion onto a compact companion or in an asymmetric , clumpy shock at the boundary between ejecta from a fresh outburst in september 2001 and previous ejecta ( the fresh outburst would be obscured by the thick dust shell which had formed around this time ) .",
    "but they argue that the rapid evolution of both the radio emission and the radio absorption - significant flaring is seen in the object - favors the presence of an accretion process .",
    "however , it must be pointed out , there is a lacuna in comparing the observed radio emission with radiation from an accretion disk with a @xmath66 spectra as discussed above .",
    "the latter does not constitute a non - thermal source like the observed radio emission .",
    "but the present radio detection was made well after the outburst .",
    "it may just be possible that the physical conditions / mechanisms of the accretion process are different in the pre- and post - outburst stages leading to a qualitative difference in the radiation emitted .",
    "we are unable to judge on this aspect .",
    "the primary aim of the present work was to look for any evidence - albeit even suggestive - which would show whether v445 puppis belongs to a binary system or not . given the strangeness of the object , this would help understand it s nature .",
    "we feel the recent radio data and the pre - outburst sed seem to indicate a binary nature for v445 puppis .",
    "+ from the arguments given above , we find that it is difficult to place v445 puppis into known categories of eruptive variables .",
    "kato et al . ( 1989 ) and iben & tutukov ( 1994 ) , among other workers , have investigated the case of helium novae .",
    "kato et al . ( 1989 ) consider the case of a degenerate white dwarf accreting helium from its helium rich companion .",
    "for appropriate mass accretion rates , an accretion - induced collapse of the white dwarf into a neutron star need not occur .",
    "instead a thermo - nuclear reaction can occur on the surface of the white dwarf leading to a helium nova outburst .",
    "the ejecta of such an outburst , in the kato et al .",
    "( 1989 ) model , should presumably be rich in helium and carbon and highly hydrogen - deficient .",
    "this is based on the assumed , pre - ignition , chemical composition of the envelope by mass viz @xmath72 = 0 , @xmath73 = 0.97 and @xmath74 = 0.03 .",
    "further , carbon in the ejecta is expected to be additionally enhanced because the thermonuclear outburst process itself converts helium to carbon .",
    "such a scenario , or some close variant of it , may apply to v445 puppis and explain the hydrogen - deficiency ( and he / c enrichment ) of it optical and ir spectra .",
    "the tentative evidence for binarity and accretion disk in v445 puppis is also in conformity with the requirements of a helium nova scenario .",
    "however , the predicted luminosity of the outburst in a helium nova is @xmath16 @xmath5 @xmath75@xmath16@xmath4 ( kato et al .",
    "1989 ) and x - rays are also predicted in the post - outburst stage ( iben & tutukov 1994 ) . in the case of v445 puppis",
    ", there are no reports on x - ray detection from the object , though it is uncertain whether any attempt has been made in this direction .",

    "7 ) , is found to be closer to @xmath76@xmath16@xmath4 i.e. slightly less than the theoretical estimate . in view of this , it may be slightly speculative to identify v445 puppis as a helium nova , but similarities exist . given the interesting and rather unique properties of the object , it is hoped that this work will prompt a rigorous , theoretical study to explain the nature of v445 puppis .",
