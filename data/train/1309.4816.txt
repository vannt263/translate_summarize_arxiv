    "the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ; * ? ? ? * ) is a 30  cm optical / uv telescope mounted on the nasa _ swift _ observatory @xcite .",
    "the uvot is coaligned with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on a rapidly - repointing satellite bus so that the two instruments can observe the afterglows of gamma - ray bursts within two minutes of a gamma - ray burst being detected by the wide - field burst alert telescope ( bat ; * ? ? ?",
    "the uvot is of a modified ritchey chrtien design .",
    "after reflections on the primary and secondary mirrors , the incoming light passes through a hole in the primary to a flat tertiary mirror which directs the light to one of two identical filter wheel and detector chains .",
    "there are seven imaging filters mounted in the uvot filter wheel together with two grisms for low - dispersion spectroscopy .",
    "three optical filters , u , b and v , cover similar wavelength ranges to the johnson ubv set @xcite , and three uv filters , uvw2 , uvm2 and uvw1 , have central wavelengths of 1928 , 2246  and 2600  respectively .",
    "the remaining filter , white , transmits over the full uvot bandpass ( 16008000 ) to maximise throughput .",
    "the uvot detector is a micro - channel plate ( mcp ) intensified charge coupled device ( ccd ) ( mic ; * ? ? ?",
    "individual incident photons liberate electrons in a multi - alkali ( s20 ) photo - cathode , which are multiplied a million - fold using mcps in series .",
    "these electrons strike a phosphor screen , producing photons which are fed to the ccd via a fibre - optic taper .",
    "the resulting cascade of photons arriving on the ccd is centroided on - board to a precision of one eighth of a ccd pixel .",
    "the @xmath0-pixel science area of the ccd thus localises individual incoming photons on a grid of @xmath1 pixels of size @xmath2  arcsec  @xmath3  @xmath2  arcsec with a time resolution equal to the frame time of the ccd ( usually 11.0329 ms ) .",
    "the onboard centroiding produces a low - level modulo-8 fixed - pattern distortion @xcite which is routinely corrected in the ground processing .",
    "data are recorded and transmitted to the ground as an event list , in which the arrival times and positions of individual photons are recorded , or as an image accumulated over a timed exposure . to reduce data volume , images are often binned by a factor of 2 in @xmath4 and @xmath5 before transmission to the ground .",
    "the _ swift _ uvot has an almost - identical optical design and a similar detector system to the _ xmm - newton _ optical monitor ( xmm - om * ? ? ?",
    "the xmm - om differs from the uvot mainly in its uv throughput ( which is lower in xmm - om ) , its control and data processing computers ( which are of an earlier vintage in xmm - om ) and in its operating modes .",
    "the detector response is asymptotically linear when the arrival rate of photons is small compared to the ccd readout frame rate . in normal operation",
    "the uvot has a frame rate of 90.6  s@xmath6 although modes with higher frame rates which read out only a subset of the detector are available . for sources with count rates that are an appreciable fraction of the frame rate",
    ", two or more photons may arrive at a similar location on the detector within the same ccd frame , and are counted as a single photon .",
    "this phenomenon is known as coincidence loss @xcite and is analogous to pile - up in x - ray ccd detectors .",
    "source count rates are routinely corrected for coincidence loss in the uvot tasks in the heasoft _ swift _ ftools software package , and details of the corrections are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the finite number of frames in an exposure implies that the measured count rate follows a binomial ( rather than poisson ) distribution , and as the source count rate approaches the frame rate of the ccd the photometric measurement errors become larger rather than smaller @xcite .",
    "the coincidence - loss correction has been calibrated up to 0.96 detected counts per frame ( before correction for coincidence loss ) in a 5  arcsec radius circular aperture @xcite , corresponding to a corrected count rate of 300  s@xmath6 in full - frame mode , beyond which coincidence loss can no longer be accurately corrected , and this can be taken to define the upper limit to the dynamic range of uvot .",
    "once per ccd frame the charge is transferred vertically to the read - out section .",
    "sources add counts to parts of the image that pass below them on the detector while the charge is being transferred , so that bright sources give rise to vertical lines of enhanced brightness on the image , aligned with the bright sources .",
    "these lines are commonly known as read - out streaks ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] .    in this paper",
    "we describe how the read - out streaks can be used to make photometric measurements with uvot of stars which are too bright to be measured through aperture photometry at the position of the star on the image .",
    "while the calibration obtained and verified in this paper is specific to the uvot , the principles apply equally to the xmm - om .    the paper is laid out as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : instrument ] outlines the basic principles behind photometry using read - out streaks .",
    "the catalogue of objects of known magnitudes which are used to investigate photometry using read - out streaks and the method we adopt to measure them are described in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the results of our investigation are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss these results and develop a method to measure photometry using read - out streaks in any uvot pass - band and window mode in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "a demonstration of the method is provided in the form of early - time photometry of the exceptionally - bright gamma - ray burst grb  080319b .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a step by step description of our recommended procedure to derive photometry from read - out streaks is given in appendix a.",
    "the uvot detector employs an eev ccd-02 - 06 frame - transfer ccd . at the end of the integration period of each ccd frame",
    ", charge is transferred from the imaging area to the frame - store in 290 steps , each taking 600  ns .",
    "the read - out streaks are formed during this 174  @xmath7s interval ; as only 256 of the 290 rows correspond to the science imaging area , the effective exposure time of a complete 256-row readout streak is 153.6  @xmath7s per frame . for comparison , in full - frame operation , the live exposure time ( i.e. excluding the frame transfer time ) per 11.0329  ms frame is 10.8589  ms , so that the complete 256-row read - out streak would be expected to contain 0.01415 times as many counts as the corresponding object in the direct image .",
    "as the exposure is uniform at all points along the readout streak the streak will have uniform brightness in the vertical direction .",
    "the speed at which the image is transferred through the ccd is sufficiently large that coincidence loss should be much less of a problem than in the direct   the count rate of the source in the direct image , implying a @xmath8  mag advantage in the bright limit for photometric measurement with respect to the direct image .",
    "however , coincidence loss arising in a different part of the detector is expected to intervene well before such a large dynamic range is achieved .",
    "charge is stripped from pores of the mcps during the electron amplification , and the timescale for the pores of the mcps in the intensifier to recharge after ejecting electrons is of order 0.3  ms .",
    "this dead - time in the mcp pores following an event may become the limiting factor by giving rise to a second level of coincidence loss , which is independent of the ccd @xcite .",
    "investigation of the read - out streaks for photometry requires the measurement of the read - out streaks of a sufficient sample of stars , covering an appropriate magnitude range , with known magnitudes in a photometric system which can be related systematically to that of the uvot .",
    "we decided to use stars from the tycho-2 catalogue which fall serendipitously within the fields of view of archival full - frame v - band uvot observations . to avoid issues related to image crowding",
    ", we selected observations at galactic latitudes of @xmath9 degrees so as to exclude the galactic plane and magellanic clouds .",
    "the tycho-2 catalogue @xcite contains 2.5 million stars with photometry in two bands from the sky mapper of the esa _ hipparcos _ satellite .",
    "the tycho-2 v@xmath10 passband covers a similar wavelength range to the uvot v band , and in combination with the tycho-2 b@xmath10 magnitudes a suitable transformation to uvot v band photometry can be made ( see section [ sec : transformation ] ) .",
    "the tycho-2 catalogue contains stars with a wide range of magnitudes with reliable photometry down to v@xmath10=12 mag @xcite , which is approximately the limit to which read - out streaks can be easily measured in uvot images .    to avoid problems with the transformation between tycho-2 photometry and uvot v ( see section [ sec : transformation ] ) , we excluded stars of spectral type m from our analysis .",
    "discrimination of m stars from stars of earlier spectral type is poor using tycho-2 b@xmath11v@xmath10 colour , so we cross correlated our sample of tycho-2 stars with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "stars with v@xmath11j@xmath12 are likely to be m stars and were excluded from our sample .",
    "after these stars were excluded , we measured the read - out streaks for a total of 160 stars .      .",
    "bottom panel : the mean pixel brightness in each column of the masked image .",
    "the grey line shows the 128-column median which is used for background estimation .",
    "the read - out streaks from the 3 brightest stars are significantly detected .",
    "the apertures used to measure the brightness of the streaks are shown below them , and labelled with the signal to noise ratios .",
    ", width=317 ]    read - out streaks are precisely vertical in raw uvot images , but this is not the case after images have been corrected for distortion ( primarily from the fibre taper connecting the phosphor screen to the ccd ) and rotated so that x and y coordinates correspond to equatorial coordinate axes . therefore read - out streaks are best measured from the raw uvot images , after correction for modulo-8 noise , but before the distortion corrections . in practice the read - out streak can never be measured over the full vertical extent of the image because the direct image of the star responsible for the read - out streak , and any other stars which are located in the same column , will be superimposed on it .",
    "therefore the brightness of the streak must be measured from parts of the streak which are not contaminated by objects in the image .",
    "the brightness of the read - out streaks was measured according to the following procedure .",
    "note that in the description that follows , the terms pixel , rows and columns refer to unbinned uvot image pixels , rows and columns of image pixels respectively .",
    "first , bright sources with count rates exceeding 40 count  s@xmath6 were identified in the image and masked with circular regions of radius 24  arcsec .",
    "this separate step is needed for bright stars because they are surrounded by dark regions which result from coincidence loss , which would not be identified in a regular source searching process .",
    "next , each column of the image was searched for enhanced - brightness pixels corresponding to sources in two steps .",
    "first , individual pixels exceeding the median pixel value of the column by more than 3@xmath13 , or by more than 3 counts if the median of the column is @xmath14 , are flagged . in the second step ,",
    "the column is smoothed with a 10-pixel boxcar filter to improve sensitivity to faint sources before again flagging pixels which exceed the median of the column by more than 3@xmath13 , or by more than 3 counts if the median of the column is @xmath14 .",
    "pixels flagged in either step are then masked from the column .",
    "the rationale for performing this operation column by column rather than simply source - searching the image is that it prevents the read - out streaks themselves from being erroneously identified as sources .",
    "next , the columns are collapsed to a single row containing , for each column , the mean value of all non - masked pixels in the column . read - out streaks are then identified using a 16-column sliding box along the row , at a 6-sigma threshold with respect to the median counts measured in a 128-column sliding box .",
    "the count rate in the 16-pixel aperture is then background - subtracted using the 128-column median , and scaled to a 16-row section of the image ( i.e. multiplied by a factor of 16 assuming an unbinned image ) .",
    "the scaling in this stage is arbitrary , but @xmath15  pixels  @xmath3  @xmath15  pixels is a convenient equivalent - aperture in which to measure the count rate of the read - out streak because it has a similar sky area to the 5  arcsec radius circular aperture normally used for photometry of point sources in uvot images , as well as corresponding to precisely @xmath16 ccd pixels ( which are subsampled by a factor of 8 in the event centroiding process , as described in section [ sec : introduction ] ) .",
    "the size of the 128-pixel sliding box used for background is chosen as a compromise between tracing the variation in background over the image ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic ] ) and minimising the contribution of the background estimation to the statistical uncertainty of the read - out streak measurement .",
    "finally , the count rate of the read - out streak is corrected for the large - scale sensitivity variations ( evaluated at the position of the star in the image ) and time - dependent sensitivity degradation of the uvot @xcite .",
    "( dashed line ) and johnson v ( dotted line ) passbands.,width=241 ]    responsivity curves for the uvot v band , johnson v band , and tycho-2 v@xmath10 band are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filters ] .",
    "while all three cover approximately the same wavelength range , there are significant differences in the shapes of the curves , so that translation between the different photometric systems is colour - dependent . to derive a transformation between tycho-2 v@xmath10 and uvot v magnitudes , we generated synthetic b@xmath11v@xmath10 and v@xmath17v@xmath10 colours for the stars of the @xcite spectral library .",
    "[ fig : transform ] shows the resulting colour - colour distribution for spectral types k and earlier . for stars with b@xmath11v@xmath18 there is a tight linear relation between b@xmath11v@xmath10 and v@xmath17v@xmath10 . from a least - squares fit to the data points with b@xmath11v@xmath18 ( shown as a grey line in fig .",

    "the rms scatter of the datapoints about this relation is 0.006 mag for b@xmath11v@xmath18 .",
    "stars with b@xmath11v@xmath20 deviate from this linear relation , but this is not of concern because all of the tycho-2 stars used in our read - out streak analysis have b@xmath11v@xmath21 .",
    "stars of spectral type m were not used to derive the colour transformation because they show a much larger scatter in the b@xmath11v@xmath10 and v@xmath17v@xmath10 relation than stars of earlier spectral type ; a similar problem besets the transformation of tycho-2 magnitudes to johnson v @xcite .     magnitudes as a function of tycho-2 b@xmath22v@xmath10 colour .",

    "[ fig : vrate ] shows the relation between v magnitude derived from tycho-2 and the count rate of the read - out strip in a @xmath15  pixel  @xmath3  @xmath15  pixel aperture for the sample of tycho-2 stars observed in full - frame uvot v - band images . as described in section  [ sec : instrument ] , the fixed ratio of exposure time in the read - out streak and the static image implies that the readout streak will receive 0.01415 times as many counts as the direct image .",
    "this ratio must be divided by a factor of 128 to scale to a 16 pixel section of the readout streak ( corresponding to our @xmath15  pixel  @xmath3  @xmath15  pixel aperture ) , so that the zeropoint appropriate to convert read - out - streak count rate to magnitude in such an aperture will be 9.89 magnitudes brighter than the corresponding zeropoint used for aperture photometry of the static image ; for the v band of uvot this implies a zeropoint of 8.00 for photometry using the read - out streak .",
    "the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : vrate ] shows the count - rate to magnitude relation predicted from this zeropoint .",
    "while the measured count - rates are clustered around the predicted relation at the faintest magnitudes ( v@xmath24 ) , they are systematically below it at brighter magnitudes . for v@xmath25",
    "the count - rates show a large scatter and show little correlation with the magnitude of the source . as described in section  [ sec : instrument ] , these magnitudes are not bright enough for the diminished count - rates to be due to coincidence loss on the ccd during frame transfer .",
    "a more likely culprit is the coincidence loss of photons which arrive while the mcp pores are recharging , predicted by @xcite . as this coincidence loss arises in the mcps rather than the ccd",
    ", it is independent of the ccd frame time",
    ". we can assume that by the third in - series mcp in the intensifier , the area of the mcp which is utilised in the detection of incoming photons from a point source is large enough that the process can be treated as coincidence loss in a single - pixel detector .",
    "starting from equation 4 of @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean number of counts observed per frame ( i.e. after coincidence loss ) and @xmath28 is the mean number of incoming counts per frame ( i.e. before coincidence loss ) . in this case",
    "a frame is the timescale required for the mcp to recharge , which we will call @xmath29 , and all counts from the source contribute to coincidence loss , not just those which arrive during the formation of the readout streak .",
    "if the ratio of the integration time of the static image to the frame - transfer time is @xmath30 , the count rate of a source in the static image will be @xmath30 times the count rate that will be measured in a 16  pixel section of the read - out streak .",
    "hence the numbers of counts per frame are related to the count rates before and after correction for coincidence loss as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , where @xmath33 is the incoming count rate in a @xmath15  pixel  @xmath3  @xmath15  pixel section of the read - out streak before coincidence loss and @xmath34 is the observed count - rate with coincidence loss . substituting and rearranging ,",
