    "<S> irradiating a ferromagnetic material with an ultrashort laser pulse leads to demagnetization on a femtosecond timescale . </S>",
    "<S> we implement elliott - yafet type spin - flip scattering , mediated by electron - electron and electron - phonon collisions , into the framework of a spin - resolved boltzmann equation . considering three mutually coupled reservoirs , ( i ) spin - up electrons , ( ii ) spin - down electrons and ( iii ) phonons , we trace non - equilibrium electron distributions during and after laser excitation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the driving force for ultrafast magnetization dynamics as the equilibration of temperatures and chemical potentials between the electronic subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> this principle can be used to easily predict the maximum quenching of magnetization upon ultrashort laser irradiation in any material , as we show for the example of -ferromagnetic nickel .    </S>",
    "<S> interaction of a femtosecond laser pulse with ferromagnetic metal is known for more than a decade to cause ultrafast quenching of the magnetization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical demagnetization times extracted from experiments on the 3d - ferromagnetic metals co , fe and ni are between 100fs and 300fs , depending on the laser fluence and the specific sample @xcite . from the theoretical side , </S>",
    "<S> intense efforts are being undertaken in order to identify the microscopic mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior @xcite . among the considered mechanisms , </S>",
    "<S> elliott - yafet ( ey)-type spin - flip scattering @xcite is definitely one of the most implemented for the modeling of ultrafast demagnetization . </S>",
    "<S> the most popular ey - type spin - flip mechanism is electron - phonon ( el - ph ) scattering @xcite , while recently electron - electron ( el - el ) coulomb scattering has been considered as well @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on ey - type el - ph scattering , koopmans et al.developed the so - called microscopic three - temperature model ( m3tm ) , which has been shown to possess a great predictive power , explaining not only the demagnetization in ferromagnetic transition metals but also the specific demagnetization characteristics of gadolinium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> electron - electron coulomb scattering has been implemented in a dynamical model including momentum- and spin - dependent carrier scattering @xcite , in the following referred to as the coulomb ( eec ) model . since the band structure </S>",
    "<S> is taken as input for the calculations , the eec model can be successfully applied to understand the demagnetization dynamics in materials with peculiar band structure , as recently shown for the case of half - metallic heusler alloys @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , a fundamental question remains still unsolved : what is the ultimate `` driving force '' for ultrafast demagnetization ?    to answer this question , we introduce a simplified , yet microscopic kinetic model , describing non - equilibrium electron dynamics in laser - excited ferromagnetic metals . </S>",
    "<S> it combines the basic ingredients of the m3tm and the eec model in the framework of a _ spin - resolved boltzmann equation_. the main idea behind this approach is schematically depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic:3tm ] . based on the eec model </S>",
    "<S> , we describe a ferromagnetic metal as consisting of three subsystems : the spin - up ( majority ) electrons , the spin - down ( minority ) electrons , and the phonon system . </S>",
    "<S> we consider el - el spin - flips and additionally , in the spirit of the m3tm , we include el - ph mediated spin - flips but without the need of introducing a separate spin subsystem . in order to enable the implementation of complete boltzmann collision integrals and to ensure a clear interpretation of the results </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to make simplifying assumptions , like the free electron gas density of states ( dos ) for the two spin subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of our approach is that it allows to assign a respective temperature and chemical potential to up and down electrons , denoted by @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the equilibration of these quantities is the driving force of ultrafast demagnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this equilibration condition can be easily applied to real materials with complex dos to obtain the maximum magnetization quenching following laser excitation , as we exemplarily show for nickel . as a further result </S>",
    "<S> , our approach is capable to clarify the relative role played by el - el and el - ph scattering during ultrafast demagnetization .    in our model </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the time- and energy dependent dynamics of the considered subsystems on the basis of a kinetic approach applying complete boltzmann collision integrals  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between electrons ( el - el ) , electrons and phonons ( el - ph ) as well as the absorption of laser energy ( absorp ) are described as independent collision integrals @xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their sum yields the transient evolutions of the electronic distribution @xmath3 and the phononic distribution @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the particular collision integrals are generally derived by fermi s golden rule @xmath5 where @xmath6 indicates the hamiltonian for the considered collision process , @xmath7 the initial state with energy @xmath8 and @xmath9 the final state with energy @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> such model was developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite to describe non - equilibrium electron and phonon dynamics during and after ultrafast laser excitation for a non - magnetic material . </S>",
    "<S> it is capable to account for non - equilibrium distribution functions where no real temperatures are defined .    </S>",
    "<S> first , to apply this approach to ferromagnetic metals we include the stoner model into the existing theory . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a separated description of the two spin systems ( up and down electrons ) , with a constant energy shift by the exchange energy @xmath11 between the corresponding distribution functions .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we include spin - mixing in our approach . </S>",
    "<S> this allows a coupling between both electronic reservoirs : typically , the orthogonality of the up and down states guarantees that the matrix element @xmath12 vanishes and for a spin diagonal interaction operator , there will be no possibility for an electron to change its spin during a collision process . but due to the spin orbit coupling in solids , no pure up or down states are defined , but a mixture of both  @xcite . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> an up - electron , for instance , is described by the state @xmath13 whereby @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> as the matrix element of the mixed state is larger than zero @xmath15 , the spin orbit coupling allows for spin - flip and thus induces an interaction between the two spin systems in our model . </S>",
    "<S> the collisions including the spin - mixing are thus described by @xmath16 whereby @xmath17 is the spatial and @xmath18 the ( mixed ) spin wave function of the electron .    with all the described ingredients , </S>",
    "<S> we can now write down the _ spin - resolved boltzmann equation _    [ eq : sdbeq ] @xmath19    with @xmath20 indicating the spin states . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sdbeq ] ) consists of three equations for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the collision terms @xmath2 can be found in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> each of the distinct equations is coupled to both others , thus the dynamics of all three subsystems mutually depend on each other . </S>",
    "<S> since the description allows for spin - flips , the number of particles in each electronic reservoir is not conserved . instead </S>",
    "<S> , the _ sum _ of the transient number of particles of spin - up ( @xmath24 ) and spin - down ( @xmath25 ) is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> the transient magnetization @xmath26 is calculated through @xmath27 whereby @xmath28 is the bohr magneton .    </S>",
    "<S> we solve the spin - resolved boltzmann equation   for a prototype of a ferromagnetic material with the fermi energy , the effective mass @xmath29 and the density of states of a free electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> we assume the exchange energy @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - mixing parameter @xmath31 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : spinmixing ] ) is chosen according to ab initio calculations for ni  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the phononic system we apply the debye model with @xmath32 as debye temperature . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters represent typical values for real metals . </S>",
    "<S> note that none of them is used as a fit parameter , because it is not in the scope of this article to reproduce the experimental data , but to identify the driving force of ultrafast demagnetization . </S>",
    "<S> in this spirit we chose the density of states of a free electron gas because essential relations are given analytically and the solution of the spin - resolved boltzmann equation can thus be easily interpreted . </S>",
    "<S> finally , to clearly investigate the processes after optical excitation , we assume a rectangular laser profile in time . in order to solve the spin - resolved boltzmann equation   </S>",
    "<S> we compute a system of approximately 300 strongly coupled integro - differential equations . </S>",
    "<S> the solution provides the transient non - equilibrium distribution function of each electronic reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> it resembles the evolution of the electron distribution in fig .  1 of ref </S>",
    "<S> .  @xcite , but extended by the information on the two spin reservoirs . in particular , a net spin - flip is observed as a slight particle exchange between both electron reservoirs in the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sdbeq ] ) during and after irradiation . figures [ pic : nophonon ] and [ pic : flips ] were calculated for a 100  fs laser pulse with wavelength @xmath33 and a total absorbed fluence of @xmath34 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic : flips ] , which will be discussed later in detail , curve ( a ) shows the transient magnetization ( normalized to the initial magnetization ) obtained with the spin - resolved boltzmann equation   and applying eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a demagnetization time of after laser irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> remagnetization occurs on a picosecond timescale .    </S>",
    "<S> generally , when a system is excited out of its equilibrium state , it tends back to a new equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> an example is the relaxation between electrons and phonons after ultrafast laser excitation . here , </S>",
    "<S> the initially heated electrons transfer energy to the lattice in a way that both end at a new , higher temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the nonequilibrium of temperatures between both systems drives this energy exchange . </S>",
    "<S> however , what is the driving force of particle exchange between spin - up and spin - down electrons , which , according to eq .  , is the basis for magnetization dynamics ? </S>",
    "<S> for such a system , allowing for energy _ and _ particle exchange , the equilibrium condition refers to temperature _ and _ chemical potential and reads @xmath35 exploiting the simplifications possible for a free electron gas , the chemical potentials can be explicitly expressed by the sommerfeld expansion : @xmath36 \\enspace.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after optical excitation , the temperatures @xmath37 and @xmath38 will be increased . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that @xmath37 and @xmath38 were already equalized . then eq .   </S>",
    "<S> clarifies that in order to equal also the chemical potentials @xmath39 and @xmath40 , a change of @xmath41 , mediated by a change of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , is required . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is the equilibration of chemical potentials of the two electronic subsystems , which leads to a particle exchange between both reservoirs and thus provides the ultimate driving force for ultrafast magnetization dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : nophonons ] our model allows to verify the conclusion of the driving force behind the demagnetization process because we can selectively suppress different scattering channels in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : sdbeq ] ) . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we discard the phononic influence by setting @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the transient spin - resolved density @xmath45 and internal energy @xmath46 are depicted in dependence on time in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic : nophonon](a ) together with the difference @xmath47 , being proportional to the magnetization . due to the higher electron density of majority electrons </S>",
    "<S> the amount of energy absorbed by the spin - up electrons is larger than for the spin - down electrons . for each moment in time and </S>",
    "<S> both spin directions we may define a temperature @xmath0 and a chemical potential @xmath1 of the current distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities are found through the implicit integral equations of the corresponding fermi distribution @xmath48 :    [ eqs : implicit ] @xmath49    the resulting temperatures @xmath0 and chemical potentials @xmath1 are depicted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic : nophonon](b ) . due to laser excitation , </S>",
    "<S> both temperatures increase , while the chemical potentials drop . when the laser is turned off ( at @xmath50 ) the two spin systems differ in temperatures _ and _ chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> since this difference is small for the assumed case of free electron like density of states ( second order term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ taylor ] ) ) , the quenching of magnetization is also considerably lower than observed in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , the reservoirs equilibrate until a same temperature @xmath51 _ and _ chemical potential @xmath52 are reached . according to eq .   </S>",
    "<S> constraints have to be satisfied to reach an equilibrium between the electronic systems . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic : nophonon](b ) verifies that the temperatures and chemical potentials equilibrate simultaneously . comparing with fig .  [ pic : nophonon](a ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find that also the transient magnetization , being proportional to @xmath47 , reaches its asymptotical value on the same timescale . in its essence </S>",
    "<S> , the particle exchange affected by the difference in chemical potentials provides the driving force for ultrafast magnetization .    in order to estimate the effect for more realistic systems , </S>",
    "<S> we choose nickel and solve the equilibrium condition applying the implicit equations with the real density of states for ni @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that this can be done without explicitly solving the spin - resolved boltzmann equation . in case of starting at room temperature and ending up at an electron temperature of @xmath53 a maximum quenching of @xmath54 is found . </S>",
    "<S> such transient electron temperatures are typical for ultrafast laser excitation of metals below melting threshold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , applying the main result of our simplified model to realistic systems leads to quantitative agreement with experiments , demonstrating the solidity of our findings .    to show the great potential of the spin - resolved boltzmann equation </S>",
    "<S> , we now exemplarily compare the relative effects of el - el spin - flips and el - ph spin - flips on the demagnetization process . </S>",
    "<S> we again restrict ourselves to the case of a free electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ pic : flips ] represents the calculated magnetization dynamics obtained with the spin - resolved boltzmann equation , when different collision processes are regarded separately . </S>",
    "<S> the red solid line ( d ) corresponds to the red solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic : nophonon](a ) , determining the magnetization dynamics when the influence of the phonon bath is completely discarded . </S>",
    "<S> including the cooling by phonons but disregarding el - ph spin - flips ( green dotted line ( c ) ) , we see a slight recovery of magnetization .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , phonon cooling is essential for the _ _ re__magnetization process . </S>",
    "<S> however , phonons also strengthen the magnetization dynamics : if we additionally allow for phonon mediated spin - flips we find the black dash - dotted curve ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the demagnetization occurs faster than in the case where only electron collisions mediate spin - flips , while the remagnetization is strongly accelerated by phonon mediated spin - flips . </S>",
    "<S> hence , phonons can act like a catalyst for the ultrafast magnetization process . the blue dashed line ( b ) </S>",
    "<S> is calculated excluding electron - electron - collision mediated spin - flips . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the quenching of magnetization will be less . comparing the simulations shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ pic : flips ] we conclude that for our system electron mediated spin - flips are important mainly during the _ de_magnetization phase , while phonon mediated spin - flips dominate the </S>",
    "<S> _ re_magnetization phase and increase the effectiveness of the demagnetization .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we described the ultrafast demagnetization with the spin - resolved boltzmann equation . </S>",
    "<S> we identified the driving force of the demagnetization process in the equilibration of the temperatures _ and _ chemical potentials of the up and down electrons . </S>",
    "<S> as shown for the example of ni this equilibrium condition provides a possibility to easily estimate the maximum quenching for any ferromagnetic material . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is also capable to investigate the role of different scattering processes during ultrafast demagnetization dynamics . </S>"
