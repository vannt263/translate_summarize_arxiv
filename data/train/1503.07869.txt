    "in addition , there is a systematic change in timescales , with all of the contaminants ( except for the aic events ) shifting to a rise time of @xmath127 d by _ z _ @xmath11 0.6 due to time dilation .",
    "the inherent low luminosity of most fast transients means that they quickly drop below the sensitivity limit of a reasonable search ( e.g. , @xmath128 ab mag ) .",
    "only the type ia sne , pan - starrs fast transients , and the most luminous type .ia models are brighter than @xmath20 23 ab mag by _ z _ @xmath11 0.2 , and by _ z _ @xmath11 0.6 only the transient ps1 - 11qr and type ia sne will still be detectable .",
    "quantitatively , we can impose cuts of @xmath129 d , @xmath130 mag , and @xmath131 mag to isolate kilonovae from contaminants . for sources at @xmath132 , this will isolate kilonovae from all contaminants except the pan - starrs fast transient ps1 - 10ah .",
    "these cuts remain effective for more distant sources as well .",
    "for example , at @xmath133 , aic , the @xmath85 type .ia sne , and ps1 - 10ah all exhibit @xmath129 d and @xmath130 mag .",
    "however , they no longer pass the brightness cut , with @xmath134 mag .",
    "therefore , we conclude that given well - sampled light curves , we can use the rise time - color - brightness phase - space to separate kilonovae from the contaminant population of other rapidly evolving sources .",
    "the analysis in the previous section was based on the idea that it is possible to obtain well - sampled light curves of kilonovae and other fast transients , but in reality the search cadence for a large area and the required depth will lead to at most a few light curve points . to explore the impact of realistic observations we utilize monte carlo ( mc ) simulations which model a set of gw follow - up observations parameterized by cadence , limiting magnitude , and start time following a gw trigger .",

    "for example , the event occurs in a region previously observed to a similar or greater depth by the wide - field telescope being used for the follow - up .",
    "template images are obtained after the source has faded .",
    "for kilonovae follow - up , this requires observations at @xmath135 days after the gw trigger .",
    "the first observation taken as part of a gw follow - up campaign is used as the template image .    from an analysis standpoint ,",
    "the first two scenarios are identical as both involve a template image which contains no flux from the transient source .",
    "this allows robust subtractions to be performed , as well as precise measurements of brightness and color .",
    "however , the second scenario does not allow for the real - time identification of the transient , which is critical for obtaining follow - up spectroscopy and nir imaging .",
    "these scenarios are the primary focus of this section .",
    "the third scenario , using the first observation as a template , is more challenging .",
    "the potential for the presence of flux from the transient in the template image means that we can only measure a relative difference in brightness .",
    "when this difference is small compared to the noise in the image it becomes difficult to measure key quantities such as color or even claim that the source has been detected in difference imaging .",
    "we note that the second and third scenarios are not mutually exclusive .",

    "furthermore , while sources in @xmath3-band are only observed to decline , in @xmath69- and @xmath70-band the rise can also be measured without requiring a @xmath113 hr baseline .",
    "this further highlights the importance of having observations that are sufficiently separated in time to probe the kilonova light curve across a wide range of its evolution .    the rapid decline of @xmath166 mag in _",
    "r_-band that is evident in figures  [ fig : delm2 ] and  [ fig : delm3 ] hints at a possible detection strategy .",

    "however , a depth of @xmath2026 mag is required for a high detection fraction even if we require only 2 detections ( to separate kilonovae from stellar flares ) , so covering the large gw error region can only be achieved with lsst .",
    "these detectability simulations indicate that using intra - night observations ( strategies 3 and 4 ) to detect the rise of the light curve is not an efficient use of time for follow - up observations since kilonovae generally do not exhibit a statistically significant change in brightness on this timescale .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : det ] , the choice of cadence does not drastically impact the likelihood of detection .",

    "we now use our simulated observations to explore the contaminant population in the framework of the rise time - color - magnitude phase - space outlined in section  [ sec : phase ] .",

    "( 2 ) the contaminant light curve is randomly placed out of phase with respect to the start time of observations .",
    "we consider contaminants that occur approximately twice their characteristic timescale prior ( 520 days ) and up to 2 days after the start of observations .",
    "the latter value is motivated by the results of the previous section in which we showed that kilonovae should be detectable within 12 days , and therefore , sources that first appear more than 2 days after the start of the observations can be rejected .",

    "[ fig : mcphasecol ] we plot the rise time - color slice of the three - dimensional phase - space for each observing strategy .",
    "in addition to the nine kilonovae models , we consider four groups of sources with each given an equal contribution .",

    "we first bin sources by their rise times , which fall in discrete values due to the cadence of the observations . for each rise time bin",
    ", we then bin the source populations by @xmath169 color in equally spaced bins from 1.5 to + 1.5 mag .",
    "for each bin , we compute the fraction of detected sources in that bin relative to the total number of detected sources .    as we showed in section  [ sec : phase ] , kilonovae stand out from the contaminant population primarily on the basis of their redder colors , even when luminous contaminants are considered to higher redshifts ( e.g. , type ia sne , pan - starrs fast transients ) . for all choices of observing strategy",
    "there is essentially no overlap in @xmath169 color between the kilonova population and any of the contaminant populations .",

    "these numbers are relative to the total number of events observed during the rise and do not include sources that are observed only in decline ( see below ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath169 color remains a strong discriminant for separating kilonovae from the contaminant population .",
    "so far we have neglected the potential effect of extinction in reddening the @xmath169 colors of the contaminant sources .",
    "if the extinction is sufficiently large an intrinsically blue contaminant may be reddened into the regime of kilonova @xmath169 colors .",
    "however , this extinction will also cause the source to appear dimmer and may therefore push it below the detection limit . to quantify the effects of extinction we use the milky way extinction curve with @xmath174 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mcphasecol ] indicates that a reddening of @xmath175 mag is required to shift the contaminant population into the region of phase - space occupied by kilonovae .",
    "this will result in an extinction of @xmath176 mag , @xmath177 mag and @xmath178 mag .",
    "however , in our simulation nearly all ( @xmath179 ) of the contaminants which pass the detection cuts have @xmath180 mag meaning that an extinction of 2.9 mag will dim these sources below our _ z_-band detection limit of @xmath20 23 mag . thus",
    ", reddening due to dust extinction does not seem to be a concern .",
    "we also consider the possibility of separating kilonovae by their rise time . in figure",
    "[ fig : phase ] , the entire set of kilonovae models showed generally shorter timescales relative to the contaminant population with rise times of @xmath181 days .",
    "however , when the contaminants are placed out of phase with the gw trigger , and the observing cadence is taken into account , we find contaminants that present an apparent shorter rise time .",
    "this effect is the most prominent in the pan - starrs fast transients and miscellaneous fast transients for which @xmath182 and @xmath183 of detected sources show a rise time of @xmath90 4 days , respectively .",
    "we also find that @xmath184 of detected type .ia show a rise time that is @xmath90 4 days .",
    "lastly , for type ia sne , @xmath185 of detected sources will present a rise time of @xmath90 4 days .",
    "thus , rise time alone is not a strong discriminant for separating kilonovae from the contaminant population .        in section  [ sec :",
    "phase ] , we considered the peak _ z_-band magnitude as the third data point in our phase - space .",
    "however , in a magnitude limited search , the population of contaminants will be dominated by events at the furthest distance to which they can be detected .",
    "here we instead track the evolution of the source brightness by computing the difference in _",
    "z_-band magnitude between the source at the observed peak ( @xmath186 ) and the first observation in which it is detected ( @xmath187 ) , denoted as @xmath188 .",

    "the basic layout of the figure is identical to that of figure  [ fig : mcphasecol ] , but sources are offset by @xmath1905 hours to improve visibility .",
    "we find that kilonovae exhibit @xmath191 mag , where larger changes in brightness are associated with longer rise times .",
    "type ia sne only exhibit values of @xmath189 comparable to those of kilonova when the observed rise time is @xmath192 d ( the duration of our search ) , well beyond the range of observed rise times for kilonovae . when the rise time is @xmath193 d ,",
    "the average change in brightness is negligible ( @xmath194 mag ) .",
    "this is because shorter rise times only occur near peak when the light curve evolution is slow .",
    "this slow evolution will make type ia sne easy to reject relative to the much more rapidly evolving kilonovae .",
    "we note a small fraction of events with @xmath195 mag and rise times of @xmath196 days .",
    "these account for @xmath197 of detected type ia sne and are the result of an event occurring in a range of redshifts where the set of spectral features that produce the second peak of type ia sne appear in _ z_-band . thus , type ia sne can be rejected based on @xmath189 , rise time , and @xmath169 color . for the other contaminant populations the separation is not as clean .",
    "this is not unexpected since rapid evolution was a strong consideration when constructing our list of potential contaminants .",
    "this highlights the critical importance of selecting kilonovae on the basis of their @xmath169 color along with their rapid rise times .",
    "we demonstrated in figure  [ fig : rise ] that it is challenging to detect a kilonova during the rise to peak .",
    "therefore , in our simulations we also consider the behavior of sources that are observed in decline .",

    "furthermore , the fraction of contaminants seen in decline that exhibit @xmath199 is essentially unchanged compared to those observed on the rise . additionally ,",
    "all of the contaminants considered still exhibit @xmath200 mag , so therefore color can still be utilized as a strong discriminant .",
    "the efficacy of a cut on decline time is diminished compared to a cut on rise time .",

    "a notable exception is type ia sne , which all exhibit a decline time of @xmath192 days ( the duration of the search ) , because if the source is already in decline at the start of the observations , it will remain detectable for the entire duration of the search .",
    "only @xmath185 of kilonovae exhibit a decline time of @xmath193 days , making this an ineffectual cut . on the other hand ,",
    "the slow evolution is beneficial for separating the type ia sne population from a kilonova if template images at @xmath202 days are utilized . in this scenario ,",
    "the kilonova will have faded away while type ia sne will remain visible allowing them to be easily rejected .",

    "we define @xmath203 , where @xmath204 is the _",
    "z_-band magnitude from the last observation in which the source is detected .",
    "kilonovae exhibit a change in brightness of @xmath205 mag , with a weak trend for larger changes in brightness being associated with longer observed decline times .",
    "the type ia sne and pan - starrs fast transients exhibit an average change in brightness of only @xmath206 mag and @xmath207 mag , respectively , making the potential for contamination low .",
    "however , as with the rise time-@xmath189 space , the type .ia and miscellaneous fast transients exhibit changes in brightness that are comparable to those of kilonovae .",
    "this makes cuts on @xmath189 less practical for these sources .",
    "the key point emerging from our simulations is that @xmath169 color is a strong discriminant for selecting kilonovae , regardless of observing strategy , and whether a kilonova is observed on the rise or decline .",
    "in fact , if we consider sources observed during the rise to peak , and we require that @xmath199 mag we may eliminate @xmath208 of detected type ia sne and pan - starrs fast transients , @xmath209 of detected type .ia , and @xmath210 of detected miscellaneous fast transients without removing any kilonovae from the selection .",

    "if we also require that @xmath213 mag , we eliminate @xmath214 of type ia sne .",
    "considering sources observed in decline the cuts on @xmath169 color and @xmath189 remain effective but a cut on decline time does not provide any additional information .",

    "but , given that cuts made on sources observed to rise are more effective , then in order to maximize the chances of a kilonova detection and identification during a gw follow - up campaign it is essential to obtain both _",

    "we now investigate the situation where there are no pre - existing template images of the gw error region and we would like to rapidly identify a kilonovae without having to wait for a late - time template .",
    "this scenario introduces several challenges .",
    "foremost is the presence of source flux in the image that will be used as a template , which will have an effect on the observables ( e.g. , brightness , color ) .",
    "specifically , we can no longer measure the true flux of the source but rather only the difference in flux between the science and template images . in this case",
    ", a measurement of the true magnitude of the source is impossible . without the accurate measurement of source brightness",
    "it is also difficult to measure the true color and we therefore lose one of the primary methods of distinguishing kilonovae from the contaminant population . as discussed in detail below , these difficulties can be alleviated by making simple assumptions about the source behavior .",
    "another obvious challenge is a delay in the timescale of the first science image since the first observation must be used as the template image .",
    "this is leads to problems in characterizing the early behavior of the light curve , as well as in utilizing the rise time as a method of distinguishing kilonvoae from the contaminant population .",
    "using the first observation as a template also reduces the number of available epochs making it more difficult to meet the detection criteria outlined in the previous section .",
    "however , these challenges are less severe as they can resolved using a late - time template once potential counterparts are identified .    to address the scenario of using the first image as a template , and to gauge the associated complications , we simulate observations using the same methodology outlined in section  [ sec : mcsims_det ] , but taking into account the fact that the first observation is the template . the general procedure is identical to the previous simulations with the following modifications",
    ": we now simulate the effects of difference imaging by subtracting the flux in the first observation ( the template ) from the later observations ( the science images ) to produce a set of difference fluxes .",
    "we account for the noise appropriately by using our search depth as a @xmath136 flux limit .",
    "we assume that this noise is the dominant source of error and that it is the same for all images .",
    "the noise in the difference image is then larger by a factor of @xmath221 than that of the individual images .",
    "any source that shows a change in flux with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) greater than 5 in the difference image in at least two subtractions is flagged as a detection .",
    "if a source exhibits at least one epoch with a positive change in flux , the event is flagged as  rising . \"        in figure  [ fig : detdiff ] , we plot contours of the fraction of sources that pass our detection criterion as a function of start time and search depth .",
    "the layout of this plot is identical to that of figure  [ fig : det ] .",
    "we first note that the _ r_-band contours for strategies 1 and 2 are essentially identical to those in figure  [ fig : det ] .",
    "this is because the @xmath3-band light curve evolves fast enough between observations that the effects of using the first observation as a template does not hamper detections . however , for strategies 3 and 4 , we no longer find the early - time ( @xmath193 hours ) boost in detection limit .",
    "this is due to the fact that the light curve does not change sufficiently during the three hours , and the source is therefore not detected in the first difference image .",
    "there is therefore no benefit from the additional observation on the first night . on the other hand , in _",
    "i_-band we find that on average the depth required to reach a certain detection rate is @xmath9 mag deeper than in the case of a pre - existing or late - time template ( figure  [ fig : det ] ) .",

    "the 95% contour is flat at @xmath142 mag in both cases .",
    "strategy 3 is identical to strategy 1 , again highlighting the fact that the rapid cadence on the first night does not boost the detection rate .",
    "lastly , we find that the rapid early - time cadence combined with the slow late - time cadence of strategy 4 actually produces a drop in efficiency for observations beginning at @xmath11 3 hours where the 95% contour dips to @xmath227 mag",
    ".        the most pronounced change relative to the case of a pre - existing template ( figure  [ fig : det ] ) can be seen in the _",
    "z_-band contours . in strategy 1 , the 50% ( 95% ) contour is approximately @xmath228 mag , which is again @xmath9 mag deeper than for the case of a pre - existing template .",
    "strategy 2 shows a change of behavior in the 95% contour between 6 and 12 hours , where the required depth dips to @xmath229 mag .",
    "this is because observations starting during this time frame will be roughly symmetrical about the peak of the light curve .",
    "therefore , the change in flux is small and the source will not be detected in the difference image .",
    "the slow cadence of strategy 2 then makes it difficult to obtain enough observations to reach our threshold for a detection .",
    "this effect is also seen in strategy 4 where the 95% contour dips to @xmath229 mag for any starting time less than 12 hours .",
    "these contours are summarized in table  [ tab : det ] .    in figure",
    "[ fig : risediff ] , we show contours for the fraction of sources with a detected brightening between the template and at least one of the science images .",
    "these sources must also pass the detection criterion described above .",
    "the layout is identical to that of figure  [ fig : rise ] .",
    "the behavior of the contours is different compared to the case of a pre - existing template for all bandpasses and strategies . in figure  [ fig : rise ] , the contours were flat and then exhibited a sharp drop off when the first observation began post peak . here ,",
    "the contours show a steady decline as a function of start time .",
    "this is because as the start time of the first observation ( i.e. , the template ) approaches the peak , the observed change in flux will decrease .",
    "therefore , it becomes progressively more difficult to detect a brightening and the required depth increases .",
    "specifically , for _ r_-band , no brightening is detected when utilizing strategies 1 and 2 . the same is effectively true for strategies 3 and 4 , unless the observations reach a depth of @xmath230 mag and begin @xmath90 3 hr after the gw trigger .",
    "thus , even with deep subaru hsc or lsst observations , brightening could only be detected in @xmath231% of sources for observations starting within 3 hours of the gw trigger . in _",

    "the 50% ( 95% ) contours start at @xmath234 mag and fall below the lsst limiting magnitude by @xmath235 hours .",
    "thus , the detection of a rise in @xmath69-band is not feasible with existing telescopes without a pre - existing template .",
    "lastly , for _ z_-band , the 50% ( 95% ) contours in strategies 1 and 2 begin at @xmath236 mag and fall below the lsst limiting magnitude by @xmath237 hours . for strategy 3 , the required depths are unchanged compared to strategies 1 and 2 , but the 50%(95% ) contours extend out to @xmath238 hours . for strategy 4 ,",
    "the required depth to achieve a 50% ( 95% ) detection rate is @xmath9 magnitude deeper compared to strategy 3 , but the required start times are identical .",
    "as above , this is possible with subaru hsc and lsst , but other instruments ( e.g. , decam , pan - starrs2 ) will only be able to achieve a 95% detection rate for @xmath70-band observations starting within @xmath192 hours of the gw trigger .",
    "this highlights the increased difficulty in characterizing the early - time behavior of the light curve because we lose information from the first epoch when it is used as the template image .",
    "we note that this information can be recovered after the fact using a late - time template but here we are concerned with rapid identification .",
    "we now investigate how the absence of a pre - existing template affects our ability to reject contaminants .",
    "we carry out our simulations in the following way .",
    "the flux in the first observation ( the template ) is subtracted off from the later observations .",
    "noise calculations are handled identically to those outlined above for the detectability simulation , and we impose the same detection criterion for events .",
    "the rise / decline time phase - space coordinates are computed using the same definition as in section  [ sec : mcsims_cont ] .",
    "the challenge then is computing an analogue for the values of the @xmath169 color and @xmath189 when the source flux is not known absolutely ( due to the presence of source flux in the template image ) .    when there is source flux in the template image we are only able to measure a difference in flux between the template and science image .",
    "we denote this as @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the flux observed in the science image and @xmath241 is the flux observed in the template image , both in some bandpass @xmath39 .",
    "we can then define an ab magnitude using the standard formula @xmath242 , where the star denotes magnitudes computed from a difference in flux .",

    "lastly , we construct a straight - forward analogue to the rise / decline time-@xmath248 slice of our phase - space . in the case of a rising source , we compute @xmath249 using the largest positive difference in flux between the template image and the science images . if the source is observed only in decline then the largest negative difference in flux is used .",

    "we note that when the observed rise time is small ( @xmath90 1 day , i.e. when the difference in time between the template and first science image is small ) then the color is not well constrained due to @xmath250 being too small to obtain an accurate measurement .",

    ", the resulting neutrino luminosity will raise the electron fraction of the disk wind ejecta and will suppress r - process nucleosynthesis .",

    "this is shallower than the depth required for the dynamical ejecta alone , but still within reach of the larger telescopes .",
    "when a slower cadence strategy is utilized ( e.g. , strategy 2 which involves observations every other night after the first observation ) the 95% detection criterion drops to 24.7 mag for observations starting more than six hours after the gw trigger .",
    "this is due to the rapid decline of the light curve after peak .",
    "observations must then be deeper at late times to obtain the necessary three epochs for a detection .",

    "the typical depth required to detect 50% ( 95% ) of events is 24.7 ( 25.9 ) mag for observing strategies 1 and 2 , comparable to those required for the dynamical ejecta alone because the precursor is short - lived .",

    "brightening in the source is never observed .",
    "this is because the source peaks in @xmath11 2 hours , while a reasonable start time is longer .",
    "ultimately , the case of a long - lived hmns irradiating the ejecta shows the strongest potential impact on kilonova _ r_-band detectability .",
    "however , this component has a strong dependence on viewing angle and thus will not always be observed .",
    "in addition , this component is still faint , requiring observations that achieve a depth of @xmath327 mag in _ r_-band to detect 95% of the sources .",

    "motivated by the results of our simulated observations , we now assess the most effective methodologies for conducting efficient gw follow - up observations .",
    "there are two primary issues to address : the detection of a kilonovae , and its identification against a population of contaminant sources .",
    "our simulations show that , in the case of a pre - existing template , observations which achieve a depth of @xmath328 mag and @xmath329 mag lead to the detection of about 95% of kilonovae .",
    "furthermore , observations should commence within 12 hours of the gw trigger to maximize the likelihood of detecting the source during the rise to peak .",
    "we also show that cuts made on @xmath169 color , the rise time ( if available ) , and @xmath189 are strong discriminants for separating a kilonova from the contaminant population .",
    "quantitatively , with @xmath199 mag , a rise time of @xmath268 days , and @xmath330 mag , we can eliminate a significant fraction @xmath331 of contaminants without removing any kilonovae .",
    "if the source is seen in decline then requiring @xmath199 mag and @xmath330 mag are still strong cuts , eliminating @xmath216 of contaminants .",
    "if we also require a decline time of @xmath219 days then we can eliminate @xmath332 of contaminants , however this cut eliminates nearly half of the kilonova population .",
    "these results do not depend strongly on the choice of cadence ( i.e. , there is no benefit from intra - night observations ) .",
    "therefore , follow - up observations should include a single visit per filter per night for at least the first few nights following a trigger .",

    "additionally , observing a kilonova at early times is important both for constraining the ejecta parameters and for testing the alternative kilonovae models outlined in section  [ sec : altkilo ] .",
    "ultimately , our ability to address the three questions above depends heavily on the facilities in use .    to investigate the impact of the choice of observing facility on gw",
    "follow - up we determine the expected performance of several current and future wide - field telescopes .",
    "specifically , we consider the performance of decam , ztf , subaru hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) , pan - starrs2 , and lsst .",
    "we take into account the field - of - view ( fov ) per pointing , the required integration time to achieve a depth of @xmath341 , @xmath328 , and @xmath329 mag , and consequently how much area can be covered per hour of observing time .",
    "we also compute the sky coverage rate when observing in @xmath69- and @xmath70-band to obtain color data .",
    "these values are given in table  [ tab : tele ] .",
    "we first look to currently available facilities ( e.g. , decam , hsc , and pan - starrs2 ) . in the northern hemisphere",
    "the two available telescopes are pan - starrs2 and hsc .",
    "pan - starrs2 offers an impressive fov ( @xmath342 deg@xmath2 ) allowing a @xmath304 deg@xmath2 region to be imaged in just @xmath343 pointings .",
    "however , hsc is the clear front - runner as the immense collecting area allows observations to achieve the target depths in much shorter integration times than pan - starrs2 .",
    "thus , despite the smaller fov of hsc , the sky coverage rate for @xmath69- and @xmath70-band data is faster than pan - starrs2 by over a factor of two .",
    "if we consider a typical gw localization region ( @xmath1 deg@xmath2 ) then pan - starrs2 can image this region to the required @xmath69- and @xmath70-band depths in @xmath344 hours while achieving this goal with hsc will require only @xmath19 hours",
    ". in the southern hemisphere decam is the ideal choice .",
    "the wide fov and red - sensitive ccd of decam allow it to quickly image a typical gw localization region .",
    "if we again consider a @xmath304 deg@xmath2 localization region , then decam can obtain @xmath69- and @xmath70-band data at the required depths in @xmath345 hours .",
    "we now consider future wide - field telescopes .",
    "the next major instrument to become available will be ztf .",
    "the primary advantage of ztf is the extremely wide fov @xmath346 deg@xmath2 ) , allowing even large localization regions to be imaged in just a handful of pointings .",
    "however , the longer integration times required to achieve the target depths means that the sky coverage rate of ztf will be slower than decam , pan - starrs2 , and hsc in @xmath3- and @xmath69-band .",
    "furthermore , the lack of @xmath70-band capabilities makes obtaining @xmath169 color data impossible ( observations in @xmath69-band alone may still be useful , see below ) .",
    "looking further ahead , gw follow - up with lsst will be particularly effective .",
    "the large collecting area and high sensitivity allow lsst to image a gw localization region with unparalleled rapidity . if we again consider a typical localization region ( @xmath1 deg@xmath2 ) , then ztf will require @xmath347 hours in @xmath3-band and and @xmath348 hours in @xmath69-band to image the entire region to the required depths . by comparison , lsst can image the entire localization region to the required depths in @xmath69- and @xmath70-band in just @xmath348 minutes , highlighting the immense observing power of future facilities .",
    "however , lsst is not expected to begin science operations until @xmath349 when gw localizations will be much improved .    while gw follow - up observations should strive to obtain @xmath169 color data as outlined above ,",
    "this may not be possible because either there is insufficient time to observe the localization region in @xmath350 or because @xmath70-band observations are not feasible ( e.g. , ztf ) . in this scenario ,",
    "data may be taken in a single filter , the identification of a kilonova becomes difficult .",
    "we dedicate the rest of this section to a brief discussion of eliminating contaminants when only single filter observations are possible .",
    "the most populous contaminant to contend with is the type ia sne . in the context of observations utilizing a single filter ,",
    "these contaminants are most easily eliminated by utilizing their much slower rise and decline timescales .",
    "therefore , the best method to reject these sources is to perform image subtraction using observations that are separated by ( e.g. , @xmath351 day between epochs ) .",
    "type ia sne are unlikely to be detected in these subtractions as they are unable to produce a statistically significant change in flux between the two epochs .",
    "qualitatively , if we require a source to exhibit a change in flux of at least @xmath330 mag and a rise time of @xmath268 days , then we can eliminate @xmath352 of detected type ia sne .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath192 detected events remaining after the cuts have been applied .",
    "however , we also eliminate @xmath353 of detected kilonova , with the higher fraction of sources eliminated in strategies 3 and 4 where the rapid cadence of observations on the first night produces smaller values of @xmath354 . for sources seen on the decline ,",
    "if we require that the decline time is @xmath219 days and the change in flux is @xmath330 , then we eliminate all of the detected type ia sne , while rejecting only @xmath355 of detected kilonovae . in both scenarios",
    "( e.g. , sources seen to rise or only in decline ) rejected kilonovae can be recovered using a late - time template image , but real time detection may be difficult . still , despite their high expected rates , type ia sne will likely prove to be one of the easiest contaminants to eliminate in gw follow - up searches .",
    "we can also apply the above argument to pan - starrs fast transients that are seen only in decline .",
    "qualitatively , if we require that sources exhibit a decline time of @xmath219 days and a change in flux of @xmath330 , then we can eliminate @xmath215 of the detected pan - starrs fast transients , again while rejected @xmath355 of the detected kilonovae . while the cuts on decline time and @xmath354 are not as effective here as in the case of type ia sne , the lower rates ( @xmath356 total expected during a typical gw follow - up search ) means that we expect only @xmath307 detected events to survive .",
    "these remaining sources can then be followed - up and eliminated by utilizing pointed observations as described below .    while inter - night variability is an effective tool for eliminating slowly evolving contaminants , it is not feasible for the rapidly - evolving contaminants ( e.g. , type .ia , miscellaneous fast transients , and pan - starrs fast transients observed on the rise ) as they exhibit timescales and changes in brightness comparable to those of kilonovae .",
    "we can rule out type .ia and miscellaneous fast transients as likely contaminants by utilizing the rate information from section  [ sec : rates ] .",
    "we showed that the rates for such events are low , resulting in @xmath251 source expected on the timescale and in the area of a typical gw follow - up campaign .",
    "we further showed in section  [ sec : diff ] , that if the rate information is convolved with the detection rates in our simulations , then we expect @xmath273 of these contaminants to appear during the course of follow - up observations . in this case , even considering the fact that the rates are poorly constrained , it is unlikely that these sources will lead to significant contamination .",
    "however , this rate argument does not apply to the pan - starrs fast transients as the rates of these events are sufficiently high ( @xmath356 expected during follow - up of a typical gw error region ) that they are likely to represent significant contamination .",
    "in this case , the best option is to include any such sources in a list of kilonova candidates for follow up with pointed observations as described below or wait until the source begins to decline and apply the inter - night variability arguments outlined above .",
    "lastly , we consider flaring stars ( e.g. , m - dwarfs , section  [ sec : flarestar ] ) as such events are likely to become contaminants in observing strategies that rely on a single epoch to identify sources .",
    "this is particularly true for observations carried out in bluer bands ( e.g. , @xmath106 or @xmath3 ) where the flares amplitudes are larger and the kilonova timescales are much shorter . given that flares generally exhibit short timescales ( minutes to hours , berger et al .",
    "2013 ) then if we require that a source be detected in at least two epochs separated by @xmath351 day we can efficiently eliminate all flare contaminants .",
    "the primary concern here is that rapidly evolving kilonovae ( e.g. , in @xmath3 band around peak ) will also be eliminated , particularly if observations are unable to achieve a depth of @xmath341 mag resulting in the kilonovae only being detected in one or two epochs . additionally , in @xmath3-band",
    ", the quiescent counterpart may be difficult to identify in the template images .",
    "these complications can be avoided by carrying out follow - up observations in @xmath69- or @xmath70-band .    taking the above considerations into account",
    ", we conclude that single filter observations , particularly those conducted in @xmath70-band , are still viable for kilonova identification .",
    "we favor data taken in @xmath70-band as the shallower depths required to achieve a 95% detection rate ( when compared to the depths required to achieve a comparable detection rate in @xmath3- or @xmath69-band ) allow substantially more sky area to be covered in a night of observations .",
    "furthermore , we have shown above that observations in @xmath70-band still allow robust contaminant rejection ( although still less robust than when color data is available ) without being susceptible to additional contamination from stellar flares as may be the case for observations in @xmath3- and @xmath69-band .",
    "we note that observational strategies that utilize a single filter are not likely to produce a single , obvious kilonova",
    ". this may be particularly true when a pre - existing template is unavailable , reducing the efficacy of our cuts on the timescale and change in brightness .",
    "however , the strategies outlined in this section can still be utilized to generate a list of kilonova candidates . in this scenario , once a list of @xmath357 candidates is generated , those sources can be further observed in the nir and spectroscopically .",
    "nir follow - up is crucial as kilonova are substantially redder than the other contaminants considered , with the kilonova spectrum peaking at @xmath358 m .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopic observations will allow us to look for features consistent with the production of @xmath3-process elements as another means of kilonova identification .",
    "these observations will vastly improve the robustness of kilonova identification and will allow us to maximize the science gained from a gw event .",
    "the worst - case scenario is a gw localization region that is simply too large to observe at the required depth in the available time , even in a single filter . here",
    ", there are two possible approaches .",
    "the first is to simply obtain shallower observations at a depth that allows the entire gw localization region to be imaged",
    ". this will be useful if the source is located closer than the fiducial distance of 200 mpc considered here , or if the ejecta mass is larger than the fiducial value of 0.01 @xmath359 .",
    "however , this is risky as shallower observations are unlikely to detect the typical event .",
    "furthermore , even if a kilonova is detected , it may only appear in one or two epochs , making it more difficult to distinguish from stellar flares .",
    "a less risky approach is to carry out the observations at the required depth , but cover the highest probability portion of the localization region , thereby maximizing the likelihood of detecting the kilonova .",
    "the era of gravitational wave astronomy is fast approaching , with ground - based gw interferometers expected to achieve direct detections of the inspiral and merger of compact object binaries sometime during the next few years .",
    "if we wish the maximize the science gains of these detections then the rapid identification of an em counterpart is essential .",
    "observational and theoretical evidence suggests a host of potential em counterparts spanning a wide range of timescales , luminosities , and wavelengths . among these",
    ", the isotropic optical emission powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath3-process elements synthesized in the merger ejecta has proven to be a particularly enticing target .",
    "a major challenge for follow - up observations is the large sky area that needs to be observed @xmath360 combined with a substantial depth to detect a typical event .",
    "consequently , optical searches for kilonovae will be plagued by contamination from other common transient events ( e.g. , type ia sne ) as well as from other rapidly evolving transients ( e.g. , see section  [ sec : contaminants ] ) .",
    "we have performed comprehensive simulations designed to probe the range of depths and cadences that may be involved in a gw follow - up campaign to determine the set of observations that will allow kilonove detections coupled with efficient rejection of contaminants .",
    "we find that :    * in the case where a pre - existing template image of the target region is available ( section  [ sec : mcsims_det ] ) , the optimal strategy for kilonova detection is to image the region to @xmath4 and @xmath5 mag with a single visit per night .",
    "we have shown that these limits are necessary to achieve a 95% kilonova detection rate .",
    "furthermore , observations should ideally commence within 12 hours of the gw trigger to facilitate the detection of a rise to peak in the light curve . * for sources observed on the rise , cuts on @xmath169 color and rise time",
    "are effective at distinguishing kilonovae from the contaminant population ( section  [ sec : mcsims_cont ] ) .",
    "specifically , with @xmath199 mag and a rise time of @xmath268 days , it is possible to eliminate @xmath361 of contaminants without rejecting any kilonovae .",
    "applying the same cuts to sources seen only in decline is less effective .",
    "if we require @xmath199 mag and a decline time of @xmath325 days then we again eliminate @xmath361 of the contaminant population , but lose nearly half of the kilonovae .",
    "these rejected kilonovae can be recovered using a late - time template @xmath362 days ) , but real - time kilonova identification will be hampered .",
    "* in the case where a pre - existing template is not available ( section  [ sec : diff ] ) , we find that there is no effect on the optimal cadence , but observations must go @xmath293 magnitude deeper than in the pre - existing template case to achieve comparable detection rates .",
    "the detection of a rise is also more difficult since the first observation must be used as a template image , reducing the amount of early - time data .",
    "* in the case where a pre - existing template template is not available , cuts on @xmath169 color and timescale are still effective for separating kilonovae from the contaminant population for sources observed during the rise to peak ( section  [ sec : diff ] ) .",
    "however , for sources seen only in decline , these cuts are significantly less effective .",
    "we do note that by utilizing a detection criterion based on the change in brightness in an observed source we can reduce the number of contaminant sources detected .",
    "however , this also reduces the kilonovae detection rates . * for the alternative kilonova models ( section  [ sec : altkilo ] ) we find that @xmath3-band detectability in the speculative case of a long - lives hmns producing an early - time blue component may improve , but the short - lived nature of this component combined with the strong dependance on viewing angle means that it is not likely to be observed .",
    "if the kilonova is accompanied by a neutron precursor ( section  [ sec : neutronpre ] ) , then this component will appear brighter than a kilonova ( @xmath363 mag ) , but the extremely short timescale ( @xmath364 hrs ) makes it unlikely to appear in follow - up observations .",
    "* we examine the potential of current and future wide - field telescope facilities to achieve the observational goals outlined above ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) . for current facilities",
    ", we find that subaru hsc is the best option for localization regions in the northern hemisphere while decam is best suited to gw follow - up in the southern hemisphere .",
    "both telescopes can easily image an entire gw localization region to the required depths in @xmath69- and @xmath70-band at the required cadence . in the future ,",
    "gw follow - up with lsst will be particularly effective and rapid . *",
    "if data in both @xmath69- and @xmath70-band can not be obtained due to observational constraints , then an attempt at kilonova identification can be made using data from a single filter , ideally @xmath70-band ( section  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we found that without color data it is still possible to eliminate the most numerous contaminants ( e.g. , type ia sne and pan - starrs fast transients ) by utilizing their slow light curve evolution when compared to kilonovae .",
    "the rapidly evolving contaminants ( e.g. , type .ia and miscellaneous fast transients ) are not likely to be a significant contaminant on the basis of their low expected rates .",
    "lastly , m - dwarf stellar flares are easily rejected by requiring that the source appear in at least two epochs or by identifying a quiescent counterpart in the template image .    the next step of this analysis is to test the methodologies and conclusions of this work against a set of real data . as discussed in section  [",

    "<S> the first direct detection of gravitational waves ( gw ) by the ground - based advanced ligo / virgo interferometers is expected to occur within the next few years . </S>",
    "<S> these interferometers are designed to detect the mergers of compact object binaries composed of neutron stars and/or black holes to a fiducial distance of @xmath0 mpc and a localization region of @xmath1 deg@xmath2 . to maximize the science gains from such gw detections </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to identify electromagnetic ( em ) counterparts . among the wide range of proposed counterparts , </S>",
    "<S> the most promising is optical / ir emission powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath3-process elements synthesized in the neutron - rich merger ejecta  a `` kilonova '' . here </S>",
    "<S> we present detailed simulated observations that encompass a range of strategies for kilonova searches during gw follow - up . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize these simulations to assess both the detectability of kilonovae and our ability to distinguish them from a wide range of contaminating transients in the large gw localization regions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that if pre - existing deep template images for the gw localization region are available , then nightly observations to a depth of @xmath4 mag and @xmath5 mag are required to achieve a 95% detection rate ; observations that commence within @xmath6 hours of trigger will also capture the kilonova peak and provide stronger constraints on the ejecta properties . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that kilonovae can be robustly separated from other known and hypothetical types of transients utilizing cuts on color ( @xmath7 mag ) and rise time ( @xmath8 days ) . in the absence of a pre - existing template the observations </S>",
    "<S> must reach @xmath9 mag deeper to achieve the same kilonova detection rate , but robust rejection of contaminants can still be achieved . motivated by the results of our simulations we discuss the expected performance of current and future wide - field telescopes in achieving these observational goals , and find that prior to lsst the dark energy camera ( decam ) on the blanco 4-m telescope and hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) on the subaru 8-m telescope offer the best kilonova discovery potential . </S>"
