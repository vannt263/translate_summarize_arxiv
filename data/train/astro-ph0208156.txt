    "the leading models for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) involve a relativistic wind emanating from a compact central source .",
    "the prompt gamma - ray emission is usually attributed to energy dissipation within the outflow itself , due to internal shocks within the flow that arise from variability in its lorentz factor , while the afterglow emission arises from an external shock that is driven into the ambient medium , as it decelerates the ejected matter ( rees & mszros 1994 ; sari & piran 1997 ) . in this",
    "so called ` internal - external ' shock model , the duration of the prompt grb is directly related to the time during which the central source is active .",
    "the most popular emission mechanism is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated in the shocks , that radiate in the strong magnetic fields ( close to equipartition values ) within the shocked plasma .",
    "an additional radiation mechanism that may also play some role is synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , which is the upscattering of the synchrotron photons by the relativistic electrons , to much higher energies .",
    "progenitor models of grbs are divided into two main categories .",
    "the first category involves the merger of a binary system of compact objects , such as a double neutron star ( ns - ns , eichler et al .",
    "1989 ) , a neutron star and a black hole ( ns - bh , narayan , pacyski & piran 1992 ) or a black hole and a helium star or a white dwarf ( bh - he , bh - wd , fryer & woosley 1998 ; fryer , woosley & hartmann 1999 ) .",
    "the second category involves the death of a massive star .",
    "it includes the failed supernova ( woosley 1993 ) or hypernova ( pacyski 1998 ) models , where a black hole is created promptly , and a large accretion rate from a surrounding accretion disk ( or torus ) feeds a strong relativistic jet in the polar regions .",
    "this type of model is known as the collapsar model . an alternative model within this second category",
    "is the supranova model ( vietri & stella 1998 ) , where a massive star explodes in a supernova and leaves behind a supra - massive neutron star ( smns ) which on a time scale of a few years loses its rotational energy and collapses to a black hole , triggering the grb event .",
    "long grbs ( with a duration @xmath0 ) are usually attributed to the second category of progenitors , while short grbs are attributed to the first category . in all the different scenarios mentioned above",
    ", the final stage of the process consists of a newly formed black hole with a large accretion rate from a surrounding torus , and involve a similar energy budget ( @xmath1 ) .    in this work",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the supranova model , focusing on its possible observational signatures .",
    "this aims towards establishing tools that would enable us to distinguish between the supranova model and other progenitor models through observations , and to constrain the model parameter using current observations .",
    "the original motivation for the supranova model was to provide a relatively baryon clean environment for the grb jet .",
    "as it turned out , it also seemed to naturally accommodate the later detection of iron lines in several x - ray afterglows ( lazzati , campana , & ghisellini 1999 ; piro et al .",
    "2000 ; vietri et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "it was later suggested that the most natural mechanism by which the smns can lose its rotational energy is through a strong pulsar type wind , between the supernova and the grb events , which typically creates a pulsar wind bubble ( pwb ) , also referred to as a plerion ( knigl & granot 2002 , kg hereafter ; inoue , guetta & pacini 2002 , igp hereafter ) .",
    "kg suggested that the shocked pulsar wind into which the afterglow shock propagates in this picture may naturally account for the large inferred values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( the fractions of the internal energy in the electrons and in the magnetic field , respectively ) that are inferred from fits to afterglow observations ( wijers & galama 1999 ; granot , piran & sari 1999 ; chevalier & li 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2002 ) .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that pulsar winds are believed to largely consist of electron - positron pairs , and have magnetization parameters in the right range .",
    "this relaxes the need of generating strong magnetic fields in the shock itself , as is required in other models , where the magnetic field in the external medium ( assumed to be either the ism or a stellar wind of a massive star progenitor ) is typically too small to account for the values of @xmath4 that are inferred from observations .",
    "another attractive feature of this model , pointed out by igp is the possible high energy emission , in the gev - tev range , that may result from the upscattering of photons from the plerion by the relativistic electrons in the afterglow shock ( external compton , ec hereafter ) , and may be detected by glast .",
    "they have shown that the ec emission can provide a viable explanation for the extended gev emission seen by egret in grb 940217 ( hurley et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "we use a simple spherical model for the pwb .",
    "we find that a spherical model can not accommodate the typical afterglow emission together with the iron line features observed in the x - ray afterglow of some grbs .",
    "however , it was mentioned early on that in order to have a long lived afterglow emission together with the iron line features , a deviation from spherical symmetry is needed , where the line of sight is relatively devoid of the material producing the iron lines ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ; vietri et al .",
    "this is required in order to avoid a direct collision of the afterglow shock with the line producing material on an observed time of the order of a day or so .",
    "it was later pointed out that a pwb is expected to exist inside the snr shell , which decelerates the afterglow shock at a smaller radius , so that in order for the afterglow to remain relativistic up to a month or more , and produce the iron lines , we need the pwb to be elongated along its rotational axis ( kg ) . in this paper",
    "we strengthen this conclusion , and show that in order to produce iron lines with a spherical pwb , its radius must be sufficiently small , resulting in a large density inside the pwb and a high self absorption frequency implying no radio afterglow , in contrast with observations .",
    "we leave the detailed treatment of an elongated pwb to a future work , while in the present work we briefly comment about the expected effects of an elongated geometry compared to a spherical one .    in this work",
    "we extend the analysis of kg and igp , and perform detailed calculations of the radiation from the pwb , the prompt grb and from the afterglow that occur inside the pwb .",
    "we now give a short overview of the structure of the paper , where in each section we stress the original features , new results and the observational constraints on the model . in  [ pwb ]",
    "we present our `` pwb '' model , introduce the relevant parameterization and model the acceleration of the supernova remnant ( snr ) shell by the shocked pulsar wind .",
    "we use a simple spherical geometry and the pulsar wind is assumed to consist of proton and @xmath5 components with roughly equal energies , as well as a magnetic field .",
    "the conditions under which the iron line features that were observed in several x - ray afterglows may be reproduced within the pwb model , are investigated in  [ lines ] .",
    "we find that this requires a time delay of @xmath6yr between the supernova and the grb events . in ",
    "[ pleremis ] we perform a detailed study of the plerion emission , including the synchrotron and ssc components , and provide an elaborate description of the relevant klein - nishina effect .",
    "we also discuss the upper cutoff that is imposed on high energy photons due to pair production with the radiation field of the pwb , go over the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission , and derive observational constraints on the parameters of our model .",
    "the effects of the pwb environment on the prompt grb emission are analyzed in  [ prompt_grb ] , and we find that the ec from the prompt grb should typically be very small , but might be detectable for extreme parameters . in  [ afterglow ]",
    "we discuss the implications of a plerionic environment on the afterglow emission , and introduce the appropriate parameterization .",
    "the radial density profile of the pwb is approximated as a power law in radius ( kg ) , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 typically ranges between @xmath9 ( similar to an ism ) and @xmath10 ( intermediate between an ism and a stellar wind ) .",
    "the synchrotron , ssc and ec components are calculated and we provide detailed expressions for the break frequencies and flux normalization , for @xmath11 .",
    "we also calculate the high energy emission that is predicted in this model .",
    "the results are discussed in  [ discussion ] and in ",
    "[ conclusions ] we give our conclusions .",
    "within the framework of the supranova model , a smns ( also simply referred to as a pulsar ) is formed in a supranova explosion , and then loses a large part of its rotational energy before collapsing to a black hole and triggering the grb .",
    "the most plausible mechanism for this energy loss is through a pulsar type wind ( kg ; igp ) .",
    "a pulsar wind bubble ( pwb ) is formed when the relativistic wind ( consisting of relativistic particles and magnetic fields ) that emanates from a pulsar is abruptly decelerated ( typically , to a newtonian velocity ) in a strong relativistic shock , due to interaction with the ambient medium .",
    "when a bubble of this type expands inside a snr , it gives rise to a plerionic snr , of which the crab and vela remnants are prime examples .",
    "motivated by previous works ( rees & gunn 1974 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ; emmering & chevalier 1987 ; kg ) we consider in detail a spherical model where the shocked pulsar wind remains largely confined within the snr . in ",
    "[ discussion ] briefly discuss the possible consequences of some more complicated geometries .",
    "the wind luminosity may be estimated by the magnetic dipole formula ( pacini 1967 ) , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the polar surface magnetic field , @xmath14 is the circumferential radius ( neglecting the distinction between its equatorial and polar values in this approximation ) , and @xmath15 is the ( uniform ) angular velocity ( whose maximum value is @xmath16 ; e.g. , haensel , lasota , & zdunik 1999 ) .",
    "the spin - down time of a rapidly rotating smns can be estimated as @xmath17 ( see vietri & stella 1998 ) , where @xmath18 is the portion of the rotational energy of an smns of mass @xmath19 and angular velocity @xmath15 that needs to be lost before it becomes unstable to collapse . , where the parameter @xmath20 measures the stellar angular momentum in units of @xmath21 and has values in the range @xmath22 for realistic equations of state ( e.g. , cook , shapiro & teukolsky 1994 ; salgado et al .",
    "the spindown timescale , that sets the time delay between the supernova and grb events , depends on the physical parameters of the smns . of these parameters ,",
    "the least constrained is the magnetic field , which is typically expected to be in the range of @xmath23 , and may cause a variation of @xmath24 orders of magnitude in @xmath25 .",
    "there is also a strong dependence on the radius @xmath14 , which depends on its mass @xmath19 and the ( uncertain ) equation of state , that may account for a change of up to @xmath26 order of magnitude in the scaling of @xmath25 .",
    "for example , for @xmath27 , with the values of the other parameters as given in eq .",
    "( [ t_sd ] ) , we have @xmath28 .",
    "we conclude that the expected range of @xmath25 is from a few weeks to several years .    during",
    "@xmath25 the luminosity of the wind is roughly constant and the wind should energize the pwb depositing an energy of the order of @xmath29 .",
    "the luminosity of the pulsar wind is divided between its different components : fractions @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 in @xmath5 pairs , protons and poynting flux ( magnetic field ) , respectively .",
    "the inferred values of @xmath33 for pwbs , such as vela or the crab , are typically @xmath34 ( arons 2002 ) , though there are also estimates as high as @xmath26 ( helfand , gotthelf & halpern 2001 ) .",
    "we shall adopt a fiducial value of @xmath35 , which implies @xmath36 .",
    "gallant & arons ( 1994 ) inferred @xmath37 for the the crab , and we adopt this estimate for our fiducial values , and use @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the inferred values of the lorentz factor of the pulsar wind are @xmath40 .",
    "the sn ejecta is accelerated by the force exerted due to the pressure of the expanding pwb , @xmath41 , at its outer boundary , i.e. at the radius of the snr , @xmath42 .",
    "the pressure is expected to drop by a factor of order unity between the radius of the wind termination shock , @xmath43 , and @xmath42 ( kg ) , so that @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the average pressure inside the pwb , @xmath46 is the fraction of the energy @xmath29 that remains in the pwb , @xmath47 is the volume of the pwb ( which can be different for an elongated pwb ) and @xmath48 is the energy emitted in the wind up to the time @xmath49 . as we show below , the pwb is typically in fast cooling , and the electrons lose all of their internal energy to radiation , implying @xmath50 .",
    "the equation of motion , @xmath51 , may be written as @xmath52    in the case of a non - spherical pwb , @xmath53 should be replaced by the isotropic equivalent mass , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 becomes @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the angle from the polar axis . however , the pressure can be taken as independent of the angle @xmath57 , since the shocked pulsar wind is highly sub - sonic .",
    "if @xmath58 is smaller near the poles ( @xmath59 ) and larger near the equator ( @xmath60 ) , then even if the snr shell is initially spherical , the acceleration would be larger near the poles , resulting in a much larger polar radius , @xmath61 , compared to the equatorial radius , @xmath62 : @xmath63 .",
    "this is a natural mechanism that can lead to an elongated geometry for the pwb .",
    "returning to the spherical case , the acceleration becomes significant at the time @xmath64 ( and radius @xmath65 ) when @xmath66 first exceed the initial kinetic energy of the snr , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) , where @xmath69 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the dynamics are given by @xmath73 @xmath74 these scalings agree with the results of reynolds & chevalier ( 1984 ) . at @xmath75",
    "we have @xmath76 , and conservation of energy implies that @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "our fiducial value of @xmath79 implies @xmath80 , which is reasonable .",
    "we also obtain that @xmath81 . for a typical ejected mass , @xmath82",
    ", this would imply @xmath83 .",
    "finally we have @xmath84 where we set @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "to the extent that @xmath87 has nearly the same value in all sources , the magnitude of @xmath88 is determined by that of @xmath25 . in a similar vien ,",
    "if the energy lost during the smns lifetime , @xmath89 , is approximately constant from source to source ( @xmath90 ) , then @xmath25 can also be used to parameterize the smns wind power : @xmath91 .",
    "the acceleration of the snr shell by the lower - density bubble gas would subject it to a rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability , which could lead to clumping ( jun 1998 ) .",
    "the growth timescale of the rt instability on a spatial scale r is @xmath92 .",
    "the important quantity to estimate in order to see if the snr shell can be clumped is the ratio between @xmath93 and the dynamical timescale @xmath94 @xmath95 where we have used eq .",
    "( [ eom ] ) .",
    "this implies @xmath96 during the acceleration ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this could produce only moderately strong fragmentation over the dynamical time of the system .",
    "however , as the acceleration occurs over @xmath98 orders of magnitude in radius [ see eq .",
    "( [ ratios ] ) ] , the radius doubles itself @xmath99 times during the course of the snr acceleration , so that despite the fact that @xmath100 is of order unity , it is feasible that considerable clumpiness may still be caused due to the rt instability . an even stronger fragmentation may occur if the rt instabilities grow on a length scale @xmath101 smaller than r ( i.e. @xmath102 ) , where in this case @xmath103 .    in order to calculate the emission from the plerion , we use the average quantities of the shocked pulsar wind within the pwb , and neglect their variation with radius .",
    "the latter is expected to be more important in the afterglow emission , and is therefore taken into account in  [ afterglow ] that discusses the afterglow emission .",
    "the postshock energy density is given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the total volume within the pwb , and is approximately equal to the volume occupied by the shocked wind .",
    "for an elongated pwb the expression for the volume , @xmath106 , will be different , but it can directly be plugged into these equations , in place of the spherical expression .",
    "the injection rates of electron - positron pairs and of protons at the source are given by @xmath107 hence , the total number of particles within @xmath88 at time @xmath49 is @xmath108 , and the number density at @xmath25 is @xmath109 fractions @xmath110 of the post - shock energy density go to the magnetic field , the electrons and the protons , respectively .",
    "we expect these fractions to be similar to those in the pulsar wind ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) and use the corresponding fiducial values .",
    "subscripts containing the letter b denote quantities related to the pwb .",
    "the electrons will lose energy through synchrotron emission and inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "we study the characteristic features of the plerion emission and investigate the conditions required for the production of the observed iron lines and whether the plerion can be detected by the present instruments .",
    "moreover , an important implication of the plerion emission is that the grb should explode inside a radiation rich environment ( i.e. , the luminous radiation field of the pwb ) .",
    "the external photons are highly doppler - boosted in the rest frame of the shocked fluid , for both internal and external shocks ( that are responsible for the prompt grb and afterglow emission , respectively ) , and can act as efficient seed photons for ic scattering ( external comptonization , ec ) .",
    "we study the observational consequences of the ec process , both for the prompt grb emission and for the afterglow .    since we use a large number of parameters in the paper , and in order to make it easier to follow all the different parameters , we include a table ( table [ table1 ] ) with the most often used parameters , where we mention the meaning of each parameter and the fiducial value that we use for that parameter .",

    "another important conclusion is that iron line features that have been observed in a few x - ray afterglows can not be naturally explained within the simplest spherical version of the pwb model , that has been considered in this work .",

    "a large - scale toroidal magnetic field within the pwb may also contribute to the elongation of the snr shell along its polar axis ( kg ) .",
    "it is also likely that the progenitor star that gave rise to a smns had an anisotropic mass loss , which results in a density contrast between the equators ( where the density is higher ) and the poles ( where the density is lower ) .",
    "a sufficiently large density contrast between the equator and the poles can also contribute to the elongation of the shell , for sufficiently large @xmath25 , as the snr shell will begin to be decelerated due to the interaction with the external medium , at a smaller radius near the equator , compared to the poles .",
    "a similar non - spherical variant of the model is if we allow for holes in the snr shell , that extend over a small angle around the polar axis , where all the wind is decelerated in a termination shock within the snr shell ( @xmath715 ) , but most of the shocked pulsar wind can get out through the holes near the poles and reach a radius considerably larger than @xmath88 .",
    "this variant may be viewed as a limiting case of the previous variant , when the surface density contrast of the snr shell , between the equator and the poles is very large .",
    "this implies that most of the mass in the snr shell is concentrated near the equator , while only a small fraction of it is near the poles , so that the radius near the poles can be as large as @xmath716 , while the equatorial radius is @xmath717 . in both variants ,",
    "the total volume of the pwb is close to that of a sphere with the polar radius , and much larger than that of a sphere with the equatorial radius .",
    "this would allow for a smaller density with the same small value of the equatorial radius that is required to produce the iron lines .",

    "an important advantage of the pwb model is that it can naturally explain the large values of @xmath4 and @xmath139 that are inferred from fits to afterglow data ( kg ) , thanks to the large relative number of electron - positron pairs and large magnetic fields in the pwb .",
    "this is in contrast with standard environment that is usually assumed to be either an ism or the stellar wind of a massive progenitor , that consists of protons and electrons , and where the magnetic field is too small to explain the values inferred from afterglow observations , and magnetic field generation at the shock itself is required .",
    "additional advantages of the pwb model are its ability to naturally account for the range of external densities inferred from afterglow fits , and allowing for a homogeneous external medium ( @xmath718 ) , as inferred for most afterglows , with a massive star progenitor .",
    "another advantage of the pwb model is its capability of explaining the high energy emission observed in some grbs ( schneid et al .",

    "19994 ; schneid et al .",
    "we find that the high energy emission during the early afterglow at photon energies @xmath666kev is dominated by the external compton ( ec ) component , that is due to the upscattering of photons from the plerion radiation field to higher energies by the relativistic electrons behind the afterglow shock .",
    "we predict that such a high energy emission may be detected in a large fraction of grbs with the upcoming mission glast . however , we find an upper cutoff at a photon energy of @xmath719gev , due to opacity to pair production with the photons of the pwb .",
    "this implies no high energy emission above @xmath663gev for afterglows with x - ray line features , but allows photons up to an energy of @xmath663tev for afterglows with an external density typical of the ism ( @xmath617 ) .",

    "<S> we consider the possibility that at least some grb explosions take place inside pulsar wind bubbles ( pwbs ) , in the context of the supranova model , where initially a supernova explosion takes place , leaving behind a supra - massive neutron star ( smns ) , which loses its rotational energy on a time scale of months to tens of years and collapses to a black hole , triggering a grb explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural mechanism by which the smns can lose its rotational energy is through a strong pulsar type wind , between the supernova and the grb events , which is expected to create a pwb . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in some detail the observational implications of such a plerionic environment on the afterglow and prompt grb emissions , as well as the prospect for direct detection of the plerion emission . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for a simple spherical model , grbs with iron lines detected in their x - ray afterglow should not have a detectable radio afterglow , and should have small jet break times and non - relativistic transition times , in disagreement with observations for some of the grbs with x - ray lines . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies with the observations may be reconciled by resorting to a non - spherical geometry , where the pwb is elongated along the polar axis . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the emission from the pwb should persist well into the afterglow , and the lack of detection of such a component provides interesting constraints on the model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we predict that the inverse compton upscattering of the pwb photons by the relativistic electrons of the afterglow ( external compton , ec ) should lead to high energy emission during the early afterglow that might explain the gev photons detected by egret for a few grbs , and should be detectable by future missions such as glast . </S>"
