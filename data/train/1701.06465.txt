    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are mysterious astronomical radio transients with short intrinsic durations ( @xmath7 ) , large dispersion measures ( @xmath8 ) , and high galactic latitudes @xcite .",
    "recently , thanks to the precise localization and multi - wavelength follow - up observations of the repeating source frb 121102 @xcite , the distance scale of frbs has been finally settled to the cosmological range . so far , even though only frb 121102 has a measured redshift @xmath5 @xcite , the large dm excess of other frbs with respect to the galactic value and their high galactic latitudes suggest that most , if not all , frbs should have a cosmological origin .",
    "the host galaxies of frbs carry important information regarding the progenitor of frbs . for frb 121102 ,",
    "optical imaging and spectroscopy indicate a dwarf galaxy with a mass of @xmath9 as the host galaxy .",
    "the @xmath10 flux of the host galaxy suggests a star formation rate of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "no information about the host galaxies of other frbs is available .",
    "one possible way to derive frb host galaxy information is to extract the host galaxy dm from data .",
    "@xcite proposed a method to derive @xmath4 using the measured dm and @xmath12 of a sample of frbs .",
    "however , the @xmath12 values of most frbs are not obtained so far .    in this paper , we further develop a method to apply dm and flux of frbs to infer @xmath4 .",
    "this method is applied to the current frb sample with 18 sources . through a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc )",
    "simulation , we derive a relatively large mean host galaxy dm , @xmath0 , for frbs .",
    "we also provide two supporting evidence for a large value of @xmath4 : millisecond - duration of scattering tails for some frbs and @xmath13 for frb 121102 .",
    "for an frb , the observed dispersion measure has three contributions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , i.e. @xmath14 which are from the milk way , the frb host galaxy ( which itself includes the contributions from the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the host galaxy and a near - source plasma ) , and the igm , respectively . according to the galactic pulsar data",
    ", @xmath15 can be well constrained @xcite , which is a strong function of the galactic latitude @xmath16 , e.g. @xmath17 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath15 can be well extracted for a localized frb , one can define the extragalactic ( or excess ) dispersion measure of an frb as @xmath21 which can be treated as an observed quantity .",
    "the properties of frb host galaxies may be assumed to have no significant evolution with redshift , i.e. @xmath22 , where @xmath0 is the average value of the rest - frame host galaxy dm within a certain redshift of distance bin . due to cosmological time dilation ,",
    "the observed host dm value reads @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "considering the local inhomogeneity of the igm , we define a mean dm of the igm as @xcite @xmath24,\\nonumber\\\\ \\label{dm } \\label{dmigm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the hydrogen and helium mass fractions normalized to 3/4 and 1/4 , respectively , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the ionization fractions for hydrogen and helium , respectively . for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , due to full ionization of both hydrogen and helium @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath32 .",
    "we adopt the flat @xmath33 parameters recently derived from the _ plank _ data : @xmath34 , and @xmath35 @xcite . for the fraction of baryon mass in the intergalactic medium ,",
    "we adopt @xmath36 @xcite .    for an frb with an intrinsic frequency - dependent luminosity @xmath37 ,",
    "the observed flux is given by @xmath38 .",
    "the luminosity distance of the frb may be given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the isotropic intrinsic luminosity , and @xmath41 is the characteristic frequency of frbs - correction is needed to derive a more rigorous @xmath42 .",
    "however , the frb spectral shape is not well constrained .",
    "since the frb emission seems to peak around 1 ghz and since the frb redshift is not very high , our approximate treatment is justified . ] . for a flat universe",
    ", one has @xmath43 . \\label{dl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath44 , according to eq.([dm])-eq.([dl ] ) , we can obtain approximately @xmath45 , where @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , one has the @xmath47 relation : @xmath48 as shown in eq.([dmf ] ) , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , and @xmath51 for @xmath52 , where @xmath53",
    ".    one can numerically solve eq.([dm])-eq.([dl ] ) , and use the observed @xmath47 relation to fit the current sample of 18 frbs .",
    "we take the frb data from the _ frb catalogue _ of @xcite . for the repeating frb , frb 121102 , we take the brightest pulse as its peak flux .",
    "we apply the mcmc method to extract @xmath0 from the observed @xmath47 relation .",
    "the likelihood for the fitting parameters is determined by the @xmath54 statistics , i.e. @xmath55 where @xmath56 represents the sequence of an frb in the sample , @xmath57 represents the error of @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the system error , and @xmath60 is a fitting parameter reflecting the uncertainty of the model . we minimize @xmath54 and convert it into a probability density function .",
    "we can then obtain the probability distribution of the fitting parameters using the software _ _",
    "emcee__.    the analysis results are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we have @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "our results show that frbs may have a large host galaxy dm , although with large dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the luminosity distribution is quite narrow , which would suggest a possible common origin of the observed frbs .",
    "interestingly , we note that the fitting intrinsic luminosity @xmath64 is closed to the characteristic luminosity of the magnetar giant flares , e.g. @xmath65 . on the other hand , it is possible that frbs may have a wide luminosity function , with the fainter ones not detectable with current telescopes .",
    "our derived relatively large value of @xmath0 is supported by two other independent pieces of evidence .",
    "first , for galactic pulsars , the scattering time @xmath66 for @xmath67 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , some frbs with @xmath68 have measured scattering time of a few millisecond @xcite , suggesting that scattering happens outside the milky way . the scattering contribution from the igm",
    "is calculated to be negligibly small , so that most the scattering would occur in the frb host galaxy @xcite .",
    "observations show that a larger scattering tail correspond to a larger dm , e.g. @xmath69 for galactic pulsars",
    "@xcite , a fact understandable and required by turbulence theories @xcite . if one assumes that the frbs hosts have a similar relation , for the millisecond scattering time , one would require @xmath70 .",
    "this is consistent with our derived results .",
    "second , the host galaxy dm frb 121102 can be precisely derived .",
    "frb 121102 was localized to a @xmath71 arcsecond precision by @xcite .",
    "the observed dispersion measure is @xmath72 . according the location of frb 121102",
    ", @xcite identified an extended source coincident with the burst , which is a host galaxy at @xmath5 .",
    "adopting the _ plank _ cosmological parameters and @xmath73 , one derive @xmath74 .",
    "the mw contribution is @xmath75 in the direction @xcite .",
    "so one can derive @xmath76 and @xmath77 for frb 121102 .",
    "such a value is also consistent with our fitting results .",
    "the above results suggest that the frb host galaxies have a relatively large value of dm . there could be two possible contributions to such a large dm : the ism in the host galaxy and the near - source plasma .    for the case of a host ism",
    ", one immediate inference is that the type of the host galaxies of most frbs would not be mw - like disk galaxies .",
    "the reason is that for disk galaxies , frbs would be most likely emitted from galactic high latitudes , which gives rise to negligible dm .",
    "indeed , the host galaxy of frb 121102 was identified as a dwarf galaxy @xcite , which is consistent with our expectation .",
    "however , our inferred value is still somewhat larger than the simulated host galaxy dm for various types of galaxies @xcite , suggesting that a near - source plasma may be needed .    for the case of a near - source plasma",
    ", we consider the contributions from a snr , pwn , or hii region .",
    "first , in a thin shell approximation , the dm value through a young snr may be estimated by ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the snr mass , radius and thickness , respectively , and @xmath82 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "note that the snr dispersion measure does not depend on @xmath81 of the thin shell .",
    "the dm variation of the snr during an observation time @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the characterized snr velocity .",
    "the age of the snr may be estimated as @xmath86 . in principle , it is possible to expect that the host dm is dominated by a supernova ejecta . however , there are two caveats for this possibility : 1 .",
    "the thin shell model predicts an observable dm variation over the decade - long time scale , which is inconsistent with the non - variation dm of the repeating frbs during the approximately four - year period of observations ; 2 . for an age - independent event rate (",
    "the time delay between sn and frb is uniformly distributed for frbs ) , the cumulative distribution of dms of frbs should satisfies @xmath87 if the observed dm is dominated by the snrs associated with the frbs .",
    "however , the statistical results of the observed frbs obviously deviate from this relation @xcite .",
    "next , we consider the dm contribution from a pwn . some authors suggested an association of frbs with young pulsars @xcite , while some others suggested an association of frbs with magnetar giant flares @xcite . while these models are greatly constrained by available observations @xcite",
    ", we nonetheless consider the dm contribution from a pulsar / magnetar wind .",
    "the classical goldreich - julian number density is given by @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the polar - cap magnetic field strength , and @xmath90 is the rotation period .",
    "a relativistic electron - positron pair plasma is expected to stream out from the magnetosphere .",
    "the dm of the pulsar / magnetar wind may be estimated using the pair flux near the light cylinder ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the radius of the light cylinder , @xmath93 is multiplicity parameter , @xmath94 is relativistic wind lorentz factor at the light cylinder , and @xmath95 is the pulsar / magnetar spin - down luminosity . the pulsar / magnetar wind can provide a significant contribution to dm if @xmath96 is large enough .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a unified interpretation of frbs in the so - called `` cosmic comb '' model , which invokes the interaction between an astrophysical plasma stream and a foreground regular pulsar . since cosmic combs more easily happen in slow ( @xmath97 ) and low - field ( @xmath98  ) pulsars , the dm contribution from the near - source plasma is @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , in the cosmic comb model , the large host galaxy dm might result from the host galaxy ism or the near - source plasma of the stream source in front of the pulsar towards earth .    at last",
    ", we consider the dm contribution from a hii region in the host galaxy , assuming that an frb is embedded in a strmgren sphere .",
    "the dm contributed by a strmgren sphere may be estimated as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the gas number density in the hii region , @xmath102 is the rate of ionizing photons from a star , @xmath103 is the recombination rate , and @xmath104 is the strmgren radius .",
    "we assume that the there is an o5 star in hii region , so that @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and the strmgren radius is @xmath107 .",
    "we note that the strmgren radius is much larger than the projected size of @xmath108 of frb 121102 radio persistent emission source @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we show that the current frb observations imply large host galaxy dm values , e.g. , @xmath109 .",
    "such a large dm may be contributed by the host ism or a near - source plasma .",
    "such a result poses requirements to frb progenitor models .    in the total host galaxy",
    "dm , the contribution from the near - source plasma also plays an essential role to identify the progenitor systems of frbs .",
    "the various models have a wide dm distribution . for models invoking young energetic pulsars and magnetars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or collapse of new - born supra - massive neutron star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a near - source snr or pwn may give an important contribution to the observed dm . also irregular star - forming galaxies",
    "( e.g. the host galaxy of frb 121102 ) do not have a disk - like structure , and may provide a relatively large host dm . for the models invoking compact object mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the contribution from a near - source plasma may not be important .",
    "these systems may also have a large offset from the host galaxy .",
    "however , elliptical or early - type host galaxies that harbor these events may also provide large free electron column needed to account for the large @xmath4 inferred from the data .",
