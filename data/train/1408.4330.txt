    "over the last couple of decades , a significant amount of work has been performed in the area of temperature and species concentration determination using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "line - of - sight tdlas signals are , in essence , attenuation that is integrated along the beam path . hence , these techniques ,  while good for domains with uniform temperature and species concentration ,  are not readily applicable for areas where the fields vary significantly . for such cases ,",
    "the application of tomography along with tdlas provides a means to achieve spatially resolved beam attenuation data which can be subsequently used for the determination of temperature and concentration values .",
    "tomographic tdlas , for 1d tomography in particular , is generally achieved by acquiring los attenuation data , ",
    "i.e. projections ,  using a parallel rake of rays scanned across an axisymmetric flame @xcite .",
    "projections are subsequently deconvolved using a numerical implementation of abel s inversion equation @xcite .",
    "since abel inversion is an inherently ill - conditioned problem @xcite , small levels of measurement noise in projection data are amplified in the solution .",
    "therefore , deconvolutions are usually performed for coarse grid spacing @xcite and/or after artificial smoothing of projection data @xcite .",
    "available work on tomographic tdlas falls into two categories : tomography of axisymmetric domains ,  which is essentially 1d ,  and reconstructions of 2d slices using projections from multiple directions / views .",
    "another distinction can be made with respect to the number of spectral transitions being probed .",
    "two important prior studies on 1d tomographic tdlas are works by silver et al .",
    "@xcite and villarreal and varghese @xcite .",
    "both studies use traditional abel inversion to deconvolve los data and use relatively large beam spacing . while the experimental setup of the present study is a variation of the one used by villarreal and varghese @xcite , the previous study used 9 spectral transitions to simultaneously reconstruct temperature and concentration profiles using a scanned direct absorption method .",
    "silver et al .",
    "@xcite used wms-_2f _ to reconstruct concentration profiles of @xmath0 for a flame in microgravity .",
    "while this approach is nominally similar , the previous study decoupled measurements by a semi - computational approach : concentrations are found directly from lines with low temperature sensitivity , whereas corresponding temperatures are calculated .",
    "the present work , however , determines concentration ( mole fractions ) and temperature simultaneously and furthermore seeks to augment the performance of highly resolved abel inversion by the introduction of tikhonov regularization .",
    "an alternative approach is hyperspectral tomography , which was introduced in the context of 2d reconstructions @xcite . in this method ,",
    "los absorbance data are obtained for a large number of spectral transitions using a broadly tunable diode laser .",
    "the strength of this method is that the redundancy of spectral information allows for a reduction of views for a satisfactory reconstruction .",
    "furthermore , recent proof - of - concept computational work indicates that hyper - spectral las methods can be combined with wms-2f @xcite .",
    "hyper - spectral methods require frequency - agile lasers that allow for broad - band modulation . in 1d tomography ,",
    "the redundancy of spectral information is less critical ; as will be shown , a small number of inexpensive laser diodes with narrow modulation capability is sufficient .",
    "the goal of this study is to produce high resolution 1d reconstructions using tikhonov regularized abel inversion with two - transition wms-_2f _ tdlas , where experimental validations are performed for an axisymmetric mckenna burner .",
    "wms-_2f _ for species measurements dates back to at least the early 1990 s @xcite and has found application in a range of recent studies @xcite . compared to direct absorption ( da ) spectroscopy , wms-_2f _ has the advantage of producing a significantly higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this is achieved by detecting the harmonics at frequencies that are high enough to reject much of the low - frequency high - amplitude relative intensity noise @xcite that are typical in diode lasers . from an experimental point of view , wms-_2f _ is advantageous @xcite since the first harmonic signal can be used as an effective tool for normalizing any variation of the second harmonic signal ( calibration - free ) @xcite for optically thin samples .",
    "this approach is attractive , as it eliminates low - frequency noise and makes measurement independent of signal disturbances due to window fouling or beam walking .",
    "since temperature and concentration vary significantly within the domain , modulation depths for wms-_2f _ can not be universally optimized as is commonly done for homogeneous media @xcite .",
    "instead of a two - transition ratio technique with optimal modulation depths , temperature and mole fractions are simultaneously determined by using a levenberg - marquardt least squares algorithm with non - optimal modulation depths .",
    "a wavelength - modulated laser beam passing through a non - uniform temperature and concentration field is subject to path - integrated beam attenuation .",
    "the resulting signal can be deconvolved using traditional tomographic methods to produce local contributions to the beam attenuation .",
    "these values are then used to calculate temperature and mole fraction via a two - transition wms-_2f _ method .",

    "<S> experimental results show successful reconstructions of temperature and mole fraction profiles based on two - transition , non - optimally modulated wms-_2f _ and tikhonov regularized abel inversion , and thus validate the technique as a viable diagnostic tool for flame measurements . </S>"
