    "<S> the connectivity pattern of networks , which are based on a correlation between ground level temperature time series , shows a dominant dense stripe of links in the southern ocean . </S>",
    "<S> we show that statistical categorization of these links yields a clear association with the pattern of an atmospheric rossby wave , one of the major mechanisms associated with the weather system and with planetary scale energy transport . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that alternating densities of negative and positive links ( correlations ) are arranged in half rossby wave distances around 3,500 km , 7,000 km and 10,000 km and are aligned with the expected direction of energy flow , distribution of time delays and the seasonality of these waves . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that long distance links ( i.e. , of distances larger than 2,000 km ) that are associated with rossby waves are the most dominant in the climate network . </S>",
    "<S> climate networks may thus be used as an efficient new way to detect and analyze rossby waves , based on reliable and available ground level measurements , in addition to the frequently used 300 hpa reanalysis meridional wind data .    </S>",
    "<S> networks have become an important tool for analyzing technological and natural systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> examples range from social relations  @xcite , biochemical interactions  @xcite , information flow through the world wide web  @xcite , physiological activities  @xcite , and the mitigation of attacks on transportation infrastructures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was suggested in past years that climate variables , like temperature and geopotential height , can be viewed as a climate network  @xcite . in this representation , </S>",
    "<S> different regions of the world are regarded as nodes of the network , and links of the network represent communications between different locations via , e.g. , heat and material exchange . a multitude of statistical analysis methods are often used to capture major variability patterns in climate time series  @xcite , where the correlation matrix plays an important part . </S>",
    "<S> the climate network provides a complementary tool to study the statistical properties of the climate system .    </S>",
    "<S> the climate network often has very strong links which are caused by a proximity ( distance ) effect  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , pairs of sites close to each other below some threshold distance ( typically 2,000 km ) are often strongly positively correlated . </S>",
    "<S> a significant fraction of the stable network structure may be associated with the proximity effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is hence common to analyze climate time series also based on negative correlations ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which usually represent more interesting remote interactions , called teleconnections .    </S>",
    "<S> however , recent studies have not distinguished between positive and negative correlations in climate networks  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it is apparent , based on previous studies , that a large fraction of the links in the climate network resides in the southern ocean  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this fraction may include ( beyond the proximity effect distance ) both negative and positive correlations .    </S>",
    "<S> here we analyze separately the negative and positive correlations of the climate network . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these links alternate , as a function of distance , between negative and positive , consistent with a wave pattern . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the time delay associated with these links increases from one to five days as a function of the distance between the nodes ( the length of the links ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the typical length scale of the links , their seasonality , and the geographical structure of the climate network ; all of these are found here to be consistent with atmospheric rossby waves , one of the most efficient climate mechanisms of planetary - scale energy transfer  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> studies of atmospheric rossby waves are usually based on the 300 hpa meridional wind velocity reanalysis data  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to uncover the characteristics of rossby waves using more common and reliable surface data , like surface air temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that rossby waves dominate the climate network , an observation that , surprisingly , has not been previously reported .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the daily data of air temperature , sea level pressure , geopotential height , and meridional velocity fields . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we analyze a network of 726 nodes around the globe ( see  @xcite or small dots in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ) from the ncep / ncar reanalysis i grid  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below , we mainly focus on the surface temperature field as one of the most common and reliable types of data . for each node ( i.e. , longitude / latitude grid point ) of the network , </S>",
    "<S> daily values within the period 1948 - 2010 are used , from which we extract anomaly values . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , if we take the record of a given site in the grid to be @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the year and @xmath2 is the day ( from 1 to 365 ) , then the filtered record is denoted by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the number of years available in the record . </S>",
    "<S> we also define @xmath5 } \\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { { \\left [                  { { t_s}(d ) - \\left\\langle { { t_s}(d ) } \\right\\rangle }                \\right ] } { \\left\\langle { { { \\left ( { { t_s}(d ) -                            \\left\\langle { { t_s}(d ) } \\right\\rangle }                        \\right)}^2 } } \\right\\rangle } } } \\right .        \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace } { \\left\\langle { { { \\left ( { { t_s}(d ) -                    \\left\\langle { { t_s}(d ) } \\right\\rangle } \\right)}^2 } }        \\right\\rangle } } ^{{1 \\mathord{\\left/ { \\vphantom { 1 2 } } \\right .          \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace } 2}}}$ ] , where @xmath6 is the average of the time series .    </S>",
    "<S> the link between each pair of sites on the grid , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is calculated as the cross - correlation function @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the time lag and @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we define the time lag , @xmath12 , at which @xmath13 is maximal ( or minimal ) , as the time delay of a pair @xmath7 , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath7 is to the west of @xmath8 and the time lag is positive , the link direction is to the east . </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish between positive and negative link weights as follows @xmath14 and , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the maximum and minimum values of the cross - correlation function , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the mean and standard deviation , and the superscript @xmath1 denotes a specific year . typical time series and their cross - correlation functions are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in this sample , </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of a minimal ( negative ) cross - correlation function is much larger than the maximal value .        </S>",
    "<S> we implemented the above procedure for winter and summer time series , separately . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we calculate the cross - correlation functions of each pair of sites , where the data ranges from may 1st to aug . </S>",
    "<S> 31st ( 123 days ) for southern hemisphere ( sh ) winter ( northern hemisphere , ( nh ) summer ) or from nov . </S>",
    "<S> 1st to feb . </S>",
    "<S> 28th ( 120 days ) for sh summer ( nh winter ) . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a maximal time lag of 72 days and a time period of @xmath20 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation coefficient and the link weight are based on 12 months of data , in order to have sufficient statistics . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by `` gluing '' together three consecutive winters ( summers ) , such that the total number of months is 12 .                we analyze a near surface ( 1000 hpa ) temperature time series . </S>",
    "<S> first , we focus on the properties of link weight around the globe ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) for the months nov . to feb .. to identify the significant links we apply a shuffling procedure in which the order of the years is shuffled while the order within each year remains unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> this shuffling scheme is aimed at preserving all the statistical quantities of the data , such as the distribution of values , and their autocorrelation properties , but omitting the physical dependence between different nodes . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) and ( b ) depict the link weight statistics for the real and shuffled data . </S>",
    "<S> high negative mean link weight values exist in the probability density function ( pdf ) of the real data but are missing in the shuffled data , and therefore are not likely to occur by chance . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , high variability ( std . ) during different years of the time delays of links @xmath12 is also a signature of random behavior  @xcite ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the distribution of real data and shuffled data indicate that many significant negative links exist in the climate network ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a),(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain similar results for positive links and other fields ( not shown ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we divide the world into three geographical zones , the sh ( from 22.5 to the south pole ) , the nh ( from 22.5 to the north pole ) and the equator ( between 22.5 and 22.5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then calculate the ( geographical and temporal ) mean link weight @xmath21 as a function of the geographical distance of links , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that in the sh , there is a preferred distance of @xmath22 3,500 km and a much weaker one of @xmath22 10,000 km ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ) . in the nh region </S>",
    "<S> , we find a similar , weaker dependence , while in the equatorial region , there is no preferred distance ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> these preferred distances may be associated with atmospheric rossby waves  @xcite , which have a wavelength of @xmath22 7,000 km and which are known to be pronounced in the sh , weaker in the nh and absent in the equatorial region  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the negative peaks at 3,500  km and 10,000  km represent a 1/2 wavelength and a 3/2 wavelength of the observed rossby wavelength .     in the sh during ( a ) winter and ( b ) summer months . </S>",
    "<S> ( c),(d ) same as ( a),(b ) for positive links . </S>",
    "<S> the pdf of time delays @xmath12 of near negative ( blue squares , @xmath23 3,500 km ) , far positive ( red circles , @xmath23 7,000 km ) , and far negative ( pink diamonds , @xmath23 10,000 km ) weighted links , in the sh during ( e ) winter and ( f ) summer . </S>",
    "<S> the figure is based on the temperature field at 1000 hpa isobar.,scaledwidth=55.0% ]    to further consolidate the association of the observed pattern in the climate network with rossby waves , we compare the seasonality of this pattern with the known seasonal characteristics of rossby waves . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a)-(d ) , we plot the negative and positive weights of all sh links , for the winter and summer months separately . </S>",
    "<S> each point represents an average link weight @xmath24 over years versus its distance @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the negative weights , defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ2 ] ) , have a pronounced enhanced distribution of large weights for @xmath25 3,500 km during both summer and winter months , while for the sh summer months ( nov . to feb . ) , there is an additional preferred distance of @xmath22 10,000 km ( fig . 3 ( b ) ) , both in accordance with the 1/2 and 3/2 wavelengths of atmospheric rossby waves . </S>",
    "<S> around the full wavelength distance ( i.e. , @xmath26  km ) , we find , as expected , an enhanced distribution of large positive weights ( defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ equ1 ] ) ) ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( c),(d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , a larger abundance of strong waves ( represented by links at 1/2 , 1 , and 3/2 wavelengths ) during summer , in comparison to winter months , is clearly seen in fig . 3 ( a)-(d ) , in agreement with the clearer pattern of rossby waves found during the sh summer in the sh  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is similar in the nh ( not shown ) , for the nh winter . in the distribution of positive weights ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c),(d ) ) , one clearly sees the links that emerge around @xmath27  km due to the proximity effect mentioned in the introduction .    </S>",
    "<S> atmospheric rossby waves have a characteristic group velocity , and we now estimate it based on the climate network results shown above . to achieve this , </S>",
    "<S> we divide @xmath2 by @xmath28 for each link , under the assumption that @xmath28 is a good estimate for the underlying dynamical delay between the two sites ( nodes ) @xcite . since @xmath28 is only meaningful for links with weights above the background noise level ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , and ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , we limit the analysis to links with weights @xmath29  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , to avoid links that are prone to the proximity effect ( as such links can not easily fit in the current rossby wave interpretation ) , when considering positively correlated links , we consider links with @xmath30 km . </S>",
    "<S> also , we constrain the near negative links to be within @xmath31 $ ] and far negative links to have @xmath32 km . the pdfs of time delay @xmath28 of the near negative links , the far positive links and the far negative links are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(e),(f ) . by our convention , </S>",
    "<S> positive @xmath28 means an eastward energy flow , which is the typical case for most observed links . </S>",
    "<S> the results point to a time lag of @xmath33 1 day for the near negative links ( i.e. , links in the first peak in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) ) , @xmath34 2 - 3 days for the far ( beyond the proximity effect ) positive links , and @xmath33 3 - 4 days for the far negative links ( i.e. , belonging to the second peak in the scatter plot of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a , b ) ) . based on these numbers , </S>",
    "<S> our estimated group velocities are in the range @xmath35$]m / s , consistent with the range @xmath36$]m / s reported in previous studies  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> the climate network has a unique geographical structure that can be compared with the geographical structure of rossby waves . since the network is directed  </S>",
    "<S> positive @xmath10 indicates eastward flow while negative @xmath10 indicates westward flow  we distinguish between a link that is pointing toward a node ( where the number of links pointing to a specific node is referred to below as `` in - degree '' ) , or away from the node ( referred to below as `` out - degree '' ) ( see  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 depicts the mean in- and out - degrees of each node , excluding the equatorial region that conforms with a pattern that is not related to our current discussion . </S>",
    "<S> the observed structure is consistent with the structure of rossby waves  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first , the wave band in the sh from may to august ( sh winter , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(c),(d ) ) is broader than that of the sh summer ( nov . to feb . </S>",
    "<S> , fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( a , b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the atmospheric rossby wave structure in the nh summer is less pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> third , the wave structure in the sh summer ( nov . to feb . ) lies on a band centered near 50 . </S>",
    "<S> all the above characteristics are consistent with the properties of rossby waves .     in the sh during sh summer months for temperature ( left panels ) and meridional velocity ( right panels ) for 300 hpa ( upper panels ) and 1,000 hpa ( lower panels).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    previous studies found the 300 hpa meridional velocity field to be the most suitable for studying the characteristics of rossby waves @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our method captures the wave properties also using other fields at various altitudes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we showed above that the wave pattern is clearly seen at a ground level ( 1000 hpa ) temperature field , a more common and reliable variable . in fig . 5 , we compare , using the climate network technique , between the mean weight distributions of the negative links of the meridional velocity and temperature fields . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the pattern of the two fields is similar , although the meridional velocity yields larger weights . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the meridional velocity yields a clearer pattern at the high altitude of 300 hpa , while the temperature field yields a clearer pattern at the ground level of 1000 hpa .    in summary , we analyze the properties of the climate network by considering , separately , positive and negative correlations ( links ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most dominant links in the climate network with a geographical distance larger than 2,000 km are found for distances of @xmath22 3,500 km , @xmath22 7,000 km and @xmath22 10,000 km . </S>",
    "<S> these distances coincide with the 1/2 , 1 and 3/2 wavelengths of common atmospheric rossby waves . moreover , the time delays associated with these distances are in agreement with the direction of the energy flow and with the group velocity of the atmospheric rossby waves </S>",
    "<S> . the pronounced length scales of the climate network , the dominance in the sh in comparison with the nh , and the dominance during the sh summer in the sh are all consistent with the properties of atmospheric rossby waves . </S>",
    "<S> all of these factors thus provide strong support for the association of the majority of the climate network far links with rossby waves . </S>"
