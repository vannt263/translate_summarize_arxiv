    "it has recently been shown that the combined effect of gas drag and pressure gradients causes solid objects to rapidly migrate toward the location of maximum pressure in a gaseous nebula @xcite .",
    "such rapid migrations result in the accumulation of objects in the vicinity of local pressure enhancement and may increase the rates of their collisions and coagulations . in a disk with a mixture of gas and small solid particles , the motion of an object",
    "is also affected by its interaction with the particulate background . an object may , in such an environment , sweep up smaller particles and grow larger during its gas - drag induced migration . in this paper",
    "i present a summary of a study of the growth - rates of dust grains to centimeter - sized objects in a nebula with a local pressure enhancement .",
    "an isothermal and turbulence - free protostellar disk is considered here with a solar - type star at its center .",
    "the nebula is assumed to be a mixture of pure molecular hydrogen at hydrostatic equilibrium , and small submicron - sized solid particles .",
    "the density of the gas in this nebula is considered to be @xmath0 -\\beta\\bigl({r \\over{r_m}}-1 { \\bigr)^2}\\biggr\\}.\\ ] ] in equation ( 1 ) , @xmath1 is the mass of the central star , @xmath2 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the boltzmann constant , the gas temperature , and the molecular mass of hydrogen , respectively .",
    "the quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 in equation ( 1 ) are parameters of the system with constant values .",
    "the gas density function as given by equation ( 1 ) ensures that along the vertical axis , the gravitational attraction of the central star will be balanced by the vertical component of the pressure gradients @xcite .",
    "it also has azimuthally symmetric gas - density - enhanced regions on any plane parallel to the midplane . on the midplane ,",
    "the density of the gas maximizes at @xmath7 .",
    "the particles of the background material of a nebula are strongly coupled to the gas and their motions are only affected by the gas drag . for the submicron - sized particles considered here , the rate of the gas drag induced migration is so small that one can assume , at any position in the nebula , the gas and particle distribution functions are proportional .",
    "that is , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the distribution function of the background material .",
    "the solid - gas ratio @xmath10 is taken to be constant and equal to 0.0034 .",
    "for an object larger than the submicron particles of the background material , the above - mentioned gas - particle coupling is less strong . as a result ,",
    "the object moves faster than the background particles and may collide with them .",
    "such collisions may result in adhesion of the background particles to the moving object and increase its mass .",
    "the rate of change of the momentum of an object due to the sweeping up of the background material is proportional to the rate of the collision of the moving object with those particles . assuming the sticking coefficient is equal to unity , one can write , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the radius of the object and @xmath13 . quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 in equation ( 2 ) represent the velocities of the object and the particles of the medium . in writing equation ( 2 )",
    ", it has been assumed that , while sweeping up smaller particles , the density of the object remains unchanged and it stays perfectly spherical .",
    "it is important to emphasize that in this equation , the mass of the object , @xmath16 , and its radius , @xmath12 , are functions of time , and are related as @xmath17 equation ( 3 ) immediately implies @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the density of the object .    for small particles such as micron - sized and submicron - sized objects",
    ", one can replace @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the relative velocity of the object with respect to the gas .",
    "the radial , vertical and tangential components of this velocity are , respectively , given by @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , where the motions of gas molecules along the @xmath24-axis have been neglected .",
    "because the gas is at hydrostatic equilibrium , its angular velocity , @xmath25 , is slightly different from its keplerian value and is given by @xmath26 in this equation , @xmath27 is the pressure of the gas .",
    "an object in the model nebula considered here is subject to the gravitational attraction of the central star and the drag force of the gas .",
    "the equation of motion of an object in this nebula is , therefore , given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the position vector of the particle and @xmath30 { { \\bf v}_{\\rm { rel}}}\\ ] ] represents the drag force of the gas . in equation",
    "( 7 ) , @xmath31 is the collisional cross section between two hydrogen molecules and @xmath32 is their mean free path .",
    "the equation of motion of a particle and the growth equation ( 4 ) were integrated , numerically , for objects with initial radii ranging from 1 to 100 microns .",
    "the mass of the central star was chosen to be one solar mass , @xmath33 au , and @xmath34 g @xmath35 . the collisional cross section of hydrogen molecules , @xmath31 ,",
    "was taken to be @xmath36 , and their mean free paths @xmath37 . at the beginning of integrations ,",
    "an object was placed at @xmath38 , with a keplerian circular radial velocity and with no motion along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "figure 1 shows the growth of two one micron - sized objects , one migrating radially inward from ( 2,0.2 ) au , and one migrating radially outward from ( 0.25 , 0.025 ) au to ( 1,0 ) au , the location of the maximum gas density on the midplane . for the comparison ,",
    "the radial and vertical motions of these objects without mass - growth have also been plotted .",
    "as shown here , by sweeping up the smaller particles of the background , these objects grow to a few centimeters in size and approach the midplane in a time much shorter than the time of similar migration without the mass - growth .",
    "equations ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) were also integrated for different values of the object s density and gas temperature .",
    "as expected , the rate of growth of the object increased with an increase in the temperature of the gas ( fig .",
    "this can be attributed to larger value of the pressure gradients at higher temperatures @xcite .",
    "increasing the density of the object while keeping the temperature of the gas constant had , however , an opposite effect .",
    "objects with higher densities tend to grow in size over longer periods of time .",
    "the inverse proportionality of the rate of the growth of the object to its density can also be seen from equation ( 4 ) ."
