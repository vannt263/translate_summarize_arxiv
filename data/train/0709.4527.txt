    "up to now , the pairing symmetry of electron - doped high @xmath0 superconductor is still under debate , and various interpretations for experimental results are controversial .",
    "on one hand , the phase sensitive josephson junction experiments indicate d - wave pairing symmetry pairing,@xcite and meanwhile angle - resolved photoemission spectra ( arpes ) @xcite and electronic raman spectra@xcite suggest a non - monotonic d - wave energy gap as a function of momentum . on the other hand , tunnelling spectra@xcite and low temperature specific heat@xcite show more or less s - wave like behavior , i.e. the absence of zero bias conductance peak in the spectrum .",
    "two scenarios have been introduced to explain these results .",
    "one is the s - wave scenario , in which the s - wave character is regarded to be intrinsic , but it is incompatible with the phase - sensitive josephson junction experiment . the other one is the coexisting scenario in which the coexisting antiferromagnetic ( af ) order disguises the d - wave character of superconductivity ( sc).@xcite the idea is as follows .",
    "first of all , the in - plane af order has been observed by neutron scattering@xcite and transport experiments@xcite , and this af order should be considered naturally .",
    "further , since the af order opens a full gap in single particle excitation spectrum , which combines with the nodal d - wave sc gap to form an effective full single - particle gap . in a recent paper it is shown that a more careful analysis of the raman spectra could disentangle the effective gap into its af and pairing components.@xcite it remains to see whether a single - particle probe , such as the scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) could be used to identify the ingredients of the effective gap and thence differentiate the two scenarios .",
    "in fact , impurity in unconventional superconductors proves to be a useful tool to characterize various sc orders .",
    "for example , in a d - wave superconductor a zero energy impurity resonant state appears as a hallmark of the d - wave pairing symmetry . @xcite . on the contrary , in conventional s - wave superconductor the resonant states lie at the gap edge , which is known as yu - shiba - rusinov state.@xcite",
    "the drastic difference is due to the phase structure of the two sc orders : in the d - wave case the phase of pairing wave function changes sign across the nodal lines , while in s - wave case such no sign change occurs .",
    "mid - gap impurity resonant states can also occur in @xmath1 and @xmath2 superconductors.@xcite impurity resonant states can also be used to characterize the electronic structure in some materials.@xcite furthermore , it is also proposed that by inspecting the line - shape of the resonant peak as a function of temperature around a nonmagnetic strong impurity can differentiate the phase disorder scenario and d - density wave scenario of the pseudo - gap phase in hole - doped superconductors.@xcite therefore , stm measurements of the impurity states can provide important messages on the underlying system.@xcite the question we now ask is if af and d - wave pairing coexist , what is the nature of the impurity state , and in particular whether a low energy resonance state can still arise around the impurity .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the ldos around a nonmagnetic impurity in electron - doped high @xmath0 superconductor .",
    "our main results are as follows .",
    "firstly , although the af order gaps the quasi - particles and the bulk density of states is s - wave like , two mid - gap impurity resonant states , lying symmetrically at positive and negative energy , can be observed in the presence of a d - wave sc order .",
    "secondly , the two resonant peaks in ldos approach and cross each other when the impurity scattering strength increases up to the unitary limit . at an intermediate scattering strength the two peaks merge into one peak at the fermi energy .",
    "since such a mid - gap impurity resonant state does not exist in the s - wave scenario , the two scenarios for the electron - doped superconductor are differentiable by stm measurements of the nature of the low energy impurity states .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we describe the model and method . in section",
    "iii we present the results .",
    "first we obtained the phase diagram of the system in the absence of impurities .",
    "second , we discuss analytically a toy model with particle - hole symmetry to show the existence of impurity resonance states in the coexisting scenario .",
    "third , we switch back to the actual situation in the phase diagram , and calculate the ldos in the presence of a nonmagnetic impurity . in order to see the particular role of the coexistence orders , we compare the actual case to the cases with af or d - wave pairing alone .",
    "section iv is a summary of the work .",
    "we adopt the t - t-t-j model on a square lattice with the hamiltonian , @xmath3 here @xmath4 and @xmath5 are fermion operators subject the the non - double - occupancy constraint , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denote the first , second and third nearest neighbor pairs respectively .",
    "it should be noted that we work in the hole picture , so that a hole in the above model represents a physical electron - double - occupancy in electron doped cuprates . to cope with the above t - j model , we insist in calling the electron - double - occupancy as holon unless indicated otherwise . for the parameters we choose @xmath9 as the unit of energy , so that @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and spin exchange integral @xmath13.@xcite we emphasize that the choice of parameters are conventional , but our results are not sensitivity to the parameters .",
    "we apply the slave boson mean field theory ( sbmft ) , within which the projected fermion operator is decoupled to a spinon and a holon part @xmath14 , and the restriction of no double occupancy is replaced by the constraint @xmath15.@xcite in the mean field theory this operator constraint is replaced by its average counterpart .",
    "the holons are assumed to condense at zero temperature , so that @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the doping level .",
    "the spin - exchange term is decoupled in a standard way into hopping , pairing and spin - moment channels , @xcite @xmath18 here the bracket @xmath19 denotes mean value of an operator .",
    "@xmath20 is the hopping operator , @xmath21 is the singlet paring operator , and @xmath22 is the magnetic moment operator",
    ". the mean value of these operators are the corresponding order parameters .",
    "we introduce 4-spinors,_k=(f_ , f^_- , f_+q , f^_- - q)^tin the momentum space . here",
    "@xmath23 is the nesting vector .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian can be written in terms of the 4-spinors as @xmath24 , where the @xmath25 matrix @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean - field dispersion of the fermions , @xmath29 is the paring gap function in momentum space , which are given by , @xmath30\\\\ & & -4xt'\\cos(k_x)\\cos(k_y)-2xt''[\\cos(2k_x)+\\cos(2k_y)],\\\\ \\delta_{{{\\bf k}}}&&=-3/4j\\delta[\\cos(k_x)+\\cos(k_y)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the chemical potential to fix the doping level .",

    "the next step is to obtain the green s function in the presence of a single impurity .",
    "we model the impurity by a single - site potential located at the origin , and adopt the t - matrix formulation@xcite to calculate the perturbed green s function @xmath46 by g(_i , _j;z)=g_0(_i , _j;z ) + g_0(_i,0;z)t(z)g_0(0,_j;z),where t(z)= & & v_3+v_3g_0(0,0;z)t(z).here @xmath47 is the complex continuation of @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the nonmagnetic impurity potential , and @xmath50 is the third pauli matrix . in the t - matrix formulation",
    "the correction of mean - field order parameter induced by impurity is ignored .",
    "this was shown to be sufficiently consistent with a full self - consistent calculation.@xcite    finally , the ldos can be measured by stm directly , which is given by n ( ;)=-im[g_11(*r*,*r*;-+i)+g_22(*r*,*r*;+i)],[ldos]where @xmath51 denotes an infinitely small positive number .",

    "a typical result at doping level @xmath58 is shown as the inset of fig.[phasediagram ] .",
    "the u - shaped dos indicates the absence of node in single particle excitation spectrum , and have been observed in point contact tunnelling spectra but was interpreted as the character of s - wave pairing.@xcite in our case , it is a result of coexisting af and sc orders .",

    "we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the unperturbed on - site green s function @xmath64 can be calculated explicitly as , @xmath65 here the @xmath66 is the two by two unit matrix , and @xmath67 is the curie - wess potential .",
    "the t - matrix is given by @xmath68 .",
    "the position of the resonant state is given by @xmath69 .",
    "in the unitary limit @xmath70 the resonance condition is given by @xmath71.@xcite since the off - diagonal elements of @xmath72 is zero due to the d - wave pairing symmetry , the resonance occurs at @xmath73 .",
    "since the @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) component of @xmath46 describes particles ( holes ) , we see that another resonance should occur at @xmath76 in the particle picture alone .",
    "this is also evident from the two contributions in the expression for @xmath77 in eq.([ldos ] ) .",
    "if the impurity potential is finite , the situation is more complicated . in fig.[partiholesym ] we present the dependence of ldos on potential strength . in the calculation we simply set @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for illustration .",
    "the ldos is for site ( 0,1 ) , a nearest neighbor of the impurity site .",
    "when the potential strength is @xmath81 , there appears already two resonant peaks lying symmetrically at the positive and negative sides already .",
    "with increasing potential strength the resonant peaks shift toward the gap edges , and the height of peaks is strongly enhanced .",
    "similar phenomenon has been observed in the study of organic superconductivity with bond - dimmerization.@xcite in the next subsection we discuss how the resonance behaves in the realistic situation .",
    "( color online ) the same plot as fig.[partiholesym ] but for the actual cases described by the phase diagram.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in this subsection we discuss the realistic situation in electron doped cuprates .",
    "we choose the result of sbmft as the input of t - matrix formulation .",
    "the evolution of ldos at site ( 0,1 ) with impurity potential strength at the doping level @xmath58 is shown in fig.[actual ] .",
    "the mean field order parameters are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 .",
    "at first we note that in the unitary limit @xmath85 , there are two mid - gap resonant states lying symmetrically at the positive and negative energy , but the height of the two peaks are different due to the effect of coherence factor in @xmath86 , due to the particle - hole asymmetry in the present case .",
    "the two peaks are visible for @xmath87 . with increasing potential strength , we see that the two peaks seem to cross each other . for @xmath88",
    "the two peaks meet and merge into one peak which lies right at the fermi energy .",
    "it is therefore clear that resonance states do appear in the coexisting phase , even though the nodal d - wave gap is disrupt by the af gap .",
    "( color online ) the same plot as fig.[partiholesym ] but in pure af cases at two doping levels.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    ( color online ) the same plot as fig.[partiholesym ] but in pure d wave sc cases at two doping levels.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to understand the unique role of the coexisting orders , we compare the results in the pure d - wave case and the pure af order case .",
    "we set the d - wave sc order parameter to zero in ( [ bloch ] ) and leave the af order parameter unchanged for pure af order case .",
    "conversely , we set the af order to zero for pure d - wave case . in principle",
    "one should do the self - consistent calculation again in each case .",
    "we have done so but found no significant changes to the remaining order parameters .",
    "first , we consider the pure af case .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[afm](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath89 and @xmath58 , respectively . for @xmath89 ,",
    "the af order is strong enough to split the two bands , and impurity resonant peaks lie in the gap as well as outside the band . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the af order is weak and the two af - order - induced bands overlap , and then impurity resonant states ( the sharp peaks ) lie outside bands .",
    "the positions of resonant peaks move toward higher energy for higher potential strengths , and are pushed to infinity in the unitary limit .",
    "second we turn to the pure d - wave case shown in fig.[sc](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath89 and @xmath58 .",
    "we can identify two resonant peaks at the two doping levels in the unitary limit , but the strong particle - hole asymmetry has weaken the strength of peaks . on the other hand ,",
    "the two peaks never cross each other .",
    "moreover , for weak potential strength these peaks are indiscernible .    to close this section , we conclude by comparison that two well - defined mid - gap resonant peaks appear and cross each other with increasing impurity potential only in the coexisting phase with both af and d - wave sc order .",
    "in this work we discuss the impurity resonant state in the coexisting phase with d - wave sc and af orders .",
    "we demonstrate analytically the existence of mid - gap resonance states in a putative particle - hole symmetrical case , and present the results in the realistic case , where the resonance peaks can shift and switch with increasing potential strength . at an intermediate potential strength , the two peaks merge at the fermi level .",
    "these unique features do not appear in the separate pure af or pure d - wave pairing states .",
    "it is also know that mid - gap impurity states do not appear in a pure @xmath90-wave phase .",
    "thus , the impurity state can be used to differentiate the s - wave scenario and coexisting scenario .",
