    "<S> we constrain generic nonstandard neutrino interactions with existing experimental data on neutrino transition magnetic moments and derive strong bounds on tensorial couplings of neutrinos to charged fermions . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss how some of these tensorial couplings can be constrained by other experiments , e.g. , on neutrino - electron and neutrino - nucleus scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos have long been a prime vehicle for testing the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> they played instrumental role in measurements of parton distribution functions  @xcite , quark mixing parameters  @xcite and other important quantities . </S>",
    "<S> neutrino oscillations provided the first glimpse of the physics beyond the minimal standard model by establishing that neutrinos have mass  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would not be entirely surprising if other signs of new physics were revealed in the precision studies of neutrino properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore important to study deviations of neutrino interaction parameters with other sm particles from their sm expectations . </S>",
    "<S> there have been many analyses of nonstandard neutrino interactions , often abbreviated as nsis , in neutrino scattering and oscillation experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they have been particularly important in the studies leading up to a possible future neutrino factory . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we point out that it is possible to constrain nsis using existing measurements of neutrino transition magnetic moments .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been seen that nonstandard neutrino interactions play a subdominant role in neutrino scattering . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the scale of new physics @xmath0 is large compared to the electroweak scale , the easiest parameterization of nsis of @xmath1 type at low - energy scales accessible in neutrino experiments would naturally be written in terms of effective four - fermion operators of dimension 6  @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 are nsi couplings , @xmath4 denotes the component of an arbitrary weak doublet ( often an electron or a quark field for studies of @xmath5nsis in matter ) , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8/2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> effective nonstandard neutrino interactions , expressed by the four - fermion operators as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ efflgr ] ) , are widely discussed in the literature , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for recent reviews . </S>",
    "<S> typically only left - handed neutrinos are considered , which allows the study of nsis impact on solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrinos , as well as on neutrino - nucleus scattering . </S>",
    "<S> also , oftentimes , only left - handed or right - handed _ vectorial _ interactions are considered .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that this restriction removes from the consideration a large class of models in which neutrino interactions could violate lepton number , e.g. , models with leptoquarks and r - parity - violating supersymmetric theories . </S>",

    "<S> it is therefore important to consider an effective lagrangian that also includes tensorial interactions . the chirality constraint that allows @xmath1 interaction only of @xmath10 types can not describe possible important neutrino phenomena , such as neutrino magnetic moment ( nmm ) . </S>",

    "<S> currently , the strongest experimental bound on nmm is far from the sm value  @xcite , @xmath26 it has been obtained from the constraint on energy loss from globular cluster red giants , which can be cooled faster by the plasmon decays due to nmm  @xcite , which delays the helium ignition . </S>",
    "<S> this bound can be applied to all diagonal and transition nmms .    </S>",
