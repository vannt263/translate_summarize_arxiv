    "the study of semi - hard particle production in high energy hadronic interaction is dominated by interactions between partons having a small fraction @xmath0 of the longitudinal momentum of the colliding nucleons .",
    "since the phase - space density of such partons in the nucleon wave function is large , one expects that the physics of parton saturation @xcite plays an important role in such studies .",
    "this saturation generally has the effect of reducing the number of produced particles compared to what one would have predicted on the basis of pqdc calculation with parton densities that depend on @xmath0 according to the linear bfkl @xcite evolution equation .",
    "it was proposed by mclerran and venugopalan @xcite that one could take advantage of this large phase - space density in order to describe the small @xmath0 partons by a classical color field rather than as particles .",
    "more precisely , the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model proposes a dual description , in which the small @xmath0 partons are described as a classical field and the large @xmath0 partons act as color sources for the classical field . in their original model",
    ", they had in mind a large nucleus , for which there would be a large number of large @xmath0 partons ( at least @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the atomic number of the nucleus , from just counting the valence quarks ) and therefore they would produce a strong color source .",
    "this meant that one has to solve the full classical yang - mills equations in order to find the classical field .",
    "but that procedure , on the other hand , would properly incorporate the recombination interactions that are responsible for gluon saturation . in the mv model , the large @xmath0 color sources",
    "are described by a statistical distribution , which they argued could be taken to be a gaussian for a large nucleus at moderately small @xmath0 ( see also @xcite for a more modern perspective on that ) .    since then",
    ", this model has evolved into a full fledged effective theory , the so - called `` color glass condensate '' ( cgc ) @xcite .",
    "it was soon recognized that the separation between what one calls large @xmath0 and small @xmath0 , inherent to the dual description of the mv model , is somewhat arbitrary , and that the gaussian nature of the distribution of sources would not survive upon changes of this separation scale .",
    "this arbitrariness has been exploited to derive a renormalization group equation , the so - called jimwlk equation @xcite , that describes how the statistical distribution of color sources changes as one moves the boundary between large @xmath0 and small @xmath0 .",
    "this functional evolution equation can also be expressed as an infinite hierarchy of evolution equations for correlators @xcite , and has a quite useful ( and tremendously simpler ) large @xmath3 mean - field approximation @xcite , known as the balitsky - kovchegov equation .    in high energy hadronic collisions ,",
    "gluon production is dominated by the classical field approximation , and calculating it requires to solve the classical yang - mills equations for two color sources moving at the speed of light in opposite directions .",
    "this is a problem that has been solved numerically in @xcite for the boost - invariant case , and the stability of this solution against rapidity dependent perturbations has been investigated in @xcite . in terms of analytical solutions , much less is known .",
    "the only situation for which gluon production has been calculated analytically is the case where one of the two sources is weak and can thus be treated at lowest order ( this situation is often referred to as `` proton - nucleus '' collisions in the literature , but it can also be encountered at forward rapidities in the collision of two identical objects ) .",
    "this was done in a number of approaches @xcite .",
    "the last two references provide the solution of yang - mills equation in this asymmetrical situation , in the schwinger gauge ( @xmath4 ) and lorenz gauge ( @xmath5 ) respectively .",
    "more recently , balitsky has proposed an expansion in commutators of wilson lines , where at each order one treats the two projectiles symmetrically @xcite .",
    "although the solution in the lorenz gauge was fairly compact , it turned out that it displayed some oddities like the appearance of a wilson line containing the coupling constant @xmath6 instead of @xmath7 ( this of course disappeared at later stages from physical quantities ) .",
    "when applied to the production of quark - antiquark production in @xcite , it also led to a contribution in which the vertex producing the @xmath8 pair was located inside the nucleus , which is quite counter - intuitive .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the solution of the yang - mills equations in the light - cone gauge @xmath9 ( with the nucleus moving in the negative @xmath10 direction ) , and we find a much simpler solution ( not only the solution is simpler , but it is also much easier to obtain ) . in particular , the solution in the @xmath9 gauge presents none of the odd features encountered in the lorenz gauge .",
    "our central result , derived in section [ sec : prop ] , is in fact a formula that tells how a color field propagates on top of the gauge field of the nucleus .",
    "the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lc - prop ] ) in fact contain all the information which is needed in order to derive the solution of yang - mills equations and compute gluon production , which we perform as a verification in section [ sec : gluon ] . beyond the study of `` proton - nucleus '' collisions themselves , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lc - prop ] ) are an important building block for calculating higher order corrections in the weak source to the solution of yang - mills equations . and to a large extent , the complexity of this object finds its way into the solution of yang - mills equations .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine this object , and to find a gauge in which it is particularly simple . for the sake of comparison , we derive in appendix [ sec : lorenz ]",
    "the analogue of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lc - prop ] ) for the lorenz gauge , and they are much more complicated , as one expects .",
    "we assume that the nucleus is moving with a velocity very close to the speed of light , in the negative @xmath10 direction .",
    "thus , it can be described by the following density of color sources : @xmath11 some intermediate calculations may require to regularize the delta function by giving it a small width .",
    "when this is necessary , we replace @xmath12 by @xmath13 , where @xmath13 is a positive definite function normalized by @xmath14 and whose support is @xmath15 $ ] .    in this paper , we address the following question : knowing the gauge fields at @xmath16 , what are the gauge fields at @xmath17 , i.e. after having propagated through the nucleus ? finding the gluon propagator inside the nucleus amounts to solving this problem to linear order in the incoming gauge fields . in practice , we add to the gauge field @xmath18 of the nucleus a small perturbation @xmath19 , @xmath20 and we wish to find a linear relationship for this perturbation before and after the region where the nucleus lives , such as ( see figure [ fig1 ] )  : @xmath21    we work in the light - cone gauge @xmath9 .",
    "the covariant conservation of the color current reads : @xmath22-[d^i , j^i]=0\\ ; .\\ ] ] this equation can be solved by @xmath23 the first equation is allowed because all the color charges in our problem are moving in the negative @xmath10 direction .",
    "the second equation means that the color current @xmath24 associated to the nucleus is not affected by the incoming field would induce a color precession of @xmath24 . ] , and therefore this current @xmath24 can be `` hidden '' once for all in the gauge field @xmath18 of the nucleus .",
    "the yang - mills equations in this gauge read @xmath25=0 \\nonumber\\\\ & & [ d^-,\\partial^+a^-]-[d^i , f^{i-}]=j^- \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\partial^+f^{-i}+[d^-,\\partial^+a^i]-[d^j , f^{ji}]=0\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see that the first of these equations does not contain any time derivative ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "therefore , it can be seen as a constraint that relates the various field components at the same time .",
    "the gauge field of the nucleus alone is found by considering only the order zero in @xmath27 in the above equations .",
    "one can readily check that the following is a solution : @xmath28    in order to find the the linear relationship between the perturbation @xmath27 before and after the region where the color sources of the nucleus live , we must linearize the yang - mills equations in @xmath27 .",

    "but as a verification , it is interesting to solve explicitly the third equation for @xmath34 , and at the end to verify that the fields @xmath35 and @xmath34 do obey the constraint .",
    "the third equation leads to @xmath36 it is trivial to verify that the constraint that relates @xmath34 to @xmath37 would have given the same answer .    therefore ,",
    "if we denote @xmath38 and if we do nt write explicitly the @xmath39 and @xmath40 dependence , we have the following relations : @xmath41 these equations are the light - cone gauge expression of the linear relation we were looking for .",
    "analogous relations will be derived for the lorenz gauge in the appendix [ sec : lorenz ] .",

    "note that since the dalembertian @xmath61 is bounded inside the nucleus , the region @xmath62 does not contribute in the limit @xmath63 .",
