    "the simplest model for the universe is a spatially homogeneous , isotropic spacetime with a euclidian ( flat ) geometry .",
    "this simple model is consistent with observations , but leaves unaddressed the question of topology or the connectedness of spacetime .",
    "schwartzschild @xcite first noted the possiblitity of non - trivial topology for the universe even before einstein s discovery of his field equations . almost immediately after einstein s discovery , de sitter @xcite pointed out the the field equations did not constrain the topology .",
    "since general relativity provides no theoretical guidance , we turn to observations to constrain topology .",
    "observational tests of topology all rely on multiple imaging of distant objects .",
    "if the universe is multiply - connected with cell size smaller than the distance to some object , photons from that object can reach the observer via multiple paths . simply searching the sky for multiply - imaged point sources , e.g. quasars ,",
    "is problematic : since the travel time to each image is different , each image shows the same object at a different time",
    ". if source evolution is important , the multiple images may no longer be recognizable as such .",
    "the ideal source for topological tests would fill the whole sky with a pattern centered on the observer and emitted at a single time . the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is an excellent approximation to this ideal source .",
    "a number of authors have used the cmb to constrain the topology of the universe .",
    "these tests fall into two general categories .",
    "a compact topology can not support spatial structure with wavelength longer than the cell size .",
    "the cmb temperature anisotropy will thus be suppressed on angular scales larger than the ( projected ) cell size .",
    "the first category tests use the cmb power spectrum ( or its legendre transform , the 2-point correlation function ) to test for non - trivial topology .",
    "the cmb in fact shows significantly less power in the quadrupole and octopole than would be expected for a model based on higher - order moments .",
    "the discrepancy was first detected by the cosmic background explorer @xcite and verified at much high signal to noise ratio by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1-powerspectrum ] shows the angular power spectrum of the wmap first - year data compared to the best - fit @xmath2cdm model @xcite .",
    "models with compact topology @xmath3 provide a good match to the observed power spectrum , motivating tests of finite - universe models @xcite .",
    "the suppression of power on large angular scales is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the existence of a compact topology .",
    "the power spectrum is rotationally invariant , averaging over any phase information in the pattern of cmb anisotropy .",
    "such phase information must exist for compact topologies , and forms the basis for a second class of tests .",
    "a `` circles on the sky '' search @xcite provides a more stringent test for compact topologies .",
    "the cmb decoupling surface is a sphere centered on the observer .",
    "if the cell size is smaller than the distance to the decoupling surface , the multiple images of this sphere induced by a compact topology will intersect to produce patterns that match along circles .",
    "such circles are not observed , limiting the cell size @xmath4 for a wide class of models @xcite .",
    "additional tests are possible .",
    "compact topologies will not produce circles on the sky if the cell size is larger than the distance to the source , since the resulting images will not intersect .",
    "compact topologies with @xmath5 may still be distinguished using phase information . in this paper",
    ", we describe the correlations imposed on the microwave background by the topology .",
    "we use this formalism to compare the wmap first - year data to a model with cubic topology and derive constraints on the cell size @xmath6 .",
    "on large scales , the cmb temperature anisotropy is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational potential and @xmath9 is the radius of the decoupling surface .",
    "the potential has the harmonic expansion @xmath10 where @xmath11 reflects the density of states , determined by the topology .",
    "for an infinite universe , @xmath12 is continuous , while for a compact topology only discrete values @xmath13 are allowed , where @xmath14,@xmath15,and @xmath16 are integers and @xmath6 is the cell size in units of the conformal time to the decoupling surface @xcite .",
    "the cutoff in the discrete spectrum , @xmath17 , suppresses power on large angular scales .    in inflationary cosmologies ,",
    "the gravitational potential s @xmath18 are random gaussian variables with zero mean and the covariance @xmath19 we expand the corresponding temperature fluctuations @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is a bessel function of order @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0 s have zero mean . using eqn ( [ eq - phi - covar ] )",
    ", we find their covariance @xmath24 which is not necessarily diagonal .    in the limit of a flat open universe , @xmath25 and the orthonormality of the spherical harmonics yields @xmath26 for a compact topology ,",
    "the integral over the continuous variables @xmath27 becomes a sum over discrete @xmath28 with @xmath29 a triplet of integers .",
    "just as we break the continuous integration @xmath30 into magnitude and angular parts , we do the same for the discrete case : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the set of all possible magnitudes of the integer triplets @xmath33 and @xmath34 are all @xmath33 with magnitude @xmath35 .",
    "thus @xmath36 is the sum over magnitude and @xmath37 is , for each magnitude , the angular sum .",
    "for example , the first value in @xmath38 is @xmath39 with the corresponding @xmath40 containing the six vectors @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the next value in @xmath38 is @xmath44 and @xmath45 contains 12 vectors , each with @xmath46 in two places and @xmath47 in the third .",
    "writing the measure @xmath30 in this form , for compact topologies we have @xmath48 where @xmath49 the momentum @xmath50 is related to @xmath35 via @xmath51 .",
    "there is a great computational advantage for making this split in the sum .",
    "all the cosmology is contained in the magnitude sum while the topology is reflected in the sum for @xmath52 , which requires the lion s share of cpu time .",
    "when numerically evaluating eqn ( [ eq - alm - covar ] ) , we compute and store all the required matrices @xmath52 , which only depend on the relative ratios of the fundamental domain sizes @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . for this work ,",
    "we have assumed they are all the same and equal to @xmath6 . as we vary the rest of the model parameters , including the topology scale @xmath6 , we need only evaluate the factors in the first sum and use the stored matrices @xmath52 to complete the sum .    thus far , we have ignored contributions from the time evolution of the gravitational potential ( the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ) on large scales and from the boltzmann physics of the coupled photon - baryon fluid . on small scales . both effects may readily be included .",
    "the `` line - of - sight '' approach @xcite to computing the anisotropies for a flat open universe first calculates the ( scalar ) response function @xmath56 and then gives the ( diagonal ) covariance @xmath57 this suggests we can include the isw and acoustic effects of the plasma motion by writing covariance ( [ eq - alm - covar - form1 ] ) as @xmath58 with @xmath59 given by eqn ( [ split_eq ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath56 from cmbfast @xcite , by way of the program cmbeasy @xcite , along with the associated value of @xmath9 .",
    "equation [ eq - alm - covar ] gives the covariance of the temperature coefficients @xmath60 as a function of cosmological parameters and global topology .",
    "figure [ fig2-off - diag - power ] compares the diagonal elements to the off - diagonal elements for the case of a cubic topology . the total power on the diagonal , @xmath61 , reflects the content of power spectrum @xmath62 and is rotationally invariant .",
    "the off - diagonal power , @xmath63 , measures the correlations between the different angular scales and is generated by the global properties of the topology . for cell size @xmath6 less than twice the distance to the decoupling surface , the off - diagonal elements dominate .",
    "analyses based solely on the power spectrum thus ignore the main information content of the map .",
    "the off - diagonal correlations persist at larger cell size , but become increasingly less important .",
    "in contrast to the circles on the sky test , the off - diagonal correlations smoothly decrease past @xmath5 .",
    "the covariance matrix @xmath64 for the @xmath0 coefficients fully describes a cosmological model and topology .",
    "since the @xmath0 s are still gaussian variables , albeit now correlated , all higher moments are given in terms of their covariance .",
    "equation [ split_eq ] thus allows the rapid generation of simulated sky maps for a given topology . for a given topology scale @xmath6 and cosmology @xmath65 , we first compute the cholesky decomposition @xmath66 of the @xmath0 covariance matrix : @xmath67 . then if @xmath68 are a set of uncorrelated unit variance gaussian variables , we set @xmath69 to obtain the sky map @xmath70 . a `` circles in the sky '' test @xcite run on the resulting sky maps verifies that the algorithm correctly reproduces all features for compact topologies .",
    "the only remaining free parameter in our model is the overall amplitude of the fluctuations .",
    "we fix this by comparing the power spectrum for the compact model to that for an infinite universe with the same response function @xmath65 .",

    "the simulated maps correctly show the rise to the first doppler peak .",
    "since topological effects are most apparent on large scales , we take @xmath76 for all analyses in this paper .",
    "we compare data from the wmap first - year sky maps to a set of models with a cubic fundamental domains described by the cell size @xmath6 in units of the conformal time to the decoupling surface .",
    "we specialize to the case of a cubic topology , identifying opposing faces of the unit cell without twists or rotation , so that the topology is fully specified by the cell size @xmath6 . for each value",
    "@xmath6 we compute the likelihood @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is given by equation [ eq - alm - covar ] .",
    "we use temperature coefficients @xmath80 derived from the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map from the wmap first - year data release @xcite .",
    "this map reduces foreground emission at the cost of a complicated window function and instrument noise on angular scales @xmath81 .",
    "topology is important only at much larger angular scales .",
    "we limit the likelihood calculation to @xmath82 . on these scales ,",
    "the dominant uncertainty is cosmic variance ; effects from the instrument noise and beam profiles are negligible .",
    "the ilc map reduces foreground emission but does not eliminate it completely .",
    "we impose a cut in galactic latitude @xmath83 and compute the @xmath80 using unit weight for all pixels outside the cut .",
    "our results are stable as the cut is varied from 25 to 15 .",
    "the likelihood analysis includes off - diagonal correlations between different @xmath80 , and is not rotationally invariant .",
    "equation [ eq - alm - covar ] was derived for the case when the faces of the fundamental domain align with the data coordinate system .",
    "we must thus consider different possible orientations between the data and the unit cell of the topology .",
    "it does not matter whether we rotate the model or the data , so we rotate the data . in terms of the euler angles",
    "@xmath84 , we use the rotation matrix @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the wigner rotation functions .",
    "we apply the rotation on a grid of tbd possible orientations @xmath87 over the range @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath90 are uniformly distributed on the sphere while the azimuthal rotation @xmath91 is uniformly distributed over its range .",
    "since the fundamental domain for the topology is cubic , the noted range covers all possible orientations .    for a fixed cosmological model , the likelihood becomes a function of four parameters : @xmath92 one parameter specifying the size of the unit cell and three parameters specifying the orientation , where for clarity we have suppressed the @xmath93 subscripts . even in the absence of topological effects",
    ", chance alignments between the random @xmath0 can create non - zero correlations in a single realization .",
    "if the relative orientation of the data and model is held constant , the likelihood will approximate a normal distribution over an ensemble of cmb maps . selecting the maximum likelihood over many possible orientations of",
    "a _ single _ cmb map , however , selects the lowest @xmath94 at each cell size @xmath6 .",
    "if the data do not represent a model with compact topology , maximizing the likelihood over the ( now nuisance ) rotational parameters @xmath87 will select from the tail of the @xmath94 distribution ( eq . [ chisq_def ] ) , leading to a biased estimate for @xmath6 .",
    "the bias is unimportant for large @xmath6 where the scale is too large for the topology to break global isotropy , but becomes significant for @xmath95 where the off - diagonal terms begin to dominate ( fig .",

    "we quantify the effect of maximizing the likelihood over orientation using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we generate 1000 realizations of compact topologies at 51 different values of @xmath6 on a grid from @xmath96 to @xmath97 uniformly spaced in @xmath98 . for simplicity",
    ", we work directly with the @xmath99 coefficients to avoid the intermediate steps of generating sky maps , masking pixels near the galactic plane , and computing the @xmath99 from the un - masked pixels .",
    "we instead impose the galactic cut using the matrix @xmath100 which removes all power from the azimuthally symmetric region @xmath101 , where @xmath102 are the associated legendre functions .",
    "each realization thus generates a set of correlated @xmath99 @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the cholesky decomposition of the @xmath105 covariance matrix ( eq . [ eq - alm - covar ] ) and @xmath106 is a vector of zero mean , unit variance gaussian random variables .",
    "we select a grid uniform in @xmath98 because the topology effects the covariance matrix @xmath107 as @xmath108 .",
    "there is also the advantage of placing the infinite case at a finite distance from the region of interest , @xmath3 .",
    "a model with @xmath109 is nearly indistinguishable from @xmath110 .",

    "we test for the significance of this peak by comparing the wmap results to 1000 monte carlo simulations of an infinite flat universe .",
    "the simulations also peak at @xmath112 , demonstrating the bias incurred when maximizing over orientation .",
    "the wmap data fall near the mean of the simulations , suggesting that the data are consistent with an infinite universe . in this case , the orientation @xmath87 becomes a nuisance parameter .",
    "we may then marginalize over the nuisance parameter by averaging the likelihood over all orientations ( as opposed to selecting the best orientation ) .",

    "the covariance matrix explicitly includes the contribution from the integrated sachs - wolfe effect on large angular scales and the acoustic peaks at small scales .",
    "we separate the covariance into a piece dependent on the topology and a piece dependent on the cosmology . although the transfer functions @xmath65 for the cosmology assume isotropy in @xmath136-space , which is no longer exact for compact models , the effect is predominantly in the cosmology with negligible effect on the topology .",
    "the algorithm is sensitive both to the power spectrum of the data ( diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for different @xmath105 ) as well as the phase information contained in the off - diagonal elements . for cell size @xmath132 the off - diagonal elements are larger than the diagonal elements . a comparison of the data to topological models that utilizes only the power spectrum can produce false positives by ignoring the additional information in the off - diagonal elements .",
