    "the most striking discovery of the modern physics is that the current universe is not only expanding but also accelerating .",
    "the late time accelerated expansion of universe has been confirmed by sn ia observations ( riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) . observations also suggest that the had been a transition of universe from the earlier deceleration phase to current acceleration phase ( caldwell et al .",
    "the recent measurements of the cmb anisotropy and the observations from type ia supernovae demand a significant and positive cosmological constant ( perlmutter 1997 , fujii 2000 ) . also observations of gravitational lensing indicate the presence of a non - zero @xmath7 .",
    "+ the cosmological term @xmath7 and the gravitational coupling g are assumed to be constants in the einstein s theory of general relativity .",
    "however , alternative ideas about the variability of these parameters have been started long ago .",
    "the idea of variable g was first introduced by dirac ( 1937 ) , though dirac s arguments were based cosmological considerations not directly directly concerned with mach s principle . later on brans and dike ( 1961 ) formulated the scalar- tensor theory of gravitation which is based on the coupling between an adequate tensor field and a scalar field @xmath8 , having the dimension of @xmath9 .",
    "motivated by dimensional grounds with quantum cosmology , chen and wu ( 1990 ) have consider the variation of cosmological term as @xmath10 . however",
    ", a number of authors have argued in favour of the dependence @xmath11 .",
    "later on , arbab ( 2003 ) has investigated cosmic acceleration with positive cosmological constant .",
    "a positive cosmological constant helps overcome the age problem , connected on the one side with the high estimates of the hubble parameters and with the age of the globular clusters on the other .",
    "further , it seems that in order to retain the cold dark matter theory in the spatially flat universe most of the critical density should be provided by a positive cosmological constant ( efstathiou el al 1990 , kofman et al 1993 ) .",
    "observational data indicates that the cosmological constant , if nonzero , is smaller than @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "however , since everything that contributes to the vacuum energy acts as a cosmological constant it can not just be dropped without serious considerations .",
    "moreover particle physics expectations for @xmath7 exceeds its present value by the factor of order @xmath14 i. e. in a sharp contrast to observations . to explain this apparent discrepancy",
    "the point of view has been adapted which allow the @xmath7-term to vary with time ( salim and waga 1993 , matyjasel 1995 ) .",
    "the idea of that during the evolution of universe the energy density .",
    "the idea of that during the evolution of universe the energy density of the vacuum decays into the particles thus leading to the decrease of cosmological constant . as a result one has the creation of particles although the typical rate of the creation is very small .",
    "+ an anisotropic bianchi type v cosmological model plays a significant role in understanding the phenomenon like formation of galaxies during its early stage of evolution .",
    "the choice of anisotropic cosmological models permit one to obtain more general cosmological model in comparison to frw model .",
    "theoretical arguments and recent observations of cmbr support the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one .",
    "therefore , it makes sense to consider the models of universe with anisotropic background in presence of gravitational coupling @xmath15 and cosmological term @xmath7 . among different anisotropic",
    "cosmological models bianchi type v universe is natural generalization of the open frw model . lorentz ( 1981 , 1985 )",
    "investigated tilted bianchi type v cosmological model with matter and electromagnetic field in higher dimensions .",
    "a large number of authors have studied bianchi type v cosmological model in different contexts ( beesham 1986 ; benerjee and sanyal 1988 ; nayak and sahoo 1989 , 1996 ; coley 1990 ; singh and singh 1991 ; coley and dunn 1992 ; pradhan and rai 2004 ) .",
    "singh and chaubey ( 2006 ) have considered a bianchi type v universe initially for self consistent system of gravitational field with a binary mixture of perfect fluid and dark energy given by a cosmological constant .",
    "further they have studied the evolution of a homogeneous anisotropic universe filled with viscous fluid , in the presence of cosmological constant @xmath7 ( 2007 ) .",
    "singh and kale ( 2009 ) and recently yadav et al ( 2012 ) have discussed anisotropic bulk viscous cosmological models with variable @xmath15 and @xmath7 .",
    "+ in this paper , we present the model of transit universe with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . to study the transit behaviour of universe , we assume the scale factor as an increasing function of time which generates a time dependent deceleration parameter ( dp ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the model and field equations have been presented .",
    "section 3 deals with the scale factors and cosmological parameters .",
    "finally conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we consider the space - time admitting bianchi type - v group of motion in the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the scale factors in x , y and z directions and @xmath20 is a constant .",
    "+ the average scale factor @xmath21 and spatial volume of bianchi - type v metric are given by @xmath22 @xmath23 the generalized mean hubble s parameter @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the directional hubble s parameters .",
    "an over dot denotes differentiation with respect to cosmic time t. + since metric ( [ eq1 ] ) is completely characterized by average scale factor therefore let us consider that the average scale factor is increasing function of time as following @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are constant .",
    "it is important to note here that the ansatz for scale factor generalized the one proposed by yadav ( 2012a , 2012b ) and pradhan @xmath33 amirhashchi ( 2011 ) .",
    "yadav ( 2012a , 2012b ) considered string and bulk viscous fluid as source of matter to describe the transit behaviour of universe whereas pradhan @xmath33 amirhashchi ( 2011 ) studied dark energy model with variable eos parameter . in this paper , we considered cosmic fluid filled with @xmath0 and @xmath1 as source of matter to describe the transition of universe from early decelerating phase to current accelerating phase . + the value of dp ( q ) for model ( [ eq1])is found to be @xmath34 equation ( [ eq6 ] ) clearly indicates the time varying nature of dp ( q ) .",
    "amendola ( 2003 ) and riess et al ( 2001 ) found that the expansion of universe is accelerating at present epoch but it was decelerating in past and the transition redshift from decelerated to present accelerated expansion is about 0.5 .",
    "it is however possible to have @xmath35 in equation ( [ eq5 ] ) for which we would have inflationary universe .",
    "the sign of @xmath36 indicates whether the model inflates or not .",
    "a positive sign of @xmath36 i. e. @xmath37 $ ] corresponds to standard decelerating model whereas the negative sign @xmath38 indicates the inflation .",
    "+ the einstein s field equations read as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the energy momentum tensor and it is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy density , @xmath43 is the isotropic pressure of the cosmic fluid , and @xmath44 is the fluid four velocity vector . in co - moving system of co - ordinates",

    "finally the generalized conservation equation can be obtained by using equations ( [ eq9 ] ) - ( [ eq11 ] ) in the differentiated form of equation ( [ eq12 ] ) and can be written , in the form @xmath56 + 8\\pi \\rho \\dot{g } + \\dot{\\lambda } = 0\\ ] ] we assume that the conservation of energy momentum tensor of matter holds @xmath57 leading to @xmath58 leaving @xmath15 and @xmath7 as some kind of coupled fields @xmath59",

    "thus the derived model approaches to isotropy at present epoch .",
