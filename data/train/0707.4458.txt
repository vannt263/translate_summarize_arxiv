    "in finite dimensions , the poincar recurrence theorem can be proved from the basic properties of a finite measure . in infinite dimensions , it is difficult to establish a natural finite measure , especially by extending a finite dimensional finite measure .",
    "a natural alternative is the banach norm which can be viewed as a counterpart of the probability density .",
    "an interesting problem is to study the poincar recurrence problem for 2d euler equation of fluids @xcite .",
    "nadirashvili @xcite gave an example of poincar non - recurrence near a particular solution of the 2d euler equation defined on an annular domain .",
    "the proof in @xcite was fixed up in @xcite .",
    "we believe that the poincar recurrence will occur more often when the 2d euler equation is defined on a periodic domain .",
    "the theorem to be proved in this article is a result along this line . on a periodic domain , the 2d euler equation is a more natural hamiltonian system than e.g. on an annular domain .",
    "one final note is that any solution of the 2d euler equation defines a non - autonomous integrable hamiltonian two dimensional vector field @xcite .",
    "the trajectories of this vector field are the fluid particle trajectories .",
    "this is the so - called lagrangian coordinates .",
    "the integrability was proved in the usual extended coordinates of two spatial coordinates , the stream function , and an extra temporal variable . due to the extra temporal variable ,",
    "most of the invariant subsets are of infinite volume . only in special cases",
    "e.g. the solution of the 2d euler equation is periodic or quasi - periodic in time , one can find invariant subsets of finite volume .",
    "this indicates that in the lagrangian coordinates , recurrence is a rare event @xcite .",
    "in finite dimensions , our theorem is a result of a simple compactness argument .",
    "but it states some interesting fact . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "the compactness argument is more complicated .",
    "let @xmath3 be a map and @xmath4 be a compact invariant subset .",
    "then for any @xmath5 and any @xmath6 , there is a @xmath7 such that @xmath8 where @xmath9 is an infinite sequence of positive integers and @xmath10 is the open ball of radius @xmath11 centered at @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13 is an open cover of @xmath4 , thus there is a finite subcover @xmath14 . for any @xmath15 ; @xmath16 ; thus @xmath17 for some @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , there is at least one @xmath18 such that an infinite subsequence of @xmath19 is included in @xmath20 .",
    "the theorem is proved .",
    "of course the theorem is still true when replacing @xmath21 by a banach space or a topological space .",
    "but compactness is a very restricted concept in infinite dimensions .",
    "the 2d euler equation @xmath22 is globally well - posed in @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) where @xmath23 is the 2-tori .",
    "we also require that @xmath24 denote by @xmath25 the vorticity , @xmath26 . a well - known fact is the following lemma .      by the incompressibility condition , @xmath28 dx = -2 \\int_{\\mathbb{t}^2 } ( { \\partial}_1u_1)({\\partial}_2u_2 ) dx.\\ ] ] since @xmath29",
    "dx   \\\\ & & = \\int_{\\mathbb{t}^2}\\left [ { \\partial}_1(u_1{\\partial}_2u_2 ) - { \\partial}_2(u_1{\\partial}_1u_2)\\right ] dx = 0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we have @xmath30 dx   \\\\ & = & \\int_{\\mathbb{t}^2}\\left [ ( { \\partial}_2u_1)^2+({\\partial}_1u_2)^2 - 2({\\partial}_1u_1)({\\partial}_2u_2)\\right ] dx   \\\\ & = & \\int_{\\mathbb{t}^2}\\left [ ( { \\partial}_2u_1)^2+({\\partial}_1u_2)^2 - 2({\\partial}_2u_1)({\\partial}_1u_2)\\right ] dx   \\\\ & = & \\int_{\\mathbb{t}^2}{\\omega}^2 dx . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using fourier series , one can prove this lemma by direct calculation : @xmath31 \\frac{1}{|k|^4}{\\omega}(k)^2 \\\\ & = & \\sum_{k \\in { \\mathbb{z}^2/\\{0\\}}}{\\omega}(k)^2 = \\int_{\\mathbb{t}^2 } { \\omega}^2 dx . \\quad \\box\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        in a simpler language , an enstrophy ball is compactly embedded in the kinetic energy space .",
    "this lemma is the well - known rellich lemma . in the @xmath23 setting",
    ", we will present the proof .",
    "there are many versions of the lemma and its proof .",
    "we follow that of @xcite .",
    "@xmath39    by lemma [ vde ] , @xmath40 let @xmath41 be a sequence in @xmath38 . for any @xmath42 , choose @xmath43 such that @xmath44 for any @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the fourier coefficients @xmath47 is a bounded set ( e.g. bounded by @xmath48 ) .",
    "therefore there is a convergent subsequence @xmath49 . for a different @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 is a bounded set again , thus there is a further convergent subsequence .",
    "iterating on all such @xmath18 ( @xmath46 finitely many ) , one can find a subsequence @xmath52 such that @xmath53 is uniformly convergent for @xmath46 .",
    "this is a simpler version of the usual diagonal argument .",
    "next we show that @xmath52 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath54 the second term is less than @xmath55 .",
    "the first term is less than @xmath56 when @xmath57 and @xmath58 are sufficiently large since @xmath53 is uniformly convergent for @xmath46 .",
    "so @xmath52 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath36 , and is convergent inside the closure of @xmath38 in @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath59 be a sequence of the accumulation points of @xmath38 in @xmath36 .",
    "then we can find a sequence @xmath41 in @xmath38 such that @xmath60 let @xmath52 be the convergent subsequence , then @xmath61 is also a convergent subsequence .",
    "thus the closure of @xmath38 in @xmath36 is a compact subset of @xmath36 .    for any @xmath62 ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "any @xmath6 , and any @xmath63 ; there is a @xmath64 such that @xmath65 where @xmath9 is an infinite sequence of positive integers , and @xmath66 is the evolution operator of the 2d euler equation .",
    "choose the @xmath67 in lemma [ compe ] to be @xmath68 define two sets : @xmath69 notice that @xmath70 is invariant under the 2d euler flow , and @xmath70 is a dense subset of @xmath38 , @xmath71 .",
    "by lemma [ compe ] , the closure of @xmath38 in @xmath72 is a compact subset . for any @xmath73 , denote by @xmath74 all these balls",
    "@xmath75 is an open cover of the closure of @xmath38 in @xmath2 .",
    "thus there are finitely many @xmath76 and @xmath77 is a finite cover . since @xmath70 is dense in @xmath38 , for each such @xmath78 , one can find a @xmath79 such that @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the sobolev space with norm @xmath82 still covers @xmath38 , thus covers @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath83 , @xmath84 then @xmath85 by the invariance of @xmath70 under the 2d euler flow @xmath66 .",
    "there is at least one @xmath86 such that an infinite subsequence of @xmath87 is included in @xmath88 .",
