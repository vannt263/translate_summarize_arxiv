    "di - hadron correlation measurements in heavy ion collisions using a single high-@xmath0 trigger have observed broader distributions of associated hadrons on the away - side azimuthal ( @xmath4 ) @xcite in heavy ion collisions relative to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and a long - range @xmath7 plateau called ` ridge ` at near - side ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "however , they do nt identify the away side jet which may endure more jet - medium interaction . on the other hand , two high-@xmath0 hadron correlations exhibit jet - like peaks in both near-/away - sides @xcite with little shape modification from d+au to central au+au , but a strong suppression on the away - side amplitude .",
    "the data may be interpreted in two scenarios : in - medium energy loss followed by in - vacuum fragmentation , and finite probability to escape the medium without interactions .",
    "the analysis in this paper uses a new 3-particle ( @xmath9 ) correlation technique , which measures the correlation of low-@xmath0 particle with a pair of back - to - back high-@xmath0 trigger pair as proxy of di - jets .",
    "the asymmetry between the two triggers @xmath0 are varied as an attempt to control the path length each parton travels in the medium , thus the difference between their final energy .",
    "this paper is based on data collected by the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) experiment @xcite in the years 2003 - 2004 and 2007 - 2008 of collisions events center - of - mass per nucleon pair energy of 200 gev , of both d+au and au+au .",
    "the au+au data are divided into multiple centrality bins based on the charged track multiplicity at mid - rapidity ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath11 ) and the number of binary collisions ( @xmath12 ) for each centrality bin used in the analysis are calculated via monte - carlo glauber model .",
    "the high-@xmath13 trigger pairs are required to be back - to - back @xmath14 to work as proxy of dijets .",
    "the associated hadrons 1.5  gev/@xmath2  @xmath15 ) is selected to coincide with the range where the broad away - side and the near - side ridge are reported .",
    "the correlation functions are defined as    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the number of trigger pairs , and @xmath18 is the associated hadron distributions corrected by @xmath19 for single - track efficiency and pair acceptance effects .",
    "the background @xmath20 is estimated from mixing - event technique after being modulated by the flow @xcite .",
    "the background due to randomly associated triggers as di - jets @xcite is also considered from trigger - trigger correlation in a similar way .",
    "the overall background level @xmath21 is then decided with the zero - yield at minimum ( zyam ) method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 spectra for associated hadrons is measured within 0.5  radians in @xmath22 and 0.5 in @xmath7 of the respective trigger direction , with background removed .",
    "the systematic uncertainties from all sources and items above are evaluated .",
    "their sums are highest in central au+au events ( < 20% ) and much lower in d+au and peripheral au+au , and strongly correlate between same-/away - sides and mostly cancel out for such comparisons .    the symmetric trigger work shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1_2plus1_paper ] is from most recent star 2 + 1 correlation publication @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath7 projections ( symmetrized about 0 ) of the correlation function are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure1_2plus1_paper]@xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "this measurement constitutes the first observation of not only the near - side , but also the away - side correlation structure in central au+au reproducing those of d+au as a reference ( without hot quark matter ) , in both @xmath22 and @xmath7 , for the associated hadrons in this kinematic range .",
    "no evidence of ` dip ` or ` ridge ` is present .",
    "however , statistical limitations prevents a complete exclusion of ridge @xcite . the similarity between au+au and d+au",
    "is further supported by their associated hadron @xmath0 spectra plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure1_2plus1_paper]@xmath2 , on contrary to previous di - hadron correlations measurments in a similar kinematic range , where significant softening of the away - side spectra is observed @xcite indicating energy deposition in the medium .",
    "the jet energy is then estimated by summing the @xmath0 of trigger and charged associates spectra . the result in the 12% central au+au data @xmath25",
    "gev/@xmath2 , similar to the minimum bias d+au data value of @xmath26  gev/@xmath2 . this number is close to the initial state kinematic effects 1.6  gev/@xmath2 @xcite and disfavors additional partons losing energy into medium in au+au case . as a conclusion , the @xmath9 results are consistent with lack of medium - induced effects on those di - jets selected by this analysis , and favors a surface jet emission model .",
    "this model is then tested by measuring the nuclear modification factors @xmath27 ( ratio of binary - scaled per - event trigger counts in au+au and d+au data ) for the primary ( single ) triggers and di - jet triggers as shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2_2plus1_paper]@xmath23 .",
    "a monte carlo glauber model based on surface emission is applied , assuming the medium in heavy - ion collisions consists of a completely opaque core ( full jet absorbtion ) surrounded by a permeable corona ( no jet - medium interactions ) .",
    "the relative size of the core is estimated from the @xmath28 of single triggers @xcite because they are purely from the corona and bypass the core in this model .",
    "the calculation is shown in fig.[figure2_2plus1_paper]@xmath24 .",
    "the model then calculates the conditional survival probability of di - jets @xmath29 and compares with the experimental data , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2_2plus1_paper]@xmath2 .",
    "the data are symbol points , and the expected rates from core / corona model are shown as a band , where the width reflects the uncertainty in the published @xmath28 data .",
    "they agree with each other qualitatively .",
    "however , core emission where neither of the di - jets interacted with the medium can not be ruled out by this analysis .    as for the path - length dependent energy - loss models where in - medium energy loss followed by in - vacuum fragmentation , trigger pairs of similar @xmath0 can possibly bias towards partons travel similar path length of medium and lose similar energy .",
    "thus highly asymmetric trigger pairs in @xmath0 are selected as proxy of di - jets of big asymmetry in energy loss .",
    "the primary triggers are bemc tower clusters of @xmath30  gev dominated by decayed @xmath31s .",
    "the direct@xmath32s contamination is non negligible @xcite but wo nt affect the validity of comparison , as direct@xmath32s do nt lose energy in the medium and away - side parton will lose relatively more energy if path - length dependence stands .",
    "the correlations are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure3_asymmetric_trigger ] @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "similar jet - like peak shapes and magnitudes sustain from d+au to central au+au collisions at both same-/away - sides .",
    "again , no evident ridge or dip structure is observed in au+au data . the away - side magnitude is higher than near - side in both au+au and d+au , which can be due to either the direct-@xmath33 contamination in primary trigger , or momentum conservation at lower-@xmath0 trigger ( away-)side if back - to - back jets are of similar energy .",
    "on the other hand , such difference varies little from d+au to au+au , indicating no evidence of asymmetry in energy loss of surviving parton pairs expected from path - length dependence model @xcite .",
    "the ratios of au+au associates spectra at either trigger side divided by d+au are plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure3_asymmetric_trigger]@xmath2 .",
    "these ratios are consistent with flat and close to unity at either trigger side , showing no evidence of softening or strong suppression , and further supports the assumption of strong surface - bias whenever a jet - like structure is observed .",
    "the mechanisms of jet - medium interactions was investigated using a novel technique called @xmath9 correlations , studying low-@xmath0 hadrons associated with a correlated pair of back - to - back high @xmath0 particles as proxy of di - jets .",
    "both same-/away - side correlations are found similar from d+au to central au+au data , and so is the associated hadron spectra on each trigger side , in the kinematic range selected of @xmath34  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the path - length dependence energy loss models expect that in either symmetric or very asymmetric trigger pairs cases such similarity shall be broken for di - jets if they are from deep within the medium ( non - tangential ) , which was nt observed at this stage of analysis within the errors",
    ". meanwhile , systematic assessment of di - jet production rates supports tangential emission bias in a simplistic core / corona scenario ."
