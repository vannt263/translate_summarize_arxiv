    "for the exploration of cosmology and gravitational physics , it is necessary to have a deep understanding of quantum filed theory in curved spacetime : it is widely believed that everything except for the spacetime itself should originate from quantum fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "quantum effects on curved spacetime , such as the hawking radiation , give us theoretical support for black hole thermodynamics .",
    "however , it is extremely hard to verify such quantum effects experimentally .",
    "for instance , the hawking radiation is thermal radiation emitted from a dynamically formed stationary black hole @xcite .",
    "however , the characteristic temperature of the thermal radiation , the hawking temperature , is on the order of several tens of nanokelvins at most , which is much lower than the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature .",
    "so detecting thermal radiation from a real black hole is almost impossible .    one way to circumvent",
    "this difficulty is to make use of artificial black holes @xcite@xcite .",
    "unruh showed in his seminal paper@xcite that excitations in a supersonic flow corresponds to a scalar field equation on a curved spacetime including a horizon .",
    "since the phenomenon of the hawking radiation can be separated from gravitational physics , it is possible to detect the corresponding phenomenon in a fluid system with sonic horizon @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to identify fluid flow with curved spacetime and excitation modes with fields on the curved spacetime .",
    "a black hole event horizon corresponds to a sonic horizon in a fluid . for the purpose of investigating the quantum effects ,",
    "a quantum fluid should be considered .",
    "as such a quantum fluid , bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in trapped cold atoms @xcite are one of the most suitable systems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a crucial advantage is that one can control scattering length between atoms by making use of the feshbach resonance@xcite .",
    "in fact , that experimental technique was used in observing jets and bursts in a collapsing condensate , which is called  bose - novae \" @xcite .",
    "an remarkable explanation of burst and jet phenomena in bose - novae was proposed in  @xcite@xcite , based on quantum field theory of particle creation and structure formation in cosmological spacetime .    in order to verify the hawking effect in fluid analogy ,",
    "it is necessary to create a stationary sonic horizon because it is a phenomenon on a dynamically formed stationary black hole .",
    "although several possibilities have been discussed so far @xcite , it seems difficult to realize exactly stationary sonic horizon in cold atoms .",
    "however , if one can make a quasi - static horizon for high frequency modes , particle emission from the horizon is also expected . in this paper , we numerically demonstrate that a quasi - static horizon is realized without introducing new experimental techniques beyond currently available ones .",
    "we consider an expanding bec driven by a sudden change of the interaction . numerically solving the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation ,",
    "we show that a quasi - static horizon appear .",
    "we note that there have been made great efforts to create cosmological geometry using expanding bec@xcite-@xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the analogue models with specific cosmological metrics such as friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric or de sitter metric were discussed and the effects of particle creation in these cosmological spacetimes were investigated . however , in this paper , we do not intend to obtain any cosmological analogue model with well - known analytic metric .",
    "but we try to obtain dynamically formed quasi - static sonic horizon .",
    "furthermore , the sonic horizon should be formed in hydrodynamic regime of the condensate because the spacetime analogy is only valid in such regime .",
    "the appearance of a horizon due to expansion of a condensate was noticed in the previous works , for example in @xcite , and its formation itself is not surprising .",
    "but it is non - trivial whether the condensate flow at the horizon is in the hydrodynamic regime , or not . in this paper , we show that the quasi - static sonic horizon will appear in the hydrodynamic regime of the condensate by changing the atomic interaction instantaneously .",
    "in the coherent state path integral formulation , the action of bosons is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the confining potential and @xmath2 with @xmath3 the @xmath4-wave scattering length .",
    "for @xmath5 and @xmath1 , spatial and time dependences are implicit .",
    "the saddle point equation for this action leads to the gp equation : @xmath6 this gp equation governs the dynamics of the condensate whose order parameter is given by @xmath7 .",
    "now we consider hydrodynamical approximation .",
    "we denote the bosonic field @xmath5 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the amplitude and the phase of @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "( namely , @xmath11 . )",
    "the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 describe the non - condensate part of the bosonic field . if the density gradient is sufficiently smooth over the scale determined by the local healing length @xmath14 , or , in other words if the conditions , @xmath15 are satisfied , hydrodynamical approximation is justified .",
    "( the condition ( [ eq : condition - healing ] ) shall be examined later . ) under the above condition , the equation for @xmath12 is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the background fluid velocity , and the effective action for @xmath13 is @xmath18.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking variation with respect to @xmath13 , we find that the field equation for @xmath13 has the form of a propagating wave equation .",
    "also , the equation for the field @xmath13 can be expressed as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the inverse of the following matrix : @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus , the equation is equivalent to an equation for a massless field on a curved spacetime determined by the metric ( [ eq : effectivemetric ] ) with @xmath24 the speed of `` light . ''",
    "note that in order to interpret the quantity @xmath24 as a velocity , @xmath25 must be positive because , for negative @xmath25 , @xmath24 becomes pure imaginary .",
    "hereafter we consider positive @xmath25 , which leads to an effective spacetime with lorentzian signature .",
    "for the excitation modes of @xmath13 whose frequencies , say @xmath26 , are much higher than the frequency @xmath27 , which is associated with the condensate motion , the condensate will be quasi - static .",
    "( for moderate changes of the interaction , @xmath27 turns out to be the trapping harmonic potential frequency @xmath28 , as shall be discussed below . )",
    "the analogy between fields on the curved spacetime and excitation modes on the fluid flow is meaningful only when the conditions ( [ eq : condition - healing ] ) are satisfied .",
    "the latter condition in eq.([eq : condition - healing ] ) turns out to be @xmath29 , by using eq.([eq : rho - varphi ] ) .",
    "thus , the frequency @xmath26 has an upper limit . the former condition in eq.([eq : condition - healing ] )",
    "is satisfied in the regions far from the edge of the condensate .",
    "( in contrast , if one is very close to the edge , zero - point oscillations become dominant , and so the former condition in ( [ eq : condition - healing ] ) is not satisfied . ) if there exists intermediate region for @xmath26 of @xmath30 then the hydrodynamical approximation is justified and the condensate is quasi - static for excitation modes .",
    "note that those modes are associated with particle emission from the horizon if the hydrodynamical flow has a dynamically formed sonic horizon .",
    "the necessary condition for the existence of the intermediate region ( [ eq : intermediate ] ) is @xmath31 in the following , we mainly consider condensate satisfying the above condition .",
    "now we investigate sonic horizon formation in an expanding bec trapped in isotropic harmonic potential , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the radial coordinate .",
    "initially , we set the condensate in a ground state with an initial atomic interaction @xmath34 . at @xmath35 ,",
    "the atomic interaction is changed suddenly from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , which makes the condensate expand .",
    "then , formation of sonic horizon can be expected .",
    "the reason is as follows : the sound velocity is proportional to square root of the condensate density and a decreasing function of @xmath33 .",
    "in contrast , the fluid velocity is an increasing function of @xmath33 and the condensate expands fast around its edge whereas @xmath38 due to the boundary condition .",
    "therefore , at an intermediate radius , @xmath39 exceeds @xmath24 and the fluid flow is transonic .",
    "it has a surface satisfying @xmath40 which is called a sonic horizon .",
    "we should note that the sonic horizon corresponds to a horizon in the analogue spacetime defined by the metric ( [ eq : effectivemetric ] ) .",
    "we also note that the subsonic region is around the center of the condensate and inside of the sonic horizon .    in general ,",
    "if a fluid has a static sonic horizon and a proper quantum state for an excitation field is realized , then it is theoretically predicted that the horizon will emit thermal radiation of the quantum field . as will be discussed in appendix [ particle - creation ] ,",
    "if the sonic horizon in the expanding condensate is quasi - static for the field @xmath13 , the horizon will emit thermal radiation into the center of the condensate .",
    "the temperature characterizing the thermal emission ( hawking temperature ) is given by the following formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the horizon radius and @xmath43 is the boltzmann s constant@xcite@xcite . from the above expression",
    ", it is found that the hawking temperature is determined by gradient of fluid and sound velocity at the horizon .",
    "thus , it is important to investigate the velocity gradients at the horizon . in the derivation of the formula ( [ eq : hawking - formula ] ) , it is assumed that the dynamically formed horizon is static , but in actual experiments , this assumption is not satisfied exactly .",
    "therefore , the spectrum of the particle is not fully given by the single planck s distribution function , but rather given by a superposition of the planck s distribution functions with slightly different temperatures .",
    "even if this is the case , the energy scale of the particle creation emitted from the dynamically formed horizon is on the order of @xmath44 .",
    "we have simulated the expansion of the condensate by solving numerically ( using the crank - nicolson scheme ) the time - dependent gp equation .",
    "the initial ground - state wave function is obtained by solving the gp equation using the steepest descent method for an initial s - wave scattering length @xmath36 and the number of atoms @xmath45 .",
    "we have computed @xmath24 and the radial velocity of the condensate via @xmath46/ ( 2mi|\\psi|^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and searched for parameter sets leading to @xmath47 .",

    "( the values of atomic interaction given below are those in the case of @xmath51 . if @xmath52 with an integer @xmath53 , then @xmath34 and @xmath50 should be multiplied by @xmath53 . )",
    "the initial atomic interaction is assumed to be @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 m is the bohr radius .",
    "the following change of the atomic interaction has been simulated : @xmath57 .    just after @xmath35 ,",
    "the condensate begins to expand in the trapping potential and the expansion is accelerated for a while . at some time , say @xmath58 , the expansion turns to be decelerated .",
    "figure [ fig : tc ] shows @xmath48 as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath48 does not depend on the initial strength of the interaction . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the condensate continues to expand , and at @xmath61 , the condensate starts to collapse .",
    "therefore , we turn off the trapping potential at @xmath62 and make the condensate expand freely in order to keep the horizon for a while .",
    "as far as we have investigated , sonic horizon always appears in the sence of the surface where @xmath39 exceeds @xmath24 . as an example of a sonic horizon ,",
    "we show fig . [",
    "fig : cvxf1 ] which is the snapshot at @xmath63 in the case of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
