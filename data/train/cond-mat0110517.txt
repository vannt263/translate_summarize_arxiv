    "several different types of specialized superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) have been developed for measuring the magnetic response of small samples .",
    "one such device is the  micro - squid \" : a thin film dc - squid with dayem - bridges as josephson junctions @xcite . in the micro - squid ,",
    "the entire device is fabricated by electron beam lithography , and the squid loop itself serves as the flux - input coil .",
    "micro - squids have the advantages of very small pickup areas ( about 1@xmath3m@xmath4 ) , and relatively small sensitivity to in - plane applied magnetic fields ( since they can be made very thin , less than 20 nm ) .",
    "micro - squids have been used for the observation of persistent currents in 2 dimensional electron gas rings @xcite , for the study of the mechanisms of magnetization reversal in ferromagnetic particles as small as 3 nm in diameter @xcite , and have been integrated into a scanning squid - afm with high magnetic field spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "however , these squids have two disadvantages : they have hysteretic current - voltage characteristics , and relatively low modulation depths in their critical current - flux characteristics . in this paper",
    "we report detailed measurements of micro - squid characteristics , and compare them with model calculations .",
    "these calculations model the micro - squid characteristics well , and could represent a valuable tool for optimizing the properties of this class of squids .",
    "the basic operating properties of micro - squids are understood : they have a hysteretic v(i ) characteristic , induced by the propagation of a hot spot . as",
    "the current is ramped up from zero , the micro - squid transits from the superconducting to the normal state at a critical current i@xmath5 .",
    "a voltage step is generated as the normal state resistance of the junction appears and the dissipated energy heats the entire micro - squid loop . when the current is lowered the micro - squid stays in the resistive state until the current is much smaller than i@xmath5 .",
    "this thermal hysteresis excludes the usual current biasing schemes used for dc - squid readout .",
    "therefore a detection technique suitable for hysteretic devices @xcite is implemented : a computer controlled circuit simultaneously triggers a current ramp and a 40mhz quartz clock .",
    "as soon as a @xmath6 pulse of a preset height is detected at the micro - squid , the clock stops and the current is set to zero .",
    "the clock reading is transferred to the computer , and the cycle begins again .",
    "the critical current is proportional to the duration of the current ramp .",
    "the fastest repetition rate is 10khz , limited by the time needed to settle the current .",
    "a single wire is sufficient to connect the micro - squid , since the @xmath6 pulse is detected on the current biasing lead .",
    "every time the critical current is measured , the flux state in the micro - squid is sampled , and every time the micro - squid becomes normally conducting the external field penetrates . as the current is reduced ( in 40ns ) to zero the micro - squid structure becomes progressively superconducting again and screening currents are set up to quantize the total flux through the micro - squid . in the limit of high critical currents different flux configurations can be stabilized in the micro - squid ring during the backswitching , leading to multivalued i@xmath7 vs b characteristics .",
    "however , the details of the dependence of the critical current of the micro - squid on magnetic field and temperature have not been well characterized .",
    "we present in this manuscript a detailed description of the underlying physics necessary for the understanding and improvement of this type of squid . in this study we made i@xmath7(t ) and",
    "i@xmath7 vs b measurements on micro - squid devices made of aluminum or niobium .",
    "each squid consists of a 1@xmath3 m square loop .",
    "bulk aluminum and niobium have very different superconducting properties , such as the coherence length @xmath8 , and the normal to superconducting transition temperature t@xmath7 .",
    "the characteristics of micro - squids ( see e.g. fig.s 2 and 4 ) do not resemble those of ideal josephson squids , in that they have relatively shallow modulation depths and triangular i@xmath7 vs b interference patterns at low temperatures .",
    "we believe that these non - ideal characteristics occur because the weak links in these squids are dayem - bridges , with dimensions comparable to the coherence length .",
    "it is well known that ",
    "long \" josephson weak links can have non - sinusoidal josephson current - phase relationships @xcite , and that non - sinusoidal josephson current - phase relationships can in turn lead to non - ideal squid i@xmath7 vs b interference patterns@xcite .",
    "faucher et al.@xcite have attributed the non - ideal critical current vs. flux characteristics of their micro - squids to the large kinetic inductance of the micro - bridges .",
    "we believe the treatment given here is equivalent to that of faucher et al . in terms of the properties of the micro - bridges , but it goes further , in that it includes the properties of the entire squid loop itself .",
    "we model the squid current - phase relationships by solving the 2-d ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "it is important to solve these equations in the full geometry of the micro - squid , since as previously pointed out in general for dayem - bridges@xcite , and as is born out by our modelling in this particular case , the phase drops and order - parameter depression associated with supercurrent flow often extend far from the micro - bridge .",
    "the first ginzburg - landau ( gl ) differential equation is@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the mass and charge of the cooper pair , @xmath12 is the complex order parameter describing the superconducting state , and @xmath13 is the vector potential .",

    "our data shows that the modulation depth is reduced compared to the short bridge model as soon as the coherence length becomes shorter than the bridge length .",

    "this implies that the heat dissipation that takes place when the squid enters the voltage state occurs well outside of the micro - bridge regions .",
    "how can the sensitivity of these micro - squids be improved ? the nb squids are limited in their sensitivity by the short coherence length of nb , as the modulation depth is maximal if the coherence length is equal to or longer than the bridge length",
    ". the coherence length could be increased by increasing the mean free path ( epitaxial films or thicker layers ) , but an increase in critical current must be avoided .",
    "the performance of these micro - squids could be improved by significantly reducing the length of the dayem bridges , perhaps using novel scanning probe techniques @xcite .",
    "decreasing thickness and width of the micro - bridge may lead to a diminution of the mean free path and thus to a diminution of the coherence length . a further way to increase sensitivity of al as well as nb micro - squids",
    "may be the suppression of thermal hysteresis .",
    "a non - hysteretic behavior may be attained by fabricating the entire squid on a normal metal plane in order to remove the heat produced by the non local phase relaxation in the microsquid .",
    "the non - hysteretic behavior will enhance the intrinsic bandwidth and allow for a standard dc - squid detection scheme .",
    "in summary , the temperature and field dependence of the critical currents in micro - squids can be understood by means of numerical calculations based on the phase dependence of the critical current predicted by a 2-d ginzburg - landau numerical calculation .",
    "it is important to do this calculation for the full micro - squid structure in many cases , because of the spreading of the variation in the superconducting phase and depression in the supercurrent density beyond the micro - bridge region in this type of device .",
