    "@xcite coined the term `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim ) to refer to intergalactic gas in the temperature range @xmath10 , and a variety of numerical simulations predict that 30 - 40% of baryons reside in the whim at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "while the hot ( @xmath12 ) , dense ( @xmath13 ) gas in galaxy clusters can be readily detected in x - rays , most of the shocked igm lies at lower temperatures and densities , where its x - ray emission is relatively feeble .",

    "the gravitational force resolution is @xmath27 ( equivalent plummer softening ) , in comoving units .",
    "the spatial resolution of the hydrodynamic calculation varies with density because of the lagrangian nature of the sph algorithm ; all gas dynamical quantities are computed by smoothing with a symmetric spline kernel that encloses 32 sph particles , or at most @xmath28 of baryons , with a minimum sph smoothing length of @xmath29 ( comoving ) .",

    "we do not adjust the temperatures of shock - heated gas particles that already lie above this relation .",
    "this after - the - fact adjustment is a good approximation to the gas temperatures we would obtain in a simulation with an ionizing background .",
    "most of the significant x - ray forest absorption will come from hotter , denser gas that is unaffected by this adjustment .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate entirely on the @xmath11 output of the simulation . owing to the difficulty of detecting x - ray forest lines at all ( as discussed in  [ sec : predictions ] below ) , observational studies are likely to focus on the quasars with the highest apparent x - ray fluxes , and hence on low redshift .",
    "we obtain density , temperature , and peculiar velocity profiles along 1200 randomly chosen lines of sight through the simulation cube , 400 in each projection , using the algorithm described by @xcite , as implemented in katz & quinn s code tipsy .",
    "each line of sight is divided into 5000 bins , so that each bin has a width of 1 km / s in velocity units , which is much finer than the few hundred km / s spectral resolution typical of the current and next generation x - ray telescopes .",
    "the contribution of each gas particle to each bin of the profile is calculated by a line integral through its spherically symmetric spline kernel , with contributions going to zero beyond the smoothing scale that encloses 32 sph neighbors .",
    "we use the densities and temperatures to compute ionic species abundances as described below (  [ sec : ionfrac ] ) , then calculate absorption spectra in redshift space by accounting for peculiar velocities and thermal broadening .",
    "we treat the projection axis of the cube as the redshift direction and make use of the periodic boundary , so a feature that would be `` shifted out '' of the cube by its peculiar velocity reappears at the opposite side . except for the computation of ionic abundances ,",
    "the calculation is entirely analogous to the calculation of  forest absorption by @xcite .",
    "consider an absorption system of a given temperature , density , and path length .",
    "the strength of the absorption line produced by a given transition of a given ion is proportional to the path length , the transition oscillator strength , the abundance of the element in question , and the fraction of that element in the given ionization state , which depends in turn on the temperature , density , and the ionizing background radiation .",
    "the predicted number of lines per unit redshift also depends on the covering factor of absorbers with the temperature , density , and path length required to yield detectable absorption . to decide which lines to consider in our study",
    ", we first made a preliminary screening of all of the ions and transition lines listed in @xcite .",
    "we selected those with element abundance greater than @xmath34 and resonance lines with energy above 0.25 kev ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "for each ion we selected the resonance line with the greatest oscillator strength .",
    "we then calculated the total absorption produced along all 1200 lines of sight through the simulation box , i.e. , the summed equivalent widths of all of the absorption lines produced by these transitions , and ranked the ions accordingly .",
    "the ions that produced at least one of the ten strongest lines are listed in table  [ ions ] .",
    "in addition to and , we found that , , , , , , , and produce relatively large amounts of absorption .",
    "detection of x - ray forest lines requires that the observed energy be larger than @xmath36 , both because of instrumental sensitivity and to avoid absorption by the galactic interstellar medium .",
    "lines in table  [ ions ] with energy @xmath37 can therefore be observed only to a maximum redshift @xmath38 . @xcite",
    "have used press - schechter models to predict absorption by  and by two ionic species with much higher transition energies , ( @xmath39 ) and ( @xmath40 ) , which can potentially be observed out to high redshifts ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "these last two ionization states become abundant only at the high temperatures ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ) characteristic of rich galaxy clusters , which are poorly represented in our simulation box owing to its limited size .",
    "we therefore do not attempt to make predictions for these ions .",
    "the analytic method used by @xcite is well adapted to the study of these highly ionized species , which are likely to occur only in the virialized regions that are best described by the press - schechter approximation and which are too rare to be well represented in our hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "our numerical approach complements this analytic method by allowing more accurate investigation of lower ionization species , which may be found in lower density , unvirialized regions .",
    "the and absorption associated with forest lines implies that the metallicity of the low density igm is @xmath43 of solar at high redshift ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at low redshift ( @xmath44 ) , @xcite found [ c / h ] @xmath45 for hi absorbers with @xmath46  using hubble fos data . in the denser igm of x - ray clusters , on the other hand ,",
    "the inferred metal abundance is as high as one third of solar @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these observations give little guidance to the metallicity of the regions with @xmath47 that are responsible for the x - ray forest at @xmath11 . while metal enrichment can be tracked in a simulation either during dynamical evolution , as in hgm and @xcite , or in post - processing , as in @xcite , the numerical predictions are sensitive to the uncertain details of metal ejection from the immediate vicinity of galaxies .",
    "rather than adopt an explicit but model - dependent prescription for the metallicity as a function of environment , we will generally assume that the metallicity of the medium that produces x - ray forest absorption is @xmath48 , intermediate between the  forest and cluster igm values .",
    "we also assume that the relative abundances of the different elements are similar to those in the sun ; some authors ( e.g. , fbc ) have adopted enhanced abundances of @xmath49-elements ( oxygen in particular ) , characteristic of type ii sn enrichment .",
    "since most absorbers are unsaturated , predicted equivalent widths are simply proportional to the assumed metallicity , but this proportionality breaks down for the strongest absorbers .",
    "we discuss the impact of different metallicity assumptions , in particular the effects of including a density - dependent metallicity and scatter about the mean metallicity - density relation @xcite , in  [ sec : ewdist ] below .      as discussed below in  [ sec : ionfrac ] , ionic abundances are affected by both collisional ionization and photoionization . to compute the latter ,",
    "we must adopt an intensity and spectrum of the x - ray background , which contains the ionizing photons that are relevant to these high ionization species .",
    "for most of our calculations , we adopt the background of ( * ? ? ? * hereafter mi98 ) , which was based on asca and rosat data : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this has a higher intensity and slightly steeper slope than the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bf92 ) background , which was adopted by hgm .",
    "the bf92 background spectrum is @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ xrb ] plots the bf92 and mi98 background spectra as dotted and short - dashed lines , respectively .",
    "extrapolation of these x - ray background fits to longer wavelengths substantially underestimates the flux expected from quasars and star - forming galaxies . while the uv photoionizing background makes little difference for high ionization x - ray lines , it does matter for determining the ionic abundances of hi , , and , at relatively low densities and temperatures , .",
    "we therefore include a uv background @xmath55 with @xmath56 , based on @xcite .",
    "this background is shown by the long - dashed line in figure  [ xrb ] .",
    "we generally use the mi98 spectrum at energies @xmath57 and the uv background  ( [ eqn : uvb ] ) at energies @xmath58 , where it exceeds the mi98 spectrum , though we have repeated some of our calculations for different background choices as discussed below .",
    "we calculate the ionization fraction for each ion at a number of temperature and density grid points with an assumed radiation background , using the publicly available code cloudy @xcite .",
    "the ionization fraction of each ion for any given temperature and density is then obtained by interpolation .",
    "figures  [ cnofrac ] and  [ nesifefrac ] illustrate the resulting ionization fractions that enter our calculations . figure  [ cnofrac ] show results for the hydrogen - like , helium - like , and lithium - like states of oxygen ( top row ) , nitrogen ( middle row ) , and carbon ( bottom row ) .",
    "curves in the central panels are calculated using our standard radiation background for a gas density @xmath59 , which corresponds to a baryon overdensity @xmath60 at @xmath11 for our adopted cosmological parameters .",
    "right - hand panels show calculations for @xmath61 , an overdensity @xmath62 .",
    "left - hand panels show results for collisional ionization only , in which case ionization fractions are independent of density .",
    "( we actually compute these curves using @xmath59 and a radiation background reduced in intensity by a factor of @xmath63 . )    since oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon all exhibit similar behavior , we restrict ourselves to oxygen in the following discussion . in the absence of photoionization , the fragile , lithium - like species  exists only over a narrow temperature range , @xmath64 , and even in this range its fractional abundance never exceeds 0.25 .",
    "the helium - like state , , dominates a much wider temperature range , with a fraction exceeding 0.5 for @xmath65 . at higher temperatures ,  begins to give way to , though the  fraction never exceeds @xmath66 because temperatures high enough to produce  are also high enough to produce  ( not shown on the plot ) .",
    "similarly , at low temperatures  and  give way to lower ionization species .",
    "at these densities , photoionization has a major impact on the predicted abundances .",
    "there is still a general trend of moving from  to  to  as the temperature increases , but with photoionization included each species occupies a much wider temperature range , and there are more temperatures at which multiple species co - exist . for @xmath62 ,",
    "the peak  fraction occurs at @xmath67 , and the  fraction peaks at @xmath9 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the recombination rates are higher relative to the photoionization rates , so the curves shift towards those of pure collisional ionization , but even in this case remains significant down to temperatures of @xmath68 and  to @xmath69 . more generally , for the densities characteristic of intergalactic filaments or the outskirts of clusters and groups , photoionization allows a species to exist at temperatures far below those deduced from the collisional equilibrium ionization fractions .    the behavior of nitrogen and carbon is entirely analogous to that of oxygen , except that all the curves are shifted towards lower temperature owing to the lower ionization energies . for the more highly ionized species shown in figure  [ nesifefrac ] ,",
    "photoionization is usually much less significant , since there are fewer high energy photons .",
    "however , it still makes a difference in some cases for @xmath62 .",
    "note the expanded temperature scale of figure  [ nesifefrac ] relative to figure  [ cnofrac ] .",
    "the highly ionized iron species , and , occur only at the high temperatures characteristic of rich clusters , though occurs at the lower temperatures characteristic of the whim .",
    "figure  [ bfvsmi ] shows the dependence of the oxygen predictions on the adopted radiation background . in each panel ,",
    "heavy and light lines show the ionization fractions for the mi98 and bf92 x - ray background spectra , respectively .",
    "upper panels show results including the uv background spectrum of equation  ( [ eqn : uvb ] ) ( using the maximum of the x - ray background and uv background at each wavelength ) , and lower panels show results using the x - ray background only .",
    "there is little difference between the results that use the mi98 or bf92 spectra , indicating that uncertainties in the x - ray background should introduce little uncertainty in our predictions .",
    "however , the uv background makes a significant difference for  and to some extent , particularly at higher densities and lower temperatures .",
    "uncertainty in the intensity and spectral shape of the uv background introduces some uncertainty in our  predictions , but it should make little difference to our predictions of x - ray absorption .",
    "it is worth noting at this point the two main physical differences between our calculations and those of fbc .",
    "the first is that our simulation incorporates radiative cooling , which changes the temperature structure of collapsed regions and allows some of the gas to condense into galaxies , removing it from the igm .",
    "the second is that our analysis incorporates photoionization , while fbc only include collisional ionization . as we can see from figures  [ cnofrac]-[bfvsmi ] , photoionization makes an important difference for oxygen , nitrogen , and carbon , though it is less significant for higher ionization species .",
    "fbc also assume a much higher metallicity , with an oxygen abundance of 0.5 solar , but this difference just shifts absorber column densities by a factor of five .",
    "our input physics is similar to that of hgm , who incorporate radiative cooling and photoionization using the bf92 x - ray background but do not include a uv background .",
    "the transmitted x - ray flux is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the quasar s x - ray continuum multiplied by the instrument response function and @xmath72 is the optical depth at observed frequency @xmath73 .",
    "we will assume that the continuum can be determined and divided out , so we define @xmath74 in equation  ( [ eqn : fnu ] ) and refer to the transmitted flux @xmath75 as the simulated spectrum .",
    "strong atomic features are rare in this wavelength regime , so continuum estimation is relatively straightforward if the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectrum is high enough .",
    "the absorption spectrum is determined by a convolution of the ion number density along the line of sight with the absorption line profile , @xmath76 where @xmath77 label the atomic number , the ionization stage , and the transition line of the ion , respectively , @xmath78 is the oscillator strength of the transition , and @xmath79 is the ion number density .",

    "we do not incorporate damping wings in the line profile , but they are negligible for these weak absorption lines .    as described in  2.1 , the average density , temperature , and velocity of gas for each of the 5000 bins in a line of sight were extracted from the simulation using tipsy . for each ion of interest",
    ", we calculate the ionization fraction for these temperature and density values by interpolating among the cloudy outputs . the optical depth along each line of sight",
    "is then obtained by carrying out the convolution , equation  ( [ eqn : spectrum ] ) , numerically .",
    "we consider each ionic species in isolation , so in practice we do not perform the sum in equation  ( [ eqn : spectrum ] ) , only the integral . because x - ray forest lines are rare and the bright quasars amenable to study with present instruments are at low redshifts , there will usually not be much ambiguity in identification of features .",
    "figure  [ simspec ] shows a sample  absorption spectrum , one that contains a strong feature . as the lower panels demonstrate , this absorption feature arises in the hot gas halo of a moderate sized group , with a typical gas temperature of a few@xmath95 . for clarity ,",
    "we have ignored peculiar velocities when calculating these profiles , but we include thermal broadening in the optical depth and flux profiles . the dashed line in the top panel shows the redshift - space spectrum , in which the absorption feature is shifted by peculiar velocity but not changed substantially in width or depth . in all of our statistical calculations below ,",
    "we identify absorbers and measure their properties from the redshift - space spectrum , including peculiar velocities .",
    "we identify absorbers using a simple threshold algorithm : an absorber is defined as a region where all the pixels have absorption above a given threshold . because x - ray forest absorbers are likely to be unresolved or nearly unresolved , at least for the foreseeable future , more elaborate algorithms that deblend distinct peaks or fit superpositions of voigt profiles are unnecessary for our present purposes .",
    "we adopt an absorption threshold of 0.01 , hence absorbers consist of contiguous pixels with transmitted flux less than 0.99 .",
    "we have checked the effect of using different thresholds and found that while the number of weak absorbers is slightly suppressed by a higher threshold , the number of strong absorbers is insensitive to the threshold value . in figure",
    "[ simspec ] , the boundary of the absorber is marked by ticks on the spectrum .    the equivalent width of an absorber is @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the optical depth .",
    "the equivalent width defined in this way has velocity units .",
    "conversions to other useful units are @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath37 are the observed line wavelength and energy , respectively . for optically thin absorbers ,",
    "there is a linear relation between equivalent width and column density , @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the column density and @xmath103 is the transition oscillator strength . since x - ray forest lines are weak and fairly broad , equation  ( [ col - width ] )",
    "is usually a good approximation .",
    "however , the equivalent widths of the strongest absorbers are depressed by saturation .",
    "figure  [ colo78 ] demonstrates this effect , plotting the ratio of actual equivalent width to the optically thin value of equation  ( [ col - width ] ) for the  and   absorbers along our 1200 lines of sight .",
    "the upper panels show results using our standard metallicity @xmath4 , and the lower panels show results using @xmath104 , i.e. , a factor of ten increase in absorber column densities . for , saturation becomes significant above @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and by @xmath107 the equivalent width is typically depressed by a factor of two .",
    "there are very few absorbers in this regime for @xmath108 , but a significant number for @xmath104 .",
    "saturation of  lines does not become significant until @xmath109 , and we find few absorbers of this column density even with @xmath104 .",
    "we will generally present our results in terms of equivalent width ( including saturation effects ) because this quantity is more directly determined from observations , but we also label our plots by the corresponding optically thin column density of equation  ( [ col - width ] ) , to aid with physical interpretations and to compare with other numerical and analytic predictions .",
    "figure  [ optdisto ] presents our principal quantitative prediction , the cumulative distribution of  and  absorbers as a function of equivalent width .",
    "we plot @xmath110 , which is equivalent to the number of lines per unit redshift at @xmath11 . adopting the bf92 background in place of the mi98 one , or omitting the additional uv background at longer wavelengths ,",
    "makes a nearly imperceptible difference to these curves . as mentioned earlier",
    ", the number of weak absorbers would be lower if we adopted a higher threshold for the line identification algorithm , but the number of strong absorbers would be unaffected .",

    "the number of  lines drops to one per unit redshift at @xmath111 ( 25@xmath112 for ) and falls rapidly for larger @xmath113 .",
    "the paucity of stronger absorbers is not surprising : for @xmath4 , a 1 mpc path length through a medium with @xmath114 ( @xmath60 ) and an fraction of 0.5 yields a column density of @xmath115 , or @xmath111 , and longer path lengths at such high density and fraction are rare .",
    "dotted curves in figure  [ optdisto ] show predictions for a solar metallicity igm .",
    "the increase in oxygen abundance boosts the column density of each absorber by the same factor , and at low @xmath113 the equivalent width distribution simply shifts to the right by a factor of ten . at high @xmath113",
    "the rightward shift is smaller , since saturation begins to suppress the linear relation between equivalent width and column density ; the high-@xmath113 tails of the solar metallicity distribution functions are therefore steeper . because the equivalent width distribution falls steeply at high @xmath113 even for @xmath4 , a modest increase in metallicity can still translate into a large increase in the predicted number of systems above some threshold  i.e. , a small horizontal shift creates a large vertical shift . labeled vertical error bars in figure  [ optdisto ]",
    "show representative @xmath116 detection thresholds for several different x - ray satellites , which we discuss in  [ sec : capabilities ] below .",
    "unfortunately , one can already see that a comprehensive study of the x - ray forest with current instruments will be challenging unless the igm has near solar metallicity , which seems unreasonably optimistic .",
    "the remaining curves in figure  [ optdisto ] are discussed at the end of the section , where we consider the potential impact of non - uniform metallicity .",
    "the equivalent width distributions for the other ions listed in table  [ ions ] are shown in figures  [ optdistcn ] and  [ optdistnesife ] , computed assuming 0.1 solar metallicity and the mi98+uv background .",
    "the number of high equivalent width absorbers is generally much smaller than for  or .",
    "roughly speaking , one can think of the lower element abundances and , in some cases , weaker transition oscillator strengths as shifting the previous equivalent width distributions towards lower @xmath113 , though of course the distribution also depends on the occurrence of density and temperature regimes where these ions have a high fractional abundance . as a guide to relative observability",
    ", we list in table  [ ions ] the equivalent width threshold above which we find one absorber per unit redshift in our simulated spectra for our standard assumptions .",
    "this threshold is roughly proportional to the adopted metallicity , though it would increase more slowly above @xmath117 because of saturation ( see figure  [ colo78 ] ) . and have the strongest absorption after oxygen , but their strong resonance lines lie at 40.3  and 33.7 , respectively , which restricts their observability to relatively low redshift quasars and puts them in a range of poorer instrument sensitivity even at zero redshift . and produce the next strongest absorption ; their transition energies are higher , but the predicted equivalent widths are a factor @xmath118 lower than those of and .    while the focus of this paper is x - ray absorption , the ( 1032 , 1038 ) uv doublet of  is another potential tracer of intergalactic gas at these densities and temperatures , and is observable from hubble space telescope or the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) .",

    "the total number of absorbers in the simulations at the equivalent widths where we disagree is small , and it could be that the difference simply reflects statistical fluctuations in the structure present in the two simulation volumes . however , we think that the most likely source of difference is the treatment of igm metallicity : we assume a uniform metallicity of 0.1 solar , whereas hgm track the spread of metals in their simulation , so that the metallicity varies with spatial position .",
    "they comment that typical metallicities are @xmath131 in the density and temperature range that dominate x - ray forest absorption , but they do not plot the scatter in metallicity , and it could be that the strongest absorption occurs in regions where the metallicity is higher than average .",

    "an x - ray spectrum of a moderate redshift quasar might have @xmath157 resolution elements in which absorption could potentially fall , so the @xmath158 threshold for a `` blind '' detection must be fairly high to avoid the spurious identification of noise peaks as absorption systems .",

    "a search for  and  absorption associated with known absorption ( from uv observations ) holds considerably more promise than a blind search for x - ray forest absorption , for two reasons .",
    "first , when searching at a redshift that is known a priori , the required @xmath158 for a significant detection is lower , @xmath172 instead of @xmath5 , and at these equivalent widths the number of systems rises sharply with decreasing detection threshold .",
