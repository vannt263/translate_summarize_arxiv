    "<S> the paper is continuation of the previous work concerning the massless case . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is devoted to lightsheets generated by spheres . </S>",
    "<S> conditions under which the bousso bound can be violated are discussed and it is shown that a possible violating region can not be arbitrarily large and that it is contained inside a sphere of unit planck radius if the number of independent spin states @xmath0 is small enough . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the central temperature must exceed the planck temperature in order to get a violation of the bousso bound for @xmath0 not too large . </S>",
    "<S> the situation for higher - dimensional spacetimes is also discussed and the fmw conditions are investigated . </S>"
