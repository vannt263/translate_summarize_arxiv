    "the most striking feature of the quark and charged lepton masses is their hierarchical structure .",
    "an entire industry has developed in an attempt to understand this pattern , most recently in the context of supersymmetric theories @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will construct a supersymmetric model of flavor with the physics of the neutrino sector specifically in mind .    given the hierarchy of the charged fermion masses , it is natural to assume that the neutrino masses follow a similar hierarchical structure : @xmath4 .",
    "however , we will consider an alternative possibility , that the three generations of neutrinos are nearly degenerate , with small splittings sufficient to explain ( i ) the solar neutrino problem via @xmath5-@xmath6 msw oscillations , and ( ii ) the atmospheric neutrino problem via @xmath6-@xmath7 mixing @xcite . while these effects can be explained in models with hierarchical neutrino masses as well , it is important to explore all the possibilities , especially in light of the evidence from the superkamiokande experiment that neither the solar nor atmospheric neutrino problems are about to disappear @xcite .",
    "a number of interesting theories with quasi - degenerate neutrinos can be found in the recent literature @xcite , and given the improvement in the experimental situation , it is worthwhile to give this and other scenarios further consideration .",
    "our model is based on a global non - abelian family symmetry that restricts the quark , lepton , neutrino , and scalar superparticle mass matrices simultaneously ; we do nt consider the lepton sector in isolation , unlike some of the other models on the market .",
    "we assume flavor - symmetry breaking originates in the fermion yukawa couplings via a sequential breaking of the flavor symmetry group .",
    "hence , we avoid any ansatz for the yukawa textures that can not be motivated from symmetry considerations .",
    "interestingly , the elements of the yukawa matrices in our model that control right - handed rotations in the quark sector largely determine the neutrino mixing angles .",
    "this provides another constraint on the form of the yukawa textures .",
    "we show that the model can solve problems ( i ) and ( ii ) above via the seesaw mechanism , yielding the appropriate neutrino mass ratios and mixing angles in terms of ratios of quark yukawa couplings .",
    "in addition , the model solves the supersymmetric flavor problem by yielding superparticle degeneracies in the flavor symmetric limit . with the origin of flavor symmetry breaking specified , we consider the detailed form of the superparticle mass matrices and state the distinctive supersymmetric signatures of the model .",
    "in the limit of vanishing yukawa couplings , the supersymmetric standard model has a global @xmath8 flavor symmetry , with a separate u(3 ) factor acting on each of the chiral superfields @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "one approach to constructing models of flavor is to impose a horizontal symmetry that is a subgroup of u(3)@xmath14u(3)@xmath15 u(3)@xmath16 alone , where u(3)@xmath17 and u(3)@xmath16 are assumed to act on the lepton fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this way",
    ", the known similarity between the down quark and charged lepton masses @xcite can be understood , up to factors of order unity .",
    "this approach was taken in refs .",
    "@xcite and will also be adopted here . while this choice leaves a twofold ambiguity in assigning the @xmath12 and @xmath13 transformation properties , only one assignment , in which @xmath12 and @xmath13 transform under u(3)@xmath16 and u(3)@xmath17 , respectively , will lead to the desired pattern of neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "we must first decide on a subgroup of u(3)@xmath18 to use in constructing a model , and specify the transformation properties of the right - handed neutrino fields , @xmath19 .",
    "since our goal is to construct a model of quasi - degenerate neutrino masses , we will require the mass matrix of the light neutrino mass eigenstates to be proportional to the identity in the flavor - symmetric limit .",
    "since this mass matrix arises via the see - saw mechanism , @xmath20 we can achieve degeneracy if the dirac and majorana mass matrices , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , are individually proportional to the identity .",
    "if the lepton doublet @xmath12 is in a three dimensional representation of some subgroup of u(3)@xmath16 , then we can achieve the desired form of @xmath21 if @xmath19 transforms in the @xmath23 ( assuming the higgs fields are singlets ) .",
    "however , we also require @xmath22 to be invariant under the flavor symmetry and proportional to the identity , which implies that @xmath24 ; thus we seek a subgroup of u(3)@xmath16 that has real three - dimensional representations .",
    "the largest subgroup that is appropriate is so(3 ) , which we will adopt henceforth . as for the part of the flavor symmetry that lives in the factors u(3)@xmath25 u(3)@xmath26",
    ", we will take the largest symmetry possible , u(3)@xmath25u(3)@xmath26 itself .",
    "thus , we begin with the maximal flavor symmetry group appropriate for our purposes , @xmath27 where the three generations of left- and right - handed neutrinos transform as three dimensional vectors under so(3)@xmath16 .    the top quark yukawa coupling breaks @xmath28 strongly down to @xmath29 where the u(1 ) factor rotates @xmath30 and @xmath31 by an opposite phase .",
    "this is the approximate flavor symmetry relevant at low energies , with the light fermion yukawa couplings treated as small symmetry breaking parameters .",
    "notice that the large top quark yukawa coupling does not break the so(3 ) symmetry , so we do nt expect any large deviation from degeneracy in the neutrino sector . to properly construct the low - energy effective theory",
    ", we consider all operators invariant under @xmath32 , with the light fermion yukawa couplings included as small symmetry - breaking parameters . alternatively",
    ", we could directly impose @xmath32 as the high - energy flavor symmetry , in which case an order one top quark yukawa coupling would follow as a prediction of the theory .",
    "if we assume that the light fermion yukawa couplings are the only source of flavor symmetry breaking , we can estimate the symmetry breaking effect in any operator of interest in the low - energy effective theory @xcite .",
    "suppose that the yukawa couplings in the quark sector originate from fields that transform simultaneously under pairs of the group factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gffull ] ) @xmath33 here we state @xmath28 transformation properties of the fields for notational convenience only .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that this is simply a shorthand for representing the set of fields contained in the @xmath32 decomposition of the @xmath34 . using these fields",
    ", we may write down the following higher - dimensional superpotential interactions @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the flavor scale . we will specify the origin of these operators below .",
    "yukawa couplings arise if the @xmath34 acquire an appropriate pattern of vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . for example",
    ", let us consider the following pattern of vevs , given in units of @xmath36 : @xmath37 @xmath38 here , the @xmath39 are the quark yukawa couplings , @xmath40 is the cabibbo angle , and the @xmath41 are cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing angles .",
    "order one coefficients have been suppressed .",
    "the diagonal elements yield the quark mass eigenvalues , while the entries that determine rotations on the left - handed down quark fields reproduce the ckm angles @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the remaining elements , which control right - handed rotations in the quark sector , will give us the desired flavor structure in the neutrino sector of the theory .",
    "an important point is that the hierarchy of entries in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : texture1 ] ) and ( [ eq : texture2 ] ) can be understood in terms of a sequential breaking of the original symmetry group @xmath28 , through a series of subgroups at successively lower scales below @xmath36 .",
    "we may assume that each of these scales is associated with one or more @xmath34 fields that acquire the most general set of vevs consistent with with the unbroken flavor symmetries at that scale ; elements of the yukawa matrices that differ hierarchically originate from the vevs of different @xmath34 fields .",
    "the textures in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : texture1 ] ) and ( [ eq : texture2 ] ) then arise naturally given the symmetry breaking pattern shown in table .  1 .",
    ".sequential symmetry breaking leading to the mass matrices in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : texture1 ] ) and ( [ eq : texture2 ] ) the u(1)@xmath42 act on the @xmath43 superfield of the @xmath44 generation , and the @xmath45 flips the sign of the superfield @xmath46 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to the predictions for flavor - changing neutral currents , this model makes a striking prediction for the diagonal squark and slepton masses .",
    "since the low - energy effective theory is constrained by the symmetry @xmath32 , whose non - abelian factors are u(2)@xmath25u(2)@xmath47so(3)@xmath16 , we expect the left - handed up and down squarks , as well as the right - handed up squarks to be nearly degenerate for the first two generations respectively ( with the third generation scalar mass differing by some order one factor ) , while the right - handed down squarks remain more nearly degenerate for all three generations , because of the approximate so(3 ) symmetry .",
    "corresponding statements can be made in the lepton sector .",
    "if we choose to think of the high energy flavor symmetry as @xmath28 , then we can restate this result by noting that the original symmetry , which treats all three generations equally , has some remnant effect in sectors of the theory that are not directly affected by the mechanism which generates the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "this fact is what allowed us to obtain quasi - degenerate neutrinos , as well as the associated phenomenology described above .",
    "we have presented a model with quasi - degenerate neutrinos that can account for the solar and atmospheric neutrino problems . by working with a flavor symmetry that constrains both the quark and lepton sectors",
    ", the model relates the neutrino mass squared splittings and mixing angles to quark yukawa couplings , @xmath48 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these have the correct orders of magnitude to give us the small angle msw solution to the solar neutrino problem , as well as atmospheric @xmath6-@xmath7 oscillations .",
    "the model naturally evades the supersymmetric flavor problem by maintaining sufficient squark and slepton degeneracy , while yielding definite predictions for the flavor structure of the superparticle mass matrices .",
    "in particular , the approximate flavor symmetry at low energies implies approximate three - generation degeneracy for the right - handed down squarks and left - handed charged leptons , respectively , while approximate degeneracy among only the first two generations for the remaining squarks and slepton states .",
    "the model predicts @xmath49 just beyond the current bound , so that we would expect this process to be detected with an order of magnitude improvement in experimental sensitivity .",
