    "in recent years , there has been much interest in the study of the structure of networks arising from real world systems @xcite .",
    "another concern has been dynamical processes taking place on networks , and the impact of network structure on such dynamics .",
    "the largest eigenvalue of the network adjacency matrix has emerged as a key quantity important for the study of a variety of different dynamical network processes . in particular , this is the case for synchronization of coupled heterogeneous oscillators @xcite , percolation on directed networks @xcite , linear stability of the fixed points of systems of network - coupled ordinary differential equations @xcite , and several other examples in physics and chemistry @xcite . in this paper we study methods of obtaining approximations to the maximum eigenvalue for the adjacency matrix for the case of large complex networks .",
    "we consider a network as a directed graph with @xmath0 nodes , and we associate to it an @xmath1 adjacency matrix whose elements @xmath2 are one if there is a directed link from @xmath3 to @xmath4 and zero otherwise ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we denote the largest eigenvalue of @xmath6 by @xmath7 ( it may be shown that of all the eigenvalues of @xmath6 , the one with largest magnitude is real and positive @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we note that it is often the case that the largest eigenvalue is well separated from the second largest eigenvalue .",
    "the properties of @xmath7 have been studied in the context of small or regular graphs @xcite and in classical erds - renyi random graphs @xcite . however , the structure of real world networks is usually more complex , as evidenced by the fact that the degree distribution in a large number of examples has been found to be highly heterogeneous ( often following a power law @xcite ) , where the _ out - degree _ and _ in - degree _ of a node @xmath3 are defined by @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the ` degree distributions ' , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , are defined as the probabilities that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath13 and/or @xmath14 . if @xmath15 we say the graph is undirected . for an undirected graph each link serves as both an in and out link for each of the two nodes it joins and for any node @xmath3 we have @xmath16 .",
    "thus in the undirected case we write @xmath17 to denote the corresponding degree distribution .",
    "the effect of the degree distribution on the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix has been explored recently by chung _",
    "@xcite , who considered a particular ensemble of random _ uncorrelated _ , undirected networks whose number of nodes @xmath0 is large ( see also @xcite ) . here , by uncorrelated we mean that we regard the network to be a random draw from some ensemble of networks for which the joint probability distribution of the node degrees @xmath18 factors , @xmath19 . chung _",
    "_ found that in the limit @xmath20 these networks yield an expected largest eigenvalue that is determined by the ratio @xmath21 of the second to first moment of the average degree distribution , @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and by the expected largest degree @xmath24 .",
    "specifically , they found that @xmath25 some previous results for dynamical processes in networks have been stated in terms of the quantity @xmath26 , for example , the synchronization threshold in the _ mean field theory _ of coupled oscillators in networks @xcite and the network percolation and epidemic spreading thresholds @xcite .",
    "real world networks often have some amount of degree - degree correlations @xcite , i.e. , a node of a given degree is more likely to be connected to nodes with particular degrees than would be expected on the basis of chance .",
    "networks in which high degree nodes connect preferentially to high ( low ) degree nodes , and viceversa , are called _ assortative _ ( _ disassortative _ ) .",
    "such correlations can affect dynamical process on networks , as has been demonstrated for example in epidemic spreading models and percolation @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that the in- and out- degrees at a node can have different distributions [ i.e. , @xmath27 , as has been noted for some corporate information and genetic networks @xcite , and that there are potential correlations between the in- and out- degrees at the _ same _ node which can also significantly affect the largest eigenvalue .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ correlations ] reviews the characterization of degree correlations .",
    "section [ corre ] develops the theory of the maximum eigenvalue @xmath7 for the case of networks that satisfy a certain markovian property .",
    "some of the considerations of sec .",
    "[ corre ] are similar to theory in previous papers , where , however , those previous considerations were application specific , and the more general applicability to the largest eigenvalue was not apparent .",
    "section [ sempling ] considers results for numerical constructions of network adjacency matrices of different types .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , we define @xmath10 as the probability that a randomly chosen node has in - degree @xmath13 and out - degree @xmath14 .    as we shall see later , for networks without neighbor degree - degree correlations , a first order approximation to the eigenvalue @xmath7 , generalizing eq .",
    "( [ d2d1 ] ) , is given by @xmath28 where we recall that @xmath29 denotes an average over nodes , and @xmath30 means either @xmath31 or @xmath32 which are equal : @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are independent , the largest eigenvalue is approximately given by @xmath36 , and if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are perfectly correlated , so that @xmath37 ( e.g. , as in an undirected network ) , the largest eigenvalue is approximately @xmath38 .",
    "we see that correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 can crucially affect the eigenvalue , especially if the second moment of either degree distribution diverges with increasing @xmath0 , while the first moment converges : in such a case independence leads to a finite eigenvalue estimate , and perfect correlation to a diverging eigenvalue estimate .    in order to quantify the correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 at a node , we define the node degree correlation coefficient , @xmath39 note that if there are no correlations , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is larger ( smaller ) than @xmath42 for positive ( negative ) correlations . in terms of the correlation coefficient , @xmath26",
    "is given by @xmath43    for undirected networks @xmath6 is a symmetric positive matrix , and thus its largest eigenvalue satisfies @xmath44 for any @xmath0-vector @xmath45 . choosing the components of @xmath45 to be zero for nodes not connected to the node of largest degree @xmath46 , to be one for nodes connected to the node of largest degree , and @xmath47 for the node of largest degree , eq .",
    "( [ qq ] ) yields @xmath48 if @xmath49 , the mean - field approximation ( [ mefi ] ) must be incorrect .",
    "thus , for undirected networks we use as a heuristic alternative to the mean - field approximation , @xmath50 which is consistent with both of the regimes considered in the rigorous result ( [ chunga ] ) .",
    "( we remark , however , that eq .",
    "( [ dmax2 ] ) holds in principle only if the ratio @xmath51 or its inverse is large enough [ see eq .",
    "( [ chunga ] ) ] ) . one way of viewing eq .",
    "( [ dmax2 ] ) is that eq .",
    "( [ qq ] ) implies that @xmath7 is at least as large as the maximum eigenvalue of any subnetwork of the original network ( by a subnetwork we mean one obtained by deleting links of the original network ) .",
    "considering a subnetwork consisting of the node of maximum degree and the nodes connecting to it , shown in fig .",
    "[ nodo ] ( a ) , eq .",
    "( [ dmax ] ) corresponds to the fact that @xmath47 is the maximum eigenvalue of this star network .",
    "the regime @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ dmax2 ] ) applies to networks whose largest eigenvalue is dominated by the node with largest degree .",
    "we now contrast the above situation for undirected networks with what can happen for directed networks .",
    "we first note that the reasoning leading to ( [ dmax2 ] ) may not hold .",
    "for example , eq .  ( [ qq ] ) no longer applies , and a node with many in and out links does not necessarily make a subnetwork with large eigenvalue .",
    "regarding the latter point , consider fig .",
    "[ nodo](b ) as compared to fig .",
    "[ nodo](a ) .",
    "this directed network has all its eigenvalues zero , because no pair of in and out links connect the same two nodes .",
    "moreover , if one views @xmath13 and @xmath14 to diverge as @xmath0 increases at a rate sufficiently more slowly than @xmath0 , then , as @xmath0 approaches infinity , the probability of an out link and an in link from the central node connecting to the same peripheral node goes to zero with increasing @xmath0 , if these peripheral nodes are randomly chosen .",
    "for our subsequent analysis it is useful to introduce an edge degree correlation coefficient @xmath53 characterizing the correlation between the in - degree at node @xmath3 and the out - degree at node @xmath4 , where a directed link goes from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath54 where @xmath55 denotes an average over edges , @xmath56 using ( [ erage ] ) we have @xmath57 @xmath58 and so @xmath59 ( our definition of the edge degree correlation coefficient @xmath53 is related to but slightly different from that of newman @xcite . )",
    "we note that the term @xmath60 that appears in the definition of @xmath61 is the number of directed paths of length three , i.e. , the number of links of the form @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , @xmath63 is the number of paths of length @xmath64 , and @xmath65 is the number of paths of length @xmath42 ( or the number of links ) .",
    "accordingly , let us write @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . with this notation , the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath53 can be rewritten as @xmath69 @xmath70 as an example of this interpretation , we note that for networks with uncorrelated in- and out - degrees , the number of paths of length two is @xmath71 , and so @xmath72 . for networks where there are no neighbor degree correlations , the number of paths of length three , @xmath73 , can be obtained from the number of paths of length two , @xmath74 , times the average branching ratio given by @xmath75 , and thus @xmath76 for such networks .",
    "for generality , in this section we allow different types of network nodes , where we specify the node type by an index @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the total number of possible node types ( e.g. , in the case of social networks connecting people , @xmath79 might label sex , race , social class , etc . ) .",
    "furthermore , we introduce the quantity @xmath80 which we refer to as the degree . with this definition",
    ", we use @xmath81 to denote the degree distribution , i.e. , @xmath81 is the probability that a randomly chosen node has degree @xmath82 . this implies , for example , that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the number of nodes of type @xmath79 and @xmath85 .",
    "( while our numerical examples in sec .",
    "[ sempling ] are for the case of a single node type , @xmath86 , the subsequent considerations in the present section do not have this restriction . )",
    "we consider a particular class of networks for which the only nontrivial correlations are between nodes that are directly connected by a single link .",
    "such _ markovian _",
    "networks have been considered in previous works on epidemic spreading and percolation @xcite . under this assumption , if we define @xmath87 to be the probability that a node with degree @xmath82 has an outgoing link to a node with degree @xmath88 , then if we choose a random outward path of length two from a node with degree @xmath82 , the probability that the first hop ends on a node with degree @xmath88 and the second on a node with degree @xmath89 is , by this assumption , @xmath90    let @xmath91 be the expected number of directed paths of length @xmath92 whose starting node has degree @xmath82 . using the assumption that the network is markovian , we can express @xmath93 in terms of @xmath94 as @xmath95 the number of paths of length @xmath92 grows , in the limit of large @xmath92 , as the largest eigenvalue @xmath7 , @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can associate to eq .",
    "( [ psis ] ) the eigenvalue problem @xmath97 and we seek its largest eigenvalue @xmath98 and its corresponding eigenfunction @xmath99 .",
    "we consider @xmath98 to be an approximation to @xmath7 that is more accurate than the mean field result in that it includes correlations between connected nodes , @xmath100 .",
    "additionally , an approximation @xmath101 to the right eigenvector @xmath102 of @xmath6 can be obtained in terms of @xmath99 in a similar way : @xmath103 and an analogous expression holds for the left eigenvector @xmath104 of @xmath6 , using the left eigenvector of the matrix @xmath105 instead of @xmath99 .",
    "we will refer to eqs .",
    "( [ evp ] ) and ( [ uc ] ) as the _",
    "markovian approximation_.      while in many cases eq .",
    "( [ evp ] ) can be solved directly , it is also of interest to explore approximations to its solution .",
    "thus , we will here expand ( [ evp ] ) about a zero order approximation in which degree - degree correlations are neglected and in which the first order correction gives the perturbation to the uncorrelated case due to a small amount of degree - degree correlations .",
    "in particular , we will be interested in zeroth order and first order approximations to the largest eigenvalue of @xmath6 and to the corresponding right and left eigenvectors @xmath102 and @xmath104 , where @xmath107 following previously used terminology , we refer to the zeroth approximation as the _ mean field theory_.    when there are no neighbor degree - degree correlations , @xmath87 becomes independent of @xmath82 : @xmath108 where @xmath81 is the degree distribution .",
    "we will expand eq .",
    "( [ evp ] ) about the uncorrelated case . for this purpose",
    ", we will write @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath106 is an expansion parameter that we formally consider small , although , in reality , @xmath111 . introducing expansions for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , @xmath112 @xmath113 expanding eq .  ( [ evp ] ) to zero order in @xmath106 , we obtain @xmath114 and @xmath115 thus in the zeroth order approximation , the right eigenvector of @xmath6 has components @xmath116 to obtain the left eigenvector , we follow the same steps as above but with @xmath6 replaced by @xmath117 .",
    "this interchanges the roles of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , thus yielding @xmath118 for the left eigenvector .",

    "[ correlations ] , and we call @xmath126 the _ linear approximation_.    similarly , @xmath127    we now briefly comment on the range of validity of the expansion results . as the rigorous result eq .",
    "( [ chunga ] ) shows , the mean field result for undirected networks is not valid when the network is dominated by the node with maximum degree . a network",
    "in which the maximum degree is too large compared with the bulk of the degree distribution can not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ uncorre ] ) .",
    "for example , the star network of fig .",
    "[ nodo](a ) is very degree - degree correlated because all of its outer nodes connect only to the high degree hub node and , indeed , application of eq .",
    "( [ uncorre ] ) to this simple star network yields an incorrect result . our expansions about an uncorrelated network therefore implicitly assumed that this network was not dominated by the node with maximum degree .",
    "we speculate that directed networks might satisfy eq .",
    "( [ mefe ] ) with a less restrictive condition on the maximum degrees , as argued in sec .",
    "[ correlations ] and fig .",
    "[ nodo ] . a more rigorous delineation of the range of validity of the markovian approximation for correlated and/or directed networks along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite is open for further research .",
    "in this section we numerically construct random networks and use them to compare with the predictions of sec .  [ corre ] .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to networks which are not dominated by nodes with large degree , as discussed at the end of sec .",
    "[ expansion ] . in order to study the variation of the largest eigenvalue @xmath7 of the adjacency matrix @xmath6",
    ", we first construct large ( @xmath128 ) approximately uncorrelated networks with a given expected degree distribution using a generalization of the random graph model of chung _ et al .",
    "first we associate to each node @xmath129 target in and out degrees @xmath130 , where @xmath131 .",
    "note that the choice of target node degrees can be made to correspond to a desired degree distribution ( e.g. , scale free , or poisson ) .",
    "we then choose each element of the adjacency matrix @xmath2 randomly to be one with probability @xmath132 and zero otherwise .",
    "this determines a network realization with in and out degrees @xmath133 and @xmath134 . in general",
    ", @xmath135 can be different from the target values @xmath130 . nevertheless , with high probability , for large @xmath0",
    ", the resulting degree distribution @xmath136 of this randomly chosen network will be approximately , in a suitable sense , the target distribution @xcite .",
    "in particular , the moments @xmath137 and @xmath138 will be approximately unchanged when calculated using either @xmath139 or the target degrees .",
    "furthermore , @xmath140 for @xmath128 .",
    "the network generated by this algorithm is directed ( i.e. , @xmath6 is asymmetric ) ; symmetric networks can be generated by first considering only @xmath141 and then setting @xmath142 .",
    "starting from an uncorrelated network generated by this algorithm , we then rewire the connections in such a way that the degree distribution is preserved . on doing so , the correlation coefficient changes and we calculate the largest eigenvalue for different values of @xmath53 . the rewiring algorithm we use is a simplified version of that used in @xcite and consists of the repeated iteration of the following steps :    1 .",
    "two edges are chosen at random .",
    "assume one connects node @xmath143 to node @xmath92 and the other connects node @xmath3 to node @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath144 the two edges chosen in step @xmath42 are replaced with two edges connecting node @xmath143 to node @xmath4 and node @xmath3 to node @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ rewire ] ) if @xmath145 , and are left alone otherwise . setting @xmath146 or @xmath147",
    "we produce assortative or disassortative networks , respectively .",
    "as we iterate from @xmath148 with @xmath146 @xmath149 , @xmath53 steadily increases ( decreases ) .",
    "thus , we produce a sequence of networks with successively larger ( smaller ) @xmath53 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] a ) we show the largest eigenvalue @xmath7 ( solid line ) , the linear approximation given by eq .",

    "there is no discernible difference between the approximation @xmath98 and the actual values of @xmath7 .",
    "we observe that the largest eigenvalue depends strongly on the correlation coefficient : in the undirected case , it increases more than three times as @xmath53 varies from @xmath155 to @xmath156 .",
    "also , we see that in these examples the linear approximation works for @xmath157 , but fails for larger values of @xmath158 . in the undirected case , @xmath7 is larger than the linear approximation , which follows from eq .",

    "( [ uc ] ) using an arbitrary scale .",
    "there is good agreement between the true value and its markov estimate .",
    "in this paper we have considered several approximations to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of large , directed networks . the mean field result ( [ mefi ] ) appears to apply well to networks whose neighboring nodes are uncorrelated in their degrees .",
    "the linear approximation ( [ linear ] ) applies for sufficiently small correlation , while the markov model ( [ evp ] ) applies for arbitrarily strong degree correlations between neighbors .",
    "the price to be paid for a more refined approximation is the requirement of greater knowledge of the network ( e.g. , use of ( [ evp ] ) requires knowledge of @xmath163 which is not required for the two other less refined approximations ) .",
    "we caution that , although we have obtained good agreement between the theory and numerical results on simulated networks , this may not necessarily carry through for real networks encountered in practice .",
    "in particular , the markov assumption of eq .",
    "( [ psis ] ) may not always hold ( e.g. , due to community structure @xcite , clustering , or degree correlations extending over more than one link between nodes ) .",
