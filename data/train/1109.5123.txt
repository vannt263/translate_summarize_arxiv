    "the spectra of most optically - selected quasars are marked by strong , broad emission lines in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) band .",
    "however , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) has , so far , discovered @xmath0 quasars at @xmath1 with weak or undetectable rest - frame uv emission lines ( hereafter weak - lined quasars , or wlqs ) , starting with the prototype sdss  j153259.96@xmath2003944.1 ( fan et al .",

    "such wlqs can be defined as sources having rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of @xmath3  for the ly@xmath4@xmath5 emission complex ; this threshold represents the @xmath6 limit at the low - ew end of the lognormal distribution of ew[ly@xmath4@xmath5 ] in @xmath8 sdss quasars ( ds09 ) . due to their largely featureless spectra , the redshifts of these sources",
    "can only be determined reliably from the onset of the ly@xmath4  forest ( i.e. , ) .",
    "the discovery of wlqs only at @xmath1 is clearly a selection effect , as the onset of the ly@xmath4  forest emerges in the sdss spectral range at that redshift . indeed , there are indications for a population of lower - redshift sources with similar characteristics to the high - redshift wlq population ( e.g. , mcdowell et al .  1995 ;",

    "2007a ; hryniewicz et al .",
    "2010 , plotkin et al .",
    "2010b ) .    since their discovery",
    ", a number of scenarios have been proposed to explain the properties of these remarkable objects , although many have been subsequently shown to be unlikely .",
    "for example , wlqs are unlikely to be broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars , as their spectra do not show obvious broad absorption features .",
    "in addition , shemmer et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter s06 ) show that wlqs are not likely to be active galactic nuclei ( agns ) where emission lines have been obscured by dust and that they are not normal galaxies with luminosities that have been amplified by gravitational lensing .",
    "spectroscopic monitoring of four wlqs further suggests that it is unlikely that the weakness of their lines can be explained by microlensing that temporarily and preferentially amplifies the continuum relative to the broad emission lines ( ds09 ) .",
    "instead , s06 proposed that wlqs are either the long - sought , high - redshift counterparts to bl lacertae ( bl lac ) objects ( e.g. , stocke & perrenod 1981 ) or that they are ` ordinary ' unbeamed , unobscured quasars with extreme properties such as a deficit of line - emitting gas in the broad emission line region ( belr ) or an extremely high accretion rate ( see also fan et al .",
    "it has also been speculated that wlqs may represent an early or transitional phase in quasar evolution where quasar activity just recently ` switched on ' ( hryniewicz et al .",
    "2010 ; see also liu & zhang 2011 ) .",
    "classical bl lac objects are a rare class of agns with nearly featureless spectra that are radio loud ,  strong , polarized , and highly variable .",
    "all these characteristics are attributed to the fact that bl lacs are agns viewed along their powerful , narrow jets ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ) . in particular ,",
    "the nearly featureless spectrum of bl lacs is a consequence of relativistically - boosted synchrotron emission from the jet that overwhelms the characteristic agn emission lines .",
    "in contrast , wlqs are , at most , radio- and -intermediate , exhibiting only minimal overlap with the radio- and -weak tails of the bl lac population ( e.g. , shemmer et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter s09 ) . furthermore , unlike bl lacs",
    ", wlqs do not display significant polarization or variability ( ds09 ) .",
    "these properties alone are a strong , but not conclusive , argument against the bl lac hypothesis for explaining the weak lines in wlqs , given that radio - quiet bl lac objects must be extraordinarily rare , if they exist at all ( stocke et al .  1990 , and",
    "see also januzzi et al .",
    "1993 , londish et al .",
    "2004 , and plotkin et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "the ` bl lac ' and ` extreme quasar ' scenarios provide differing predictions for the shape of the uv - to - mid - infrared ( ir ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of wlqs .",
    "the bl lac emission in this range is mostly due to synchrotron emission ; the synchrotron radiation peaks either in the uv / soft-  bands for high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) , or in the near - ir band for low - energy peaked bl lacs ( lbls ; e.g. , padovani & giommi 1995 ; fossati et al .  1998 ;",
    "nieppola et al .",
    "the prominent lbl near - ir peak dominates the uv - to - mid - ir sed , while an hbl - like sed in this spectral range is characterized by a power - law representing the tail of the synchrotron peak .",
    "in contrast , ordinary quasars seds display the characteristic ` dip ' at @xmath9 m between the emissions from the disk and the circumnuclear heated dust ( e.g. , elvis et al .",
    "ds09 traced the uv - to - mid - ir seds of four wlqs ( sdss  j1302@xmath50030 at @xmath10 , sdss  j1408@xmath50205 at @xmath11 , sdss  j1442@xmath50110 at @xmath10 , and sdss  j1532@xmath20039 at @xmath12 ) using _ spitzer _",

    "we extend the near - to - mid - ir photometry to a statistically representative sample of 18 wlqs , including the four ds09 sources , and present conclusive evidence against the possibility that a relativistically - boosted continuum dilutes the wlq line emission .",

    "we do not have any evidence for significant suppression of ir continuum emission in our wlqs .",
    "in fact , the seds of wlqs and ordinary quasars are nearly indistinguishable in the rest - frame band across broad luminosity and redshift ranges for the ordinary quasars ; any remaining differences disappear when more comparable luminosity and redshift ranges are considered . moreover , the  properties of at least a subset of our wlqs are similar to the  properties of ordinary quasars with comparable luminosities ( s09 ) .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the distributions of the normalized accretion rates ( in terms of the eddington luminosity ratio , @xmath123 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 represent the bolometric and eddington luminosities , respectively ) of wlqs and ordinary quasars are similar as well .",

    "_  observations of 14 high - redshift ( @xmath143 ) quasars with weak or undetectable emission lines in their rest - frame uv spectra ( wlqs ) as well as new ground - based , near - ir photometry of two of these sources . together with archival _",
    "spitzer _  and near - ir photometry as well as rest - frame uv spectroscopy , these observations allowed us to trace the uv - mid - ir seds ( i.e. , @xmath142 m ) of a statistically representative sample of 18 of the known wlqs .",
    "all the seds show a clear indication of a typical quasar near - to - mid - ir heated - dust ` bump ' and they are well represented by a model consisting of a power law plus blackbody ; the ranges of best - fit power - law indices ( @xmath144 ) and blackbody temperatures ( @xmath145 ) are comparable to the ranges observed in seds of ordinary quasars .",
    "we find that all individual seds are inconsistent with a relativistically - boosted continuum that might have been expected if wlqs would have been associated with bl lacertae objects . by comparing a composite wlq sed of 17 sources ( i.e. , excluding sdss  j1207@xmath55953 that has a hint of a bal trough ) with composite seds of ordinary quasars with matched luminosities and redshifts ,",
    "we conclude that wlqs are unbeamed quasars and that their uv emission lines are intrinsically weak .",
    "the similarity in broad - band continuum properties between wlqs and ordinary quasars , in contrast with the significant differences between their uv emission - line strengths , suggests that wlqs can only be selected efficiently in spectroscopic surveys .",
    "we discuss different scenarios for explaining the weakness of the uv lines in wlqs , mainly extremely high accretion rates or abnormal broad emission line regions , and describe additional observations required to test both hypotheses .",
