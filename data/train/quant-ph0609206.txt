    "the propagation of a light pulse through a dispersive medium has been extensively investigated  @xcite .",
    "recently the amplitude and the phase control of the group velocity in a transparent media have attracted much attention .",
    "it is well known that the propagation velocity of a light pulse can be slowed down  @xcite , can become greater than the light propagation velocity in vacuum , or even negative in transparent media  @xcite .",
    "superluminal light propagation is a phenomenon in which the group velocity of an optical pulse in a dispersive medium is greater than of the light in vacuum . despite the name superluminal light",
    ", it is generally believed that no information can be sent faster than light speed @xmath0 in vacuum as explained by chiao  @xcite .",
    "thus , a group velocity faster than @xmath0 as reported here does not violate einstein principle of special relativity .",
    "the superluminal light propagation has been investigated for many potential uses , not only as a tool for studying a very peculiar state of matter , but also for developing quantum computers , high speed optical switches and communication systems  @xcite .",
    "there have been only few experimental and theoretical studies which realized both superluminal and subluminal light propagation in a single system .",
    "talukder et al .",
    "have shown femtosecond laser pulse propagation from superluminal to subluminal velocities in an absorbing dye by changing the dye concentration  @xcite .",
    "shimizu et al . were also able to control a light pulse speed , with only a few cold atoms in a high - finesse microcavity by detuning the laser frequency from a cavity resonance frequency - locked to the atomic transition  @xcite .",
    "most schemes for a speed control in atomic systems involve changing the frequency , amplitude or phase difference of the applied fields .",
    "it was shown that switching from subluminal to superluminal pulse propagation can be achieved via the intensity of coupling field  @xcite , and via the relative phase between two weak probe fields  @xcite .",
    "the intensity control of group velocity has been attempted by using a lower level - coupling field in the three - level atomic system  @xcite . in another study ,",
    "a scheme based on four - level electromagnetically induced transparency for switching from subluminal to superluminal light propagation via relative phase between driving fields was introduced  @xcite .",
    "recently we have used an incoherent pump field to control the light propagation from subluminal to superluminal  @xcite .",
    "further , we have studied the propagation of light pulses in three - level closed laser - interaction loop atomic systems , where we exploited the fact that changing the relative phase between applied fields can modify the absorption and dispersion properties of the medium  @xcite .",
    "the double-@xmath1 setup is another scheme which allows for a closed laser - field interaction loop and provides a very rich spectrum of phenomena based on atomic coherence .",
    "one reason for this are the various interfering excitation channels in such a system  @xcite .",
    "the double @xmath1 system has been investigated in the content of amplification without inversion  @xcite , phase sensitive laser cooling  @xcite , the propagation of the pairs of optical pulses  @xcite , optical phase conjugation  @xcite , phase control of photoionization  @xcite , phase control of electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite and coherent population trapping @xcite .",
    "recently morigi et al  @xcite have compared the phase - dependent properties of the @xmath2 ( diamond ) four level system with those of the double @xmath1 system .",
    "the propagation of light in a double @xmath1 medium was studied earlier in ref  @xcite .",
    "the authors considered the case of complete resonance and the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) condition initially fulfilled , and found the possibility of amplification of one of the frequency pairs .",
    "korsunsky et al .",
    "present a theory of a continuous wave light propagation in a medium of atoms with a double @xmath1 configuration  @xcite .",
    "they have shown that , when the so - called multiphoton resonance condition is fulfilled , both absorptive and dispersive properties of a such a medium depends on the relative phase of the driving fields .",
    "( color online ) the four - level double-@xmath1 type schemes considered in the analysis .",
    "( a ) is driven by four laser fields indicated by the red arrows with rabi frequencies @xmath3 ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) that form a closed interaction loop .",
    "this loop gives rise to a dependence on the relative phase of the different laser fields , and in general makes a time - independent steady state of the system dynamics impossible .",
    "( b ) is the corresponding level scheme where one of the driving fields has been removed ( @xmath6 ) . here",
    ", the laser fields do not form a closed loop .",
    "the spontaneous decays with rates @xmath7 ( @xmath8,@xmath9 ) are denoted by the wiggly green lines .",
    ", width=302 ]    a peculiarity of the closed laser interaction loop systems is the fact that a certain initial atomic state is connected to another atomic state via several combinations of laser field interactions . on the one hand , this gives rise to a dependence of the optical properties of the system on the relative phase of the driving fields .",
    "this allows for a great control of the optical properties and has been exploited in various circumstances , as discussed above .",
    "the drawback , however , is that such a system in general does not have a time - independent steady state .",
    "a time - independent steady state is reached only if a particular linear combination of the detunings of all incident laser fields is zero , that is , if the so - called multiphoton resonance condition is fulfilled .",
    "this assumption was made in the previous studies .",
    "but for a meaningful definition of the group velocity of a probe pulse in a given medium , one has to require that the medium itself including the coupling fields , which in this context merely aid in the preparation of the medium , has properties independent of the probe pulse characteristics . while the probe pulse which is finite in time necessarily consists of different frequency components and thus interacts with the atom with different detunings , the coupling fields have to be kept fixed in the calculation of the probe field propagation , since the different frequency components interact with the medium simultaneously . in particular , it is not possible to adjust one of the coupling field detunings such that the multiphoton resonance condition is maintained throughout the pulse propagation .",
    "thus , it is impossible to assume the multiphoton resonance condition in the evaluation of the propagation of a finite probe pulse , and a time - dependent analysis is required .",
    "therefore in this paper , we investigate the light propagation in a four - level double lambda system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - system](a ) both with and without assuming the multiphoton resonance condition .",
    "we apply laser fields to all four dipole - allowed transitions to generate a closed laser - interaction loop . in the time - independent case where the multiphoton resonance condition is fulfilled , we find sub- and superluminal light propagation , controlled simply by the relative phase of the driving fields . for the time - dependent study beyond the multiphoton resonance condition , we apply a floquet decomposition to the in general time dependent equations of motion . by comparing the floquet decomposition to the time - independent treatment ,",
    "we identify the respective frequency components found in this expansion with different interaction pathways in the closed loop system .",
    "we find that the medium response oscillating in phase with the probe field in general is not phase - dependent .",
    "the phase - dependent process contributing to the probe field susceptibility only occurs at a specific frequency , and is thus likely to distort the shape of a short probe pulse considerably if this specific frequency is contained in the wide frequency spectrum of the short pulse .",
    "thus we conclude that for parameters violating the multiphoton resonance condition as in the probe pulse propagation , inducing a closed loop interaction contour may not be advantageous .",
    "nevertheless , we demonstrate that also under conditions without a closed loop as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - system](b ) , both sub- and superluminal light propagation is possible with gain . finally , we identify the rabi frequency of one of the coupling fields as a convenient control parameter which allows to switch between sub- and superluminal light propagation .",
    "we consider a four - level atomic systems in a double-@xmath1 configuration as depicted in figure  [ fig - system ] .",
    "the scheme consists of two metastable lower states @xmath10 , @xmath11 and two excited states @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the electric - dipole allowed transitions @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are driven by three coherent laser fields , while a weak tunable coherent probe field with central frequency @xmath17 is applied to the dipole - allowed transition @xmath18 .",
    "the spontaneous decay rates from level @xmath19 ( @xmath4 ) to the levels @xmath20 ( @xmath5 ) are denoted by @xmath21 .",

    "note that we do not assume absolute phase control in our calculations , but only relative phase control between the different driving fields .",
    "the hamiltonian in dipole and rotating wave approximation is given by  @xcite @xmath29 where the corresponding rabi frequencies are denoted by @xmath30 with @xmath31 as the atomic dipole moment of the corresponding transition .",
    "the energies of the involved states are denoted @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) , and we define the transition frequencies @xmath34 .",
    "the arguments of the exponential functions are given by @xmath35 in a suitable reference frame , the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath36 here , we have defined @xmath37 and the corresponding operator in the new reference frame is denoted by @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . it is interesting to note that now the residual time dependence along with the laser field phases appears only together with the probe field rabi frequency @xmath40 in the parameter @xmath41 given by    [ phi ] @xmath42    the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are known as the multiphoton resonance detuning , wave vector mismatch and initial phase difference , respectively .",
