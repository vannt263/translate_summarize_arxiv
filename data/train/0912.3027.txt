    "the goal of this paper is to give a new view on the kowalevski top and the kowalevski integration procedure . for more than a century",
    ", the kowalevski 1889 case @xcite , attracts the full attention of a wide community as the highlight of the classical theory of integrable systems . despite hundreds of papers on the subject ,",
    "the kowalevski integration is still understood as a magic recipe , an unbelievable sequence of skilful tricks , unexpected identities and smart changes of variables ( see for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the novelty of this paper is based on our four observations .",
    "the first one is that the so - called fundamental kowalevski equation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath2 is an instance of a pencil equation from the theory of conics .",
    "this leads us to a new interpretation of the kowalevski variables @xmath0 as the pencil parameter and the darboux coordinates respectively . origins and classical applications of the darboux coordinates can be found in darboux s book @xcite , while some modern application can be found in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second is observation of the key algebraic property of the pencil equation : _ all three of its discriminants are expressed as products of two polynomials in one variable each _ : @xmath3 this serves us as a motivation to introduce a new class of what we call * discriminantly separable polynomials*. we develop the theory of such polynomials .",
    "all steps of the kowalevski integration now follow as easy and transparent logical consequences of our theory of the discriminantly separable polynomials .",
    "the third observation connects the kowalevski integration and the pencil equation with the theory of multivalued groups .",
    "the theory of multivalued groups started in the beginning of 1970 s by buchstaber and novikov ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it has been further developed by buchstaber and his collaborators in last forty years ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the kowalevski change of variables is now recognized as a case of two - valued group operation @xmath4 and its action , where @xmath5 is an elliptic curve and @xmath6 its subgroup .",
    "our final observation is surprising equivalence of the associativity condition for this two - valued group operation to a case of the great poncelet theorem for triangles .",
    "well - known mechanical interpretation of the great poncelet theorem is connected with integrable billiards , see for example @xcite .",
    "the great poncelet theorem is the milestone of the theory of pencils of conics and the whole classical projective geometry ( see @xcite , and also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , as the kowalevski top is the milestone of the classical integrable systems .",
    "now we manage to relate them closely . as a consequence",
    ", we get a new connection between great poncelet theorem and integrable mechanical systems , this time from rigid- body dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section [ sec : prel ] starts with a subsection devoted to the pencils of conics and the darboux coordinates .",
    "we derive the key property of the pencil equation - discriminant separability . in the second subsection",
    ", we formally introduce the class of discriminanlty separable polynomials and systematically study this class .    in the section [ sec : kow ]",
    "we show how the kowalevski case is embedded into our more general framework .",
    "a new geometric interpretation of the kowalevski variables @xmath7 as the pencil parameter and the darboux coordinates is obtained .    in the section [ sec : genintsys ]",
    "general systems are defined , related to the general equation of the pencil .",
    "the kowalevski top can be seen as a special subcase .",
    "the first integrals are studied .",
    "their properties are related to the properties of discriminantly separable polynomials , obtained in section [ sec : prel ] .",
    "it was done by use of what we call the kotter trick ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of this transformation is going to be clarified in the last section [ sec : dvg ] through the theory of multivalued groups .",
    "then , we manage to generalize another kotter s transformation and this gives us a possibility to integrate the general system defined at the beginning of this section .",
    "we reduce the problem to the functions @xmath8 .",
    "the evolution of those functions in terms of the theta - functions was obtained by kowalevski herself in @xcite . a modern account of the theta - functions and their applications to",
    "nonlinear equations one can find for example in @xcite",
    ".    the last section [ sec : dvg ] is devoted to two - valued groups and their connection with the kowalevski top and the great poncelet theorem . in order to make",
    "the text self - contained as much as possible , we start the section with brief introduction to the theory of multivalued groups , following works of buchstaber and his co - workers .",
    "the main role is played by two - valued coset group obtained from an elliptic curve @xmath5 and its subgroup @xmath9 .",
    "it appears that the kowalevski change of variables has its naturale expression through this two - valued group and its action .",
    "these results complete the picture obtained before by weil in @xcite and jurdjevic @xcite . within this framework",
    ", we give an explanation of the kotter trick , as we promised in section [ sec : genintsys ] .",
    "finally , we show that the associativity condition for the two - valued group @xmath10 is equivalent to the famous great poncelet theorem ( @xcite ) in its basic @xmath1 case .",
    "let us start with two conics @xmath11 and @xmath12 given by their tangential equations : @xmath13 we assume that conics @xmath11 and @xmath12 are in general position . consider the pencil @xmath14 of conics @xmath15 .",
    "the conics from the pencil share four common tangents .",
    "the coordinate equation of the conics of the pencil is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a bordered matrix of the form @xmath18\\ ] ] then the point equation of the pencil of conics @xmath14 is of the form of the quadratic polynomial in @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are quadratic expressions in @xmath24 .",
    "following darboux ( see @xcite ) , we introduce a new system of coordinates in the plane . given a plane with standard coordinates @xmath25 , we start from the given conic @xmath12 .",
    "the conic is given by the equation ( [ eq : conics ] ) and it is rationally parameterized by @xmath26 .",
    "the tangent line to the conic @xmath12 through the point with the parameter @xmath27 is given by the equation @xmath28 on the other hand , for a given point @xmath29 in the plane with coordinates @xmath30 there correspond two solutions @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the equation quadratic in @xmath33 : @xmath34 each solution corresponds to a tangent to the conic @xmath12 from the point @xmath29 .",
    "we will call the pair @xmath35 _ the darboux coordinates _ of the point @xmath29 .",
    "one finds immediately converse formulae @xmath36 we change the variables in the polynomial @xmath37 from projective coordinates @xmath38 to the darboux coordinates according to the formulae [ eq : viet ] . in the new coordinates we get the formulae : @xmath39 we may notice for further references that @xmath40 now , the polynomial @xmath41 is of the second degree in each of variables @xmath19 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and it is symmetric in @xmath35 .",
    "it has one * very exceptional property * , as described in the next theorem .    for a polynomial @xmath42 of variables",
    "@xmath43 we will denote its discriminant with respect to the variable @xmath44 by @xmath45 which is a polynomial of the rest of the variables @xmath46 .",
    "[ th : discrimsep ]    * there exists a polynomial @xmath47 such that the discriminant of the polynomial @xmath37 in @xmath19 as a polynomial in variables @xmath31 and @xmath32 separates the variables : @xmath48 * there exists a polynomial @xmath49 such that the discriminant of the polynomial @xmath37 in @xmath32 as a polynomial in variables @xmath31 and @xmath19 separates the variables : @xmath50 due to the symmetry between @xmath31 and @xmath32 the last statement remains valid after exchanging the places of @xmath31 and @xmath32 .    * a general point belongs to two conics of a tangential pencil .",
    "if a point belongs to only one conic , then it belongs to one of the four common tangents of the pencil . at such a point , this unique conic touches one of the four common tangents .",
    "thus , the equation @xmath51 which represents the condition of annulation of the discriminant , is the equation of the four common tangents . thus , the equation [ eq : discsep3 ] is equivalent to the system @xmath52 where @xmath53 are parameters which correspond to the points of contact of the four common tangents with the conic @xmath12 . as a consequence ,",
    "we get @xmath54 where the polynomial @xmath29 is of the fourth degree and of the form @xmath55 this proves the first part of the theorem .",
    "+ the second part of the theorem follows from the following lemma .",
    "+ [ lemma : discsep ] given a polynomial @xmath56 of the second degree in each of its variables in the form : @xmath57 if there are polynomials @xmath58 and @xmath59 of the fourth degree such that @xmath60 then there exists a polynomial @xmath61 such that @xmath62 + to prove the lemma , rewrite the equation ( [ eq : discsep4 ] ) in the equivalent form @xmath63 for a zero @xmath64 of the polynomial @xmath58 , any zero of @xmath65 as a polynomial in @xmath66 is a double zero , according to the last equation .",
    "thus , @xmath67 is a zero of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the polynomial @xmath58 is a factor of the polynomial @xmath68 .",

    "the second part follows by direct calculation of correspondence between two elliptic curves , one of which is defined by a polynomial of degree 3 and one by polynomial of degree 4 .",
