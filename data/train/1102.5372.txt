    "several properties of the negatively - charged nitrogen - vacancy center ( nv@xmath0 ) in diamond make it an attractive candidate as a qubit for quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "first , the ground - state electron - spin decoherence time exceeds a millisecond in isotopically purified @xmath1c diamond samples  @xcite .",
    "second , an excited - state manifold  @xcite provides optical access to both initialize and control the electron ground - state spin  @xcite as well as a way to create quantum entanglement through photon interference  @xcite .",
    "finally , hyperfine coupling of the electron spin to either n or @xmath2c nuclear spins  @xcite provides access to a second storage qubit needed for quantum protocols based on repeat until success schemes  @xcite .",
    "the majority of nv@xmath0  experiments have been performed on nv centers found deep within the diamond substrate utilizing free - space excitation and collection optics .",
    "there is now significant motivation to integrate these quantum emitters into optical devices to build scalable measurement - based optical quantum networks . to realize these networks coupling nv@xmath0  centers to optical cavities",
    "will be necessary to enhance emission into the zero - phonon line ( zpl )  @xcite and for coupling zpl emission into waveguides for efficient collection .",
    "nv - cavity coupling can be obtained by coupling nv centers in diamond nanoparticles to non - diamond microcavities  @xcite , coupling nv centers in single - crystal diamond to non - diamond cavities ( hybrid approach )  @xcite , and by fabricating microcavities out of single - crystal diamond ( all - diamond approach )  @xcite . due to the poor spectral properties of nv centers found in nano - diamond , the first approach is challenging for scalable optical networks that rely on interference for ` which - path ' erasure .",
    "of the single - crystal diamond approaches , the all - diamond approach has the advantage of a higher optical field strength at the nv site which lies within the cavity structure , and significant enhancement of the nv emission into the zpl has already been observed in all - diamond microrings  @xcite .",
    "the hybrid approach , which relies on coupling diamond nvs to the evanescent field extending out of the non - diamond cavity , has the potential advantage of additional device functionality provided by the material properties of the waveguide layer .",
    "for example , the electro - optic properties of the cavity material could enable switching or cavity tuning capabilities .",
    "a figure of merit for the coupling between a cavity mode and dipole emitter is the spontaneous emission enhancement ( purcell ) factor @xmath3 . for an emitter at position @xmath4 in a monolithic cavity and on resonance with the cavity mode , @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the vacuum wavelength , @xmath7 is the cavity refractive index , @xmath8 is the cavity mode quality factor , @xmath9 is the cavity mode volume , @xmath10 is the electric field strength at the dipole , and @xmath11 is the maximum electric field strength .",
    "there are several key device factors that must be optimized .",
    "the optical cavity quality factor @xmath8 must be sufficiently large and its mode volume @xmath9 sufficiently small .",
    "the quantum emitter must be coupled spatially to the cavity mode and spectrally on resonance . finally , in addition to cavity - dipole coupling , the cavity mode",
    "must be efficiently coupled to a useful input / output mode ( i.e. a waveguide ) .",
    "when engineering optical devices for qip applications , device testing becomes prohibitively difficult when all testing must be done on single emitters .",
    "this is especially true in the common case where the spectral and spatial properties of the emitter are difficult to control . in this work",
    "we develop a test platform based on emitter ensembles designed to evaluate coupled emitter - cavity performance .",
    "this platform is particularly useful for hybrid - type devices in which the material properties of the waveguide layer may need to be tested before investing the resources necessary to test single - emitter devices .    in this work we focus on coupling an ensemble of near - surface nv@xmath0  centers in single crystal diamond to gap micro - cavities fabricated through photolithographic and dry - etching techniques .",
    "we show that it is possible using a tapered fiber to collect emission preferentially from centers that are coupled to the cavity  @xcite .",
    "we are able to deterministically tune the cavity resonance several nanometers onto the  nv@xmath0  zpl and perform lifetime measurements using the photoluminescence ( pl ) collected through the tapered fiber .",
    "the lifetime measurements can be used to evaluate nv - device coupling .",
    "although we are experimentally unable to observe a significant reduction in the ensemble lifetime for these particular devices , we demonstrate the feasibility of the testing method and theoretically show that there is a significant advantage to using the tapered fiber over free - space collection in ensemble measurements .",
    "the tested devices consisted of a gap microcavity on top of a diamond pedestal with an ensemble of nvs near the diamond surface ( fig .  [ fig : devices]a ) .",
    "gap has a refractive index of @xmath12 that is higher than that of diamond ( @xmath13 ) , and it is transparent at 637 nm , the zpl wavelength .",
    "thus devices made from gap on diamond can support high - q modes that couple evanescently to the nv centers near the diamond surface .",
    "experiments were performed on a a commercially available type iia ( 110)-oriented diamond chip ( element 6 ) grown by chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) with a nitrogen concentration of [ n]@xmath141  ppm as specified by the manufacturer .",
    "the nv ensemble was created by n@xmath15 ion implantation at 10  kev ( core systems ) at a dose of @xmath16  @xmath17 followed by a one hour high temperature anneal at 900  @xmath18c in a h@xmath19/ar forming gas . to maximize the fraction of nv centers in a negatively - charged state , the sample was further annealed in an oxygen atmosphere at 465  @xmath18c for 2 hours  @xcite . in this sample",
    "there are three mechanisms of nv formation .",
    "first , nvs are incorporated during the cvd growth process .",
    "the density of these nvs is expected to be less than @xmath20  @xmath21  @xcite and thus their contribution to the total collected signal can be neglected . a second way an nv is formed is when a vacancy created by the implantation process diffuses and is trapped by a native nitrogen during the annealing process .",
    "the maximum nv density due to this process is 2@xmath22  @xmath21 based on electron irradiation studies aimed at maximizing the nv@xmath0  yield in similar cvd material  @xcite .",
    "these nvs are located within the first 200  nm of the surface  @xcite and have a maximum sheet density of @xmath23  @xmath17 .",
    "finally , an nv can form when a vacancy is trapped by implanted nitrogen .",
    "this third type of nv is expected to be @xmath24  nm from the surface , as estimated using srim  @xcite .",
    "the estimated sheet density is @xmath25  @xmath17 assuming a 10% conversion rate of implanted ions to nv@xmath0  which is typical in our devices . even for free - space collection",
    "the majority of the nv pl signal is due to the implanted nitrogen . by using a tapered fiber we are able to further select nvs which are coupled to the cavity .",
    "we note that if an electronic - grade cvd diamond substrate ( [ n]@xmath141  ppb ) were used only the third type of nv would be present .",
    "the starting material for the gap microcavities was a commercially available ( iqe ) wafer consisting of a 250  nm gap layer on an 800  nm al@xmath26ga@xmath27p sacrificial layer grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "for one set of devices the original 250  nm thickness was used while in a second set the gap layer was thinned by dry etching to 150  nm .",
    "the microcavities were defined photolithographically using a mask consisting of 1.5 - 3  @xmath28 m diameter disks . the resist mask ( spr-955 )",
    "was reflowed on a hotplate at 180  @xmath18c and was used as an etch mask in an ar / bcl@xmath29/cl@xmath19 reactive ion etch ( rie ) chemistry . by varying the optical exposure time it was found that rings could also be produced due to diffraction around the disk mask .    as a further step to facilitate tapered - fiber testing , a 20  @xmath28 m tall",
    ", 190  @xmath28 m wide diamond ridge defined by a sin mask was etched on the diamond surface using an o@xmath19/ar rie chemistry .",
    "the gap microcavities were then transferred to the diamond ridge using the probabilistic `` drop - down '' method described in ref .",
    "this procedure provides an easy shortcut for testing single devices , but eventually this must be replaced with a wafer - bonding approach before integrated photonic networks can be constructed .",
    "after transfer the devices were etched in an oxygen rie plasma to create a 600  nm diamond pedestal beneath the gap disks . this pedestal improves the lateral confinement of the cavity modes , decreasing radiation loss into the diamond substrate  @xcite .    scanning electron microscope images of the two devices studied for this work",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : devices]b , c .",
    "device d1 consisted of a 250 nm thick , 1.5 micron diameter gap disk and device d2 consisted of a 150  nm thick , 280 nm wide , ring waveguide with a 1.6  @xmath28 m outer diameter .",
    "these devices were examples of the smallest devices made and had cavity resonances within tuning distance of the nv@xmath0  zpl .",
    "a 550  nm@xmath30  nm diameter tapered fiber was used to collect nv photoluminescence from the hybrid gap - diamond cavities .",
    "the tapered fiber position was controlled by a piezo stage and contacted to the top or side of the gap microcavity to collect nv photoluminescence as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : devices]a .",
    "room - temperature transmission measurements were performed to characterize the fiber - microcavity coupling . only in the smallest disk devices ( sub-2  @xmath28 m diameter ) could transmission dips be observed as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taper]a . transmission dips ranging from a few percent to a few tens of percent could be attained .",
    "the utility of using a tapered fiber for device evaluation depends critically on the collection efficiency , especially in the case of single centers .",
    "we have thus estimated the energy decay rate from the cavity mode into the waveguide as a function of device diameter numerically using coupled mode theory .",
    "we first simulated the uncoupled lowest order te and tm cavity modes for disk and ring devices using fdtd ( meep  @xcite ) .",
    "the fiber mode was calculated using well - known analytic expressions for a step - index circular waveguide  @xcite .",
    "the fiber diameter was taken to be 550  nm and the fiber index @xmath31 = 1.45 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an expression for the coupling rate between a cavity mode and fiber is derived using power conservation . using this formalism",
    ", one can show that the total decay rate of energy from the cavity into the fiber is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the cavity and fiber electric fields , respectively , and @xmath35 is the resonant frequency . the 2d integral is taken over the fiber cross section @xmath36 and the 1d integral is along the fiber propagation axis @xmath37 with @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "we have assumed that the cavity mode is a standing wave which decays equally into both forward and backward propagating waveguide modes .",
    "the cavity field is normalized to unit energy  @xcite , @xmath40 and the waveguide field is normalized to unit power , @xmath41 @xmath42(@xmath43 ) is the cavity ( fiber ) magnetic field and @xmath44 is the dielectric constant .",
    "the results of the coupled - mode calculation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taper]b for both ring and disk devices for a fiber in contact with the top of the device  ( fig .",

    "experimentally there is uncertainty in the fiber - cavity contact position , the extent of the fiber - cavity contact , the fiber diameter , and the the phase of the standing - waves . even with these uncertainties the simulations do provide some insight into how to achieve the best fiber - device coupling .",
    "as the device diameter becomes smaller it appears easiest to couple to the te modes from the side of the disk .",
    "the ring device in general provides better coupling due to the thinner gap layer .",
    "if we assume a reasonable cavity q of 10,000 , appreciable coupling ( decay rate due to the taper is greater than 10% of the uncoupled decay rate ) only occurs for device diameters less than 1.5  @xmath28 m . to be able to attain critical coupling in these geometries",
    "the device diameter would need to be sub - micron .",
    "such small devices are desirable for large purcell factors and could be fabricated using electron - beam lithography .",
    "there is however a fundamental limit on the minimum device diameter @xmath45 before q is limited by radiation loss , @xmath46 .",
    "ftdt calculations show that for gap - diamond hybrid devices this diameter can be quite small : for a 150  nm gap layer @xmath47  nm and for a 250  nm layer @xmath48  nm .",
    "nv photoluminescence spectra collected in free space from the center of disk d1 and collected through a tapered fiber coupled to the whispering - gallery modes of the cavity are shown in fig .",

    "collection is from the top of the disk through a 0.55 numerical aperture objective .",
    "the nv@xmath0  zpl line is observed at 637 nm with a 1.5  nm inhomogeneous linewidth .",
    "this inhomogeneity is generally observed in heavily implanted samples and could be a result of strain introduced during the implantation process . in the tapered fiber spectrum",
    "the disk is excited at its edge and the excitation spot is spatially separated from the tapered - fiber contact position .",
    "this is to reduce scatter from uncoupled nvs into the tapered fiber .",
    "the sharp cavity modes can clearly be observed over the background pl with a contrast greatly exceeding what can be achieved in free - space using spatial filtering  @xcite .    due to variations in device fabrication ,",
    "it is unlikely that a cavity mode will initially be on resonance with the 637 nm zero - phonon emission .",
    "temperature tuning is not useful in this system because the zpl becomes phonon broadened at temperatures greater than @xmath4915  k  @xcite .",
    "instead we tune the cavity by injecting xenon gas into the cryostat which condenses on the microcavity and alters its mode volume  @xcite .",
    "microdisk resonance tuning up to approximately 3  nm is possible for these gap devices which have a free spectral range exceeding 20  nm . it is thus necessary to fabricate many devices to ensure a subset of devices is within the tuning range .",
    "[ fig : tuning]b depicts a series of pl spectra from device d2 as xe is continuously leaked into the cryostat .",

    "the nv - cavity coupling strength can be determined from changes in the spontaneous emission lifetime that occur when the nv zpl is resonant with the cavity mode .",
    "the decay rate for a single nv center prepared in a particular excited state @xmath50 may be written as , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total uncoupled decay rate including nonradiative channels as well as spontaneous emission through other modes , @xmath53 is the zero - phonon spontaneous emission rate in bulk diamond , and @xmath54 is the purcell factor . in high - quality diamond samples typically @xmath55 , but in the present samples we observe @xmath56 , suggesting a strong non - radiative component .",
    "we have previously measured @xmath57 of the total nv@xmath0  photoluminescence intensity including the phonon sidebands which is consistent with the literature  @xcite . if @xmath58 represents a fraction @xmath59 of the total uncoupled decay rate @xmath52 then the ratio of the on - resonance lifetime @xmath60 to the uncoupled lifetime @xmath61 would be @xmath62    using the tapered - fiber collection , we measure the se decay curve of the cavity - coupled nv ensemble .",
    "this measurement , combined with a theoretical consideration of the effects of ensemble averaging , can be used to estimate the spontaneous emission enhancement of a single nv center with a particular position and orientation , as is discussed below .",

    "the se decay curves for devices d1 and d2 were fitted to a single exponential with decay times of @xmath63  ns and @xmath64  ns respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes]b , d ) . the measurement was repeated on nv centers that were not coupled to the cavity mode . to collect uncoupled emission",
    "the fiber was placed across the center of the device and the nv centers directly under the fiber were excited . as seen from the pl spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : lifetimes]a , c , in this excitation / collection geometry the zpl line is weak and broad and thus shows no features of the cavity mode . lifetime measurements of uncoupled nvs yielded characteristic decay times of @xmath65  ns and @xmath66  ns for d1 and d2 respectively .",
    "we show below that this lifetime reduction is somewhat smaller than what is expected theoretically .",
    "next , let us discuss the lifetime modification expected theoretically for a large ensemble of nv centers coupled to the cavity modes of device d2 .",
    "each nv center has a number of characteristics that affect its excited - state dynamics , including its position relative to the cavity mode , the orientation of the n - v axis along one of the four @xmath67 axes , the principle axes of symmetry breaking for the two excited orbital states as determined by local strain or electric fields , and the frequency shifts of the optical transitions , again determined by local fields .",
    "nonradiative decay channels may also be present , including decay through the singlet states ( especially from the @xmath68 spin sublevels  @xcite ) .    to simplify the discussion , here we neglect the dynamics of the spin sublevels , and consider only the two orbital excited states .",
    "such an approximation is not suitable for a detailed analysis of nv dynamics , but suffices to illustrate the effect of spatial and orientational inhomogeneity on the radiative dynamics . under this simplification",
    "we can use eq .",
    "[ eq : decayrate ] to model the decay rate for a single nv center prepared in a particular excited state @xmath50 , and we let @xmath69 . the purcell factor is given by , @xmath70 which is similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : purcell_simple1 ] except that we have included the factor of @xmath71 necessary for the hybrid geometry and also the effect of dipole alignment and spectral detuning . here , @xmath72 is the diamond refractive index and @xmath73 is a unit vector parallel to the relevant transition dipole moment .",
    "the hybrid - cavity mode volume is given by @xmath74 in which @xmath75 is the dielectric constant at the location of the field maximum  @xcite .",
    "the nv center has two optical transitions involving the two orbital excited states with dipole moments orthogonal to the @xmath67 n - v axes .",
    "the principle axes  @xcite can be described in terms of an angle @xmath76 ; for example for an nv oriented along @xmath77/\\sqrt{3}$ ] , the dipole moments are @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where @xmath80/\\sqrt{6}$ ] and @xmath81/\\sqrt{2}$ ] .",
    "if the angle @xmath76 is determined by local fields then we expect it to be randomly distributed , and here we assume a uniform distribution .",
    "it is important to note that we neglect population relaxation between orbital excited states .",
    "this assumption is reasonable only for measurements performed at liquid - helium temperatures  @xcite .",
    "we further assume that the two orbital excited states have the same unmodified decay rate . in general , we must also include the effect of detuning , and here @xmath82 is the detuning between the dipole transition frequency and the central frequency of the cavity mode , while @xmath83 is the cavity linewidth . in the measurement ,",
    "we detect photoluminescence through a spectral filter of @xmath84 bandwidth centered at the cavity frequency , and therefore we detect emission only from a subset of nv transitions that are nearly on resonance with the cavity mode .",
    "thus we set @xmath85 for the present calculation .",
    "while our model assumes a simple exponential decay for each nv transition , the ensemble - averaged behavior is non - exponential , but can be written as , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the measured pl decay curve , and @xmath88 represents a distribution of nv transitions with various purcell factors , decaying at various rates , weighted by their relative occurrence and by their excitation and collection efficiencies .",
    "for free - space collection this distribution can be written as , @xmath89 here , @xmath90 is the n - v orientation vector , and @xmath91 is the nv density with respect to position and dipole orientation . for the spatial dependence , we approximate @xmath92 as a gaussian distribution with respect to depth below the surface , with a mean depth of @xmath93 and variance ( straggle ) of @xmath94 . such a distribution corresponds to a uniform @xmath95 nitrogen ion implantation as estimated using srim  @xcite , assuming that the resulting nv centers incorporate only implanted nitrogen , and that the implanted nitrogen does not diffuse during annealing .",
    "the excitation efficiency @xmath96 includes a spatial dependence that is modeled as a diffraction - limited airy disk pattern corresponding to @xmath97 excitation through a 0.55 numerical - aperture lens ( @xmath98 ) , centered between the inner and outer edges of the ring structure .",
    "the excitation efficiency is also assumed to be proportional to @xmath99 , where the excitation polarization @xmath100 is along @xmath101 $ ] .    for collection through the tapered fiber ,",
    "eq.[eq : g_freespace ] must be modified since , ideally , only light emitted into the cavity mode of interest is collected .",
    "thus we weight by the emission rate into the cavity mode , which is proportional to the purcell factor : @xmath102    the lowest - radial order te cavity field was simulated for the calculation using fdtd ( meep ) software  @xcite . a reasonably good agreement between the experimental and simulated resonance frequencies could be obtained for a model device with a 1.8  @xmath28 m outer diameter as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] . using the parameters given above , setting @xmath103 and considering a single standing - wave cavity mode ( rather than",

    "the maximum expected purcell factor for an nv 15  nm below the surface and with perfect dipole alignment is @xmath104 .",
    "however , for free - space collection the weighted average is only @xmath105 . for collection through the tapered fiber , because we preferentially detect nv centers that are better coupled to the cavity mode , the average increases to @xmath106 .",
    "but even with the tapered fiber it is clear that the random spatial and angular distributions of dipole moments reduces the mean cavity enhancement by a large amount .    for a more direct comparison with experiment , pl",

    "[ fig : fp_dist]b . here",
    "we have assumed @xmath107 to match the behavior observed in these heavily implanted samples , and @xmath108 , as discussed above .",
    "although these decay curves do not follow a single - exponential time dependence , because the average decay modification is weak compared with @xmath52 , it would be quite difficult experimentally to detect the deviation from single - exponential behavior caused by variations in @xmath3 .",
    "the effective decay lifetimes obtained by fitting the first @xmath109 of decay to a single exponential are @xmath110 and @xmath111 for free - space and tapered - fiber collection , respectively .",
    "these are approximately equal to those expected from the @xmath112 values given above : @xmath113 and @xmath114 for free - space and tapered - fiber collection , respectively . fig .",

    "[ fig : lifetimes ] , which was at the limit of detection , is smaller than that predicted in this simulation , and some likely causes include the presence of an air gap between the gap ring  @xcite and the diamond surface , or non - ideal nv distributions .",
    "the simulations show that collection using the tapered fiber provides an important advantage since it selectively filters out nv centers that are poorly coupled to the cavity .",
    "nevertheless , even using the tapered fiber for collection , ensemble averaging reduces the effective purcell factor by a factor of approximately 3 compared with that expected for an ideally positioned and oriented nv center .",
    "there is significant motivation to integrate photonics with quantum systems for quantum communication , quantum information interfaces , and for quantum information processing . in final devices ,",
    "quantum - photonic `` nodes '' will consist of single emitters , however single emitters are challenging to work with when studying and developing the classical photonic networks .",

    "experimentally we showed that tapered - fiber collection provides a way to obtain high - contrast spectra to reliably observe cavity modes .",
    "this is because the fiber enables the selective detection of nvs coupled to the cavity .",
    "compared to a free - space collection , the measurement more directly probes the signal that would be collected by an on - chip waveguide , as part of an integrated photonic network . although not exploited in this work , variable coupling is also possible with the tapered fiber providing a way to optimize the combined cooperativity parameter that includes both @xmath3 and the waveguide - cavity coupling efficiency .",
    "additionally , numerical calculations indicate that for sub - micron gap - diamond hybrid devices , the cavity energy decay rate into the fiber should be able to exceed the uncoupled decay rate allowing for efficient photon collection .",
    "the use of nv ensembles provides two main advantages over single centers for device testing .",
    "first , the collected photoluminescence can be much greater allowing for faster testing .",
    "second , device characterization does not rely on nanometer - scale placement of single emitters .",
    "although the devices used to test this platform did not exhibit a significant purcell enhancement , theoretically we showed that the fiber - coupled average purcell factor is 2 - 3 times greater than that of free - space collection .",
