    "the problem of the internal structure of the scalar mesons with mass below 1 gev is still open@xcite . it is controversial whether they are @xmath13 mesons@xcite , @xmath14 states@xcite , bound states of a @xmath15 pair@xcite or a mixing of these configurations .",
    "+ an important part of the program of the kloe experiment , carried out at the frascati @xmath11-factory da@xmath2ne , has been dedicated to the study of the radiative decays @xmath16 ( @xmath17 pseudoscalar mesons ) .",
    "these decays are dominated by the exchange of a scalar meson @xmath18 in the intermediate state ( @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) , and both their branching ratios and the @xmath21 invariant mass shapes depend on the scalar structure .",
    "+ the @xmath3 decay has been already used by kloe and by other experiments to study the neutral component of the isotriplet @xmath8@xcite .",
    "this process is well suited to study the @xmath0 dynamics , since it is dominated by the scalar production , with small vector background , contrary to @xmath22 and @xmath23 cases , where a large irreducible background interferes with the @xmath24 signal@xcite .",
    "+ in this paper the result of the analysis of the @xmath3 decay , performed on a sample with 20 times larger statistics than the previously published paper@xcite , is presented .",
    "the final states corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been selected .",
    "the @xmath9 invariant mass distributions have been fit to two models of parametrization of the @xmath0 decay , to extract the relevant @xmath8 parameters ( mass and couplings ) .",
    "the frascati @xmath11-factory da@xmath2ne is an @xmath25 collider operating at a center of mass energy @xmath26 1020 mev .",
    "the beams collide at an angle of ( @xmath27 - 0.025 ) rad , thus producing @xmath11 mesons with small momentum ( @xmath28 13 mev ) in the horizontal plane .",
    "the kloe detector@xcite consists of two main subdetectors : a large volume drift chamber ( dc ) and a fine sampling lead - scintillating fibers electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "the whole apparatus is inserted in a 0.52 t axial magnetic field , produced by a superconducting coil .",
    "the dc is 3.3 m long , with inner and outer radii of 25 and 200 cm respectively .",
    "it contains @xmath29 drift cells arranged in 58 stereo layers uniformly distributed in the sensitive volume and it is filled with a gas mixture of 90% helium and 10% isobutane . its spatial resolution is 200 @xmath30 m and the tracks coming from the beam interaction point ( ip ) are reconstructed with @xmath31 .",
    "the position resolution for two track vertices is about 3 mm .",
    "+ the dc is surrounded by the emc , that covers 98% of the solid angle , and is divided into a barrel , made of 24 trapezoidal modules about 4 m long , with the fibres running parallel to the barrel axis , and two endcaps of 32 module each , with fibers aligned vertically . the read - out granularity is @xmath32 @xmath33 , for a total of 2440 cells , read at both ends by photomultipliers .",
    "the coordinate of a particle along the fiber direction is reconstructed from the difference of the arrival time of the signals at the two ends of the cell .",
    "cells close in time and space are grouped together into clusters .",
    "the cluster energy is the sum of the cell energies , while the cluster time and position are energy weighed averages .",
    "the energy and time resolutions for photons are @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "cluster positions are measured with resolutions of 1.3 cm in the coordinates transverse to the fibers , and @xmath36 in the longitudinal coordinate .",
    "the detection efficiency for photons of @xmath37 mev is greater than 80% and reaches almost 100% at @xmath38 mev .",
    "+ the kloe trigger is based on the detection of two energy deposits in the emc , with @xmath39 mev in the barrel and @xmath40 mev in the endcaps .",
    "the results are based on the data collected during the 2001 - 02 run , at @xmath41 .",
    "of the two selected decay chains , the fully neutral one is characterized by high statistics and large background , while the charged one has small background but lower statistics .",
    "these two decay chains have been selected with different criteria and slightly different data samples have been used : 414 pb@xmath42 for the fully neutral and 383 pb@xmath42 for the charged decay .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) samples of signal and of background processes have been produced with the simulation program of the experiment@xcite .",
    "they have been generated on a run - by - run basis , simulating the machine operating conditions and background levels as measured in the data .",
    "three mc samples , generated with different luminosity scale factors ( lsf = @xmath43 ) , have been used :    1 .   the _ rad _ sample contains all the radiative @xmath1decays plus the non resonant process @xmath44 , with lsf=5 ; 2 .",
    "the _ kk _ sample contains @xmath45 with all subsequent kaon decays generated with lsf=1 ; 3 .",
    "the _ all _ sample contains all the @xmath11 decays with lsf=1/5 ; it is used to find possible backgrounds not included in the two main samples .",
    "the shape of the @xmath9 invariant mass distribution has been simulated according to the spectrum obtained from the previously published analysis@xcite .",
    "this final state is characterized by five prompt photons originating from the ip .",
    "a prompt photon is defined as an emc cluster not associated to any charged track in the dc and satisfying the condition @xmath46 $ ] , where @xmath47 is the photon flight time , @xmath48 is the corresponding path length , and @xmath49 is the speed of light",
    ". events with exactly five prompt clusters , with e @xmath50 3 mev and polar angle @xmath51 with respect to the beam line , are selected .",
    "+ the main background originates from the other five photon final states , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and from the seven photon process , @xmath54 with @xmath55 , which can mimic five photon events due to either photon loss or cluster merging .",
    "also the three photon final states , @xmath56 with @xmath57 , give a small contribution to the selected sample , when fake clusters are produced either by accidental coincidence with machine background or by cluster splittings .",
    "other background processes are negligible . + the following analysis steps are then applied to the selected events .    1 .",
    "first kinematic fit which imposes the total 4-momentum conservation and the speed of light for each photon , with 9 degrees of freedom .",
    "events with @xmath58 are rejected .",
    "a cut at 980 mev on the total energy of the three most energetic photons is also applied to reject residual three photon events ( processes 4 and 5 of table [ tab : bckg ] ) .",
    "search for the best photon pairing to @xmath59 s and @xmath60 s , by choosing the combination that minimizes the @xmath61-like variable ( @xmath62 are the photon indices ) : @xmath63 for both @xmath64 ( signal ) or @xmath65 ( background ) hypotheses .",

    "background from process 1 and 3 of table [ tab : bckg ] dominates the tail of the distribution of the @xmath70 of the second kinematic fit , as shown in fig.[fig : chi2fit2 ] , and it can be reduced by cutting at @xmath71 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : unfolding ]    the uncertainties are both from statistics ( data and mc ) and from systematics .",
    "the main contribution to the systematic error is the difference between the two unfolded distributions .",
    "the correlation of the contents of nearest neighbour bins of invariant mass is about 50% , for next - nearest neighbour bins is about 20% , and is negligible for bin distance greater than two .",
    "+ an additional uncertainty of 3% on the absolute scale has to be considered , according to eq.([eq : avebr ] ) . + to check this procedure ,",
    "the unfolded distribution has been fit to the kl model , without requiring any smearing matrix .",
    "the parameters values are in good agreement with those of table [ tab : fitkl ] .",
    "a high statistics study of the process @xmath3 has been performed , by selecting the decay chains corresponding to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "+ @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively have been measured .",

    "+ both models used in the fits , the @xmath1scalar meson coupling through the kaon loop ( kl model ) and the direct coupling ( ns model ) , are able to reproduce the experimental @xmath9 mass distribution .",
    "+ from the fit results that @xmath3 decay is dominated by @xmath0 , since the vector contribution is very small , @xmath74 .",
    "+ the fit allows also the extraction of the @xmath8 mass and its couplings to @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and to the @xmath11 meson .",
    "the mass agrees at one standard deviation level with the pdg value .",
    "the two sets of couplings obtained from the fits agree with each other . using these couplings , a total decay width of the @xmath8 in the range @xmath75 mev",
