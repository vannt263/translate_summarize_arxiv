    "ms  1603.6 + 2600  was first discovered in the course of the extended medium sensitivity survey @xcite . with only 51 detected photons in a 2112 s exposure , this detection was useful only in providing the position and a flux estimate of @xmath1 ergs@xmath2s@xmath3 ( 0.33.5 kev ) . @xcite identified the optical counterpart , subsequently designated uw  coronae  borealis , a v @xmath419.7th mag object .",
    "it was shown to be an eclipsing binary : measurements of 10 eclipse timings over a 3-day period has enabled @xcite to derive a 111.0 min orbital period .",
    "this immediately establishes ms  1603.6 + 2600  as a low - mass , compact binary .",
    "to fit in such a short period binary , the secondary must be a low mass star ; and , to be a significant x - ray source , the primary must be an accreting compact object  a white dwarf , which would make the system a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) , a neutron star , or perhaps a black hole , either of which would make it a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) . given the high galactic latitude of this object ( @xmath5 ) , it has to be at a large distance ( @xmath6 kpc ) to be a normal , bright lmxb . on the other hand , the optical spectrum and the high x - ray to optical flux ratio ( f@xmath7/f@xmath8 @xmath415 ) are unlike those of normal cvs .",
    "further optical observations @xcite have revealed highly variable orbital light curves .",
    "report of a 112.5 min period , obtained by @xcite from fourier analysis , would make it a system with multiple periods , if confirmed .",
    "a _ rosat _",
    "pspc observation performed on 1991 august 26 @xcite did not resolve the nature of ms  1603.6 + 2600 .",
    "@xcite discussed the possibility that ms  1603.6 + 2600  may be an lmxb with an accretion disk corona ( adc ) , in which we only observe a small fraction of x - rays scattered in the adc surrounding the inner disk and the neutron star .",
    "they also considered the possibility that it might be a transient lmxb in quiescence .",
    "these scenarios are motivated , in part , by the desire to keep ms  1603.6 + 2600  within a few kiloparsecs of the galactic plane .",
    "we have obtained an _ asca _",
    "observation of ms  1603.6 + 2600  in an effort to clarify the nature of this object ( see also our preliminary report in @xcite ) .",
    "we describe the observation in  2 , the results in  3 , and discuss the implications in  4 .",
    "ms  1603.6 + 2600  was observed with _ asca _  @xcite from 1997 august 30 at 20:25 ut to 1997 august 31 at 13:52 ut . of the 4 instruments on - board _ asca _ , the 2 gis s were operated in the standard ph mode . for the gis data , we have selected intervals when the satellite was outside the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , the attitude control was stable and within 0.02@xmath0 of the target , and the line - of - sight was @xmath9 above the earth limb .",
    "we have also applied a standard selection expression combining monitor count rates and geomagnetic cut - off rigidity ( cor ) to exclude time intervals of high particle background , obtaining @xmath425 ksec of good on - source data .",
    "we extracted the source spectra and light curves using 6 arcmin radius circular extraction regions , and used @xmath413 arcmin radius regions around the center of the detectors , excluding regions within @xmath47.5 arcmin of the source , as background ( no sources were detected in the background regions both for gis and for sis ) .",
    "the net count rates were @xmath40.06 @xmath10cts@xmath10s@xmath3  in gis-2 and @xmath40.07 @xmath10cts@xmath10s@xmath3  in gis-3 .    for the 2 sis instruments ,",
    "we have applied the same saa , attitude , and elevation constraints , and further excluded data taken within 10@xmath0 of the bright earth limb .",
    "we have selected low background time intervals using cor and pixel monitor count criteria , and also excluded data taken within 32 seconds of day / night and saa transitions , when the on - board dark frame calculations are suspect .",
    "these resulted in @xmath425 ksec of useful sis data .",
    "we used an extraction region of @xmath44.5 arcmin radius for the sis-0 , using the entire chip , excluding regions within @xmath45.5 arcmin of the source , as background , with a net rate of @xmath40.12 @xmath10cts@xmath10s@xmath3 . for sis-1",
    ", we were forced to use a smaller ( @xmath43.5 arcmin ) source region to stay entirely within the active chip , obtaining a net rate of @xmath40.08 @xmath10cts@xmath10s@xmath3 .    for spectral analysis , we combined data from like instruments to form a gis spectrum and an sis spectrum .",
    "the latter is affected by the secular change in sis performance at low energies ; this can be phenomenologically characterized as a spurious excess absorption of order n@xmath11  = @xmath12 @xmath2 . for the light curve analysis",
    ", we combined data from all 4 instruments , both using the entire _ asca _  passband , and in two sub - bands , one below 2 kev ( 0.482.0 for sis and 0.72.0 kev for gis ) and the other above 2 kev ( up to 10 kev ) .",
    "we present a 16-s bin light curve of a striking , flare - like event in figure 1 .",
    "this event , detected at 21:45:50 ut on 1997 august 30 , is seen in all 4 individual source light curves , and in none of the 4 background light curves .",
    "we are therefore confident that this is a real event , presumably due to ms  1603.6 + 2600 .",
    "the rise is rapid , and the decay lasts for about 1 minute before blending into the ( noisy ) persistent emission .",
    "the peak count rate ( @xmath4 2.6 @xmath10cts@xmath10s@xmath3  in 4 detectors ) is 8 times the persistent emission .",
    "we have attempted a more detailed analysis of this event , but this has not been fruitful because there are only @xmath460 net counts from this event . in the remainder of this paper , we will refer to this event as a `` burst . ''",
    "the resemblance with a type i x - ray burst ( i.e. , a thermonuclear runaway on the surface of an accreting neutron star ; see @xcite for a review ) is suggestive , but not conclusive .",
    "next , we removed the burst from our light curves and performed fourier and folding analyses .",
    "we find a strong periodicity at 116@xmath136 min , the large uncertainty being due to the limited duration of the observation and data gaps .",
    "we interpret this signal as reflecting the orbital modulation , and proceed below by folding the data on the orbital ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "note , however , that this ephemeris does not define phase 0.0 accurately .",
    "no other periodicities are apparent in the data in the 20020,000 s range .",
    "we present the folded orbital light curves , in high ( @xmath142 kev ) and low ( @xmath152 kev ) energy bands , as well as the hardness ratio , in figure 2 . a clear orbital minimum , lasting @xmath415% of the orbit and reaching @xmath460% of the flux level outside the minimum , is seen in the low energy light curve .",
    "it is less clear in the high energy curve , which is reflected in the slight increase in the hardness ratio at these phase intervals .",
    "inspection of individual orbital cycles shows that the minimum is always present during the same phase in broad outline , though their details vary .",
    "however , given the statistics , we can not rule out statistical fluctuation as the cause of the cycle - to - cycle variations . outside the minimum , the light curves are flat , with apparently random fluctuations superimposed .",
    "this behavior is rather different from that reported by @xcite in their 1991 _ rosat _  pspc observation . to investigate this further ,",
    "we have retrieved the _ rosat _",
    "data from the heasarc and re - extracted the light curves . at first glance , we merely confirmed the results of @xcite .",
    "however , after dividing the _ rosat _  data into two halves of roughly equal durations ( @xmath412 hrs ) , we find a pattern of orbital minimum for the first half of the _ rosat _  observation ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this minimum is absent during the second half ; instead , the folded light curve shows a flaring - like behavior .      despite the improvement over the _ rosat",
    "pspc spectrum , we have not been able to draw a definite conclusion from the average _ asca _  spectrum of ms  1603.6 + 2600 .",
    "it can be fit with a power law , a bremsstrahlung , or a comptonization model : discrimination among these continuum models proved impossible because high signal - to - noise ratio was not achieved over a sufficiently wide bandpass .",
    "no discrete features are obvious .",
    "regardless of the continuum model , the 0.710 kev flux of ms  1603.6 + 2600  during the _ asca _  observation was @xmath4@xmath16 ergs@xmath2s@xmath3 ( @xmath4@xmath17 [ d/10 kpc]@xmath18 ergss@xmath3 ) . ignoring the difference in spectral shapes ,",
    "the @xmath48 fold increase in count rate at the peak of the burst implies a peak luminosity of @xmath4@xmath19 [ d/10 kpc]@xmath18 ergss@xmath3 ) .",
    "the average _ asca _  flux value indicates a significant long - term variability in ms  1603.6 + 2600 .",
    "the _ einstein _",
    "ipc 0.3 - 3.5 kev flux of 1.14 @xmath20 ergs@xmath2s@xmath3 @xcite is roughly a factor of 4 lower than the _ asca _  value , although both the bandpass and the assumed spectral shape are different .",
    "back prediction of _ einstein _  count rate based on _ asca _  flux and the best - fit bremsstrahlung model also points to a factor of @xmath44 change in flux .",
    "similarly , ms  1603.6 + 2600  appears to have been fainter by a factor of @xmath47 during the _ rosat _  observation , compared to 1997 august .",
    "we also compared the spectrum during the orbital minimum to that of the maximum , by simultaneously fitting the two using the same bremsstrahlung model ( identical kt and normalization ) . for the maximum",
    ", we assumed no absorption , since the interstellar column , of the order of @xmath21 @xmath2 according to the _ rosat _  pspc spectral fit @xcite , is too small to be detectable with _",
    "asca_. for the minimum spectrum , we have added an absorption component .",
    "either a simple absorber of n@xmath11  = @xmath22 @xmath2 ( @xmath23=70.6 for 140 pha bins and 4 degrees of freedom ) or a partial covering absorber of n@xmath11  = @xmath24 @xmath2 and a covering fraction of 37% ( @xmath23=64.8 for 140 pha bins and 5 degrees of freedom ) can be used to fit both spectra .",
    "the latter is shown for the gis data in figure 4 .",
    "we have observed an orbital minimum in the _ asca _  light curve which is broad and partial .",
    "our re - analysis of the _ rosat _  pspc light curve shows that a similar minimum was present during the first half of the 1991 observation , but disappeared during the second half .    in the adc model that we favored in our earlier report @xcite ,",
    "this minimum is caused by a partial eclipse of an extended x - ray source , whose size is a significant fraction of the binary separation .",
    "an adc source is an lmxb seen at a high inclination angle .",
    "the central x - ray emitting region is blocked from our direct view by the accretion disk . a fraction ( 110% )",
    "is scattered into our line of site by the adc above the accretion disk .",
    "although this interpretation has several attractive properties , ms  1603.6 + 2600  does not show the smooth , quasi - sinusoidal modulation which is seen in the prototype adc source , x1822@xmath25372 @xcite .",
    "the orbital light curves of adc sources generally appear to be stable from one cycle to the next , while the _ rosat _  data show ms  1603.6 + 2600  to be otherwise .",
    "in addition , the spectrum of x1822@xmath25372 is softer during the partial eclipse , which is the reverse of what we observe in ms  1603.6 + 2600",
    ". therefore , the behavior of ms  1603.6 + 2600  differs in detail from those of well - established adc sources such as x1822@xmath25372 .",
    "moreover , the ingress into the orbital minimum in ms  1603.6 + 2600  ( figure 2 ) takes place in less than one phase bin ( 1/32th of the orbital cycle ) .",
    "it is difficult to construct a geometry of an extended x - ray source that leads to a broad , partial eclipse yet with such a relatively rapid ingress .",
    "on the other hand , the behavior of ms  1603.6 + 2600  is similar to that of dipping lmxbs such as xb  1916@xmath25053 @xcite . in dippers , we believe that the central x - ray source ( the accretion disk , the neutron star , or both ) is occulted by azimuthal structure of the accretion disk .",
    "the preferential location of the structure in binary frame defines the envelope of phases during which dips occur .",
    "the dip durations and depth change from epoch to epoch , sometimes within a single observation .",
    "spectrally , dips are deeper at low energies , although simple absorption models often do not fit the data , instead requiring a partial covering absorber . in all these respects , the _ asca _  data of ms  1603.6 + 2600  are consistent with the dipper interpretation .",
    "we therefore favor this interpretation over the adc model .    as a dipper ,",
    "ms  1603.6 + 2600  must possess an accretion disk .",
    "this immediately excludes the am her - type magnetic cvs ( in which the magnetic field is so strong as to prevent the formation of a disk ) from consideration .",
    "it is still possible that ms  1603.6 + 2600  is a dipping cv with an accretion disk .",
    "for example , u gem , the prototype dwarf nova , is a dipper @xcite .",
    "however , all the objections raised to date remain valid , most notably that the f@xmath7/f@xmath8 ratio is too high : u gem is @xmath41,000 times brighter than ms  1603.6 + 2600  in the optical while only @xmath44 times brighter in the _ asca _  band .",
    "magnetic cvs of the intermediate polar type , which has partial accretion disk , also show x - ray dips @xcite .",
    "however , their defining characteristic is a strong spin modulation in the x - rays , which we do not see .",
    "thus , if ms  1603.6 + 2600  is a cv , it must be an unusual example .",
    "moreover , a burst - like event like the one we have seen in ms  1603.6 + 2600  has never been reported in any x - ray observations of cvs .",
    "we therefore assume , as a working hypothesis , that ms  1603.6 + 2600  is an lmxb containing a neutron star and the burst is a type i event .",
    "this suggest ms  1603.6 + 2600  is at a great distance , since the typical persistent luminosity of a dipper is a few times @xmath26 ergss@xmath3 and the typical burst peak luminosity is a few times @xmath27 ergss@xmath3 .",
    "given the observed flux values , this would require @xmath6 kpc .",
    "is this a serious weakness of this model ?",
    "is there anything in the galactic halo out to , say , @xmath28 @xmath450 kpc ? to answer these questions , we have conducted a simple search for globular clusters near the direction of ms  1603.6 + 2600 .",
    "the nearest match was found to be palomar 14 @xcite , @xmath411@xmath0 away on the sky at an estimated heliocentric distance of 73.8 kpc .",
    "this suggests possible , though speculative , scenarios as to how ms  1603.6 + 2600  might have formed in the outer halo .",
    "first , it may have formed in palomar 14 itself and escaped . of the @xmath4150 galactic globular clusters , 12 harbor a luminous x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "the same stellar encounters that form these lmxbs eject a significant number of resultant binaries .",
    "one calculation @xcite suggest the fraction of the escaped binaries may be about a third of those that have survived in the globular cluster , thus we expect several `` non - globular - cluster '' lmxbs to have escaped from the parent cluster .",
    "similar escapees from a cluster much closer to the galactic center would have been assimilated into the galactic bulge , and its origin would have become obscured . if ms  1603.6 + 2600  was ejected from palomar 14 at a velocity of 10 kms@xmath3 , it would have taken it @xmath41 gyr to move 10 kpc , which is the minimum distance implied by the current angular separation of 11@xmath0 .",
    "thus it appears possible to have a reasonable combination of space velocity and lifetime of ms  1603.6 + 2600  to explain its current location , for an assumed origin in palomar 14 .",
    "another speculative scenario is related to the possible origin of palomar 14 , and many other outer halo globular clusters , in dwarf elliptical satellites of the milky way @xcite .",
    "several outer halo clusters are associated with the sagittarius dwarf .",
    "similarly , palomar 14 may be associated with an undiscovered extant satellite , or one that has been tidally disrupted . in either case ,",
    "ms  1603.6 + 2600  could be a member of this hypothetical satellite galaxy .",
    "if we assume a physical association between ms  1603.6 + 2600  and palomar 14 , at a distance of @xmath29 kpc , then the average luminosity during _ asca _",
    "observation was @xmath4@xmath30 ergss@xmath3 and the peak burst luminosity was @xmath4@xmath31 ergss@xmath3 , both of which are normal for a bursting , dipping lmxb , although still with an unusually low f@xmath7/f@xmath8 ratio .",
    "evolutionary scenario ia of @xcite , similar to short period cvs , predicts a similar luminosity and bursting behavior , and hence fits our outer halo interpretation .",
    "however , this may be a coincidence if ms  1603.6 + 2600  is indeed formed in palomar 14 , since globular cluster lmxbs form in a distinct manner from field lmxbs .",
    "if our interpretation is correct , ms  1603.6 + 2600  is a close analog of xb  1916@xmath25053 , including the strong variabilities of the dip morphology .",
    "in fact , the second optical period obtained via fourier transform @xcite may be real , indicating that ms  1603.6 + 2600  is a permanent superhumper @xcite , another characteristic of xb  1916@xmath25053 .",
    "if so , it would be possible to estimate the mass ratio of ms  1603.6 + 2600  using the fractional period excess .",
    "we have presented our _ asca _  observation of the unusual high - latitude x - ray binary , ms  1603.6 + 2600 . we have detected a burst and an orbital modulation consistent with a dipping behavior , and presented an outer halo lmxb model as perhaps the least contrived interpretation .",
    "future x - ray observations can test our interpretation .",
    "in particular , the detection of other bursts with better sensitivity is necessary to confirm the type i interpretation spectroscopically .",
    "moreover , if we are lucky enough to catch a radius expansion burst , a reliable distance and other parameters can be derived .",
    "the ingress and egress to the orbital minimum should be investigated further , so that we can can conclusively choose between the dipper and the adc interpretations . at the same time , further optical observations should clear up the issue of possible multiple periodicities .",
    "pending such observations , we tentatively conclude that ms  1603.6 + 2600  may be the most distant galactic x - ray binary known .",
    "moreover , this may be an escaped globular cluster lmxb , something we can not confidently observe near the galactic center , or may be a relic of the hierarchical formation of the milky way halo .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained from the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) , provided by nasa s goddard space flight center .",
