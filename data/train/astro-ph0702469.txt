    "measuring stellar oscillations is a very elegant experiment in physics . a star is a gaseous sphere that oscillates in many different modes when excited .",
    "the oscillation frequencies depend on the sound speed inside the star , which in turn depends on properties such as density , temperature and composition .",
    "the sun oscillates in many modes simultaneously and comparing the mode frequencies with theoretical calculations ( helioseismology ) has led to significant revisions to solar models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "measuring oscillation frequencies in other stars ( asteroseismology ) allows us to probe their interiors in exquisite detail and study phenomena that do not occur in the sun .",
    "we expect asteroseismology to produce major advances in our understanding of stellar structure and evolution , and of the underlying physical processes .    here",
    "we review progress in observing so - called _ solar - like oscillations_. this term refers to oscillations that are thought to be excited by convection ( but note that they can occur in stars whose properties are very different from the sun ) .",
    "there has been tremendous progress in observing oscillations in solar - type stars , lying on or just above the main sequence . in a few short years",
    "we have moved from ambiguous detections to firm measurements .",
    "most of the recent results have come from high - precision doppler measurements using spectrographs such as coralie , harps , ucles and uves ( see fig .  [ fig.muara ] for an example ) .",
    "the best data have been obtained from two - site campaigns , although single - site observations are also being carried out .",
    "meanwhile , photometry from space gives a much better observing window than is usually achieved from the ground but the signal - to - noise is poorer .",
    "the wire and most missions have reported oscillations in several stars , although not without controversy , as discussed below .",
    "observations of solar - like oscillations are accumulating rapidly , and measurement have now been reported for several main - sequence and subgiant stars .",
    "the following list includes the most recent observations and is ordered according to decreasing stellar density ( i.e. , decreasing large frequency separation ) :    * @xmath0  cet ( g8 v ) : this star was observed with harps by t. c. teixeira et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "the data were compromised by noise at 3 and 6mhz caused by a periodic error in the guiding system . nevertheless , they were able to measure the large separation ( 170 ) and extract a number of individual oscillation frequencies . *",
    "70 oph a ( k0 v ) : this is the main component of a spectroscopic visual binary ( the other component is k5  v ) .",
    "it was observed over 6 nights with harps by @xcite , who found @xmath1 but were not able to give unambiguous mode identifications from these single - site data . * and  b ( g2  v and k1  v ) : see sec .",
    "[ sec.acen ] * ( g3 v ) : this star has multiple planets .",
    "oscillations were measured over 8 nights using harps by @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig.muara ] ) and the results were modelled by @xcite .",

    "they reported a surprisingly high level of velocity variability on timescales of a few days .",
    "this was also present as line - profile variations and is therefore presumably due to stellar activity .",
    "the observations showed excess power from p - mode oscillations and the authors determined the large separation ( @xmath3 ) but were not able to extract individual frequencies . *",
    "( f9 v ) : oscillations in this star were detected in a weather - affected two - site campaign with elodie and feros by @xcite .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used coralie with good weather but a single site , and reported 31 individual frequencies .",
    "those results were modelled by @xcite , who also reported tentative evidence for rotational splittings .",

    "( g0 iv ) : see sec .  [ sec.eboo ] *  ( g0 iv ) : this a metal - poor subgiant ( @xmath5 } = -1.4 $ ] ) which was observed from two sites using ucles and coralie .",
    "the large separation of 25 , combined with the position of the star in the h - r diagram , indicated that the star has a low mass ( @xmath6 ) and is at least 9gyr old @xcite .",
    "analysis of the power spectrum produced 13 individual modes , with evidence for avoided crossings and with a mode lifetime of @xmath7  days ( carrier et al .",
    ", submitted to a&a ) .      on the main - sequence",
    ", the most spectacular results have been obtained for the system . the clear detection of p - mode oscillations in by @xcite using the coralie spectrograph represented a key moment in this field .",
    "this was followed by a dual - site campaign on this star with uves and ucles @xcite that yielded more than 40 modes , with angular degrees of @xmath8 to  @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the mode lifetime is about 24 days and there is now evidence of rotational splitting from photometry with the wire satellite analysed by @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.fletcher ] ) and also from ground - based spectroscopy with harps ( m. bazot et al .",
    ", submitted to a&a ) .",
    "four oscillation modes in from the wire power spectrum , with fits that indicate the linewidth and rotational splitting .",
    "figure from @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    meanwhile , oscillations in the b component were detected from single - site observations with coralie by @xcite .",
    "dual - site observations with uves and ucles ( see fig .  [ fig.acenb ] ) allowed measurement of nearly 40 modes and of the mode lifetime @xcite .",
    "power spectrum of from velocity observations .",
    "note the double - humped structure with a central dip .",
    "figure from @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we have previously pointed out @xcite that the power spectrum of procyon appears to show a dip at 1.0mhz that is apparently consistent with the theoretical models of @xcite .",
    "a similar dip for low - mass stars was also suggested by g. houdek ( private comm . ; see also chaplin et al .",
    ", submitted to mnras ) , and the observations of in fig .",
    "[ fig.acenb ] do indeed show such a dip , although not at the frequency indicated by the models .",
    "it seems that the shape of the oscillation envelope is an interesting observable that can be extracted from the power spectrum and compared with theoretical models .",
    "[ [ sec.bhyi ] ]    this star is a bright southern subgiant that is slightly more massive and much more evolved than the sun .",
    "oscillations were detected in in 2001 using ucles @xcite and coralie @xcite .",
    "these single - site observations allowed us to measure the large frequency separation ( 57.5 ) but did not produce unambiguous identification of individual modes .",
    "meanwhile , theoretical models for have been published by @xcite and @xcite , which indicate the occurrence of avoided crossings ( also called mode bumping ) .",
    "avoided crossings are an important complication with subgiants in which mode frequencies are shifted from their usual almost - regular spacing by effects of gravity modes in the stellar core .",
    "this goes a long way toward explaining our earlier difficulty in mode identification .",
    "the shifts arise from a strong abundance gradient in the hydrogen - burning shell , just outside the helium core .",
    "quantifying such effects should provide information about the properties of the convective core , including any mixing beyond the region that is convectively unstable ( so - called core overshoot ) .",
    "this star was the target for a two - site campaign in 2005 , with harps and ucles ( bedding et al , submitted to apj ) .",
    "we confirmed the earlier detection of oscillations and were able to identify nearly 30 modes , including some which show the clear effect of mode bumping ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.bhyi ] ) .     the echelle diagram of oscillations frequencies in , based on dual - site observations with harps and ucles .",
    "the measured frequencies are stacked modulo the large frequency separation , and so form nearly vertical ridges .",
    "the strong deviations from vertical alignment in the @xmath10 modes indicate departures from a regular spacing that are due to avoided crossings .",
    "figure from bedding et al .",
    "( submitted to apj).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we used the large frequency separation of beta hyi to infer the mean stellar density to an accuracy of just 0.6% .",
    "combining this with the angular diameter measured with the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) gives a direct estimate of the stellar mass , to an accuracy of 2.7% ( j. north et al , submitted to mnras ) .",
    "this is probably the most precise mass determination of a solar - type star that is not in a binary system , illustrating the power of combining asteroseismology and interferometry ( for other examples , see @xcite ) .",
    "[ [ sec.eboo ] ]    this star , being the brightest g - type subgiant in the sky , remains a very interesting target .",
    "the claimed detection of oscillations almost decade ago by @xcite , based on fluctuations in balmer - line equivalent - widths , has now been confirmed by further equivalent - width and velocity measurements by the same group @xcite and also by independent velocity measurements with the coralie spectrograph @xcite . with the benefit of hindsight",
    ", we can now say that was the first star for which the large separation and individual frequencies were measured . however , there is still disagreement on some of the individual frequencies , which reflects the subjective way in which genuine oscillation modes must be chosen from noise peaks and corrected for daily aliases .",
    "fortunately , the large separation is @xmath11 , which is half way between integral multiples of the 11.57- daily splitting ( 40/11.57 = 3.5 ) .",
    "even so , daily aliases are problematic , especially because some of the modes in appear to be shifted by avoided crossings .",
    "the first spaced - based observations of , made with the most satellite , have generated considerable controversy .",
    "@xcite showed an amplitude spectrum ( their fig .",
    "1 ) that rises towards low frequencies in a fashion that is typical of noise from instrumental and stellar sources . however , they assessed the significance of individual peaks by their strength relative to a fixed horizontal threshold , which naturally led them to assign high significance to peaks at low frequency .",
    "they did find a few peaks around 600 that agreed with the ground - based data , but they also identified eight of the many peaks at much lower frequency ( 130500 ) , in the region of rising power , as being due to low - overtone p - modes .",
    "those peaks do line up quite well with the regular 40 spacing , but extreme caution is needed before these peaks are accepted as genuine .",
    "this is especially true given that the orbital frequency of the spacecraft ( 164.3 ) is , by bad luck , close to four times the large separation of ( 164.3/40 = 4.1 ) .",
    "models of based on the combination of most and ground - based frequencies have been made by @xcite .",
    "procyon has long been a favourite target for oscillation searches .",
    "there have been at least eight separate velocity studies , mostly single - site , that have reported a hump of excess power around 0.51.5mhz .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and leccia et al .",
    "( submitted to a&a ) for the most recent examples .",
    "however , there is not yet agreement on the oscillation frequencies , although a consensus is emerging that the large separation is about 55 .",
    "this star generated controversy when most data reported by @xcite failed to reveal oscillations that were claimed from ground - based data .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the most non - detection was consistent with the ground - based data . using space - based photometry with the wire satellite , @xcite extracted parameters for the stellar granulation and found evidence for an excess due to p - mode oscillations .",
    "a multi - site campaign on procyon is being organised for january 2007 , which will be the most extensive velocity campaign so far organised on a solar - type oscillator .",
    "there have been detections of oscillations in red giant stars with oscillation periods of 24 hours .",
    "ground - based velocity observations were presented by @xcite , who used coralie and elodie spectrographs to find excess power and a possible large separation for both @xmath12  oph ( g9 iii ) and @xmath13  ser ( k0 iii ) .",
    "the data for @xmath12  oph have now been published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have analysed the line - profile variations and found evidence for non - radial oscillations .",
    "meanwhile , earlier observations of oscillations in @xmath14  hya ( g7 iii ) by @xcite have been further analysed by @xcite , who found evidence that the mode lifetime is only about 2days .",
    "if confirmed , this would significantly limit the the prospects for asteroseismology on red giants .",
    "if we define solar - like oscillations to be those excited and damped by convection then we expect to see such oscillations in all stars on the cool side of the instability strip .",
    "evidence for solar - like oscillations in semiregular variables , based on visual observations by groups such as the aavso , has already been reported .",
    "this was based on the amplitude variability of these stars @xcite and on the lorentzian profiles of the power spectra @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used visual observations from the aavso to show that red supergiants , which have masses of 1030 , also have lorentzian profiles in their power spectra ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.kiss ] ) .",
    "power spectra of red supergiants from visual observations ( thin lines ) with lorentzian fits ( thick lines ) .",
    "figure from @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "in the future , we expect further ground - based observations using doppler techniques .",
    "the new spectrograph sophie at lobservatoire de haute - provence in france should be operating very soon ( http://www.obs-hp.fr/ ) . from space , the wire and most satellites continue to return data and we look forward with excitement to the expected launches of corot ( december 2006 ) and kepler ( 2008 ) .",
    "looking further ahead , the siamois spectrograph is planned for dome c in antarctica ( seismic interferometer aiming to measure oscillations in the interior of stars ; see http://siamois.obspm.fr/ ) .",
    "finally , there are ambitious plans to build song ( stellar oscillations network group ) , which will be a global network of small telescopes equipped with high - resolution spectrographs and dedicated to asteroseismology and planet searches ( see http://astro.phys.au.dk/song ) .        ,",
