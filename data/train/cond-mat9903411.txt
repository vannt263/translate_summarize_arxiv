    "a recent article by watts and strogatz @xcite , showing the relevance of what they called `` small - world '' networks for many realistic situations , has triggered a lot of attention for these kind of networks @xcite : this interest results from their very definition , allowing an exploration between regular and random networks .",
    "random networks have of course been the subject of many studies in various domains , ranging from physics to social sciences .",
    "a very important characteristic common to such lattices and for example social networks is that the length of the shortest chain connecting two vertices ( or members ) grows very slowly , i.e. in general logarithmically , with the size of the network @xcite .",
    "this characteristic has important consequences for many issues , e.g. the speed of disease spreading @xcite etc .",
    "the social psychologist s. milgram @xcite , after realizing that the number of persons necessary to link two randomly chosen , geographically separated persons had a median number of six , has called this concept the `` six degrees of separation '' . in addition , models defined on random networks are , due to their locally tree - like structure , of mean - field type , and can therefore be analytically more tractable than their counterparts defined on regular lattices , but , thanks to the finite connectivity of their vertices , they display however behaviours which are intrinsically not captured by the familiar infinite connectivity models @xcite .    however , it is well known that many realistic networks have a local structure which is very different from random networks with finite connectivity . for example , two neighbours have many common neighbours , a property which does not hold for random networks , and which can be quantified by the introduction of the `` clustering coefficient '' ( see section [ geom ] ) .",
    "such phenomena are not only found in social networks , but also e.g. in the connections of neural networks @xcite or in the chemical bond structure of long macromolecules @xcite : the one - dimensional couplings of neighbouring monomers are complemented by long - ranged interactions between monomers that are close in space although not along the chain .",
    "this interplay has been studied in fact for example in @xcite , but it seems that , in this case , the long - range interactions are not sufficient to really modify the properties of the one - dimensional structure of the chain .",
    ", as for a one - dimensional chain @xcite ]    the construction proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite , that we will recall in section [ def ] , allows to reconcile local properties of a regular network with global properties of a random one , by introducing a certain amount of random long - range connections into an initially regular network .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study in some detail the concepts used in @xcite to characterize the `` small - world '' behaviour , caused by the coexistence of `` short - range '' and `` long - range '' connections .",
    "we will show that this behaviour does not appear at a finite value of the disorder @xmath0 , but that , for any @xmath1 , the networks will display this behaviour as soon as their size is large enough .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ def ]",
    "we describe the procedure used to obtain small - world networks ; in section [ geom ] we study some of their geometrical properties , i.e. the connectivity , the chemical distances and the `` clustering '' coefficient , analytically as well as numerically .",
    "section iv contains the investigation of an ising - model defined on a small - world lattice , where the interplay between the short- and long - range interactions leads to interesting physical effects .",
    "the construction algorithm proposed by watts and strogatz for small - world networks is the following : the initial network is a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath2 sites , with periodic boundary conditions ( i.e. a ring ) , each vertex being connected to its @xmath3 nearest neighbours .",
    "the vertices are then visited one after the other ; each link connecting a vertex to one of its @xmath4 nearest neighbours in the clockwise sense is left in place with probability @xmath5 , and with probability @xmath0 is reconnected to a randomly chosen other vertex .",
    "long range connections are therefore introduced .",
    "note that , even for @xmath6 , the network keeps some memory of the procedure and is not locally equivalent to a random network : each vertex has indeed _ at least _",
    "@xmath4 neighbours .",
    "an important consequence is that we have no isolated vertices , and the graph has usually only one component ( a random graph has usually many components of various sizes ) .",
    "it is possible to obtain `` small - world '' networks in other ways , that yields the same physical consequences , and can be more tractable analytically . for example , the networks studied in @xcite are obtained by _ adding _ long - range connections to the initial ring without diluting its one - dimensional structure ; the mean connectivity then changes with the disorder . in section [ ising ]",
    "we will also study an initial network with multiple links between successive vertices .",
    "for @xmath7 , each vertex has the same connectivity @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , a non - zero value of @xmath0 introduces disorder into the network , in the form of a non - uniform connectivity , while maintaining a fixed average connectivity @xmath8 .",
    "let us denote @xmath9 the probability distribution of the connectivities .",
    "since @xmath4 of the initial @xmath3 connections of each vertex are left untouched by the construction , the connectivity of a vertex @xmath10 can be written @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 can then again be divided in two parts : @xmath14 links have been left in place ( each one with probability @xmath5 ) , the other @xmath15 links have been reconnected _ towards _",
    "@xmath10 , each one with probability @xmath16 .",
    "we readily obtain @xmath17 @xmath18 and find @xmath19 we show in figure ( [ fig : connect ] ) the probability distributions for @xmath20 and various values of @xmath0 : as @xmath0 grows , the distribution becomes broader .",
    "we now turn to a non - local quantity of graphs : the chemical distance between its vertices , i.e. the minimal number of links between two vertices .",
    "we note @xmath21 the chemical distance between vertices @xmath10 and @xmath22 , and @xmath23 the mean chemical distance , averaged over all pairs of vertices and over the disorder induced by the rewiring procedure .",
    "watts and strogatz have shown that the mean distance between vertices @xmath24 decreases very rapidly as soon as @xmath0 is non - zero .",
    "they however show the curve of @xmath24 versus @xmath0 for only one value of @xmath2 and do not study how it depends on @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath7 , we have a linear chain of sites , so that we easily find @xmath25 growing like @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath6 @xmath26 grows like @xmath27 ( inset of figure ( [ fig : distrlength ] ) ) : the graph is then random . besides , the distribution of lengths , being uniform between @xmath28 ( shortest possible distance ) and @xmath29 for the linear chain , becomes more and more peaked around its mean value as @xmath0 grows ( see figure ( [ fig : distrlength ] ) ) .",
    "it is therefore quite natural to ask if the change between these two behaviours occurs by a transition at a certain finite critical value of @xmath0 or if there is a crossover phenomenon at any finite value of @xmath2 , with a transition occurring only at @xmath7 .",
    "this last scenario was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "we first investigate this question by numerical simulations , to study the behaviour of @xmath24 in a systematic way , varying @xmath2 and @xmath0 : we use values of @xmath2 from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and we average over @xmath34 realizations of the disorder for each value of @xmath0 . we have studied three different values of the mean connectivity : @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in figure ( [ fig : lmoy ] ) , we plot @xmath37 for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath24 decreases very fast already for small @xmath0 ( note the logarithmic scale for @xmath0 ) : from this point of view , the network is very soon similar to a random network . in particular , as @xmath2 becomes larger , the drop in the curve occurs for smaller and smaller values of @xmath0 , showing that no finite critical value of @xmath0 can be determined this way : in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath37 goes to @xmath39 for all @xmath40 .",
    "this is a first clear indication of a crossover behaviour ( as opposed to a transition at a non - zero @xmath0 ) that we are now going to examine in more details .",
    "note that the first evidence of a crossover has been given in @xcite by the numerical study of system with sizes up to @xmath41 , and mean connectivities @xmath42 .",
    "a scaling of the form @xmath43 was proposed , where @xmath44 depends only on @xmath4 , with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 with @xmath48 as @xmath0 goes to zero .",
    "however , it can be shown @xcite , with a simple but rigorous argument , that @xmath49 can not in fact be lower than @xmath28 : the mean number of rewired links is @xmath50 ; if @xmath51 , and if we take @xmath52 such that @xmath53 , then the scaling hypothesis implies , for large @xmath2 , @xmath54 ( since @xmath55 for large @xmath2 ) ; @xmath56 however goes to zero for large @xmath2 , so that the rewiring of a vanishing number of links could lead to a change in the scaling of @xmath57 .",
    "this obviously unphysical result shows that the hypothesis @xmath51 is not valid .",
    "in addition , newman and watts @xcite , using a renormalization group analysis , have shown that @xmath58 exactly . here",
    "we will arrive at the same result , using our numerical simulations to test the scaling hypothesis , as well as analytical arguments .    to understand how strong the disorder has to be to induce a crossover , and to show that this crossover can occur , at fixed @xmath0 , for @xmath47 , or equivalently , at fixed @xmath2 , for @xmath59 , only with @xmath60 , we study the case of a finite number of rewired links , @xmath61 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath62 . in order to show that such a value of @xmath0 is not able to alter the scaling of @xmath57 with @xmath2",
    ", we now establish a rigorous lower bound .    for",
    "any given sample , the extremities of the @xmath52 rewired links determine @xmath63 intervals .",
    "the sum of their lengths on the ring is @xmath2 , so that at least one of them has a length of order @xmath2 , which is , even more precisely , larger than @xmath64 .",
    "we call this interval @xmath65 $ ] and we consider the interval @xmath66 , of length @xmath67 , @xmath68 $ ] , which has not been modified by the rewiring procedure .",
    "we now decompose the mean length between two vertices of the sample , @xmath69 into two contributions : the first one comes from the pairs @xmath70 with @xmath71 , the second one includes all pairs @xmath70 where at least one of the vertices is not an element of @xmath72 .",
    "the first contribution can be estimated by formula ( [ eq : l0 ] ) , since it comes from a part of the graph which has not been modified , and at a distance big enough from any modified link : @xmath73 ( the inequality comes from the fact that we do not have periodic boundary conditions for this interval ) .",
    "we now have access to a lower bound of @xmath74 ( which is valid for any sample , and consequently also for the average over samples ) : @xmath75 since @xmath74 is smaller than @xmath76 , this shows that @xmath77 in other words , a _",
    "finite _ number of rewired links _ can not _ change the scaling at large @xmath2 : @xmath74 is of order @xmath2 for any finite @xmath52 .    to complete this argument ,",
    "we have computed numerically @xmath78 , i.e. the value of @xmath0 such that @xmath79 .",
    "figure ( [ fig : phalf ] ) shows quite clearly that , for large @xmath2 , @xmath80 : a finite number of rewired links is able to divide the mean length between vertices by two . implies @xmath81 ; we thus have a clear indication that @xmath58 . ]",
    "let us now go back to the scaling hypothesis of @xcite . if the scaling form of equation ( [ ansatz ] ) is valid , we have to compute @xmath24 at fixed @xmath0 in order to estimate @xmath82 .",
    "for large @xmath2 , it behaves like @xmath83 ( see figure ( [ fig : nstarmeasure ] ) for different values of @xmath0 ) . for small @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath82 becomes bigger and bigger , so that we have to use larger and larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "we show in figure ( [ fig : nstar ] ) that the @xmath82 estimated in this way behaves like @xmath84 for small @xmath0 ( and for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , in accordance with @xmath87 ) , giving @xmath58 .",
    "this is not very surprising if we consider the above discussion showing that a finite number of rewired links will change the coefficient of the scaling of @xmath57 with @xmath2 but not the scaling itself .",
    "moreover , @xmath78 corresponds to the drop in the curves of figure ( [ fig : lmoy ] ) and can therefore be considered as a crossover value .    using the determined values of @xmath88 , we plot in figure ( [ fig : collapse ] ) @xmath89 versus @xmath90 for various values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 .",
    "we observe a nice collapse of the data for each value of @xmath4 .",
    "thanks to the range of values of @xmath2 that we use , we are able to show the collapse over a much wider range of values than @xcite .",
    "we clearly see the linear behaviour @xmath91 , and the crossover to @xmath92 .",
    "note that , as explained in @xcite , we have to use values of @xmath0 lower than @xmath93 ( and of course large enough values of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath94 ) to obtain a clean scaling behaviour : for too large @xmath0 , we are moving out of the scaling regime close to the @xmath7-transition .      to define the `` small - world '' behaviour ,",
    "two ingredients are used by watts and strogatz @xcite .",
    "the first one is the chemical length studied in the previous paragraph , which depends strongly on @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the second one is more local : the `` clustering coefficient '' @xmath95 quantifies its `` cliquishness '' .",
    "@xmath95 is indeed defined as follows : if @xmath96 is the number of neighbours of a vertex @xmath10 , there are a priori @xmath97 possible links between these neighbours . denoting @xmath98 the fraction of these links that are really present in the graph",
    ", @xmath95 is the average of @xmath98 over all vertices . on a linear - log plot",
    ", @xmath99 is close to @xmath28 for a wide range of values of @xmath0 , and its drop occurs around @xmath100 .",
    "this is therefore in contrast with @xmath24 , whose drop occurs for much smaller values of @xmath0 as soon as @xmath2 is large enough .",
    "it is therefore an interesting question whether there is an upper threshold on @xmath0 for the small - world behaviour .",
    "we now show that a simple redefinition of @xmath95 leads to a very simple formula , without altering its physical signification , nor the shape of the curve . for @xmath7 ,",
    "each vertex has @xmath3 neighbours ; it is easy to see that the number of links between these neighbours is @xmath101 . then @xmath102 . for @xmath40 , two neighbours of @xmath10 that were connected at @xmath7",
    "are still neighbours of @xmath10 and linked together with probability @xmath103 , up to terms of order @xmath104 .",
    "the mean number of links between the neighbours of a vertex is then clearly @xmath105 .",
    "the clustering coefficient @xmath95 is defined as the mean of the ratio @xmath106 .",
    "if instead we define @xmath107 as the ratio of the mean number of links between the neighbours of a vertex and the mean number of possible links between the neighbours of a vertex , we obtain @xmath108    we check numerically , with @xmath109 to @xmath110 , and averaging over @xmath111 samples , that the two definitions lead to the same behaviour ( we see in figure ( [ fig : clustering ] ) that the difference between @xmath95 and @xmath107 is very small ) , and that the corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : clust ] ) are indeed of order @xmath112 .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath95 is therefore very simply described by @xmath113 , and the dependence on @xmath2 is very small .    to summarize this section ,",
    "we have shown that the small - world behaviour  as defined by the average chemical distance and the clustering coefficient  is indeed present for any finite value of @xmath114 as soon as the network is large enough .",
    "in this section we want to investigate the consequences of the mixed geometrical structure of small - world networks on an ising model as a prototype of statistical - mechanics models that can be defined on it .",
    "this model can be understood as a continuous interpolation of a pure one - dimensional model for @xmath7 showing no phase transition at finite temperature to a model on a random graph .",
    "so , even in the case @xmath6 , the model is not equivalent to the usual random graph where both endpoints of a link are chosen randomly . ] for @xmath6 having a finite critical temperature @xmath115 as long as @xmath116 , cf .",
    "@xcite . in agreement with the results from section [ geom ] , we find for every finite @xmath1 that the low temperature behaviour of the model is of mean - field character , even if we observe a finite temperature crossover to a dominance of the one - dimensional structure .",
    "this observation confirms the value @xmath117 for the onset of a non - trivial thermodynamical small - world behaviour as already found in the geometrical properties , and it shows again the crucial importance of the mixed geometrical structure , as even global quantities can be dominated by the initial ordered structure for high temperatures .",
    "the system we want to study is given by its hamiltonian @xmath118 with @xmath2 ising spins @xmath119 and periodic boundary conditions , i.e. we identify @xmath120 etc .",
    "in the following .",
    "the independently and identically distributed numbers @xmath121 are drawn from the probability distribution @xmath122 i.e. for @xmath7 we obtain a pure one - dimensional ising model where every site is connected to its @xmath3 nearest neighbours by ferromagnetic bonds of strength 1 , whereas this structure is completely replaced by random long - range bonds for @xmath6 .",
    "the number of bonds in the model is given by @xmath123 , independently of the disorder strength @xmath0 .",
    "here we consider only the case of finite probabilities @xmath124 , i.e. an extensive number of links is rewired and , according to the last section , we are therefore in the small - world regime .    in order to decide whether there exists a ferromagnetic phase transition at finite temperature or not",
    ", we have to calculate the free - energy density at inverse temperature @xmath125 . due to the existence of an extensive number as well of random as of one - dimensional links and",
    "due to the translational invariance of the distribution ( [ disorder ] ) we expect this quantity to be self - averaging , we therefore have to determine @xmath126 the average @xmath127 over the disorder distribution @xmath128 is achieved with the help of the replica trick @xmath129 by introducing at first a positive integer number @xmath130 of replicas of the original system , averaging over the disorder and sending @xmath131 at the end of the calculations . thus the replicated and disorder averaged partition function can be written as @xmath132 where we introduced the replicated ising spins @xmath133 .",
    "this expression can be simplified by defining the @xmath134 order parameters @xcite @xmath135 giving the fraction of @xmath130-tuples in @xmath136 which are equal to @xmath137 , and their conjugates @xmath138 .",
    "these order parameters have to be normalized , @xmath139 . after a change",

    ", the contribution of the second term in @xmath145 can be determined by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath143 with right ( left ) eigenvector @xmath146 , @xmath147 = -\\sum_{{\\bf s } } c({\\bf s } ) \\hat{c}({\\bf s } ) + \\ln\\frac{\\langle\\lambda_l|{\\bf t}|\\lambda_r\\rangle } { \\langle\\lambda_l|\\lambda_r\\rangle}\\ , \\ ] ] but in order to calculate the integrals over the order parameters in ( [ zn2 ] ) we have to use the saddle point method which implies @xmath148 i.e. the explicit form of the transfer matrix itself depends on the eigenvectors , and the linear structure of the eigenvalue equations is destroyed .",
    "the problem simplifies significantly in its high - temperature phase where the correct solution of the saddle point equations @xmath149 can be found without knowing the above - mentioned eigenvectors and is given by the paramagnetic values @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "@xmath152 does not depend on @xmath153 , so it can be taken out of @xmath154 and cancels finally with @xmath155 in ( [ zn2 ] ) . in this phase",
    "all replicated spins @xmath153 have the same density , and thus the average magnetization @xmath156 as well as the overlaps @xmath157 vanish .",
    "even if this solution exists for all temperatures , it is not stable for low temperatures .",

    "one half of the eigenvalues has to be negative , the other half positive in order to insure a stable saddle point . ]",
    "the phase transition therefore appears at the point where the first eigenvalue becomes zero and the system becomes unstable with respect to gaussian fluctuations around the given saddle point .",
    "the problem in calculating these eigenvalues consists in the fact that the transfer matrix @xmath143 is given by a sum over non - commuting matrices .",
    "so it is not clear how to obtain the eigenvectors of @xmath143 even at the paramagnetic saddle point where the problem can be linearized again because we already know @xmath160 and @xmath161 and the form of the transfer matrix is fixed .    at this moment",
    "we therefore restrict to the most interesting case of small @xmath162 and treat the problem by means of a first order perturbation theory in @xmath0 around the pure one - dimensional model . in this case",
    "we are in principle able to calculate all the ( @xmath4-dependent ) eigenvectors , which are simple direct products of @xmath130 eigenvectors of the pure and unreplicated transfer matrix , and hence the perturbation - theoretic corrections to their eigenvalues .",

    "the correlation length diverges for low temperatures as @xmath168 consequently , at fixed but low temperature @xmath167 , we find a crossover from a weakly perturbated one - dimensional behaviour for disorder strengths @xmath169 with @xmath170 to a disorder - dominated and hence mean - field like regime for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood by a simple physical argument .",
    "we consider a cluster of correlated spins in the pure model which has a typical length scale @xmath171 .",
    "thus the number of links in this cluster is also @xmath172 for finite @xmath4 , and the average number of redirected links in this cluster at disorder strength @xmath0 is approximately @xmath164 . for @xmath169",
    "there are on average consequently less than one redirected link per cluster , and the system is not seriously perturbated by the disorder .",
    "the opposite holds for larger @xmath0 .",
    "this shows that an arbitrarily small , but finite fraction @xmath0 of redirected links ( `` short cuts '' in the graph ) leads at sufficiently small temperature @xmath173 , @xmath174 to a change of the behaviour of the model from a one - dimensional to a mean - field one , which nicely underlines the importance of both geometrical structures in the small - world lattice .",
    "in the low - temperature regime @xmath175 the thermodynamic behaviour is dominated by the mean - field type disorder , and we expect a finite temperature transition to a ferromagnetically ordered phase at finite temperature @xmath176 at least for sufficiently large @xmath0 and @xmath177 . due to the above - mentioned technical problems in diagonalizing the transfer matrix we can not calculate this transition analytically , and we compute therefore the full line @xmath176 for @xmath38 and @xmath20 by means of numerical simulations .",
    "we use a cluster algorithm @xcite to compute the equilibrium distribution of the magnetization , for system sizes ranging from @xmath178 to @xmath110 , and use binder cumulants @xcite to determine the critical point ( see the inset of figure ( [ fig : betac_num ] ) for an example ) .",
    "the important result is that we obtain a transition at a non - zero temperature for all the investigated values of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , for small @xmath0 we have , as shown in figure ( [ fig : betac_num ] ) : @xmath179    this transition line is found to be always at smaller temperatures than the crossover temperatures , which illustrates again the mean - field character of the phase transition .",
    "even if the behaviour of the system is dominated by the random part of its hamiltonian , the underlying one - dimensional structure is crucial for the existence of the phase transition and for the explicit value of the transition temperature .",
    "this becomes clear from the fact that only the existence of the short - range links leads to the existence of a macroscopic cluster for @xmath0 below the percolation threshold of the random bonds , and can be supported analytically by investigating a version of the model where all one - dimensional bonds are deleted and only the random bonds for fixed @xmath0 are conserved .",
    "this model shows a ferromagnetic transition only above @xmath180 .",
    "so , even if the phase transition is induced by the presence of long - range interactions , it is based on an interplay between both structures .",
    "in this subsection we present a slightly modified model where the full procedure introduced in section [ isinga ] can be followed analytically , and the phase diagram can be calculated explicitly .",
    "the model has the same hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , but its disorder distribution is given by @xmath181 so the underlying one - dimensional graph is changed : instead of having bonds to the next @xmath3 neighbours it includes @xmath4 bonds to each of the two next nearest neighbours ( which , in the pure case , is equivalent to one bond of strength @xmath4 ) . in the disordered version",
    "every of these bonds is replaced with probability @xmath0 by a random bond , so the random structure of the model remains unchanged compared to the original model .",
    "anyway , this model remains a `` valid '' small - world network as it consists of a mixture of a regular low - dimensional with a random long - ranged lattice .",
    "this can e.g. be confirmed by the fact that our simplified model also shows the scaling behaviour ( [ ansatz ] ) with the same scaling exponent @xmath58 as the latter depends only on the dimensionality of the regular structure , cf .",
    "because of the geometrical similarity of the underlying networks we expect also a qualitatively similar thermodynamic behaviour .",
    "again we average the replicated partition function over the disorder and introduce the order parameters @xmath182 and @xmath138 . by doing this",
