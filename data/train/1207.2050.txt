    "quarkonia , bound states made of a quark ( of type charm or beauty ) and its antiquark , offer us a privileged window over the physics of the strong force , which is at the origin of visible matter and , yet , is the least well - understood aspect of the standard model of elementary interactions .",
    "quarkonia represent the most elementary manifestation of the strong binding force and allow us to study crucial open questions : how are quarks confined inside hadrons ?",
    "how do strong forces generate the properties of particles made of quarks ? can quarks become unbound under extreme conditions ( high temperature and density : the quark - gluon plasma ) , as they existed in the first moments of the universe ? to test and consolidate the current theory of the strong force , quantum chromo - dynamics ( qcd ) , it is crucial to study how quarkonia are produced in elementary ( proton - proton ) collisions and in the much more complex nucleus - nucleus collisions , where the potential that binds the quarks and the gluons should be screened and the medium should reflect the partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "however , our present understanding of this physics topic is rather limited , despite the multitude of experimental data accumulated over more than 30 years.@xcite the j/@xmath0  and @xmath2  direct production cross sections measured ( in the mid 1990 s ) by cdf , in @xmath3 collisions at 1.8  tev,@xcite were seen to be around 50 times larger than the available expectations , based on leading order calculations made in the scope of the colour singlet model ( csm ) .",
    "the non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) framework,@xcite where quarkonia can also be produced as _ coloured _ quark pairs , succeeded in describing the measurements , opening a new chapter in the studies of quarkonium production physics . however , these calculations depend on non - perturbative parameters , the long distance colour octet matrix elements , which have been freely adjusted to the data , thereby decreasing the impact of the resulting agreement between data and calculations .",
    "more recently , calculations of next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd corrections to colour - singlet quarkonium production showed an important increase of the high-@xmath4  rate , significantly decreasing the colour - octet component needed to reproduce the quarkonium production cross sections measured at the tevatron.@xcite given this situation , differential cross sections are clearly insufficient information to ensure further progress in our understanding of quarkonium production .",
    "polarization measurements , determining the average angular momentum states of the produced quarkonia from their decay distributions , can provide the definitive tests of the theory of quarkonium production . no other study addresses more directly the question : how does the observed quark - antiquark bound states acquire their final quantum numbers ?",
    "in fact , the competing mechanisms dominating in the different theoretical approaches lead to very different expected polarizations of the produced quarkonia at high @xmath4 .",
    "nrqcd predicts@xcite almost fully _ transverse _ polarization ( angular momentum component @xmath5 ) for directly produced @xmath2  and j/@xmath0  mesons with respect to their own momentum direction ( the _ helicity frame _ ) , while according to the new nlo calculations of colour - singlet quarkonium production@xcite these states should show a strong _ longitudinal _",
    "( @xmath6 ) polarization component .    having two very different theoretical predictions appears to be an ideal situation in the prospect of discriminating between the two theory frameworks using experimental data .",
    "however , the present experimental knowledge is incomplete and contradictory .",
    "a significant fraction ( around one third@xcite ) of promptly produced j/@xmath0  mesons ( i.e.  excluding contributions from b hadron decays ) comes from @xmath7  and @xmath2  feed - down decays .",
    "this sizeable source of indirectly produced j/@xmath0  mesons is not subtracted from the current measurements , and its kinematic dependence is not precisely known . despite this limitation",
    ", it seems safe to say that the pattern measured by cdf@xcite of a slightly longitudinal polarization of the inclusive prompt j/@xmath0  is incompatible with any of the two theory approaches mentioned above .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the intriguing lack of continuity between fixed - target and collider results , which can only be interpreted in the framework of some specific ( and speculative ) assumptions still to be tested.@xcite    the @xmath8  system should satisfy the non - relativistic approximation much better than the @xmath9  case .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath1  data are expected to represent the most decisive test of nrqcd .",
    "however , the present data from tevatron,@xcite for @xmath10  gev@xmath11 , tend to contradict the crucial nrqcd hypothesis that high-@xmath4  quarkonia , produced by the fragmentation of an outgoing ( almost on - shell ) gluon , are fully transversely polarized along their own direction . at lower energy and @xmath4 , the e866 experiment@xcite has shown yet a different polarization pattern : the @xmath12  and @xmath13  states have _ maximal _ transverse polarization , with no significant dependence on transverse or longitudinal momentum , _ with respect to the direction of motion of the colliding hadrons _ ( collins  soper frame@xcite ) .",
    "unexpectedly , the @xmath14 , whose spin and angular momentum properties are identical to the ones of the heavier @xmath1  states , is , instead , found to be only weakly polarized .",
    "these results give interesting physical indications .",
    "first , the maximal polarization of @xmath12  and @xmath13  along the direction of the interacting particles places strong constraints on the topology and spin properties of the underlying elementary production process .",
    "second , the small @xmath14  polarization suggests that the bottomonium family may have a peculiar feed - down hierarchy , with a very significant fraction of the lower mass state being produced indirectly ; at the same time , the polarization of the @xmath1 s coming from @xmath15  decays should be substantially different from the polarization of the directly produced ones .",
    "this rather confusing situation demands a significant improvement in the accuracy and detail of the polarization measurements , ideally distinguishing between the properties of directly and indirectly produced states .",
    "we remind that the lack of a consistent description of the polarization properties represents today s biggest uncertainty in the simulation of the lhc quarkonium production measurements and represents the largest contribution to the systematic error affecting the measurements of quarkonium production cross sections and kinematic distributions .",
    "it is true that measurements of the quarkonium decay angular distributions are challenging , multi - dimensional kinematic problems , requiring large event samples and a very high level of accuracy in the subtraction of spurious kinematic correlations induced by the detector acceptance .",
    "the complexity of the experimental problems which have to be faced in the polarization measurements is testified , for example , by the disagreement between the cdf j/@xmath0  results obtained in run  i@xcite and run  ii@xcite and by the contradictory @xmath14  results obtained by cdf@xcite and d0@xcite .",
    "however , it is also true , as we shall emphasize hereafter , that most experiments have presented in the published reports only a fraction of the physical information derivable from the data .",
    "this happens , for example , when the measurement is performed in only one polarization frame and is limited to the polar projection of the decay angular distribution . as we have already argued in ref .",
    ", these incomplete measurements do not allow definite physical conclusions .",
    "at best , they confine such conclusions to a genuinely model - dependent framework .",
    "moreover , such a fragmentary description of the observed physical process obviously reduces the chances of detecting possible biases induced by not fully controlled systematic effects .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on aspects that need to be taken in consideration in the analysis of the data , so as to maximize the physical significance of the measurement and provide all elements for its unambiguous interpretation within any theoretical framework ( sects .  [",
    "sec : def][sec : feeddown ] ) .",
    "we also discuss ( sect .",
    "[ sec : seqsuppr ] ) how the polarization of vector quarkonia , measured from dilepton event samples , can be used as an instrument to study the suppression of @xmath7 and @xmath15 in heavy - ion collisions , where a direct determination of signal yields involving the identification of low - energy photons is essentially impossible .",
    "because of angular momentum conservation and basic symmetries of the electromagnetic and strong interactions , a particle produced in a certain superposition of elementary mechanisms may be observed preferentially in a state belonging to a definite subset of the possible eigenstates of the angular momentum component @xmath16 along a characteristic quantization axis .",
    "when this happens , the particle is said to be polarized . in the dilepton decay of quarkonium ,",
    "the geometrical shape of the angular distribution of the two decay products ( emitted back - to - back in the quarkonium rest frame ) reflects the average polarization of the quarkonium state .",
    "a spherically symmetric distribution would mean that the quarkonium would be , on average , unpolarized .",
    "anisotropic distributions signal polarized production .",
    "the measurement of the distribution requires the choice of a coordinate system , with respect to which the momentum of one of the two decay products is expressed in spherical coordinates . in inclusive quarkonium measurements ,",
    "the axes of the coordinate system are fixed with respect to the physical reference provided by the directions of the two colliding beams as seen from the quarkonium rest frame .",
    "the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath17 and @xmath18 describe the direction of one of the two decay products ( e.g.  the positive lepton ) with respect to the chosen polar axis and to the plane containing the momenta of the colliding beams ( `` production plane '' ) .",
    "the actual definition of the decay reference frame with respect to the beam directions is not unique .",
    "measurements of the quarkonium decay distributions used mainly two different conventions for the orientation of the polar axis : the flight direction of the quarkonium itself in the centre - of - mass of the colliding beams ( centre - of - mass helicity frame , hx ) and the bisector of the angle between one beam and the opposite of the other beam ( collins  soper frame , cs ) .",
    "the motivation of the latter definition is that , in hadronic collisions , it coincides with the direction of the relative motion of the colliding partons , when their primordial transverse momenta , @xmath19 , are neglected .",
    "we note that these two frames differ by a rotation of @xmath20 around the @xmath21 axis when the quarkonium is produced at high @xmath4  and negligible longitudinal momentum ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "all definitions become coincident in the limit of zero quarkonium @xmath4 . in this limit , moreover , for symmetry reasons any azimuthal dependence of the decay distribution is physically forbidden .",
    "the most general decay angular distribution for inclusively observed quarkonium states can be written as@xcite @xmath23 where the three parameters @xmath24 ( `` polarization '' ) , @xmath25 and @xmath26 satisfy the relations@xcite @xmath27 which , in particular , imply @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 depend on the polarization frame . to illustrate the importance of the choice of the polarization frame",
    ", we consider specific examples assuming , for simplicity , that the observation axis is perpendicular to the natural axis .",
    "this case is of physical relevance since when the decaying particle is produced with small longitudinal momentum ( @xmath34 , a frequent kinematic configuration in collider experiments ) the cs and hx frames are actually perpendicular to one another . in this situation , a natural `` transverse '' polarization ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , for example , transforms into an observed polarization of opposite sign ( but not fully `` longitudinal '' ) , @xmath37 , with a significant azimuthal anisotropy , @xmath38 . in terms of angular momentum wave functions ,",
    "a state which is fully `` transverse '' with respect to one quantization axis ( @xmath39 ) is a coherent superposition of 50% `` transverse '' and 50% `` longitudinal '' components with respect to an axis rotated by @xmath20 : @xmath40 the decay distribution of such a `` mixed '' state is azimuthally anisotropic .",
    "the same polar anisotropy @xmath41 would be measured in the presence of a mixture of _ at least two different production processes _ resulting in 50% `` transverse '' ( @xmath42 ) and 50% `` longitudinal '' ( @xmath43 ) natural polarization along the chosen axis . in this case , however , no azimuthal anisotropy would be observed . as a second example",
    ", we note that a fully `` longitudinal '' natural polarization ( @xmath44 ) translates , in a frame rotated by @xmath20 with respect to the natural one , into a fully `` transverse '' polarization ( @xmath45 ) , accompanied by a maximal azimuthal anisotropy ( @xmath46 ) . in terms of angular momentum",
    ", the measurement in the rotated frame is performed on a coherent admixture of states , @xmath47 while a _ natural _",
    "`` transverse '' polarization would originate from the statistical superposition of _ uncorrelated _ @xmath48 and @xmath49 states .",
    "the two physically very different cases of a natural transverse polarization observed in the natural frame and a natural longitudinal polarization observed in a rotated frame are experimentally indistinguishable when the azimuthal anisotropy parameter is integrated out .",
    "these examples show that a measurement ( or theoretical calculation ) consisting only in the determination of the polar parameter @xmath50 in one frame contains an ambiguity which prevents fundamental ( model - independent ) interpretations of the results .",
    "the polarization is only fully determined when _ both _ the polar and the azimuthal components of the decay distribution are known , or when the distribution is analyzed in at least two geometrically complementary frames .",
    "due to their frame - dependence , the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath26 can be affected by a strong _ explicit _ kinematic dependence , reflecting the change in direction of the chosen experimental axis ( with respect to the `` natural axis '' ) as a function of the quarkonium momentum .",
    "as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : kindep_lambda ] how a natural transverse j/@xmath0  polarization ( @xmath35 ) in the cs frame ( with @xmath52 and no intrinsic kinematic dependence ) translates into different @xmath4-dependent polarizations measured in the hx frame in different rapidity acceptance windows , representative of the acceptance ranges of several tevatron and lhc experiments .    decay angular distribution seen in the hx frame , for a natural polarization @xmath24@xmath53@xmath54 in the cs frame .",

    "it is natural to wonder how the measurement would look like in the cs frame .",
    "however , the transformation to another frame depends on the azimuthal anisotropy , which was not reported by the experiment . for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdf ] , if the distribution in the hx frame were azimuthally isotropic , the measured polarization would correspond to a practically undetectable polarization in the cs frame ( dashed line ) .",
    "however , if we take into account all physically possible values of the azimuthal anisotropy , as allowed by the relations in eq .",
    "[ eq : triangles ] , we can only derive a broad spectrum of possible cs polarizations , approximately included between @xmath62 and @xmath54 ( shaded band ) .",

    "an analysis ignoring the azimuthal dimension can produce _",
    "wrong _ results .",

    "this shows that when only a one - dimensional projected distribution is measured , the detector acceptance description must , nevertheless , be maintained multi - dimensional .",
    "one - dimensional acceptance corrections or `` template '' fits should be avoided , unless the mc is iteratively re - generated with the correct distribution of the variables that have been integrated out ( which has , therefore , to be measured anyway ) . unfortunately , one - dimensional polarization analyses are widespread , even , paradoxically , in precision tests of the standard model and searches for new physics .",
    "to measure the polar anisotropy of @xmath67 decays or drell  yan production using template distributions ( to account for acceptance and efficiency ) integrated over the azimuthal angle , as done in recent analyses reported by lhc experiments , may strongly bias the measurement towards the distribution used to produce the monte carlo simulation .",

    "the spurious anisotropies induced by detector effects and background do not obey the frame transformation rules characteristic of a physical @xmath72 state .",
    "if not well corrected and subtracted , these effects will distort the shape of the measured decay distribution differently in different polarization frames .",
    "in particular , they will violate the frame - independent relations between the angular parameters .",
    "any two physical polarization axes ( defined in the rest frame of the meson and belonging to the production plane ) may be chosen to perform these `` sanity tests '' .",

    "the significance of the test can be maximized by using the cs axis and the `` perpendicular helicity axis ''  @xcite , which coincides with the helicity axis at zero rapidity and remains orthogonal to the cs axis at nonzero rapidity .",
