    "spectra of highly - ionized tungsten in the 4  nm to 14  nm region , observed in the asdex upgrade tokamak in garching , germany , were recently reported by ptterich _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "this tokamak had part of its first wall coated with tungsten .",
    "in the 12  nm -14  nm region twelve lines of w@xmath0-w@xmath1 were identified . in that measurement ,",
    "the lines were observed with a 2.2 m grazing incidence spectrometer .",
    "ionization stages were identified by observing the evolution of the lines during the tokamak discharge .",
    "the wavelength uncertainty was given as @xmath60.005 nm .",
    "these observations made it possible for the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite to resolve a number of questions that had been raised about line identifications in w spectra from earlier tokamak work @xcite .    in the present work we observed highly ionized w using the electron beam ion trap ( ebit ) operating at the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) .",
    "this work is an extension to longer wavelengths of our recent study @xcite of the x - ray spectra of w. the present spectra were observed in the ( 4 - 20 )  nm region with the grazing incidence spectrometer @xcite . as the ( 4 - 8.5 )  nm spectrum of tungsten was well covered in a recent report from ebit - ii at lawrence livermore national laboratory @xcite , we concentrate primarily on the spectra in the longer wavelength region .",
    "these measurements complement the tokamak work @xcite and the new compilation of spectra for all w ions from w@xmath7 to w@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "[ exp ]    highly ionized iron and tungsten were produced in the nist ebit .",
    "the ebit is a versatile light source , capable of producing nearly any ion charge state of nearly any element .",
    "the ebit s electron beam has a very narrow energy distribution ( @xmath9 60  ev ) @xcite that allows precise control of the charge state distribution in the trap .",
    "a detailed description of the nist ebit and its performance is given by one of us elsewhere @xcite .",

    "the mevva uses eight cathodes , any one of which can be quickly selected without disturbing any other experimental conditions .",

    "together these components maximize the light collection efficiency while maintaining moderately good spectral resolution .",
    "the diffraction grating , which is the type designed by harada and kita @xcite , has a radius of curvature of 5649  mm and a variable groove spacing averaging 1200  lines / mm .",
    "when used at a grazing angle of 3@xmath14 , the reciprocal linear dispersion at 12  nm is about 0.6  nm / mm . the detector is a back - illuminated charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera placed at the grating s focal surface .",
    "the ccd consists of a 1340@xmath15400 array of pixels that are directly exposed to extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) radiation .",
    "the signals are column - summed in hardware to minimize read - out noise .",
    "observations of the full frame exhibit negligible spectral line curvature .",
    "the instrument s resolution as configured for this experiment is about 350 , corresponding to a resolving limit of about 0.03 nm .",
    "light from wavelengths above 25 nm was filtered out by a zirconium foil placed between the ebit and the grazing - incidence focusing mirror .",

    "similar to our work on x - ray emission @xcite , the analysis of the euv spectra was aided by collisional - radiative ( cr ) modeling of the ebit plasma .",
    "the non - maxwellian cr code nomad @xcite was used to calculate the level populations and line intensities for various electron beam energies .",
    "the electron density was fixed in the model at n@xmath33 = 10@xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "test runs showed that the modeling results are not sensitive to the value of n@xmath33 in the range 10@xmath34 @xmath35 to 10@xmath36 @xmath35 .",
    "since the atomic data required for the cr modeling of highly - charged tungsten are not available in the literature , we performed large - scale calculations of all relevant parameters , i.e. , energy levels , radiative transition probabilities ( including forbidden transitions ) , and collisional cross sections , using the relativistic flexible atomic code ( fac ) .",
    "the fac methods and techniques , which are described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , are highly suitable for multiply - charged ions of heavy elements , clearly of great importance for the present work .",
    "although the calculations are carried out in a relativistic jj - coupling scheme , we will also be using ls - coupling notation if this is more appropriate . as the cr modeling of non - maxwellian plasmas , such as that of ebit ,",
    "is based on collisional cross sections rather than thermally - averaged rate coefficients , we created a database of cross sections for electron impact excitation , ionization , and radiative recombination .",
    "the cross sections of inverse processes were determined from the principle of detailed balance .",
    "dielectronic recombination was not important in this experiment because the narrow electron - energy distribution function ( eedf ) of the beam does not overlap with the resonant energies that are of importance for dielectronic capture .",
    "also , three - body recombination can be completely neglected under the present low - density conditions .",
    "a total of about 5000 atomic levels for ionization stages from br - like w@xmath2 to mn - like w@xmath37 were included in our simulations .",
    "the eedf of the electron beam was modeled by a gaussian function with a full width at half - maximum of 60 ev .",
    "the results of the calculations were not sensitive to the beam energy width in the range of 30 ev to 60 ev , a range that covers that typical of an ebit .",
    "the assessment of the accuracy of the atomic data for highly - ionized tungsten is impeded by the lack of reliable experimental information , especially for collisional cross sections .",
    "nonetheless , good agreement between the experimental and simulated x - ray spectra @xcite provides a strong indication that the data generated by fac are sufficiently accurate for our present purpose .",
    "one may generally expect higher precision for x - ray spectra simulations compared to the euv case due to higher importance of correlation effects for euv transitions between excited states .",
    "nevertheless , as will be shown below , the simulated euv spectra are also in good agreement with the measurements , both for line positions and for intensities .",
    "another test of the fac data is provided by the calculated ionization potentials ( last column in table [ table1 ] ) , which are seen to differ from the recommended values of ref .",
    "@xcite by less than 0.2  % .",
    "although several papers calculating energy levels and radiative transition probabilities for [ ga ] and [ ni ] isoelectronic sequences were published recently ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the most comprehensive large - scale calculation of atomic data and spectral line intensities for highly - ionized tungsten remains that by fournier @xcite .",
    "he used the fully relativistic parametric potential code relac @xcite to produce spectroscopic data for ions of tungsten from rb - like w@xmath38 to co - like @xmath39 .",
    "the modeling was performed in the steady - state equilibrium approximation . in order to test the applicability of this approximation , we used nomad s ability to solve time - dependent rate equations .",
    "it was found that at an electron density of n@xmath33 = 10@xmath34 @xmath35 , a steady state for a w plasma is reached within few tenths of a second . as the trap is reloaded typically every 4 s and observed continuously over the course of this time , our use of the steady - state approach is fully justified .",
    "the calculated line intensities were convolved with a gaussian function representing instrumental resolution and then multiplied by the transmission function .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows that below 7  nm the calculated transmission function drops rapidly , and in this region it is known less accurately than for longer wavelengths .",
    "we believe this uncertainty explains the somewhat larger discrepancies between intensities of the experimental and simulated spectra for shorter wavelengths .",
    "the theoretical beam energy , used as a free parameter , was varied until a good fit of calculated and measured spectra was obtained . in all simulations",
    "the fitted theoretical energy was found to be smaller than the nominal beam energy .",
    "for instance , the energy difference for run a increases from several tens of  ev at the lowest beam energies to about 500  ev at e = 3113 ev .",
    "such a difference is likely due to ( i ) space charge effects and ( ii ) charge exchange ( cx ) with neutrals or low - charged ions that are present in the ebit .",
    "the space charge effect is estimated to reduce the energy of the beam electrons by not more than about 150 ev . while cx does not modify the beam energy , it effectively enhances recombination and thus shifts ionization balance toward lower charge states . to test the importance of cx",
    ", we performed a series of nomad runs using a simple approximation for the cx cross sections @xcite and varying both the relative velocity of neutrals and w ions , @xmath40 , and the density of neutrals @xmath41 .",
    "although this modification significantly improved the agreement between experimental and fitted beam energies , the uncertainties in @xmath40 and @xmath41 leave too many free parameters to unambiguously account for the effect of charge exchange .",
    "improved models of ebit trap dynamics are needed to determine these parameters .",
    "hence , we excluded the cx contribution in our simulations .",
    "although cx affects the ionization balance , it is not likely to modify the relative line intensities within individual ion stages .",
    "the cx of neutrals with highly - charged ions results in preferential population of the shell with the principal quantum number @xmath42 @xcite ( @xmath43 is the ion charge ) , which gives @xmath44 for @xmath43 = 40 - 47 .",
    "the ensuing radiative cascades are likely to smear out the population flux such that the _ relative _ populations of the low - excited states , which are responsible for the euv emission , would not be modified . an indirect confirmation of this conclusion follows from our previous work on x - ray spectra @xcite where the relative intensities of the w@xmath4lines originating from the @xmath45 shells were accurately calculated without involving charge exchange effects .    finally , note that the variation of the electron beam energy by a few hundred ev does not noticeably affect the relative distribution of line intensities within a specific ion .",
    "therefore , one could separately calculate spectral emission patterns for each ion and then derive the experimental ionization distribution using ratios of line intensities originating from different ionization stages .",
    "[ results ]    all identified lines in the measured spectra of w ( figs . [ fig : fig1]-[fig : fig3 ] ) represent @xmath46 transitions with principal quantum number @xmath47 . the low electron density of the ebit plasma permits measurement of both allowed and forbidden lines .",
    "strong impurity lines from the highly - ionized ions of oxygen and nitrogen are easily recognized by their almost constant intensity as the beam energy is changed .",
    "for instance , the lines at 15.01 nm , 17.21 nm , and 17.30  nm noted in the 2600a spectrum in fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] , are the well known lines of o v and o vi @xcite .",
    "the nitrogen was deliberately introduced as an ion - cooling agent .",
    "also , the strong lines near 6 nm can be seen in the second and third grating orders .",
    "the high - order lines are indicated by dashed ( second order ) and dotted ( third order ) lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the list of identified lines with measured wavelengths is given in table [ table2 ] .",
    "this table also includes other experimental @xcite and calculated @xcite wavelengths as well as the weighted oscillator strengths @xmath48 .",
    "the agreement between @xmath48 values calculated by relac @xcite and fac is excellent for almost all reported lines .",
    "the only exception is the magnetic - dipole ( m1 ) line @xmath49 @xmath50@xmath51 in the co - like ion , where the discrepancy is about 20  % .",
    "as seen from table [ table1 ] , the lowest beam energies of 2001  ev and 2083  ev are sufficient to produce ions up to ge - like w@xmath23 , with ground state configurations @xmath52 , @xmath53 . these ions have a relatively large number of @xmath47 excited states , which results in appearance of wide transition arrays near 6  nm and 13  nm , rather than well separated spectral lines . from comparison with the calculated spectra it was , nonetheless , possible to identify a new magnetic - dipole line @xmath54 in br - like w@xmath55 .",
    "a dramatic change in the appearance of the spectrum is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] when the beam energy is changed from 2083  ev to 2255  ev . at the higher energy , which is sufficient to reach all ionization stages up to zn - like",
    "w@xmath3 ( yet not to produce a significant amount of this ion ) , individual spectral lines become more visible in the spectrum .",
    "the agreement between experimental and simulated spectra patterns is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . while the nominal beam energy was 2169  ev , the best theoretical fit , based on the relative intensities of lines from different w ions in the 12  nm to 14  nm region ,",
    "was obtained for an energy of 2120  ev . aside from impurity and second - order lines that are marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] by crosses and stars , respectively , almost all measured lines can be matched to calculated ones from a visual comparison of line positions and their relative intensities .",
    "moreover , the derived line identifications are well confirmed by the dependence of line intensities upon the beam energy .        as an example , consider in more detail the identification procedure for the strong lines between 12  nm and 14  nm shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ( see also table [ table2 ] ) .",
    "our collisional - radiative modeling shows that at the fitted energy of 2120  ev the most populated ions of tungsten have the following distribution : [ br ] : [ se ] : [ as ] : [ ge ] = 0.01 : 0.10 : 0.42 : 0.46 , and thus one may expect to observe strong emission in w@xmath21 and w@xmath23 .",
    "the strongest lines are marked by letters a through e in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] . both the positions and relative intensities of the lines",
    "b , c , d , and e very well agree with the calculated ones ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) , and therefore these four lines can be identified as follows : b - electric - quadrupole ( e2 ) @xmath60 transition in ge - like w@xmath23 , c - m1 @xmath61 transition in as - like w@xmath21 , d - m1 @xmath62 transition in w@xmath23 , e - m1 @xmath63 transition in w@xmath21 .",
    "this identification is strengthened by the fact that , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , lines c and e become relatively weaker than lines b and d as the beam energy increases . in ref .",
    "@xcite line d was associated with the ga - like ion .",
    "the assignment of quantum numbers for the w@xmath21 levels is highly problematic due to very strong mixing of the basis states in the ground configuration .",
    "for instance , although the ground level is designated @xmath64 , it actually has only 26  % @xmath65 character @xcite .",
    "the theoretical spectrum in fig . [ fig : fig4 ] shows the presence of two other lines , _ f _ and _ g _ , which correspond to transitions @xmath66 and @xmath67 , in the ge - like ion , is identified as @xmath68 in ref .",
    "although it may appear that the experimental line a should be associated with _",
    "f _ , this line can also be seen at lower energy and therefore is assigned to the transition @xmath69 in se - like w@xmath0 .",
    "in order to find the experimental lines corresponding to _ f _ and _ g _ , one can make use of the following observation . the _ four _ strongest lines from w@xmath23 near 13 nm , which are listed in table [ table2 ] , connect _ four _ levels ( fig . [",

    "[ fig : fig2429 ] ) , and one can see a good correspondence between the simulations and the measured spectrum . at this energy , the lines from the ge- and ga - like ions are the strongest , and their identification poses no difficulty ( see table [ table2 ] ) . since the beam energy exceeds the ionization potential of the ga - like ion , the intercombination @xmath75 line in zn - like w@xmath3 is also visible at 13.288 nm .",

    "the spectra for the beam energies between 2600 ev and 3500 ev are dominated by a strong emission in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 lines from zn- and cu - like ions , respectively .",
    "the large difference between the ionization potentials of the cu- and ni - like ions is responsible for small modifications in ionization balance , and thus small variations in the spectral pattern .",
    "although the energy of the beam is sufficient to produce ni - like w@xmath4 , the corresponding @xmath81 transitions are very weak as the total population of w@xmath4 is still relatively small .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2885 ] compares the experimental spectrum at 2885 ev with the simulated spectrum at 2510 ev . as already mentioned , we believe that this difference of 375 ev is due to cx and space - charge effects that are difficult to accurately account for .",

    "@xmath49 @xmath50 with theoretical wavelength of 18.640  nm .",
    "indeed , the measured spectrum contains a strong line at 18.578@xmath60.002  nm , which is absent at lower energies .",
    "we therefore identify this as the [ co ] m1 transition .",
    "twenty years ago ekberg et al .",
    "@xcite , using observed wavelengths for the @xmath92 and @xmath93 transitions in lower - charged ions of the isoelectronic sequence , predicted a wavelength for the @xmath91 ",
    "@xmath50 transition in w@xmath5 to be 18.541@xmath60.032  nm .",
    "the weaker structure at the red wing of this line is the [ cu ] 6.234  nm line @xcite in the third order .",
    "the @xmath81 lines of the ni - like ion are the most prominent in the 4228 ev spectrum .",
    "the wide transition array between 6.5  nm and 8  nm is mainly due to the @xmath94 and @xmath95 transitions in this ion , although it also includes tens of overlapping lines from the cu - like ( @xmath96 ) and co - like ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) ions .",
    "although a good correspondence between the experimental and calculated spectral features can be seen , identification of individual lines is not possible with our spectral resolution .",
    "the well - resolved lines near the [ cu ] @xmath99 line at 12.7118  nm , listed in table [ table2 ] , are mainly due to the @xmath100 transitions in w@xmath4 . according to our calculations , there are only six strong @xmath100 lines between 12.5 nm and 13.5 nm .",
    "the ( 5/2,1/2)@xmath101  ( 5/2,1/2)@xmath101 transition is completely blended with the [ cu ] 12.7118-nm line , while the ( 3/2,1/2)@xmath102  ( 3/2,1/2)@xmath103 and ( 5/2,1/2)@xmath101  ( 5/2,1/2)@xmath103 lines differ by only 0.003 nm and thus can not be resolved .",
    "the former of these two lines has a factor of three higher intensity than the latter , and therefore it is for this transition that the experimental wavelength is listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the remaining three lines in the table are reliably resolved in the measured spectrum .",
    "the [ zn ] intercombination @xmath104 line at 13.2878 nm is still seen in the spectrum , although this ion is present at only about 0.3 % of the total population .    at longer wavelengths ,",
    "a line at 19.1488  nm was identified as the m1 transition @xmath105 ( 3/2,1/2)@xmath102  @xmath105 ( 5/2,1/2)@xmath103 in w@xmath4 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found that the decay of the upper level @xmath105 ( 5/2,1/2)@xmath103 through this process is crucially important for the accurate modeling of intensities of the @xmath106 forbidden lines at 0.8 nm ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "of course , this transition also substantially affects the population of the lower level @xmath105 ( 3/2,1/2)@xmath102 .",
    "[ concl ]    we presented the measurements of the euv spectra of highly - charged ions of tungsten in the spectral range from 4 nm to 20 nm , emphasizing the study of spectral features above 12 nm . implementing advanced collisional - radiative modeling based on extensive accurate sets of atomic data , we were able to identify almost all observed spectral lines .",
    "some of those are newly reported here .",
    "additional independent studies would be valuable in the case of the anomalous intensity observed for the ga - like line at 12.817 nm , the wavelengths of the poorly resolved ge - like e1 lines near 13 nm , and the likely previous misidentification of a zn - like line at 4.45299 nm @xcite .",
