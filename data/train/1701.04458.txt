    "in this work we formulate the general approach in the framework of the eilenberger formalism eilenberger for various experimental realizations of surface layers in these materials .",
    "we investigate thin @xmath4 and thick @xmath5 clean and diffusive films in proximity with bulk p - wave chiral superconductor .",
    "we show that , in accordance with the results of @xcite , spontaneous currents are not sensitive to surface roughness in the limit of thin surface layer , while in the opposite case @xmath6 these currents are strongly suppressed .",

    "the characteristic decay length of the anomalous functions on these trajectories is @xmath132 , that is much smaller than @xmath133 further deviation from the sn boundary is accompanied by deformations in the @xmath88 , which will eventually lead to recovery of @xmath88 to the bulk one .",

    "this means that in contrast to the clean limit considered previously , there is a probability for nucleation of small isotropic diffuse component in @xmath149 distribution .",

    "it follows that these currents depend on the products of the real and imaginary parts of the anomalous green s functions on the incoming and outgoing trajectories from the border .",
    "these parts strongly depends on the requirements of the symmetry of the green s functions , which , in turn , dictate the form of the boundary conditions on the open surface . for d@xmath157-wave superconductors , @xmath158 holds and the conditions ( [ bc1a ] ) , ( [ bc1b ] ) are reduced to the relation @xmath159 which under the circumstances that lead to suppression of the order parameter down to zero at the free interface simultaneously ensures the vanishing of anomalous functions on that surface @xcite .",
