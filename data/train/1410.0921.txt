    "most searches for supersymmetry with r - parity violation ( rpv ) , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a review , adopt one of the following approaches : either one looks for the effects of the relevant operators at low energies in precision measurements , or one focuses on the decay of the ( effectively ) lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) through rpv operators .",
    "this is the result of the strict bounds on most such couplings , which imply that rpv decay widths are typically subdominant , unless they are the only viable option .",
    "for the same reason , possibly spectacular signatures , such as resonant single superparticle productions , are only viable for a limited number of operators and for a constrained range of couplings . in most cases ,",
    "the lsp , with no other alternative decays available , is the best candidate to look at .",
    "the plethora of rpv operators implies that there is a broad range of potential signals @xcite , which also depend on the nature of the lsp . in the presence of rpv , any sparticle may in principle",
    "be the lsp , since bounds on stable massive charged particles no longer apply .",
    "however , the lightest chargino is not usually considered , because common lore says that the structure of the gaugino mass matrices is such that the lightest neutralino is always lighter than the lightest chargino .    in this paper",
    "we point out that this is not necessarily true . as discussed by kribs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , in the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the chargino could in principle be lighter than the lightest neutralino in a corner of the parameter space .",
    "even when heavier , the small mass difference that is possible and even natural in certain scenarios , implies that the chargino , as the next - to - lightest sparticle ( nlsp ) , can have dominant decays through rpv operators .",
    "models with almost - degenerate electroweak gauginos , where such chargino decays can be expected , arise for example in the context of anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "the current absence of any supersymmetry ( susy ) signal at the lhc , and the question of the naturalness of the remaining parameter space , has led to the consideration of so - called natural susy models . here",
    "only the higgsinos , the stops , the left - handed sbottom , and , to a more limited extent , the gluino , are light enough to be probed at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "higgsino dominance of light neutralinos and charginos also leads to small mass differences , although we have recently shown that , given current direct and indirect constraints , the degeneracy is considerably less severe than for winos  @xcite .    in r - parity conserving ( rpc ) models ,",
    "if the degeneracy is severe enough , such spectra can lead to rather characteristic experimental signals in high - energy collisions , with charginos that live long enough to create displaced vertices , or even pass through the detector before decaying @xcite .",
    "here we instead study the consequences of lifting the rpc . in particular , we are here interested in the trilinear rpv operators in the superpotential : @xmath5 we do not include bilinear rpv operators of the form @xmath6",
    ". these will induce mixing between the charginos and the charged leptons , and allow decays for the lightest chargino of the form @xmath7 .",
    "these decays have already been discussed for amsb scenarios motivated by neutrino masses in @xcite .",
    "direct chargino decays via subsets of rpv operators have been considered in the past , especially in the context of lep physics , see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , a detailed discussion that also takes into account the rich flavour structure of the rpv operators is still lacking . here",
    ", we investigate the consequences of direct rpv chargino decays in the context of lhc searches , and we show that this can lead to dramatic signals , such as resonant three - lepton final states due to @xmath8 operators . in addition , the presence of heavy quarks in @xmath9 and @xmath10 operators results in enhanced detection prospects in this case as well",
    ".    one may object to breaking r - parity , since it ensures the existence of a stable sparticle , realising one of the central motivations for weak - scale supersymmetry : the existence of dark matter .",
    "however , as pointed out in recent years @xcite , the gravitino may be the _ real _ lsp , with a naturally long lifetime , due to its tiny gravitational coupling .",
    "for a wide range of parameters gravitinos are essentially stable on cosmological time - scales and can act as dark matter . despite this , we will refer to the neutralino and chargino as the _ effective _ lsp to avoid a very convoluted language .    in this paper , we present an update on how near - degenerate electroweak gauginos arise in general supersymmetry breaking models described by the mssm , and to what extent they are compatible with the recent discovery of a new boson at the lhc , when interpreted as the light sm - like higgs state of the mssm  @xcite , and other direct and indirect constraints .",
    "we study the possibility of a light chargino with the multinest  2.17 @xcite code for parameter sampling , which enables a detailed analysis of the posterior probability distribution in the supersymmetric parameter space of interest , taking into account the available experimental constraints .",
    "we then study the effect of rpv operators on these models in the context of searches at the lhc .",
    "we should note that the interesting properties of chargino decays that we find within our scenario , also apply to extensions of the theory beyond the mssm . in this respect",
    "direct chargino decays can be a powerful tool to probe the gaugino sector and distinguish between different possibilities .",
    "significant deviations from gaugino unification can arise naturally in well - motivated scenarios , for instance due to the presence of f - terms @xcite ; in such schemes , the specific gaugino hierarchies to be expected are fixed to a large extent by the group theory , and the argument can be reversed : if direct chargino decays via rpv operators are detected at significant rates , we will have crucial information on the structure of the gaugino sector and on the underlying gut symmetries of the theory .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : massdiff ] by discussing the parameters that affect the neutralino  chargino mass difference in the mssm .",
    "we then describe the parameter scan that we have performed in section  [ sec : scan ] . in section",
    "[ sec : current ] we look at the consequences of current bounds on the rpv couplings and competition with the rpc chargino decays . in section  [ sec : vertex ] we disucss the impact of current lhc searches for displaced vertices on our scenario .",
    "finally , we describe the consequences of our results for lhc searches for rpv chargino decays in section  [ sec : lhc ] , before we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the mssm , the free mass parameters in the neutralino mass matrix at tree level are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , @xmath14 also enters as a free parameter . with the exception of @xmath11 ,",
    "the same set of parameters enters in the tree - level chargino mass matrix .",
    "any complex phases for the mass parameters are very constrained , in particular due to limits on the electric dipole moments @xcite . however , there are no _ a priori _ grounds not to give arbitrary signs to these parameters , although by a rotation of basis we can choose @xmath12 to always be positive",
    ".    for small @xmath11 the lightest neutralino will be a bino , which is historically the most popular choice . since @xmath11 does not enter in the chargino mass matrix , in this case there is no degeneracy between chargino and neutralino .",

    "it becomes small for very large @xmath31 , but numerically this does not lower the mass difference below 300 mev , unless ( i ) both masses are greater than @xmath32 , or ( ii ) @xmath33 and either mass is very large . for a negative @xmath11 , however , we may have a negative @xmath19 , but this occurs for very special choices of the parameters , namely : relatively small @xmath34 , combined with large @xmath12 and small @xmath14 , see  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above , we have loop corrections that mainly stem from top ",

    "finally , the sleptons are governed by a common mass scale @xmath45 , and we use a common value @xmath46 for the trilinear couplings . we do not scan over the rpv couplings directly , as the sheer number of couplings makes this unfeasible .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : imp ] we discuss in detail the allowed values of these couplings , and study how they affect the chargino lifetime and branching fractions for the set of posterior samples produced by the scan .    for all mass parameters we use logarithmic priors in order to incorporate a prior belief in naturalness  @xcite , while for @xmath14 a flat prior is used .",

    "as the search for rpv decays of charginos is similar to the corresponding decays of neutralinos , we refer to  @xcite for details on the analysis . here",
    "we will mostly focus on the differences that appear when charginos are involved .",
    "the most obvious difference between neutralinos and charginos , as discussed in the previous section , is that for @xmath8 operators , the chargino has a large branching ratio for @xmath57 via a virtual sneutrino or slepton , raising the possibility to observe a resonance of three charged leptons .",
    "since for @xmath58 @xmath38 invariance requires @xmath59 , there are always at least two different flavours in the final state leptons .",
    "thus , the pure leptonic combinations that are most relevant for collider searches are @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath8 operators have some tau flavour in them , which necessarily smears out any resonance peak .",

    "this is clearly an early discovery opportunity for run ii of the lhc .",
    "because of the very low sm background , in order to observe the chargino peak above the combinatorics of the events with supersymmetric origin , slightly more statistics would be needed .",
    "results for the @xmath83 state are very similar .",
    "more detailed studies could be performed by the lhc experiments , to take into account the missing energy resolution and the lepton reconstruction efficiency , which should be high at the transverse momenta of interest , and to include a full background analysis .",

    "the tri - lepton peak is crucial for identifying the scenario giving rise to a multi - lepton excess .",
    "it would tell us that we have a charged particle that decays to a specific combination of three leptons , thus violating lepton number , as well as the mass of that particle , and potentially the spin of the particle through angular distributions of the decay products . as already mentioned , the distributions of fig .",
    "[ fig : trilep ] may help with these identifications also for those operators that do not give rise to a clear peak .",
    "as in the case of neutralino decays discussed in  @xcite , there are also interesting features in the di - lepton invariant mass distributions .",
    "the advantage with di - lepton distributions is that we can employ same - sign subtraction to practically remove the combinatorial background and hence reveal features otherwise invisible .",
    "the combinatorial background consists of lepton pairs that come from different parts of the event and are hence expected to be uncorrelated . as a result",
    ", the charges of these lepton pairs should be uncorrelated and therefore , taking for example the difference , @xmath84 for the @xmath85 invariant mass , should remove the combinatorial background .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dilep ] , where the resulting di - lepton invariant mass distributions for @xmath69 and @xmath86 ( signal and wz background for 1 fb@xmath72 of integrated luminosity ) are shown , this works as expected . for neutralino decays ,",

    "after same - sign subtraction this will show up as a negative contribution in the distribution , and interfere with the positive contributions from both decaying charginos and neutralinos .",

    "the thin dashed lines give the dominant background and the distributions are normalized to 1 fb@xmath72 of integrated luminosity.,width=566 ]    following  @xcite , the cleanness of the di - lepton distributions can be used to extract a substantial amount of information about the scenario at hand , including the chargino / neutralino mass and the flavours of the couplings , also in the difficult cases where the decays are dominated by taus .",
    "in addition one could hope to establish the ratio of neutralino to chargino decays in the final distribution .    to illustrate this ,",
    "let us look at the @xmath85 and @xmath89 distributions in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dilep ] .",
    "the negative perturbation in the @xmath89 channel shows that we have a decaying chargino , while the absence of a clear cutoff as in the @xmath87 channel indicates that one of the muons comes from a decaying tau .",
    "this means that our coupling must have an @xmath90 component .",
    "the large peak in the @xmath87 channel indicates that the last component of the rpv operator must be @xmath91 , and it also gives us the chargino / neutralino mass .",
    "finally , the positive perturbation in the @xmath85 distribution is caused by neutralino and chargino decays with an @xmath85 pair where one of the electrons comes from a decaying tau and the other from the @xmath92 operator .",
    "we can now compare the height of the perturbation in the @xmath85 distribution to the one of the negative perturbation in the @xmath89 distribution .",
    "since the contribution from chargino decays is the same in both distributions , the difference in height between the positive and negative perturbations , when compared to the ( negative ) height of the @xmath89 distribution , reveals the ratio of neutralino to chargino decays in our event sample . in this case charginos are slightly more common than neutralinos .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : ljj ] ( left ) we show the distribution of the invariant mass of @xmath94 combinations for the rpv_c3 benchmark point with the @xmath95 operator for signal only , with arbitrary normalization .",
    "since light quark flavour , and thus charge , is impossible to determine experimentally from jet physics , chargino resonances decaying through the @xmath93 operators have already received significant attention in searches for leptoquarks and neutralinos with rpv decays .",
    "we will therefore limit our discussion here . in terms of chargino masses",
    "the same cross section limits should apply as for neutralinos .",
    "( left ) , and the same for @xmath96 including same - sign subtraction ( right ) .",
    "signal only , normalized to 1 fb@xmath72 of integrated luminosity.,width=566 ]    one exception that is worth mentioning are operators of the type @xmath97 that cause relatively light neutralinos to always decay to neutrino plus jets , @xmath98 , while heavier neutralinos can decay to @xmath99 .",
    "light charginos will always have the possibility to decay to charged lepton plus jets , @xmath100 , thus improving the detectability significantly with both a lepton and a b - tag , and potential charge identification , for the resonance reconstruction .",
    "this can be further improved by same - sign subtraction for the electron and b - jet pair in order to reduce combinatorial background .",
    "we show the resulting distribution of @xmath101 for the @xmath96 operator in fig .",
    "[ fig : ljj ] ( right ) . here",
    "the chargino contribution has been subtracted , showing up as the downward fluctuation in the distribution at @xmath102 gev .",
    "we also note that models with large @xmath103 and @xmath104 from 500 gev to 1 tev were recently studied @xcite as a possible explanation of the deviations from the standard model seen in the @xmath105 channel in cms data  @xcite , however , this requires sleptons with masses around 2 tev , which are very disfavoured in our search due to the naturalness bias and the constraint on @xmath106 that we have applied .",
    "even so , it is worth pointing out that a degenerate chargino ",
    "neutralino pair is not impossible in this scenario , and that such a chargino can be searched for as a resonance in the @xmath107 channel .      for the @xmath108 operators the situation is similar to the @xmath93 operators .",
    "the chargino decays as @xmath109 . for light",
    "flavours a chargino resonance will look just like a neutralino ( or gluino ) resonance decaying into three quarks , @xmath110 , and will be equally challenging to reconstruct , although some improvement could be had from the sophisticated use of jet clustering algorithms @xcite .",
    "experimental bounds on three - jet resonances do exist @xcite , but these have been interpreted only in terms of gluino production and rpv decay , where the production cross sections are much higher . as we have seen in section  [ sec",
    ": vertex ] , rpv decays of charginos through @xmath108 operators should be heavily suppressed compared to rpc decays in scenarios that feature naturalness , and will thus be even more difficult to discover .",
    "we end by pointing out that for the operators @xmath111 , a neutralino decay requires a top quark in the final state , while the chargino can also decay to three down quarks , of which at least one is a bottom quark . as discussed above in section  [ sec : vertex ] it seems difficult to realise a scenario where the chargino is much lighter than 500 gev and decays dominantly through rpv couplings .",
    "thus , this inherent difference may have only marginal applicability since the decay to top quarks will not be very kinematically suppressed at such high masses .",
    "the final states unique to the chargino are the decays to two b - quarks and one light quark , with the experimental signature @xmath112 , and the decays to two top quarks and a light down quark , @xmath113 , which are possible for the @xmath114 and @xmath115 operators .",
    "following the lack of missing - energy signals at the lhc , there is now additional motivation to depart from the mssm and study in more detail alternative realisations of supersymmetry . a promising scenario in this respect is provided by r - parity violation , where missing energy is substituted by multi - lepton or multi - jet events . while especially the latter can often be hard to distinguish from the sm backgrounds , there are channels where the signals can be spectacular .",
    "further motivation for such schemes is provided by the fact that r - parity violation can be perfectly compatible with supersymmetric dark matter , with a gravitino lsp that is stable on cosmological scales , and rapid decays of the remaining superparticles inside the detector , thus being detectable .    within this framework ,",
    "we previously studied neutralino decays at the lhc , paying particular attention to the rich flavour structure of the theory . here",
    ", we extend these studies to direct rpv chargino decays , which can take place in scenarios with a wino or higgsino effective lsp , where the lightest chargino and neutralino have a small mass difference @xmath19 . in order to investigate the properties of these scenarios ,",
    "we employ a bayesian scan over the mssm parameter space , taking into account the relevant constraints .",
    "we perform our main scan with logarithmic priors , checking that the central conclusions remain unchanged with linear priors .",
    "in addition to concrete experimental signatures related to rpv chargino decays , we also identify distinct differences between a wino and a higgsino lsp .",
    "for instance the first is somewhat preferred in the region of small @xmath19 , while the second has a larger rpc branching ratio to leptons , which , if a long - lived chargino is discovered , can be used to probe the gaugino sector of the theory .      * for @xmath116 operators , spectacular signatures , such as three charged - lepton resonances , with explicit lepton number violation in the final state , can be expected . we have shown that this can be the case for substantial patches of the supersymmetric parameter space , even in the mssm , which is the most conservative scenario . in extensions of the theory , the parameter space where such signatures could arise would be enhanced .",
    "in addition , similarly to neutralino decays , there are interesting features in the di - lepton invariant mass distributions , where employing same - sign subtraction practically removes the combinatorial background , thus revealing features that would otherwise be invisible . * for @xmath9 operators ,",
    "the expected physics is similar to rpv neutralino decays , but with some quite interesting differences . particularly for @xmath117 ,",
    "there is a distinct difference between rpv neutralino and chargino decays , since the first involves neutrinos plus jets or a charged lepton and a top quark , while the latter involves charged leptons plus jets or neutrinos and top quarks",
    ". for charginos therefore , a signal with both a lepton and a b - tag and potential charge identification has enhanced detectability .",
    "* for @xmath10 operators we do not expect significant chargino rpv decays for positive @xmath19 . for small ( below pion mass ) and negative mass differences",
    "charginos below 500 gev seem excluded by searches for long - lived charged particles",
    ". for heavier charginos detection through rpv decays seems very difficult , the use of sophisticated jet clustering methods is in general required .",
    "however , we note that the operators @xmath118 have a particularly interesting behaviour : while neutralino rpv decays will always contain a top quark , the chargino can decay to three jets including at least one b - jet . furthermore , for the operators @xmath119 one can also get @xmath112 and @xmath113 final states , opening the possibility to search for rare multi - top events and events with same sign top pairs .",
    "overall , signals from direct rpv chargino decays complement previous studies , and looking for them is necessary in order to make a complete search for supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "moreover , since these signatures are directly correlated to the flavour and group structure of the theory , which determines the particle mass correlations and level of unification at high scales , it is hoped that any observable signal will help to distinguish between different possible realisations of supersymmetry .",
