    "optical studies of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) have been a subject of very intensive recent investigations .",
    "it has been experimentally and theoretically established that the number of carriers which occupy a photoexcited qd greatly affect its photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum.@xcite in spite of its neutral nature , optical spectroscopy has very recently proved to be a useful means for investigating and preparing charged qd systems.@xcite we report here on continuous wave ( cw ) and pulsed optical pl spectroscopy of single self - assembled qds ( saqds ) embedded within a mixed type quantum well ( qw ) structure.@xcite this specific design , which facilitates charge separation by optical means,@xcite is used here to tune the charge state of the qd under study .",
    "two samples were studied . sample a consists of a layer of low density in(ga)as saqds , embedded within the wider of a two mixed type coupled gaas qws , separated by a thin alas barrier layer.@xcite .",
    "sample b , which is used here as a control sample , consists of a similarly prepared saqds layer embedded within a thick layer of gaas.@xcite    we spatially , spectrally and temporally resolve the pl emission from single saqds in both samples using a variable temperature confocal microscope setup .",
    "the setup is described in detail elsewhere.@xcite    in fig .",
    "1a ( 1b ) we present the pl spectra from sample a(b ) for various cw excitation powers at photon energy of 1.75 ev . in fig .",
    "1c ( 1d ) we present the temporally integrated pl spectra from sample a(b ) for various picosecond pulsed excitation powers by the same photon energy . the repetition rate of our ti : sapphire laser which was used for pulsed excitation is 78mhz .    in fig .",
    "1d ( 1e ) we present for comparison model simulations of the pulsed excitation pl spectra for sample a(b ) as explained below .",
    "in previous works[6 - 8 ] we have established that the evolution of the cw pl emission from an optically excited saqd is due to the recombination of increasingly higher orders of neutral multiexcitons .",
    "characteristically , with the increase in power , satellite spectral lines appear to the lower energy side of the first observed line ( @xmath3 in fig .",
    "1b ) and higher energy spectral group of lines ( @xmath4 ) emerges above the first observed group ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this spectral red shift is explained in terms of the exchange energies between the increasing numbers of electron - hole pairs within the neutral saqd . at yet higher excitation powers ,",
    "all the observed discrete pl lines at their appearance order , undergo a cycle in which their pl intensity first increases , then reaches maximum and saturates , and eventually significantly weakens .",
    "consequently , the various groups of spectral lines ( a and b in fig .",
    "1b ) seem to be `` red shifted '' with the increase in excitation power .",
    "this behavior is best described by a set of coupled rate equations@xcite , which give the probabilities of finding the photoexcited qd occupied by a given number of e - h pairs ( multiexciton order @xmath6 ) . at high excitation power the probability to find the qd with small @xmath6 vanishes and thereby the pl lines observed at low powers disappear .",
    "this is no longer true when pulse excitation is used .",
    "in this situation with the increase in excitation power , after reaching saturation , the intensity of the pl of the various spectral lines remains constant and does not decrease with further increase in the excitation power ( fig .",
    "1c ) . in this case",
    "the radiative recombination process is sequential .",
    "therefore , all the multiexcitons which are smaller than the initially photogenerated number of e - h pairs ( @xmath7 ) contribute to the temporally integrated pl spectrum .",
    "this is true , as long as the pulse repetition rate is slow such that all the photogenerated pairs recombine before the next pulse arrives .    in sample",
    "a , the saqds are initially charged with electrons .",
    "these electrons accumulate in the saqds due to the special design of the sample which facilitates efficient hoping transport from residual n - type impurities . with the increase in the excitation power",
    "the saqds are first photodepleted , since the positively charged traps efficiently capture photogenerated electrons while holes diffuse preferentially to the saqds.@xcite the recombination of an e - h pair in the presence of a decreasing number of electrons within the saqd reveals itself in a series of small lines to the lower energy side of the pl line due to recombination in a neutral saqd ( line @xmath3 in fig 1a ) .",
    "the higher the excitation power is , the less charged the dot is and consequently the pl line is closer to the @xmath3 line .",
    "the intensity ratio between the saturated pl lines from the dot in the presence of charge and that from the neutral saqd is roughly an order of magnitude .",
    "this ratio must be equal to the ratio between the rate by which the photexcited electrons leave the impurities and the saqd intrinsic radiative rate .",
    "in a recent work we showed that the later amounts to 5 ns.@xcite .",
    "it follows that the lifetime associated with the trapped photoexcited electrons is few times longer than the time between sequential pulses .",
    "therefore , under pulsed excitation , pl lines from charged states saturate with increasing the excitation power and lose their intensity as the power is further increased . at the same time the pl from neutral states , saturates and remains constant ( see fig .",
    "this behavior provides an unambiguous experimental tool for the distinction between the two pl processes .",
    "comparison between the pl spectra of sample a and sample b reveals yet another distinctive difference . with increasing the excitation power satellite",
    "pl lines appear to the i higher energy side of the neutral @xmath3 line of sample a. these lines can now be unambiguously identified as resulting from recombination from qds that are * positively * charged .",
    "the fact that pl from negatively ( positively ) charged qd is lower ( higher ) in energy than the pl from neutral qd is reported here , to the best of our knowledge , for the first time . this phenomenon can be straightforwardly explained by solving the confined few carriers problem,@xcite with different confining potentials , for electrons and for holes .",
    "the experimental results that we obtained are best fitted by our model,[6 - 8 ] as demonstrated in fig .",
    "1(e , f ) , when a 25% smaller hole envelope wavefunction is assumed .",
    "intuitively it means that the energy associated with the increase coulombic repulsion due to the additional positive holes is greater than the additional exchange energy and the energy associated with the electrons - hole attraction .",
    "we report on the first observation of photoluminescence from a positively charged single quantum dot .",
    "our experimental observations strongly suggest that in self assembled quantum dots holes are better confined than electrons .    *",
