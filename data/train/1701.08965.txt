    "to distinguish nonclassical effects of light from classical ones and to conceive possible applications has been a central question of quantum optics for several decades .",
    "it is of fundamental interest if the outcome of an optical experiment can be interpreted in the framework of classical statistical electrodynamics , or if a quantum description is necessary .",
    "a possible way to certify nonclassical effects is based on moments , as , e.g. , quadrature squeezing  @xcite or sub - poisson statistics  @xcite , each is based on a single observable quantity .",
    "in contrast , anomalous moments composed of non - commuting observables are hard to access in experiments .",
    "an important example is the correlation of intensity and field strength noise , as it unifies the particle and wave nature of quantum light .",
    "its measurement was originally proposed by a homodyne correlation technique with a weak local oscillator ( lo )  @xcite .",
    "anomalous moments were detected in resonance fluorescence of a single trapped atom  @xcite . in this",
    "setting , balanced homodyne detection ( bhd ) with a weak lo was conditioned on the detection of a resonance fluorescence photon .",
    "conditional homodyne detection was also studied by simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite , which allows to observe large violations of a schwarz inequality ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite . however , this approach only applies to a gaussian or weak source field and it requires three detectors .",
    "higher - order correlations of multiple field modes are accessible by balanced or unbalanced homodyne correlation measurements  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two detection schemes have been theoretically analyzed , which use four - port homodyning with comparable intensities of signal and lo .",
    "one of the techniques , called homodyne intensity correlation measurement , was introduced in  @xcite .",
    "it was realized only recently to certify quadrature squeezing in resonance fluorescence light from a single quantum dot  @xcite .",
    "negative values of the measured intensity noise correlation directly uncover nonclassicality of the signal field .",
    "the other technique in  @xcite was called homodyne cross correlation measurement ( hccm ) : signal and lo are interfered at a single unbalanced beam splitter and the two output fields are recorded with linear detectors . unlike in bhd , a correlation measurement is performed .",
    "the detector currents are multiplied and not subtracted , which yields second - order intensity noise correlations .",
    "an experimental realization of this method has been missing yet .    in this contribution",
    "we report the first experimental implementation of hccm .",
    "our signal field is prepared in a phase - squeezed coherent state , generated via parametric down - conversion . for the intensity regime",
    "we use for signal and lo standard linear photodiodes are suitable . the contributions of different orders of the lo field strength are extracted from the measured correlation function .",
    "our method certifies anomalous quantum correlations of squeezed light even for most of the anti - squeezed phase region .",
    "the basic setup of our measurement technique is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] . the investigated squeezed field was generated in a hemilithic , standing wave , nonlinear cavity , used as optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) .",
    "an 11 mm long 7% magnesium oxide - doped lithium niobate ( 7%mgo : linbo@xmath0 ) crystal served as @xmath1-nonlinear medium with non - critical phase matching .",
    "a strong seed beam was inserted into the opa to produce a coherently displaced squeezed field with a signal power of 284w .",
    "the opa was pumped with 243mw at 532 nm resulting in a gain of 2.3 with -2.7db squeezing and 5.5db anti - squeezing at 1064 nm .",
    "the flip mirrors f1 and f2 allow us to send the signal field and the lo either to the bhd or the hccm device .",
    "for the hccm the lo power is of the magnitude of the signal power .",
    "both fields are combined on an unbalanced beam splitter and the two output beams are recorded with photodetectors ( pds ) . in order to validate our hccm technique , we implemented an additional bhd setup .",
    "the latter is used to characterize the generated state with an established technique .",
    "there is only one difference to a normal bhd device , an nd - filter is placed in the signal beam in front of the 50:50 beam splitter to reduce the intensity of the signal to 32w .",
    "this avoids demolition of the pds , as the lo power can be reduced to 1.03mw .",
    "due to the knowledge of the power reduction in the signal field , we are able to estimate the squeezing of the undamped signal . the visibility in the bhd setup is 97% and the quantum efficiency @xmath2% . in the hccm setup",
    "the visibility is 96% and the quantum efficiencies of the pds are @xmath3% .",
    "in both detection setups we used the technique of continuous variation of the optical phase as presented in  @xcite .",
    "this provides a uniformly distributed phase .",
    "the measurement outcome of the hccm is the correlation of electric current fluctuations ( ac ) of the two detectors .",
    "the ac - time - sequences , @xmath4_\\phi$ ] and @xmath5_\\phi$ ] , measured for a particular lo - phase @xmath6 , are same - time correlated , i.e. , @xmath7 for the intensities present in our experiment , the detectors respond linearly .",
    "therefore , the quantity   is proportional to the intensity noise correlation @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the classical expectation value and @xmath11 is the product of detector parameters such as detector efficiency , gain factor , and other positive scaling factors of the detectors @xmath12 .",
    "the intensity noise correlation can be separated into three contributions with different powers of the lo field strength @xmath13 , @xmath14 defining coefficients @xmath15 by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the zeroth - order ( in @xmath18 term is given by @xmath19 with the signal intensity @xmath20 and the intensity noise @xmath21 . it is independent of both phase and field strength of the lo . the first - order term , @xmath22 with the signal ( electric ) field strength @xmath23 and the corresponding fluctuation @xmath24 , in general is @xmath25-periodic in the phase and linear in the field strength of the lo .",
    "note that this anomalous moment is composed of two observables . a fourier decomposition of the second - order term , @xmath26 which is quadratic in the lo field strength , is in general composed of a @xmath27-periodic and a constant fourier component in the lo phase .",
    "the different dependences of the terms   on the phase and field strength of the lo allow us to separate them from @xmath28 , for details see  @xcite and the discussion below .",
    "additional contributions in   arise from classical fluctuations of the lo , which though very small in our case are evaluated as follows . the dominant effect is a constant offset , obtained from a correlation measurement with blocked signal .",
    "this yields a direct observation of the intensity fluctuation of the lo , including possibly occurring correlated dark noise in the two detectors . to correct for lo and correlated dark noise , this offset",
    "is removed from the correlation @xmath29 measured in the case with unblocked signal .",
    "a strong point of the technique is that even if uncorrelated dark noise in both detectors were stronger than the quantum noise of the signal , it does not contaminate the measurement result .",
    "by contrast , uncorrelated dark noise is relevant in bhd .",
    "note that the expressions   are also correct for a lossy beam splitter , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite can also be extended to an asymmetric beam splitter ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the intensity reflection - transmission ratio of the beam splitter for the lo ( @xmath31 ) and for the signal ( @xmath32 ) can be different .",
    "this yields the more general coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we may assume symmetric transmittance , i.e. @xmath35 .",
    "if the lo is strong compared with the signal , the term @xmath36 is dominant , and the correlation outcome is proportional to the negative squeezing effect .",
    "accordingly , in this scenario the anomalous moment negligibly contributes to the total correlation and it is , therefore , not accessible . even if the lo intensity is comparable to the signal intensity , the anomalous moment is only accessible if the beam splitter is unbalanced  @xcite .",
    "the maximum visibility is reached for a @xmath37 intensity partition , which is approximately used in our experiment .",
    "let us study the separation of the contributions @xmath38 from the total correlation @xmath29 by using a fourier decomposition , @xmath39 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with real parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath42 and @xmath43 contain a phase - independent part , it is necessary to perform in addition a measurement with blocked lo , which yields the resulting correlation outcome @xmath44 .",
    "the contributions @xmath45 are obtained from the latter and the fourier coefficients as @xmath46     ( markers ) as a function of phase .",

    "hence the anomalous quantum correlations under study also exist in the anti - squeezed phase region . for comparison ,",
    "the determinant obtained by separation through the lo field strength dependence is shown for @xmath58 . since the lo intensity is not scanned continuously in our case , the drift of the signal state yields a larger uncertainty than the separation by phase .",

    "note that the positive correlation outcome @xmath44 for blocked lo shows that the necessary classicality condition @xmath81 for the variance of the signal intensity is valid .",
    "it is important that the whole previous analysis is purely classical and does not require any bosonic commutation relations  @xcite .",
    "this essential property has the benefit , that the derived classicality condition based on anomalous correlations applies without assumptions on the validity of quantum physics for the interpretation of the measurement outcome .",
    "by contrast , the squeezing condition @xmath82 for a particular phase @xmath6 , which is applied in balanced homodyne detection , intrinsically utilizes non - vanishing commutators .",
    "hence , such quantumness tests require the postulate of the validity of quantum physics .",

    "that is , a state is nonclassical if it violates a condition @xmath84 , wherein @xmath85 denotes normal - ordering , classical expectation values are replaced by the quantum mechanical ones , and classical field quantities @xmath63 by the corresponding field operators @xmath86 .",

    "in conclusion , we have experimentally realized the homodyne cross correlation measurement to observe up to fourth - order moments of the field fluctuations of a phase - squeezed coherent state . in particular , this allows us to determine the anomalous moment , which is composed of two non - commuting observables , namely intensity and field strength noise , which is observed with high significance .",
    "furthermore , a quantum correlation test based on solely the measured moments shows the existence of anomalous quantum correlations even outside the squeezed phase region . as a central benefit ,",
