    "are used to generate a set of single - age synthetic stellar populations ( age bins with widths between 0.5 and 4 gyr ) using the isochrones .",
    "photometric errors and completeness functions are applied to the synthetic stellar populations using the results of artificial star tests produced with dolphot .",
    "we then produce a single multi - epoch cmd designed to match the observed cmd by drawing varying numbers of these degraded stars from the set of single - age populations .",
    "the relative number of stars taken from the different age bins to match the observed cmd in turn yields the sfh .",
    "the method for choosing how many simulated stars are needed from each age bin to recreate the observed cmd involves minimizing the differences in star counts between the observed and the simulated cmds within pre - defined regions on the diagrams .",
    "this minimization procedure is multidimensional and utilizes an amoeba - style algorithm . in order to increase the efficiency of this procedure and to reduce the likelihood that the resulting sfh represents a local minimum , the initial mix of stars is user - defined . in practice , we find that the final sfh produced from a given set of input parameters converges fairly robustly even when starting from significantly divergent conditions such as a constant , continually increasing , or continuously decreasing star formation rate . furthermore , even a somewhat cursory look at a cmd yields information about the presence of young and old populations , so the job of the algorithm is to refine an initial mix that will usually be quite close to the final solution .",
    "the errors in the sfh are measured in two ways . a first estimate is given by the minimization algorithm itself , and is based on the 99% confidence level of the minimum .",
    "this is a lower limit to the actual errors , because it does not take into account the effect of the many random extractions that are part of the procedure .",
    "the error contribution due to differences between subsets of synthetic stars drawn from a population that includes variations due to stellar evolution , photometric errors , and completeness limits , among others , can be quite large .",
    "this issue becomes particularly important when matching populations of stars that exist in very low numbers on the observed cmd , such as the upper main sequence . to measure these effects",
    ", we also perform a bootstrap procedure that involves repeating the entire procedure 100 times .",
    "the final sfh is the average of the 100 repetitions , and the error is the rms of the star formation rate within each bin .",
    "it is always the case that the bootstrap error is much larger than the minimization error .",
    "the predefined regions used in the minimization algorithm are selected by hand to encompass stars in various evolutionary phases .",
    "figure [ box ] shows the observed cmd in @xmath39 vs @xmath32 with the regions plotted as boxes .",
    "boxes 1 - 4 mark the the main sequence stars and we attempt to include a statistically significant number of stars in each box .",
    "boxes 5 and 6 encapsulate samples of rgb stars .",
    "since the rgb includes stars of a wide range of ages , the large sample of the rgb helps to normalize the overall star formation within the galaxy .",
    "box 7 encloses the region where the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) would be located .",
    "the relatively low number of stars observed in this region serves to constrain the number of intermediate aged stars produced in our simulations .",
    "finally , in box 8 we note the presence of blue - loop stars , which along with the high - luminosity main sequence are tracers of recent star formation .          as an initial guess at the ceh of ugc4879 we simulate its sfh using a constant value of [ fe / h]@xmath40 and",
    "note which age bins show star formation activity . from this first step",
    "we refine the ceh by requiring that eras that show significant star formation rates have a parallel increase in metallicity .",
    "we take the rgb metallicity as measured above to be near the initial value for the galaxy . for an endpoint metallicity at recent times",
    "we find that the location of the blue - loop stars provides a constraint .",
    "the distribution of lower luminosity blue - loop stars between the rgb and main sequence varies as a function of metallicity .",
    "figure [ blueloop ] shows a series of simulated cmds of young ( @xmath34500 myr ) stars where metallicity is fixed in a given panel but varies between panels .",
    "the distribution of these lower luminosity blue - loop stars in ugc4879 ( see figure [ box ] ) appears to fall between those with [ fe / h]@xmath41 and [ fe / h]@xmath42 ( lower panels of figure [ blueloop ] ) , hence we take the metallicity of young stars in ugc4879 to be [ fe / h]@xmath43 .     myr@xmath3 . ]        with constraints on the endpoint metallicities of the ceh , the next area of focus becomes the nature of the increase in metallicity between these ancient and recent values .",
    "the width of the rgb provides some information about this increase .",
    "although the rgb may be populated by stars of many ages , the simulations that best represent the observed cmd tend to have rgbs that are dominated by old stars . if this is the case then the metallicity of ugc4879 must increase relatively rapidly at early times in order to account for the intrinsic width of the rgb .",
    "unfortunately , these data do not allow us to resolve the details of this initial star formation activity , and we note only that our simulations consistently fit the data best when we include a significant amount of star formation in the first 4 gyr following the big bang .",
    "these old stars would make up the dominant population of the rgb , and its intrinsic width is best matched with a range of metallicities of around 0.6 dex in extent .",
    "accounting for each of these constraints , we utilize the ceh in figure [ ceh ] to study the sfh of ugc4879 .",
    "the best fitting sfh using this ceh is shown in figure [ sfh1 ] and the resulting simulated cmd is shown in comparison with the observed cmd in figure [ veri1 ] .",
    "we work iteratively to find a ceh and sfh that are consistent with each other and together produce a simulated cmd that matches the observed .",
    "the best matches consistently involve a ceh with ( age , [ fe / h ] ) at around ( 14 gyr , -1.8 ) , ( 10 gyr , -1.2 ) , and ( 0 gyr , -0.7 ) , unfortunately beyond these three estimates we lack constraints on the ceh .",
    "one possible scenario would be that the metallicity remains flat from 10 until 1 gyr ago , followed by a rapid increase in the last gyr . at the opposite extreme",
    "would be a steadily increasing metallicity between 10 gyr and today .",
    "neither of these cehs produce good matches with the data , but the ceh shown in figure [ ceh ] , which is intermediate between these extremes yields results that fit the data well . beyond this ,",
    "the exact details of the ceh that we assign for ages 1 - 10 gyr are not crucial because our observations are not sensitive to stars of these ages .",
    "while we are interested in the sfh of ugc4879 as a whole , it shows signs of spatial variation in recent star formation .",
    "inspection of the distribution of stars in figure [ color ] shows that bright main sequence stars ( bluish in this psuedo - color image ) are highly localized .",
    "this distribution is shown in figure [ xy ] where the locations of upper main sequence stars ( @xmath44 ) are shown as blue triangles and the locations of upper rgb stars are shown as red dots .",
    "the vast majority of the young stars , as denoted by the blue triangles , are located in a region enclosed by a set of line segments in the plot .",
    "the areas of the regions within and outside these lines are 1603 , and 3424 arcsec@xmath45 respectively , which at a distance of 1.36 mpc correspond to physical areas of @xmath46 , and @xmath47 pc@xmath45 . the left panels in figures [ inner ] & [ outer ]",
    "show the cmds of stars in the inner and outer regions .",
    "blue - loop and upper main sequence stars are nearly lacking from the cmd of the outer region , indicating that recent star formation has been weak or nonexistent here .",
    "in contrast , the cmd of the inner region contains all the populations that are seen in ugc4879 as a whole .",
    "the right panels of these figures display the simulated cmds generated in the process of developing separate sfhs for these regions .",
    "these sfh diagrams for the inner and outer regions are presented in figures [ sfhin ] & [ sfhout ] .",
    "the star formation rates presented in these diagrams , as well as those measured for the entire galaxy ( figure [ sfh1 ] ) are listed in table [ sfrtab ] .     with @xmath48 .",
    "main sequence stars are plotted as blue triangles and rgb stars as red dots .",
    "the circle denotes the aperture limit applied to the data to reduce foreground contamination .",
    "the black lines denote the limits of the ` inner ' and ` outer ' regions of the galaxy for the purposes of comparing areas of active and inactive star formation . ]",
    "the observed cmd of ugc4879 is characterized by two distinct populations , old stars that populate the rgb with a small representation in the agb , and young stars that make up the main sequence , blue loop , as well as contribute to the rgb , red clump and agb .",
    "just how old the older stars are remains somewhat uncertain , because we do not observe the main sequence turnoff , hence can not claim to detect an unequivocally ancient population .",
    "the best matching sfhs consistently show significant star formation in the first 4 gyr after the big bang and then a relative lull for 9 gyr until 1 gyr ago after which star formation is measurable again .",
    "a question is : how significant is the 9 gyr lull in star formation ? as mentioned above , the minimization algorithm used to define the sfh in ugc4879 takes an initial input that is user - defined .",
    "therefore , one way to test the significance of the relative lack of star formation at intermediate ages is to insert a star formation rate at these ages and see how things change .",
    "of course , doing so increases the total number of simulated stars on the cmd , so an insertion of intermediate age stars must be matched by a decrease in the star formation rate at a different age , in this case that decrease would occur in the 10 - 14 gyr bin .",
    "the results from the minimization algorithm are robust under this scenario .",
    "any insertion of stellar populations with ages between 1 and 9 gyr gets adjusted by the algorithm to give a star formation rate at these times that is consistent with zero .",
    "this is because the number of simulated and observed stars in the various boxes on the cmd shown in figure [ box ] is matched more closely when the star formation is shifted away from these ages and into the 10 - 14 gyr bin .",
    "while it is comforting that our routine consistently reaches the same minimum , this is not an entirely satisfactory justification for the lull in star formation .",
    "how exactly does the match improve with the exclusion of intermediate aged stars ?",
    "the key distinction comes from the number of agb stars produced in the simulated cmd .    .",
    "the relative star formation rate is normalized to 329 m@xmath50 myr@xmath3 . ]    .",
    "the relative star formation rate is normalized to 440 m@xmath50 myr@xmath3 . ]    at the depth of our observations there are only two stellar types distinguishable for stars with ages over 1 gyr , those that make up the rgb and the agb .",
    "the relative numbers of these stars are sensitive to age , as the agb stars evolve more quickly than those on the rgb . in figure [ agbrgb ]",
    "we plot the ratio of the number of agb to rgb stars ( requiring rgb stars to be within 2 magnitudes of the trgb to avoid confusion with other populations ) versus age for simulated stars in 2 gyr age bins .",
    "the ratio calculated from the cmd of ugc4879 is shown as a horizontal line , so we require @xmath51 for agb stars and @xmath52 for rgb stars included in the ratio .",
    "in addition we apply color cuts based on visual inspection : for the agb we require @xmath53 and for the rgb we use linear limits , which when written as functions have the form : @xmath54 and @xmath55 . ] for an agb to rgb ratio of @xmath56 . as is expected , the general trend is that the ratio increases with time and depends fairly weakly on metallicity .",
    "the various symbols in figure [ agbrgb ] represent fixed metallicities at [ fe / h]@xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , as well as the value of @xmath57 based on the comparison of ugc4879 with ggcs ( shown as filled diamonds ) . at any given time",
    "the agb / rgb ratio is generally higher for lower metallicities , though in many cases the values are statistically indistinguishable .",
    "we take the measured metallicity of the rgb in ugc4879 to be valid for comparing these populations .",
    "if this is the case , then the sfh measured at ages of 10 - 14 gyr is justified by the match in agb / rgb ratios at these times .",
    "this scenario is of course an over simplification , since for instance we see evidence for a range of metallicities in the intrinsic width of the rgb of ugc4879 .",
    "nonetheless , the clear age evolution of the agb / rgb ratio for fixed metallicities explains why the match to the simulations requires an early epoch of strong star formation followed by a long period of low - to - negligible star formation in ugc4879 .",
    "figure [ agbrgb ] also shows that the agb / rgb ratio for stars older than 10 gyr with a metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath40 is consistent with the value observed in ugc4879 .",
    "this metallicity corresponds to what was measured in the rgb of ugc4879 by comparing these stars with those in ggcs .",
    "we present our sfh results in a combined 10 - 14 gyr bin because these observations and simulations lack the resolution needed to distinguish between multiple short bursts or moderate continuous star formation at these early times .",

    "its gravitational potential well is also apparently deep enough to prevent losses due to galactic winds .",
    "this is not a forgone conclusion , as evidenced by kkr25 ( leda 2801026 ) , which is another fairly isolated galaxy at a distance of @xmath69 mpc ( see figure [ xyz ] ) with a @xmath70-band absolute magnitude of @xmath71 @xcite , but has a cmd that shows no signs of recent star formation .",

    "both kkr25 and tucana are less luminous than ugc4879 , but some of this difference is due to their lack of young massive stars .",
    "neither tucana , kkr25 nor ugc4879 have close neighbors so the differences between their sfhs should be independent of environment . ugc4879 would resemble the other two except , presumably , a higher mass has allowed ugc4879 to retain its gas and continue forming stars .",

    "the abrupt edge to the region of star formation running from eight oclock to two oclock in figure [ color ] is suggestive of a galaxy scale compressive event .",
    "if this is the case then this event would likely be the cause of the recent star formation .",
    "however , if the relatively high metal content estimated in these young stars is accurate then it is doubtful that primordial gas could be the trigger for their formation .",
    "nevertheless , a galaxy as isolated as ugc4879 could accrete gas during its lifetime .",
    "it is possible that much of the gas involved in the current star formation could be native to ugc4879 and enriched and the compression from an external cloud might act as a trigger for the collapse of this gas .",

    "while a lack of galaxy - galaxy interactions frees ugc4879 from some of the manifold factors that can influence sfhs , the galaxy itself contributes ample complexity to the problem .",
