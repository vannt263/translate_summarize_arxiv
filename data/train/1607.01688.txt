    "this paper is concerned with topological properties of the set of harmonic solutions of a class of parametrized coupled periodic differential equations .",
    "namely , we consider a perturbed periodic linear nonhomogeneous differential equation in @xmath1 coupled with a ( tangent ) periodic perturbation of the zero vector field on a smooth differentiable manifold .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath2 be a boundaryless smooth manifold , given @xmath3 , we consider @xmath0-periodic solutions to the following system of equations on @xmath4 @xmath5 where @xmath6 , is a continuous matrix - valued map , @xmath7 is a sufficiently regular vector - valued map , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are continuous with @xmath10 and @xmath11 and , in particular , @xmath9 is a tangent vector field to @xmath12 , in the sense that for every @xmath13 it holds that @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , all of these maps are assumed to be @xmath0-periodic , @xmath3 given , with respect to the @xmath15-variable .    by applying fixed point index and degree - theoretic methods , in our main result ( theorem [ tuno ] below ) we deduce a global continuation principle for the @xmath0-periodic solutions of .",
    "more precisely , assuming a non-@xmath0-resonance condition on @xmath16 we provide a condition based on the degree of the vector field @xmath9 averaged along a solution of the first equation of for @xmath17 , that ensures the existence of a connected set of ( nontrivial i.e.  corresponding to @xmath18 , see definition [ deftrip ] below ) @xmath0-periodic solutions of whose closure is not compact emanating from a specific set @xmath19 of @xmath0-periodic solutions of the unperturbed .",
    "the arrangement of equations in may look unusual at first sight but it is pretty natural in some contexts .",
    "consider , for instance , a moving point in the plane or space whose radial distance from the origin is governed by a possibly perturbed linear equation ( the perturbation itself depending on the position in the plane or space ) , while its `` angular '' position with respect to any given frame of reference is influenced only by a small forcing .",
    "the motion of such a point in the plane could be described by a curve in polar coordinates @xmath20 ( allowing negative @xmath21 in the usual sense ) that is determined by a system of equations as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 , that represent perturbations , are @xmath0-periodic in @xmath15 of the same period as the scalar functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "in fact the form of system is rather flexible . in later sections we will show , throughout some examples ,",
    "how it lends itself to quite distant applications .    to get a rough idea of the kind of result that we seek , consider the following equation in @xmath25 : @xmath26 the numerical diagram in figure [ figuno ] shows a portion of the set of points @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the initial data ( for @xmath29 ) of a @xmath0-periodic solutions of corresponding to @xmath30 .",
    "-periodic solutions of ]    roughly speaking , theorem [ tuno ] yields a connected set @xmath19 of `` nontrivial '' @xmath0-periodic solutions emanating from a subset of initial points as in the figure [ figuno ] .",
    "later on , we will analyze the behavior of this set in more detail ( see definiton [ defst ] and theorem [ tdue ] below ) .    on a different tack , observe that system is a periodic perturbation of a nonautomous differential equation . in general , periodic problems of such equations are rather difficult to study , at least with topological methods .",
    "one reason being that it is not easy to compute the fixed point index of the poincar @xmath0-translation operator associated with a nonautonomous equation .",
    "the present study does this in a particular case .",
    "a different situation , but in the same direction was considered in @xcite where perturbations of separated variables equations are tackled by a change of variable approach . here , the difficulties arising from the fact that the unperturbed part of system is nonautonomous are solved thanks to the simple observation that the first equation in of admits a unique @xmath0-periodic solution when @xmath17 and some assumptions are made on @xmath16 .",
    "the technique used here could probably be generalized to the case when the unperturbed first equation of is nonlinear but admits a finite number of `` nondegenerate '' periodic solutions .",
    "moreover , our methods open the way to the analysis of coupled differential equations of type involving delays in the perturbing term ( see , e.g. , @xcite for some recent contributions about similar issues ) .",
    "these lines of research would take us too far from the core topic of the present paper , but will be investigated in future studies .",
    "finally , we point out that our arguments rely on the notions of degree ( or characteristic ) of a tangent vector field and of fixed point index of a map on a manifold . for an exposition",
    ", we refer to standard texts as , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "in fact , @xmath33 can be regarded as a subset of @xmath43 by identifying it with the image of the closed embedding that associates to any point @xmath44 the constant function @xmath45 . also , it is not difficult to prove that @xmath41 is complete if and only if @xmath33 is closed in @xmath46 .",

    "when the matrix - valued function @xmath16 has the `` non-@xmath0-resonance '' property above ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) something can be said about the @xmath0-periodic solutions of , as shown in the following well - known technical lemma whose standard proof is provided only for the sake of completeness :    [ lem : utility - result ] assume that @xmath81 is invertible .",
