    "with the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) now producing data , it has become even more important to understand the phase diagram of qcd at finite temperature , and to determine properties of the high temperature quark - gluon - plasma phase with confidence , _",
    "i.e. _ with controlled lattice spacing errors .",
    "it is fairly well established that qcd with two flavors of massless quarks has a second order finite temperature , chiral symmetry restoring phase transition .",
    "this transition is washed out as soon as the quarks become massive .",
    "qcd with three flavors of massless quarks has a first order finite temperature , chiral symmetry restoring phase transition , which is stable for small quark masses .",
    "not well known is how large the quark masses can be before the phase transition turns second order and then into a crossover , both for degenerate quarks and especially for the physically relevant case of two light and one heavier strange quark .    in previous studies ,",
    "the second question is particularly badly answered due to the flavor symmetry breaking in kogut - susskind quarks , usually used for this purpose : how can one study the influence of the strange quark when most of the ( non - goldstone ) pions are heavier than the ( goldstone ) kaon ?    adding a few terms to the conventional kogut - susskind action , namely three - link , five - link and seven - link staples and a third - neighbor coupling , removes all tree - level @xmath5 errors @xcite . this `` asqtad '' action shows improved flavor and rotational symmetry @xcite , and , at least in quenched qcd , good scaling properties @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi05_rho_vs_a ] . there , and",
    "in other figures below , we plot results in units of @xmath6 , a scale defined in terms of the static @xmath7 potential by @xmath8 , which leads to @xmath9 fm @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we have also preliminary results from simulations with 2 + 1 dynamical flavors , with the heavier quark kept at the strange quark mass , and the lighter masses at @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the real part of the polyakov line and the light quark condensate from these simulations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polr_pbp_f21 ] .",
    "again we see a crossover behavior , particularly for the polyakov line . for these simulations we do not have the data yet to compute the chiral susceptibility .",
    "we have made first simulations to explore the finite temperature phase diagram with an improved staggered fermion action , the `` asqtad '' action , which reduces flavor symmetry breaking so that all pions are lighter than the kaon already at larger lattice spacing , and which improves rotational symmetry and the dispersion relation , leading to diminished lattice artifacts in energy density and pressure .    for three flavor simulations down to quark mass @xmath12 , and for 2 + 1 flavor simulations with the light quark masses down to @xmath13 while the heavier quark is kept at the strange quark mass",
    ", we observed finite temperature crossover behavior , but so far no sign of a genuine phase transition .",
    "this result is compatible with other recent simulations @xcite which found phase transitions only at quark masses lighter than those studied by us so far .",
    "the temperature at the crossover , with the scale set by @xmath6 , @xmath14  200 mev , is a little higher than expected from previous determinations @xcite .",
    "this is presumably also due to our quark masses still being rather high .",
