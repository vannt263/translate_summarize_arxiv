    "<S> however , most theoretical models of the ccqe cross section ( for recent reviews see ref.@xcite ) fail to support this explanation . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the analysis of the large body of electron scattering data provide overwhelming evidence that the vector form factors are _ not _ modified in the nuclear medium . in refs .  </S>",

    "<S> it clearly appears that the energy bin corresponding to the top of the quasi elastic peak at @xmath21 gev , shown by the shaded area , receives significant contributions from cross sections corresponding to different beam energies and different values of @xmath10 .    the data displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ newdist ] strongly suggest that the description of the flux - integrated ccqe neutrino nucleus cross section requires the inclusion of reaction mechanisms other than single nucleon knockout . </S>",
    "<S> according to the authors of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the most important competing mechanism is multinucleon knockout , leading to two particle - two hole ( 2p2h ) final states . note that in neutrino experiments this final states can not be distinguished from the one particle - one hole final states associated with single nucleon knockout .    </S>",
    "<S> multinucleon knockout is known to occur due to i ) initial state nucleon - nucleon correlations , ii ) final state interactions between the struck nucleon and the spectator particles and iii ) coupling to the two - body nuclear electroweak current .    </S>",
    "<S> correlations between nucleons in the target ground state give rise to the tail extending to large @xmath2 , clearly visible in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ xsec_ee_2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , their contribution , strongly constrained by semi - inclusive @xmath22 data @xcite turns out to be quite small ( less than 10% of the integrated spectrum ) . in principle , this reaction mechanism might be clearly identified detecting two nucleons moving in opposite directions with momenta much larger than the fermi momentum ( @xmath23 250 mev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> final state interactions are not expected to play a relevant relevant in this context , as their main effects , which amounts to a shift and a redistribution of the inclusive strength , mostly affects the region of low energy loss , corresponding to @xmath24 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most important correction is likely to arise from processes involving the nuclear two - body current , as advocated by the authors of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is long known that inclusion of these processes is needed to explain the nuclear electromagnetic response in the transverse channel @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , their contribution turns out to decrease as the momentum transfer increases . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior may explain why the ccqe data at high neutrino energies collected by the nomad collaboration @xcite can be described without any modification of the value of the nucleon axial mass .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , comparison between electron and neutrino scattering data suggest that the analysis of the flux - averaged neutrino cross sections requires the development of models including a variety of relevant reaction mechanisms . while the approaches developed in refs.@xcite certainly represent an important step towards the achievement of this goal , more theoretical work is still needed , e.g. to extend the applicability of the models to the regions of pion production and deep inelastic scattering .    the critical requirement to be met in developing new theoretical approaches will be consistency , i.e. the ability to describe different kinematical regimes using the same dynamical model . within _ ab initio </S>",
    "<S> _ nuclear many - body theory this amounts to requiring that the target initial and final states be obtained from the same hamiltonian , fitted to the properties of exactly solvable few - nucleon systems , which also largely determines the structure of the vector two - body current through the continuity equation .      </S>",
    "<S> the results discussed in this paper have been obtained in collaboration with pietro coletti and davide meloni . an illuminating discussion with georgia karagiorgi and camillo mariani is also gratefully acknowledged . </S>",
    "<S> finally , i would like to express to the organizers of nufact11 my deepest appreciation for setting up a most enjoyable and fruitful meeting . </S>"
