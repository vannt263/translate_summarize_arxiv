    "in planet formation theory , the process through which @xmath0 km or larger bodies are formed is still not well understood , since a straightforward formation mechanism is lacking @xcite . however , once these bodies appear gravity takes over the accretion process , fulfilling both the role as a sticking agent as well as an important accelerator for growth : the gravitational cross section between two bodies can become much larger than their geometrical cross section .",
    "this phenomenon is better known as gravitational focusing and the gravitational enhancement factor in this regime is given by @xmath0@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the ( mutual ) escape velocity and @xmath4 the velocity dispersion of bodies . initially , gravitational focusing factors for the biggest bodies increase rapidly , and the system experiences _ runaway growth _ : @xmath3 increases much faster than @xmath4 .",
    "however , at a certain point the stirring capabilities of the biggest body will cause @xmath4 to increase rapidly .",
    "gravitational focusing factors decrease and the growth becomes self - regulated since the stirring rate of small bodies is determined by the same big body that accretes them .",
    "runaway growth has passed into oligarchy @xcite .",
    "@xcite have argued that the runaway growth - oligarchy transition takes place at the point where the stirring power of big bodies first exceeds that of the small bodies , i.e.,@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the surface density of big bodies of mass @xmath7 and @xmath8 that of the small bodies .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : im93 ] ) can be transformed into a radius , @xmath9 , indicating the turnover from runaway growth into oligarchy ( see below , ) .",
    "many works have adopted equation  ( [ eq : im93 ] ) as the start of their oligarchic calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", we will refine the criterion of @xcite and present a new expression for @xmath9 ( ) . in runaway growth the column density spectrum evolves into a power law , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , for a @xmath12 index , the stirring power lies at the high - mass end of the population ; that is , during runaway growth the stirring power is already moving away from the initial mass ( @xmath13 ) . despite the stirring , the system continues in its runaway ( fast ) growth mode .",
    "the point is that equation  ( [ eq : im93 ] ) implicitly assumes that stirring occurs fast and outpaces the accretion , which is true for oligarchy but not for runaway growth . in other words ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : im93 ] ) is a necessary condition for oligarchy but not a sufficient one .",
    "instead , we will argue that the condition for the start of oligarchy is met when the stirring timescale in the two component approximation ( @xmath14 , see below ) drops below the accretion timescale that characterizes the runaway regime , @xmath15 .    in",
    "we first introduce key definitions and obtain the stirring timescale @xmath14 and the accretion timescale @xmath16 for a two component system . in",
    "we present the results of our runaway growth simulations in terms of @xmath15 , the accretion timescale during runaway growth , which follows from our simulations . then presents the new transition radius @xmath17 by equating the timescale expressions .",
    "we discusses a few implications and summarize in .",
    "the hill radius @xmath18 and hill velocity @xmath19 of a single body of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath20 are given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 the disk radius ( semi major axis ) , @xmath23 the mass of the star , and @xmath24 the orbital frequency at semi major axis @xmath22 .",
    "the escape velocity is defined @xmath25 where @xmath26 is newton s gravitational constant . using these definitions",
    "one can show that @xmath27 , where the dimensionless @xmath28 is given by ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath29 where we used @xmath30 with @xmath31 the internal density of the bodies . when discussing interactions one should use combined masses and radii in the above definitions ( i.e. ,  @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) but this leaves equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) and the relation @xmath27 unaffected .",
    "in the following we assume a two component model where a single big body of mass @xmath7 and radius @xmath20 interacts with smaller bodies of radius @xmath34 and mass @xmath13 that dominate the solids surface density , @xmath35 .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath4 of the smaller bodies also dominates the relative velocity and we assume that @xmath36 , where @xmath19 and @xmath3 correspond to , respectively , the hill and escape velocity of the big body .",
    "this is the dispersion dominated regime and these assumptions are typical for oligarchy . using @xmath37 with @xmath38",
    "the width of the heating region and @xmath39 an order - of - unity factor , one finds that the runaway growth - oligarchy transition according to equation  ( [ eq : im93 ] ) lies at a radius of ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath40^{1/5 } =     94\\ \\mathrm{km } \\left ( \\frac{a}{5 } \\right)^{1/5 } \\left ( \\frac{\\rho}{\\mathrm{g\\ cm^{-3 } } } \\right)^{-2/15 } \\\\    & \\times & \\left ( \\frac{\\sigma}{10\\ \\mathrm{g\\ cm^{-2 } } } \\right)^{1/5 } \\left ( \\frac{a}{\\mathrm{au } } \\right)^{2/5 } \\left ( \\frac{r_0}{10\\ \\mathrm{km } } \\right)^{3/5}.    \\label{eq : roli}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the dispersion - dominated regime inclinations @xmath41 are related to eccentricities @xmath42 as @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate of the big bodies then becomes @xmath44 @xcite where @xmath42 is the rms - eccentricity of the small bodies , which is related to @xmath4 as @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath46 is a factor of order unity that takes into account the increased accretion rate under a distribution of velocities . with the above definitions we transform equation  ( [ eq : dmdt ] ) into hill units @xmath47 and define the accretion timescale in the 2-component approximation as @xmath48 where we defined the dimensionless @xmath49 .",
    "the timescale for viscous stirring of the small bodies is given by @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a coulomb factor and @xmath52 the _ number density _ of perturbers .",
    "this latter quantity is obtained from the assumption that each small bodies ` sees ' one oligarch .",
    "the volume traversed by the small bodies is the product of @xmath53 ( their circumference ) , @xmath54 ( the width in the radial direction ) , and @xmath55 ( the vertical excursion ) . here",
    ", @xmath56 represents the corresponding vertical velocities as given by the inclinations @xmath41 ( = @xmath57 ) of the bodies .",
    "thus , the effective number density of the single oligarch is @xmath58 .",
    "then , equation  ( [ eq : tvs1 ] ) transforms into @xmath59 with @xmath60 .",
    "presents an example of the runaway growth parameter study we have recently conducted @xcite .",

    "in a the mass spectrum is shown at several times during the simulation run .",
    "after the radius of the most massive body , @xmath61 , has increased by a factor 2 a new curve is plotted ; the corresponding times are indicated in the legend .",
    "it is seen that the number density spectrum @xmath62 evolves into a power law , @xmath63 with @xmath11 . near the end of the simulation bodies",
    "have separated : the oligarchs .    in b",
    "additional information for this run is presented as function of the evolutionary parameter @xmath61 .",
    "the black curve shows the ratio of the most massive particle ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 , which is the mass - weighed average of the distribution , @xmath66 .",
    "for a two component model @xmath67 should increase if the system is in runaway growth @xcite .",
    "it can be seen , however , that this ratio flattens near @xmath68 km and decreases after @xmath0600 km .",
    "the fluctuations in this curve are caused by merging of bodies of similar size .",
    "also plotted is @xmath69 , the ratio of the largest random velocity of the smallest bodies over the hill velocity of @xmath70 .",
    "it first decreases ( gravitational focusing increases ) until @xmath71 km , where @xmath69 reaches a minimum .",
    "this radius is denoted the transition radius , @xmath17 , indicated by the vertical dotted line .",
    "time is plotted by the grey curve on the second , _ linear _ , y - axis .",
    "after @xmath69 has reached its minimum this curve noticeably steepens . only from this point",
    "onwards does dynamical heating win over the increase of @xmath19 through accretion , and the accretion timescale increases .",
    "bodies in other zones , spatially separated from @xmath70 , then find the chance to catch up .",
    "the simulations show that during the runaway growth stage @xmath72 grows exponentially with time ( @xmath61 is linear on a semilog plot ) and an exponential fit is appropriate , @xmath73 with @xmath15 the runaway growth timescale ( see b , thin solid line ) . in this quantity has been plotted for several runs performed at 1 , 6 , and 35 au .",
    "we express @xmath15 in terms of the fiducial timescale @xmath74 and derive the dimensionless @xmath75 , @xmath76 during the initial evolution @xmath77 ( ) and also @xmath78 ( ) . we find that the size and velocity spectrum that develops during runaway growth enables the biggest body to accrete particles from all masses , i.e. ,  also intermediate mass bodies @xcite , which decreases @xmath15 compared to its 2-component estimate .",
    "similarly , despite the fact that random velocities ( @xmath79 ) increase during runaway growth , the stirring by a _",
    "single _ biggest body is simply insignificant to shape the dynamical evolution of the smaller bodies .",
    "instead it is the _ ensemble _ of large and intermediate mass bodies that produces the stirring .",
    "a two component approximation is just too simple a picture for the runaway growth phase .",
    "although initially @xmath80 and @xmath81 , during the runaway growth phase @xmath69 decreases and both @xmath16 and ( especially ) @xmath14 rapidly converge on @xmath15 . at the point where @xmath82 the runaway body starts to dynamically",
    "heat its environment at a rate faster than its previous accretion rate .",
    "thus , from this point the runaway growth can no longer ` outpace ' the stirring .",
    "a single body dominates its neighborhood in terms of both velocity evolution and accretion , meaning a much slower growth rate because accretion now becomes self - regulated .",
    "this is of course the key characteristic of oligarchy .",
    "conversely , we may suspect that the condition @xmath83 heralds the end of the runaway growth stage and the transition to oligarchy .",
    "in we have plotted the ratio of these timescales over @xmath15 _ at the point where @xmath69 is at its minimum _",
    "( i.e. ,  at @xmath84 ) . in evaluating @xmath16 and @xmath14",
    "we have taken @xmath85 ( @xcite ; @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 ( @xcite , @xmath88 ) . because the @xmath70 vs.  @xmath89 curve ( b ) differs from simulation to simulation ( e.g. ,  when including gas drag and fragmentation ) the timescales @xmath16 and @xmath90 also evolve differently . however , from it is clear that at @xmath91 all the relevant timescales are similar : @xmath92 , irrespective of the simulation .",
    "thus , the 2-component model becomes first applicable at the point where gravitational focusing reaches its maximum .",
    "this is the start of oligarchy . from now on",
    ", @xmath15 loses its meaning ( runaway growth ceases ) , @xmath69 increases , and accretion timescales are given by @xmath16 ( which also increases ) .",
    "equating the relevant timescales , i.e. ,  equations  ( [ eq : tac ] ) , ( [ eq : tvs ] ) , and ( [ eq : trg ] ) , we solve for both @xmath17 and @xmath93 @xmath94^{1/7},\\\\     \\label{eq : uvhtr }    \\left ( \\frac{v_x}{v_h } \\right)_\\mathrm{tr } & = & \\sqrt{\\frac{k_\\mathrm{rg } r_0}{\\alpha k_\\mathrm{ac}r_\\mathrm{tr}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation  ( [ eq : r - rg1 ] ) supersedes @xmath9 of equation  ( [ eq : roli ] ) as the new criterion between the runaway growth and oligarchy accretion phases .",
    "using the above expressions for @xmath95 and @xmath96 and inserting equation  ( [ eq : alpha ] ) for @xmath28 we find that equation  ( [ eq : r - rg1 ] ) transforms into @xmath97 where the prefactor is @xmath03 times larger than equation  ( [ eq : roli ] ) . any order - of - unity uncertainty in the relation @xmath98",
    "can be regarded as an uncertainty in the @xmath99-factors , but this affects the prefactor only marginally .",
    "more fundamentally , equation  ( [ eq : r - rg ] ) shows different dependencies on @xmath34 , @xmath100 , and , especially , @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath34 is large , e.g. ,  @xmath101 km , @xmath9 and @xmath17 give approximately the same values at 1 au .",
    "a large @xmath34 is the favored outcome of recent numerical simulations involving a turbulent layer of densely packed boulders @xcite .",
    "then , the domain of runaway growth is rather limited ( a factor three in size ) ; but it still produces @xmath010@xmath1 km objects .    in",
    "we illustrate the runaway growth / oligarchy turnover point of @xcite ( , _ dashed _ lines ) and equation  ( [ eq : r - rg ] ) ( _ solid _ lines ) as function of distance @xmath22 for an initial planetesimal radius of @xmath102 and an internal density of @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath104 we adopt a minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) profile @xcite ( _ black _ lines ) and a profile ten times larger than this ( _ grey _ lines ) . in it",
    "can be seen that the difference between the two criteria becomes largest in the outer disk ( @xmath105 au ) : whereas according to the @xcite prescription the transition takes place at radii of @xmath0100 km , the new criterion shifts it upwards to @xmath010@xmath1 km .",
    "according to our findings , the transition between the runaway growth and oligarchic growth phases is characterized by the following properties :    * a power - law size distribution of mass index @xmath11 , extending from the initial size @xmath34 to the transition size @xmath17 as given by equation  ( [ eq : r - rg ] ) ; * the random velocity @xmath4 of the planetesimal bodies ( of size @xmath0@xmath34 ) , via equation  ( [ eq : uvhtr ] ) ; * the timescale , via equation  ( [ eq : trg ] ) . here",
    ", @xmath15 must be multiplied by a term @xmath0@xmath106 to account for the several e - foldings of enjoyed growth .",
    "then we obtain @xmath107 for the time until the transition .",
    "it is remarkable that this short timescale depends on the initial conditions only , a result that is unique to the runaway growth phase .",
    "we assess the implications of these findings for the broader context of planet formation .",
    "first , we do not expect the final timescales of core formation to be much influenced by the new transition radius , since these are set by the much slower oligarchy stage that supersedes runaway growth .",
    "indeed , semi - analytical studies of oligarchic growth required additional mechanisms like gas damping , fragmentation , or migration to produce embryos on reasonable timescales ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand ,",
    "gap formation @xcite will increase formation timescales .",
    "recently , @xcite investigate core - formation scenarios using @xmath108-body techniques .",
    "the aim of that study was to understand how efficient planetesimal accretion proceeds during the phase where an earth - size planetary embryo has to grow to a mass of @xmath0@xmath109 to be able to accrete the nebula gas and become a gas giant .",
    "they recognize the importance of processes like planetesimal scattering , planetesimal orbital decay due to gas drag ( both processes quench the growth ) , and planetesimal - driven embryo migration ( which is conducive to growth ) .",
    "the outcome of these simulations , furthermore , is found to depend on the initial setup of the simulation , i.e. ,  the size distribution of the planetesimals . given the significance that is attached to the wholesale redistribution of matter , it would also be of interest to assess the importance of these effects for the early oligarchy stage , e.g. ,  to perform @xmath110body simulations with embryos radii starting at the transition mass @xmath17 .",
    "the second implication of our study concerns the kuiper belt .",
    "our results strongly suggest that the kuiper belt is primarily the product of the runaway growth phase .",
    "first , assuming that the initial surface density is approximately mmsn or larger ( @xmath111 ) , the biggest @xmath010@xmath1 km bodies ( plutinos ) can be produced by runaway growth .",
    "second , the observed mass distribution @xmath62 for the largest kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) obeys a power - law with @xmath11 .",
    "recent studies find a power - law size index @xmath112 ( as in @xmath113 ) of @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ; @xcite ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ; @xcite ) .",
    "( the size distribution of the kuiper belt s smallest bodies is collisionally dominated , though , and @xmath112 is much lower . ) the large @xmath112 , together with the fact that the kbo size distribution is continuous rather than bimodal as in the end stage of a , argue that it has evolved only very little since runaway growth and has not been significantly shaped by oligarchic growth .    in order to produce the kbos in a sufficiently short time span , kuiper belt formation scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) assume that the initial belt contained much more mass than the @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) that is present today @xcite .",
    "neptune formation and/or another dynamical shakeup event ( as in the nice model ) subsequently depleted 99% of its mass @xcite . using our results",
    ", we can verify these findings .",
    "assuming @xmath120 au , we find @xmath121 which readily shows the need for an enhanced surface density over the current one : for @xmath119 either @xmath17 becomes too low or @xmath122 too long .",
    "thus , we conclude that the kbo size distribution as seen today is consistent with a scenario of being a leftover product of the initial runaway growth phase and has since been depleted .",
    "these findings are in line with the simulations of @xcite , where growth also stalls after @xmath0@xmath123 km bodies have been formed .",
    "further growth is impeded since oligarchic accretion timescales become too long , even at enhanced surface densities .",
    "we acknowledge the helpful comments of the ( anonymous ) referee and his / her encouragement to put our results into a broader context .",
