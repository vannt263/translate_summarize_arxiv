    "<S> are generic enough so as to include findings like those presented by cartas - fuentevilla , escalante - hernndez , and berra - montiel in the section 6 of ref .  .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> a detailed analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath0 bf theory with and without cosmological constant is carried out . </S>",
    "<S> such an analysis is performed using the covariant canonical formalism as well as dirac s canonical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , spacetime diffeomorphisms and internal symmetries are analyzed too ( on the issue of the symmetries , see also ref .   ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the crucial results reported there is the analysis of the reducibility of some of the first - class constraints for @xmath0 and @xmath1 bf theory with and without cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reported in ref .   is actually generic and holds for any @xmath2 theory with and without cosmological constant . to appreciate this , </S>",

    "<S> when the dirac s canonical analysis of the action ( [ bfaction ] ) is performed , one gets precisely the analogous results of those reported in the appendix of ref .  , but replacing in such formulae the pair of antisymmetric indices @xmath13 ( associated with the lie algebra of so(4 ) ) with the index @xmath14 of this comment ( associated with the lie algebra spanned by @xmath7 ) . in particular </S>",

    "<S> there are @xmath21 constraints in the gauss law @xmath22 , @xmath18 first - class constraints in @xmath23 , and there are @xmath21 reducibility equations ( [ redu ] ) . therefore , the counting gives @xmath24 local and physical degrees of freedom . </S>",

    "<S> there is nothing special in the specific internal lie group or lie algebra under consideration [ @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath25 for example ] , what matters is that the lie algebra is endowed with a non - degenerate inner product . because of this , to make the analysis using one group or other is irrelevant . in particular </S>",
