    "with the discovery @xcite of the higgs boson associated with the higgs mechanism @xcite , it has become imperative to determine whether the higgs boson is an elementary field that appears in the fundamental lagrangian of nature , or whether it is a fermion - antifermion composite bound state .",
    "if the higgs boson is to be elementary , one has to explain why its quadratically divergent self - energy is not regularized at a very high grandunified or planck mass scale ( the hierarchy problem ) , and one has to explain why the cosmological constant term that the higgs field induces when it acquires a non - vanishing vacuum expectation value is not at the same mass scale as the 125 gev mass that the higgs boson is now known to have .",
    "if the higgs boson is to be composite , one needs to develop a suitable dynamical mass generation scheme in a renormalizable quantum field theory that would not only not lead to an unacceptably high mass for the higgs boson or an unacceptably large cosmological constant term , but would recover the successful standard phenomenology associated with an elementary higgs boson . here",
    "we present a dynamical scheme that does this , a scheme that does not differ from an elementary higgs boson theory when the higgs boson is off shell ( off - shell higgs exchange and loop diagrams ) , but does differ from it on the mass shell . on shell",
    "the dynamical scheme requires that the higgs boson be a narrow resonance just above threshold , with its width being a diagnostic that could potentially distinguish a dynamical higgs boson from an elementary one .",
    "the dynamical scheme that we study is a quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) theory as realized by critical scaling with anomalous dimensions in the ultraviolet , and by the non - vanishing of the vacuum expectation value of the composite operator @xmath1 due infrared dynamics , with the dynamical dimension of @xmath1 being reduced from three to two .",
    "it has long been known that because of the baker - johnson mass renormalization anomaly @xcite , if such critical scaling is to occur no dynamical pseudoscalar goldstone or scalar higgs boson is generated , with the chiral symmetry being broken in the lagrangian , and with the theory actually corresponding to a theory with an intrinsic mass with lagrangian @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the fact that there would be no composite bound states in a critical scaling qed has a parallel in the chiral - invariant nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) four - fermion model @xcite , where the lagrangian is broken into two pieces , a mean - field piece and a residual interaction , with the mean - field sector piece containing a mass term that is not present in the original njl lagrangian .",
    "neither of these two pieces is separately chirally symmetric , with the composite bound states being found not in the mean - field sector at all but in the residual interaction sector .",
    "thus by augmenting a massless fermion @xmath5 with a four - fermion interaction , we can recognize an @xmath6 with its fermion mass term as a mean - field theory , and as such this sector should not have any composite bound states since a mean - field sector never does .",
    "however , dynamical goldstone and higgs boson bound states are generated by the four - fermion residual interaction . and with @xmath7 acting as an operator",
    "whose dynamical dimension has been reduced from six to four , the four - fermion sector is power - counting renormalizable , and the mass of the ensuing higgs boson is found to be both finite and at the same mass scale as that of the dynamically generated fermion rather than at a high regulator mass scale . by coupling the theory to an equally conformal invariant gravity theory ( conformal gravity ) , the interplay between the gravity and four - fermion sector is found to take care of the cosmological constant that is induced by the dynamical symmetry breaking procedure .",
    "since our interest in this paper is in studying critical scaling in a four - fermion theory , we will need to generalize the standard analysis of the njl model .",
    "in fact our approach will be seen to lead us to a renormalizable version of the njl model . the njl action @xmath8",
    "^ 2-\\frac{g}{2}[\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^5\\psi]^2\\right ] \\label{l1a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is invariant under chiral transformations of the form @xmath9 , with the chiral symmetry preventing the presence of any fermion mass term in the action .",
    "nonetheless , a fermion mass can be induced dynamically in the model . a direct way to show",
    "this is to introduce a mass term , and break the action into mean - field and residual interaction pieces according to @xmath10 , where @xmath11,\\qquad i_{\\rm ri}=\\int d^4x \\left[-\\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi-\\frac{m}{g}\\right)^2-\\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^5\\psi\\right)^2\\right ] .",

    "critical scaling and the finiteness of @xmath57 is achievable if @xmath63 , with one then asymptotically having @xmath64 the vanishing of @xmath65 can be achieved in various ways .",

    "for an abelian gauge theory this could only occur non - perturbatively , while for a non - abelian one , with an appropriate fermion content the second - order term in @xmath66 could have the opposite sign to that of the first - order term , to then permit a perturbative cancellation .",
    "however , for our purposes here , one does not need to actually require that @xmath65 have such a zero , since one could instead work in the much studied quenched approximation in which one keeps the photon canonical ( i.e. @xmath65 is zero for all @xmath66 and there is no charge renormalization ) .",
    "in this approximation , one obtains the asymptotic scaling form for @xmath59 if one sums all photon exchange diagrams both planar and non - planar combined @xcite , doing so for any value of the coupling constant . or one could keep quenched planar graphs alone and then @xcite get scaling if @xmath67 , with the dynamical dimension @xmath68 of @xmath1 being given by @xmath69 . in all of these cases",
    "the dressing of the @xmath1 vertex with quenched photons converts the point @xmath70 green s function into the dressed @xmath71 , and that is the only requirement that we will need for this work as it will soften the point vertices if @xmath72 , and lead to completely finite scalar and pseudoscalar channel fermion - antifermion scattering amplitudes if @xmath73 .",

    ", @xmath77 is finite . with a zero @xmath78 and a non - zero @xmath14 this looks like dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "however , with @xmath79 effecting @xmath80 , @xmath81 is not zero . because of this",
    ", chiral symmetry is broken in the lagrangian , and there is no associated goldstone boson @xcite .    in the quenched planar graph approximation",
    "it was found @xcite that if @xmath82 the fermion propagator does not scale asymptotically and there then is a goldstone boson .",
    "thus the prevailing wisdom from that time on has been that the generation of dynamical goldstone bosons is associated with strong coupling only ( cf .",
    "@xmath83 ) . in this paper and the more detailed @xcite",
    "we revisit this wisdom and show that there can be a goldstone boson even for weak coupling and critical scaling .",
    "however , since there is none in the fermion gauge boson theory itself , we will need to embed the theory in a larger chiral invariant one , namely an njl type theory , one that would be power - counting renormalizable if @xmath84 , since then @xmath7 would act as an operator whose dynamical dimension is reduced from six to four .",

    "thus in the second term in ( [ l16a ] ) the only terms that will survive will be those that are linear in @xmath92 .",
    "with the kernel being no more divergent than @xmath93 if the photon is canonical , then given ( [ l14a ] ) and ( [ l15a ] ) , the @xmath92 terms will appear in an integral that is finite .",
    "one can thus drop the @xmath78 dependence in the second term in ( [ l16a ] ) . in consequence , ( [ l16a ] ) becomes a self - consistent homogeneous equation for @xmath91 , and since ( [ l16a ] ) involves a difference of two propagators it has better asymptotic convergence properties than the unrenormalized schwinger - dyson equation @xmath94 .",
    "as such , ( [ l16a ] ) can have the asymptotic solution @xmath95 as given in ( [ l14a ] ) above .",
    "however , since ( [ l16a ] ) is homogeneous , it can also have the completely trivial solution @xmath96 ( i.e. both @xmath78 and @xmath14 identically zero ) . the trivial solution to ( [ l16a ] )",
    "is thus associated with the lagrangian @xmath97 , while the non - trivial solution is associated with @xmath3 .",

    "since the ultraviolet behavior of @xmath165 is the same as that of @xmath166 ( the short - distance behavior of the theory being chirally symmetric as the chiral symmetry is only broken by mass generation in the infrared ) , the quantity @xmath167 is completely finite as well .",
    "thus to lowest order in @xmath114 in the @xmath155 matrix kernel , the four - fermion interaction gives cutoff - independent results , due to the softening of the @xmath168 and @xmath169 vertices from their point - coupled @xmath170 and @xmath171 values in the njl model , to the dressed @xmath172^{-1/4}$ ] and @xmath172^{-1/4}i\\gamma^5 $ ] forms that they take when @xmath73 . to establish the renormalizability of a four - fermion interaction with these dressed vertices , we need to dress the kernel to all orders in the four - fermion coupling constant @xmath114 .",
    "we thus need to dress @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath100 and @xmath173 with internal fermion loop graphs .",
    "when this is done , it is found @xcite that no new divergences beyond the lowest order single logarithm are generated , with their coefficients still being equal .",
    "the all - order in @xmath114 renormalizability of the four - fermion theory with dressed @xmath168 and @xmath169 vertices with @xmath73 is thus established .    in the literature",
    "there have been many studies of an abelian gluon model coupled to a four - fermion interaction .",
    "one of the first times the @xmath125 theory was explored in the literature was in @xcite , though in that paper only its mean - field aspects were studied and not the residual interaction aspects that we have presented here .",
    "one of the first studies of the residual interaction dynamics associated with @xmath125 was presented in @xcite , with this and other studies ( as recently detailed in @xcite ) finding that dynamical symmetry breaking would occur if @xmath66 and @xmath114 were related according to @xmath174 . and as the presence of @xmath22 indicates , these studies all involved a cutoff .",
    "the studies that lead to this relation differ from the study presented here in a crucial way . while these studies were based on the quenched planar graph approximation so that they did involve a fermion propagator @xmath175 that scaled with an anomalous dimension just as given as per ( [ l14a ] ) in our study",
    ", these studies did not implement the callan - symanzik equation ( [ l13a ] ) and did not use the dressed @xmath61 given in ( [ l14a ] ) , but instead took it to be given by the point - coupled @xmath70 .",
    "thus for the tadpole @xmath176 , instead of setting it equal to@xmath177 $ ] as we did in ( [ l21a ] ) , in these studies it was set equal to @xmath178 $ ] . without the dressed @xmath61",
    "the tadpole was not softened enough ( even with @xmath73 ) , to hence require the use of a cutoff .",
    "however , in our case the tadpole is softened sufficiently to make it renormalizable . with our study also being an all - order planar plus non - planar graph quenched photon study , we are not constrained by the planar graph @xmath174 relation , a relation that imposes a lower bound on @xmath114 .",
    "rather , in our case ( [ l21a ] ) imposes no lower bound on @xmath114 , with it only being required to be negative ( viz .",
    "attractive ) .",
    "moreover , if @xmath65 does have a zero , and if it is given by the fine - structure constant , @xmath66 and @xmath114 could then both be weak and still lead to dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "one is thus able to associate dynamical symmetry breaking with weak coupling , with strong coupling not being required at all .",
    "the path integral associated with the massless fermion @xmath179 is of the form @xmath180\\exp\\bigg{[}i\\int d^4x \\bigg{(}\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi -e\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}a_{\\mu}\\psi-\\frac{g}{2}(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^2+\\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta\\bigg{)}\\bigg{]}. \\label{l32a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( not displayed are the @xmath181 integration measure , a source term for @xmath181 , or @xmath182 . ) on introducing a dummy field @xmath183 we can rewrite the path integral as @xmath184\\exp\\bigg{[}i\\int d^4x \\bigg{(}\\bar{\\psi}i\\gamma^{\\mu } \\partial_{\\mu}\\psi -e\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}a_{\\mu}\\psi-\\frac{g}{2}(\\bar{\\psi}\\psi)^2+\\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{g}-\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\right)^2+\\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta\\bigg{)}\\bigg { ] } \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int d[\\bar{\\psi},\\psi,\\sigma]\\exp\\bigg{[}i\\int d^4x \\bigg{(}\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}i\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi -e\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}a_{\\mu}\\psi-\\sigma\\bar{\\psi}\\psi + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2 g } + \\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta\\bigg{)}\\bigg{]}. \\label{l33a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we recognize the path integral lagrangian that we obtain as being of precisely the same form as the mean - field @xmath185 given above , with @xmath186 replacing @xmath31 . on introducing @xmath187 as the fourier transform of @xmath61 , on doing a path integration over the fermions we obtain an effective action in the @xmath186 sector of the form @xmath188\\exp[i\\int d^4x{{\\cal l}}_{\\rm eff}]$ ] where @xmath189 $ ] . on expanding in derivatives of @xmath186 , we recognize @xmath190 as being the effective higgs lagrangian given in ( [ l24a ] ) , to thus generate a kinetic energy term for @xmath186 .",
    "however , while the path integral looks like that of an elementary scalar field , there is one key difference : there is no @xmath191 source term for @xmath186 .",
    "the function @xmath192 only depends on the fermion sources , while if the scalar field were to be elementary the path integral would be associated with @xmath193 instead . with one and",
    "the same lagrangian , the off - shell scalar field ( internal exchange and loop diagrams ) contributions to green s functions with external fermion legs as generated by either @xmath192 or @xmath193 would be identical , with it being the all - order iteration of internal @xmath183 exchange diagrams that would generate the dynamical goldstone and higgs bosons that are not present in the @xmath183 field action itself .",
    "however , @xmath193 would also allow for green s functions with external boson legs as well .",
    "thus elementary and dynamical higgs bosons only differ when the higgs field goes on shell , while not differing off shell at all . with the higgs width being an on - shell property of the higgs field ,",
    "again we see that it is in the width of the higgs boson that one could potentially distinguish between a dynamical higgs boson and an elementary one .",
    "if we evaluate the zero - point vacuum energy density of a free massive fermion with equation of motion @xmath194\\psi=0 $ ] and energy - momentum tensor @xmath195 , from the filled negative energy sea fermion modes we obtain @xmath196 to thus generate quartic , quadratic , and logarithmic divergences . in flat spacetime one is only interested in energy - density differences , and so one can subtract off the zero - point vacuum energy density @xmath197 associated with a free massless fermion , to yield the energy - density difference @xmath100 .",
    "if one then makes a further subtraction via the mean - field @xmath27 , one is left with a logarithmic divergence .",
    "if , on the other hand , one is in a critical scaling theory with @xmath73 , the mass independent quartic term in @xmath100 is not affected , while the quadratic divergence term becomes logarithmically divergent and the logarithmic divergence becomes finite .",
    "then , the mean - field @xmath34 is completely finite .",
    "now if one couples to gravity , one is not actually free to simply subtract away any infinite energy density contribution since gravity couples to energy density itself and not to energy - density difference .",
    "thus to take care of the critical scaling logarithmically divergent term we need a dynamics that would induce an appropriate counterterm .",
    "as we have seen , such a counterterm can be supplied by a four - fermion interaction , an interaction that would even be renormalizable if @xmath73 .",
    "it is thus gravity that forces the four - fermion interaction upon us , with it then serving to both renormalize the mean - field energy density and generate dynamical bound states . to cancel off the quartically divergent term",
    "we would need some additional field contribution , one that would have to be due to a boson since a bosonic zero - point energy density has the opposite sign to that of a fermion .",
    "such a contribution could be provided by a supersymmetric partner of the fermion , but when the superpartner gets a mass it generates a new quadratic divergence , to thus give an unacceptably large vacuum energy density .",
    "an alternative bosonic field would be the gravitational field itself since it is also bosonic .",
    "however , no cancellation can be achieved via standard einstein gravity , since as a quantum theory it is not renormalizable . however , conformal gravity @xcite , viz . gravity based on the conformal invariant action @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the",
    "weyl conformal tensor , is renormalizable , and ghost free @xcite .",
    "so now the cancellation can consistently be effected .",
    "specifically , if one defines @xmath200 , the conformal gravity equations of motion take the form @xmath201 , with the gravitational and matter vacuum zero - point energy densities then canceling each other , with all the vacuum contributions , including those that arise due to the change in vacuum from @xmath16 to @xmath15 taking care of each other identically .",
    "( this differs from the elementary higgs field case because there the shift in energy density is not cancelled . ) with the vacuum contributions all taking care of each other when dynamical symmetry breaking is coupled to conformal gravity , what is observed in cosmology is only the much smaller contribution of the positive energy one - particle states ( one - particle matrix elements of @xmath202 ) that lie above the vacuum , and not the contribution due the entire filled vacuum itself @xcite . in this way",
    "the cosmological constant is under control ."
