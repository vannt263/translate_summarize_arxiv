    "the base paired structure of an rna is called its secondary structure . because watson - crick pairs are such a stereotyped and relatively simple interaction , accurate rna secondary structure prediction appears to be an achievable goal .",
    "a rather reliable approach for rna structure prediction is comparative sequence analysis , in which covarying residues ( e.g. compensatory mutations ) are identified in a multiple sequence alignment of rnas with similar structures but different sequences ( woese & pace , 1993 ) . covarying residues , particularly pairs which covary to maintain watson - crick complementarity , are indicative of conserved base pairing interactions .",

    "the zuker algorithm requires @xmath4 time and @xmath5 space for a sequence of length @xmath6 , and so is reasonably efficient and practical even for large rna sequences .",

    "some virus rna genomes [ such as turnip yellow mosaic virus ( tymv ) ( guilley _ et al _ , 1979 ) ] present a trna - like structure at their @xmath14 end that includes a pseudoknot in the aminoacyl acceptor arm very close to the @xmath14 end ( kolk _ et al _ , 1998 ; florentz _ et al .",
    "_ , 1982 ; dumas _ et al _ , 1987 ) .",
    "our program predicts correctly the tymv trna - like structure with its pseudoknot for the last @xmath92 bases at the @xmath14 end with @xmath93 kcal / mol ( the mfold @xmath83 prediction for tymv has a free energy of @xmath94 kcal / mol ) . the trna - like @xmath14 terminal structure is conserved among tymoviruses and also for the tobacco mosaic virus cowpea strain ( cctmv ) another valine acceptor . of the seven valine - acceptor trna - like structures proposed to date ( van belkum _",
    "et al _ , 1987 ) we reproduce six of them , except for kennedya yellow mosaic virus ( kymv ) .",
    "finally we have considered the last @xmath95 bases of the @xmath14 terminal of the tobacco mosaic virus ( tmv ) ( van belkum _",
    "et al _ , 1985 ) .",
    "tmv also has a trna - like structure at the end , but it may have additional upstream pseudoknots , up to a total of five , forming a long quasi - continuous helix .",
    "we folded the upstream and downstream regions separately in a piece of 84 nucleotides ( the folding requires 52 minutes and 9.8 mb ) and 105 nucleotides ( the folding requires 246 minutes and 22.5 mb ) respectively .",
    "our program predicts the 105 nucleotides downstream region exactly with @xmath96 kcal / mol . for the 84 nucleotides upstream region",
    "we find four of the five helical regions with @xmath97 kcal / mol .",
    "in this paper we present an algorithm able to predict pseudoknots by dynamic programming .",
    "this algorithm demonstrates that using certain approximations consistent with the accepted turner thermodynamic model , the prediction of pseudoknotted structures is a problem of polynomial complexity ( although admittedly high ) .",
    "having an optimal dynamic programming algorithm will enable extending other dynamic programming based methods that rigorously explore the conformational space for rna folding ( mccaskill , 1990 ; bonhoeffer _ et al .",
    "_ , 1993 ) to pseudoknotted structures .",
    "apart from the usefulness of the algorithm in predicting pseudoknots , we also include coaxial energies ( when two stems stack coaxially ) , a very common feature of rna folding .",
    "we expect mfold will also include coaxial energies in the near future ( matthews _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "our algorithm is presented in the context of a general framework in which a generic folding is expressed in terms of its elementary secondary interactions ( which we have identified as the irreducible surfaces ) .",
    "this is a further generalization of sankoff s result ( 1985 ) .",
    "the calculation of an optimal folding becomes an expansion in iss of increasingly higher order .",
    "our formalization incorporates all current dynamic programming rna folding algorithms in addition to our pseudoknot algorithm .",
    "it also establishes the limitations of each approximation by determining at which order the expansion is truncated .    as for the thermodynamic implementation presented in this paper ,",
    "one of our major problems is the almost complete lack of thermodynamic information about pseudoknot configurations .",
    "the thermodynamic algorithm is also sensitive to the accuracy of the existing thermodynamic parameters .",
    "we expect to improve this aspect by implementing the more complete set of parameters provided by the turner group ( matthews _ et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) .",
    "the principal drawback is the time and memory constraints imposed by the computational complexity of the algorithm . at this early stage",
    ", we can not analyze sequences much larger than 130 - 140 bases . for now the program is adequate for folding small rnas .",
    "a 100 nucleotide rna takes about 4 hours and 22.5 mb to fold on an sgi r10k origin200 .    due to practical limitations , at a given point in the recursion we only allow the incorporation of two gap matrices .",
    "however , since each of those gap matrices can in turn be assembled by other two of those matrices , it implies that the algorithm includes in its configuration space a large variety of knotted motifs .",
    "the limitations of this truncation appeared when we considered applying this approach to describe pairwise residue interactions in protein folding .",
    "a parallel @xmath98-sheet configuration provides an example of a complicated knotted folding that can not be handled by the pseudoknot algorithm presented in this paper .",
    "however , all known rna pseudoknots can be handled by the algorithm , which makes the approximation useful enough for rna secondary structure .",
    "although we implemented the algorithm for energy minimization , extending mfold to pseudoknotted structures , the algorithm is not limited to energy minimization .",
    "our algorithm can be converted into a probabilistic model for pseudoknot - containing rna folding .",
    "probabilistic models of rna secondary structure based on `` stochastic context free grammar '' ( scfg ) formalisms ( eddy _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; sakakibara _ et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ; lefebvre , 1996 ) have been introduced both for rna single - sequence folding and for rna structural alignment and structural similarity searches .",
    "the inside and cyk dynamic programming algorithms used for scfg - based structural alignment are fundamentally similar to the zuker algorithm ( durbin _ et al . _ , 1998 ) , and have consequently also been unable to deal with pseudoknots .",
    "heuristic approaches to applying scfg - like structural alignment models to pseudoknots have been introduced ( brown , 1996 ; notredame _ et al .",
    "_ , 1997 ) .",
    "an scfg - like probabilistic version of our pseudoknot algorithm could be designed to obtain optimal structural alignment of pseudoknot - containing rnas .",
    "the algorithm was implemented on a silicon graphics origin200 .",
    "the algorithm has a theoretical worst - case complexity of @xmath99 in time and @xmath100 in storage . at its present stage ,",
    "the program is empirically observed to run @xmath101 in time and @xmath102 in memory .",
    "for instance , a trna of @xmath103 nucleotides takes 24 minutes and uses @xmath104 mb of memory .",
    "the @xmath14 end of tobacco mosaic virus has @xmath105 nucleotides and takes @xmath106 minutes and uses @xmath107 mb .",
    "the program empirically scales above the theoretical complexity in time of the algorithm .",
    "this effect seems to have to do with the way the machine allocates memory for larger rnas .",
    "the software and parameter sets are available by request from e. rivas ( elena@genetics.wustl.edu ) .",
    "we should also remember that the algorithm uses two different @xmath18 matrices depending on whether the subset @xmath113 is free - standing ( @xmath18 ) or appears inside a multiloop ( in which case we use @xmath57 ) .",
    "both recursions are identical apart from having different coefficients as described in table  [ nestedparam ] .",
