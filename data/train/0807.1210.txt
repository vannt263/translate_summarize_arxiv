    "many modern extensions of the standard model of particle physics , including string theory and various other approaches aiming at unification of quantum mechanics with general relativity , suggest that the lorentz symmetry may be broken or modified at energy and length scales approaching the planck scale .",
    "while such effects necessarily have to be tiny at energies up to the electroweak scale in order to satisfy laboratory constraints  @xcite , they can be magnified at higher energies as they can occur in astrophysics .",
    "the observation of standard radiation processes as they are predicted in the absence of lorentz invariance violation then often allows to derive strong constraints on lorentz invariance violating ( liv ) effects  @xcite .",
    "liv effects could , for example , change the propagation and thus spectra and composition of the highest energy particles observed in nature @xcite .",
    "in particular , photons are produced as secondaries of cosmic rays but are quickly reabsorbed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) if lorentz symmetry holds .",
    "if photon interactions with the microwave background were inhibited by new physics near the planck scale @xmath1 , a significant fraction of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmic rays above @xmath2 ev would be photons , in contradiction to current experimental upper limits  @xcite . based on this argument , in ref .",
    "@xcite we put strong constraints on the coefficients of liv terms of the form @xmath3 , @xmath4 , in the dispersion relation for photons of energy @xmath5 , assuming for simplicity , that the corresponding parameters for electrons and positrons are significantly smaller .",
    "these latter terms can , however , play an equally important role because they can influence the kinematics of pair production , @xmath6 , the most important process for absorption of high energy photons in the background of low energy photons @xmath7 , such as the cmb . in the present work we , therefore , extend those studies to all three liv terms that are allowed at first and second order suppression with the planck scale in the dispersion relations of photons , electrons and positrons from general principles of effective field theory , without making any assumptions on the relative size of these parameters .",
    "we obtain three - dimensional exclusion plots for the coefficients of these terms , following from the non - observation of photons above @xmath8ev .",
    "we also show how the excluded regions in these three - dimensional parameter ranges would be extended if ultra - high energy photons were detected in the future . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that primary cosmic rays are dominated by protons .    for the coefficients of liv terms",
    "linearly suppressed with the planck scale values larger than @xmath9 for electrons and positrons are currently ruled out by the observation of synchrotron radiation from the crab nebula @xcite .",
    "we find that the observation of photons above @xmath8ev would rule out that any one of the three liv coefficients for electrons , positrons and photons has absolute value @xmath10 .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite which considers a two dimensional subset of the general three - dimensional parameter range .",
    "in contrast , we will find that for liv terms quadratically suppressed with the planck scale , arbitrarily large values of one of the liv terms for electrons and positrons can not be ruled out by uhe photon observations if the coefficients of the two other liv terms have absolute value @xmath11 .",

    "iii we determine the thresholds for pair production and photon decay , and in sect .",
    "iv we derive the resulting constraints on the liv parameters . finally , we summarize and conclude in sect .",

    "( [ eq : disp_e ] ) for electrons denotes positive ( negative ) helicity .",
    "the liv parameters @xmath22 for the two photon polarizations are not independent ; they are related by effective field theory considerations @xcite as @xmath23 for @xmath24 .",
    "because of this relation , the photon dispersion relation can be expressed in terms of the single parameter @xmath25 which we denote as @xmath26 in the following .",
    "effective field theory predicts the relation @xmath27 between the liv parameters for fermions and anti - fermions for @xmath28 and @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , not necessary to introduce new parameters in the modified dispersion relation for positrons which can thus be written as @xmath30 thus , for the remainder of this paper we can restrict ourselves to the parameters @xmath31 , for which we simply write @xmath32 .    as a result ,",
    "liv modifications in the qed sector are described by three parameters at a given suppression by the power @xmath4 of the planck scale , namely by one for photons ( @xmath26 ) and two for electron and positron ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "note , however , that in some particular cases , kinematics is governed by just one parameter for the pair : if the final state of a certain process consists of an electron - positron pair with opposite helicity , due to the relation @xmath27 , only either @xmath35 or @xmath36 appears .",
    "if lorentz invariance is preserved , the main process influencing the propagation of uhe photons is pair production : photons with energy higher than @xmath37 produce an electron - positron pair interacting with low - energy background photons of energy @xmath38 .",
    "for interaction with cmb photons ( @xmath39 ev ) the lower threshold is @xmath40 ev , and the uhe photon flux is highly suppressed due to this interaction  @xcite .    if the dispersion relations for photons and fermions are modified by liv terms , then the lower threshold for this process can be modified and pair production can also become forbidden above a certain upper threshold",
    ". moreover , other processes , usually forbidden if lorentz invariance is preserved , can become allowed . in particular , photon decay ( @xmath41 ) and photon splitting ( @xmath42 ) can play an important role in the propagation of uhe photons . note that if pair production is forbidden above a certain upper threshold , than photon decay must also be forbidden : if the production of an electron positron pair is kinematically forbidden for two photons ( pair production ) , then it will be forbidden also for a single photon ( photon decay ) , otherwise pair production on an infinitely soft background photon would be allowed  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic timescale of these processes is relevant for their relative importance : in particular , for uhe photons the photon splitting timescale is usually larger than the propagation timescale  @xcite , therefore , in the following we will focus mainly on pair production and photon decay processes .    which and how many liv parameters are involved in pair production or in photon decay processes depends on the polarization of incoming photon(s ) and on the helicity of the outgoing electron and positron , see tab .

    "although right at the threshold , where the electron positron pair is produced without angular momentum , only the @xmath43-wave contributes to the process and certain helicity combinations are forbidden , above the threshold also higher partial waves contribute and all possible channels ( all partial waves ) must be considered .",
