    "numerical simulations of gluons on a space - time lattice provide at present the most reliable means of studying glueballs .",
    "glueball correlation functions are , however , notoriously difficult quantities to measure in monte carlo simulations : since the masses of these states are rather high and their creation operators have large vacuum fluctuations , the signal - to - noise ratio falls extremely rapidly as the separation between the source and sink is increased .",
    "because of this , reliable studies of glueballs on fine lattices have required prohibitively large computer resources .",
    "thus , the development of more efficient simulation techniques in lattice qcd is crucial to establishing a detailed description of glueballs and their interactions .",
    "the objective of this work is to examine the effectiveness of using an improved , anisotropic lattice action to reduce the computational effort needed to determine the glueball spectrum in quenched qcd .",
    "improved actions allow access to continuum physics on coarser lattices than possible using the simple wilson discretization .",
    "coarse lattice simulations are more efficient for several reasons : for a given physical volume , much fewer lattice sites are needed ; the alleviation of critical slowing down permits the faster generation of statistically independent gauge - field configurations ; glueball operator smearing is faster due to the decreased number of links and a decrease in the number of smearing iterations required ; glueball wavefunctions extend over much fewer lattice sites on a coarse lattice , making the variational technique far more effective when using a feasible number ( a dozen or so ) of basis operators .",
    "however , for glueball mass calculations , the coarseness of the temporal lattice spacing is a severe drawback .",
    "as the masses in lattice units of the states of interest are so large , the number of correlator time intervals which can be measured is reduced greatly @xcite .",
    "a straightforward solution to this problem which preserves the computational advantages of coarse lattices@xcite is to make use of anisotropic lattices in which the temporal spacing is much smaller than that in the spatial directions .",
    "this enables us to exploit the enhanced signal - to - noise of the correlation functions at smaller temporal separations . a natural scale for",
    "the temporal lattice spacing should be the inverse of the energy of the states of interest ; thus , for glueballs , a temporal cut - off larger than 1.5 gev allows resolution from accessible statistics of the correlator over a few time - slices .",
    "meanwhile , the scale for the spatial lattice should be set by the size of the wavefunction of the state ; a spatial grid separation in the range @xmath2 fm would seem reasonable .    since we propose to use lattices",
    "in which the temporal lattice spacing is small , improvement of the discretization in this direction is not needed .",
    "thus , a lattice action which couples only nearest - neighbor time - slices can be used .",
    "the transfer matrix corresponding to such an action is hermitian and positive definite ; all of our effective masses must converge to their plateau values monotonically from above .",
    "this ensures the validity of variational techniques which minimize the effective masses at small temporal separations .",
    "such techniques are very effective in diminishing the excited - state contributions to the glueball correlation functions and are crucial for efficient extraction of ground - state masses .    in this paper , we demonstrate the increased efficiency of glueball simulations using these actions on anisotropic lattices .",
    "we present results for the masses of three of the lighter su(3 ) glueball states , the scalar ( @xmath3 ) , the tensor ( @xmath0 ) , and the pseudovector ( @xmath1 ) . the masses of the first excited states in the scalar and tensor channels were also examined .",
    "ten simulations at lattice spacings ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 fm were performed , enabling reliable extrapolations to the continuum limit ( although the mass of the scalar glueball was somewhat problematic ) .",
    "the results are compared to previous simulation data obtained using the wilson action and we find that more accurate determinations of the tensor and pseudovector glueball masses have been achieved .",
    "a comparison of efficiencies is also made .",

    "this action , intended for use with @xmath28 , has @xmath29 discretization errors .",
    "the @xmath30 errors can be removed by the addition of counterterms which couple next - nearest - neighbor time - slices , but this introduces spurious high - energy modes which can cause considerable problems for our glueball simulations .",
    "these unphysical states appear in perturbation theory as additional poles in the gluon propagator .",
    "their detrimental effects on the glueball correlation functions have been previously demonstrated@xcite .",
    "although these spurious states do not affect the asymptotic behavior of the glueball correlators , they do appreciably change the correlators at short temporal separations and can seriously hinder attempts to reduce excited - state contamination to hasten the onset of asymptotic behavior .",
    "since our glueball mass measurements rely heavily on the reduction of such excited - state contributions to the glueball correlation functions , the use of an action which is free of spurious lattice modes is crucial .",
    "the action given in eq .",
    "[ eq : impaction ] couples only link variables on neighboring time - slices , which ensures that all of our effective masses converge to their plateau values monotonically from above and so validates the variational techniques employed .    it is now known that perturbation theory by itself does not reliably determine the couplings in an improved action in lattice gauge theory . hence , the interaction strengths in @xmath31 have been determined using a judicious combination of perturbation theory and mean field theory .",
    "mean field theory is introduced by separately renormalizing the spatial and temporal link variables : @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the renormalization factors for the spatial and temporal links , respectively .",
    "the mean - link parameters @xmath13 and @xmath12 are best determined by guessing input values for use in the action , measuring the mean links in landau gauge in a simulation , then readjusting the input values accordingly and tuning until the input values match the measured values .",
    "the determination of these renormalization factors is described in more detail in refs .",
    "however , when @xmath8 is significantly smaller than @xmath7 , we expect the mean temporal link @xmath13 to be very close to unity since @xmath34 in perturbation theory .",
    "hence , to simplify matters , we set @xmath35 . we introduce further simplifications by using a convenient and gauge - invariant definition for @xmath12 in terms of the mean spatial plaquette given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes the spatial plaquette .",
    "this eliminates the need for gauge fixing , yields values for @xmath12 which differ from those found using the landau gauge definition by only a few per cent , and significantly speeds up the tuning process .    at finite coupling @xmath11",
    ", the anisotropy @xmath38 is renormalized away from its input value @xmath6 .",
    "measurements of this renormalization have been made using the static potential extracted from correlations along the different spatial and temporal axes of the lattice @xcite . without mean - link improvement",
    ", this renormalization can be as large as @xmath39 .",
    "when the action includes mean - link corrections , this renormalization is found to be small , typically a few per cent .",
    "we used @xmath40 in all of our calculations , accepting the small radiative corrections to the anisotropy as finite lattice spacing errors , which vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "glueballs may be labeled by their total ( integral ) spin @xmath41 and their symmetries under spatial inversion and charge conjugation . however , on a cubic lattice , glueballs are characterized by their transformation properties under the cubic point group , combined with parity and charge conjugation operations .",
    "the cubic group , @xmath42 , has 24 elements that fall into five conjugacy classes , and thus , the dimensions of the irreducible representations ( irreps ) are 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 and 3 . these irreps are labeled @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively . including parity and charge conjugation symmetry operations ,",
    "there are 20 irreps ( labeled by @xmath48 , where @xmath41 now denotes an irrep of @xmath42 ) . in this study ,",
    "four of the irreps which generate light ( @xmath49 gev ) glueball states were simulated : the @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 channels . of particular interest are the @xmath51 and @xmath52 irreps whose combined five rows correspond to the five polarization states of the tensor ( @xmath0 ) glueball which become degenerate as continuum rotational invariance is restored .",
    "this then gives information on the magnitude of lattice artifacts at finite cut - off .",
    "the mass of a glueball , @xmath54 , having a given @xmath48 can be extracted from the large-@xmath55 behavior of a correlation function @xmath56 , where @xmath57 denotes the lattice irrep corresponding to the @xmath48 of interest and @xmath58 is a gauge - invariant , translationally - invariant , vacuum - subtracted operator capable of creating a glueball out of the qcd vacuum @xmath59 .",

    ", the correlator @xmath63 must be determined for @xmath55 sufficiently large that @xmath63 is well approximated by its asymptotic form .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise ratio in any monte carlo determination of @xmath63 falls exponentially fast with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , it is crucial to use a glueball operator for which @xmath63 attains its asymptotic form as quickly as possible .",
    "if @xmath64 denotes the glueball state of interest , this means that we must choose an operator for which the overlap @xmath65^{1/2}$ ] is as near to unity as possible .",
    "for such an operator , the signal - to - noise ratio is also optimal@xcite .    in order to construct such operators",
    ", we exploited the smearing @xcite and variational techniques which have been used with success in earlier wilson action simulations . in each of the @xmath48 channels of interest ,",
    "glueball operators were constructed on each time - slice in a sequence of three steps .",
    "first , smeared links @xmath66 and fuzzy superlinks @xmath67 were formed .",
    "secondly , a set of basic operators @xmath68 were constructed using linear combinations of gauge - invariant , path - ordered products of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 matrices about various closed spatial loops ; each such linear combination was designed to be invariant under spatial translations and to transform irreducibly under the symmetry operations of the cubic point group according to the irrep of interest .",
    "lastly , the glueball operators @xmath69 were formed from linear combinations of the basic operators , @xmath70 , where the coefficients @xmath71 were determined using the variational method . each of these three steps is described below .",
    "operators constructed out of smeared links and fuzzy superlinks have dramatically reduced mixings with the high frequency modes of the theory .",
    "thus , the use of spatially - smoothed links is an important part of reducing excited - state contamination in the glueball correlation functions .",
    "two smoothing procedures were used : a single - link procedure and a double - link procedure . in the single - link procedure , every spatial link @xmath72 on the lattice is replaced by itself plus a sum of its four neighboring ( spatial ) staples , projected back into su(3 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the projection @xcite into su(3 ) . here , we denote this mapping of the spatial link matrices into the smeared link variables by @xmath75 . in the double - link procedure , new superlinks @xmath76 of length @xmath77",
    "are built using neighboring staples which connect sites separated by a distance twice that of the length of the source link variables : @xmath78 and we denote this mapping by @xmath79 .",
    "both procedures can be applied recursively ; smeared links can be smeared again and fuzzy links of increasing length @xmath80 can be constructed .",
    "a _ smoothing scheme _",
    ", @xmath81 , is defined as a composition of single - link mappings and double - link mappings .",

    "only one iteration of the fuzzing procedure which results in links connecting sites separated by @xmath77 was found to be useful for the range of coarse @xmath7 values explored here .",
    "for the finer lattices ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) , an extra four initial iterations of single - link smearing were used in all six smoothing schemes to enhance ground - state overlap . to simplify matters , the same values for the two parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "were used in all smearing and fuzzing iterations .",
    "these values were chosen to minimize excited - state contamination in the glueball correlation functions .",
    "a crude optimization was done in a set of low statistics runs and the optimal values @xmath93 and @xmath94 were then used in all the glueball simulations .",
    "the second step in the construction of our glueball operators was the formation of a set of basic operators @xmath68 using linear combinations of gauge - invariant , path - ordered products of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 matrices about various closed spatial loops .",
