    "it is well known that qnms possess discrete spectra of complex characteristic frequencies which are entirely fixed by the structure of the background spacetime and irrelevant of the initial perturbations@xcite @xcite .",
    "thus , it is believed that one can directly identify the existence of a black hole by comparing qnms with the gravitational waves observed in the universe , as well as test the stability of the event horizon against small perturbations .",
    "meanwhile , it is generally believed that the study of qnms may lead to a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic properties of black holes in loop quantum gravity @xcite @xcite since the real part of quasinormal frequencies with a large imaginary part for the scalar field in the schwarzschild black hole is equal to the barbero - immirzi parameter @xcite , a factor introduced by hand in order that the loop quantum gravity reproduces correct entropy of the black hole .",
    "it was also argued that the qnms of anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes have a direct interpretation in terms of the dual conformal field theory ( cft ) @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , a large static black hole in asymptotically ads spacetime corresponds to a ( approximately ) thermal state in cft , and the decay of the test field in the black - hole spacetime corresponds to the decay of the perturbed state in cft .",
    "the dynamical timescale for the return to the thermal equilibrium can be done in the ads spacetime , and then translated into the cft using the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "thus , qnms for various black holes have been studied extensively @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although many authors studied the qnms of scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations , the investigation of the dirac qnms is very limited @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in these papers the study of the dirac qnms was limited to use pshl - teller potential or wkb approximative methods .",
    "the pshl - teller potential approximative may be a valuable tool in certain situations , but in general results obtained from the approximating potentials should not be expected to be accurate .",
    "the wkb method can be generalized to deal with the reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes . in the latter case ,",
    "unfortunately , the method is not very simple to apply and does not yield very accurate results .",
    "it is well known that the leaver s continued fraction technique is the best workhorse method to compute highly damped modes and is very reliable .",
    "however , the method can not be directly used to study the qnms of the dirac fields if we take the standard wave equations .",
    "the reason to obstruct the study of the dirac qnms using continued fraction technique is that for static black holes the standard wave equation @xmath1 possesses a special potential @xmath2 which is the function of @xmath3 @xcite@xcite@xcite , where @xmath4 is a function related to the metric of the spacetimes , say @xmath5 for the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we can not investigate the dirac qnms using the continued fraction approaches because we have to expand the potential as a series at the event horizon but the factor @xmath3 does not permit us to do that .",
    "recently , we @xcite found that the wave function and the potential of the dirac fields can be expressed as new forms .",
    "starting from the new wave function and potential , we @xcite studied the dirac qnms of the schwarzschild black hole using the continued fraction @xcite and hill - determinant approaches @xcite@xcite and the dirac qnms of the schwarzschild - anti - de sitter and reissner - nordstrm - anti - de sitter black holes using horowitz - hubeny approach @xcite . the main purpose of this paper is to extend the investigation to the kerr - newman black hole because this black hole is the only asymptotically flat electro - vacuum solution of the einstein - maxwell system @xcite and it is the most general black hole among classical black holes .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the decoupled dirac equations and corresponding wave equations in the kerr - newman spacetime are obtained using newman - penrose formalism . in sec .",
    "3 the angular and radial continued fraction equations are introduced . in sec .",
    "4 the numerical results for the dirac qnms in the reissner - nordstrm , kerr and kerr - newman black holes are presented .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary .",

    "the kerr - newman metric reduces to the rotating kerr metric , and as @xmath21 it reduces to the charged reissner - nordstrm metric .",

    "the expansion coefficients of the wave equation which satisfy appropriate boundary conditions are directly determined by a three - term recurrence relation .",
    "then , the dirac quasinormal frequencies of the kerr - newman black hole are evaluated using continued fraction approach and the results are presented by tables and figures . by comparing the results of the reissner - nordstrm and kerr black holes , it is interesting to note that the real part of the quasinormal frequencies of the reissner - nordstrm black hole is greater than that of the kerr black hole , but the imaginary part is less than that of the kerr black hole if we take the same values of the charge and the angular momentum per unit mass . that is to say , the decay of the dirac fields in the charged black - hole spacetime is faster than that in the rotating black - hole spacetime if the values of the charge and angular momentum per unit mass are the same . from figures we find that the frequencies in the complex @xmath0 plane generally move counterclockwise as the charge or the angular momentum per unit mass increases .",

    "we also find that the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal frequencies are oscillatory functions of the angular momentum per unit mass , and the oscillating behavior starts earlier and earlier as the overtone number grows for a fixed @xmath94 ( or as the charge @xmath17 increases for fixed @xmath68 and @xmath94 ) , but it begins later and later as @xmath94 increases for a fixed overtone number .",
