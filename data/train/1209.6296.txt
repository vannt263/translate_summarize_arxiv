    "the casimir effect is a manifestation of the quantum vacuum fluctuations that can be tested at mesoscopic scales .",
    "this quantum phenomenon has been of interest to fundamental physics since its prediction by casimir in 1948  @xcite , and it has been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally since then ( for some recent reviews on both theory and experiments , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "in particular , many experiments have been measuring the casimir force with increasing precision .",
    "it is then of increasing interest to look for possible novel situations where the theoretically computed casimir force can be confronted to experiments and where related quantum phenomena , associated with the quantum vacuum , can then be probed and tested in the laboratory .    in this work , we want to study how a vacuum state made of topological excitations , more precisely , a vacuum constituted of condensed vortices , will affect the casimir force between perfectly conducting parallel lines in a plane .",
    "let us recall that stable vortex configurations can appear in important condensed matter systems , like in high - temperature superconductors and superfluids ( for a detailed presentation , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein )",
    ". there has being an increasing use of superconducting materials to study the casimir effect ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that unusual behaviors of superconductors may be found when the sizes of the samples shrink .",
    "but we note that this is precisely the case , at the nanometer scales , that we expect that the casimir force to become more appreciable . in the case of vortex - based superconducting detectors",
    "@xcite , for instance , it can be expected that the casimir effect can possibly alter the microscopic parameters of the detector , analogously to the case reported in ref .",
    "since superconductors can naturally form condensed phases of vortices , it becomes a matter of interest to investigate how a vacuum state constituted of a condensate of vortex excitations would affect the casimir force .",
    "a vortex condensed phase constitutes a particular example of a nontrivial vacuum state . the casimir effect being a manifestation of the quantum vacuum , it is then a fundamental problem to investigate how a vacuum state with topological excitations can affect the casimir force .",
    "the simplest and , in our opinion , the most direct way for studying a vortex condensate state is through the use of dual transformations involving the field variables of the original lagrangian density . by following this procedure",
    ", we can make explicit the system s topological excitations content . in the problem that we study in this work",
    ", these topological excitations will be vortex ones .",
    "the duality transformations are reminiscent of similar approaches first used in condensed matter studies performed on the lattice  @xcite and of routine use since then . through a series of appropriate dual transformations involving the original fields in the functional action ,",
    "an equivalent action is obtained , in which the vortex excitations are made explicit . by properly matching our dual action to a field theory model , it is then possible to write it in terms of a vortex field coupled to a vectorial field ( for earlier implementations of this procedure , see for example , the work done in refs .",
    "@xcite , and references therein ) .    here",
    "we investigate the casimir force for a massive vectorial field in a maxwell - proca - chern - simons ( mpcs ) model . following the work in refs .",
    "@xcite , we show that this model can be seen as the dualized version of a chern - simons - higgs ( csh ) model , in which the vortex excitations of the csh model are made explicit and considered in a vacuum state .",
    "vortex condensation in chern - simons ( cs ) type theories , particularly in self - dual models , have been shown possible for some critical value of the chern - simons parameter  @xcite , with the determination of the condensation point explicitly obtained in @xcite .",
    "the casimir force for the dual mpcs type of model is studied here in this context , deep inside the vortex condensate phase .",
    "irrespective of the connection of the dual mpcs model with the csh model , the study done in this work has an interest of its own , which is associated with the determination of the casimir force for massive vectorial fields .",
    "recall that the mpcs model represents , by itself , massive photons in 2 + 1 dimensions , with the photon mass having contributions from the usual proca and the cs terms .",
    "while the mass contribution coming from the proca term can be seen as having been generated through a symmetry breaking scalar field term , the contribution from the chern - simons term is of purely topological origin  @xcite .",
    "the issue of the casimir force for a vectorial field is closely related to important questions , from both experimental and theoretical points of views .",
    "for instance , in the case of 3 + 1 dimensions , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the existence of new expressions for the electromagnetic field between conducting plates , where the photon has a possibly non - null mass .",
    "they then study the dependence of the casimir force with the photon mass .",
    "later , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the proca equations were used to represent the photon mass . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was considered the mass acquired by the photon due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking that takes place when a superconducting detector passes from its normal ( n ) to the superconducting ( s ) state , as a consequence of the detection of an external photon . in that reference , it was argued that the casimir effect can alter the s - n transition in a detectable way and to be able to alter the microscopic parameters of the detector .",
    "also considered in @xcite was the viability of describing the casimir force when the corresponding maxwell equations are replaced by the proca ones for massive photons .",
    "the casimir force between perfectly conducting parallel lines in a plane for a mcs model has been determined previously in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it has already been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the casimir force obtained in the mcs model is identical to that derived from a massive noninteracting scalar field in 2 + 1 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this result can be understood from the fact that in both theories the field satisfies the klein - gordon equation of motion and both have only 1 degree of freedom .",
    "note that , in this case , the chern - simons term provides a mass term for the gauge field , but this is a topological mass that still maintains the field with only one ( transverse ) polarization degree of freedom .",
    "besides , the boundary conditions ( bcs ) in both models can be matched , making the casimir force in both models to agree . on the other hand , in a symmetry - broken case ,",
    "a proca mass term is generated for the gauge field , which acquires a longitudinal polarization degree of freedom , in addition to the transverse polarization .",
    "for the case of the mpcs theory , the gauge field now has two polarization degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly to the case of the mcs theory , we now expect that the respective casimir force could be related to _ two _ massive noninteracting scalar fields .",
    "in fact , it is well known that in this case the quantum mechanical analogue of the mpcs theory is equivalent to two noninteracting harmonic oscillators with distinct frequencies  @xcite . at the quantum field theory level",
    ", this fact must then correspond to the case of two noninteracting massive scalar fields .",
    "this has been shown explicitly in  @xcite , where a mapping between the two theories was constructed .",
    "however , in order to associate the corresponding casimir forces for both theories , a careful consideration of the boundary conditions must be accounted for .",
    "this issue was earlier discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we will give a detailed account for the issue of the boundary conditions when mapping our dual mpcs theory with vortices with a model corresponding to two noninteracting massive scalar fields .",
    "this will allow us then to readily obtain the casimir force for the model we are studying here .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this justifies neglecting those contributions to the partition function , as we have assumed .",

    "( [ actione ] ) , which are the mass for the gauge field @xmath1 in the broken phase , @xmath178 , and the mass for the scalar field @xmath0 , @xmath179 .",
    "these masses can be related to the relevant scales in the context of superconductivity .",
    "the two naturally occurring length scales in the theory of superconductivity are the penetration depth , @xmath180 , which describes the typical length into which a magnetic field can penetrate into a superconductor and the coherence length , @xmath181 , which describes the length scale at which the order parameter varies in space .",

    "( [ fraction ] ) the result @xmath196 , representing already a casimir force that is @xmath197 smaller due the presence of a vortex condensate . for larger values of @xmath198 , or equivalently for @xmath199",
    ", we need to solve numerically for the integral in eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) , with the corresponding casimir force decreasing exponentially due to the characteristic second debye function displayed by the casimir force for a massive scalar particle eq .",
    "( [ fs ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the casimir force eq .",
    "( [ fvortex ] ) as a function of arbitrary values for the vortex condensate .",
    "the overall decrease of the casimir force when in the presence of a vacuum state with vortices can be interpreted as follows .",
    "vortices are expected to repel each other , much like as in the standard mean - field phenomenology for type - ii superconductors when vortices can form  @xcite , e.g. in the shubnikov phase , where above some critical magnetic field vortices are present .",
    "the repelling vortices will exert an opposite , repulsive force on the external conducting lines that tend to counterbalance the attractive casimir force , tending to make it smaller the larger the vev of the vortex condensate is .",
    "the resulting casimir force can then be made sufficiently small in the presence of vortex matter , though it will never be exactly zero or become repulsive , as it can be clear from the expression for the casimir force and from eq .",
    "( [ m12 ] ) , where of course @xmath200 .",
    "we have studied in this work how a nontrivial vacuum state , with condensed vortex excitations , affects the casimir force between two conducting lines in a plane . by starting from a csh model with field equations having vortex solutions , and using its dualized form , which results to be a mcsh model , vortex degrees of freedom",
    "are made explicit . in the vortex condensation regime of the dual model ,",
    "it can be expressed simply as a mpcs theory , which in turn can be mapped in a two noninteracting massive scalar field model . using the known expression for the casimir force for a massive scalar field ,",
    "the corresponding casimir forces for the case of vortex matter between the two lines have been computed .",
    "we have shown that the casimir force in the presence of vortex matter is smaller than in the absence of vortices .",
    "this result may have implications for casimir effect experiments using e.g. superconductors , like in the next generation of experiments  @xcite , in the case that type - ii superconductors could eventually be used .",
    "the results we have obtained are indicative that the presence of vortices in the superconducting materials can make the casimir effect much smaller , making its detection through measurements more difficult .",
    "earlier experiments on the casimir effect performed by using superconducting materials , e.g. in @xcite , investigated the variation of the casimir energy in the transition from the normal to the superconducting state . though this variation can be very small , it can have a magnitude comparable to the condensation energy of a semiconducting film .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that this can cause a measurable increase in the value of the critical magnetic field required for the transition .",
    "however , these experiments were performed by using type - i superconductors , where a vortex state is absent .",
    "it is feasible to expect , based on the results we have obtained here , that in the case of type - ii superconductors , there should also be observed another variation of the casimir energy in the transition from the superconducting state to the shubnikov phase , where vortices are formed .",
    "another important issue that must be cited is the possibility of using our results to find the casimir force , for the mpcs theory , in the case of moving boundaries ( _ i.e. _ , the dynamical casimir effect ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , it is expected that the casimir energy plays an important role in superconductors , especially at the nanometer scale .",
    "recently , the first experimental observation of the dynamical casimir effect in a superconductor circuit @xcite has brought great attention to this matter .",
    "some of the considerations that we have done here are also valid in the dynamical case . of course , where we set the boundaries ( e.g. @xmath201 and @xmath105 ) is of decisive importance for determining the expression for the casimir force . however , the mapping between the initial mpcs theory and the model of the scalar fields makes use only of the values of the derivatives of the functions @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath57 at the boundaries .",
    "but the value of @xmath145 itself at those boundaries is never actually needed there at any step . in other words ,",
    "the mapping used here is expected also to be valid in the case of moving boundaries , as long as the bcs remain valid ( e.g. , a perfect conductor parallel to the @xmath148 axis , in a movement in the @xmath145 direction ) .",
    "hence we conclude that we can use the same arguments used here to study the dynamical casimir effect for the mpcs model .",
    "however , to find the casimir force in that case , we must know the force for a massive scalar field between moving boundaries , which is an issue that we intend to treat in a future work .",
    "the casimir force for the dual theory is expressed , as usual , in terms of the vev of the @xmath202 component of the symmetrized energy - momentum tensor  @xcite : @xmath203 .",
    "thus , we can first write      where , for the sake of simplicity , we made use of the definition of the dual tensor @xmath136 , @xmath205 usually , the components @xmath136 are associated to the components of the `` electric '' and  magnetic \" fields ( @xmath206 , @xmath207 and the scalar @xmath208 ) . in this work ,",
    "@xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath101 may or may not ( in the case of the dual gauge field ) represent a physical massive electromagnetic field ( we are just borrowing an usual nomenclature ) . hence , @xmath211 at the boundaries can be written in terms of vevs of products like @xmath212 and derivatives of them , taken at @xmath104 or @xmath105 ( the explicit values of @xmath145 at the boundaries will not be necessary for our purposes ) .",
    "following @xcite , we write those vevs , at @xmath213 , as       where @xmath145 and @xmath215 stand for points in the three - dimensional space - time . but the vevs in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ amuanupropagators ] ) are the two - point functions of the model , which can be written in terms of the functional derivatives of the normalized generating functional @xmath216 $ ] , where @xmath217 is a source :    @xmath218}{\\delta j_{\\mu}(x)\\ \\delta j_{\\nu}(x ' ) } \\right|_{j_{\\alpha } = 0 } =   -\\frac{\\delta^2}{\\delta j_{\\mu}(x)\\ \\delta    j_{\\nu}(x')}\\left [ \\frac{\\int { \\cal d}a_{\\beta } \\exp \\left (   is +      i\\int j_{\\alpha}a^{\\alpha } \\right ) } { \\int { \\cal d}a_{\\gamma } \\exp      ( is ) }    \\right]_{j_{\\alpha } = 0}.\\ ] ]    the derivatives appearing in eq .",
    "( [ derivativesofzdej ] ) are independent of the norm of the field .",
    "this also shows that the casimir force should also be independent of the normalization of the fields .",
    "for instance , the arbitrary mass parameter @xmath29 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ s_ini ] ) can be put as a global multiplicative constant @xmath219 in all terms in eq .",
