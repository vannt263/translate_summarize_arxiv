    "the distributions of mesons at large transverse momenta in @xmath4 or @xmath5 collisions are usually calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd using collinear factorization ( see e.g. @xcite ) in order to extend the calculation towards lower values of meson transverse momenta it was suggested to add an extra gaussian distribution in transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear that this procedure is effective in the following sense .",
    "the transverse momentum originates either from the nonperturbative `` really internal '' momentum distributions of partons in nucleons ( of the order of a fraction of gev ) and/or is generate dynamically as the inital state radiation process ( of the order of gev ) . in principle , the second component depends on the value of longitudinal momentum fraction .",
    "recently kwieciski and collaborators @xcite have shown how to solve the so - called ccfm equations by introducing updf s in the space conjugated to the transverse momenta . in the following",
    "we shall use those updf s for pion production at sps , isr and rhic energies .",
    "the approach proposed by kwieciski is very convenient to introduce the nonperturbative effects like internal ( nonperturbative ) transverse momentum distributions of partons in nucleons .",
    "it seems reasonable , at least in the first approximation , to include the nonperturbative effects in the factorizable way @xmath6 in the following , for simplicity , we use a flavour and @xmath7-independent form factor @xmath8 within @xmath9-factorization approach there are three basic diagrams for inclusive parton production shown in fig.[fig : diagrams ] .     , title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   , title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]   , title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]    the formulae for inclusive parton production , after some minor approximation @xcite , can be written in the equivalent and compact way in the so - called impact parameter space + for diagram a : @xmath10 for diagram b@xmath11 : @xmath12 for diagram b@xmath13 : @xmath14 the kretzer ffs ( see e.g.@xcite ) are used to convert partons to hadrons .",
    "details of the hadronization procedure are explained in @xcite .",
    "in fig.[fig : pions_pt ] we compare our model invariant cross sections for @xmath15 ( left panel ) and @xmath16 ( right panel ) as a function of pion transverse momentum at w = 27.4 gev for different values of the parameter @xmath17 in eq.([formfactor ] ) . in principle , our result should not exceed experimental data especially in the perturbative regime of @xmath18 2 gev where the perturbative @xmath19 parton subprocesses are crucial .",

    "while at large ( pseudo)rapidities ( @xmath23 = 2.2 , 3.2 ) our results ( negative pions ) are quite compatible with the brahms data for negative hadrons , there seems to be a missing strength at more central ( pseudo)rapidities ( @xmath23 = 0.0 , 1.0 ) , i.e. in the case when the sum of positively and negatively charged hadrons is measured .",

    "inclusive distributions in transverse momentum of pions for both sps and rhic energies have been shown here for illustration . a rather good agreement with experimental data",
    "is obtained without introducing so - called k - factors and/or initial ( internal ) transverse momenta by hand . in our approach transverse momentum",
    "is generated to large extent perturbatively by solving coupled equations for updf s .",
    "therefore , in contrast to the standard collinear approach , in our approach the range of applicability can be extended towards much lower transverse momenta ."
