    "the heating and the acceleration of the solar wind multi - ion plasma is still a poorly understood phenomenon , despite the fact that it has been studied extensively for decades by satellite observations and theoretical models . in situ and remote sensing observations at 0.29 au and beyond by helios and ulysses spacecraft have found non - thermal features in the ion velocity distributions ( i.e. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "for instance , proton distributions often appeared double - peaked , he@xmath0 ions drift at the local alfvn speed relative to protons , and heavy ions usually appear hotter and flow faster than protons in the fast solar wind streams",

    "from pure adiabatic expansion of the solar wind plasma one would expect that @xmath1 due to the conservation of magnetic moment of the expanding ions in a decreasing radial magnetic field .",
    "however , remote sensing close to the sun and in - situ observations at @xmath2 au of fast solar wind * reveal that for ions @xmath3*. this anisotropy has been attributed as indirect evidence for the presence of ion - cyclotron waves , as it has been suggested that resonant absorption of ion cyclotron waves heats and accelerates the ions in the solar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "measurements of the magnetic spectrum fluctuations provide further clues to the turbulence and dissipation processes involved in the solar wind plasma heating .",
    "for instance , observations of alfvnic fluctuations in the solar wind by helios , ulysses , ace , and wind spacecraft show that the fluctuations follow power laws of @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the frequency in spacecraft frame ) at very low frequencies , @xmath6 suggestive of kolmogorov turbulence in the inertia range , and steeper slopes in the dissipation range near proton gyroresonant frequency . the solar probe plus mission , currently under development by nasa ,",
    "is scheduled to launch in 2018 , and will measure the solar wind properties as close as 9.5 r@xmath7 from the sun ( where @xmath8 is the solar radius @xmath9 m ) . in this region",
    "the solar wind plasma is still accelerating and it is expected to be inhomogeneous due to the cross - field density and velocity structures of the corona . the effect of plasma inhomogeneity is considered in the present study .",
    "previous work by @xcite on homogeneous plasma heating with a 2d hybrid model shows that non linear effects are important in the heating of the homogenous plasma early in the simulation .",
    "they find that a driven alfvn broadband spectrum causes perpendicular heating of heavy ions .",
    "however , they conclude that oblique waves do not play an important role in the heating of homogenous plasma .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the heating of expanding homogenous solar wind plasma with a two - dimensional hybrid model .",
    "they find that the solar wind expansion has little effect on the preferential ion heating but that it leads to faster evolution of magnetosonic drift instability .",
    "several 2d hybrid models of homogeneous solar wind plasma heating by a spectrum of ion cyclotron waves * include studies * by @xcite .",
    "previous works that study the effect of the expansion on homogeneous solar wind plasma heated by ion - cyclotron waves with 1d and 2d hybrid models include @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "work by @xcite and @xcite investigate with a 2d hybrid model the effects of a turbulent spectrum on the heating of solar wind plasma in an inhomogenous density background .",
    "they find that he@xmath0 ions are heated more efficiently by the alfvnic wave spectrum below the proton gyroperiod compared to the homogeneous background solar wind . in this work",
    "we extend their study to an expanding - box 2.5d hybrid model .",
    "we explore the effect of sub- and super - alfvnic ion relative drifts as well as a turbulent source spectrum on the perpendicular heavy - ion heating in an inhomogeneous plasma with various degrees of cross - field density gradient .",
    "we investigate the collisionless heating processes in the expanding solar wind using plasma parameters appropriate close to the sun ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we find that the inhomogeneity in the plasma generates oblique waves due to refraction of an initially parallel wave spectrum , which contribute to the heating of the solar wind plasma , while left - hand polarized parallel propagating waves still play the main role in the perpendicular ion heating .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model : sec ] we present the details of our numerical hybrid model , in section  [ num_res : sec ] we show the numerical results , and section  [ conc : sec ] is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "for our calculations we use a 2.5d hybrid model initially developed by @xcite , adapted for 2d modeling of waves and beam heating of solar wind plasma by @xcite and later parallelized by @xcite .",
    "the hybrid model allows the study of ion dynamics by treating the ions kinetically using the particle - in - cell ( pic ) technique in a two - dimensional spatial domain ( allowing parallel and obliquely propagating waves ) , while considering the electrons as a charge - neutralizing background fluid .",
    "in addition , the model follows the three components of the particle velocity and of the electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we use a cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath11-direction along the uniform background magnetic field @xmath12 and assume periodic boundary conditions in @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "the simulations follow more than @xmath14 particles , which are initialized as 127 particles / cell / species in a 2d spatial grid of 128 by 256 computational cells .",

    "the size of the modeled grid has units of 1.5@xmath15 in the @xmath11-direction , and 0.75@xmath15 in the @xmath13-direction , where @xmath16 is the proton inertia length and @xmath17 is the plasma frequency of the protons .",
    "the inhomogeneity across the field is well resolved , and the wavenumber range in the model covers the low frequency ( non - resonant ) part of the dispersion relation as well as waves in the dissipation range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work we study the effect of an inhomogenous proton and he@xmath0 background density on the dissipation of alfvnic fluctuations in the solar wind plasma ( the electron density is determined by the quasi - neutrality condition @xmath18 .",

    "@xmath22 is the amplitude of the inhomogeneity , which is taken to be @xmath23 in this study ( @xcite performed a parametric study of @xmath22 in the range 0  4 and of other parameters in non - expanding solar wind plasma , where @xmath24 represents homogeneous background ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath25 is the power that determines the sharpness of the transition between low and high density regions , and @xmath26 gives the width of the high - density region .",
    "note that the inhomogeneity does not introduce a net current in this model due to the massless treatment of the electrons .",

    "we divide the sharp inhomogeneity case into three distinct regions : an external homogeneous region ( region a in figure [ initial_density]b ) , an inhomogenous region ( shaded region b in figure [ initial_density]b ) , and an internal homogenous region ( region c in figure [ initial_density]b ) .    in anticipation of the solar probe plus mission observations close to the sun",
    "we choose our modeling parameters to represent the solar wind conditions at @xmath10 .",

    "as part of this study we investigate the effect of the expansion of the solar wind plasma on the temperature anisotropies and velocity distribution functions . the expansion model used",
    "was initially proposed for mhd equations by @xcite and was later implemented to hybrid 1d and 2d models @xcite .",
    "our version of the model has been implemented in previous studies of solar wind expansion in 1d hybrid modeling with two ion species @xcite and in a 2d hybrid model of homogenous h@xmath34 ",
    "he@xmath0 solar wind plasma @xcite . for this study",
    "we employ the same 2d expanding box model used previously , but include instead an inhomogeneous background plasma with density gradient across the background magnetic field direction . in brief , the expanding model can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the model assumes radial expansion of the solar wind at a distance @xmath35 from the sun with a constant bulk velocity @xmath36 .",
    "the equations of motion and the fields are modified by a dimensionless expansion factor @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the expansion parameter and the @xmath39 is in units of @xmath40 , such that @xmath41 and higher order terms of @xmath42 are neglected . in our model we choose @xmath43 , due to computational limitations , compared to a real solar value @xmath44 near 10@xmath45 .",
    "the background field and the corresponding ion - cyclotron frequency decrease as 1/@xmath46 .",
    "the coordinate system is transformed , such that the @xmath11-direction undergoes galilean transformation and the @xmath13- and @xmath47- coordinates undergo stretching with time .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , * @xcite , @xcite , * @xcite and @xcite for further details on the expanding box model and its implementation .",
    "we divide our study in two parts : in the first part , we model the effect of the expansion in the inhomogeneous solar wind plasma and include an initial beam of proton - he@xmath0 drift with a super- or sub - alfvnic relative drift velocity . in the second part ,",
    "we include a turbulent spectrum of driven circularly polarized alfvnic / cyclotron waves in addition to the initially drifting ion beam . in each of these setups the super - alfvnic drift and/or",
    "the spectrum provide sources of free energy * leading to ion - cyclotron waves * and self - consistent secondary wave spectrum .",
    "we calculate the waves impact on the ion heating and on the temperature anisotropy in the model .",
    "we list the initial parameters of the simulations for all cases chosen in this study in table [ par_table ] .      in this section",
    "we apply a beam of he@xmath0 ions with an initial drift with respect to the protons .",
    "first , we analyze the effect of a sub - alfvnic ion drift @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the alfvn speed .",
    "we employ different expansion factors : @xmath50 ( no expansion ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 demonstrating the effects of slow and moderate expansions ( cases 1 and 2 ) .",
    "figure  [ subalfv_gauss ] shows the calculated temporal evolution of the temperature anisotropies for the gaussian and sharp inhomogeneity cases respectively . without the expansion",
    "there is a slight increase ( @xmath53 ) in the ion anisotropy and a comparable decrease in the proton anisotropy by the end of the run .",
    "* this increase in the ion anisotropy is likely due to numerical heating , which is controlled in the code by looking at particle energy conservation .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for further reading on particle energy testing in pic and hybrid codes , respectively .",
    "our diagnostic confirmed that the particle energy is conserved reasonably well ( typically within 5% ) throughout the run .",
    "* when the expansion factor is small ( @xmath54 ) the ion temperature anisotropy remains constant and the proton temperature anisotropy decreases about @xmath55 .",
    "however , once moderate expansion is included ( @xmath56 ) the temperature anisotropy of protons and he@xmath0 ions decreases quickly with time by 35% and 40% at the end of the run , respectively .",
    "this is due to the stretching of the perpendicular coordinates and the corresponding decrease of the ions perpendicular velocities that translates to cooler perpendicular vdfs of the ions .",
    "the ion drift in the parallel direction remains constant throughout the simulation and the sharpness of the background inhomogeneity does not have a significant effect on the evolution of the temperature anisotropy in this case .    for comparison , we repeat the calculations using an initially super - alfnic ion drift with @xmath57 ( cases 3 and 4 ) .",
    "super - alfnic drifts are unstable to ion cyclotron instability leading to perpendicular ion heating @xcite .",
    "figures [ superalfv_gauss ] and [ superalfv_sharp ] show our results for the gaussian and sharp inhomogeneities . *",
    "the initial drift drives a magnetosonic instability that leads to a fast increase in the he@xmath0 ion temperature anisotropy reaching a peak of @xmath58 in about @xmath59 for all expanding cases and both inhomogeneity sharpness cases .",
    "once the peak is reached , the anisotropy decreases quickly as the he@xmath0 emit ion - cyclotron waves due to their own ion - cyclotron instability , as well as due to some gradual parallel heating ( see figure [ energies_exp_comp ] ) .",
    "consequently , the ion drift relaxes due to the energy lost by the emission of the waves and the protons are heated rapidly in the perpendicular direction due to resonance . *",
    "the proton temperature anisotropy grows reaching 1.5 in the gaussian inhomogeneity case and @xmath60 in the sharp inhomogeneity case within @xmath61 .",
    "parallel heating also takes place by velocity space diffusion , as evident in figure  [ energies_exp_comp ] . when the expansion is taken into account , initially there is a drop in the proton temperature anisotropy due to the perpendicular cooling effect from the expansion , which then increases to slightly lower maximum values of the temperature anisotropies at a later time , compared to the non - expanding case . at the end of the run the proton temperature anisotropy for the gaussian case has not reached equilibrium yet and continues to increase . similar increase in the anisotropy",
    "is also seen for cases with a homogeneous plasma density background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or when the inhomogeneity gradient across the field is moderate like in the gaussian inhomogeneity case .    for the sharp inhomogeneity case ( @xmath27 ) the temperature anisotropy reaches an equilibrium",
    "faster compared to the @xmath28 case as long as the expansion is kept at a slow rate . for the moderate expansion case shown ( @xmath56 ) the proton temperature anisotropy is still increasing at the end of the simulation .",
    "the ion drift is also affected by the expansion , which causes a faster decrease to lower velocity values .",
    "figures [ superalfv_gauss ] and [ superalfv_sharp ] also show a small peak in the ion drift , which correlates with a peak in the ion temperature anisotropy .",
    "this effect is caused by an increase in the parallel velocity of the protons , when the peak perpendicular heating is reached .",
    "the heating of the protons in the parallel direction then causes a @xmath62 5  7% increase in the drift , which in turn heats the ions and increases the anisotropy momentarily by 20% .",
    "the ion temperature anisotropy reaches an asymptotic value slightly larger than 1 , while the protons continue to heat in the perpendicular direction , unless inhibited by a large expansion coefficient .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ energies_exp_comp ] that the slow solar wind expansion rate has little or no effect on the particle energies , while a moderate expansion rate has an increasing effect in the perpendicular component of the ions and a slight decreasing effect on the perpendicular energy of the protons .",
    "these results are in agreement with the previous studies of magnetosonic drift instability in inhomogeneous background solar wind plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the expansion appears to mostly affect the proton temperature anisotropy ( since the protons are not heated significantly by the instability ) and speeds up the decrease of the relative he@xmath0-proton drift .",
    "figures [ vspacegauss]a , [ vspacegauss]b , and [ yz - phasespace ] show the @xmath63 ",
    "@xmath64 plane of the velocity phase - space for protons and he@xmath0 ions for the super - alfvnic drift case with gradual expansion ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "figure  [ vspacegauss ] conveys the results for the gaussian background inhomogeneity ( case 3b ) .",
    "below each phase - space plot we show the velocity distribution in @xmath64 at @xmath65 with the corresponding best - fit maxwellian distribution over - plotted with the dotted curve .",
    "the results show the proton distribution close to equilibrium at the end of the simulation ( see figure [ vspacegauss]a ) . on the other hand , the he@xmath0 ions perpendicular velocity distribution deviates from a maxwellian in the core of the distribution . *",
    "this deviation effect is due to the drift instability , which affects the ions , and has been also observed in models without the inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "although the distribution is isotropic in the perpendicular velocity phase space , at the tails it decreases faster than the best - fit maxwellian distribution*. figure  [ yz - phasespace ] shows the results for a sharp background inhomogeneity ( case 4b ) . in the sharp inhomogeneity case",
    "we calculate and compare the velocity distribution in the three distinct regions as explained above : an inhomogenous region ( shaded region b in figure [ initial_density]b ) , an internal homogenous region ( region c in figure [ initial_density]b ) , and an external homogeneous region ( region a in figure [ initial_density]b ) .",
    "the proton distribution for all three regions ( not shown ) follows a maxwellian distribution closely , as was shown previously in the gaussian inhomogeneity case .",
    "the he@xmath0 ion distributions in all three regions are circularly symmetric in the perpendicular plane .",
    "however , the distribution * only follows a maxwellian at the core and the tails of the distribution decrease at different rates in each of the regions*. this effect may be attributed to the background inhomogeneity , as it is not seen in the results shown by @xcite , which analyzes a homogeneous solar wind plasma case with similar parameters . at the tails the distribution falls faster than the maxwellian in all there regions , similarly to the gaussian inhomogeneity case .",
    "figures [ vspacegauss]c , [ vspacegauss]d , and [ xz - phasespace ] show the @xmath66 @xmath64 plane of the phase - space velocity distribution for both background inhomogeneity cases .",
    "figure  [ vspacegauss]c demonstrates the preferential perpendicular heating of the protons , although the difference with the best - fit maxwellian distribution is not pronounced . from figure  [ vspacegauss]d and figure  [ xz - phasespace ]",
    "it is clear that the velocity distributions for the he@xmath0 ions is distinctly non - maxwellian regardless of the shape of the inhomogeneity .",
    "moreover , the sharper inhomogeneity leads to a narrower beam - like vdfs for the ions .",
    "in fact , even the homogenous regions of the sharp inhomogeneity case exhibit a clear preferential heating .",
    "the external homogeneous region , region a , is a crescent shaped distribution with distinct wings .",
    "the inhomogeneous region , region b , and the internal homogeneous region , region c , show a maxwellian halo with a crescent shaped core .      for the second part of this study we use a temporally driven wave spectrum at the simulation boundary combined with a slow solar wind expansion ( @xmath54 ) to study the heating of the inhomogeneous plasma ( case 5 ) .",
    "we keep our initial conditions the same as in the previous section with the initial ion drift , but with the addition of turbulent wave spectrum of circularly polarized alfvn / cyclotron waves injected at the boundary ( see @xcite , figure 4 ) .",
    "the turbulent wave spectrum is imposed by driving non - uniform magnetic fluctuations at the boundary given by ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the @xmath69th mode amplitude , * @xmath70 is the given parameter that determines the slope of the power spectrum ( @xmath71 in our study)*. n = 300 , @xmath72 is the frequency range . in the present study",

    "@xmath75 is the value of the @xmath13-dependent random phase in the range @xmath76 varied at each @xmath13 grid location , and @xmath77 is the amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuation .",
    "this leads to the formation of circularly polarized wave spectrum due to coupling with the @xmath78 component through the field equations , and the propagation of these waves into the interior of the computational domain .    for illustration purposes ,",
    "we first calculate the temperature anisotropy evolution for cases with initial sub - alfvnic drifts and gaussian inhomogeneity .",
    "we show these results in figure [ subalfv_turb ] . on one hand",
    ", there is a large increase in the he@xmath0 ion temperature anisotropy , when the turbulent spectrum is included .",
    "the eventual decrease of the temperature anisotropy is due to the additional parallel heating caused by phase - space diffusion of the energy supplied by the turbulent spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , the proton temperature anisotropy slightly decreases , and there seems to be little proton heating due to the turbulent spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , the rate of decrease in the anisotropy is slower when turbulence is included . in comparison ,",
    "figure [ superalfv_turb ] shows the results for an initial super - alfvnic drift ( @xmath57 ) , which is unstable to the drift magnetosonic instability , for the gaussian inhomogeneity .",
    "we find that the protons are affected more by the turbulence compared to he@xmath0 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath79 the proton temperature anisotropy for the gaussian inhomogeneity case without turbulent spectrum is 1.6 , while it is only 1.4 for the case that includes the input wave spectrum ; a 13% decrease . for the sharp inhomogeneity ( not shown ) case the difference is even larger : 1.7 compared to 1.3 for the turbulent spectrum case , a 24% decrease . to better understand the cause of decrease in the proton temperature anisotropy we show the perpendicular and parallel * kinetic * energies for the modeled solar wind plasma ( figure [ energies ] ) .",
    "overall , we see that the inclusion of turbulent wave spectrum in the calculation causes an increase in the parallel and perpendicular energies for both ions and protons .",
    "in particular , the relative increase in the parallel energy of the protons due to the turbulence is the greatest ( @xmath62 30% ) , which explains the decrease in the anisotropy seen in figure [ superalfv_turb ] .",
    "it is also worth noticing that when the plasma is homogeneous ( case analyzed by @xcite ) , there is no increase in the parallel energy of the protons due to the drift .",
    "nonetheless , our inhomogeneous case shows a 25% increase ( @xmath28 case ) , and even a greater increase when the turbulent wave spectrum is included .",
    "this suggests an increased heating due to oblique waves produced by the inhomogeneity . for comparison",
    ", we calculated another example in case 6 with a different frequency range : @xmath74 $ ] ( not shown ) .",
    "we find that with the turbulent spectrum used in case 6 the peak of the ion anisotropy is slightly lower and the proton anisotropy is slightly larger but showing similar temporal evolution to case  5 .",
    "the decay of the drift was unaffected by the turbulent spectrum used .",
    "figure  [ powerspec_turb ] shows the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations evaluated in the middle of the high density region * at the end of the simulation ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the spectrum is produced by kinetic magnetosonic instability at the same time that left - hand polarized waves are resonantly absorbed and re - emitted by the he@xmath0 and the protons .",
    "the plotted spectrum is the result of the balance between these processes and the non - linear wave - particle interactions*. we compare the spectrum of cases 3a , 3b and 5a , i.e. , with initial drift only ( red ) , with initial drift and expansion ( blue ) , and initial drift , expansion and driven turbulent spectrum ( black ) , respectively .",
    "the spectrum remains nearly flat until about @xmath81 for all cases , * as this region includes the non - resonant range of the spectrum*. we show the best - fit for each spectrum in the declining region , chosen where the slope of the spectrum can be best - fitted with a power law .",
    "we find that for plasma with an initial drift * ( but no initial turbulent spectrum ) * there is no significant change in the slope of the power law , found to be @xmath82 .",
    "this value is close to that found by @xcite : @xmath83 .",
    "the small difference between the slopes of the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous cases shows that the inhomogeneity has little effect on the power spectrum of magnetic fluctuations produced by the drift instability .",
    "however , when the initial turbulent spectrum was included as a boundary condition the slope of the power law for the magnetic fluctuations decreased to @xmath84 .",
    "this decrease can be explained by the less steep slope of the injected spectrum ( @xmath85 ) compared to the slope of the drift instability produced spectrum .",
    "thus the power law of the combined magnetic fluctuations produced by the two processes is in between the two extreme values .    to further address and understand the effect on the magnetic fluctuations spectrum we show the two - dimensional spatial spectra for several cases considered .",
    "figure [ 2dpowerspec ] shows the @xmath20-space spectra for the inhomogenous plasma with ( 1 ) an initial turbulent spectrum , ( 2 ) an initial super - alfnic drift ( case 3a ) , ( 3 ) an initial super - alfnic drift with expanding solar wind ( case 3b ) , and ( 4 ) a case including all effects : turbulent wave spectrum , drift , and expansion ( case 5a ) .",
    "all results are shown at t = 250@xmath86 , * i.e. , not all cases have reached equilibrium*. from figure [ 2dpowerspec ] we can see that the magnitude of the spectrum generated by the initial drifting plasma is greater than that generated by just the injected turbulent spectrum .",
    "figures  [ 2dpowerspec]a - [ 2dpowerspec]c show one peak power concentrated in the parallel direction near @xmath87 .",
    "however , figure [ 2dpowerspec]d shows two local peaks in the power spectrum , the largest one due to the drift and the lower peak due to the turbulent spectrum , identified by comparing to the previous cases .",
    "all cases show significant power in the @xmath88 region of the @xmath89 plane , showing the presence of oblique waves in the spectrum . in comparison with results from @xcite ,",
    "we show that the inclusion of inhomogenous plasma in our model significantly enhances the production of the oblique waves in the plasma , likely due to refraction of the parallel propagating waves by the gradient of the background alfvn wave phase speed .",
    "figures [ 2dpowerspec]c and [ 2dpowerspec]d have not yet reached a fully relaxed state .",
    "therefore , the peak is still shifted and has a negative @xmath90 value . as time evolves the drift instability",
    "is damped and only * one peak due to the injected spectrum remains visible at the end of the run of the case shown in figure [ 2dpowerspec]d .",
    "*    * figure [ dispersion ] shows the dispersion relation for the waves obtained from the nonlinear 2.5d hybrid model in case 3b ( @xmath57 , with solar wind expansion @xmath51 , and gaussian inhomogeneity ) .",
    "we obtain the dispersion relation by fourier transforming in space and time the transverse magnetic fluctuations ( @xmath91 ) , which are obtained from the hybrid model simulations .",
    "figure [ dispersion]a illustrates the dispersion for the parallel waves ( @xmath92 vs. @xmath93 ) .",
    "the non - resonant ( right - hand polarized ) and resonant ( left - hand polarized ) branches of the waves are clearly visible in the figure .",
    "these branches can be related to an analytical ( vlasov ) dispersion relation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the non - resonant branches appear more clearly in blue , while the resonant branches are evident as more diffuse bands due to dissipation below or above ( depending on the quadrant ) the non - resonant branches .",
    "furthermore , figure [ dispersion]b portrays the dispersion for the perpendicular waves for the same case by fourier - transforming the perpendicular direction , showing @xmath92 vs. @xmath90 . the dispersion of the oblique wave power is evident with most of the power concentrated at low-@xmath90 region , consistent with the 2d power spectrum shown in figure [ 2dpowerspec ] .",
    "the diminished power at higher @xmath90 is signature of dissipation of the oblique waves .",
    "such branches are not obvious in models of the expanding solar wind with homogenous background ( e.g. @xcite ) . *",
    "we investigate the ion heating processes in inhomogeneous expanding proton - he@xmath0 solar wind plasma close to the sun that may lead to temperature anisotropies observed in the fast solar wind streams .",
    "we analyze the effect of the relative ion drift instabilities and the turbulent alfvn wave spectrum injected at the boundary on inhomogeneous background density plasma on the heating of the expanding solar wind . we find that * for cases with super - alfvnic relative drifts * the expansion of the solar wind has a small effect on the temperature anisotropy of the he@xmath0 ions * ( see figures [ superalfv_gauss ] and [ superalfv_sharp ] ) * , which is reduced by the inhomogeneous plasma background and increased by resonant waves perpendicular heating . on the other hand , the expansion has a more significant effect on the proton temperature anisotropy due to the smaller ( compared to he@xmath0 ions ) perpendicular heating by the instability or the injected waves . *",
    "furthermore , the expansion has a significant cooling effect for both ions and protons in cases where sub - alfvnic drifts were included ( see figure [ subalfv_gauss])*. when the temperature anisotropy and heating of the plasma are due to drift instability or the injection of a turbulence wave spectrum , the heating dominates the evolution of the temperature anisotropy and the adiabatic cooling from the expansion * for super - alfvnic drifts * is insignificant .",
    "however , when the drift is sub - alfvnic ( @xmath94 ) , the inclusion of the expansion does decrease the temperature anisotropy of the plasma significantly within the simulated time and more so of the protons . in this case",
    "there is no heating source that may have countered the cooling due to the expansion , and the effect of the expansion dominates .",
    "the he@xmath0 ion anisotropy decreases by 10% for slow expansion rate and up to 40% for a moderate expansion rate and similarly for the proton temperature anisotropy .",
    "the ion drift is not significantly affected by the expansion , while in the super - alfvnic case the drift damps faster , when the expansion is included .    as in previous hybrid modeling studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we see that the presence of a super - alfvnic drift leads to * magnetosonic * instability that affects the ions and to a rapid he@xmath0 ion heating in the perpendicular direction increasing the ion temperature anisotropy .",
    "this anisotropy decays quickly due to secondary ion - cyclotron instability resulting in emission of secondary ion - cyclotron waves , which in turn resonate with the protons causing the proton temperature anisotropy to increase following the relaxation of the he@xmath0 temperature anisotropy .",
    "our study includes an inhomogeneous density background in the initial state of the modeled solar wind plasma .",
    "the inhomogeneity does not dissipate on the time - scale considered in this study , since the low-@xmath31 plasma is near pressure - balance .",
    "we find that the inhomogeneity affects the time needed for the proton anisotropy to relax so that the sharper inhomogeneity case reaches a relaxed state faster than the gaussian case , possibly due to the production of oblique waves that accelerate the evolution of the instability .",
    "the inhomogeneity also significantly affects the ion velocity distribution as seen in figures  [ vspacegauss]c , [ vspacegauss]c , and [ xz - phasespace ] .",
    "we find that the velocity space diffusion is consistent with kinetic shell models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and with previous hybrid modeling studies of drifting ions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the perpendicular heating produces a velocity distribution that is highly non - maxwellian and which has a beam - like peak for the gaussian inhomogeneity and a crescent shape for the sharper inhomogeneity .",
    "resonance with alfvn cyclotron waves diffuses the ion velocities to lower values , giving the crescent distribution its shape .",
    "we analyze the effect of an injected turbulent spectrum at one of the boundaries and find it to increase the ion temperature anisotropy only in cases where sub - alfvnic drift was present . in the super - alfvnic case the effect of the turbulence on the ion temperature anisotropy is small compared to the heating due to the drift instability .",
    "nevertheless , the proton temperature anisotropy is decreased by the inclusion of the turbulent spectrum due to increased both parallel and perpendicular energies of ions and protons in the plasma , resulting in higher parallel heating compared to the case without the injected waves , and the corresponding decrease of anisotropy .",
    "we find that the relaxation of the super - alfvnic drift together with the magnetic turbulence spectrum injected in the inhomogeneous ( gaussian ) background density profile results in magnetic fluctuations fitted by a power - law of the form @xmath95 .",
    "the expansion and the inhomogeneity do not appear to affect the magnetic fluctuation spectrum significantly .",
    "an initial super - alfvnic drift alone in the plasma causes magnetic fluctuations with a steeper power law ( @xmath82 ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the temperature anisotropy for both ions and protons observed in fast wind streams requires perpendicular heating that is stronger than the cooling effects of solar wind expansion .",
    "thus , kinetic instability leading to perpendicular plasma heating must take place in the expanding solar wind close to the sun and possibly throughout the inner heliosphere , and both , drift instability and ion - cyclotron instability , are good candidates as demonstrated in this study .",
    "we analyzed the instability caused by a super - alfvnic drift and the injection of a turbulence spectrum and both cases succeed in producing temperature anisotropies comparable to observations .",
    "the inhomogeneity in the plasma enhances the production rate and magnitude of the oblique waves , which in turn contribute to heating .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the parallel propagating left - hand polarized cyclotron waves dominate the resonant heating of the solar wind ions ."
