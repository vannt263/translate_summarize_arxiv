    "note that @xmath22 relationship observed at 0 t can be justified even with a slight revision of the originally suggested @xmath17-spiral spin structure , since deduced ratio @xmath86 is quite large .",
    "notably , when @xmath3 and spin - spiral plane is rotated counter - clockwise , @xmath5 is found to rotate clockwise ( fig .",

    "the observed manner of @xmath5-rotation and large @xmath87 ratio are in accord with the recent dft calculation for edge - shared cuo@xmath1 chain compounds,@xcite and these features would reflect the anisotropy and sign of coupling coefficient @xmath11 in eq .",
    "cucl@xmath1 is also the first example of non - chalcogen based spiral - spin induced multiferroics . while observed @xmath88 31 @xmath81c / m@xmath82 is somewhat smaller than the calculation ( @xmath88 84 @xmath81c / m@xmath82),@xcite it is comparable with the case for other helimagnetic oxides ( @xmath89 5 @xmath81c / m@xmath82 ) . interestingly , a recent theoretical study suggested the choice of anion may largely affect the value of induced @xmath5 through the different strength of metal - ligand hybridization and spin - orbit coupling.@xcite this means that the me response can be enhanced if we choose appropriate anion as the ligand . until now",
    ", the study of ferroelectric helimagnets is almost limited to oxides , partly because their isostructural chalcogen relatives with larger anions ( i.e. sulfides or selenides ) are often electrically too leaky to perform dielectric measurements.@xcite since halogens have larger electronegativity than chalcogens , halides are better insulating and enable the investigation of me properties for a wider variety of anions .",
    "for example , most of @xmath31-type halides with @xmath90 cl , br , and i consist of stacking of undistorted triangular lattices , which realizes various types of spiral spin orders.@xcite the systematic investigation of fe properties of whole @xmath31 system will offer a good opportunity to clarify the anion dependence of magnetically - induced ferroelectricity , which may contribute to a general strategy to obtain larger me responses .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally revealed magnetically - driven ferroelectricity in an @xmath0 chain helimagnet cucl@xmath1 . observed @xmath5-behaviors under applied @xmath3 can be reproduced well within the framework of the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya model , suggesting the robustness of this me coupling mechanism even under the effect of strong quantum fluctuation .",

    "<S> magnetoelectric properties were investigated for an @xmath0 chain antiferromagnet cucl@xmath1 , which turns out to be the first example of non - chalcogen based spiral - spin induced multiferroics . upon the onset of helimagnetic order propagating along the @xmath2-axis under zero magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) , we found emergence of ferroelectric polarization along the @xmath4-axis . </S>",
    "<S> application of @xmath3 along the @xmath2-axis leads to spin - flop transition coupled with drastic suppression of ferroelectricity , and rotation of @xmath3 around the @xmath2-axis induces the rotation of spin - spiral plane and associated polarization direction . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors are explained well within the framework of the inverse dzyaloshinskii - moriya model , suggesting the robustness of this magnetoelectric coupling mechanism even under the strong quantum fluctuation . </S>"
