    "let two integers @xmath2 be given and let us consider the space of matrices @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 , equipped with the frobenius inner product @xmath6 we denote by @xmath7 the singular values of a matrix @xmath8 , by @xmath9 the space of matrices @xmath8 with maximal rank , that is @xmath10 or , equivalently , @xmath11 , and by @xmath12 the set of singular ( or rank deficient ) matrices : @xmath13 the distance of a matrix @xmath8 from @xmath12 is given by its smallest singular value : @xmath14    consider now the problem of connecting two matrices with the shortest possible path staying , as much as possible , away from the set of singular matrices .",
    "we realize this objective by considering an absolutely continuous path @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with given endpoints ( say @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) which minimizes its * condition length * defined by @xmath19 we call * minimizing condition path * an absolutely continuous path which minimizes this integral in the set of absolutely continuous paths with the same end - points .",
    "we define a * minimizing condition geodesic * as a minimizing condition path parametrized by the condition arc length , that is when @xmath20 a * condition geodesic * is an absolutely continuous path which is locally a minimizing condition geodesic .",
    "this concept of geodesic is related to the riemannian structure defined on @xmath9 by : @xmath21 we call it the * condition riemann structure * on @xmath9 .",
    "our objective is to investigate the properties of the smallest singular value @xmath22 along a condition geodesic .",
    "our main result says :    [ th-1 ] for any condition geodesic @xmath23 in @xmath9 , the map @xmath24 is convex .",
    "this theorem extends our main result in @xcite . in that paper ,",
    "the same theorem is proven for those condition geodesic arcs contained in the open subset @xmath25 that is when the smallest singular value @xmath26 is simple .",
    "the reason for this restriction is easy to explain .",
    "the smallest singular value @xmath27 is smooth in @xmath28 , and , in that case , we can use the toolbox of riemannian geometry .",
    "but it is only locally lipschitz in @xmath9 ; for this reason we call the condition structure in @xmath9 a * lipschitz - riemannian structure*.    * motivation : * let us now say a word about our motivations .",
    "the ( today ) classical papers @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite by shub and smale relate complexity bounds for homotopy methods to solve bzout s theorem to the condition number of the encountered problems along the considered homotopy path .",
    "ill - conditioned problems slow the algorithm and increase its complexity . for this reason it is natural to consider paths which avoid ill - posed problems , and , at the same time , are as short as possible . the condition metric has been designed to construct such paths .",
    "it has been introduced by shub in @xcite , then studied by beltrn and shub in @xcite in spaces of polynomial equations .",
    "the case of linear maps ( and related spaces ) appears in beltrn - dedieu - malajovich - shub @xcite and boito - dedieu @xcite .",
    "the main result relating condition metric and complexity appears in  @xcite(see also  @xcite and  @xcite ) : there is an algorithm that , given a continuous path @xmath29}$ ] in the space of systems of homogeneous polynomial equations , computes a mesh @xmath30 and approximate zeros ( in the sense of smale ) @xmath31 associated to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "this algorithm terminates in time linear in @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the maximum degree of the equations , @xmath36 is an arbitrary parameter and @xmath37 is the * condition length * of the path @xmath38 .    in the linear case , it is rather a remarkable fact that the inverse of the squared distance to singular matrices @xmath39 is log - convex along the condition geodesics .",
    "so , in particular , the maximum of @xmath40 along such paths is necessarily obtained at its endpoints and the condition geodesics stay away from singular matrices . in our last theorem ( theorem  [ the-7.8 ] ) we prove a version of our main result in the context of the solution variety @xmath41 above , the notation @xmath42 denotes the projectivization of a linear space @xmath43 .",
    "namely , it is the space ( manifold ) of real or complex lines in @xmath43 passing through the origin .",
    "for instance , @xmath44 is the classical projective plane , that can also be obtained by identifying antipodal points of the sphere @xmath45 .",
    "we think this property may help to find good preconditionners to solve linear systems which would be a good area for future research .",
    "we do nt know if the analogue of theorem  [ the-7.8 ] holds in the solution variety corresponding to the space of polynomial systems , although proposition  [ restricted - case ] proves it for systems which vanish at a given point .",
    "if self - convexity of the condition number where to hold into the condition variety itself we would have a good geometric picture of what is involved in choosing a homotopy path in an optimal ( or near optimal ) way .",
    "* outline of the paper *    the condition number is not of class @xmath46 , hence we can not apply the usual riemannian geometry to the condition metric . in * section 2 * , we introduce lipschitz- riemann structures and develop the basic results , that allow us to do differential geometry in the non - smooth case . using nonsmooth analysis techniques , we prove that any condition geodesic is @xmath47 with a locally lipschitz derivative ( theorem [ the-2.1 ] ) .",
    "such techniques are already present in boito - dedieu @xcite .    in * section 3",

    "this theorem may be of independent interest .",
    "it is so natural we would not be surprised if it is already known , but we have not found it anywhere . we were led to this theorem sometime after a conversation with john lott on hessians and riemannian submersions while he was visiting the university of toronto .",
    "the strategy for proving the main theorem is to decompose the space of matrices in a finite union of smooth manifolds , so that in each of them the metric is smooth . in * section 4",
    "* we produce this decomposition , we study the group of symmetries of the condition number and then , using theorem  [ th-2 ] , we establish self - convexity on each piece .    in * section 5 * ,",
    "we prove a result that may be of independent interest , theorem [ the-5.2 ] : piecing together convexity results on restrictions of the lipschitz - riemann structure to a union of submanifolds of varying dimensions , where the structure is smooth , to obtain a global result .    in * section 6 *",
    ", we use all these tools to finish the proof of theorem  [ th-1 ] .",

    "* we have benefited greatly from conversations with our colleagues charles pugh and vitaly kapovitch about lipschitz - riemann structures , especially those conformally equivalent to smooth structures by locally lipschitz scaling maps .",
    "some of this work was accomplished when we met not only in our intitutions , but also at the institut de matemtica de la universitat de barcelona and at the thematic program in the foundations of computational mathematics ( focm ) at the fields institute .",
