    "again , the @xmath15 coefficients of ni@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 have opposite signs as those of co@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 , but exhibit qualitatively very similar behavior . also remarkable",
    "is the fact that both @xmath93 coefficients have a very similar jump - like feature at @xmath88 .",
    "the absence of an anomaly in @xmath15 at these phase transitions implies that the anomalies in @xmath10 and @xmath37 scale using a single parameter , which however is not constant but rather increases with decreasing temperature ( fig .",
    "[ dl_alpha_gamma_all ] ( g - i ) ) .",
    "the grneisen parameters probe the volume / pressure dependence of the magnetic energy scales . for the simplest magnetic phase transition ,",
    "one expects only the exchange energy to be volume / pressure dependent , leading to a temperature independent grneisen parameter .",
    "clearly our results show that the situation in co@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 and ni@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 is much more complicated . beyond this complexity ,",
    "the divergent - like behavior of @xmath15 is reminiscent of the grneisen parameters of systems close to a quantum phase transition , at which grneisen parameters necessarily diverge .",
    "@xcite    the grneisen parameters for the intermediate compounds change , as the @xmath10 coefficients , from the co- to the ni - like behavior as the ni content @xmath6 increases .",
    "two types of behaviors are particularly interesting and are shown in fig .",
    "[ gamma_doped ] . for @xmath94 , all @xmath15 coefficients appear to diverge in magnitude down to @xmath92 , where there is a sharp kink in the curves and below which the magnitude decreases again sharply .",
    "this behavior is clearly different from the pure co@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 case , where the `` hti@xmath95 '' transition is hardly visible in @xmath15 .",
    "however , the overall behavior looks like what one would obtain if all the transitions occurring in co@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 were replaced by a single second - order transition . for @xmath96 , on the other hand , all @xmath15 exhibit a jump - like change at @xmath97 , with clear sign changes of @xmath15 occurring for the @xmath14- and @xmath13-axes .",
    "all the above features point to the very complex nature of magnetism in ( co@xmath0ni@xmath1)@xmath2v@xmath3o@xmath4 , which results from an unusual combination of geometrical frustration , a complex set of competing magnetic interactions , possible disorder , as well as the doping - induced change of the ion moment ( from @xmath7 to @xmath9 ) etc .",
