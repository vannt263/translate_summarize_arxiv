    "how do close binaries @xmath14 form ?",
    "an intriguing clue comes from their surprisingly high fraction having a tertiary companion , reaching as much as @xmath15 for systems with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this lends support to the `` kozai cycles plus tidal friction '' ( kctf ) formation channel advocated by several authors @xcite . in kctf ,",
    "a tertiary companion on a highly inclined outer orbit can excite the inner binary orbit , initially having a long period , to very high eccentricity during kozai - lidov cycles , which allows efficient tidal dissipation to take place during close pericenter passages , eventually shrinking the orbital period to a few days .",
    "one clear implication of kctf is that there should exist a population of highly - eccentric binaries in the process of migrating to their final close - in orbits .",
    "such a prediction was studied in the context of a similar formation process of `` hot jupiters '' ( close - in jovian - mass companions ) by @xcite . in this letter , we explore observational implications of such a population which is possibly responsible for close - binary formation .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the features of a steady - state distribution of migrating binaries due to tidal dissipation in analogy to migrating jupiters discussed in @xcite .",
    "stars have been forming at a roughly constant rate over the age of the galaxy , therefore one would expect a steady - state source of new distant binaries that constantly migrate to lower periods , `` feeding '' the close - binary population .",
    "tidal dissipation drains orbital energy but hardly changes the angular momentum of an eccentric binary .",
    "while losing energy due to tidal dissipation , eccentric binaries migrate on tracks of constant orbital angular momentum corresponding to constant @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 equals the period of the final circularized close binary ( once circular , tidal dissipation ceases to operate in the tidally locked system ) .",
    "the rate of energy dissipation is a strong function of binary separation , and for an eccentric orbit , most of the energy loss occurs during the pericenter passage . at high @xmath2 , due to the constant angular momentum",
    ", the pericenter passages have approximately the same parabolic shape , and the energy lost each orbit , @xmath19 , is approximately the same .",
    "this implies an average energy loss rate @xmath20 , which results in a steady state distribution @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "this distribution at high @xmath2 is relatively independent of tidal dissipation physics . at moderate and low @xmath2 ,",
    "the distribution is sensitive to the poorly understood tidal dissipation processes .",
    "the distribution obtained for the commonly assumed equilibrium tide model ( e.g , @xcite ) is derived in @xcite .",
    "an additional complication is that angular momentum oscillates while the kozai mechanism operates .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this does not significantly affect the resulting distribution as long as we consider narrow bins in angular momentum ( or @xmath18 ) in which most of the dissipation occurs . in this letter",
    ", we focus on the long - period , highly eccentric members in this population , which are simple to analyze theoretically and , as shown below , are easily distinguishable observationally .",
    "making meaningful statistical studies of the binary distribution requires an un - biased sample . the commonly adopted study on multiplicity of solar - type primaries is from a complete , volume - limited ( within 22 pc and spectral type f7-g9 ) sample of @xmath23 systems by @xcite .",
    "they identify three period regimes .",
    "binaries with periods shorter than about @xmath24 have eccentricities close to zero and are thought to be efficiently circularized by the strong tidal dissipation at small separations . those with periods longer than @xmath25",
    "are found to be consistent with an ambartsumian distribution , @xmath26 , which is expected if energy conserving dynamical perturbations operate . in the intermediate period range @xmath27 , the distribution in @xmath2",
    "is described as bell - shaped with an average of @xmath28 , which has since been widely accepted as reflecting the initial distribution at binary formation .",
    "they note that the largest eccentricities in the @xmath29 regime seem to be curiously populated by triple systems .",
    "they further note that just beyond the selection criterion of their complete sample , there exists some clear outliers to the eccentricity distribution , and interestingly two of them , hd 137763 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) and hd 114260 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) are found to have additional companions .",
    "@xcite provide a new volume - limited sample selected using hipparcos parallax ( within 25 pc and stellar type f6-k3 ) including 454 solar - type stars , a factor of @xmath34 larger in size than that of @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the period and eccentricity distribution of binaries in this sample .",
    "systems with known companions ( multiples ) are shown in filled circles while those without are plotted in crosses . as pointed out by the authors , the upper envelope of eccentricity for systems with @xmath35 appears to mostly consist of multiples , indicative of kozai oscillations .",
    "the five `` '' systems , each with eccentricity larger than that of any binary with shorter period , have the following parameters : @xmath36 @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .    these envelope multiples , which possibly consist of @xmath8 of all main - sequence stellar systems , are very interesting in the context of kctf .",
    "figure 1 shows constant angular momentum tracks , as discussed in section  [ sec : steadystate ] , of @xmath42 , which enclose the envelope .",
    "this raises the exciting possibility that these systems may represent a population of highly eccentric binaries in steady - state kctf migration . if true , the fact that the @xmath18 values of these systems are close to the circularization threshold of @xmath43 is not surprising .",
    "systems with @xmath44 , circularize quickly , while those with @xmath45 , do not significantly migrate .",
    "systems at @xmath46 migrate on a time scale comparable to the age of the galaxy , implying that a significant fraction of them should be currently migrating .",
    "curiously , the tertiary companions of the above five systems all share very long , @xmath47 , orbital periods",
    ". more detailed examination of their orbital parameters indicate that due to the large perturber separations , the amplitude of the kozai oscillations ( if present ) is suppressed by relativistic precession ( see the discussions on `` quenched '' kozai oscillation in @xcite and figure 1 of @xcite for an example ) , which would naturally explain why they form an upper eccentric envelope .",
    "unfortunately , the small - number ( @xmath48 ) statistics makes it difficult to robustly establish the existence of this interesting and to investigate its properties .",
    "_ kepler _ mission has great potential to provide a complete sample that is orders - of - magnitude larger than @xcite to probe the above - mentioned population between @xmath49 and @xmath50 that consists of possibly @xmath8 of main - sequence stellar systems .",
    "_ kepler _ is a high - cadence , high - precision mission that aims to find habitable earth - size planets .",
    "it has been monitoring @xmath51 fgk stars continuously with high cadence and high photometric precision since 2009 , and is designed to operate for @xmath52 with the possibility of an extension of several more years .",
    "the latest data public release available on 10 january , 2012 includes 16-month long light curves .",
    "there are potentially @xmath53 systems in total belonging to the among _ kepler _ targets .",
    "a straightforward method to detect binary stars is to look for eclipses i.e. , eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) .",
    "for an isotropic distribution of orbital orientations , the chance of seeing an eb with at least one of the stars being eclipsed is @xmath54^{-1}(1 + 2e/\\pi)$ ] if the sum of the radii of the two stars @xmath55 is much smaller than their separation . this geometrical probability is roughly constant for a given orbital angular momentum @xmath56^{1/2}$ ] , and for a track with @xmath57 and high @xmath2 , is approximately @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the total binary mass .",
    "we therefore expect to find of order @xmath60 s within the with @xmath61 .",
    "while the period is a direct observable of an light curve , the eccentricity is not .",
    "one way to accurately determine @xmath2 is to make radial velocity observations .",
    "a second option is to carefully model the eclipse light curve using detailed characterization of the stellar parameters , allowing for a reasonable estimate of the eccentricity . in this letter",
    "we follow a third path by focusing on a subsample of s with both primary and secondary eclipses observed , upon which one can place strict lower limits on the eccentricity by measuring the timing separation between the two eclipses . we show that a robust selection of highly eccentric binaries can be made by searching for long period eclipses with short primary - secondary separations .",
    "the probability of observing both eclipses is given by @xmath62 , which amounts to about @xmath63 of all eclipsing systems at high @xmath2 .",
    "we thus expect to find about two dozen systems from the .",
    "the timing difference between the eclipses , @xmath64 is given by @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the argument of pericenter . at high @xmath2",
    "the eclipses are most likely to occur near pericenter and the separation between the two eclipses is of order the pericenter passage time @xmath67 .",
    "the separation reaches minimum at @xmath68 and is given by @xmath69{}\\frac{2p_f}{3\\pi}.\\ ] ] and is approximated by @xmath70 to an accuracy of better than @xmath71 .",
    "we search for s with periods longer than @xmath72 with secondary eclipses separated by less than @xmath73 from the primary eclipses .",
    "any s that survive the latter cut must have an eccentricity larger than @xmath74 , which satisfies @xmath75 .",
    "the resulting minimal eccentricity at @xmath76 as a function of @xmath77 is shown in a curved dashed line in figure [ fig : rag10 ] .",
    "the period cut @xmath72 is also shown as a dashed line .",
    "any observed that satisfies these observational cuts must reside in the ( @xmath78 ) domain defined by these two lines , which allows for a robust selection of the .",
    "moreover , @xmath79 of systems with @xmath80 and @xmath81 that show two eclipses , satisfy @xmath82 implying that this cut does not significantly affect systems in the .",
    "we search for s in the janurary 2012 release of kepler data , with all long - cadence ( @xmath83 ) , pre - search data conditioning ( pdc ) light curves from quarters q1-q6 ( spanning @xmath84 months in total ) .",
    "first we identify eclipse candidates using a simple criterion that at least 3 consecutive points are above @xmath85 deviations from the local median ( determined with a window of 200 points ) .",
    "then candidate light curves are selected by requiring pairs of candidate eclipses to repeat with periods longer than @xmath86 and that at least one eclipse be deeper than @xmath87 . by visually inspecting each of the selected light curves , we identified 13 binary systems with double eclipses having timing separations smaller than @xmath24 ( and periods greater than @xmath86 ) .",
    "six out of these are listed in the _ kepler _ eb catalog @xcite , which is based on the _ kepler _ q0-q2 data ( with a total time span of @xmath88 ) . among the binaries in the catalog",
    ", we found an additional system that survives our period and eclipse separation cuts , but for which both eclipses have depths smaller than @xmath87 .",
    "therefore our selection appears to be efficient .",
    "the parameters of the 14 systems are listed in table 1 and plotted as red arrows in figure [ fig : rag10 ] showing their periods and minimal eccentricities derived from equation , based on their measured @xmath89 .",
    "the light curves of the three systems with the longest periods are shown in figure [ fig : lc ] for illustration .",
    "clearly the search is incomplete at long periods , @xmath90 , at which fewer than 3 primary eclipses occur during the observation time span .",
    "our detections establish that at least @xmath8 of stellar systems are binaries ( with additional possible companions ) in the selected region in the ( @xmath78 ) plane .",
    "_ kepler _ s exquisite photometric precision opens up a venue of binary star detections with ellipsoidal , reflection / irradiation , and relativistic beaming modulations ( e.g. @xcite ) . for very eccentric binaries , these modulations show up as short `` pulses '' that reach maximum amplitude near pericenter and last about the pericenter passage time .",
    "@xcite reported the first _ kepler _ detection of such `` eccentric pulses '' in koi-54 , with @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "@xcite reported discoveries of 17 systems with @xmath93 , dubbed as `` heartbeat stars '' .    in the case that ellipsoidal variations dominate ( for small pericenter separation @xmath94 ) , orbital parameters including eccentricity , argument of pericenter and the inclination can be robustly extracted from the shape of the pulses @xcite .",
    "in contrast to s , the eccentric ellipsoidal variations can be virtually seen at all inclinations with similar amplitude , thus in principle allowing the detection of orders of magnitude more such systems than from s. the amplitude of the ellipsoidal pulse due to a sun - like primary in a long - period , highly eccentric system with mass ratio @xmath95 and @xmath96 is roughly @xmath97 with a width of @xmath98 .",
    "@xcite demonstrates that at _ kepler _ magnitude @xmath99 ( half of all _ kepler _ targets ) , the majority of the _ kepler _ dwarfs reach better than @xmath100 precision over @xmath101 interval , including photometric noise and stellar variability .",
    "therefore the prospect of detecting a large number of sun - like binaries exhibiting eccentric ellipsoidal variations is promising .",
    "one simple way to find eccentric pulses is to examine the light curves ( with either one or both of the primary and secondary eclipses ) and inspect the region in the vicinity of the eclipses where such pulses are most likely to occur .",
    "the known periodicity helps distinguishing the pulses from other sources of variabilities .",
    "figure [ fig : pulse ] shows the folded light curve of the kic @xmath102 with detection of pulses with amplitude of @xmath103 .",
    "the pulse shape , shown in the bottom panel , is well described by the linear - perturbation model of ellipsoidal variations @xmath104}/r^3 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath105 is the true anomaly and @xmath106 is the instantaneous binary separation , for parameters ( @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) , plotted in solid line .",
    "these parameters also agree with the timings of the primary and secondary eclipses , shown in dash lines .",
    "clearly a pulse similar to that of kic @xmath102 can be detected without the aid of eclipses .",
    "since the geometric bias can be well estimated , one could make consistency checks between the systems detected among the eclipsing binaries and the ones without the eclipses .",
    "the light curves of a few other candidates ( kic @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) with periods ranging from @xmath113 to @xmath114 are shown in figure [ fig : pulsesexamples ] .",
    "kic @xmath110 and kic @xmath111 are associated with single eclipses ( both of which are included in the catalog by @xcite ) while kic @xmath112 does not exhibit any eclipses .",
    "some other probable candidates include kic @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which show possible pulses with amplitudes similar to those of other variabilities in the light curve .",
    "note that the eccentricity pulse signals have relatively large amplitude for early - type stars , raising the interesting possibility of studying the possible eccentric migrating binaries for those stars .",
    "the presence of more than a dozen highly - eccentric , long - period _ kepler _ eclipsing binaries confirm that @xmath8 of stellar systems reside in the p - e plane near @xmath117 , as hinted by the @xcite sample .",
    "the binaries in this stream may be excited to high eccentricity in kozai cycles and experience tidal migration in the process of forming close binaries .",
    "this interpretation has multiple implications that can be tested in the near future : ( 1 ) a growing population at increasing periods is expected from the steady - state distribution , following @xmath10 .",
    "this can be probed by future releases of _ kepler _ data , which will enable the exploration of longer - period regimes .",
    "one interesting possibility is the identification of the location from which these binaries originate .",
    "larger samples can be obtained by using radial - velocity followup of s or by searching for eccentricity pulses in the _ kepler _ data .",
    "( 2 ) if affected by kozai , these systems should have additional companions which can be searched for using high - resolution imaging .",
    "( 3 ) direct tests of kozai oscillations can be achieved by preforming differential astrometry measurements of mutual inclinations between the inner binary and the companion ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the nearby multiples in the stream .",
