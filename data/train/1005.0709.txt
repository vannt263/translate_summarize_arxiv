    "the ibis / isgri telescope @xcite on board the integral satellite @xcite has detected a large number of new supergiant high mass x - ray binaries ( sghmxb ) characterized by a high absorption column ( n@xmath5 @xmath6 ) and/or by fast bright transient events .",
    "this result was achieved thanks to a continuous monitoring of the galactic plane with deep exposure of the galactic centre and thanks to a combination of isgri large field of view , good sensitivity , and wide energy range .",

    "the telescope , thanks to its large field of view ( 1.4 steradian half coded ) and its pointing strategy , covers a fraction between 50% and 80% of the sky every day .",
    "this has allowed the detection of many of the new integral hmxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the collection of their long term light curves and of their spectral energy distributions .",
    "the long and continuous monitoring of these sources allows to investigate the intrinsic emission variability , to search for long periodicities ( orbital periods ) and to discover the presence of eclipse events .",
    "the role of @xmath1-bat is therefore fundamental to unveil the nature and the geometry of these binary systems .    in this letter",
    "we analyze the soft and hard x - ray data collected by @xmath1  on igr  j164934348 .",
    "this source was discovered by integral in 2004 @xcite and it was initially associated with the radio pulsar psr  j16494349 because of a spatial coincidence . a later integral observation with a deep exposure allowed to reduce the positional uncertainty and to reject the pulsar association @xcite . a follow - up observation with _",

    "the period resolution @xcite is given by p@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number of trial profile phase bins , and @xmath31140,213,639.0 s is the data time span .",

    "the weighting procedure was adopted to deal with the large span of @xmath35 and it is justified because the bat data are background dominated",

    "the highest feature , with a @xmath21 value of @xmath37 , is p@xmath38 d , where the error is evaluated as the standard deviation of the gaussian that best fits the @xmath21 values around the p@xmath17 peak with @xmath39 .",
    "we also see other evident features at periods multiple of p@xmath17 ( 2p@xmath17 , 3p@xmath17 , 4p@xmath17 , 5p@xmath17 in fig .  [ period ] ) . the pulsed profile ( fig .",
    "[ period ] , b ) folded at p@xmath17 with t@xmath40=54173.757 mjd , shows a flat intensity level , abruptly broken by a deep full eclipse .",
    "the phase coverage of the light curve bins ( fig",
    ".  [ period ] , c ) shows that this dip is not due to an accidental under - sampling of the light curve at these phases .",
    "the centroid of the eclipse , evaluated by fitting the data around the dip with a gaussian model , is at phase @xmath41 corresponding to t@xmath42p@xmath17 mjd .    as a consequence of the time variability of the source and of the presence of a periodic signal",
    ", the average @xmath21 in the periodogram is far from the average value expected for white noise @xmath43 and the @xmath21 statistics can not be applied to evaluate the significance of the detected periodicity .",
    "therefore , we applied two alternative methods to evaluate the significance of p@xmath17 .    1 .",
    "we fit the periodogram with a second order polynomial [ f@xmath23(p ) ] and subtracted the trend from the @xmath21 distribution .",
    "the value of z=@xmath21-f@xmath23(p ) at p@xmath17 is 196.6 .",
    "we therefore built the histogram of the z distribution ( fig .",
    "[ period ] , d ) from 0.5 to 10 d excluding the interval around p@xmath17 and those around p@xmath18 , p@xmath19 , and p@xmath20 as marked in fig",
    ".  [ period ] ( a ) .",
    "the latter features are not noise fluctuations , but are tied to p@xmath17 : p@xmath18 ( = p@xmath44 ) is due to the presence of the deep eclipse , still visible in the light curve folded at half of the period ; p@xmath19 ( @xmath45d@xmath46p@xmath47p@xmath48 ) and p@xmath20 ( @xmath49d@xmath50p@xmath47p@xmath51^{-1}$ ] ) are due to beat frequencies between p@xmath17 and p@xmath18 .",
    "we fit the resulting distribution for z@xmath52 with an exponential function and evaluated the integral of the best - fit function beyond z=196.6 .",
    "this integral yields a number of chance occurrences due to noise of @xmath53 , corresponding to a significance for the detected feature of @xmath54 standard deviations in gaussian statistics . 2 .",
    "we generated 1000 light curves scrambling the observed rates while keeeping unchanged the temporal distribution of the bins .",
    "for each of them we have produced the periodogram in the 0.510 d time interval ( 49335 trial periods ) .",
    "the highest value obtained among all these periodograms is 97.9 .",
    "therefore , the probability of random occurrence for the observed @xmath21 value ( @xmath37 ) is lower than @xmath55 that corresponds to a significance of p@xmath17 higher than 5.5 standard deviations .",
    "figure  [ lc ] shows the 1550 kev light curve of , obtained excluding all pointings where the source was at an off - axis angle higher than 40 deg , with a bin time of p@xmath56 d , excluding bins with an exposure fraction less than 5%.the average intensity in each p@xmath17 bin shows a maximum variability of a factor @xmath57 .",
    "the knowledge of the orbital period and of the middle eclipse time allows us to determine that the @xmath1-xrt observation was performed at the orbital phase interval 0.450.51 with respect to the epoch of the eclipse .",
    "the 0.210 kev light curve shows a persistent emission with an average count rate of 0.376@xmath580.015 count s@xmath26 and a variability within a factor 3 .",
    "we applied the folding technique to search for short periodicities in the time range 51000 s. the xrt ssb arrival times were corrected for the pulsar binary motion using p@xmath17 , t@xmath59 , a semi - major axis @xmath60 lt - s ( see sect .  4 for its derivation ) , and assuming an orbit inclination of 90 degrees and an accentricity e=0 .",
    "we found no evidence for any significant periodic signal .",
    "we have presented the results obtained from the analysis of the data collected by @xmath1-bat during the first 54 months of the swift mission on the supergiant hmxb igr  j164934348 .",
    "the source is detected at a significance level of @xmath221 standard deviations .",
    "the long monitoring coupled with a good observation duty cycle ( @xmath61 per day ) allowed us to unveil a periodicity of @xmath62 d that we interpreted as the orbital period of the binary system .",

    "* for an b0.5 ib star , of radius @xmath69 ) and a typical neutron star mass of @xmath70 we obtain @xmath71 .",

    "the duration of the eclipse ( @xmath73 of the orbital period ) is roughly consistent with the occultation of the compact source by the companion star in a highly inclined orbit with low eccentricity .",
    "the 1550 kev light curve of igr  j164934348 is variable up to a factor @xmath220 on timescales of @xmath2300 s while its average over an orbital period shows a variability up to a factor @xmath24 .",
