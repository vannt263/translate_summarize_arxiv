    "2002 ) , the goal has been to identify substantial samples of high - redshift ly@xmath2 emitters in order to study such diverse topics as the formation of galaxies in the early universe , early structure formation , reionization , and the interactions of galaxies with the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the advent of deep , wide - field , narrowband surveys ( e.g. , hu et al .  2004 ; hereafter , h04 ; wang et al .",
    "2005 ; shimasaku et al .  2006 ;",
    "kashikawa et al .  2006 ; ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ) has recently made it possible to obtain substantial numbers of galaxies at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where gaps in the night sky emission permit deep studies , for addressing these topics .",
    "however , the straightforward interpretation of these survey results has been plagued by statistical and cosmic variance from field to field ( e.g. , hu & cowie 2006 ) and by the absence of extensive spectroscopic follow - up of the primarily photometrically selected samples .",
    "as we shall show in the present work , photometric samples can have a substantial degree of contamination , and spectroscopy is necessary to remove these interlopers . with high - resolution spectroscopic follow - ups of the candidates , it is possible both to confirm that the emission is due to redshifted ly@xmath2 and to estimate the statistics of interlopers .",
    "here we present the results of a wide - field , narrowband survey with highly complete spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we used the @xmath19 field - of - view suprimecam mosaic ccd camera ( miyazaki et al .",
    "2002 ) on the subaru 8.2  m telescope to observe seven different target fields to search for ly@xmath2 emitters at @xmath0 ( nb816 ) and @xmath1 ( nb912 , nb921 ) . in section  [ secnarrow ] we summarize the narrowband and continuum imaging together with the candidate selection .",
    "the data obtained in these narrowbands are comparable in depth , and we have analyzed them with uniform selection and processing criteria .",
    "we have spectroscopically observed nearly all the photometrically selected objects with the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; faber et al .",
    "2003 ) on the keck  ii 10  m telescope , which we also describe in section  [ secnarrow ] .",
    "the resulting photometric and spectroscopic samples form a large , consistent data set with which to tackle the cosmological problems .",
    "we provide spectra for 88 @xmath0 and 30 @xmath1 ly@xmath2 emitting galaxies .",
    "this forms the largest sample of confirmed high - redshift galaxies in the very distant universe .",
    "we give the catalogs , thumbnail images , and spectra in the appendix .    in section  [ secdisc ]",
    "we discuss the relative properties of the samples at @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the emission - line properties provided by the spectra are key diagnostics of the intergalactic gas properties at these redshifts .",
    "they may be used to probe the neutral fraction of the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , gnedin & prada  2004 ; santos 2004 ; zheng et al .",
    "2010 ) and thus to study the ionization state of the igm and its redshift evolution at early times .",
    "theoretical models make predictions of the impact of the neutral portion of the igm on the line profile of ly@xmath2 emission and also upon the redshift evolution of the ly@xmath2 luminosity function ( e.g. , barkana & loeb 2001 ; mesinger & furlanetto 2004 ; dijkstra et al .  2007 ; dijkstra & wyithe 2010 ) . in section  [ secdisc ]",
    "we analyze the line width distributions at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , showing that there are only small changes in the properties of the lines over this range and that the line properties are remarkably similar for most of the objects .",
    "we find that there is a dependence of line width on ly@xmath2 luminosity , with the more luminous objects being broader .",
    "we show that the luminosity function ( lf ) drops by a factor of two at @xmath6 relative to that at @xmath5 , and the @xmath5 value is a factor of four lower than that at @xmath20 .",
    "however , the characteristic luminosity is unchanged .",
    "the results are for the observed luminosities , and the fall - off will be less for the intrinsic lfs when the effects of intergalactic scattering are allowed for . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will combine the optical data with longer wavelength observations from the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and discuss the uv continuum properties of the high - redshift sample and the ly@xmath2 escape fraction .",

    "the seventh field ( ssa17 ) is isolated .",
    "the very central region of the a370 field is lensed by the foreground massive cluster a370 at @xmath28 .",
    "we obtained the narrowband images of each field with suprimecam under photometric or near - photometric conditions .",
    "we observed each field with a 120    ( fwhm ) filter ( nb816 ) centered at a nominal wavelength of 8150    corresponding to a @xmath0 selection and a 120    ( fwhm ) filter ( nb912 ) centered at a nominal wavelength of 9140    corresponding to a @xmath1 selection .",

    "the complex shape of the suprimecam filter profiles requires careful treatments of the conversion of narrowband magnitudes to line fluxes and of the determination of the accessible volume ( e.g. , gronwall et al .",

    "we obtained @xmath33 hour exposures for the nb816 filter and @xmath34 hour exposures for the nb912 filter .",
    "the longer exposures in the nb912 filter partially compensate for the lower camera throughput at this wavelength , so the observations provide comparable depth exposures in the two bands .",
    "however , the nb912 images are still slightly shallower than those in the nb816 band .",
    "we took the data as a sequence of dithered background - limited exposures with alternate sequences rotated by 90  deg .",
    "we always obtained the corresponding continuum exposures in the same observing run as the narrowband exposures to avoid falsely identifying transients  such as high - redshift supernovae or kuiper belt objects  as ly@xmath2 candidates .",

    "( 2004 ) gives a detailed description of the full reduction procedure that we used to process the images .",
    "we calibrated the suprimecam data using photometric and spectrophotometric standard stars ( turnshek et al .",

    "allowing for overlaps , the combined area of the 7 fields in the survey is 4168  arcmin@xmath4 .",
    "we note that the present calibration of the ssa22 field is about 0.2  mag fainter than that given in h04 .",
    "this is typical of the errors introduced in the calibrations and in the choice of method for measuring the magnitudes .",
    "thus , we adopt it as an estimate of the systematic error in the absolute measurements .",
    "the relative magnitudes are extremely well determined in the field compared to the absolute calibration , so the relative counts and lfs in the nb912 and nb816 bands are insensitive to this issue .",

    "indeed , the _ hst _ counts agree closely with the nb912 counts .",

    "we visually inspected each usel candidate to eliminate artifacts , and we also visually searched the images for usels that might have been missed in the initial catalog because they were blended with neighboring objects . in figure  [ line_excess ]",

    "five of the eliminated candidates have been spectroscopically observed : two are spurious , one is a low - redshift emitter , and two are genuine @xmath5 emitters .",

    "however , the level of destruction is dependent on the exact escape route , which depends in turn on the structure of the interstellar medium ( e.g. , neufeld 1991 ; finkelstein et al .",

    "in addition , they show that there is a wide range of observed ly@xmath2 luminosities relative to the intrinsic luminosity . however , zheng et al .  use a very simplified galaxy ly@xmath2 profile , and the variation of these profiles may also play an important role in the process ( e.g. , dijkstra & wyithe 2010 ) .",
    "in particular , redder and wider galaxy ly@xmath2 profiles will be more likely to produce observable ly@xmath2 emission lines after the subsequent igm propagation .",
    "we refer to this as pre - stretching before the shortening imposed by the igm .",
    "these processes will determine both the output shape of the line and the distribution of line widths ; the latter may provide one of the strongest constraints on the modeling . in section  [ secwid ]",
    "we show that the shapes of the lines are remarkably invariant and that they span a fairly narrow range in width .",
    "we might also expect that there would be a progressive reduction in the fraction of galaxies having strong ly@xmath2 as we move to higher neutral fractions in the igm at higher redshifts .",
    "we show in section  [ secnum ] that this is not the case and that the number of ly@xmath2 emitters falls more slowly as we move from @xmath5 to @xmath6 than the number of uv - continuum selected galaxies does . however , there is some weak evidence that the lines are becoming narrower and have slightly smaller equivalent widths at @xmath6 than they have at @xmath5 .",

    "they also have some broad general properties : a fairly sharp cut - off at the short wavelength side , a narrower peak , an elbow ( by which we mean the slight plateau at wavelengths redward of the peak and at fluxes of about 0.3 - 0.5 of the maximum and which is most clearly seen in the wider spectra ) , and then a trailing long - wavelength edge .",
    "they may be compared with figure  15 of hu et al .",

    "we overplot the averaged spectrum at the same redshift ( red dashed line ) .",
    "the similarity of the individual spectra to the averaged spectrum is remarkable .",
    "however , there are some slight differences .",
    "for example , when we separate out the wider spectra at the two redshifts using the directly measured fwhm from the individual spectra , we find that the wider spectra have a more developed long - wavelength elbow .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ compare_spectra](b ) , where we have made the averaged spectra at the two redshifts only from sources whose line widths are greater than @xmath149    in the rest frame .",
    "we hereafter refer to these as wide averaged spectra .            the ly@xmath2 lines are poorly fit by a gaussian because of the fairly sharp cut - off at the short - wavelength side .",
    "thus , in order to provide a simple fit to the spectra , we used a demi - gaussian consisting only of the long - wavelength side of the gaussian together with a constant long - wavelength continuum , as shown in figure  [ wid_shape ] ( green curve ) .",
    "this parameterization was introduced in h04 . for each spectrum",
    "we convolved the demi - gaussian with the instrument profile ( blue dotted curve ) and fitted the result to the observations using the idl mpfit programs of markwardt ( 2009 ) .",
    "we show this for ( a ) the full averaged spectrum at @xmath5 ; ( b ) the full averaged spectrum at @xmath6 ; ( c ) the wide averaged spectrum at @xmath5 ; ( d ) the wide averaged spectrum at @xmath6 .",
    "we find that this simple model has sufficient freedom with its four free parameters ( the normalization , the cut - off wavelength , the line width , and the red continuum level ) to provide a good fit to all the spectra .",
    "( this is in agreement with h04 s conclusion for their @xmath5 line profile but not with kashikawa et al .",

    "we define the rest - frame fwhm of the lines as the half - width half - maximum ( hwhm ) of the gaussian prior to truncation .",
    "we give the hwhm in the tables in the appendix , together with the @xmath43 errors , for all the individual spectra .",
    "for the average of all the spectra , the fwhm ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) is @xmath150    at @xmath5 and @xmath151    at @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding rest - frame equivalent widths , which we define as the area of the line divided by the red continuum level , are @xmath152    at @xmath5 and @xmath153    at @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that the equivalent widths have dropped slightly between the two redshifts .",
    "however , the error is primarily in the determination of the red continuum , and the difficulty of accurately measuring this quantity and the possibility of systematic errors should be kept in mind in assessing this result",

    "[ width_lx ] , width=326 ]    the line widths are robustly measured and can be obtained for each of the individual spectra . however , the long - wavelength continuua are often too weak to be measured in the individual spectra , so we do not attempt to measure equivalent widths in the individual spectra .",
    "we compare the distribution of line widths in the two samples in figure  [ width_hist ] , where the red histogram shows the @xmath5 sample and the blue histogram shows the @xmath6 sample .",
    "there is just over a factor of two spread in the widths , which suggests that the spread in galaxy properties combines with the transfer effects to produce a fairly uniform output line with a velocity width in the range @xmath156  km  s@xmath24 . as with the averaged spectra ,",
    "the lines are narrower at the higher redshift with a median value of @xmath7    at @xmath6 and @xmath8    at @xmath5 . however , the difference is only marginally significant .",
    "a mann - whitney rank sum test rejects the two samples as being drawn from the same population at the @xmath157 confidence level .",
    "part of the spread in the line widths appears to be caused by a dependence of the fwhm on the ly@xmath2 luminosity , @xmath158 . in figure",

    "this is in contrast to kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 , who suggested a slight increase with decreasing luminosity in their @xmath6 sample ; see their figure  11 .",

    "2010 ) , using keck deimos spectra , reverse the kashikawa et al .  2006 result and find evidence at the 2.5 sigma level for a rise in the fwhm with luminosity .",
    "the effect is highly significant in our @xmath5 sample : a mann - whitney rank sum test shows that there is only a 0.005 probability that the population with @xmath159 is drawn from the same distribution of fwhm as those at brighter luminosities .",
    "the spearman correlation coefficient is 0.42 at a @xmath160 significance for the @xmath5 sample and 0.58 at a @xmath161 significance for the @xmath6 sample .    in each case",
    "we have fitted a power law of the form fwhm @xmath155 to the data .",

    "these fits are shown by the red line ( @xmath5 ) and the blue line ( @xmath6 ) in figure  [ width_lx ] .",
    "there are many effects which could contribute to there being a relation between the observed line luminosity and the line width .",
    "possibly the simplest interpretation is that the higher luminosity galaxies are more massive and the emerging l@xmath2 line is wider .",
    "however , detailed modeling , including all of the line transfer effects , is necessary to fully interpret this result .",

    "the observed ranges of @xmath164 per field at @xmath5 and @xmath165 per field at @xmath6 are fully consistent with the spread expected from the small number statistics .",
    "we do not require any additional effects from cosmic variance to understand this , though such effects may be expected to be present .",
    "the similarities of the depths of the fields and of the shapes and rest - frame widths of the two filters allow us to make a simple estimate of the decrease in the number of ly@xmath2 emitters with increasing redshift directly from the number counts .",
    "the number counts in the two redshift ranges are shown versus narrowband magnitude in figure  [ compare_counts](a ) .",
    "we denote the @xmath5 counts by red squares and the @xmath6 counts by blue diamonds .",
    "as would be expected from the initial selection , the counts rise smoothly to near @xmath166 and then drop rapidly at fainter magnitudes . in this discussion and in the derivation of the lf in the next subsection",
    ", we shall restrict to a sample with @xmath167 where we believe the samples in both bands are substantially complete both in the initial selection and in the spectroscopic followup .    to compare the number counts , we corrected the nb816 magnitudes to equivalent nb912 magnitudes by adding the difference in magnitude corresponding to the relative luminosity distance . in figure  [ compare_counts](b )",
    "we compare the @xmath5 counts ( for the equivalent nb912 magnitudes ) , corrected for the initial photometric catalog incompleteness , with the @xmath6 counts , corrected in the same way .",

    "this is made more complex by the presence of the continuum , which slightly pulls the selection to the short - wavelength side of the filter , as can be seen in figure  [ filtshape ] and also in figure  13 of h04 and in figure  3 of kashikawa et al .",
    "the continuum is extremely faint and often undetected in the spectra and even in the continuum images , so this effect is not easy to model exactly , but it is necessary to include it to make a correct conversion from the narrowband magnitude to a line flux .",

    "( 2010 ) lf ( cyan curve ) at low luminosities , but it is higher at the bright end .",
    "the largest differences appear to be with the photometrically based lfs of ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and ouchi et al .",
    "the presently derived lfs are typically about a factor of two lower .",
    "this is not a consequence of the magnitude calibrations , since , as we have discussed previously , both the ouchi et al .   and the kashikawa et al .",
    "magnitude measurements are fainter than the present photometry , and this would have the opposite effect ( i.e. , it would raise our lfs relative to theirs rather than reduce them ) .",
    "the real reason for the reduction in our lfs relative to theirs seems to come from our having excluded the spectroscopically unconfirmed objects .",
    "ouchi et al .  (",
    "2008 ) observed 29 of their photometrically selected galaxies and identified 17 as ly@xmath2 emitters .",
    "however , they estimated the contamination based on only the objects brighter than a narrowband magnitude of 24.5 , where three - quarters of the objects were identified , and concluded that the maximum contamination was 25% .",
    "since this was small , they did not apply a correction .",
    "however , the numbers on which this calculation are based are small , and the probability of incorrect selections may be expected to increase as we move to fainter magnitudes . thus , the bright selection is likely to be inappropriate for the full sample .    in the present work we could not spectroscopically",
    "confirm approximately half of our photometrically selected objects in our 25.5 magnitude limited sample .",
    "thus , the factor of two difference between our @xmath5 lf and the ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) @xmath5 lf may be entirely due to this .",
    "it is possible that some of the photometrically selected objects that are unconfirmed in the spectroscopy are genuine ly@xmath2 emitters where the spectroscopy was problematic .",
    "however , for many , even with multiple observations we were unable to confirm spectroscopically the objects as emitters .",
    "we therefore think the present spectroscopically based ly@xmath2 lfs represent the best estimate , and the photometric lfs may be viewed as extreme upper limits .    in figure  [ lum_fun ]",
    "we show the differential lfs at @xmath6 ( blue diamonds ) and at @xmath5 ( red squares ) .",
    "the error bars are @xmath154 based on the poisson errors corresponding to the number of objects in the bin .",
    "for the @xmath6 case we also show the @xmath43 upper limit at the highest luminosity with the downward pointing arrow .",
    "we show the maximum likelihood fits for @xmath180 with the blue and red curves . in the figure",
    "we compare the present lfs with those measured at lower redshifts .",
    "we show the lf at @xmath201 derived by cowie et al .",
    "( 2010 ) using _ galex _ spectroscopy with the black dotted curve .",
    "we show the lf at @xmath20 from ouchi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) with the green dashed curve .",
    "other determinations at this redshift by van breukelen et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , gronwall et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and cowie & hu ( 1998 ) are extremely similar , and we do not plot them separately .",
    "clearly the low - redshift evolution of the ly@xmath2 lf between @xmath201 and @xmath177 is much more spectacular than that seen at the higher redshifts .",
    "locally there are very few luminous ly@xmath2 objects and very little light density in the ly@xmath2 emission line . however , at @xmath202 the maximum luminosity is relatively invariant , and the number density is falling off slowly with increasing redshift . for a fixed @xmath180 the light density in the ly@xmath2 line at @xmath5 is about 22% of that at @xmath20 , and the light density in the ly@xmath2 line at @xmath6 is about 11% of that at @xmath20 .",
    "when the values are corrected for the effects of the intergalactic scattering , which substantially reduce the observed ly@xmath2 luminosities relative to the intrinsic luminosities , the change between @xmath20 and @xmath5 will be less , probably no more than a decrease of a factor of 2 .",
    "we shall make a more detailed comparison to the evolution of the uv continuum light at these redshifts in a subsequent paper ( l. cowie et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) .",
