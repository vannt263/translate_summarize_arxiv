    "another significant work involved the deflection angle and intensities for the images formed due to the schwarzschild black hole in terms of elliptic integrals of the first kind @xcite .",
    "considering the schwarzschild black hole for the strong gl , virbhadra and ellis obtained the lens equation and introduced a method to calculate the bending angle .",
