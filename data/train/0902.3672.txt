    "supernova ( sn ) explosions are prominent phenomena through which heavy elements are released into interstellar space .",
    "the ejected materials often constitute fragments , or ejecta knots , although their creation mechanism has not been well - understood .",
    "in fact , such fragments of ejecta have been discovered from several supernova remnants ( snrs ) : e.g. , tycho ( decourchelle et al .  2001 ) , cas  a ( laming & hwang 2003 ; fesen et al .  2006 ) , pup  a ( winkler & kirshner 1985 ; katsuda et al .",
    "2008 ) , and g292.0 + 1.8 ( park et al .  2007 ) . as mentioned below ,",
    "is also one of the most interesting snrs from which some candidates of ejecta fragments can be observed .",
    "the vela snr is considered to be the remnant of a type ii - p sn explosion of the progenitor star with the mass of @xmath0  25@xmath1 ( gvaramadze 1999 ) .",
    "the age of the snr has been estimated to be @xmath2  yr from the spin down rate of psr b083345 ( the vela pulsar : taylor et al .",
    "1993 ) , which is associated with the snr ( e.g. , weiler & sramek 1988 ) . since this snr has the largest angular size ( @xmath3 : aschenbach et al .  1995",
    "; lu & aschenbach 2000 ) among observable snrs , it is a very ideal target for studying the detailed structure of an old snr .",
    "aschenbach et al .  (",
    "1995 ) observed the entire vela snr in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , and discovered six isolated fragment - like features , named `` shrapnels '' a to f , which have overrun the primary blast wave shock boundary .",
    "the opening angles of the shrapnels bow - shock features suggest them to be supersonically moving in tenuous ambient matter .",
    "the symmetry axis of each shrapnel traces back to the center of the snr , which is very close to the vela pulsar .",
    "such a configuration suggests that the shrapnels are associated with the fossil material of the sn explosion ; they had probably traveled behind the blast wave for a long time and passed its front at the late stage when the blast wave had decelerated .",
    "if they are really the clumps of the sn ejecta , it is expected that the chemical compositions of the shrapnels are abundant in heavy elements .",
    "therefore , some of the shrapnels have been studied to reveal the metal abundances using several recent x - ray missions .",
    "shrapnel  a is the most well - investigated one .",
    "tsunemi et al .",
    "( 1999a ) observed the shrapnel with _",
    "asca _ , and found a strong si k - shell emission line with relatively weak emission from other elements .",
    "then , the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations confirmed that the shrapnel is significantly over - abundant in si , while the other elements , i.e. , o , ne , mg , and fe , have solar or sub - solar abundances ( miyata et al .  2001 ; katsuda & tsunemi 2006 : hereafter kt06 ) . they thus concluded that shrapnel  a originated from a deep ( si - rich ) layer of the progenitor star .",
    "the relative abundances among the heavy elements were found to be almost uniform in the entire shrapnel .    on the other hand , the _ asca _ spectra of shrapnel  d , which is the brightest and largest among the six shrapnels , indicated over - abundances of o , ne , and mg ( tsunemi et al .",
    "1999b ) . using _ xmm - newton _ , katsuda & tsunemi ( 2005 ; hereafter kt05 ) confirmed that the abundance ratios of o - ne - mg to fe are significantly larger than solar , which is consistent with the view that this shrapnel is a fragment of the ejecta from a shallow layer of the progenitor .",
    "interestingly , several bright ejecta knots have been discovered in the northern part of the vela snr by the recent _ xmm - newton _ observations ( miceli et al .",
    "they suggested that these knots would be `` new '' shrapnels hidden inside the vela main shell by the projection effect .",
    "the relative abundances of these knots were found to be quite similar to those observed in shrapnel  d ; o , ne , and mg were much more abundant than those of the other elements .",
    "shrapnel  b is another candidate of the ejecta fragment discovered with _",
    "rosat _ all - sky survey , and the second brightest next to shrapnel  d ( aschenbach et al .",
    "although it was observed with _ asca _",
    ", the elemental abundances could not be determined due to the poor photon statistics ( tsunemi et al .",
    "1999b ) . in this paper ,",
    "therefore , we investigate the chemical and physical properties of shrapnel  b , by analyzing high quality spectral data obtained with _ suzaku_. in  2 , we introduce the observation and data reduction procedure .",
    "the results of our analysis are presented in  3 .",
    "finally , we develop the discussion and summarize our findings in  4 and  5 , respectively . we assume the distance to the vela snr to be 250  pc , following cha et al .",

    "november 57 ( observation i d = 501085010 ) .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) of the observation is shown in the image of the entire region of shrapnel  b.    in this paper , we concentrate on the data obtained with the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis : koyama et al .",

    "the latter has superior sensitivity in the 0.21.0  kev band with a significantly improved energy resolution compared to previous x - ray ccd cameras .",
    "the xis were operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode with spaced - row charge injection ( sci ) technique ( uchiyama et al .",
    "2008 ) . for the following data reduction , the headas software of version 6.5 was used .",
    "we employed the revision 2.0 data products , but reprocessed the data using the ` xispi ` software and the ` makepi ` files of 20080905 .",
    "these files include the latest calibration results for the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) and gain .",
    "we cleaned the reprocessed data following the standard screening criteria and obtained an effective exposure time of @xmath658  ksec .",
    "although all four sensors were active at the time of the observation , the xis2 became inoperable soon after the use of the sci technique .",
    "the energy scale of the xis2 for the sci - on mode was therefore not well calibrated ( uchiyama et al.2008 ) and we do not use the data obtained by the xis2 in the subsequent analysis .",

    "an image of the non x - ray background ( nxb ) in the same energy band was obtained using the ` xisnxbgen ` software and subtracted from the raw image .",
    "the nxb data were constructed from the night - earth database by sorting on the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity .",

    "it is also extended to the opposite side of the rim ( toward the main shell of the vela snr ) , although its surface brightness there is lower than in the other regions .",

    "it is known that the energy resolution of the xis is gradually degrading due to radiation damage while in orbit ( koyama et al .",
    "also , the efficiency for the detection of soft x - rays has decreased because of the build - up of the contaminating material on the optical blocking filters ( obf ) of the xis due to out - gassing from the satellite .",
    "since these effects vary with the time , we examined the differences in the xis performance for the shrapnel  b and blank sky observations .",
    "we found that the difference in energy resolution is negligible , at @xmath15  ev and @xmath16  ev ( fwhm ) at 0.5  kev for the shrapnel  b and blank sky data , respectively . on the other hand",

    "<S> this abundance pattern is similar to that in shrapnel  d , except that the enhancements of the lighter elements are less prominent , suggesting more extensive mixing with the interstellar medium ( ism ) in shrapnel  b. the contribution of the ism is considered to be larger at the trailing region , because the absolute abundances of some elements there are depleted relative to those at the shrapnel s head . </S>"
