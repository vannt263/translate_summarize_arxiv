    "understanding the processes of galaxy formation and evolution is one of the outstanding problems of modern astronomy .",
    "it is now clear that the growth and feeding of the central black hole of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) and the formation of its host galaxy must be intimately connected , as evidenced by the striking correlations between the properties of supermassive black holes and the stellar systems in which they reside @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is now strongly suspected that agn activity is critical in the regulation of star formation in the host galaxy either by removing all the gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) , by heating it ( e.g. @xcite ) or both @xcite",
    ". however , an observational link between agn activity and quenching of star formation has not yet been established ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to understand how the agn and galaxy formation processes are connected requires a detailed census of the agn population as well as detailed study of individual objects .",
    "the visibility and detectability of an agn is determined by the interplay among black hole mass , accretion rate , gas distribution , dust geometry and the amount of star formation in the host galaxy .",
    "thus , no single selection method provides a complete view of how galaxies and agn co - evolve .",
    "many surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite for a review ) have focused on x - ray selection because x - ray emission is a universal feature of agn accretion .",
    "however , x - ray selection has limited sensitivity to heavily obscured and/or low accretion rate sources , even in the deepest surveys @xcite . in particular , examples of the most heavily - obscured agn , the so - called compton - thick ( ct ) agn , which have @xmath20@xmath51 for compton scattering or @xmath8@xmath510@xmath11  @xmath7 , are mostly found in the local universe .",
    "only a few of these sources have been identified at higher redshifts , although this is simply due to selection effects @xcite .",
    "in contrast , early agn population synthesis models that can fit the x - ray background ( xrb ) spectral shape and intensity @xcite require @xmath520 - 30% ct agn in order to explain the observed peak at @xmath530  kev in the xrb radiation .",
    "recently , @xcite combined observations of local ( @xmath15@xmath140.05 ) agn at very hard x - rays ( e@xmath220  kev ) , using the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory ( integral ) and swift satellites , with xrb models and concluded that the ct agn fraction is only @xmath510% at these redshifts .",
    "they conclude that ct agn represent a similarly small fraction of the total xrb radiation and total black hole growth .",
    "however , because only @xmath52% of the xrb comes from ct agn at @xmath15@xmath22 and only a few sources are known at such high redshifts , this population still remains basically unconstrained , with up to an order of magnitude uncertainty in number density @xcite .",
    "because the energy absorbed at optical to x - ray wavelengths is later re - emitted in the mid - ir , it is expected that agn , in particular the most obscured ones , should be very bright mid - ir sources ( @xcite and references therein ) , easily detectable in observations with the spitzer observatory .",
    "sources having mid - ir excesses , relative to their rest - frame optical and uv emission , have been identified as potential ct agn candidates at @xmath15@xmath52 ( @xcite and others ) . however , because of the strong connection between vigorous star formation and agn activity in the most luminous infrared sources @xcite , the relative contribution of these processes is still uncertain and remains controversial ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to detect ct agn up to high redshifts , deep multiwavelength coverage is critical .",
    "the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdf - s ) is one of the best fields to carry out this study .",
    "the rich multiwavelength data available in the ecdf - s includes four @xmath5250  ksec chandra pointings covering an area of @xmath50.3  deg@xmath21 , and deep spitzer data in the irac bands from the spitzer irac / musyc public legacy in ecdf - s ( simple ) survey and at 24  @xmath22 m from the far - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( fidel ) .",
    "the 24  @xmath22 m depth in this field is @xmath535  @xmath22jy , comparable to the deep great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) observations .    in this paper",
    ", we present a study of the properties of the ct agn candidates in the ecdf - s selected from their 24  @xmath22 m to optical flux ratio and rest - frame optical to uv colors . in section 2",
    "we describe the multiwavelength data used in this work , while our selection scheme is presented in section 3 .",
    "the properties of the sources individually detected in x - rays are discussed in section 4 , while the remaining sources are studied in section 5 .",
    "the near and mid ir colors , x - ray to mid - ir flux ratios and space density of our sources are presented in section 6 , and our conclusions are reported in section 7 .",
    "we assume a @xmath23cdm cosmology with @xmath24=0.7 , @xmath25=0.3 and @xmath26=0.7 , in agreement with the most recent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the full ecdf - s was covered by chandra as part of a cycle 5 guest observer program ( pi : n. brandt ) .",
    "the total area covered is @xmath50.3 deg@xmath21 to a depth of @xmath27230 ksec .",

    "the catalog of @xcite includes 651 sources to similar flux limits , using a more conservative rejection of periods of higher background , thus reducing the number of spurious sources but excluding a few real sources as well . in this work ,",
    "we use mainly the @xcite catalog . however , when performing stacking analysis we further exclude sources individually detected in the @xcite catalog and/or in the deeper 1 and 2 msec observations available in the central @xmath270.1  deg@xmath21 , presented by @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the ecdf - s was observed extensively at near and mid - ir wavelengths by the spitzer space telescope .",

    "the ecdf - s was also observed at longer wavelengths in the fidel survey , which obtained data at 24 , 70 and 160  @xmath22 m .",
    "because of the significant decrease in sensitivity at longer wavelengths , mainly due to source confusion , only the 24  @xmath22 m data are considered in this work .",
    "details about the data reduction and catalog creation were presented by @xcite .",
    "the approximate flux limit of the 24  @xmath22 m data used here is @xmath535@xmath22jy . for comparison ,",
    "the flux limit of the goods 24  @xmath22 m data is @xmath512@xmath22jy @xcite , while @xcite studied only sources with @xmath31@xmath240@xmath22jy in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) proper .",
    "the work of @xcite in the cosmos field used only the shallow cycle 2 mips data to a flux limit of @xmath5550  @xmath22jy .",

    "the ecdf - s was imaged in 18 medium - band optical filters using the wide - field suprime camera on the subaru telescope .",
    "these filters range from 4270 to 8560   and are optimized for photometric redshift determinations @xcite .",
    "the data reach an average depth of @xmath526 magnitudes ( 5@xmath36 , ab ) , extending redshift determinations to sources much fainter than most spectroscopic redshift surveys .",
    "more details about these observations , data reduction and catalogs will be presented by c. cardamone et al .",
    "( 2009 , in prep . ) and in section  [ photo_z ] .",
    "rich optical spectroscopic data exist in the ecdf - s .",
    "we took advantage of the eso / goods - cdfs spectroscopy master catalogue which compiles spectroscopic data from 11 different sources , mostly using 8 - 10 meter class telescopes .",
    "in particular , many of the spectroscopic redshifts for the x - ray sources in the cdf - s proper were reported by @xcite using the vlt telescopes with the fors1/fors2 spectrographs .",
    "in addition , spectroscopic observations for 339 x - ray sources in the ecdf - s field using the vlt / vimos and magellan / imacs are reported by @xcite .    given the very faint optical magnitudes of the ecdf - s x - ray sources , obtaining redshifts and identifications",
    "is a very hard , time - demanding task . in particular ,",
    "optical spectroscopy is often out of reach , even for state - of - the - art 10m - class telescopes .",
    "however , near - ir spectroscopy offers a higher chance of success , not only because these sources are significantly brighter at these wavelengths , but more importantly because , based on the experience with similar sources in other fields , they are found at redshifts @xmath15=13 , where the typical optical emission lines are shifted to the near - ir . for the brighter sources we used the spectrograph for integral field observations in the near infrared ( sinfoni ; @xcite ) at the vlt , and the multi - object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ; @xcite ) at the subaru 8 m telescope . for the remaining sources in our sample we have to rely on photometric redshifts , which are relatively accurate because of the deep subaru medium - band photometry described below .",
    "a total of 16 hours were granted to observe four x - ray sources in the ecdf - s with @xmath32-@xmath4@xmath27 using the vlt / sinfoni integral field unit ( ifu ) as part of program 080.a-0612 .",
    "the observations were carried out in service mode by the paranal staff in the october 2007- january 2008 period .",
    "we attempted to observe one of the sources ( xid 647 ) with the laser guide star facility ; however , due to technical problems , these observations were cancelled .",
    "of the remaining three sources , two have ir - red excesses , xids 277 and 580 , and one , xid 57 , was not detected at 24  @xmath22 m despite a very red optical / near - ir color ( @xmath3-@xmath4=6.56 ) , and hence is not included in the sample discussed in this paper .    for these sources we used sinfoni in the 0.25@xmath37 spatial resolution mode , which provides a field of view of 8@xmath37@xmath108@xmath37 .",
    "the h+k grism , which provides a wavelength coverage of 1.452.45  @xmath22 m and a resolution of r@xmath51500 , was used .",
    "the total exposure time was 3 hours for xid 580 and 2.7 hours for xid 277 . in each case , a square dithering pattern with 4@xmath37 offsets was performed so that the source was always in the field of view .",
    "this pattern was repeated four times .",
    "data were reduced using the official eso sinfoni pipeline v1.9.4 .",
    "the sinfoni data reduction cookbook , provided by the paranal science operations group was followed .",

    "moircs was used in its multi - object mask mode , in order to use a sample of nearby bright stars to do the source acquisition .",
    "the @xmath38 grism , which provides a resolution of @xmath5700 in the 1.32.5  @xmath22 m wavelength range , was used .",
    "ten - minute individual integrations were performed , after which the source was dithered by 3@xmath37 along the slit following a standard abba routine in order to allow for an accurate sky subtraction .",
    "the total exposure time was 3 hours .",

    "wavelength calibration was performed using oh sky - lines as reference and flux calibration was based on observations of hd20758 , a g2v star , taken during the same night .      in order to obtain highly accurate photometric redshifts for all of the optically detected sources in the region of the ecdf - s , we obtained 18 medium band images of the field .",
    "our deep medium - band subaru imaging reaches @xmath39 , 2 magnitudes deeper than previous cdfs medium band imaging ( combo-17 reaches @xmath40 with 12 medium band filters and 10% accuracy ; @xcite ) , and provides accurate redshifts ( @xmath41 accuracy ) and detailed spectral energy distributions for @xmath42% of the detected x - ray sources .",
    "the subaru images reach nearly all of the x - ray selected agn .",
    "the greater number of filters and their even spacing give an effective spectral resolution of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the catalog was created using the deep bvr image for detection @xcite , and contains roughly 60,000 sources with detailed spectral energy distribution .",
    "the catalog includes color - matched photometry from all 18 medium bands , in addition fluxes from the optical and near - ir ground based imaging ( see @xcite for more details on the broad band data ) .",
    "details of the medium - band data reduction and characteristics are provided in cardamone et al .",
    "( 2009 , in prep ) .    in order to obtain accurate photometric redshifts",
    ", we used eazy ( easy and accurate zphot from yale ) , a program optimized to provide high quality redshifts over 0@xmath14@xmath15@xmath144 @xcite .",
    "eazy is a new user friendly , full featured redshift fitting code , including a user - friedly interface based on hyperz @xcite and the use of priors ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the template set and the magnitude priors are based on semi - analytical models which are complete to very faint magnitudes rather than highly biased spectroscopic samples , and so are particularly useful for samples of objects such as our optically - faint mid - ir - selected sources , where complete spectroscopic calibration samples are not available .",
    "further , eazy introduces a template error function to account for wavelength - dependent template mismatch rather than relying on minizing the scatter between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts of the subsample of sources bright enough to have spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "eazy allows for linear combinations of the templates sets .",
    "we make use of this feature including an additional broad - line agn template when fitting the x - ray sources .",
    "eazy assigns each object a redshift by marginalizing over the full posterior probability distribution rather than maximizing the likelihood .",
    "we compute the photometric redshifts for the sources detected in the combined bvr image using the default eazy parameters , adopting the default template error function and r - band photometric prior , and including the optical and near - ir ground based coverage from the musyc survey @xcite in addition to our medium band data .",
    "we find a median @xmath44/(@xmath45 ) of 0.01 for all sources with spectroscopic redshifts out to @xmath15@xmath55 .",
    "limiting ourselves to the subsample of x - ray sources , we do only slightly worse , @xmath44/(@xmath45)=0.011 , but the fraction of outliers doubles to 20% .",
    "overall , for @xmath46@xmath15/(1+@xmath15 ) , this is a factor of three better than is currently done using broad band data @xcite .",
    "we find good quality photometric redshifts ( @xmath47@xmath14 1 ; @xcite ) down to r - band magnitude of ab=26 for 60% of the sample .",
    "for many of the remaining sources poor fits are obtained because the photometry is too uncertain , due to faintness of the sources , or intrinsic variability in the source over the time period of which the photometry was taken @xcite .",
    "there are also cases where the intrinsic sed may not be matched by those provided in the template set or degeneracies in color - z space can result in multiple peaks in the redshift - probability distribution .",
    "if no restriction in the quality parameter , @xmath47 , is used the statistical quality of the photometric redshifts degrades only slightly , to @xmath46@xmath15/(1+@xmath15)=0.016 with an outlier fraction of 27% .",
    "overall , with medium band photometry we have achieved highly accurate photometric redshifts for the majority of the sources in the ecdf - s down to very faint magnitudes .",
    "x - ray observations have been very efficient in finding unobscured and moderately obscured agn up to high redshifts and low luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , highly obscured , particularly compton - thick agn , have been significantly excluded even from the deep chandra and xmm - newton surveys .",
    "because most of the radiation absorbed at x - ray and uv wavelengths is then re - emitted in the mid- and far - ir , recent studies at these energies , mostly taking advantage of spitzer observations , have been very successful in finding heavily - obscured agn candidates missed by x - ray selection up to high redshifts @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite presented a selection method based on the 24  @xmath22 m to r band flux ratio and @xmath3-@xmath4 color ; specifically , @xmath31/@xmath48@xmath21000 and @xmath3-@xmath4@xmath24.5 ( vega ) .",
    "according to simulations based on stacking of the x - ray signal , they estimate the fraction of heavily - obscured agn in this sample to be greater than 80% @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite found a large number of ct agn candidates by selecting sources which show a significant excess in the star formation rate measured from ir light , compared to the value derived in the ultraviolet .",
    "however , @xcite showed , using mid - ir spectroscopy and adding far - ir photometric data for the sources selected using the @xcite method , that in only @xmath530% of the cases the observed mid - ir excess was due to the presence of an agn , while in the majority of the sources the presence of strong aromatic pah features explained the discrepancy in the derived star formation rates .",

    "the fraction of infrared - red sources with a direct x - ray detection is @xmath59% , smaller than the 16% reported by @xcite for the cdf - s observations , and significantly smaller than the fraction of direct x - ray detections in the cosmos field ( 40% ; @xcite ) . as can be seen in fig .",

    "a total of 18 sources in the ir - red excess region were significantly detected individually in x - rays and included in the catalog of @xcite . in addition , six more sources were detected in the 2-msec chandra observations covering the central cdfs region @xcite ; two of the latter sources were included in the @xcite catalog , but were not reported by @xcite .",

    "this particular wavelength was chosen since it is nearly unaffected by obscuration ( e.g. , @xcite ) and it was also used by previous studies of the local agn population ( e.g. , @xcite ) , thus allowing for a direct comparison with our high - redshift sample .",
