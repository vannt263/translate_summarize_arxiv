    "reverberation mapping ( @xcite ) is the most successful method employed for measuring the central black hole mass in type  1 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . rather than relying on spatially - resolved observations ,",
    "reverberation mapping resolves the influence of the black hole in the time domain through spectroscopic monitoring of changes in the continuum flux and the delayed response , or `` echo , '' in the broad emission lines .",
    "the time lag between these changes , @xmath6 , depends on the light - travel time across the broad - line region ( blr ) .",
    "combining the radius of the blr , @xmath7 , with the velocity width of the broad emission line gives the virial mass of the central black hole .    to date",
    ", successful reverberation - mapping studies have been carried out for approximately 36 active galaxies ( compiled by @xcite ) , mostly probing black hole masses in the range @xmath8  m@xmath2 .",
    "studies of lower - mass agns have been restricted by their lower luminosities , requiring telescopes larger than the typical 1.5-m apertures that have been employed . with the goal of extending the mass range probed by reverberation studies , we have carried out a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign on the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope , targeting 13 agns with expected black hole masses in the range @xmath1  m@xmath2 .",
    "we present here the first results from this project : an analysis of the h@xmath3 reverberation in the nearby ( @xmath9 ) seyfert galaxy arp  151 ( mrk  40 ) .",
    "full campaign details and results will be presented in a series of forthcoming papers .",
    "broad - band johnson @xmath10 images of arp  151 were obtained at the 32-inch tenagra ii telescope in southern arizona most nights between calendar dates 2008 february 26 and may 15 .",
    "typical exposure times were @xmath11s .",
    "the images were reduced following standard techniques .",
    "the flux of the agn was measured through a circular aperture of radius 4.35 , and differential photometry was obtained relative to 8 stars within the field.% of the light within this aperture comes from the host galaxy starlight . ]",
    "absolute flux calibrations were determined on a photometric night using the landolt sa-101 and sa-109 standard star fields .",
    "the calibrated light curve is shown in figure  1 .",
    "for the cross - correlation analysis , the @xmath10-band magnitudes were converted to fluxes .",
    "lcccc    @xmath10 band & 60 & 1.03 & @xmath12 & 0.0197 + 5100  & 43 & 1.02 & @xmath13 & 0.0614 + h@xmath3 & 43 & 1.02 & @xmath14 & 0.0241 +      spectroscopic monitoring was carried out at the lick observatory 3-m shane telescope with the kast dual spectrograph .",
    "arp  151 was observed from march 24  may 20 on a total of 43 nights .",
    "we restricted our observations to the kast red - side ccd and employed the 600  lines  mm@xmath15 grating with spectral coverage over the range 43007100 .",
    "spectra were obtained at a fixed position angle of 90  through a 4-wide slit .",
    "exposures were usually @xmath16s at an airmass of @xmath17 , resulting in a typical signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath18 ) of @xmath19 per pixel at rest - frame 5100  in the combined spectra .",
    "the images were reduced with iraf and the spectra were extracted with a width of 13 pixels ( 10.1 ) , with sky regions of width 6 pixels beginning at a distance of 19 pixels .",
    "flux calibrations were determined from nightly spectra of standard stars .    to mitigate the effects of slit losses and variable seeing and transparency , we employed the spectral scaling algorithm of @xcite to scale the total flux of the narrow [ ] @xmath20 doublet in each individual spectrum to match the [ ] flux in a reference spectrum created from the spectra obtained on the 10 nights with the best weather and seeing conditions .",
    "this method accounts for differences in the overall flux scale , as well as small wavelength shifts and small differences in spectral resolution , and has been shown to result in spectrophotometric accuracies of @xmath21% @xcite .",
    "finally , the spectroscopic light curves were measured .",
    "the continuum flux was measured in the observed - frame window 51875227(rest - frame 5100 ) .",
    "the flux in this window is a combination of the agn continuum flux , which is variable , and a constant component from the host - galaxy starlight .",
    "the h@xmath3 flux was measured by fitting a linear continuum under the h@xmath3 emission line , determined from the continuum flux at 48504900  and 51755225 , and then integrating the emission - line flux above the continuum from 49005050 .",
    "this technique includes the flux contribution from the narrow h@xmath3 emission line , which is simply a constant offset .",
    "the resultant light curves are presented in figure  1 , with statistical properties listed in table  1 .",
    "figure  2 shows the mean and root - mean - square ( rms ) spectra , where the rms spectrum shows the standard deviation of all the spectra relative to the mean spectrum ( i.e. , the variable components of the spectra ) .",
    "for the time - series analysis , we place more emphasis on the @xmath10-band light curve as the driving , continuum light curve , although we also consider the lower @xmath18 light curve of the 5100  flux . to determine the average time lag between variations in the continuum flux and variations in the h@xmath3 emission - line flux , we follow the standard practice of cross - correlating the light curves using the interpolation cross - correlation function ( iccf ) method ( @xcite ) as well as the discrete correlation function ( dcf ) method @xcite , with the @xcite modifications to both .",
    "the resultant cross - correlation functions are shown in figure  3 .",
    "the uncertainties in the time lag are determined using the monte carlo `` flux randomization / random subset sampling '' method described by @xcite . in short ,",
    "the method samples a random subset of the data points in the light curves , randomizes the fluxes by applying a gaussian deviation within the flux uncertainties , and cross - correlates the modified light curves .",
    "the procedure is carried out 1000 times , and a distribution of lag measurements is built up .",
    "we include two specific measurements of the lag in table  2 : @xmath22 , the location of the maximum of the cross - correlation function @xmath23 ; and @xmath24 , the centroid of the points near the peak of the function with @xmath25 .",
    "the uncertainties on @xmath22 and @xmath24 are set such that 15.87% of the monte carlo realizations fall below the range indicated by the uncertainties , and 15.87% fall above this range ( i.e. , @xmath26 uncertainties for a gaussian distribution ) .",
    "we measure an average observed - frame lag of @xmath27days between the @xmath10-band and h@xmath3 light curves .",
    "the values listed in table  2 are corrected for time dilation effects .",
    "the width of the broad h@xmath3 emission line was measured in the mean and rms spectra .",
    "we report here two separate measures of the line width : the full - width at half - maximum flux ( fwhm ) and the line dispersion , @xmath28 , which is the second moment of the emission - line profile @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the line widths are again set using monte carlo random subset sampling methods . in this case , a random subset of the spectra is chosen and a mean and rms spectrum are created , from which the fwhm and @xmath28 are measured . a distribution of line - width measurements is built up through 1000 realizations , from which we take the mean and the standard deviation to be the line width and its typical uncertainty , respectively .",
    "additional systematic errors , such as those due to the exact determination of the continuum contribution , are not included in these estimates of the uncertainty .",
    "the line widths presented in table  2 have been corrected for the resolution of the spectrograph following @xcite .      following the usual assumption that the blr kinematics are gravitationally driven , the black hole mass is determined via the virial equation    @xmath29    where @xmath6 is the mean time delay for the region of interest ( here , the h@xmath3-emitting region ) , @xmath30 is the velocity of gas in that region , @xmath31 is the speed of light",
    ", @xmath32 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath33 is a scaling factor of order unity that depends on the detailed geometry and kinematics of the region .    with the premise that the @xmath34 relationship for local , quiescent galaxies holds for agns and their host galaxies , @xcite find that @xmath35 for reverberation - based masses .",
    "this particular scaling is appropriate when @xmath24 and @xmath36 are used for the lag and line width in the black hole mass determination . for the measurements presented here ,",
    "the @xcite  normalization gives @xmath37  m@xmath2 .",
    "individual reverberation masses , however , are subject to a typical factor of @xmath38 uncertainty ( @xcite ) , likely due to differences in the intrinsic , but unknown , @xmath33 value for each individual system . also listed in table  2 is the `` virial product , '' assuming @xmath39 .",
    "the black hole mass in arp  151 is smaller than the estimate based on the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath40  km  s@xmath15 ; @xcite ) and the @xmath41 relationship of @xcite , which predicts @xmath42  m@xmath2 , but the two are consistent within the known scatter for reverberation - based masses and the @xmath34 relationship .",
    "lcc    @xmath24 & @xmath43 & days + @xmath22 & @xmath44 & days + @xmath28  ( mean ) & @xmath45 & km  s@xmath15 + fwhm  ( mean ) & @xmath46 & km  s@xmath15 + @xmath28  ( rms ) & @xmath47 & km  s@xmath15 + fwhm  ( rms ) & @xmath48 & km  s@xmath15 + @xmath49 & @xmath50 & @xmath51  m@xmath2 + @xmath52 & @xmath53 & @xmath51  m@xmath2 +    a key goal of reverberation mapping is to recover the full transfer function ( time delay vs. velocity structure ) responsible for the shape of the emission - line light curve in response to the driving continuum light curve .",
    "determining the transfer function is the most promising method to potentially provide detailed information on the geometry and kinematics of the blr . while some hints of the transfer function shape have been seen in certain high - quality reverberation data sets ( i.e. , @xcite ) , a full recovery of the transfer function has not yet been achieved .",
    "we carried out an initial analysis of the velocity - resolved time lag information for arp  151 by binning the h@xmath3 emission line in velocity space , where each of the eight bins contained an equal amount of variable flux .",
    "eight light curves were created , one for each velocity bin , and the light curves were each cross - correlated with the @xmath10-band light curve using the methods in  3.1 .",
    "figure  4 shows the results of this analysis : there is a clear gradient in the gas response where the blueshifted h@xmath3 emission lags the response in the redshifted h@xmath3 emission .",
    "this is the typical signature of radial infall : the gas on the far side of the agn is moving toward us , and the gas on the near side is moving away from us . outflowing ( i.e. , wind - driven ) gas would produce the opposite effect ( short lags blueshifted and long lags redshifted ) while pure rotation would produce a symmetric pattern around zero velocity . only outflow",
    "specifically precludes a determination of @xmath52 due to the non - gravitational motion of the blr gas .",
    "while the kinematics of the blr h@xmath3-emitting gas in arp  151 show a strong signature of radial infall , a full two - dimensional echo map of the velocity and time delay structure in the spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) must be recovered before we can fully explain the details of the blr geometry and kinematics .",
    "such an effort is beyond the scope of this paper , but is currently being pursued .",
    "the results presented here demonstrate the clearest signature of gravitational infall in the blr of an agn to date .",
    "some indications of infalling gas have been seen in the broad line response in other objects , such as ngc  5548 ( e.g. , @xcite ) and fairall  9 @xcite .",
    "as such , agn blrs seem to commonly exhibit signatures of infalling gas ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath33 value in equation  1 is directly dependent on the kinematics of the blr , thereby resulting in a different @xmath33 value for an agn blr with radial infall than for a blr with keplerian rotation .",
    "the @xcite value of @xmath54 is determined empirically and is independent of specific blr models .",
    "subsumed into the population average , @xmath55 , are the signatures of kinematic and geometric states that are common among agns with reverberation results .",
    "while it is almost certain that the individual details of each blr will result in somewhat different intrinsic @xmath33 values for every agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there is currently no reason to expect that the @xmath33 value for arp  151 is wildly discrepant from the population average , or to suspect the mass derived here of having uncertainties larger than those typically expected for reverberation masses .",
    "we have presented the first light curves and reverberation analysis from our agn monitoring campaign at lick observatory .",
    "we detect a clear lag in the broad h@xmath3 emission - line response to changes in the continuum flux for arp  151 , and we present a measurement of the black hole mass assuming the @xcite normalization . initial analysis of velocity - resolved time delays in the h@xmath3 line shows a strong signature of infalling gas , but further work is needed to map out the detailed structure and kinematics of the blr in arp  151 .",
    "we see strong variability in other emission lines , including h@xmath56 , h@xmath57 , and , the analysis of which will be included in future papers .",
    "in addition , we have a _ hubble space telescope _",
    "cycle 17 program to image the host galaxies of the agns in this sample , allowing us to correct their spectroscopic luminosities for starlight and apply these new results to the low end of the radius  luminosity relationship for agns @xcite , which is the primary calibration for all single - epoch mass estimates for broad - lined agns .",
