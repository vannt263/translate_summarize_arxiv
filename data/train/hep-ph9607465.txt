    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the leading candidate models@xcite for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in this theory ,",
    "one begins with the sm particles ( but with two higgs doublets to ultimately ensure anomaly cancellation ) ; supersymmetrization then leads to partner particles for each sm particle which differ by spin-@xmath4 .",
    "supersymmetry breaking is implemented by adding explicit soft supersymmetry breaking terms .",
    "this procedure leads to a particle physics model with @xmath5 free parameters , which ought to be valid at the weak scale .    to reduce the number of free parameters , one needs a theory of how the soft susy breaking terms arise , _",
    "i.e. _ , how supersymmetry is broken . in the minimal supergravity model ( sugra)@xcite ,",
    "supersymmetry is spontaneously broken via a hidden sector field vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and the susy breaking is communicated to the visible sector via gravitational interactions . for a flat khler",
    "metric and common gauge kinetic functions , this leads to a common scalar mass @xmath6 , a common gaugino mass @xmath7 , and common trilinear and bilinear terms @xmath8 and @xmath9 at some high scale @xmath10 , where the former choice is usually taken due to apparent gauge coupling unification at @xmath11 gev .",
    "the high scale mass terms and couplings are then linked to weak - scale values via renormalization group evolution .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite , which is hidden at high scales , is then induced by the large top - quark yukawa coupling , which drives one of the higgs field masses to a negative value .",
    "minimization of the scalar potential allows one to effectively replace @xmath12 by @xmath13 and express the magnitude ( but not the sign ) of the higgsino mass @xmath14 in terms of @xmath15 .",
    "the resulting parameter space of this model is thus usually given by the set ( @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) .",
    "not all values of the above @xmath18 dimensional parameter space of the minimal sugra model are allowed .",
    "for instance , the top and bottom yukawa couplings are driven to infinity somewhere between @xmath15 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( depending on the value of @xmath22)@xcite .",
    "for other parameter choices , the lightest chargino or lightest slepton ( or top squark ) can be the lightest susy particle , which would violate limits on , for instance , heavy exotic nuclei . for yet other parameter choices , electroweak symmetry breaking leads to the wrong value of @xmath15 , so these parameter choices are ruled out .",
    "in addition , there are cosmological bounds from the relic density of neutralinos produced in the big bang@xcite . requiring the universe to be older than @xmath23 billion years leads to only a subset of the parameter space being allowed , although this bound could be evaded by allowing for a small amount of r - parity violation .",
    "finally , certain regions of parameter space are rejected by negative searches for sparticles at colliding beam experiments , such as those at lep and the fermilab tevatron@xcite .",
    "an additional constraint on minimal sugra parameters can be obtained by requiring that the global minimum of the scalar potential is indeed the minimum that leads to appropriate electroweak symmetry breaking . in the sm",
    ", there is only a single direction in the field space of the scalar potential , so appropriate electroweak symmetry breaking can be assured . for the mssm",
    ", the plethora of new scalar fields which are introduced leads to many possible directions in field space where minima could develop which are deeper than the standard minimum .",
    "thus , parameter choices which lead to deeper minima should be excluded as well , since they would lead to a universe with a non - standard vacuum .",
    "constraints along the preceeding lines were developed in refs.@xcite in the early 1980 s , using the renormalization group improved tree level effective potential .",
    "it was noted by gamberini _ et .",
    "al._@xcite that the renormalization group improved tree potential was subject to large variations due to uncertainty in the correct scale choice @xmath24 at which it was evaluated .",
    "inclusion of 1-loop corrections served to ameliorate this condition .",
    "recently , casas , lleyda , and muoz@xcite have made a systematic survey of all possible dangerous directions in scalar field space that can potentially lead to minima deeper than the standard one .",
    "these have been categorized as field directions that are either unbounded from below ( at tree level ) ( ufb ) or that lead to charge or color - breaking ( ccb ) minima . for simplicity",
    ", their analysis uses the tree - level scalar potential but evaluated at an optimized mass scale where 1-loop corrections ought to be only a small effect . working within the minimal sugra model , they considered models with @xmath25 or @xmath26 and showed that significant regions of parameter space could be excluded via this method .    in the present work , one of our main goals is to delineate the parameter space regions where non - standard potential minima develop in such a manner as to facilitate comparisons with other constraints , including recently calculated results on the neutralino relic density@xcite and parameter space regions favored by fine - tuning considerations@xcite .",
    "in addition , expectations for supersymmetry at lep2@xcite , the tevatron mi and tev33 upgrades@xcite , the lhc@xcite , and nlc@xcite have been calculated within the minimal sugra framework .",
    "we also compare the non - standard vacuum constraints with the various collider expectations and draw some conclusions .",
    "for instance , combining the non - standard vacuum constraints with the most favored parameter space regions from fine - tuning and cosmology suggests that the fermilab tev33 upgrade stands a high chance to discover susy via the @xmath27 signal !    in the present work , we also adopt a somewhat different calculational scheme from that employed in ref .",
    "for all field directions considered , we implement renormalization group ( rg ) improvement to calculate the 1-loop effective potential .",
    "we find that the inclusion of the 1-loop correction has important consequences .",
    "the 1-loop correction almost always represents a significant contribution to the tree level potential .",
    "nevertheless , our overall results agree very well with those of @xcite for a `` proper '' choice in rg improvement scheme . for reference , we shall call this the `` @xmath28-case , '' and it represents our main results .",
    "however , for other choices of rg improvement , we find that the 1-loop correction can be so dominant as to lead to unbounded from below ( ufb ) potentials everywhere in parameter space : we refer to this as the `` @xmath29-case . '' because this is a multi - scale problem , it is not entirely clear how to proceed with rg improvement , and it is this ambiguity that leads to the two cases above .",
    "the validity of our results hinge on two main assumptions .",
    "the first concerns the adequacy of cutting the expansion at 1-loop .",
    "it is beyond the present analysis to ascertain the significance of the 2-loop contribution in any of the cases considered .",
    "however , because of the dependence of our results on the details of rg improvement , we believe that the 2-loop contribution may be important .",
    "secondly , we have only included the contribution of the top - stop sector in our calculations of the 1-loop correction .",
    "it remains to be determined if the inclusion of the other fields will significantly affect the results .",
    "we note briefly that the work of @xcite and @xcite advances the idea that we may indeed exist in a false vacuum and that the tunnelling rate from our present vacuum to a ufb or ccb vacuum might be small relative to the age of the universe . in this case",
    ", the following derived constraints would not be meaningful .",
    "such a philosophy must , however , be reconciled@xcite with the fact that we live in a world in which the cosmological constant either vanishes or is extremely small .",
    "this is empirical , albeit indirect , evidence for some mechanism which seeks to enforce the principle that  the cosmological constant of the true vacuum is zero . \"",
    "it is difficult to conceive of circumstances where we could tenably entertain both the idea that we are living in a false vacuum and the idea that the smallness of the cosmological constant has a natural solution , since this would require a principle which would set the cosmological constant to zero in a false , broken vacuum while simultaneously leaving the true , broken vacuum with a large negative cosmological constant .",

    "furthermore , the choice in minimization scale being in the @xmath15 range is dictated by the desired vacuum expectation value and is validated by the use of the 1-loop correction .",
    "unfortunately , this method does not lend itself to the present task , since _ a priori _ the minimum of the potential in a given configuration is unknown .",
    "the task is complicated since we must be able to probe the potential for significantly different field values .    in order to validate the use of the 1-loop effective potential",
    ", one must ensure that not only the couplings be perturbative but that the logarithms be small as well .",
    "this is the process of rg improvement @xcite . in problems with only one mass scale ,",
    "rg improvement is straightforward .",
    "the logarithm appearing in the 1-loop correction can be made small , indeed to vanish , for any choice in field value by an appropriate choice in renormalization scale @xmath24 .",
    "this procedure yields the @xmath24-independent , 1-loop rg improved potential . for the cases in which we are interested , there are several mass scales .",
    "since in general no scale exists that simultaneously makes all the logarithms vanish , we settle for the scale at which the logarithms are simultaneously , optimally small . in this way",
    ", we construct the 1-loop effective potential .",
    "note that in such cases the 1-loop correction does not vanish and indeed may represent a significant contribution to the tree level part . in our subsequent results",
    ", we always include the 1-loop correction in our evaluation of the effective potential .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates the significance of the 1-loop correction for a representative case with @xmath86 , @xmath87 gev , @xmath88 gev , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 . in this example , we have employed the @xmath28-scheme ( see below ) for rg improvement . from fig .",
    "1_b _ we see that the difference between the value of the tree potential at the minimum and the 1-loop effective potential in the ufb-3(a ) direction is almost a factor of four .",
    "there is also an effect in the standard mssm direction as seen in fig .",
    "1_a_. this particular point in parameter space is ruled out since @xmath91 .",
    "we implement the rg improvement procedure as follows : ( 1 ) at each rg scale @xmath24 find the field value @xmath92 that minimizes the function @xmath93 ^ 2\\ , \\label{eq3.1}\\ ] ] ( 2 ) store this value and the corresponding @xmath94 .",
    "this results in the function @xmath95 whose minimum can then be calculated .",
    "given the standard numerical procedure involved in rg studies , in which runge - kutta routines are used to integrate over @xmath24 , the above procedure of finding the optimal @xmath92 at each scale @xmath24 is the most efficient , since we construct the rg improved potential simultaneously as we evolve the rg parameters of the mssm . also , we note that including @xmath96 coefficients in @xmath97 ( as they appear in @xmath98 ) leads to pathological results .",
    "namely , at all scales @xmath24 , the @xmath99-minimizing field value tends to zero .",
    "this is a pathology of the method we are employing .",
    "had we instead fixed @xmath92 and found the @xmath99-minimizing value of @xmath24 , this problem would not be present .",
    "because of the ambiguities in rg improvement in multi - scale problems , we examined several prescriptions for constructing the effective potential .",
    "( 2.9 ) with @xmath100 led to the @xmath28-case .",
    "we also tried @xmath101 .",
    "we used the functional form @xmath102 , and tried the top and stop masses as possible choices for @xmath103 .",
    "all of these choices led to the @xmath29-case . in this case , the potentials along the ufb-3(b ) and ccb(a)-up directions were unbounded from below everywhere in parameter space .",
    "although this result is interesting , we believe that 2-loop leading logarithms may remedy this curious situation . therefore we discount these results for the moment . along all other directions considered , the @xmath29-results were similar to the @xmath28-results as one expects .",
    "figure 2 displays results in the @xmath29-case similar to fig .",
    "1 . comparing figs .  1 and 2 , the 1-loop effective potentials are essentially identical for the mssm direction . and although the ufb-3(a ) potentials are clearly different , the @xmath29 potential in this direction remains well - behaved .",
    "figure 3 displays the logarithm of the vev versus @xmath104 in two vacuum directions . in the ufb-3(a )",
    "direction , there is some minor change in the vev but not very significant as @xmath104 varies from the @xmath28 to @xmath29 value . in constrast ,",
    "the vev suffers a drastic , discontinuous jump at around @xmath105 in the ccb(a)-up direction .",
    "this same discontinuity occurs in the ufb-3(b ) case .    from fig .",
    "3 , we see that altering @xmath104 ( which effectively changes our @xmath24 choice ) changes our results dramatically in the ccb(a)-up and ufb-3(b ) directions .",
    "these two directions are special in that their 1-loop contributions are dominant in the large vev domain .",
    "this comes in particular from contributions to the stop masses by the @xmath106 terms ( see ( a.19 - 20,25 - 26 ) ) ; bear in mind that the quadratic ( or @xmath107 ) contributions in @xmath108 are always small or zero . for these cases , in the large vev domain , the 1-loop correction , @xmath98 , is obviously unstable against @xmath24 . for the case depicted in fig .  3 , we have verified that @xmath109 has a large , negative slope and changes sign at @xmath110 gev , leading to a potential which is very unstable against variations in scale choice .",
    "we assume this instability is due to a need to include higher terms in the effective potential for these cases .",
    "it is interesting to note that the standard procedure for computing the mssm minimum gives results that differ , sometimes greatly , from the above rg improved procedure .",
    "we find that the 1-loop correction to the mssm potential does a poor job of stabilizing the potential against @xmath24 near @xmath15 .",
    "this was alluded to in @xcite .",
    "the result is surprising given the conventional lore that the 1-loop correction stabilizes the potential in the electroweak range .",
    "a more detailed study of this issue is in progress . in fig .  4",
    ", we demonstrate the problem by displaying the @xmath24 evolution of the vev using two different methods in the case @xmath86 , @xmath111 gev , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "the solid line represents the evolution as dictated by the rg gamma functions of the higgs fields ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed line represents the tracking of the minimum of the 1-loop effective potential .",
    "here we have included the contributions from _ all _ particles in @xmath98 .    for all cases ,",
    "we have explored the dangerous directions delineated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; these directions were obtained using only the tree level potential .",
    "a better procedure would involve optimization of the full 1-loop effective potential .",
    "this may in principle lead to even more precipitous directions .",
    "however , since this procedure leads to very unwieldy expressions , we have opted to explore the tree - level - derived directions in field space , although in these directions we make comparisons using the 1-loop corrected scalar potential .",
    "we emphasize the importance of using the 1-loop correction to the scalar potential , since its inclusion can alter the depth of the minimum significantly as was evident in fig .",
    "1_b_. furthermore , the startling results of the @xmath29-case were a consequence of using the 1-loop correction to compute the potential .",
    "had the 1-loop correction been ignored , all choices of rg improvement we tried would have led to results similar to @xcite .",
    "figure 5_a _ shows the potential along the ccb(a)-up direction ( in the case @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ) using only the tree level potential .",
    "this point would have been excluded by the ccb(a)-up constraint since @xmath112 . however , including the 1-loop correction in this case leads to the potential displayed in fig .",
    "5_b_. it appears unbounded from below as last seen at field values nearing the planck scale in the @xmath29-case thus also ruling out this point .",
    "however , in the same figure , the @xmath28-case 1-loop effective potential is not unbounded from below and indeed does not rule out this point ( in this direction ) .",
    "using the procedures outlined in sec .",
    "iii and appendices a and b , we explored regions of minimal sugra parameter space for minima deeper than the standard mssm one .",
    "our initial scans took place in the @xmath113 plane , to facilitate comparison with recent results on fine - tuning , cosmology and present and future collider searches .",

    "@xcite leads to nearly identical excluded regions .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "6 that for all four frames , the region of low @xmath6 becomes excluded . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this rules out the so - called `` no - scale '' models which require @xmath121 .",
    "in addition , in string models where supersymmetry is broken in the dilaton sector , one is led to gut or string scale soft - terms related by @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "for this precise choice of soft - term boundary conditions , much of the parameter space is excluded by non - standard minima .",
    "we further note that the excluded region rules out much of the sugra parameter space associated with light sleptons .",
    "in particular , taken literally , our results exclude regions where such decays as @xmath123 and @xmath124 take place .    although fig .  6 is plotted for @xmath86 , a similar excluded region results for other choices of the @xmath8 parameter .",
