    "a much - debated issue in recent years is the question of universality of the five - dimensional ising model  @xcite .",
    "this question focuses on the value of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath3 at criticality , which is related to the binder cumulant @xmath4  @xcite . for @xmath5-dimensional systems with periodic boundary conditions , hypercubic geometry and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the upper critical dimension ,",
    "renormalization theory  @xcite predicts that this cumulant has a universal value .",
    "however , although @xmath8 for ising models with short - range couplings , monte carlo simulations  @xcite for five - dimensional ising systems with linear sizes @xmath9 suggested a different value for @xmath4 .",
    "large - scale simulations for @xmath10  @xcite corroborated the earlier monte carlo result .",
    "as this controversy might indicate a problem with the renormalization analysis , various efforts were undertaken to gain additional insight in the nature of the discrepancy .",
    "first , simulations were carried out for a closely - related class of systems , namely low - dimensional systems with algebraically decaying interactions  @xcite . provided that these long - range interactions decay sufficiently slowly , they induce classical critical behaviour even in one - dimensional systems .",
    "thus they effectively lower the upper critical dimension .",
    "as these systems are described by the same renormalization equations as high - dimensional short - range models , the same discrepancy in the binder cumulant could be observable .",
    "the advantage of examining these long - range systems is their lower dimensionality , which makes it possible to simulate a much larger range of system sizes .",
    "it might seem that this advantage is undone by the increase of simulation time due to the larger number of interacting neighbours , which constitutes the very reason for the mean - field like behaviour .",
    "however , this latter problem was avoided by a cluster algorithm for long - range interactions in which the simulation time is independent of the number of interacting spins  @xcite .",
    "the binder cumulant was shown to agree accurately with the theoretical prediction for all examined systems with @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this did not completely resolve the existing discrepancy , as the relation between models with long - range interactions and high - dimensional short - range ising models is non - exact .",
    "two subsequent studies actually were concerned with the five - dimensional model itself .",
    "mon  @xcite studied the finite - size behaviour of the first and third absolute magnetization moments ( normalized by the second moment to render them dimensionless ) , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and found that the monte carlo results for these quantities agreed well with the theoretically expected values .",
    "furthermore , he showed that the finite - size corrections for the fourth moment  which is directly related to the binder cumulant  are much larger than for the first and third one , which might explain the previously found disagreement .",
    "the only point of discussion concerning this study was the nature of the dominant finite - size correction , see refs .",
    "next , parisi and ruiz - lorenzo  @xcite carried out monte carlo simulations for the five - dimensional ising model using the wolff cluster algorithm , which implied a considerable improvement compared to previous studies .",
    "they also introduced a new quantity , namely the binder cumulant evaluated at the `` apparent critical temperature '' , defined as the ( size - dependent ) temperature where the connected susceptibility takes its maximum .",
    "they showed their monte carlo results for this quantity , taken at @xmath15 , to agree well with the mean - field value .",
    "unfortunately , the statistical accuracy of the numerical results for the binder cumulant at the critical temperature was not sufficient to allow an extrapolation to the @xmath16 limit , so that the original controversy could not be settled yet .",
    "in this paper we present new monte carlo results for the five - dimensional ising model . we have carried out simulations for hypercubic systems up to linear size @xmath0 , which corresponds to more than @xmath17 spins .",
    "periodic boundaries were employed .",
    "the results have a high statistical accuracy , which is required to resolve the various finite - size corrections .",
    "the majority of the results were obtained on a cray t3e massively parallel computer at delft university .",
    "a total amount of 4000 ( one - processor ) cpu - hours was invested .",
    "one quarter of the total time was spent on the two largest system sizes , @xmath18 . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used the wolff cluster algorithm  @xcite to suppress critical slowing down .",
    "samples were taken at intervals containing a number of wolff steps approximately equal to the inverse of the average relative cluster size .",
    "table  [ tab : simul ] gives the details for the various system sizes .",
    ".details of the monte carlo simulations .",
    "the table shows both the number of wolff clusters per sample and the total number of samples taken for each system size . [ cols= \" > ,",
    "> , > \" , ]",
    "in this paper we have presented numerical results for the five - dimensional ising model , in particular for the binder cumulant and the critical coupling . using accurate results for relatively large system sizes",
    "we have been able to carry out a detailed analysis of the various corrections to scaling .",
    "the results are in full agreement with the predictions of renormalization theory and hence resolve the long - standing discrepancy for the binder cumulant .",
    "furthermore , we reinforced our earlier suggestion that this discrepancy was caused by the neglect of higher - order finite - size corrections .",
    "a more elaborate analysis of the critical properties of the five - dimensional ising model will be presented elsewhere .",
