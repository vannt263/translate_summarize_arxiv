    "initial data for the einstein equations is usually constructed by the conformal method .",
    "one is given ` free ' data and rescales it to get the physical initial data .",
    "this is necessary because the einstein initial data has constraints .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the constraints can be found in @xcite , especially in chapter vii .",
    "interesting physics tends to occur at the boundaries of the space of free data : one gets at the very least some insight into the limitations of the conformal method .",
    "the free data consists of a ` base ' metric , a riemannian 3-metric , a divergence - free , trace - free symmetric tensor ( a tt tensor ) , and a scalar which is the trace of the extrinsic curvature .",
    "if the domain is a compact manifold without boundary we often choose the scalar as a constant .",
    "we then use a conformal transformation to solve the constraints .",
    "if neither the tt tensor nor the constant vanish , we can always find the appropriate conformal factor @xcite .",
    "parts of the boundary of the free data are easily accesible .",
    "we can scale any one of the three parts by multiplying it by a constant and letting the constant become either large or small .",
    "what effect has this on the physics ?",
    "for example , does the solution just cease to exist , does the volume of the spacetime blow up ( or shrink to zero ) , do apparent horizons ( which may be interpreted as cosmological horizons ) appear ?",
    "maxwell s equations also have constrained initial data . by choosing the maxwell free data as a pair of 3-vectors , @xmath0",
    ", a parallel can be seen between the two fields .",
    "the magnetic and electric fields can be generated via @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a scalar function chosen to satisfy @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that if we multiply either @xmath5 or @xmath6 by any constant , @xmath7 or @xmath8 will be multiplied by the same amount . as a result",
    ", this kind of rescaling can be used to increase the electromagnetic energy density @xmath9 without limit .",
    "can we perform such a rescaling in general relativity ?",
    "can we increase the gravitational wave energy at will by multiplying any part of the free data by a large constant ? because the gravitational wave energy interacts in a very nonlinear way with the geometry , it is not clear what happens with the einstein equations .    in this article",
    ", we discuss one such rescaling of the gravitational free data .",
    "the initial data consists of a 3-metric , @xmath10 , and a symmetric tensor , @xmath11 which is the extrinsic curvature of the slice .",
    "this is essentially the velocity of the 3-metric .",
    "@xmath11 is generated from the tt tensor and the constant .",
    "the constant is the hubble constant , it represents a uniform expansion or contraction of the space , while the tt tensor ( which has only 2 degrees of freedom per space point ) can be interpreted as the gravitational wave velocity .",
    "we multiply the term that represents the gravitational wave velocity by a large number and track the solution .",
    "it turns out that the local energy density remains constant , while the volume of the universe expands .",
    "this article is a combination of analytic and numerical works .",
    "although we study a highly nonlinear elliptic equation , nevertheless we obtain some interesting analytical results .",
    "in addition , we can accurately solve the equation numerically .",
    "this numerical work not only confirms the analytic results , where available , but also indicates the behaviour of solutions in situations where we can not prove anything .",
    "in section ii we confine ourselves to describing the conformal method of solving the constraints . in section iii",
    "we show that if the extrinsic curvature vanishes nowhere on a compact manifold and we increase it , the conformal factor uniformly blows up",
    ". however , when the extrinsic curvature vanishes somewhere , the analysis in section iii is no longer valid . to investigate this special case",
    ", we revert to a spherically symmetric toy model , deriving some analytic results in section iv and showing the numerical work in section v. we distinguish between data sets where the extrinsic curvature vanishes in finite regions and when it only vanishes at an isolated point . here",
    "we supply strong evidence that we do not get blow - up in regions of vanishing extrinsic curvature , and that we get slow blow - up when the extrinsic curvature vanishes at an isolated point .",
    "we conclude with a summary and an outline of future work .",
    "initial data for the einstein equations consists of two parts : the first part is a manifold equipped with a riemannian 3-metric @xmath10 , and the second is a symmetric tensor @xmath11 on the same manifold .",
    "@xmath11 is the extrinsic curvature of the 3-slice , i.e. , the time derivative of the 3-geometry .",
    "the metric and extrinsic curvature can not be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "they must satisfy two constraints : the first is the hamiltonian constraint , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 3-scalar curvature of @xmath10 and @xmath14 is the trace of @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath15 . the second , the so - called momentum constraint , is @xmath16 the terminology and notation comes from @xcite .",
    "the standard way of generating solutions to these equations is by means of a conformal transformation . on any given manifold",
    ", it is easy to construct tt tensors @xcite .",
    "these are tensors that are both tracefree and divergencefree , @xmath17 .",
    "such @xmath18 tensors are conformally covariant . if one multiplies the given base metric @xmath10 by an arbitrary positive function @xmath19 to construct a new metric , @xmath20 , then @xmath21 is tt with respect to @xmath22 . @xcite    any @xmath11 which is the sum of a @xmath18 part and a constant trace , i.e. , @xmath23 , where @xmath14 is a constant , satisfies the momentum constraint eq.([m ] ) .",
    "if we make a conformal tranformation of the metric , @xmath20 , we find that @xmath24 again satisfies the momentum constraint with respect to the new metric .",
    "note that @xmath14 is not transformed ; rather , it remains a given constant . in the conformal method",
    ", one uses the fact that we can freely choose the conformal factor to solve the hamiltonian constraint .    if we conformally transform the metric , @xmath20 , we find that the scalar curvature transforms as @xmath25 we want the final metric and the final extrinsic curvature to satisfy the hamiltonian constraint eq.([h ] ) , @xmath26 .",
    "this reduces to the famous lichnerowicz - york equation @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "this equation is very well behaved @xcite . in this article",
    "we focus on the situation where the topology of the 3-manifold is compact and without boundary .",
    "it can be shown that eq.([ly ] ) has a unique positive solution if @xmath29 and if @xmath30 is not identically zero .",
    "it need not be non - zero everywhere ; it is enough that it not vanish somewhere @xcite .",
    "let us remind the reader that @xmath14 is a constant , while @xmath30 is a function . in the special cases , where either @xmath31 or @xmath32 , we have an extra condition related to the sign of the scalar curvature .",
    "however , in the general case no such restriction applies .",
    "this existence result does not depend either on the metric , other than it be uniformly elliptic , or on the topology of the 3-manifold .    to recapitulate : we start with a triplet , i.e. , the free data , @xmath33 , and construct a new set @xmath34 that satisfies the constraints .",
    "we would like to investigate the boundary of the set of free data .",
    "there exist parts of the boundary that are easy to reach .",
    "we can change the original triplet in a simple way by multiplying any one of them by a constant without touching the other two , because , for example , multiplying a tt tensor by a constant does not change its ttness with respect to a fixed metric .",
    "of course , such a transformation will change the solution , @xmath19 , of eq.([ly ] ) , and thus the data satisfying the constraints will be different .    in this article",
    "we will consider such a rescaling .",
    "we pick one triplet @xmath33 , and use it to construct a family of free data of the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a running parameter . in particular , we wish to focus attention on the behaviour of @xmath19 as @xmath36 becomes large in order to see what happens to the physical initial data that emerges .",
    "this is a particularly interesting part of the boundary .",
    "one can regard @xmath30 as the velocity of the gravitational waves coded into the initial data .",
    "this rescaling seems to push up the gravitational wave energy content of the free data .",
    "therefore , we are trying to increase the gravitational wave energy while controlling the rest of the geometry as much as we can .",
    "in the special case where @xmath30 vanishes nowhere , we can show that the conformal factor uniformly blows up .",
    "we demonstrate this in the next section .",
    "we want to look at eq.([ly ] ) @xmath37 where @xmath28 .",
    "we are interested in the situation where we scale @xmath38 by a constant @xmath39",
    ". therefore we look at @xmath40 and we wish to show that @xmath19 scales linearly with @xmath36 as @xmath36 becomes large . we write @xmath41 and then eq.([ly1 ] ) becomes @xmath42 we wish to solve the family of equations on a compact manifold without boundary .",
    "it turns out that the sign of the scalar curvature plays a minor role in the behaviour of the solutions .",
    "we can always set the scalar curvature to a constant value because of the yamabe theorem @xcite , which tells us that any riemannian metric on a compact manifold can be conformally transformed to a metric of constant scalar curvature ( this really only makes sense on a compact manifold ) .",
    "the key quantity is the yamabe number @xmath43dv}{[\\int \\theta^6 dv]^{1/3}},\\ ] ] where the infimum is taken over all smooth functions , @xmath44 .",
    "the sign of the yamabe number fixes the sign of the constant scalar curvature . since eq.([ly2 ] ) is conformally covariant , and since conformal transformations form a group under composition , we can set @xmath13 to a constant value without losing any generality .",
    "however , we do need to handle the three separate cases , @xmath45 and @xmath46 independently . in each case",
    "we will set the value of @xmath47 .",
    "this choice does not change in any fundamental way the behaviour of the solution .",
    "we assume that we are in the positive yamabe class and set the scalar curvature @xmath49 ; the specific number can be chosen freely .",
    "now eq.([ly2 ] ) reduces to @xmath50 eq.([ly3 ] ) , because it is just a rescaled version of the original lichnerowicz - york equation eq.([ly ] ) , which is extremely well behaved , has a regular positive solution .",
    "let us look at what happens at the maximum of @xmath51 , which we shall assume occurs at a point @xmath52 .",

    "we display the various solutions in figure 7 , showing the normalized @xmath181 on @xmath151 .",
    "the parameters used are @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 .",
    "these correspond to the red , green , blue , pink , light blue , yellow , dark blue , and mauve lines respectively on figure 7 .     on @xmath151 , width=264,height=188 ]",
    "one can clearly see that the value of @xmath109 , on the support of @xmath56 , tends to a stationary limit , while @xmath109 collapses off the support of @xmath56 .",
    "this shows that @xmath19 scales linearly with @xmath36 , on the support of @xmath56 , while in the region where @xmath56 is zero , @xmath109 continues to diminish so that @xmath19 approaches a stationary value .",
    "we wish to show that @xmath190 increases with @xmath36 but approaches some fixed upper bound .",
    "the minimum occurs around @xmath191 . in figure 8",
    "we have plotted @xmath192 versus @xmath36 at @xmath191 .",
    "one should compare this graph with figures 4 and 5 .",
    "this looks like a graph which is going to an asymptotic value of 0 , which indicates that @xmath19 , at @xmath191 , is heading for a fixed number , independent of @xmath36 .",
    "vs @xmath36 , width=264,height=188 ]",
    "we have shown that if we scale @xmath193 by @xmath39 , we find that the conformal factor , in general , scales like @xmath36",
    ". however , the physical @xmath194 , and as @xmath36 becomes larger and larger @xmath195 remains finite .",
    "this means that @xmath196 remains finite .",
    "hence the velocity part of the gravitational wave energy density remains bounded even though the corresponding ` free ' data blows up . on the other hand ,",
    "the volume of space becomes unboundedly large , because @xmath197 blows up .",
    "therefore the total gravitational wave energy in a coordinate sphere becomes larger and larger while the local energy density remains bounded .",
    "we see that the gravitational wave energy inside any coordinate sphere increases like @xmath198 while the surface area increases like @xmath199 .",
    "this indicates that this family of initial data will eventually contain horizons .",
    "the numerics , when combined with the analytic calculations , show a coherent picture .",
    "if @xmath200 has no zeros , then the conformal factor blows up uniformly .",
    "if the @xmath200 is zero on a patch , we expect no blow up on this patch , but , nevertheless , we continue to get the standard blowup elsewhere",
    ". if @xmath200 has an isolated zero , we will get blowup at this point , but at a rate slower than in the rest of the space .",
    "the rate of blowup is not universal in this case , but depends on how quickly @xmath200 moves away from zero at that point .",
    "there seems to be a smooth transition between the ` slow blow - up ' case and the ` no blow - up ' case .",
    "there are a number of obvious extensions to this work . to find a real @xmath18 tensor",
    ", we need to abandon spherical symmetry and , at the very least , work with axially symmetric data .",
    "we would expect that if we have a real @xmath200 , which either vanishes at a point or vanishes in a region , to get behaviour similar to the spherical model",
    ". we would be surprised if anything could be proven analytically ; we are going to have to depend on numerical modeling .",
    "work is in progress in this direction",
    ".    it would be interesting to repeat this analysis in the asymptotically flat case",
    ". we would probably want to work with maximal initial data , i.e. , @xmath31 , and just have a metric and a @xmath18 tensor as free data .",
    "it is clear that one can change the metric so that the adm mass becomes unboundedly large and trapped surfaces appear @xcite . what happens if we blow - up the extrinsic curvature on a fixed background metric ?",
    "will we get the same behaviour ?",
    "preliminary investigations indicate that we do : the adm mass diverges and trapped surfaces appear .",
