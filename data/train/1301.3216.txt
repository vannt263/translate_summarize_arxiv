    "in recent years , the camassa - holm ( ch ) equation @xcite @xmath1 ( @xmath2 is an arbitrary constant ) derived by camassa and holm @xcite as a shallow water wave model , has caught much attention and various studies .",
    "the ch equation admits lax representation @xcite , bi - hamiltonian structures @xcite,@xcite , and is integrable by the inverse scattering transformation @xcite .",
    "also it possesses multi - peakon solutions @xcite and algebro - geometric solutions @xcite .",
    "the most interesting feature of the ch equation is : admitting peaked soliton ( peakon ) solutions in the case of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a peakon is a weak solution in some sobolev space with corner at its crest .",
    "the stability and interaction of peakons were discussed in several references @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition to the ch equation , other integrable models with peakon solutions have been found , such as the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation @xcite@xmath4 the cubic nonlinear peakon equation or modified ch equation @xcite @xmath5_x , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{mch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the novikov s cubic nonlinear equation @xcite @xmath6 and a generalized ch equation with both quadratic and cubic nonlinearity @xcite @xmath7_x+\\frac{1}{2}k_2(2 m u_x+ m_xu ) , \\quad   m = u - u_{xx},\\label{gch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two arbitrary constants .",
    "the interesting characteristics of the ch equation stimulated more people to study peakon , cuspon , and weak kink solutions to enrich the theory of soliton and integrable systems .",
    "one of important tasks is to seek for integrable multi - component peakon systems with amazing integrable properties and applications .",
    "for example , the integrable two - component ch equation are proposed in @xcite .",
    "the integrable two - component forms of the cubic peakon equation ( [ mch ] ) are presented in @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a more generalized version of the integrable two - component peakon system as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two arbitrary functions of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and their derivatives satisfying @xmath15 as @xmath16 ( [ geq ] ) is reduced to the ch equation ( [ ch ] ) . as @xmath17 ( [ geq ] )",
    "is reduced to the cubic peakon equation ( [ mch ] ) . as @xmath18 ( [ geq ] )",
    "is reduced to the generalized ch equation ( [ gch ] ) .",
    "thus , equation ( [ geq ] ) is a kind of two - component generalizations of equation ( [ ch ] ) , ( [ mch ] ) and ( [ gch ] ) .",
    "we show that the two - component model ( [ geq ] ) is integrable in the sense of lax pair and infinitely many conservation laws . by choosing @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is an arbitrary polynomial in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and their derivatives ,",
    "we may obtain quite a large number of integrable two - component systems with peakon solutions . as examples , the bi - hamiltonian structures and the peakon interactions of some integrable two - component systems",
    "are discussed in detail . in the paper",
    ", we also study some reductions from the two - component model and obtain very interesting solutions , such as new type of @xmath0-peakon solutions , @xmath0-weak - kink solutions , weak hat - shape soliton solutions , periodic - peakon solutions , and rational peakon solutions .",
    "in particular , we first time propose new type of @xmath0-peakon solutions which are not in the traveling wave type , @xmath0-weak - kink solutions , weak hat - shape soliton solutions , and rational peakon solutions whose feature looks very like the so - called rogue wave @xcite .",
    "let us consider a pair of @xmath22 matrix spectral problems of the following type @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are arbitrary polynomials in @xmath13 , @xmath14 and their derivatives satisfying the constraint ( [ cd ] ) .",

    "thus , ( [ lps ] ) and ( [ lpt ] ) compose of a lax pair of equation ( [ geq ] ) .",

    ", we expand @xmath29 in terms of negative powers of @xmath36 as below : @xmath37 substituting ( [ oe1 ] ) into ( [ ric ] ) and equating the coefficients of powers of @xmath36 , we arrive at @xmath38,\\quad j\\geq 1 .",

    "a new integrable system with new type of peakon solutions *    taking @xmath44 in equation ( [ gteq ] ) gives rise to the following integrable two - component model @xmath45 this model can be rewritten as the following bi - hamiltonian form @xmath46 where @xmath47    let us assume that ( [ teqh0 ] ) has the following one - peakon solution @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are functions of @xmath52 needed to be determined . substituting ( [ teqh0op ] ) into ( [ teqh0 ] ) and integrating against the test function with support around the peak , we obtain @xmath53 which yields @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are integration constants .",

    "so , we find a new integrable peakon system ( [ teqh0 ] ) whose peakon solution is not in traveling wave type .",
    "see figure [ f11 ] for the profile of the new single - peakon solution .",
    "let us suppose the @xmath0-peakon solution in the form of @xmath60 substituting ( [ np ] ) into ( [ teqh0 ] ) and integrating against test functions , we obtain the @xmath0-peakon dynamic system of ( [ teqh0 ] ) : @xmath61 in the above formula , @xmath62 implies that the peak position does not change along with the time @xmath52 .",

    "* although equations ( [ teqhuv1 ] ) and ( [ teqhuv2 ] ) share the same bi - hamiltonian operators with different hamiltonian functions , their peakon dynamics are very different . in the single - peakon case ,",
