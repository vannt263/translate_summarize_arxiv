    "random matrix theory as a statistical approach for exploring properties of complex quantum systems was pioneered by wigner and dyson half a century ago @xcite .",
    "this theory was successfully applied to excited states of complex nuclei and other mesoscopic systems @xcite , evaluating statistical fluctuations and correlations of energy levels and corresponding wave functions supposedly of  chaotic \" nature .",
    "the standard random matrix approach based on the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) for systems with time - reversal invariance , and on the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) if this invariance is violated , was formulated originally for _ closed _ systems with no coupling to the outside world .",
    "although the practical studies of complex nuclei , atoms , disordered solids , or microwave cavities always require the use of reactions produced by external sources , the typical assumption was that such a probe at the resonance is sensitive to the specific components of the exceedingly complicated intrinsic wave function , one for each open reaction channel , and the resonance widths are measuring the weights of these components @xcite . with the gaussian distribution of independent amplitudes in a chaotic intrinsic wave function ,",
    "the widths under this assumption are proportional to the squares of the amplitudes and as such can be described , for @xmath2 independent open channels , by the chi - square distribution with @xmath2 degrees of freedom . for low - energy elastic scattering of neutrons off heavy nuclei , where the interactions can be considered time - reversal invariant , one expects @xmath3 that is usually called the porter - thomas distribution ( ptd ) @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    recent measurements @xcite claimed that the neutron width distributions in low - energy neutron resonances on certain heavy nuclei are different from the ptd . as a rule , the fraction of greater widths is increased , while the fraction of narrow resonances is reduced which , being approximately presented with the aid of the same standard class of functions , would require @xmath4 .",
    "the literature discussing the scattering and decay processes in chaotic systems , see for example @xcite and references therein , does not provide a detailed description of the width distribution for the region of relatively small widths as observed in low - energy neutron resonances .",
    "there are various reasons for possible deviations from the simple statistical predictions @xcite .",
    "first of all , the intrinsic dynamics , even in heavy nuclei , can be different from that in the goe limit of many - body quantum chaos .",
    "if so , the detailed analysis of specific nuclei is required .",
    "as an example we can mention @xmath5th , where for a long time a _ sign problem",
    "_ exists @xcite concerning the resonances with strong enhancement of parity non - conservation in scattering of longitudinally polarized neutrons .",
    "the observed predominance of a certain sign of parity violating asymmetry contradicts to the statistical mechanism of the effect and may be related to the non - random coupling between quadrupole and octupole degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the width distribution in the same nucleus reveals noticeable deviations from the ptd .",
    "the presence of a shell - model single - particle resonance serving as a doorway to the compound nucleus can also make its footprint distorting the statistical pattern .",
    "another ( maybe related to the doorway resonance ) effect can come from the changed energy dependence of the widths that is usually assumed to be proportional to @xmath6 for neutrons with orbital momentum @xmath7 .",
    "finally , the situation is not strictly one - channel , since , along with elastic neutron scattering , many gamma - channels are open as well .",
    "however , apart from structural effects , even in one - channel approximation , there exists a generic cause for the deviations from the ptd , since the applicability of the goe is anyway violated by the _ open _",
    "character of the system @xcite .",
    "the appropriate modification of the goe and ptd predictions , which should be applied before making specific conclusions , is our goal below .",
    "the resonances are not the eigenstates of a hermitian hamiltonian , they are poles of the scattering matrix in the complex plane .",
    "their _ complex energies _ @xmath8 can be rigorously described as eigenvalues of the _ effective non - hermitian hamiltonian _ @xcite .",
    "as shown long ago , even for a single open channel , the statistical properties of the complex energies can not be described by the goe .",
    "the new dynamics is related to the interaction of intrinsic states through continuum . in the limit of strong coupling",
    "this leads to the overlapping resonances , ericson fluctuations of cross sections , and sharp redistribution of widths similar to the phenomenon of _ super - radiance _ , see the review @xcite and references therein .",
    "the control parameter of such restructuring is the ratio    lll [ 1 ] =    of typical widths , @xmath0 , to the mean spacing between the resonances , @xmath1 . in the region of low - energy neutron resonances",
    ", @xmath9 is still small but in order to correctly separate the general statistical effects from peculiar properties of individual nuclei we need to have at our disposal a generic width distribution that differs from the ptd as a function of the degree of openness .",
    "the goal of the paper is to provide a practical tool that would allow one to compare an experimental output for an unstable quantum system with predictions of random matrix theory .",
    "we propose a new distribution function that is based , similar to the goe , on the chaotic character of time - reversal invariant internal dynamics and corresponding decay amplitudes , but properly accounts for the continuum coupling through the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "the numerical simulations for this hamiltonian were described earlier @xcite but here we derive the analytical expression .",
    "we limit ourselves here by the situation typical for nuclear applications , namely @xmath10 .",
    "the super - radiant regime , @xmath11 , can be of special interest , including such systems as microwave cavities , and in the considered framework the formal symmetry exists , @xmath12 . at a large number of resonances and fixed number of open channels , after the super - radiant transition the broad state becomes a part of the background while the remaining  trapped \" states return into the non - overlap regime .",
    "however , in heavy nuclei this transition hardly can be observed because earlier many new channels can be opened ; in the modification of the ptd we see only precursors of this transition .",
    "our arguments will follow two different routes which lead to the equivalent results .",
    "the final formula for the statistical width distribution can be presented as    lll [ 2 ] p()=c ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "here we consider @xmath13 intrinsic states coupled to a single decay channel , for example , @xmath14-wave elastic neutron scattering .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is a mean energy spacing between the resonances , @xmath9 is a new dimensionless combination , eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) , and @xmath15 is a normalization constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the total sum ( the trace of the imaginary part of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian that remains invariant in the transition to the biorthogonal set of its eigenfunctions ) of all @xmath17 widths ; it appears as a parameter that fixes the starting ensemble distribution , see eqs .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) .",
    "the possible values of widths are restricted from both sides , @xmath18 .",
    "the above mentioned symmetry @xmath12 is reflected in the symmetry @xmath19 of a factor in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) but , as was already stated , our region of interest is at @xmath20 .",
    "another parameter , @xmath21 , determines the standard deviation of variable @xmath22 evaluated consistently with the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) . in the practical region",
    "far away from the super - radiance we obtain    lll [ 3 ] p()=c ^2_1 ( ) ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "the ptd is recovered in the limiting case @xmath23 that corresponds to the approximation of an open quantum system by a closed one .",
    "the new element is the factor explicitly determined by the coupling strength @xmath9 . with growing continuum coupling the probability of larger widths increases .",
    "the distribution ( [ 2 ] ) for different ratios @xmath24 is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "the origin of the square root in the new factor is the linear energy level repulsion typical for the goe spectral statistics .",
    "indeed , in the complex plane , @xmath8 , the distance between two poles @xmath25 and @xmath26 is @xmath27 ; after integration over all variables of other states we obtain a characteristic square root in the level repulsion , see below eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and the discussion after eq . ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "in order to come to the result ( [ 2 ] ) , we start with the general description of complex energies @xmath8 in a system of @xmath17 unstable states satisfying the goe statistics inside the system and interacting with the single open channel through gaussian random amplitudes .",
    "the general reaction theory @xcite is constructed in terms of the elements of the scattering matrix in the space of open channels @xmath28 ,    lll [ 4 ] s^ba(e)=^ba - it^ba(e ) .    within the formalism of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xmath29 ,",
    "the @xmath30-matrix is defined as    lll [ 5 ] t^ba(e)=_m , n=1^na_m^b_mna_n^a    in terms of the amplitudes @xmath31 connecting an internal basis state @xmath32 with an open channel @xmath33 . here",
    "we neglect the potential part of scattering that is not related to the internal dynamics of the compound nucleus . the anti - hermitian part of the effective hamiltonian is exactly represented by the sum over @xmath34 open channels ,    lll [ 6 ] w_mn=_a=1^ka_m^aa_n^a ,    where the amplitudes can be considered real in the case of time - reversal invariance .",
    "it is important that the factorized structure of the effective hamiltonian guarantees the unitarity of the scattering matrix .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath35 are uncorrelated gaussian quantities with zero mean and variance defined as @xmath36 . the trace of the anti - hermitian part of the effective hamiltonian , @xmath37 , i.e. the total sum of all @xmath17 widths used in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , is a quantity invariant under orthogonal transformation of the intrinsic basis .",
    "the detailed discussion of the whole approach , numerous applications and relevant references can be found in the recent review article @xcite .    the simplest version of the @xmath38-matrix description uses instead of the amplitude @xmath39 its approximate form , where the denominator contains poles on the real energy axis corresponding to the eigenvalues of the hermitian part @xmath40 of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "then the continuum coupling occurs only at the entrance and exit points of the process while the influence of this coupling on the intrinsic dynamics of the compound nucleus is neglected ( in general , @xmath40 should also be renormalized by the off - shell contributions from the presence of the decay channels ) .",
    "contrary to that , the full amplitude @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) , accounts for this coupling during the entire process including the virtual excursions to the continuum and back from intrinsic states .",
    "the poles are the eigenvalues of the full effective hamiltonian in the lower half of the complex energy plane .",
    "the experimental treatment corresponds to this full picture . according to the original paper @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath38-matrix code sammy @xcite had been used in the experimental analysis where the relevant expression is given in the form    lll [ 7 ] r_cc=__jj ,    and the treatment included a careful segregation of @xmath14- and @xmath41-resonances , @xmath42 for an even target nucleus . in the notations of @xcite @xmath43 represents a particular resonance , @xmath44 is the energy of the resonance . here",
    "we can identify the intermediate states @xmath43 and their complex energies @xmath45 with the eigenstates and complex eigenvalues of @xmath46 , while the numerator includes the amplitudes transformed to this new basis ( under time - reversal invariance the scattering matrix is symmetric ) . in terms of the reduced width @xmath47 and the penetration factor @xmath48",
    ", the partial width is @xmath49 . assuming a single channel and universal energy dependence of penetration factors , the statistics of the total widths is the same as that of @xmath50 .",
    "for a single - channel case , the _ joint distribution _",
    "@xmath51 of all complex energy poles has been rigorously derived in @xcite under assumptions of the goe intrinsic dynamics in the closed system and gaussian distributed random decay amplitudes .",

    "the structure of this result guarantees that all widths @xmath0 are positive .",
    "the difficulty with the distribution of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) is that it is _ not an analytic function _ of complex energies .",
    "our first step is to specify a single @xmath17-th pole @xmath58 and , using the fact that the distribution ensures @xmath59 , return to the absolute values of the amplitudes , @xmath60 for other roots . in this form",

    "we are working in the central region of the spectrum where the level density is approximately constant and the energy spectrum is close to equidistant ( the maximum of the level spacing distribution is always at @xmath72 although the distribution in an open system changes at small spacings , @xmath73 , as we will comment later ) . with @xmath74 , we are able to perform an exact calculation of the product :    lll [ 12 ] c_n _ n=_n ( _ n=1^n)^1/2_n= _ n ( ) ^1/2 ,    where we have used the famous _ euler formula _ ,    lll [ 13 ] = _",

    "we use the eigenbasis of the imaginary part @xmath75 of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian . due to the factorized nature of @xmath75 dictated by unitarity @xcite , the number of its non - zero eigenvalues is equal to the number of open channels . in our case",

    "an important intermediate step is the evaluation of the infinite product of the lorentzian peaks that can be simplified as    lll [ 20 ] ( _ n=1^n-1)^-1/2= ( _ n=1^n-1)^-1/2=()^+1/2 .    in a similar way one can analyze the resonance spacing distribution @xmath83 along the real energy axis ; spacings @xmath84 are measured in units of their mean value @xmath1 . as predicted in @xcite and observed numerically in @xcite , the short - range repulsion disappears and the wigner surmise with the standard linear preexponential factor @xmath14",

    "at spacing @xmath85 , the probability behaves as @xmath86 with the quadratic dependence on @xmath14 that , similar to the gue , mimics the violation of time - reversal invariance due to the open decay channel .",
    "the absence of short - range repulsion , @xmath87 ( the interaction through continuum , opposite to a normal hermitian perturbation , repells widths and attracts real energies @xcite ) , reflects the energy uncertainty of unstable states .",
    "we demonstrated that two complementary approaches which reflect different physical aspects of the situation lead essentially to the equivalent ( after identification of corresponding parameters ) results which we prefer to write in the form ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we expect that for other canonical ensembles the width distribution far from the super - radiance can be expressed by a similar formula with the function @xmath88 , where the standard index of ensemble is @xmath89 for the goe , @xmath90 for the gue , and @xmath91 for the gaussian symplectic ensemble . in the same way we expect the square root in eq .",
    "( [ 21 ] ) to be substituted by the same power @xmath92 .",
    "the doorway approach naturally indicates the limits of the variable , @xmath93 .",
    "it has also an advantage of the possibility to generalize the answer taking into account explicitly the _ rigidity _ of the internal energy spectrum with fluctuations of level spacings around their mean value @xmath1 [ in our approximation , only this average value enters eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) ] .",
    "another direction of generalization includes the possible influence of a single - particle resonance depending on a position of its centroid with respect to the considered interval of the resonance spectrum . in particular , that centroid may be located under threshold of our decay channel . in this case",
    "even the standard energy dependence of the widths can change as was mentioned long ago @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the doorway state may or may not coincide with such a resonance so that the effective hamiltonian ( [ 15 ] ) may contain two special states coupled with the  chaotic \" background , one by intrinsic interactions and another one through the continuum .",
    "the goal of this section is to estimate in the same spirit the influence of @xmath94-channels on the resonance width distribution .",
    "only a single open elastic neutron channel was taken into account in the analysis of data @xcite .",
    "the presence of even weak additional open channels changes the unitarity conditions",
    ". examples of mutual influence of neutron and gamma channels are well known in the literature from long ago , see for example @xcite .",
    "generalizing the doorway description we allow now each intrinsic state to decay by gamma - emission which is always possible independently of the position of the neutron threshold . in the simplest approximation ,",

    ".    the resonance width distribution for an open quantum system with @xmath94-channels included is given by    lll [ 26 ] p(,)=_-^+ ( -g(,e , ) ) _ n=1^ndh_n .",
    "estimating the gamma - widths by their average value , @xmath94 , and acting in the same manner as in the case of a single open channel we come to the final expression for the resonance width distribution ,    lll [ 27 ] p(,)=c ( ) ^1/2 ,    that is shifted by @xmath97 compared to the previous result . the mentioned earlier symmetry between the ends of the distribution , @xmath98 and @xmath99 ,",
    "would be substituted here by @xmath100 .",
    "thus , the effective influence of @xmath94-channels on the resonance width distribution is reduced here to a shift of the whole distribution by a mean radiation width @xmath94 as seen in fig .",

    ", the treatment of the data has to be modified making in a sense an inverse shift .",
    "of course , a more precise consideration should use a statistical distribution of the gamma widths .",
    "in this article we propose a new resonance width distribution for an open quantum system based on chaotic intrinsic dynamics and coupling of states with the same quantum numbers to the common decay channel .",
    "two approximate methods lead to an equivalent analytical expression for the width distribution that does not belong to the class of chi - square distributions with the only parameter @xmath2 traditionally used in the analysis of data . in the limit of vanishing openness and return to a closed system we recover the standard ptd .",
    "the new result depends on the ratio ( [ 1 ] ) of the width to the mean level spacing , @xmath102 , that regulates the strength of the continuum coupling .",
    "the deviations from the ptd grow with @xmath9 up to the critical strength @xmath103 , when the broad  super - radiant \" state becomes essentially the part of the background , while the remaining  trapped \" states return to the weak coupling regime .",
    "this physics was repeatedly discussed previously , especially in relation to quantum signal transmission through mesoscopic devices @xcite , but it is outside of our interest here .    in the practical region of low - energy neutron resonances ,",
    "the effects predicted here are relatively small .",
    "although at small @xmath9 the derived neutron width distribution supports an experimental trend , the final judgment can be made only after the presence of gamma - channels was accounted for .",
    "we have to attract the attention of experimentalists to the fact that the data should be analyzed with the aid of the distribution that does not belong to the routinely used chi - square class ; gamma channels should be included into consideration .",
    "we can also mention that the result agrees with numerical simulations @xcite for the full many - resonance distribution function ( [ 8 ] ) . using the suggested distribution as a new reference point",
    ", one can ascribe the remaining deviations to the specific features of individual systems ( level densities , single - particle structure in a given energy region , shape transformations , energy dependence of the widths etc . ) .",
    "unfortunately , we still do not have experimental tests for the full distribution ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "although in nuclear physics it is hard to make such a detailed analysis for higher energies and greater degree of resonance overlap , the systems with tunable chaos , such as microwave cavities , acoustic blocks , or even elastomechanical devices @xcite , seem to provide appropriate tools for such studies .",
