    "experimentally , the membrane tubulation and curvature - sensing by various types of bar superfamily proteins have been observed  @xcite .    objects with rotational symmetry , such as spherical colloids or conical integral proteins inserted perpendicularly to the membrane , generate an isotropic membrane curvature .",
    "conversely , bar domains which are banana - shaped generate an anisotropic curvature  @xcite ( amphipathic @xmath0-helices can also yield an anisotropic curvature  @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical models have shown that membrane inclusions , such as adsorbed or embedded proteins , or colloids , undergo long - range interactions that are mediated by the curvature elasticity of the membrane  @xcite .",

    "the mixture of inclusions with isotropic and anisotropic curvatures was shown to produce the self - assembly of a neckless of anisotropic inclusions around a domain consisting of a lattice of isotropic inclusions , mimicking the assembly of dynamin proteins around a scaffolded bud  @xcite .",

    "in the present study , we investigate the membrane - mediated interactions between two types of protein rods with opposite spontaneous curvatures , theoretically and numerically .",

    "our results show that rods of same curvature self - assemble into long straight structures that attract rods of opposite curvature on their sides .",

    "let @xmath5 be the vector going from the center of rod  1 to the center of rod  2 , and @xmath6 .",
    "we assume that the rods impose curvatures @xmath7 and @xmath8 along the directions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , at angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 with respect @xmath5 and @xmath13 , respectively ( fig .",

    "accordingly , in the following we neglect the contributions proportional to @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the curvature - mediated interaction energy between two rods in the absence of membrane tension , @xmath19 , is thus obtained as @xmath20 .",

    "graphs of this interaction are represented in fig .",

    "( [ eq : hint ] ) gives @xmath27 which is independent of the orientation of the other rod .",
    "in contrast , when the axes of both rods are perpendicular to the separation vector , i.e. , @xmath28 , @xmath29 has the opposite sign and an amplitude three times larger : @xmath30    hence , when two rods are identical , i.e. , @xmath31 , they have a strong attractive interaction at @xmath28 , while they have a weak repulsive interaction at @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "obviously , when they are perpendicular to their separation vector they will attract up to contact since they match exactly and produce less deformation when they superimpose .",
    "when two rods have curvatures of opposite sign , i.e. , @xmath32 , the interactions are opposite . for @xmath25 or @xmath26 ,",
    "the rods have a weak attractive interaction .",
    "rods of opposite curvatures in a tip - to - tip configuration produce no large - scale curvature deformation when they get close , therefore they will attract up to contact",
    ". this will likely be true also for rods not exactly opposite in curvature .",
    "thus , for neighboring rods at equilibrium , we expect identical rods to align preferentially side - to - side and rods of opposite curvature to align tip - to - tip .",
    "the derivation of the interaction in the presence of membrane tension , @xmath33 , is described in appendix  [ sec : apthe ] , sec .",
    "[ tensioncase ] . for the same reasons as previously",
    ", we retain in the interaction only the terms proportional to @xmath34 . in the regime of strong tensions ,",
    "i.e. , for @xmath35 , fig .",
    "[ fig : th - id]a , b , and c , show that the interaction @xmath36 displays several similitudes and differences with the tensionless case :    1 .   at short distances",
    "the attractive / repulsive behavior is the same as in the tensionless case .",
    "hence , identical rods will bind side - to - side and rods of opposite curvature tip - to - tip , as previously .",
    "2 .   the range of the interaction is shorter in the presence of tension : the black curves decay more rapidly that the gray ones .",
    "the interaction in the tip - to - tip configuration is not monotonic in the strong tension case ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : th - id]b , black lines ) .",
    "since identical rods attract strongly and align side - to - side , while opposite rods align preferentially tip - to - tip , we expect the following scenario .",
    "identical rods should aggregate into straight rod assemblies , and parallel rod assemblies should either repel one another , if they are made of rods of same curvature , or attract one another side - to - side if they are made with rods of opposite curvatures .",
    "alternate and periodic stripe structures are therefore expected to develop .",
    "we detail in appendix  [ sec : apthe2 ] the calculation of the interaction @xmath46 between two coarse - grained parallel rod assemblies of length @xmath47 that are separated by a center - to - center distance @xmath23 .",
    "the result is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the contribution coming from the extremities of the rods , which is subdominant and which we do not evaluate .",
    "this interaction confirms that parallel rod assemblies of like curvatures repel while rod assemblies of opposite curvatures attract .",
    "the first term , proportional to the length of the rods , vanishes in the absence of tension , i.e. , for @xmath4 .",
    "this can easily be understood as flat membrane patches can fit in between the rod assemblies at no cost in the absence of tension .",
    "however , some interaction will originate from the extremities of the rod assemblies ( @xmath49 ) , similar to that of isolated rods .",
    "in the presence of tension , the energy per unit length will dominate and produce the attraction of rod assemblies of opposite curvature .",
    "we see then two properties : ( 1 ) the interaction is short - ranged , decaying over @xmath37 , ( 2 ) the larger the tension the stronger the interaction .",

    "these shape changes can be characterized by the radius of gyration @xmath163 and the shape parameter , asphericity @xmath164 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_ves]e and f ) .",
    "the asphericity is the degree of deviation from a spherical shape and is expressed as  @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the eigenvalues of the gyration tensor of the vesicle : @xmath168 , where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are the coordinates of the center of mass . for a perfect sphere , @xmath171 , for a thin rod @xmath172 , and for a thin disk , @xmath173 .",
    "starting from a disk - shaped vesicle ( labeled ` up ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_ves]e and f ) , the vesicles have more spherical and less compact shapes than invaginated vesicles so that they take larger @xmath163 and smaller @xmath164 .",
    "thus , the vesicle shapes can be chosen from many metastable conformations by using the hysteresis of @xmath118 variations .",
    "our simulations demonstrate a control method of the vesicle shapes by using hysteresis .",
    "we have studied the assembly structures of binary banana - shaped protein rods .",
    "compared to the situation where only one type of rod is present , the coexistence of two types of rods , with opposite curvatures , induces a greater variety of membrane shapes . here",
    ", using meshless membrane simulations , we demonstrated straight bumps and stripe structures in flat membranes , and buckled rims and ellipsoidal invaginations in vesicles .",
    "more complicated shapes such as vesicles with periodic bumps , like cartridge pleats , can be formed for larger vesicles .",
    "these structure formations can be examined in experiments with two types of bar proteins absorbed on the same side of the membrane or with a single type of protein absorbed on both side of the membrane .",
    "the periodic length of the stripe structure is the sum of the longitudinal lengths of two bar domains ( @xmath174 to @xmath125 nm ) .",
    "it should therefore be observable by electron microscopy .    for rods of like curvatures",
    ", our theory predicts a side - to - side attractive interaction and a tip - to - tip repulsion . for rods having curvatures of opposite sign",
    "our theory predicts the reverse , i.e. , a tip - to - tip attraction and a side - to - side repulsion .",
    "our coarse - grained simulations revealed that identical rods assemble in the side - to - side configuration and thus build straight rod assemblies ; these assemblies attract the rods with opposite curvatures in the tip - to - tip configuration thereby inducing a side - to - side alignment of the formed assemblies .",
    "the formation of those alternate assemblies , or stripe structures , therefore agrees well with our theoretical predictions .    with increasing membrane tension",
    ", we theoretically found that the attractive interaction between opposite rods in the tip - to - tip configuration ( which corresponds to the orientations involved in the stripe structures ) is increased at short distances and decreased at large distances ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : th - id]b ) .",
    "likewise , our larger - scale analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec : tbars ] predicts a short - range attraction between opposite straight rod assemblies that increases with membrane tension .",
    "these theoretical results explain well the observed increased stability of the stripe structures when the tension is increased and the shorter length of the rod assemblies in the thermalized system .",
    "these theoretical predictions are supported by our simulation results although the theory considers rigid rods with a fixed shape while the rods in the simulation are flexible .",
    "the real proteins are not completely rigid but their stiffness is not measured . the rods flexibility can be considered to result in an effectively smaller rod curvature , not altering the sign of the interactions in the present assemblies .",
    "the protein stiffness , together with the finite size of the rod inclusions , should however be taken into account for quantitative predictions of the assembly conditions .",
    "the effects of the casimir force , induced by the fluctuations of the membrane , remains to be investigated further .",
    "it was ignored in the present work since it is normally sub - dominant for small inclusions imposing large membrane deformations .",
    "this casimir force is known however to induce an effective attraction between long straight rods  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated straight rods in our simulations , and found that the latter have too weak casimir interactions to induce rod clusters for the present length ( @xmath70 ) . however , twice longer rods ( @xmath175 ) can form clusters . thus",
    ", the assembly of longer rods can be induced by both casimir and rod - curvature forces .    in living cells ,",
    "many types of bar superfamily proteins cooperate to regulate membrane shapes . here , we have studied only the mixture of two types of proteins .",
