    "cellular systems are evolving into heterogeneous networks consisting of distributed base stations ( bss ) covering overlapping areas of different sizes , and thus the problems of interference management and cell association are becoming complicated and challenging @xcite .",
    "one of the most promising solutions to these problems is given by so called _ cloud radio access networks _",
    ", in which the encoding / decoding functionalities of the bss are migrated to a central unit .",
    "this is done by operating the bss as `` soft '' relays that interface with the central unit via backhaul links used to carry only baseband signals ( and not `` hard '' data information ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "cloud radio access networks are expected not only to effectively handle the inter - cell interference but also to lower system cost related to the deployment and management of the bss .",
    "however , one of the main impairments to the implementation of cloud radio access networks is given by the capacity limitations of the digital backhaul links connecting the bss and the central unit .",
    "these limitations are especially pronounced for pico / femto - bss , whose connectivity is often afforded by last - mile cables @xcite@xcite , and for bss using wireless backhaul links @xcite .    in the _ uplink _ of cloud radio access networks , each bs compresses its received signal to the central unit via its finite - capacity backhaul link .",
    "the central unit then performs joint decoding of all the mobile stations ( mss ) based on all received compressed signals .",
    "recent theoretical results have shown that _ distributed compression _",
    "schemes @xcite can provide significant advantages over the conventional approach based on independent compression at the bss .",
    "this is because the signals received by different bss are statistically correlated @xcite-@xcite , and hence distributed source coding enables the quality of the compressed signal received from one bs to be improved by leveraging the signals received from the other bss as side information .",
    "note that the correlation among the signals received by the bss is particularly pronounced for systems with many small cells concentrated in given areas .",
    "while current implementations @xcite@xcite employ conventional independent compression across the bss , the advantages of distributed source coding were first demonstrated in @xcite , and then studied in more general settings in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "related works based on the idea of computing a function of the transmitted codewords at the bss , also known as compute - and - forward , can be found in @xcite@xcite .    in the _ downlink _ of cloud radio access networks ,",
    "the central encoder performs joint encoding of the messages intended for the mss .",
    "then , it independently compresses the produced baseband signals to be transmitted by each bs .",
    "these baseband signals are delivered via the backhaul links to the corresponding bss , which simply upconvert and transmit them through their antennas .",
    "this system was studied in @xcite@xcite . in particular , in @xcite ,",
    "the central encoder performs dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite of all mss signals before compression .",
    "a similar approach was studied in @xcite by accounting for the effect of imperfect channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "reference @xcite instead proposes strategies based on compute - and - forward , showing advantages in the low - backhaul capacity regime and high sensitivity of the performance to the channel parameters . for a review of more conventional strategies in which the backhaul links are used to convey message information , rather than the compressed baseband signals ,",
    "we refer to @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this work , we propose a novel approach for the compression on the backhaul links of cloud radio access networks in the downlink that can be seen as the counterpart of the distributed source coding strategy studied in @xcite-@xcite for the uplink .",
    "moreover , we propose the joint design of precoding and compression .",
    "a key idea is that of allowing the quantization noise signals corresponding to different bss to be correlated with each other . the motivation behind this choice is the fact that a proper design of the correlation of the quantization noises across the bss can be beneficial in limiting the effect of the resulting quantization noise seen at the mss .",
    "in order to create such correlation , we propose to jointly compress the baseband signals to be delivered over the backhaul links using so called _ multivariate compression _",
    "* ch . 9 ) .",
    "we also show that , in practice , multivariate compression can be implemented without resorting to joint compression across all bss , but using instead a successive compression strategy based on a sequence of minimum mean squared error ( mmse ) estimation and per - bs compression steps .    after reviewing some preliminaries on multivariate compression in sec .",

    "<S> this work studies the joint design of precoding and backhaul compression strategies for the downlink of cloud radio access networks . in these systems </S>",
    "<S> , a central encoder is connected to multiple multi - antenna base stations ( bss ) via finite - capacity backhaul links . at the central encoder , </S>",
    "<S> precoding is followed by compression in order to produce the rate - limited bit streams delivered to each bs over the corresponding backhaul link . in current state - of - the - art approaches , </S>",
    "<S> the signals intended for different bss are compressed independently . in contrast </S>",
    "<S> , this work proposes to leverage joint compression , also referred to as multivariate compression , of the signals of different bss in order to better control the effect of the additive quantization noises at the mobile stations ( mss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of maximizing the weighted sum - rate with respect to both the precoding matrix and the joint correlation matrix of the quantization noises is formulated subject to power and backhaul capacity constraints . </S>",
    "<S> an iterative algorithm is proposed that achieves a stationary point of the problem . moreover , in order to enable the practical implementation of multivariate compression across bss , a novel architecture is proposed based on successive steps of minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) estimation and per - bs compression . </S>",
    "<S> robust design with respect to imperfect channel state information is also discussed . from numerical results , it is confirmed that the proposed joint precoding and compression strategy outperforms conventional approaches based on the separate design of precoding and compression or independent compression across the bss .    </S>",
