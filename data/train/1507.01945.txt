    "the fact that we are tracing circumgalactic gas via  ii  and  ii  absorption lines indicates that this gas must have been enriched by previous generations of supernovae ( i.e. , it is not pristine , metal - free gas ) .",

    "such a model would not be able to explain the large specific angular momentum we observe at @xmath9  kpc .",
    "in other words , the rotational velocity of supernova - heated gas originating from @xmath187  kpc would decrease by a factor of six as it traveled radially outwards ( e.g. , decreasing from @xmath188  km  s@xmath3  at @xmath189  kpc to @xmath190  km  s@xmath3  at @xmath132  kpc ) .",

    "<S> the strongest absorber ( @xmath5   ) has an estimated column density ( @xmath6  @xmath7 ) and line - of - sight velocity dispersion ( @xmath8  km  s@xmath3 ) that are consistent with the observed properties of extended  i  disks in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the rotation curve also suggests that this @xmath9  kpc gaseous disk is warped with respect to the stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we detect two weak  ii  absorbers in the halo with small velocity dispersions ( @xmath10  km  s@xmath3 ) . while the exact geometry is unclear , one component is consistent with an extraplanar gas cloud near the disk - halo interface that is co - rotating with the disk , and the other is consistent with a tidal feature similar to the magellanic stream . </S>",
    "<S> we can place lower limits on the cloud sizes ( @xmath11  kpc ) for these absorbers given the extended nature of the background source . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of these results for models of the geometry and kinematics of gas in the circumgalactic medium . </S>"
