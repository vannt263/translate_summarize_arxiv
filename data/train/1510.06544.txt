    "modelling the chemical evolution of the gas during the process of star formation on various scales is a numerically and theoretically challenging task . on the one hand , it requires to solve a large set of reaction equations with sufficient accuracy , which is computationally extremely demanding . on the other hand in depth knowledge about the necessary reactions and their corresponding rates",
    "is required , which involves laboratory work and quantum mechanical calculations .",
    "nonetheless , the chemical state of the gas and the associated cooling and heating processes are required to properly model the thermodynamical evolution of the gas and to make accurate predictions via synthetic observations . in particular in the latter case it is common to use fixed conversion factors to e.g. obtain the number density of a particular molecular species from the gas density which , however , is a severe oversimplification and might not be accurate enough .",
    "several authors have incorporated reduced chemical networks in their 3d , magneto - hydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the newly designed chemistry package krome @xcite is a versatile package which allows the user to incorporate chemistry in mhd simulations in a very efficient manner and simultaneously guarantees the freedom to choose _ any _ desired network as well as its associated cooling and heating processes .",
    "it is therefore a good choice to model the complex chemical evolution of star forming regions .",
    "recently , the importance of filamentary structures in star forming clouds has been re - emphasized ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these filaments result from the interaction of gravity and turbulence and harbour pre- and protostellar cores ( for recent numerical works see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations of molecular line and dust emission provide a wealth of information about the properties of these filaments , like e.g. the thermodynamical state , the typical extension , and fragmentation of the filaments .",
    "numerical simulations , however , often lack the detailed description of the chemical state and can thus be compared only indirectly to the observations .",
    "this and the fact that filaments appear to be ubiquitous in the star formation process make them an optimal target to test the feasibility of using a detailed chemical network in fully self - consistent 3d - mhd simulations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : ic ] we briefly discuss the initial conditions , in section  [ sec : chem ] we describe the employed chemical network and heating and cooling processes . in section  [ sec : results ] we describe the time evolution of a fiducial run and study the impact of the radiation field on the chemical and thermal evolution of the filaments . in section  [ sec : dis ]",
    "we compare with observations and give details about the computational cost before we summarize our results .",
    "the simulations presented here use the same initial conditions and numerical methods  except the chemistry and cooling / heating processes  as those presented in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly summarize the main points .",
    "the simulations are performed with the astrophysical code flash 4.2.2 @xcite .",
    "we solve the equations of ideal mhd using a maximum resolution of 40.3 au .",
    "the poisson equation for gravity is solved using a multipole method based on a barnes - hut tree @xcite .",
    "the simulated filaments have an initial width of about 0.1 pc following a plummer - like density profile along the radial direction .",
    "the filaments have a length of 1.6 pc and a mass per unit length of 75 m@xmath2/pc .",
    "this corresponds to about three times the critical mass per unit length @xcite of @xmath3 which is why the filaments are unstable against collapse along the radial direction and subject to subsequent fragmentation .",
    "the initial central density of the filaments is @xmath4 g @xmath5 .",
    "recent observations have shown that filaments have magnetic fields which can be directed either along or perpendicular to the filament ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is why we test both magnetic field orientations .",
    "we take the initial magnetic field strength in the centre of the filament to be 40 @xmath6 g , in agreement with recent observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the field is uniform in strength for the perpendicular case and declines outwards in the parallel case proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we superimpose a transonic turbulent velocity field ( for more details see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the strength of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) and the cosmic ray ionisation rate ( crir ) influence the reaction rates as well as the heating of dust , which is taken into account by the chemistry package ( see online material ) .",
    "since , however , the strength of the isrf and the crir can vary locally in our galaxy , we perform simulations with different values . in our fiducial run",
    "we apply a crir of @xmath8 s@xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and an isrf corresponding to 1.7 times the habing flux ( g@xmath10 = 1.7 , * ? ? ?",
    "since for the crir also significantly higher values are found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we perform a second pair ( perpendicular and parallel magnetic fields ) of simulations with a crir of @xmath11 s@xmath9 and g@xmath10 = 1.7 . in the third set of simulations we additionally increase the isrf by a factor of 5 , i.e. g@xmath10 = 8.5 . hence , in total we have a set of six simulations with different ( initial ) conditions .",
    "in order to model the chemical evolution of the gas , we use the krome package @xcite , which in principle allows to model any desired chemical network .",
    "the network used contains 37 species and 287 reactions including different forms of hydrogen and carbon bearing species like h@xmath1 , h , h@xmath0 , c@xmath1 , c , and co but also more complex species like e.g. hco@xmath1 , h@xmath0o , or the cosmic ray tracer h@xmath12 .",
    "in particular , the network allows for a very detailed description of the formation of co and h@xmath0 ( also including the formation of h@xmath0 on dust ) .",
    "we assume that all elements heavier than he are depleted with respect to their cosmic abundances using values given by @xcite typical for dense molecular gas .",
    "initially all elements are in their atomic form .",
    "more details about the used species , reactions , and initial abundances are provided in the online material .",
    "in addition , we benchmark our implementation ( network and radiative transfer ) against the kosma-@xmath13 pdr code for two tests presented in @xcite and find very good agreement .    the strength of the isrf and the crir are needed to model the chemical evolution as well as the heating and cooling processes properly .",
    "in particular , the isrf experiences an attenuation when travelling through the gas .",
    "we calculate the attenuation in the flash code with the treecol algorithm @xcite . for each cell in the computational domain we compute the total ( h + h@xmath0 ) , h@xmath0 , and the co column densities in 48 directions .",
    "we take the geometrical average and obtain the mean column densities , n@xmath14 , n@xmath15 , and n@xmath16 , as well as the visual extinction , @xmath17 , and the self - shielding factors for h@xmath0 and co photodissociation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 in @xcite for a more detailed technical description ) .",
    "the attenuation of the isrf also affects the photoelectric ( pe ) heating due to dust particles , which is taken into account by scaling the strength of the isrf with g@xmath10 @xmath18 exp(-2.5 @xmath17 ) .",
    "the cooling rate due to line emission of co is provided by k. omukai in tabulated form based on the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the actual rate in each cell depends on n@xmath16 and the local gas density and gas temperature , @xmath19 .",
    "we also use these tabulated rates to calculate the cooling due to @xmath20co and c@xmath21o by downscaling n@xmath16 and the according cooling rates by 69 and 557 , respectively @xcite .    finally , for calculating the dust temperature , @xmath22 , we take into account the transfer of energy from gas to grains via collisions , which also affects @xmath19 itself , heating of the grains due to the isrf , and cooling of dust grains via black - body radiation . in each timestep",
    ", we calculate the equilibrium dust temperature for all three processes after the chemistry update is done .",
    "we emphasize that a more detailed description of all cooling and heating processes used and their coupling to the isrf and the crir is provided in the online material .",
    "before we start the different simulations , we evolve the chemistry in each cell for 500 kyr , during which the hydrodynamical evolution is _ turned off _ ,",
    "i.e. only @xmath19 , @xmath22 , and the chemical composition are updated . since at densities of about 10@xmath23 @xmath5",
    "the typical timescale for h@xmath0 formation on dust grains is of the order of 100 kyr , 500 kyr are sufficient to reach a rough chemical equilibrium .",
    "after this initial relaxation phase , each simulation is followed for .    in the following ,",
    "we present the time evolution of the run with a parallel magnetic field , g@xmath10 = 1.7 , and a crir of 1.3 @xmath18 10@xmath24 s@xmath9 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : species ] we plot the spatial distribution of h , h@xmath0 , c , and co at the end of the simulation , which reveals some differences in the radial distribution . whereas h@xmath0 and co are concentrated towards the centre of the filament ,",
    "h and c are more extended .",
    "moreover , there is a clear impact of the initial turbulence field on the distribution of the chemical species , causing strong local variations .    , c , and co at the end of the simulation with a parallel magnetic field , g@xmath10 = 1.7 , and a crir of 1.3 @xmath18 10@xmath24 s@xmath9 along a slice through the centre of the filament .",
    "]    the radial density profiles of h@xmath0 , h , h@xmath1 , co , c , and c@xmath1 at 4 different times are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : time ] . in order to smooth out local fluctuations ,",
    "we have averaged the densities along the major axis of the filament .    , h , h@xmath1 ( top row ) , and co , c , and c@xmath1 ( bottom row ) at after the start of the same simulation as in fig .",
    "[ fig : species ] .",
    "note that at t = 0 , the chemical distribution corresponds to that after an initial relaxation phase of 500 kyr . in order to use the same @xmath25-axis , @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are scaled up by a factor of 10@xmath28 and 10@xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the black line in the upper left panel shows the total hydrogen density divided by two . ]",
    "the constant increase of the central number densities of h@xmath0 and co over time is caused by the contraction of the filament along the radial direction .",
    "on the other hand , the abundance of h , h@xmath1 , c , and c@xmath1 remain almost constant over time as they recombine when the filament becomes denser . in the upper left panel",
    "we also show the number density of all h atoms ( divided by two in order to be comparable to @xmath30 ) , which represents the shape of the mass density profile . in the centre of the filament",
    "most of the hydrogen is bound in h@xmath0 , only outside @xmath31 0.1 pc , where the black and purple line start to differ , hydrogen mainly occurs in atomic form .",
    "hence , there is a gradual conversion of h to h@xmath0 towards the centre of the filament as well as of c@xmath1 over c to co , with @xmath32 exceeding @xmath33 at @xmath31 0.1 pc as well .",
    "this agrees with the picture obtained from fig .",
    "[ fig : species ] that h and c envelop h@xmath0 and co and is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of pdrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that a similar result was also found by @xcite .",
    "next , we study the influence of the isrf and crir on the properties of the filaments . in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] we plot the radial dependence of h@xmath0 , h , and h@xmath1 ( top row ) , as well as of co , c , and c@xmath1 ( middle row ) and of @xmath19 and @xmath22 , ( bottom row ) at the end of each of the six simulations . on the left",
    "we show the runs with a perpendicular magnetic field , on the right runs with a parallel magnetic field . as already seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : time ] , we find a gradual conversion of h to h@xmath0 , and c@xmath1 over c to co towards centre of the filaments for all runs .        increasing the crir results in a somewhat higher ionisation reflected by the abundances of h@xmath1 and c@xmath1 .",
    "moreover , at high densities @xmath34 is around a few times 1 @xmath5 with somewhat higher values for higher crir and thus in good agreement with theoretical predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "also @xmath19 shows a slight increase with increasing crir , which is due to the larger amount of energy released by various dissociation reactions caused by cosmic rays .",
    "increasing the strength of the isrf only marginally affects the chemical composition of the gas .",
    "however , @xmath19 and @xmath22 are increased by a few kelvin , which is most likely due to the increased pe heating .",
    "interestingly , we find that for all runs @xmath22 decreases towards the centre of the filaments . we attribute this to the progressive attenuation of the isrf  mainly responsible for dust heating  towards the centre of the filament ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the gas temperature , however , shows a significant increase between 0.01 pc and 0.1 pc . investigating the dynamics of the filaments , we find that this corresponds to an accretion shock where the infalling gas is decelerated .    as shown in @xcite the magnetic field",
    "has a strong impact on the dynamical evolution of the filament , which is partly also reflected in the chemical composition . in particular the two runs with g@xmath10 = 1.7 and a crir of 1.3 @xmath18 10@xmath24 s@xmath9 show a somewhat different chemical composition with respect to atomic hydrogen and carbon . a more significant difference can be seen in the gas temperature , which as mentioned before , is tightly linked to the infall velocities , which in turn depends on the configuration of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig .  [ fig : radial ] , @xmath22 decreases towards the centre of the filament in all runs , which was recently also found in observations @xcite . from the averaged quantities ( figs .",
    "[ fig : time ] and  [ fig : radial ] ) we can now obtain the polytropic index @xmath35 of the dust by assuming a polytropic relation @xmath36 .",
    "we note that we rather use a relation between the @xmath22 ( instead of @xmath19 ) and @xmath37 in order to be able to directly compare our results to herschel observations : by visual inspection of the @xmath22 vs. @xmath37 plots ( see online material ) , we find @xmath35 to be in a range from 0.9 to 0.95 , which is in good agreement with @xcite .",
    "we again emphasize that @xmath19 and @xmath22 are markedly different , which requires independent measurements for both quantities in observations .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the collisional coupling between gas and dust at @xmath38 @xmath5 is not yet strong enough to assure similar temperatures , although our results suggest that @xmath22 and @xmath19 approach each other towards the center of the filaments .    by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] it can also be seen that the ratio @xmath39 is not constant along the radial direction .",
    "there is a strong decline of @xmath40 with increasing radius of about 2 orders of magnitude , which is due to the fact that the formation of co happens at somewhat smaller radii ( i.e. higher gas column densities ) than that of h@xmath0 .",
    "this variation in @xmath40 most likely also affects the value of the x - factor , which is used to convert co luminosities into h@xmath0 column densities .",
    "our work therefore suggests that caution is recommended when using co line intensities to obtain total gas masses .",
    "furthermore , varying crir and isrf mainly affects @xmath40 at radii larger than 0.05 pc . in the centre of the filament ,",
    "however , @xmath40 is comparable for all our runs with a value around @xmath41 , and thus in good agreement with observations ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) despite our simplified depletion description .",
    "we note that the variation of @xmath40 over time is rather small , independent of the considered run .",
    "finally , we emphasise that also abundances of other species like h@xmath12 , h@xmath0o , oh , or ch included in the network seem to be in reasonable agreement with observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is a significant step forward compared to smaller chemical networks used in previous works ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we postpone a more in - depth discussion of these species to a subsequent paper .",
    "the simulations were carried out on computing nodes with 2 - 5 gb memory per cpu , which corresponds to state - of - the - art computing nodes at modern supercomputing facilities ( see acknowledgements for which facilities were used ) . in order to estimate",
    "the increase of computational power required , we compare our runs with an isothermal ( @xmath42 = 15 k ) simulation without a chemical network , which is also evolved for 300 kyr . the slightly different thermodynamical evolution of the filaments in runs with and without the network results in slightly different timesteps as well as different numbers of cells in the simulation domain , which can not be avoided .",
    "however , these differences affect the cost estimates only marginally .",
    "overall , we find that the inclusion of the network ( including heating and cooling processes ) increases the computation costs per timestep by roughly a factor of 7 . however , tabulating the reaction rate coefficients , which avoids the repeated evaluation of the exponential function , reduces the cost increase to about a factor of 5 .",
    "altogether we argue that  considering the ever increasing computing power , the higher accuracy as well as the significant gain of additional physical and chemical information ",
    "it seems feasible and necessary for the future to perform simulations with large chemical networks .",
    "we present first results of simulations of star forming filaments using one of the largest chemical network ever applied in 3d - mhd simulations . for this",
    "we combine the versatile chemistry package krome @xcite with the treecol algorithm @xcite , which allows us to self - consistently calculate the optical depth and shielding parameters in the simulation domain , which in turn is required to properly determine dissociation and photoionization reactions .",
    "the network contains 37 species and 28.pdf7 thoroughly selected reactions .",
    "we show that in terms of memory consumption such simulations are feasible on modern supercomputers . despite an increase of computation costs by a factor of @xmath31 5  7",
    ", we argue that the significant gain of physical and chemical information justifies the usage of large chemical networks in future simulations .    concerning the chemical composition as well as the thermodynamical behaviour of the simulated filaments , the results appear to be promising and in good agreement with observational results .",
    "in particular , we show that there is a gradual conversion of h to h@xmath0 as well as of c@xmath1 over c to co towards the centre of the filaments .",
    "moreover , we find that the dust temperature @xmath22 decreases towards the centre of the filament following a polytropic relation @xmath36 with @xmath43 in agreement with recent observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that the dust and gas temperature can be markedly different even at densities of @xmath38 @xmath5",
    ".    this work paves the way for many future applications : the detailed chemical modelling will allow us to produce synthetic observations of several molecular lines as well as of continuum emission .",
    "filament widths obtained from these synthetic observations allow us to study how well a projected ( 2d ) width matches the actual ( 3d ) width of the filament obtained directly from the simulation data .",
    "furthermore , the simulations can improve our understanding of the x - factor required for the mass determination of gaseous objects .",
    "moreover , the network will allow us to study in detail the evolution of other molecules like h@xmath0o or the cosmic ray tracer h@xmath12 , which , due to space limitations , we could not discuss here .",
    "we also note that we plan to include even more complex chemical networks .",
    "in particular , the inclusion of nitrogen , a constituent of a number of important observational tracers , is of large interest .",
    "finally , we plan to improve our treatment of co freeze - out in order to get a better handle on the x - factor .",
    "the authors like to thank the referee for the comments which helped to significantly improve the paper .",
    "furthermore , the authors thank t. grassi and s. bovino for the development of the krome chemistry package and the useful discussions , as well as s. glover for discussions on the implementation of a dust cooling routine .",
