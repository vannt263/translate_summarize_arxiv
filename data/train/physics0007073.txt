    "<S> instead of using a frequency dependent refractive index , we propose to use the extinction theorem to describe reflection and transmission of an ultrashort pulse passing through the boundary . when the duration of the pulse is comparable with the relaxation time , the results differ significantly from those given by the traditional method , especially if the carrier frequency is close to an absorbtion line . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the two approaches using the data of gaas in the infrared domain .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that the reflection and refraction of an electromagnetic wave on the boundary of a material system is a light scattering phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms in the medium are brought into oscillations by the incoming wave , and then secondary waves are generated by the induced atomic dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted wave is the result of superposition of the scattered wave and the external field , while the reflected wave is a result of backscattering . </S>",
    "<S> one side of the process , the solution of the quantum mechanical equations of motion of the perturbed atoms ( or the forced oscillations in the classical model ) is treated in most textbooks in order to calculate the frequency dependence of the polarizability and the dielectric constant . </S>",
    "<S> the other side of the problem , the actual scattering process is usually replaced by phenomenological boundary conditions  </S>",
    "<S> fresnel formulas  for the macroscopic fields . </S>",
    "<S> one then uses a frequency dependent index of refraction , and calculates the response for each spectral component .    instead of that traditional approach which neglects the transient regime of the forced oscillations , </S>",
    "<S> we use a procedure that exhibits the actual physical process . </S>",
    "<S> this is the method of integral equations , known also as the ewald - oseen extinction theorem in the stationary situation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are going to consider here the one - dimensional variant of this theory applied to ultrafast pulses .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that local field effects influence the coupled atom - field dynamics , therefore it can affect the reflection and transmission properties too . for weak fields </S>",
    "<S> this leads only to a constant shift @xcite of the resonance frequencies , therefore we shall treat the problem here without this correction .    </S>",
    "<S> the extinction theorem has been applied for the resonant nonlinear case in our works @xcite but with the slowly varying amplitude approximation ( svea ) in time . </S>",
    "<S> the first model calculation for a linear medium treating the full time development of a pulse without svea has been given by one of us @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the boundary value problem for the transmission of a light pulse through a plane - parallel resonant layer consisting of polarizable atoms . </S>",
    "<S> let the incoming field be a linearly polarized plane wave : @xmath0 we restrict ourselves here to the case of normal incidence . </S>",
    "<S> then the problem is one dimensional in space , thus the macroscopic field obeys the inhomogeneous wave equation : @xmath1 in the situation considered here , @xmath2 is different from zero in a slab placed between @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the solution of eq.([waveq ] ) has the form@xcite : @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the solution of the homogeneous equation corresponding to ( [ waveq ] ) , and it is identified with the incoming wave , while the second term is a scattered wave which is the superposition of outgoing elementary waves originating in different @xmath7 planes . given an incoming wave , the transmitted wave is determined by the whole solution ( [ inteq ] ) at @xmath8 , while the reflected wave is described only by the second , integral term at @xmath9 .    as we are considering the linear case , </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the polarization @xmath10 in the medium can be determined by a first order perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> supposing that at the beginning the system is in its ground state , the dipole moment density induced by the field is given by the following expression : @xmath11   \\label{pert}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the number density of the dipoles in the medium , @xmath13 is the transition dipole matrix element between the ground state and the @xmath14-th excited level , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the corresponding transition frequencies and decay constants , and @xmath17 is the field strength at the position @xmath18 of the atomic dipole . in the ordinary theory of dispersion the time dependence of the electric field </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath19 is taken to be @xmath20 , and after performing the integration in ( [ pert ] ) the terms containing @xmath21 are omitted , as they are rapidly decaying . in this way one obtains a frequency dependent susceptibility @xmath22 and refractive index @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> our main point is that if the duration of the whole pulse is shorter than the decay time of the terms which contain @xmath24 , this traditional approach fails , and all the terms following from ( [ pert ] ) should be kept .    in the case of an optically thin layer , </S>",
    "<S> the calculations can be simplified . </S>",
    "<S> then @xmath25 , the spatial variation of the polarization can be neglected , and instead of integrating in eq.([inteq ] ) we can use the mean value of the time derivative of the polarization . in this thin medium case one can derive a system of coupled differential equations for the polarization components , @xmath26@xmath27 for an arbitrary thick layer one has to solve the coupled integro - differential equations ( [ inteq ] ) and ( [ pert ] ) , with a numerical method . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed calculations , based on the theory given here and compared the results with those of the traditional method of fresnel formulas . </S>",
    "<S> for definitness we have used the data@xcite of gaas in the infrared domain . </S>",
    "<S> two resonant frequencies and the with constants @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , ( @xmath32 ) , and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> reproduced very well the measured@xcite stationary dispersion and absorbtion of the material in the range @xmath36 . for the sake of simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we have chosen the following form of the incoming pulse @xmath37 , @xmath38 . as we are considering the ultrafast regime we have chosen @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of this incoming pulse is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) below . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of eq.([diffegy ] ) corresponding to this incoming pulse and to the initial conditions @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 can be given for the thin layer by an exact but lengthy formula . far from resonance @xmath43 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath44 both methods predict the same results . on the other hand significant differences </S>",
    "<S> can be seen for pulses with @xmath45 , i.e. close to resonance , but still in the linear regime . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations were performed with @xmath46 , for layers of different thicknesses of the order of the central wavelength , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows the results obtained for an optically thin layer @xmath48 . in that case </S>",
    "<S> we have solved the system of equations ( [ diffegy ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ inteq ] ) and ( [ pert ] ) are shown in fig . 2 for a layer of thickness of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the continuous lines are the results obtained from the present transient extinction theory , while the dashed lines are the amplitudes obtained by using the frequency dependent index of refraction . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen , that some of the overall characteristics of the response obtained by the two different methods are similar . </S>",
    "<S> both treatments predict significant broadening of the reflected and transmitted pulses , since the decay time , @xmath50 is long compared with the duration of the excitation . in addition , till the end of the exciting pulse , @xmath51 , the reflected amplitudes are very similar except for a little phase shift . </S>",
    "<S> the transmitted pulse appears in both cases with the same expected delay that can be calculated as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the the group velocity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath54 in good agreement with the numerical result . </S>",
    "<S> we note , in addition , that both methods yielded precursors @xcite in the transmitted fields appearing at @xmath55 , not seen in the figures , because of their smallness .    in the case of the thin layer </S>",
    "<S> the forms of the fields are quite similar , see fig 1 . on the other hand significant differences </S>",
    "<S> are seen in the time dependences of the transmitted and reflected pulses calculated by the two different treatments in layers of thickness comparable with @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute these differences in the amplitudes , as well as in the phases to the approximative character of the time dependence of the polarization in the fourier method , i.e. to the omission of the transients at the beginning and at the end of the excitation . </S>",
    "<S> this part is non - negligible if the duration of the process is comparable with the relaxation time since it represents an important contribution to the elementary waves generated by the induced dipoles .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we find that for ultrafast pulses the properties of a dispersive medium must be calculated by taking care of the transient response of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done best by using a fully time dependent treatment as proposed in the present work .    </S>",
