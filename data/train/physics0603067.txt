    "we present a detailed description on how the eigenmodes of the em field within a 2d lamellar grating slice are obtained on the plane - wave basis , and how the transfer - matrix connecting fields at two sides of the grating slice is related to these eigenmodes .",

    "<S> epsf    starting from the pioneering papers of yablonovich @xcite and john @xcite in 1987 , the past decade has witnessed a great deal of interest in photonic crystals ( pcs ) , also named as photonic band gap ( pbg ) materials . </S>",
    "<S> these have dielectric constituents which are periodically arranged in space , either in one , two , or three dimensions , with important potential applications in the optical , microwave and infrared fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of their important properties is to mould and control the flow and distribution of the light at its most microscopic level . </S>",
    "<S> the synergetic interplay in these pcs between the microcavity resonances of composite particles and the bragg scattering resonances of the dielectric arrays lead to the formation of a pbg , i.e. , a range of frequencies for which no propagating electromagnetic ( em ) modes are allowed . due to the presence of the pbg in the dispersion relation of the em field , the photonic density of states in pcs is suppressed over a certain frequency window . </S>",
    "<S> these features open the possibility for many important technological applications including lossless pc waveguides , low - threshold pc lasers , and high - q pc nanocavities @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the early research efforts were concentrated on pbg materials consisting of positive and frequency - independent dielectrics . in the past few years , due to the new developments in structured em materials , left - handed ( lh ) meta - materials have been fabricated @xcite . this new kind of meta - materials were first speculated by veselago in 1967 , which characterized by simultaneous negative dielectric permittivity and negative magnetic permeability and therefore a negative refractive index in some frequency ranges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many anomalous effects can exist in such meta - materials , such as a reversed doppler shift , reversed cerenkov radiation , negative radiation pressure , and inverse snell - descarteds law . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most exciting applications of lh meta - materials is the possibility of a perfect lens whose image resolution is not subject to the limitations of the traditional diffraction limit of a wavelength @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , a periodic arrangement of lh meta - materials , namely lh photonic crystals , have become the object of intense experimental and theoretical interest @xcite . like </S>",
    "<S> polaritonic pcs whose @xmath1 is homogeneous while @xmath2 is frequency - dependent @xcite , the substitution of lh meta - materials into pcs is expected to introduce a whole range of exciting physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , a multilayer structure with stacking alternating layers of ordinary ( positive-@xmath3 ) and negative-@xmath3 materials can result in an omnidirectional zero-@xmath0 gap @xcite , where the defect modes are weakly dependent on the incident angles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in lh meta - materials are frequency - dependent @xcite . in a split ring resonator </S>",
    "<S> used to create negative magnetic materials , the magnetic permeability is normally expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the effective magnetic plasma frequency , @xmath6 is the frequency of the light and @xmath7 represents the light absorption @xcite . due to the dispersive properties of lh meta - materials , it brings a lot of difficulties to simulate high - dimensional lh pcs with the conventional method , such as plane - wave expansion method @xcite and finite - difference time - domain method @xcite .    here , using an extended plane - wave - based transfer - matrix method , whose details </S>",
    "<S> are presented in the appendix , the optical properties of high - dimensional lh pcs are studied . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental physical background of our method is : ( 1 ) divide the whole pc structure into thin slices along the @xmath8-axis direction , within each slice @xmath2 and @xmath1 are approximated as @xmath8-independent ( they can be @xmath9-dependent ) ; ( 2 ) it is assumed that each slice is surrounded by two thin air films with zero thickness ; ( 3 ) expression of the em field in the air films by bragg waves ; ( 4 ) expression of the em field in each slice by the eigenmodes in the slice ; ( 5 ) use of the boundary conditions between em fields in the slice and two neighboring air films to obtain the transfer matrix or the scattering matrix ; ( 6 ) use of the obtained matrix to calculate the transmission spectrum of the pc . </S>",
    "<S> the photonic band structure of the pc can thus be obtained by using bloch s theorem . </S>",
    "<S> since the independent variable in these calculations is frequency rather than wave vector , it can therefore effectively simulate lh pcs , even their magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity are all frequency - dependent and negative .    based on this approach , the photonic band structures and the corresponding spectrum of two - dimensional ( 2d ) lh pcs are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the 2d pc considered here is a square lattice of lh cylindric rods embedded in air background . for the sake of easy comparison , the electric permittivity @xmath10 and the magnetic permeability @xmath11 of the rods are adopted from ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the free electron expression of @xmath10 is assumed , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the frequency of bulk longitudinal electron excitations , and @xmath14 the parameters assumed are : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and the radius of the rod @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the lattice constant , @xmath20 is the speed of light in vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> note that the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath13 used here are @xmath22 of that used in ref.@xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) we plot the dependence on frequency @xmath23 of the parameters of the lh cylindric rods : @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly shown that : for frequency @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which means in this frequency region the meta - material is single - negative ; for @xmath28 , both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are negative , that is , the meta - material is left - handed ; for @xmath29 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which means the meta - material is single - negative again ; for @xmath30 , both @xmath11 and @xmath10 are positive , and the meta - material is right - handed . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath31 is also @xmath22 of the @xmath32 used in ref.@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the photonic band structures for the transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode along the @xmath33 direction are calculated and shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) , and the corresponding transmission spectrum along the same direction for a 16-layer structure are also calculated and shown in fig .  ( 3a ) . here , in frequency region @xmath25 and @xmath34 where the meta - materials are not lh , 101 plane waves are used , the cylindric rods are divided equally into 20 parts , and the increment frequency is @xmath35 ; while , for the left - handed region , that is , @xmath28 , 161 plane waves are used , the cylindric rods are divided equally into 50 parts , and the increment frequency is @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be expected that , by decreasing the increment frequency , which leads to more computational burden , more accurate results will be obtained .    comparing with the scattering resonances of a single lh cylindric rod shown in fig.(2b ) in ref.@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , there are two significant similarities between our periodic structure and the single rod : ( 1 ) many anti - crossing behavior exist and only exist in the band structures where the meta - materials are left - handed , which lead to the formation of very narrow band gaps and the appearance of sharp resonant peaks in the transmission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> similar results were obtained from the scattering resonances of the single lh rod @xcite , where resonances only exist in the frequency region where the cylindric rod is lh . </S>",
    "<S> the physical mechanism of the anti - crossing behavior in our periodic structure is same to that of the scattering resonances of the single rod , that is , the appearance of infinite surface polaritons @xcite ; ( 2 ) a narrow band gap exists around @xmath37 , corresponding to the valley in the transmission spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> notice that similar dip was also founded around the same place in the scattering resonances of the single rod @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is a direct result of the fact that the effective refractive index of the periodic structure around @xmath37 , which is roughly given by @xmath38/a^{2},\\ ] ] is only 0.8 . </S>",
    "<S> this value is very close to the refractive index of vacuum , therefore , the transmission rates around this narrow band gap is not zero , but still about 37% , as shown in fig.(3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on these two similarities , we can conclude that for a high - dimensional lh pc , just like a polaritonic pc , the band structure is governed primarily by the surface polaritons of a single rod , whose frequencies are determined by the rod s geometry , where the periodicity of the crystal will only introduce slight dispersion @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , four more significant features can be found from the band structures of our periodic structure : ( 1 ) a wide band gap , from 0 to @xmath39 , is shown in fig.(2 ) and fig.(3a ) , which is mainly due to the single - negative property of the meta - material , so em waves decays strongly when propagating through this structure ; ( 2 ) as shown in fig.(2 ) and fig.(3b ) , there exists a continual dispersion curve in the frequency region @xmath40 $ ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not so surprise to find that similar dispersion curves were reported in 2d polaritonic pcs , due to the fact that the meta - materials in this frequency region have the same optical properties as the polaritonic materials @xcite ; ( 3 ) a lot of near - dispersionless bands appear when the meta - materials are lh , which are direct results of the coupling between the localized surface polaritons of an isolated cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking feature of the near - dispersionless bands is that their group velocities are almost zero . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , where the meta - materials are lh , the dispersion curve seems continual , except distorted by a lot of anti - crossing , as clearly shown in fig.(3c ) and fig.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersion relation here has the same physical origin as that in @xmath43 $ ] , where the meta - material is single - negative with a negative @xmath10 and a positive @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> a direct evidence can be found from the unbroken band structure shown in the inset of fig.(2 ) , where the dispersion curve is continual from @xmath44 to about @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena can also be explained by the long - wavelength approximation , that is , when the wavelength of the propagating em wave is much longer than the lattice constant of pc , the dispersion relationship becomes approximately linear , and pc is effectively homogeneous under this circumstance . </S>",
    "<S> note that the effective refractive index of the lh meta - materials in this region is very close to zero , as shown in fig.(1b ) . in order to explain it more clearly </S>",
    "<S> , we plot the dispersion relationship of the effectively homogeneous structure in fig.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effective refractive index of the periodic structure used here is coarsely given by , @xmath46/a^{2}.\\ ] ] the dispersion relationship can be obtained by using the relation that @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> when plot it , we shift the frequency upwardly @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly shown that these two curves have similar slopes , which means the speed of the energy propagation ( given by @xmath49 ) is almost same in the effective structure and that in the periodic structure . hence , we can conclude that the long - wavelength approximation is validated here , and the group effective refractive index can be calculated by using eq.(4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that eq.(4 ) is very different with eq.(3 ) : the index obtained from last equation is always positive , in sharp contrast , the index calculated by the first one can be zero , or even negative .    </S>",
    "<S> when the average refractive index of a multilayer structure @xmath50 equals zero , where @xmath19 is the lattice constant , a band gap , namely zero @xmath0 gap , will appear in the band structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our 2d sample has also such zero @xmath0 gap around @xmath51 , as shown in fig.(5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the refractive index of the cylindric rods around this frequency is about @xmath52 , the average refractive index of the 2d pc , which is given by eq.(4 ) , is zero . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , in our case , the zero-@xmath0 gap is only one of many mini gaps induced by the anti - crossing behavior . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , around @xmath53 , a very sharp peaks with very narrow bandwidth is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( 5 ) , and the ratio between the peak frequency and the fwhm of the peak is as little as @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this property can be used to design narrow - band filter .    in conclusion , using an extended plane - wave - based transfer - matrix method , the photonic band structures and the corresponding transmission spectrum of a two - dimensional left - handed photonic crystal are calculated . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons between the periodic structure with a single left - handed cylindric rod are made , and many interesting similarities are found . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , due to the localized surface polaritons presented by an isolated left - handed rod , there exist many exciting physical phenomena in high - dimensional left - handed photonic crystals . as direct results of coupling of the localized surface polaritons of </S>",
    "<S> neighboring left - handed rod , a lot of almost dispersionless bands , anti - crossing behavior , and a zero @xmath0 gap are exhibited in the left - handed periodic structure . </S>",
