    "thermal dilepton production in the mass region below 1 gev / c@xmath1 is largely mediated by the light vector mesons @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . among these ,",
    "the @xmath0(770 mev / c@xmath1 ) is the most important , due to its strong coupling to the @xmath4 channel and its short lifetime of only 1.3 fm / c .",
    "changes both in width and in mass were originally suggested as precursor signatures of the chiral transition  @xcite and subsequent models have tied these changes directly  @xcite or indirectly  @xcite to chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the first na60 results focused on the space - time averaged spectral function of the @xmath0 @xcite ; more details were added recently  @xcite .",
    "the present paper concentrates mainly on new developments , in particular first results on acceptance - corrected @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra for different mass windows",
    "details of the na60 apparatus can be found in  @xcite , while the different analysis steps ( including the critical assessment of the combinatorial background from @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays through event mixing ) are described in  @xcite .",
    "the results reported here were obtained from the analysis of data taken in 2003 for in - in at 158 agev . the left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the opposite - sign , background and signal dimuon mass spectra , integrated over all collision centralities . after subtracting the combinatorial background and the signal fake matches ,",
    "the resulting net spectrum contains about 360000 muon pairs in the mass range 0 - 2 gev / c@xmath9 , roughly 50% of the total available statistics .",
    "the associated average charged - particle multiplicity density measured by the vertex tracker is @xmath10 = 120 .",
    "vector mesons @xmath2 and @xmath3 are completely resolved with a mass resolution at the @xmath2 of 20 mev / c@xmath1 .",
    "most of the analysis is done in four classes of collision centrality ( defined through the charged - particle multiplicity density ) : peripheral ( 4@xmath1130 ) , semiperipheral ( 30@xmath11110 ) , semicentral ( 110@xmath11170 ) and central ( 170@xmath11240 ) .",
    "the peripheral data can essentially be described by the expected electromagnetic decays of the neutral mesons  @xcite .",
    "this is not the case in the more central bins , due to the presence of a strong excess . to isolate this excess without any fits ,",
    "a novel procedure has been devised @xcite .",
    "the resulting spectrum for all centralities and all @xmath12 shows a a peaked structure residing on a broad continuum .",
    "the same feature can be seen for each centrality bin , with a yield strongly increasing with centrality , but remaining essentially centered around the position of the nominal @xmath0 pole .    a more quantitative analysis of the shape of the excess mass spectra _ vs. _",
    "centrality has been performed , using a finer subdivision of the data into 12 centrality bins  @xcite . on the basis of this analysis it is possible to rule out that the excess shape can be accounted for by the cocktail @xmath0 residing on a broad continuum , independent of centrality .     for different mass windows .",
    "right : rapidity distribution of the excess data for the mass window @xmath13  gev/@xmath14 and for three selected @xmath5 bins . the measured data ( full markers ) are reflected around midrapidity ( open markers).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   for different mass windows .",
    "right : rapidity distribution of the excess data for the mass window @xmath13  gev/@xmath14 and for three selected @xmath5 bins . the measured data ( full markers ) are reflected around midrapidity ( open markers).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a differential analysis in @xmath12 was originaly performed and mass spectra associated with three different @xmath12 windows , without acceptance correction , were obtained  @xcite .",
    "the na60 acceptance relative to @xmath15 as a function of @xmath12 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( left ) , implies that one should in principle perform the acceptance correction using a 3-dimensional grid in ( @xmath16 ) space .",
    "this can lead , however , to large errors once the correction is applied .",
    "instead , the correction is performed in 2-dimensional ( @xmath17 ) space , using the measured rapidity distribution as an input .",
    "the latter was determined with an acceptance correction found , in an iterative way , from monte carlo simulations matched to the data in @xmath18 and @xmath12 . on the basis of this rapidity distribution ,",
    "0.1 gev/@xmath19 bins in m and 0.2 gev/@xmath20 bins in @xmath12 were used to determine the remaining 2-dimensional correction . after correction",
    "the results were integrated over the three extended mass windows @xmath21 ,  @xmath13 and @xmath22 gev / c@xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right ) the rapidity distribution of the central mass window is shown for three different @xmath12 windows , exhibiting a close resemblance to the distribution of inclusive pion production , as measured by na49 for pb - pb and na60 for in - in .",
    "the results for the acceptance - corrected @xmath5 spectra are summarized in fig .",
    "the errors shown are purely statistical .",
    "systematic errors arise from the acceptance corrections including the rapidity distribution used , the subtraction of the cocktail , and the subtraction of the combinatorial background plus fake matches . for @xmath23 gev / c ,",
    "the combinatorial background contributes most , ranging from 10 to 25% for semiperipheral up to central . for @xmath24 gev / c ,",
    "the statistical errors dominate .",
    "the data show a significant dependence on mass , but hardly any on centrality . to bear out the differences in mass more clearly , the data were summed over the three more central bins and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( left ) as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "the inverse slope parameter @xmath26 as determined from differential fits of the @xmath6 spectra with @xmath27 , using a sliding window in @xmath5 , is plotted on the right .",
    "instead of flattening at very low @xmath6 as should be expected from radial flow , strikingly all spectra _ steepen _ , which is equivalent to very small values of @xmath26 . for comparison , the @xmath3 resonance , placed just in between the upper two mass windows ,",
    "does flatten as expected .",
    "moreover , depending on the fit region , @xmath26 covers an unusually large dynamic range .",
    "finally , the largest masses have the steepest @xmath6 spectrum , _ i.e. _ the smallest value of @xmath26 everywhere , again contrary to radial flow and to what is usually observed for hadrons .",
    "all this suggests that different mass regions are coupled to basically different emission sources .",
    "summarizing , the previously measured excess mass spectra and the new acceptance - corrected @xmath5 and @xmath6 spectra present an unexpected behaviour . beyond the @xmath0 spectral",
    "function this may lead to a better understanding of the continuum part of the spectra for @xmath28 gev / c@xmath9 , possibly disentangling parton - hadron duality .",
