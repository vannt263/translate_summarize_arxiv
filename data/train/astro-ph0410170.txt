    "the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) has produced remarkable images of circumstellar disks surrounding young stars . by far the largest population of known circumstellar disks is located in the orion nebula at a distance of 460 pc ( see bally et al .",
    "2000 ) , where the disks have typical diameters of 50 - 1000 au .",
    "odell , wen , & hu ( 1993 ) found several disks seen in silhouette against the background nebular light , and dozens of young stellar objects surrounded by teardrop- or tadpole - shaped ionization fronts .",
    "these are protoplanetary disks seen purely in silhouette , or externally - ionized photo - ablating protoplanetary disks ( `` proplyds '' ) , both rendered visible by their location in or near an h  ii region ( odell et al .",
    "1993 , 1996 ; mccullough et al .  1995 ; bally et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "mccaughrean & odell ( 1996 ) found six additional disks seen purely in silhouette against the bright nebular emission from the orion nebula .",
    "more detailed _ hst _ imaging studies of the nebular core revealed a total of 15 silhouette disks ( bally , mccaughrean , & odell 2000 ; mccaughrean et al .",
    "1998 ) and nearly 200 bright proplyds ( odell et al .  1993 ; odell & wong 1996 ; bally et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "some silhouette disks are seen embedded inside bright proplyds ( bally et al .",
    "2000 ) , where in some cases the disks glow in [ o  i ] and h@xmath5 emission ( chen et al .  1998 ; strzer & hollenbach 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , several one - sided `` microjets '' are associated with proplyds ( bally et al .",
    "2000 ; reipurth & bally 2001 ) , indicating that the embedded stars are still surrounded by active accretion disks .",
    "so far , only the inner portion of the orion nebula  a region that contains about 400 of the nearly 2,000 members of the extended trapezium cluster of low mass stars  has been completely surveyed with _",
    "however , odell ( 2001 ) presented hst images of several objects outside the nebular core , demonstrating that additional young stars , disks , and jets remain to be discovered in the outer regions of the orion nebula .    with the new wide field camera of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs / wfc ) installed on _ hst _ during the 2002 servicing mission",
    ", we explored the outer orion nebula where radiation fields are less intense than in the nebular core .",
    "the outskirts of the orion nebula contain young stars bathed in radiation fields that may be more typical of the environment in which most stars in the sky are born .",
    "the survey samples a large portion of the orion nebula cluster .",
    "our acs / wfc survey also included the first comprehensive _ hst _ imaging of the neighboring h  ii region m43 , several acrminutes north of the trapezium , powered by the single b0-type star nu ori .",
    "the new disks are seen despite the the fainter background nebular emission far from the trapezium . on the other hand ,",
    "the faint nebular background probably makes it easier to see extended emission from bipolar reflection nebulae and microjets emerging from the silhouette disks  phenomena which are apparently less common among pure silhouette disks in the inner orion nebula ( bally et al .",
    "2000 ) . after a general description of these new silhouette disks (  3 ) ,",
    "we provide more detailed investigations of two particularly interesting disks and their associated jets (  4 and  5 ) .",
    "one additional proplyd with a bipolar jet and silhouette disk , d181 - 826 and hh  540 , is also seen in our survey in the outer parts of the orion nebula , but has been discussed separately ( bally et al .",
    "2004 ) because of its remarkable morphology .",
    "the new acs / wfc observations reported here were extracted from images obtained as part of an h@xmath0 survey of the orion nebula and m43 during _ hst _ cycle 12 , using the f658n filter to cover 415 square arcminutes . the narrowband f658n filter transmits both h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] @xmath66583 in the nebula , although for simplicity we refer to it as an h@xmath0 filter .",
    "further details of the cycle 12 observations and data reduction procedures are given in an earlier paper in this series ( bally et al .",
    "2004 ) , and are not repeated here .",
    "in addition to these cycle 12 observations , we obtained acs / wfc images at four pointings during cycle 11 , using the f658n filter , the f660n filter which only transmits [ n  ii ] @xmath66583 , the f502n filter sampling [ o  iii ] @xmath65007 , and the f550 m continuum filter .",
    "these cycle 11 data , obtained on 2002 august 29 and 30 , led to the discovery of the d216 - 0939 silhouette disk ( see  4 ) , which was not observed during cycle 12 , and for measuring proper motions in the hh  668 jet associated with d253 - 1536 , which was observed in both cycle 11 and 12 ( see  5 ) .",
    "the cycle 11 observation strategy differed in minor ways from the cycle 12 program . for each pointing in the f658n filters during cycle 11 , two exposures with a duration of 500 seconds each",
    "were obtained with a two - point dither pattern in which the second exposure was offset from the first by 5@xmath3 toward both the east and the south .",
    "this two - point dither pattern served to fill the gap between the two 2048@xmath74096 pixel ccd arrays of the acs / wfc , and in the fields which were common to both exposures served to identify cosmic ray hits .",
    "table  1 lists the central coordinates and other parameters of the cycle 11 acs / wfc observations .",
    "figure 1 shows ten h@xmath0 images of silhouette disks extracted from our acs / wfc survey of orion ; each frame is 7@xmath77 .",
    "the name of each disk follows the coordinate - based naming convention of odell & wen ( 1994 ) , with the prefix `` d '' for disk .",
    "a few objects show evidence for either bipolar `` microjets '' ( see reipurth & bally 2001 ; bally et al .  2000 ) or reflection nebulae .",
    "since we obtained only narrowband h@xmath0 images for most objects , spectra are needed to distinguish reflection nebulae from jets .",

    "is seen roughly 5@xmath9 southwest of the trapezium outside the bright huygens region .",
    "the outer edge of the silhouette disk has a diameter of @xmath10@xmath29 ( 410 au ) .",
    "the disk has a length - to - width ratio of roughly 5 suggesting a high inclination , but it can not be purely edge - on since a bright central star is visible .",

    "an edge - on dark disk much like some other disks seen by _ hst _",
    "( padgett et al .",
    "1999 ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "2003 ) bisects the small nebula along p.a.@xmath130@xmath11 .",
    "the extended portions of the disk are difficult to see against the faint background nebula , with a diameter of roughly 0@xmath29 ( 410 au ) or more .",
    "two emission or reflection knots are distributed nearly symmetrically on either side of the disk along an east / west axis perpendicular to the disk .",

    "is found about 1@xmath155 north of the trapezium .",
    "the proplyd ionization front has dimensions of 1@xmath22@xmath72@xmath3 , with the brightest part of the front facing the trapezium .",
    "the disk has a diameter of @xmath10@xmath25 ( 230 au ) with a likely inclination angle of @xmath175@xmath11 , and shows faint emission from a bipolar reflection nebula or microjet emerging perpendicular to the major axis of the disk .",
    "this polar emission is brighter on the western side of the disk , suggesting that the western part of the polar axis is tilted toward us out of the plane of the sky .",
    "a faint protrusion in the proplyd on the western rim along the disk axis may mark the location of a shock powered by a jet .",
    "* d132 - 042 * ( figure 1@xmath16 ) .",
    "d132 - 042 has a similar size and inclination as the previous disk , d124 - 132 , it is also embedded in a bright proplyd , and is located near to it on the sky .",
    "it has a bipolar microjet that is very faint on the northern side of the disk , but is bright and extends at least 0@xmath24 to the south and intrudes into the disk on the southern side ( thus , this is probably the blueshifted part of the jet ) .",
    "there is another bright knot along the presumed jet axis 0@xmath27 south of the source , but this also appears to be the location of the surrounding proplyd ionization front .",
    "* d132 - 1832 * ( figure 1@xmath17 ) .",
    "bally et al .  (",
    "2000 ) discovered this large silhouette disk , located north of the trapezium near the edge of the bright inner orion nebula .",
    "it is discussed here because our acs / wfc h@xmath0 image provides new information in two respects .",
    "first , the new image has higher resolution and sensitivity than earlier wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) images , and shows that faint translucent material in the outer parts of the disk is apparently getting swept - back ( to the north ) by radiation pressure or a large - scale wind from the trapezium , located toward the south .",
    "second , the previous wfpc2 image obtained in cycle 6 ( 1998 apr 4 ) shows a very bright central star ( see the inset of figure 1@xmath16 ) , while the star has completely faded from visibility in our new acs image .",
    "the f656n filter of wfpc2 also samples h@xmath0 but is narrower than the f658n filter of acs ( i.e. the acs filter contains more continuum light ) .",
    "therefore , the central star is significantly variable , and it is unclear whether the change is caused by continuum or line emission .",
    "if the excess emission in the earlier wfpc2 image in 1998 is due to an h@xmath0 flare , then this emission line s intrinsic luminosity in the central source decreased by at least @xmath14@xmath710@xmath18 ergs s@xmath4 over a period of only 5 years .",
    "* d141 - 1952 * ( figure 1@xmath19 ) .",
    "the dark region between m42 and m43 harbors a star surrounded by a small disk seen in silhouette against the background nebular light .",
    "the disk has a major - axis diameter of roughly 0.7  and a minor - axis diameter of about 0.6(320@xmath7275 au ) , implying that its polar axis is tilted about 55 - 60  out of the plane of the sky , with the polar axis projected on the sky along a southeast / northwest direction .",
    "this disk is seen purely in silhouette , with no associated proplyd ionization front .",
    "* d216 - 0939 * ( figure 1@xmath20 ) . this giant silhouette disk and reflection nebula",

    "this remarkable object is discussed in more detail in  4 .    * d253 - 1536 * ( figure 1@xmath21 ) .",
    "this large silhouette disk is unique in that it is apparently part of a binary system embedded within a giant proplyd in m43 .",
    "this unusual disk and its associated proplyd and bipolar jet are discussed in detail in  5 .    * d280 - 1720 * ( figure 1@xmath22 ) .",
    "the southwestern part of m43 contains a star surrounded by a small disk seen in silhouette against the background nebular light .",
    "the disk has a major - axis diameter of roughly 0.8  and a minor - axis diameter of about 0.6(370@xmath7275 au ) , implying that its polar axis is tilted about 45 - 50  out of the plane of the sky .",
    "the disk axis faces roughly toward p.a.@xmath13280 .",
    "however , the orientation and inclination can only be measured to about 10% accuracy due to the presence of the central star whose point spread function ( psf ) makes the determination of the disk s minor diameter difficult .",
    "this disk is seen purely in silhouette , with no associated proplyd ionization front .",
    "* d347 - 1535 * ( figure 1@xmath23 ) .",
    "this small disk is located about 1@xmath9 north / northeast of nu ori in m43 .",
    "the disk is nearly edge - on , with an inclination of perhaps @xmath180@xmath11 .",
    "the disk diameter is roughly 0@xmath27 ( 320 au ) with the minor axis oriented along p.a.@xmath1345@xmath11=225@xmath11 .",
    "it has no identifiable central star , but does show clear evidence for a remarkable bipolar microjet or reflection nebula emerging perpendicular to the disk .",
    "although the northeast part of the jet is brighter , the southwest portion intrudes farther into the disk perimeter , suggesting that this part of the jet or reflection nebula is tilted toward us .",
    "there is no proplyd ionization front that can be associated with this silhouette disk .",
    "this nearly edge - on disk is seen in silhouette against the very faint diffuse nebular light north of the orion nebula and northwest of m43 .",
    "a star and compact reflection nebula occupy the middle of the disk , while a more diffuse reflection nebula is illuminated primarily on its eastern face .",
    "a bipolar jet emerges orthogonal to the disk , and faint emission nebulae farther from the star constitute part of a larger bipolar flow , hh 667 .",
    "this disk / jet system is discussed below .",
    "figure 2 shows a more detailed view of d216 - 0939 than is given in figure 1@xmath20 .",
    "we deconvolved the original cycle 11 images in each filter using 5 iterations of the lucy task in iraf , with observations of a bright star about 5@xmath3 away adopted for the nominal psf . with only 5 iterations",
    ", these deconvolved images did not yet have the signature artifacts from over - processing ( rings were seen around stars after about 15 iterations ) , and the resulting effective fwhm spatial resolution we achieved was @xmath10@xmath206 . in the 3-color image in figure 2@xmath8 , blue or white features are dominated by scattered starlight , while features that appear red / orange are dominated by h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] emission .    even though this object is seen against the extremely faint outer parts of the orion nebula , the _ hst _ image shows an unambiguous silhouette disk with a polar axis oriented at roughly 83@xmath11=263@xmath11 .",
    "the disk is shown best in the contour plot of h@xmath0 in figure 2@xmath12 , where the blue - tinted contours trace extinction of background light .",
    "it is clear from this deconvolved image that the disk cuts all the way across the reflection nebula , indicating that the apparent bridge between the east and west sides in figure 1@xmath20 was caused by the psf of _ hst_. the deepest extinction in the disk reaches down to @xmath12030% of the background nebula , corresponding to an optical depth of @xmath11.4 at 6563   and a grain column density of order 2@xmath710@xmath24 g @xmath25 , with standard assumptions about the grain properties .",
    "integrated over the surface of the disk , this would require a dust mass of order 1 @xmath26 , but of course this is only a lower limit since there could also be h@xmath0 emission along our line of sight to the disk , or additional mass hidden in denser optically - thick and unresolved parts of the disk .",
    "the diameter of the disk is at least 2@xmath26 ( 1200 au ) , but could be somewhat larger if there is a more diffuse component at larger radii that is difficult to detect against the very faint nebular background",
    ". the clear extinction of background light by the outer edge of the silhouette disk gives a reliable estimate of the disk diameter , and means that it is not simply a shadow cast by a smaller disk , as in the bipolar reflection nebula around the young star asr  41 in ngc  1333 ( hodapp et al .",
    "the gap between the east and west sides of the reflection nebula at 1@xmath31@xmath28 south of the central star may be this type of shadow , or it may indicate a larger diffuse disk not seen clearly in silhouette .",
    "this may be related to the fact that the silhouette disk appears somewhat asymmetric , having a size that is @xmath150% larger toward the north at the same contour level ( figure 2@xmath12 ) .",
    "the silhouette is also curved slightly , with the concave opening toward the east , resulting from the contamination of reflected light .",
    "the shape of the silhouette and the bright reflection nebula on its east - facing side indicate that the disk is flared ( consistent with the expected appearance in 2-d models ; whitney & hartmann 1992 ; whitney et al .",
    "2003a , 2003b ) , reaching latitudes of @xmath2713@xmath11 at its northern and southern extremities , where the projected width is about 0.6  or 275 au .",
    "our line of sight to the central star is apparently very close to the flared surface of the disk , requiring that we view the system at a latitude comparable to the flare angle ; thus , the disk axis is tilted by 10 - 15@xmath11 out of the plane of the sky , with the eastern portion facing toward us . this viewing geometry and the resulting asymmetric nebula",
    "are reminiscent of the reflection nebula around vy cma ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) , except that the disk of vy cma is not seen in silhouette . in the case of vy",
    "cma , the star is apparently viewed along a line of sight close to the surface of the disk , and the position of the central star is wavelength dependent ( smith et al .  2001 ; kastner & weintraub 1998 ) .",
    "however , in d216 - 0939 , the central emission peak is the same in the f550 m and f658n filters ( figure 2@xmath14 ) , suggesting either that the star is viewed more directly , or that the dust grains in the protoplanetary disk are large and do not strongly redden the visual - wavelength light ( see the discussion of the d114 - 426 disk by shuping et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the d216 - 0939 disk and its reflection nebula closely resemble the well - studied hh  30 system in the l1551 dark cloud in taurus ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1999 ) , although the physical dimensions of this disk in orion are several times larger than the hh  30 disk .",
    "this dark disk bisecting a bright reflection nebula is reminiscent of several other disks as well ( e.g. , padgett et al.1999 ; stapelfeldt et al .  1998 , 2003 ) .",
    "the brightness contrast between the east and west halves in d216 - 0939 is stronger than in the two halves of hh  30 ; this is consistent with our conjectured inclination of the disk ( with the axis tilted 10 - 15@xmath11 from the plane of the sky ) , since burrows et al .",
    "( 1996 ) derive a slightly smaller tilt angle of @xmath17@xmath285 ( closer to edge - on ) for hh  30 .",
    "as discussed below , the similarity of d216 - 0939 and hh  30 is even further exemplified by their bipolar hh jets .",
    "h@xmath0 emission from hh  667 is presumably excited by shocks , but if it is instead an irradiated jet , the discussion below remains valid .",
    "this emission traces a bipolar outflow from the young star embedded in the d216 - 0939 disk .",
    "the acs images reveal several knots near the central star , as well as more distant features about 30  to the east and west .",
    "_ hh 667 microjet _ : figure 2 shows a system of emission knots along an axis perpendicular to the disk plane , within 1@xmath3 from the central peak . one bright elongated knot is seen @xmath10@xmath25 east of the star , and two fainter emission knots are seen west of the star along the outflow axis at 0@xmath24 and 0@xmath29 from the central peak . these are best seen in the contour map in figure 2@xmath12 and the intensity tracing in figure 2@xmath14 .",
    "these knots are seen in h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] @xmath66583 line emission : they appear red / orange in the color image in figure 2@xmath8 , and the tracings in figure 3@xmath14 confirm that the h@xmath0 emission from the knots has a clear excess compared to scattered continuum light in the f550 m filter ( whereas the central star in h@xmath0 matches the continuum distribution ) .",
    "this object is far from the center of m42 or m43 , so if it is an irradiated jet or dominated by shock excitation , it is likely that the ionization fraction is low and that [ n  ii ] @xmath66583 makes a significant contribution to the emission in the f658n filter .",
    "therefore , we do not attempt to estimate the electron density from the h@xmath0 emission measure here .",
    "high resolution spectra that could separate these two emission lines and measure kinematics would be useful for assessing the mass - loss rate in the hh  667 microjet .",
    "_ hh 667 e _ : the eastern portion of this flow is marked by a partial bow shock located about 30  from the source .",
    "this feature is several arcseconds in extent and consists of two sharp - edged filaments resembling bow shocks moving eastward ( fig.3@xmath8 ) .",
    "very faint diffuse emission fills the interior of these bows on their western sides .",
    "the center of curvature of these partial bow shocks is @xmath111@xmath11 off axis , suggesting that the flow may be bent toward the south .",
    "_ hh 667 w _ : the western portion of the flow consists of several faint and diffuse filaments of emission elongated along the outflow axis , ranging from about 20  to 30  from the source ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "these features probably trace shocks within a faint jet .",
    "the components of hh  667  w are less than 1  wide in the direction perpendicular to the flow axis , but unlike the eastern part of the flow , they are not significantly off - axis compared to the bipolar microjet and disk of the central star .",
    "the maximum separation between the eastern and western components of the outflow from d216 - 0939 is 66  or about 0.15 pc in projection .",
    "altogether , the d216 - 0939 disk and its more extended hh  667 outflow closely resemble the well - studied hh  30 system in the l1551 dark cloud in taurus ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 ; stapelfeldt et al . 1999 ) .",
    "ground - based narrowband images of the h  ii region m43 revealed a compact globule with a central star embedded within the western rim of this nebula .",
    "the acs images ( figure 4 ) show that the object is in fact a proplyd ionization front or shock surrounding two stars separated by 1@xmath21 : the brighter star is visible on ground - based images , and near it is a fainter star embedded in a silhouette disk . the second object , d253 - 1536 , drives a microjet visible on one side of the disk , and the larger bipolar hh  668 jet that breaks - out on both sides of the proplyd s bright rim in a direction perpendicular to the disk .",
    "a bow shock ( hh  668  a ) is seen almost 1@xmath9 away from the central star to the south / southeast .",
    "the various components of d253 - 1536 and the hh  668 jet are summarized in figure 4 and are discussed below .      a 0@xmath26@xmath71@xmath24 disk seen in silhouette against background nebular emission of m43",
    "is located 1@xmath21 due east of the brighter star .",
    "assuming that the d253 - 1536 disk is circular , the axis of the disk is inclined by @xmath125@xmath11 with respect to the plane of the sky .",
    "however , the disk has pronounced asymmetry .",
    "the brightest pixel , presumably produced by a compact reflection nebula located somewhat south of the star s true location , is displaced from the disk center by about 0@xmath215  0@xmath22 toward the east .",
    "this distortion provides evidence that the bright star and the disk form a true physical pair in which the gravitational perturbations of the brighter and presumably more massive star generate the disk asymmetry .",
    "the d253 - 1536 disk is remarkable for being the secondary member of a binary system in which the primary is a brighter star that shows no indication of being surrounded by a visible disk .",
    "the secondary is decentered in its own circumstellar disk , but powers a remarkably straight bipolar jet ( see below ) , suggesting that the orbital period is much longer than the flow timescale in the visible jet .",
    "thus , the orbital timescale must be @xmath29100 yr .",
    "for the apparent separation of 1@xmath21 or a=@xmath13250 au , we find that the orbital period would be @xmath14,000 ( m / m@xmath30)@xmath31 yr , where m is the total mass of the binary system",

    "there is no evidence for a larger circumbinary disk around the system .",
    "both members of this binary system are embedded within a proplyd ionization front that faces directly toward nu orionis , the early b - type exciting star of the m  43 h  ii region .",
    "the bright rim s radius is about 3@xmath3 ( 1400 au ) , so the diameter of this object is comparable to some of the giant proplyd candidates seen recently in the carina nebula ( smith et al .",
    "the ionization front is highly structured and consists of a series of scalloped rims , perhaps signifying instabilities in a shock front rather than a smooth ionization front .",
    "an anonymous referee pointed out that this feature bears a remarkable resemblance to the bright cusp seen around the dark proplyd d114 - 426 ( odell & beckwith 1997 ) .",
    "a faint microjet ( see  5.3 ) emerges from the center of the disk on its south side , and its faint emission can be traced to the edge of the proplyd s bright rim about 4@xmath3 to the south ( fig .",

    "then , as it breaks out of the proplyd ionization front , the jet becomes brighter ( hh  668  s ) and can be traced for another 8@xmath3 toward the south along the same axis , which is perpendicular to the silhouette disk .",
    "although the jet blends into the background nebular light of m43 at this point , the flow continues farther to the south , since a bright bow shock is located 55@xmath3 south on the jet axis ( hh  668  a in figs .",

    "a line connecting hh  668  n and s passes directly through the center of the d253 - 1536 disk , and comes within a few degrees of the hh  668  a bow shock .",
    "thus , we do not detect major deflection of the jet by a large scale wind in m43 or precession of the jet due to orbital motion in the binary system , as mentioned above in  5.1 .",
    "however , proper motions do reveal some deviations from a purely linear jet ( see  5.4 ) .",
    "the n and s components of the hh  668 jet ( fig .",
    "4@xmath12 ) are brightest immediately outside the proplyd s bright cusp , implying that at least in this portion of the flow , hh  668 is an irradiated jet .",
    "figure 5 shows details of the hh  668 microjet emerging from d253 - 1536 . like",
    "most of the nearly two dozen microjets from proplyds in orion ( bally et al .",
    "2000 ) , it appears to be a one - sided jet where the counter - jet is faint and lost in the bright background nebular light .",
    "the jet is brightest on the southeast side of the disk , which may be more directly illuminated by nu  ori in the center of m43 .",
    "we obtained f658n images of d253 - 1536 during both cycles 11 and 12 ( 2002 august and 2004 january , respectively ) , allowing us to document temporal changes in the microjet structure .",
    "clear qualitative differences are seen in figures 5@xmath8 and 5@xmath12 : in 2002 august ( fig.5@xmath8 ) the hh  668 microjet shows one bright emission knot located roughly 0@xmath22 left of the star ( note that the images in fig .  5 are rotated so that the horizontal direction is along p.a.=170@xmath11 ) , while 513 days later in 2004 january ( fig .",
    "5@xmath12 ) two distinct knots are seen .",
    "if we assume that the second knot farther from the star in 2004 january is the same condensation as the single knot seen in 2002 august , then the centroid of this condensation has moved 0@xmath2195 , indicating a transverse velocity in the plane of the sky of roughly 300 km s@xmath4 . with the d253 - 1536 disk axis",
    "tilted @xmath125@xmath11 from the plane of the sky ( see  5.1 ) , the true speed of the hh  668 microjet is roughly 330 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this is on the high end compared to typical microjet speeds , and is significantly faster than downstream portions of the hh  668 jet ( see table 3 and  5.4 ) , implying that the flow decelerates when it interacts with the ambient medium or downstream jet material , as expected in conventional hh flows .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 surface brightness can be used to estimate the electron density of the knots in the hh  668 microjet , with the important caveats that this will be an underestimate if the jet is not fully ionized and an overestimate if there is significant contamination by [ n  ii ] @xmath66583 in the filter .",
    "@xmath66583 , as the required information is not yet available . to flux",
    "calibrate the images , we simply followed the standard calibration method for _ hst _ imaging data  i.e. , using the photflam and photbw values .",
    "] the electron density is given by    @xmath36    where @xmath37=4.89@xmath710@xmath38 @xmath39 is the emission measure in @xmath40 pc ( spitzer 1978 ) , and @xmath39 is the observed h@xmath0 surface brightness in ergs s@xmath4 @xmath25 arcsec@xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 is the typical emitting path length or the diameter of the jet in pc . from the tracings in figure",
    "5@xmath14 we see that a typical value for @xmath43 in the knots is @xmath12@xmath710@xmath44 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath25 @xmath4 arcsec@xmath41 , or @xmath458@xmath710@xmath44 ergs s@xmath4 @xmath25 arcsec@xmath41 integrated over the 37.2   effective width of the f658n filter . adopting a jet width of @xmath10@xmath21 or @xmath46=46 au",
    "as seen in images , we find @xmath474@xmath710@xmath48 @xmath49 .",
    "( again , this is probably a lower limit , since the calculation does not include a correction for the ionization fraction and because the jet width may be unresolved . )",
    "combining this electron density with the speed measured in proper motions can yield an estimate of the mass - loss rate of the microjet very close to the point of origin . to do this",
    ", we must consider that the observed emission knots may be either discrete blobs of gas , or may be shocks in an otherwise steady flow .",
    "in the first case , we must average the electron density over the distance between the knots , so likely values for the jet density are in the range 14@xmath710@xmath48 @xmath49 ( i.e. , adopting an appropriate pseudo filling - factor ) .",
    "the average mass - loss rate is given by    @xmath50    yielding @xmath513@xmath710@xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) m@xmath54 yr@xmath4 . since @xmath55=4@xmath710@xmath48 @xmath49 is an underestimate for the reasons stated above , the likely current mass loss rate in the hh  668 microjet is of order 10@xmath56 m@xmath54 yr@xmath4 .",
    "as noted above , we obtained _",
    "hst_/acs f658n images of d253 - 1536 and hh  668 in both cycle 11 and cycle 12 , allowing us to search for proper motion in the components of the hh  668 jet using the  difference - squared \" method ( e.g. bally et al .",
    "2002 ; hartigan et al.2001 ) optimized for the measurement of nebular proper motions .",
    "the two sets of images were obtained 513 days ( 1.4 years ) apart . at a distance of 460 pc assumed for this portion of the orion nebula , a one pixel ( 0@xmath205 )",
    "shift in this time interval corresponds to a velocity of about 75 km s@xmath4 . on bright and compact features ,",
    "our image comparison method can determine motions to an accuracy of about 0.1 to 0.3 pixels , or about 10 to 20 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the resulting proper motions for components of the hh  668 jet are listed in table  3 .",
    "figure 6 is similar to figure 4 , except that the proper motions of various knots measured by this method are over - plotted and subcomponents of the jet are labeled , corresponding to the names in table 3 . in figure 6@xmath8 , the arrows show the amount of motion extrapolated to 50 years , while in the close - up view in figure 6@xmath12 , the arrows correspond to motion in 20 years .    the bipolar jet emerging from the silhouette disk exhibits motions with velocities that decline from around 300 km s@xmath4  for the microjet within 1  of the central star ( see above ) to about 215 km s@xmath4  at a distance 10  south . a similar decline of more than 30% in the jet speed",
    "is seen toward the north .",
    "the hh  668 flow can be traced about 50  south to a prominent h@xmath0 bow shock ( hh  668a ) .",
    "faint wings of h@xmath0 emission sweep back along the western rim of this feature toward the source for more than 15 .",
    "a compact high - excitation region bright in [ o  iii ] @xmath65007 lies about an arcsecond upstream from the tip of the shock . the proper motion of the hh  668  a shock in h@xmath0 is about 140 km s@xmath4 toward the southeast ; this speed is sufficient to account for the excitation of the [ o  iii ] @xmath65007 emission line seen there .",
    "since hh  668  a is the only part of the flow showing detectable [ o  iii ] emission , this is probably the terminal bow shock .",
    "a fainter sub - arcsecond diameter knot of high proper motion material is located between the source and this bow shock about 40  south from the source ( hh  668  b ; see fig .",
    "6@xmath8 ) .",
    "this knot shows proper motions of about 110 km s@xmath4 along the hh  668 flow axis , but has no [ o  iii ] emission , so it is an internal working surface of the jet .",
    "a few other knots were seen upon blinking images at the two epochs , but these did not yield statistically significant results with our proper motion measurement technique .",
    "hh  668  a and b located relatively far from the source support a general trend of a systematic decline in the proper motions with increasing distance from the source .",
    "the proper motion vectors show evidence for a systematic deflection of the hh  668 bipolar outflow toward the east by about 10 .",
    "this mild deflection is unusual in that it is toward the source of ionizing radiation nu ori .",
    "a possible explanation for this behavior is that the motion of plasma within this portion of the m  43 h  ii region is dominated by the flow of material away from the western ionization front located just beyond the right edge of figure 4 .",
    "our _ hst_/acs imaging survey of the outer parts of orion and m43 yielded the discovery of 9 new disks seen in silhouette against faint background light , and they show important new details for one previously discovered silhouette disk . compared to other silhouette disks , several members of this new sample are unusual in that they show evidence for bipolar reflection nebulae or microjets .",
    "this may be a selection effect due to the fainter background levels far from the trapezium .",
    "two of the new disks in our sample are found in or near m43 and deserve special attention :    \\1 .",
    "d216 - 0939 is a nearly edge - on disk with a remarkable reflection nebula and a bipolar microjet that resembles the hh  30 disk / jet system in taurus .",
    "the disk is as large as the largest previously - known silhouette disk .",
    "it also drives the 0.15 pc long bipolar jet hh  667 .",
    "d253 - 1536 is also a very large silhouette disk , and is the only silhouette disk known so far to exhibit tidal distortions induced by a companion star in a binary system .",
    "it is located inside the m43 h  ii region , and is associated with a bright proplyd ionization front .",
    "the disk drives both a microjet and a larger 0.14 pc long bipolar jet called hh  668 .",
    "images taken during cycles 11 and 12 reveal detectable proper motions in the jet , with de - projected speeds as high as 330 km s@xmath4 . with an electron density of order 4@xmath710@xmath48 @xmath49 near the source ,",
