    "some fundamental open questions regarding the nature of the universe concern its geometry and topology .",
    "they are the subject of many articles ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for example ) in which models are compared with observations which are more accurate over the years . about geometry , after nine years of investigation ,",
    "the data by wmap ( wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ) mission have provided strong evidence suggesting that the universe is nearly flat , with the ratio of its total matter - energy density to the critical value very close to one @xcite , but without fixing the sign of its curvature .",
    "the poincar dodecahedral space ( pds ) is a plausible multi - connected universe model with positive spatial curvature .",
    "more precisely , pds is the quotient of the unit 3-sphere @xmath1 by the group @xmath2 of covering isometries .",
    "the local geometry of the universe is described by a friedmann - lematre metric , so pds ( denoted by @xmath3 in equations ) is endowed with the spherical metric @xmath4 induced by @xmath5 .",
    "it is a three dimensional @xmath6 compact manifold , without boundary .",
    "such a manifold can conveniently be converted to a description as a fundamental domain .",
    "it will have the shape of a dodecahedron , with pairs of faces identified .",
    "many authors have studied pds ( @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a stationnary approach has been used in all these articles : the exact knowledge of the eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath7 on pds allows them to predict some results ( for example the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies ) , and to compare with the wmap observations .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the time approach previously developed in @xcite , where we studied a toy model of hyperbolic universe . among several advantages ,",
    "this method could be extended to investigate numerically the non - linear dynamics .",
    "the construction of pds is detailled in the next section .",
    "in the third part we get a practical description of the particular fundamental domain @xmath8 that contains @xmath9 of @xmath10 , and also we get a numerical description of the projection @xmath11 of @xmath8 in @xmath12",
    ". we mainly use the quaternionic calculus .",
    "next we consider the scalar wave operator @xmath13 on the dodecahedral universe @xmath14 .",
    "then , we compute the solutions of the wave equation in the time domain , by using a variational method and a discretization with finite elements .",
    "the domain of calculus is @xmath11 , therefore the initial cauchy problem on the manifold without boundary @xmath3 , becomes a mixed problem on @xmath11 with suitable periodic boundary conditions on @xmath15 .",
    "these boundary constraints are implemented in the choice of the basis of finite elements .",
    "we validate our results by performing a fourier analysis of the transient waves that allows to find a lot of eigenvalues of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath7 on pds .",
    "to be able to perform computations on pds we need to describe it accurately .",
    "this section recalls the properties of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath16 that we need to know .",
    "the 3-sphere is the submanifold of four - dimensional euclidean space such that @xmath17 .",
    "the comoving spatial distance @xmath18 between any two points @xmath19 and @xmath20 on @xmath1 is given by : @xmath21\\ ] ] we also use the parametrisation : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "these parametrisation leads to a convenient way to visualize @xmath1 : two balls in @xmath12 glued together by their boundary .",

    "for the second ball @xmath29 runs from @xmath31 at the surface through @xmath32 at the center .",
    "we use a projection @xmath33 of @xmath1 in @xmath12 : @xmath34 that is to say , to represent a point of coordinates @xmath35 of @xmath1 , we consider only the coordinates @xmath36 and discard @xmath37 .",
    "the two points of coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 have the same coordinates @xmath40 ; they are represented by the same point . in the sequel , for any @xmath41",

    "for any @xmath53 in the multiplicative group of unit quaternions @xmath47 we consider @xmath60 defined by @xmath61 .",
    "it fixes the identity quaternion @xmath62 , so in effect its action is confined to the equatorial 2-sphere spanned by the remaining basis quaternions @xmath63 .",
    "thus , by viewing @xmath12 as the space of pure imaginary quaternions , subspace of @xmath50 with basis @xmath64 , we get a rotation in @xmath12 .",
    "so @xmath65 belongs to @xmath66 .",
