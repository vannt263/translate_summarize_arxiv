    "the arrival directions of the icecube detected neutrinos are consistent with isotropic distribution @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray observations of diffuse galactic emission and individual galactic point sources by fermi - lat suggest that galactic neutrino flux can not account for the total flux icecube detects @xcite .",
    "these hint that the icecube neutrinos are extragalactic origin , although some fraction could be galactic origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . however , using the fermi - lat observations of those potential sources and simply assuming the gamma - ray to neutrino flux ratio is constant , @xcite suggested that gamma - ray bursts and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) may not account for the icecube neutrino flux , but starburst galaxies are still possible .",
    "blazars are a class of the strong candidate sources .",
    "they are the active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets pointing toward us , consisting of two subclasses , bl lac objects and fsrqs .",
    "it is expected that the crs produced by the jet interact with photons from or outside of the jet can produce pions and hence neutrinos .",
    "many discussions are going on after the icecube detection for whether blazars can account for the icecube neutrinos @xcite .    in this work",
    "we try to use the observations of gamma - rays and neutrinos from blazars to test if blazars can generate the bulk of the diffuse pev neutrino flux icecube detects .",
    "first , besides the detection of diffuse he neutrinos , icecube has also carried out deep search of neutrinos from individual astrophysical objects , including three groups of bright blazars @xcite . no signal is found but strong constraint is put on the ability of neutrino production in blazars .",

    "we assume a connection between the cr and bolometric radiation luminosity from the jet , following @xcite . since we focus on the neutrino flux at pev , we care more about the cr production at @xmath4  pev .",
    "we define the cr luminosity from the jet at @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the bolometric radiation luminosity of the jet , and @xmath8 is the cr loading factor for crs at @xmath9pev .",

    "dominate the production of pev neutrinos for fsrqs , thus only eq ( [ eq : blr ] ) is relevant for the calculation of @xmath19 . using the observational limit in stacking search , eq ( [ eq : stackinglimit ] ) , we obtain an upper limit to the cr loading factor ; @xmath73 as for the total cr loading factor , we have @xmath74 for flat cr spectrum , @xmath14 .    with the same method",
    "we also constrain @xmath8 based on the upper limit that icecube put on the neutrino flux of the 27 lsp bl lacs , for which the gamma - ray properties have been shown in table b.7 of @xcite . the 90% confidence level upper limit for the @xmath67 flux is @xcite @xmath75 . in the calculation of neutrino flux from individual sources , we consider neutrino production from both blr and blazar zone , but the contribution from blazar zone is much smaller , thus the constraint on @xmath8 mainly results from the blr neutrinos .",
    "our result gives @xmath76 , and hence @xmath77 . the constraint is weaker because lsp bl lacs are weaker neutrino producers .",
    "we do not expect fsrqs and bl lacs are different in cr production mechanisms , so the cr loading factors should depend on some intrinsic physics of the jets . in the following we can use the more stringent constraint eq ( [ eq : cr loading factor ] ) for blazars , both fsrqs and bl lacs , to calculate their contribution to the diffuse neutrinos .",
    "since the blazar neutrino luminosity @xmath78 can be calculated as above given the gamma - ray luminosity @xmath60 and the cr loading factor @xmath8 , the all - sky neutrino flux from all blazars should depend on the redshift and gamma - ray luminosity distribution of blazars , which has been measured recently thanks to the deep all - sky survey by fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "the observed diffuse neutrino intensity is given by @xmath79 following @xcite , here we consider the blazar density @xmath80 ( per unit comoving volume per unit luminosity ) as function of not only the redshift @xmath81 and gamma - ray luminosity @xmath60 , but also the spectral photon index @xmath82 in gamma - rays .",
    "for the cosmology we take @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "we use the luminosity - dependent density evolution ( ldde ) model for the density function @xmath86 of blazars , which gives the better fit to the fermi - lat data .",

    "we neglect the neutrino production in blr for hsp and isp bl lacs , because of weak or lacking broad line emission from them .",

    "the last column is the fraction of the blazar diffuse neutrino intensity in the icecube detected one ( eq . [ eq : ic diffuse ] ) .",
    "we have used three observational results to constrain the diffuse pev neutrino intensity from blazars , i.e. , ( 1 ) the constraint of neutrino flux from known blazars in stacking searches by icecube , ( 2 ) the measured gamma - ray flux from these known blazars by fermi - lat , and ( 3 ) the density distribution of blazars in the unverse measured by fermi - lat .",
    "we first use results ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) to constrain the cr loading factor @xmath8 of fsrqs .",
    "the result indicates that the total cr loading is smaller than usually expected , @xmath100 for flat cr spectrum .",
    "given that the physics of cr production in blazar jet is expected to be intrinsically the same , the constraint of @xmath8 is used to bl lacs as well . with result ( 3 )",
    "we then derive the diffuse pev neutrino intensity from blazars ( table [ table : diffuse ] ) .",
    "we find that blazar neutrinos , dominated by fsrqs , can only contribute @xmath1 of the diffuse pev neutrino intensity ( eq . [ eq : ic diffuse ] ) .",
    "the conclusion is consistent with the result by simply assuming constant ratio of neutrino to gamma - ray flux from blazars @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the uncertainties in our derivation of the diffuse neutrino flux from blazars .",
    "first , we simply assume that the cr loading factor @xmath8 is a constant , which may not be true .",
    "there have been some research shows that the radiative efficiency may be lower for higher luminosity @xcite , which implies that @xmath8 may weakly increase with @xmath7 @xcite and hence @xmath60 .",
    "the blazars in the stacking searches of neutrinos by icecube are mostly bright blazars , i.e. , with high gamma - ray luminosity , thus the constraint to @xmath8 ( eq . [ eq : cr loading factor ] ) is mainly valid to bright blazars .",
    "if the weak blazars are with smaller @xmath8 then the derived upper limit to the diffuse neutrino intensity from blazars is even lower , since the main contribution comes from lower luminosity blazars .",
    "this leads to even stronger conclusion that blazars can not contribute to the icecube detection .",
    "second , the cr loading factor for bl lacs may be different from that of fsrqs",
    ". however it should be @xmath101 times larger than constrained by stacked fsrqs , in order for bl lacs to account for the icecube flux .",
    "the constraint from 27 lsp bl lacs , @xmath76 , does not agree so .",
    "third , there is uncertainty in the measured blazar density distribution @xmath102 .",
    "however , this only leads to the uncertainty of the derived total neutrino intensity similar to that of derived gamma - ray background intensity , a factor of @xmath103@xcite .",
    "forth , some parameter values have been fix in the calculation .",
    "the @xmath104 value affects the constraint on @xmath8 , but it is canceled out in deriving the diffuse neutrino flux .",
    "the values of @xmath41 and @xmath50 do affect the calculation of all - sky flux from blazar zone , which is , however , far smaller than the icecube flux , by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "finally , there may be effect from the model uncertainty of the relations between @xmath60 and the other luminosities .",
    "the constraint of @xmath8 with fsrq catalog does depend on determinations of @xmath57 and @xmath7 , however , as seen by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : cr loading factor ] ) and ( [ eq : diffuse ] ) , the dependence is largely canceled out in deriving the diffuse intensity of blr neutrinos .",
    "so the limit on the all - sky blazar flux of blr neutrinos is hardly affected by the uncertainty in determining @xmath57 and @xmath7 .",
    "note the relations of @xmath57 and @xmath7 with @xmath60 hardly depend on the adopted blazar sequence model , which is still under debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the relation of @xmath58 with @xmath60 does , thus leads to uncertainty in deriving the diffuse flux of blazar zone neutrinos . however the uncertainty of @xmath58 should be within order of magnitude , which does not change the conclusion that the blazar zone neutrino flux is many orders of magnitude smaller than icecube detected .",
    "our conclusion appears to be in conflict with some recent results .",
    "it is recently reported @xcite that a high - fluence outburst of a fsrq , pks b1424 - 418 , occurred in temporal and positional coincidence with the third pev neutrino event detected by icecube , indicating a direct physical association between them .",
    "the about 1-yr outburst duration and the icecube effect area imply that the pev neutrino flux is comparable to the gamma - ray flux during the outburst , @xmath105 @xcite",
    ". however , this seems to be in conflict with two observational results : ( 1 ) as pointed out by @xcite , the icecube detected diffuse neutrino flux ( 20tev-2pev ) is only 4% of the diffuse gamma - ray flux ( 0.1 - 100gev ) from fsrqs ; and ( 2 ) the stacking analysis by icecube for the catalog of 33 fsrqs even shows that the neutrino flux @xcite is only @xmath106 of their gamma - ray one ( see table [ table : stacking ] ) .",

    "all flux is in unit of @xmath117 .",
    "the detailed lists of the three catalogs , 33 fsrqs , 27 lsp bl lacs and 37 hard gamma - ray spectrum bl lacs , are shown in tables b.6 , b.7 and b.8 , respectively , of @xcite .",
    "one may argue that the physical condition of the jet may change with the outburst , especially the cr loading power . in the outburst , with eq .",
    "( [ eq : individual flux ] ) one finds @xmath118 , a factor @xmath119 larger than usual . since @xmath60 increases by 15 - 30 in the outburst @xcite , the cr luminosity ( @xmath120 ) increases at least by ( 2 - 4)@xmath121 s accordingly , which is a dramatically large contrast .",
    "pks b1424 - 418 is indeed in the fsrq catalog for the track event search , with much larger effect area than the hese analysis at the source location , so it is important to see if more pev events can be found in the track - event data during the outburst .",
    "it is also suggested that for bl lacs as a class to explain the pev neutrinos detected by icecube , the neutrino flux from bl lacs is required to be comparable or larger than the gamma - ray flux above 10 gev , @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "however , the comparison of fermi - lat and icecube observations to two catalogs of bl lacs ( table [ table : stacking ] ) shows that the bl lac neutrino flux is , on the contrary , smaller than their gamma - ray one .",
