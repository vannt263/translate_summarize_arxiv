    "the traditional cosmology has been revolutionized by modern sophisticated observation techniques in distant type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) ( e.g. riess et al . 1998 ; schmidt et al . 1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations ( e.g. bennett et al . 2003 ; spergel et al . 2003 ) , and large - scale structure ( lss ) ( e.g. allen et al .",

    "2004a , ghirlanda relation hereafter ) , grbs are towards more and more standardizable candles",
    ". however , these relations in grbs have not been calibrated by a low-@xmath13 grb sample , so one should look for a method which is different from the `` classical hubble diagram '' method in sne ia .",
    "the luminosity relations with the variability and spectral lag make grbs a distance indicator in the same sense as cepheids and sne ia , in which an observed light - curve property can yield an apparent distance modulus ( dm ) .",
    "schaefer ( 2003 ) considered these two relations for nine bursts with known redshifts and advocated a new cosmographic method ( hereafter method i ) for grbs .",
    "in method i , one first calibrates the two relations with the observed sample for a certain cosmology , and then applies the best - fit relations back to the observed sample to obtain a @xmath16 or a probability @xmath17 for this cosmology .",
    "similar to the brightness of sne ia , the energy reserviors in grb jets are also clustered , but they are not fine enough for precise cosmology ( bloom et al .",

    "2004a ; lamb et al .",
    "in addition , it also holds within a grb ( liang , dai & wu 2004 ) .",
    "the ghirlanda relation is written as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are dimensionless parameters .",
    "theoretical explanations of this relation include the standard synchrotron mechanism in relativistic shocks ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; dai & lu 2002 ) together with the afterglow jet model , or the emission from off - axis relativistic jets ( yamazaki , ioka & nakamura 2004 ; eichler & levinson 2004 ; levinson & eichler 2005 ) .",
    "this relation could also be understood due to comptonization of the thermal radiation flux that is advected from the base of an outflow in the dissipative photosphere model ( e.g. rees & mszros 2005 ) .",
    "if these explanations are true , the ghirlanda relation appears to be intrinsic .",
    "thus , dai , liang & xu ( 2004 ; dlx04 ) considered the ghirlanda relation for 12 bursts and proposed another cosmographic method ( hereafter method ii ) for grbs . in method ii , one makes marginalizations over the unknown parameters in the ghirlanda relation to obtain a @xmath16 or a probability @xmath17 for a certain cosmology . following schaefer s method , ghirlanda et al .",

    "the most prominent observational evidence for a grb jet is its temporal break in their afterglow light curves .",
    "for some bursts , e.g. , grb030329 , their temporal breaks are observed in both optical and radio bands .",
    "berger et al . ( 2003 ) argued that these two breaks are caused by the narrow component and wide component of the jet in this burst , respectively , indicating that the physical origins of the breaks in the optical band and in the radio band are different .",

    "if the low-@xmath13 calibration is realized for grbs , then the solid confidence regions in fig 6 will become smaller so that they lie in the part of cosmic acceleration at a high c.l . in the @xmath178 plane ( not shown in this work ) .",
    "we here present a rough estimation of the detection rate of low-@xmath13 bursts in the _ swift _ era .",
    "taking @xmath11 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , the observed rate of bursts with redshift less than @xmath13 is @xmath183 where @xmath184 is the comoving grb rate density , and @xmath185 is the isotropic comoving volume element , @xmath186 ^ 2 \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt { \\omega _ m ( 1 + z)^3   + \\omega _ \\lambda   } } } .\\ ] ] we assume @xmath187 , where @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the comoving rate densities of core - collapse supernovae and star formation , respectively ( porciani & madau 2001 ) .",
    "we also assume the constant fraction @xmath190 , which considers the grb formation efficiency out of the core - collapse sne and the grb beaming effect .",
    "additionally , we take @xmath191 .",
    "the global star formation rate for the einstein - de sitter universe ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) is @xmath192 thus , we derive the detective probability of low-@xmath13 grbs in the _ swift _ era ( 2@xmath784 years ) : when @xmath193 , there will be @xmath194 burst ; and when @xmath195 , there will be a few bursts .",
    "these results agree with the present observational grb data .",
    "in addition , taking into account possible different origins of very low-@xmath13 bursts ( e.g. grb980425 ) and high-@xmath13 bursts , it might not be valid to directly apply the low-@xmath13 calibrated relation to a high-@xmath13 sample .",
    "however , if the cosmic evolution of the `` standard candle '' relation is ignored , then in the future one could consider a sample of grbs with redshift @xmath195 for the low-@xmath13 calibration .",
    "as the zero - order approximation , the theoretical luminosity distance of such a grb sample can be written as @xmath196 .",
    "at present , grbs with known redshifts are about 45 out of a few thousands , among which 17 are available to derive the ghirlanda relation .",
    "this relation is so tight that it has been considered for the cosmological use .",
    "although the low-@xmath13 calibration of the ghirlanda relation is not realized , the observed 17 high-@xmath13 bursts still provide interesting and even inspiring results .",
    "we find grbs independently place a constraint on the mass density @xmath197 ( @xmath6 ) for a flat @xmath7cdm model .",
    "grbs are becoming more and more standardized candles . through the ghirlanda relation ,",
    "the mean scatter in grbs is a factor of @xmath133 larger than that in sne ia .",
    "however , the disadvantage of larger scatter in grbs is compensated , to some extent , by their advantages of high redshifts and immunity to the dust extinction .",
    "the shape of the constraints in fig 6 implies that grbs could not only measure the mass density @xmath64 but also provide complementarity to the sn cosmology .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite is hopeful to establish a large grb sample with known redshifts , perhaps including low-@xmath13 bursts . in this sense , the grb cosmology now lies in its babyhood .",
    "a reliable theoretical basis of the ghirlanda relation is also important for grbs as a cosmic ruler . using the small angle approximation for all bursts",
    ", a scaling analysis gives @xmath198 ( @xmath199 ) as long as the parameters such as the spectral index @xmath200 of the distribution of accelerated electrons , the the energy equipartition factor @xmath201 of the electrons , the energy equipartition factor @xmath202 of magnetic field , the bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 , etc . , or their combinations are clustered ( zhang & mszros 2002 ; dai & lu 2002 ; wu , dai & liang 2004 ) .",
    "this power - law relation could also be understood by the emissions from off - axis relativistic jets ( yamazaki , ioka & nakamura 2004 ; eichler & levinson 2004 ; levinson & eichler 2005 ) and the dissipative photosphere model ( rees & mszros 2005 ) .",
    "different plausible explanations imply that this topic needs further investigations .",
    "it should be pointed out that the ghirlanda relation is obtained under the framework of the uniform top - hat jet model .",
    "other input assumptions include the uniform circumburst medium density @xmath31 and the constant efficiency @xmath30 of converting the initial ejecta s kinetic energy into @xmath0-ray energy release .",
    "however , @xmath31 and @xmath30 should be different from burst to burst , and @xmath31 is variable for a burst in the wind environment ( dai & lu 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath203 in the ghirlanda relation might not be clustered for the observed bursts ( friedman & bloom 2004 ) .",
    "new relations with as few well - observed quantities as possible are required for improvement - ray energy and the @xmath204 peak energy by considering the break time of an afterglow light curve . clearly , these three quantities are directly observed . ] . in this paper , for those bursts with unknown @xmath31",
    ", we assumed @xmath113 as the median value of the distribution of the measured densities , together with a constant fractional uncertainty of @xmath114 ( ghirlanda et al .",
    "2004a ; dlx04 ) .",
    "we also treat @xmath52 and @xmath53 for all the 17 bursts .",
    "finally , the ghirlanda relation is not valid for all the observed batse sample .",
    "this implies that this relation may suffer from the data selection effect ( band & preece 2005 ) .",
    "its validity will be tested by the ongoing observations of the _ swift _ mission . however , no matter whether the low-@xmath13 sample is established or not , the grb cosmology is expected to progress much in the coming years .",
