    "<S> the interpenetrability of two stars is governed by the number of arms ( or functionality ) @xmath0 , i.e. the number of linear polymer chains attached to a central microscopic core . for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> one recovers a system composed only of linear chains while in the limit @xmath2 one gets sterically - stabilized spherical colloidal particles which behave like effective hard spheres @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent research @xcite has mainly focussed on polymer conformations of a _ single _ star . </S>",
    "<S> the only relevant length scale of a single star is embodied in the spatial extension of the monomers around the core as given by the so - called corona diameter @xmath3 .    in order to predict macroscopic properties of a _ concentrated _ solution of </S>",
    "<S> _ many _ stars , one has , however , to proceed one step further : in any statistical theory , the effective interaction between the stars is a necessary input . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction , in general , comprises many - body terms . for concentrations which are not too high , i.e. smaller than or comparable to the overlap concentration @xmath4 , triplet and higher - order terms are small and the system is dominated by effective pairwise interactions . </S>",
    "<S> recently , based on scaling theory @xcite , an explicit analytical expression for the effective pair potential @xmath5 was proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> this potential combines a logarithmic form of the interaction potential for core - core separations @xmath6 smaller than @xmath3 with an exponentially decaying interaction of yukawa - form for distances @xmath6 larger than @xmath3 : @xmath7 note that the potential strength simply scales with the thermal energy @xmath8 since the repulsion between the stars is of purely entropic origin having a good solvent in mind . both , the potential in eq [ potential ] and its associated force @xmath9 are continuous at @xmath10 , but @xmath11 has an artificial cusp at @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the prefactor of the logarithm is fixed by scaling theory @xcite while the exponential decay length @xmath12 is the diameter of the outermost blob within the daoud - cotton model for one star polymer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for an arm number of @xmath13 , this potential was tested against neutron scattering data and reasonable agreement was found @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further experimental support comes from shear moduli measurements in the crystalline phase of many - arm - micelles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , the scaling theory assumptions are strictly speaking only justified for core - core distances @xmath6 much smaller than @xmath3 , and the exponential decay length of the outermost blob size is an heuristic assumption . </S>",
    "<S> hence the validity of the potential for arbitrary arm numbers can be questioned . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we test the pair potential against a microscopic model , resolving the monomers of the chains , by extensive molecular dynamics computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> to be specific , we use a simulation model for star polymers developed by grest et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which was applied in previous studies for single stars , and generalize it to a situation with two stars , which is the minimal set - up to extract information about the effective interaction between two stars . </S>",
    "<S> the distance - resolved interaction force @xmath11 is calculated for arm numbers @xmath0 ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> each arm contains @xmath16 monomers where @xmath16 is varied from @xmath17 to @xmath18 . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm the phenomenological interaction potential in eq [ potential ] ; our simulation results are in perfect _ quantitative _ agreement with the theoretical prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this important result enables a mapping of a star polymer solution onto a classical one - component fluid @xcite interacting via the effective ultra - soft pair potential of eq [ potential ] , provided the star concentration does not exceed @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this picture was anticipated in recent work , calculating the anomalous structure factor of star polymer solutions @xcite and the unusual phase diagram including re - entrant melting @xcite and anisotropic crystal structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , our present work provides a theoretical justification of all these previous studies .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first describe the simulation model @xcite : each polymer arm consists of @xmath16 effective monomers or  beads \" interacting via a purely repulsive lennard - jones - like potential @xmath20 , where @xmath6 is the separation of the beads . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is obtained from the usual lennard - jones potential @xmath21 by cutting @xmath21 at the position of the potential minimum @xmath22 and by shifting it by the constant value @xmath23 in order to obtain @xmath24 : @xmath25                      & ; $ r\\leq 2^{1/6}\\sigma_{lj}$               \\cr                     0 & ; $ r>2^{1/6}\\sigma_{lj}$               \\cr}\\ ] ] here , @xmath26 sets the energy scale and @xmath27 the length scale of the beads . </S>",
    "<S> the pure repulsion implies that we are dealing with a good solvent . for neighbouring beads along the chains , </S>",
    "<S> the attractive fene - potential @xcite @xmath28 is added to the interaction @xmath29                     & ; $ r\\leq r_{0}$               \\cr                     \\infty & ; $ r > </S>",
    "<S> r_{0}$               \\cr}\\ ] ] this interaction diverges at @xmath30 , which determines the maximum relative displacement of two neighbouring beads . </S>",
    "<S> henceforth , we fix @xmath31 to be @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> then the total potential @xmath33 between neighbouring monomers has a minimum at @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the central core particles of the two stars have a finite hard core radius @xmath35 , and all monomers are interacting with the core particles via a modified repulsive interaction potential @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of a small hard core of the central particles of the stars is necessary to accommodate the large number of arms at small distances from the core @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we take explicitly for the potential @xmath37 in addition , the innermost monomers of each arm are interacting with their core via an attractive potential which is given by @xmath38 we note that exactly this simulation model was already used by grest et al . in their simulations of single star polymers @xcite . in our simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the centers of the two stars are fixed at positions @xmath39 and @xmath40 with a given distance @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of mobile monomers is @xmath42 , which limits our studies to small @xmath0 and small @xmath16 . in all simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the system is held at fixed temperature @xmath43 . under these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the effective force @xmath44 acting on the @xmath45th star center is given as a canonical average @xmath46 where in the first sum the repulsive interactions of the core with _ all _ @xmath42 monomers in the system are considered , whereas the second sum only accounts for the attractive interactions with the @xmath0 innermost monomers of the chains attached to the @xmath45th center . obviously , due to symmetry , @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> we use standard molecular dynamics simulations @xcite to equilibrate the monomers and perform the statistical average @xmath48 over the monomers for the forces on the star centers . </S>",
    "<S> the timestep is typically @xmath49 ( with @xmath50 being the associated time unit and @xmath51 the monomer mass ) and typically @xmath52 steps are used for equilibration and up to @xmath53 steps were simulated to gather statistics . </S>",
    "<S> it was carefully checked by monitoring the internal energy that the system had equilibrated . a typical snapshot of two stars after equilibration is shown in figure [ snapshot.plot ] . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , the monomers of one star do not penetrate much into the central region of the other star .    in order to check the code </S>",
    "<S> , we performed simulations of single stars changing the arm numbers between @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the monomer numbers from @xmath54 to @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results for the radius of gyration @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the center of mass of the whole star ) and the density profile of the monomers are in very good agreement with the results given in ref and are well described by the scaling theory of daoud and cotton @xcite . for a detailed list of the simulation parameters and the results for @xmath58 , obtained from these single star simulations , see table [ parameters.table ] .    it should be noted that the effective forces on the star centers are the gradient of the _ effective _ star - star potential . </S>",
    "<S> this effective potential , however , differs in general from the monomer averaged potential energy of the star centers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore had to calculate the averaged forces @xmath44 ( @xmath59 ) from our two star simulations to compare with the theoretical force as calculated from eq [ potential ] . in doing this </S>",
    "<S> , two difficulties are arising : i ) the corona diameter @xmath3 , which is the relevant length scale in the potential of eq [ potential ] , is not known _ a priori_. ii ) in contrast to the theory , there is a finite core size @xmath35 in our simulation model .    as regards the first difficulty , @xmath3 is usually defined as the typical maximum range where a scaling behaviour of the monomer density around a single star center holds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a statistical definition of @xmath3 , however , is missing . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the radius of gyration @xmath60 has a clear definition as a canonical average , which can be calculated directly in simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore use @xmath60 , which was calculated in the single star simulations , as basic length scale for our simulation data and fit these data for @xmath61 ( @xmath59 ) to the theoretical prediction for @xmath11 using the least - square method and treating @xmath3 as the single fit parameter . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards we check how the optimal value for @xmath3 scales with @xmath60 as obtained from the single star simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is consistent if the ratio @xmath62 is independent of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second difficulty is resolved as follows : a logarithmic potential for @xmath63 implies that the data should fall on a straight line crossing the origin if one plots the _ inverse force _ , @xmath64 , versus @xmath6 inside the corona diameter . </S>",
    "<S> a typical plot is given in figure [ invforce.plot ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the data fall on a straight line . extrapolating the data , however , one does not hit the origin . </S>",
    "<S> the divergence of the force occurs already at a finite distance @xmath65 which clearly has to be attributed to the presence of the finite core in the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we note that both , @xmath35 and @xmath66 , are microscopic length scales and of same order of magnitude ( see table [ parameters.table ] ) , thus being not relevant for the macroscopic length @xmath3 in the scaling regime . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore normalize our distances by subtracting @xmath67 , thus matching the divergence of the force properly . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the slope of the straight line is in very good agreement with the theoretical prediction , see again figure [ invforce.plot ] . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the theoretical prefactor @xmath68 in eq [ potential ] is confirmed by the computer simulations . in figure [ results.plot1 ] , we show the effective force versus distance for five different arm numbers @xmath0 and two monomer numbers @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with the theory is convincing for all @xmath0 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the consistency of our fitting procedure of the corona diameter @xmath3 is documented in table [ parameters.table ] , where the ratio @xmath69 is given for different @xmath0 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath70 independent of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this value also coincides with the value used in ref to fit experimental data for @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> we further note that @xmath71 is independent of @xmath16 , consistent with scaling theory . finally , we prove the exponential decay of the force for distances larger than @xmath3 by plotting the logarithm of the force versus distance in figure [ lnforce.plot ] for one typical example . </S>",
    "<S> one clearly sees the crossover of the inner - core data to a straight line outside the core . </S>",
    "<S> the slope is consistent with the theoretical one as determined by the outermost blob size .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have verified the ultra - soft pair interaction for star polymers by direct molecular simulations . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to generalize the method to two stars confined in a periodically - repeated cubic cell in order to estimate the shrinking of the corona diameter due to a finite star density . also , </S>",
    "<S> similar to charged colloids @xcite , triplets of stars should be considered to investigate the importance of triplet interactions . </S>",
    "<S> our future work lies along these directions .     </S>",
