    "solar flares are associated with magnetic loops or arcades , where accelerated particles move along the field , and can be trapped due to magnetic mirroring or precipitate into the chromosphere , where they produce hard x - rays by bremsstrahlung .",
    "the radio / microwave flare emission is produced by electrons moving in the magnetic field due to the gyrosynchrotron mechanism .",
    "it has been widely demonstrated that the characteristics of this radiation ( spectrum , polarization , spatial distribution ) are strongly dependent on the magnetic field strength and geometry , as well as the properties of the non - thermal electrons , such as energy , pitch - angle and spatial distributions .",
    "high spatial resolution flare observations in microwaves with the nobeyama radio heliograph ( norh ) , very large array ( vla ) and owen valley solar array ( ovsa ) and in x - rays with yohkoh and reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager ( rhessi ) have shown a great variety of source morphologies , interpreted as magnetic arcades , interaction between two or more loops , and many others .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that many flares can be associated with a single magnetic loop , i.e. conjugated footpoints connected by a coronal loop ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of knowledge on the coronal magnetic field usually leads to simple homogenous source model to analyze the emission , although simple field geometries were proposed to model the observed microwave emission of specific flares @xcite . to describe a spatially varying flare source",
    ", it is necessary to define the strength and geometry of the magnetic field , spatial distribution of the non - thermal electrons , and to a lesser importance for microwave emission , the thermal plasma density and temperature , which can be relevant to the free - free absorption and razin effect . to improve our actual knowledge from the flare homogeneous modeling we constructed a database of models using a three dimensional dipolar loop geometry and searched for the ranges of parameters to describe the observables .",
    "the implementation of a dipolar loop geometry is a great improvement from the homogeneous flare model in terms of the description of the flare source .",
    "the motivation of our work was the construction of a models database to be a framework for a joint analyzes of microwave solar flares .",
    "we searched for the set of geometrical conditions to a magnetic bottle that reproduce the statistical properties of the spectra observed by the nobeyama radio polarimeter ( norp ) @xcite and the brightness distribution maps observed by the nobeyama radioheliograph ( norh ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of the work was not to construct a new interactive tool for flare analysis , but to present an ensemble of models with emission characteristics similar of those observed flares to infer physical    parameters of flare loops from this set and evaluate the risk of getting misleading results .",
    "our approach can be considered as a first order approximation of the realistic distribution of parameters . considering actual understanding of flare emission in microwaves about emission mechanisms , geometry , particle distribution in energy and space and the flare ambient ( density and magnetic field )",
    ", we constructed the template of our model , in a similar fashion to other interesting works of @xcite , @xcite and references therein . to analyze the flare properties of our database we calculated more than 5,000 models with a range of parameters capable to reproduce the observed flare characteristics , such as flux densities , spectrum characteristics and source sizes .",
    "figure [ fig : butter]a shows norh flare s heliographic coordinates for 600 observed events in all possible latitudes as known from the butterfly diagram of the active regions .",

    "we used the central angle as the position coordinate of the flare .",
    "the central angle is defined as the angle between the normal of flare position and the normal to the disk center .",
    "this defines 0and 90as the disk centre and solar limb , respectively .",
    "although we see flares near the visual equator the center to limb distribution of flares is not homogeneous .",
    "around 80there is an abrupt decrease in the number of flares , most likely due to imprecision in measuring the position close to the limb or to auto eclipse . center angles smaller than 20show a smaller number of flares , i.  e. , at disk center there is a deficit of events .",
    "this result is a strong motivation for this work , as position and geometry of flaring loops may explain these results .",
    "there is a strong dependence of the gyrosynchrotron emission with the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "if most of the emission comes from the footpoints and legs of the magnetic bottle , at the disk center the angle of the magnetic field , @xmath0 , tends to zero and the emission becomes negligible , resulting in the observed effect of missing flares .",
    "the canonical geometry for a solar flare is a magnetic bottle where the accelerated particles are trapped by magnetic mirroring and emit microwave radiation .",
    "the geometry in the numerical model was based on an analytic dipole magnetic loop , which can be placed in any position observed by norh .",

    "the non - thermal electron density was filled with distance from the top of the structure and considering the total length of the line .      to define the flaring loop magnetic field we used a dipole magnetic field described by : @xmath1 where the dipole is in the origin of coordinates , the @xmath2 is the position vector of any voxel in space and @xmath3 is the dipole magnetic moment with absolute value calculated from the model condition of a given maximum magnetic field at the loop footpoint ( see figure [ fig : dipole ] ) . the figure [ fig : dipole ] shows a magnetic dipole with a moment @xmath4 paralell to the tangent of the solar surface .",

    "several processes such as coulomb collisions , wave - particle interactions , return currents , magnetic trapping can influence the transport of electrons , and this still is subject of intense investigation . however , a detailed description of such transport processes to evaluate the spatial distribution of electrons is out of the scope of our analysis ; moreover , the computing time of these solutions is known to be in a non practical scale for a big number of calculations . to restrict the computing time ,",
    "we defined empirical functions for the electron distributions in energy and space .    for the energy distribution , we adopted a single power law distribution ( with power index @xmath15 as a free parameter ) , in the energy range from 10 kev to 100 mev , in a isotropic pitch - angle distribution . to define the spatial distribution of the electrons @xmath16 we used an empirical weighting function parametrized by a constant @xmath17 as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the normalized ( unit size for all field lines ) distance along the field line from the loop apex and",
