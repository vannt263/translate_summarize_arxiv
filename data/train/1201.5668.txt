    "unification at @xmath10 ( @xmath11 gev ) of @xmath0 yukawa couplings@xcite is largely inspired by the simplest supersymmetric ( susy ) @xmath12 or @xmath13 models@xcite .",
    "it has become clear in recent years@xcite that imposing @xmath0 yukawa coupling unification has important consequences for the sparticle and higgs mass spectrum of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the successful launch of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) has provided important new impetus for these studies@xcite . for analogous discussion of @xmath14 unification ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the parameter space of @xmath12 susy gut models for this investigation is given by m_16 ,  m^2_h_u ,  m^2_h_d ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  sign ( ) , where @xmath15 is the unified matter scalar mass , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the gut scale higgs soft masses , @xmath18 is the unified gaugino mass , @xmath19 is the coefficient of the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) trilinear term , and @xmath20 is the ratio of higgs field vevs . in order to allow for an appropriate radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry , the two gut scale higgs doublet masses must be split@xcite according to @xmath21 . this splitting might arise due to @xmath12 @xmath22-terms ( d - term splitting ) or via gut - scale threshold corrections@xcite ( the higgs splitting , or @xmath23 model ) . with the mssm superpotential parameter @xmath1 , this scenario predicts an inverted scalar mass hierarchy ( imh)@xcite in the squark sector , wherein third generation squarks have masses in the few tev range , while the first two generations of squarks have mass in the 5 - 30 tev range@xcite .",
    "the imh allows one to reconcile a decoupling solution to the susy flavor and @xmath24 problems with relatively low fine - tuning in the ewsb sector .",
    "a successful implementation of the imh scheme requires gut - scale ssb terms to be related as @xmath25 , with unified third generation yukawa couplings and the unified gaugino mass @xmath18 on the low side : typically sub - tev .",
    "one particularly important prediction concerns the gluino which turns out to be the lightest colored susy particle . so that the neutralino lmp in this scenario is not a viable dark matter candidate . to overcome this drawback ,",
    "one proposal@xcite is to invoke axion physics and arrange for the lightest neutralino to decay before nucleosynthesis into an axino , which now plays the role of lightest susy particle ( lsp ) . a combination of axions and axinos",
    "could then make up the dark matter content of the universe . ] since @xmath18 is favored to be small in comparison to @xmath15 , there is some tendency in @xmath0 unified models for @xmath26 gev , which should be within range of susy searches at lhc operating with @xmath27 tev ( lhc7)@xcite . in this case , due to the large @xmath7-quark yukawa coupling and the inverted squark mass spectrum ,",
    "gluinos are expected to dominantly decay by 3-body modes such as @xmath28 , leading to final states at lhc consisting of multiple @xmath7-jets @xmath29@xcite .",
    "in fact , recent searches by the atlas experiment with less than 1 fb@xmath30 of data already exclude @xmath26 gev by searching for multijet plus missing @xmath9 ( met ) plus one or more tagged @xmath7-jets@xcite .",
    "also , direct searches for gluinos and squarks under the assumption of unified gaugino masses by atlas and cms ( again with @xmath31 fb@xmath30 of data ) typically exclude @xmath32 gev ( depending on search techniques)@xcite .",
    "based on this critical input from experiment , the question arises : are @xmath0 unified models now excluded by lhc searches , or can yukawa - unified solution be found with heavier gluinos with mass beyond current lhc reach ? and if such solutions are found , what is the nature of the susy signal which is expected in near future runs of lhc7 ?",
    "our main goal in this paper is to determine whether yukawa - unified solutions with a heavier gluino can exist .",
    "in fact , we find numerous solutions , some of which are presented as a new set of benchmark points with @xmath3 in the range @xmath33 tev . in these solutions",
    ", the gluino retains its position as the lightest colored susy particle , while squarks remain in the multi - tev range .",
    "thus , we expect in this class of models that lhc searches should focus on gluino pair production .",
    "however , for these heavier gluino solutions , the @xmath34 is expected to decay via @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "after @xmath37 and @xmath38 decays , we expect gluino pair production final states to contain typically four @xmath7-jets , four @xmath8 bosons plus met .",
    "these are in rather sharp contrast with models containing @xmath26 gev , where multi-@xmath7-jets@xmath29 final states are expected , but without the numerous on - shell @xmath8 bosons .",
    "note that due to potential threshold corrections which could arise from a variety of sources including a more complicated higgs sector , higher order interaction terms , etc .",
    ", we do not insist on exact ( or perfect ) unification of the three yukawa couplings .",
    "instead , in this paper yukawa unification realized at the 10% level ( or better ) is considered to yield an acceptable scenario . in practice ,",
    "we find solutions with heavy ( @xmath39 tev ) gluino masses that are associated with yukawa unification at a few percent level . somewhat lighter gluino masses (   1 - 1.5 tev ) are accompanied by essentially perfect yukawa unification !",
    "as expected , the squark masses display an inverted mass hierarchy , with the lightest ( third family ) squark masses ranging between 1 to 10 tev .",
    "the first two family squarks turn out to be considerably heavier , of order 8 - 28 tev . in",
    "the benchmark points that we highlight in this paper , the mass of the sm - like higgs boson is of order 124 - 126 gev , a value which is consistent with results from recent atlas and cms higgs searches@xcite .",
    "we employ the isajet  7.80  @xcite package isasugra@xcite to perform random scans over the fundamental parameter space . in this package , the weak scale values of gauge and third generation yukawa couplings",
    "are evolved to @xmath40 via the mssm renormalization group equations ( rges ) in the @xmath41 regularization scheme .",
    "we do not strictly enforce the unification condition @xmath42 at @xmath40 , since a few percent deviation from unification can be assigned to unknown gut - scale threshold corrections  @xcite . the deviation between @xmath43 and @xmath44 at @xmath45",
    "is no worse than @xmath46 . for simplicity we do not include the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling in the rges ,",
    "whose contribution is usually small@xcite .",
    "the various hs model boundary conditions are imposed at @xmath40 and all the ssb parameters , along with the gauge and yukawa couplings , are evolved back to the weak scale @xmath47 . in the evaluation of yukawa couplings ,",
    "the susy threshold corrections  @xcite are taken into account at the common scale @xmath48 .",
    "the entire parameter set is iteratively run between @xmath47 and @xmath40 using the full 2-loop rges until a stable solution is obtained .",
    "to better account for leading - log corrections , one - loop step - beta functions are adopted for gauge and yukawa couplings , and the ssb parameters @xmath49 are extracted from rges at multiple scales @xmath50 .",
    "the rge - improved 1-loop effective potential is minimized at @xmath51 , which effectively accounts for the leading 2-loop corrections .",
    "full 1-loop radiative corrections are incorporated for all sparticle masses .",
    "the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb ) imposes an important theoretical constraint on the parameter space . in order to reconcile rewsb with yukawa unification ,",
    "the mssm higgs soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) masses should be split in such way that @xmath52 at @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the mssm doublets reside in the 10 dimensional representation of @xmath12 gut for yukawa unification condition to hold . in the gravity",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking scenario@xcite , the required splitting in the higgs sector can be generated by involving additional higgs fields@xcite , or via d - term contributions@xcite . in our yukawa - unified susy",
    "spectrum calculations , the lightest neutralino is always turns out to be the lmp .",
    "we have performed markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) scans for the following parameter range : @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "note that our results are not too sensitive to one or two sigma variation in the value of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath57 gev which is hard - coded into isajet .    in scanning the parameter space",
    ", we employ the metropolis - hastings algorithm as described in @xcite .",
    "the data points collected all satisfy the requirement of rewsb , with the neutralino in each case being the lmp . after collecting the data , we impose the mass bounds on all the particles@xcite and use the isatools package  @xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite to implement the various phenomenological constraints .",
    "we successively apply the following experimental constraints on the data that we acquire from isasugra :    [ cols=\">,<,^ \" , ]     in addition , @xmath58 production can occur at large rates for the yukawa - unified bm points@xcite . for all cases listed , @xmath59 at @xmath60 branching fraction , and @xmath61 with typically a branching fraction @xmath62 .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out@xcite that the process @xmath63 should be visible at lhc with @xmath64 tev and @xmath65 fb@xmath30 of integrated luminosity .",
    "this latter gaugino pair production signal offers a second corroborative channel for claiming a susy discovery in models with lighter gauginos and decoupled squarks and sleptons .",
    "in addition , in the @xmath66 channel , the @xmath67 distribution may allow a chargino / neutralino mass extraction provided a very large data sample is acquired .",
    "likewise , for @xmath68 gev , then @xmath69 . in this case , @xmath58 production will yield @xmath70 events , for which the @xmath71 and possibly @xmath72 signatures may be visible at lhc7@xcite .    for point 2 in table  [",
    "tab : bm ] , we show a case with essentially perfect yukawa unification , @xmath73 , but with @xmath74 gev . in this case , the combined branching fraction for gluinos into top quark final states has increased to @xmath75 . with such a heavy gluino , this case would likely be beyond the reach of lhc7@xcite . however , it should be within reach of lhc with @xmath64 tev ( lhc14 ) , which should start operating around 2015 .",
    "benchmark point 3 in table  [ tab : bm ] shows a case with @xmath76 gev and decoupled scalars .",
    "this case , with such a heavy gluino mass , lies right around the ultimate reach of lhc14 with 100 fb@xmath30 , in a search for gluino pair production .",
    "however , the @xmath66 search channel from @xmath58 production may be competitive with gluino pair searches in this case assuming 100 - 1000 fb@xmath30 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the last point 4 in table  [ tab : bm ] corresponds to @xmath77 , but with @xmath78 gev and decoupled scalars .",
    "this is the case with the largest gluino mass we were able to find while requiring @xmath79 and @xmath80 gev .",
    "this case would likely lie beyond reach of lhc14 for any luminosity upgrade .",
    "detection of a susy signal in this case would likely require a @xmath81 collider with @xmath82 tev .",
    "previous papers examining @xmath0 yukawa - unified models with gaugino mass unification and @xmath1 have focused on solutions with rather light gluinos : @xmath83 tev .",
    "these models are now likely all excluded by recent or soon - to - be - released lhc susy searches . in light of these earlier results",
    ", we were motivated to examine if yukawa - unified solutions with heavier gluinos could exist , while also requiring @xmath80 gev , as is recently hinted at by atlas and cms .",
    "using dedicated mcmc scans over @xmath12 parameter space , we have found solutions with excellent yukawa unification and @xmath3 ranging up to 1.4 tev , well beyond current lhc search limits . loosening the yukawa - unification criteria to @xmath79 , we even find solutions with @xmath3 nearly 3 tev .",
    "we have listed four @xmath12 benchmark points with @xmath3 spanning the range @xmath84 tev . regarding lhc susy searches , we note that these heavier gluino solutions will be characterized by gluino pair production at lhc , followed by decays to final states including four @xmath7-jets , four on - shell @xmath8 bosons @xmath29 .",
    "the gluino pair events should be rich in multiple isolated leptons plus @xmath7-jets , and the dominant sm background will likely arise from four top production .",
