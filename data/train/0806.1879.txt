    "it is known , that skew diagrams which give rise to the same skew character have to have the same parts and heights in the same quantity .",
    "this follows from the fact , that the lr tableau of the skew diagram @xmath50 obtained by filling every column with the entries @xmath10 to the height of the column ( e.g.@xmath100 ) has as content @xmath41 the lexicographic biggest partition whose corresponding character @xmath101 $ ] appears in the decomposition of @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "clearly this is the partition obtained by reordering the heights of @xmath50 to form a partition .",
