    "in the coming decades , it is very likely that gravitational waves will be observed by direct - detection experiments .",
    "these include the presently operating ligo and virgo observatories , and proposed experiments such as lisa @xcite , bbo @xcite and decigo @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the first sources to be detected will be localized , transient events , but many cosmological processes yield a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "these backgrounds are a key target for the nascent field of gravitational astronomy , since they probe the primordial universe in ways that are presently impossible .",
    "the most widely discussed cosmological signal is the inflationary gravitational wave background , generated by quantum fluctuations of spacetime .",
    "the amplitude of this signal decreases with the inflationary energy scale , rendering it effectively invisible in models where inflation occurs well below the gut scale .",
    "a stochastic background of gravitational waves can also be generated whenever the universe undergoes a phase transition .",
    "unlike the inflationary background , which is scale invariant , these backgrounds will be peaked at a wavelength correlated with the characteristic scale of the transition . in these scenarios",
    ", the gravitational waves are sourced by the non - zero quadrupole ( and higher ) moments of the matter distribution @xcite .    recently",
    ", several groups have investigated the possibility that gravitational waves are produced during the preheating phase at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "the momentum modes of fields coupled to the inflaton undergo resonant pumping , which renders the universe highly inhomogeneous , and sources the emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "intriguingly , this signal is _ easier _ to detect in models where the inflationary scale is substantially below the gut scale , as first argued in @xcite , and confirmed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , it probes the mechanism that _ ends _ inflation , which is normally assumed to be inaccessible to direct observational tests .",
    "in addition , a second ( and not entirely unrelated ) mechanism could generate a significant background  namely the collision of percolating bubbles formed during a first order phase transition @xcite .",
    "as we will see , it has the same scaling properties as the preheating signal  namely the amplitude need not depend on the energy scale , but its ( present - day ) wavelength decreases linearly with this scale . assuming an energy scale somewhere between the electroweak and gut scales , the hubble scale will lie between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will see that if the characteristic bubble radius is within a few orders of magnitude of the hubble scale at which they form , the resulting gravitational wave background will have a present - day frequency in the range @xmath2 to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "to predict the primordial background , one must know the transfer function , which is determined by the effective equation of state of the universe between the epoch when the signal is generated and the present day .",
    "a further complication is that there is no guarantee that inflation happens only once in the early universe .",
    "one may imagine primary and secondary periods of inflation  where the primary period is responsible for solving the usual cosmological initial conditions problems and laying down the perturbations that seed large scale structure , and the secondary period lasts for @xmath4 @xmath5-foldings , and occurs at some energy scale below that of the first inflationary period and above ( or at ) the scale at which baryogenesis takes place .",
    "if significantly more than @xmath6 @xmath5-folds occurs in the secondary phase , it will erase all relics of the previous phase , returning us to what is effectively a single phase model .",
    "in addition to modifying the mapping between scales in the present epoch and the moment these ( comoving ) scales leave the horizon during the primary phase , a secondary phase of inflation also erases the primordial inflationary background of gravitational waves at wavelengths which have reentered the horizon before the secondary phase begins .",
    "this leads to a situation where a high scale primary phase would generate a gravitational wave background visible in the b - mode of the cmb polarization , but completely _ invisible _ to direct detection experiments operating at solar system scales , such as bbo .",
    "a cosmological model with multiple inflationary phases may appear baroque . however _ thermal inflation _",
    "@xcite is a secondary period of inflation that arises in supersymmetric theories when some ( almost ) flat direction with negative mass - squared at the origin  which we will call the flaton  acquires a thermal contribution to its effective potential , giving it a positive effective mass .",
    "the flaton is thus pinned at the origin , and the finite potential energy at this point drives a secondary period of inflation . once thermal inflation sets in , the temperature falls rapidly and when it drops below the flaton s mass scale ( usually assumed to be a typical soft supersymmetry breaking mass scale @xmath7 ) the flaton rolls aways from the origin , and thermal inflation naturally shuts off .",
    "the total amount of inflation is typically small , about 10 @xmath5-folds or less .",
    "thermal inflation requires only a flat direction with negative mass - squared at the origin , both of which are natural in supersymmetric models . from the model building perspective",
    ", its importance lies in its ability to dilute the moduli and gravitinos , which are generically produced after the primary period of inflation in supersymmetric theories .",
    "these particles either decay , wrecking the successful predictions of big bang nucleosynthesis , or provide a dark matter density that massively overcloses the present universe @xcite .",
    "these particles are produced before thermal inflation begins and are too weakly coupled to be produced after it ends , so their contribution is thus diluted to safe levels .",
    "thermal inflation is perhaps the best - motivated solution to the moduli problem , which is endemic to supersymmetric models of the early universe , including many of those derived from string theory .",
    "thermal inflation has a relatively low reheating scale ( typically @xmath8 ) but it can give rise to baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as we will show in section  [ sect : forecasts ] , thermal inflation wipes out any primordial inflationary gravitational wave signal in the range of frequencies accessible to bbo .",
    "thus , even if the primary phase of inflation occurs at a high enough scale to produce a detectable tensor background , thermal inflation erases it at short scales @xcite .",
    "if this was the end of the story , one might regard it as an unfortunate side - effect of solving the moduli problem , but there is a final piece to the puzzle : thermal inflation ends via bubble nucleation , and the collisions between these bubbles as they percolate produces a significant stochastic gravitational wave background .",
    "we will see that this process may generate @xmath9 , and is potentially detectable by bbo .",
    "thermal inflation is a complicated scenario , at least when compared to simple toy models of inflation .",
    "however , it relies on generic ingredients found in many supersymmetric or stringy models of the early universe ; it is the intrinsic richness of these models that generates their complicated phenomenology . in particular ,",
    "the moduli problem is robust enough to have survived 25 years .",
    "conversely , thermal inflation does not require any exotic physics , unnatural parameter values or initial conditions , and the complexity of this scenario may in fact be typical of realistic models of the early universe . finally ,",
    "while the primordial gravitational background is erased , it would need to have been near the top of its plausible range to have been observable even without dilution , and furthermore in supersymmetric and stringy models the bottom of this range is arguably more natural @xcite .",
    "the bubble collision signature is generic to thermal inflation and effectively expands the list of the models probed by bbo .",
    "in section 2 we summarize thermal inflation , and describe the process of bubble nucleation that occurs as it ends . in section 3",
    "we describe the production of gravitational waves by bubble collisions and estimate the expected spectrum . in section 4",
    "we compute the suppression to the primordial inflationary background by a secondary period of inflation , combine this with the likely spectrum from bubble collisions , and assess the prospects for detecting this signal in future observatories , the likelihood it can be distinguished from other stochastic astrophysical backgrounds , and the likely tensor signal from the primary inflationary phase , which would be undiluted at cmb scales , or via pulsar timing experiments @xcite .",
    "finally we sum up in section 5 .",
    "the main motivation for thermal inflation @xcite is to solve the moduli problem @xcite , though it also solves the gravitino problem @xcite and provides a mechanism for baryogenesis @xcite .",
    "irrespective of these uses , thermal inflation is sufficiently natural that it might occur anyway .",
    "moduli are scalar fields with planckian vacuum expectation values , and hence gravitational strength interactions . their potential arises due to supersymmetry breaking , and assuming supersymmetry breaking is transmitted to the observable sector via gravitational strength interactions , moduli have vacuum masses of order the soft supersymmetry breaking scale in the observable sector @xmath10 however , in the early universe , the finite energy density breaks supersymmetry .",
    "when @xmath11 this supersymmetry breaking dominates over the vacuum supersymmetry breaking and hence determines the moduli potential .",
    "when @xmath12 drops below @xmath13 the moduli potential reduces to its vacuum form , but with the moduli typically displaced by a planckian distance .",
    "the moduli then start oscillating with planckian amplitude and immediately dominate the energy density of the universe .",
    "thanks to the relatively low moduli mass and their very weak interactions , these oscillations persist beyond nucleosynthesis with disasterous consequences @xcite .",
    "inflation is typically invoked to rid the universe of unwanted relics , but one would expect an inflaton to have a mass @xmath14 and so primordial inflation to occur at scales @xmath11 .",
    "the moduli are generated at @xmath15 , and to a lesser extent by any phase transition at @xmath16 .",
    "thus one wants inflation at @xmath17 to dilute the moduli , but it is very difficult to realize primordial inflation at these scales . on the other hand ,",
    "thermal inflation @xcite automatically occurs at @xmath17 . for a thermal inflation scale",
    "@xmath18 thermal inflation provides enough dilution to rid the universe of moduli , but has a low enough scale not to regenerate them afterwards .",
    "furthermore , as thermal inflation lasts about 10 @xmath5-folds or less , it does not destroy the primordial perturbations needed for structure formation . while thermal inflation provides a very natural solution to the moduli problem",
    ", it is incompatible with most baryogenesis scenarios since it will dilute baryons produced before it begins , and the reheat temperature after thermal inflation is very low ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "fortunately , a baryon asymmetry is almost automatically generated at the end of thermal inflation @xcite , solving this difficulty .",
    "like the standard model higgs field , the flaton has a negative mass - squared at the origin @xmath20 with @xmath21 , the soft supersymmetry breaking mass scale .",
    "unlike the standard model higgs field , but like many scalar field directions in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , and @xmath22 were not satisfied , then the mssm would have a flaton . ] the flaton does not have a stabilizing @xmath23 term .",
    "instead , non - renormalizable higher order terms stabilize its potential at a large field value @xmath24 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : potential ] .",

    "the amplitude and shape they obtain for the resulting spectrum is broadly similar to the numerical results of @xcite ( note that @xcite assumes there is no matter - dominated phase after percolation ) , adding support to our estimate .",

    "if a cmb b - mode is sourced by a primordial spectrum of gravitational waves , the properties of this signal do not depend strongly on the details post - inflationary physics , since the relevant modes are outside the horizon until after matter - radiation equality .",
    "conversely , direct detection experiments are sensitive to modes with much smaller wavelengths , and their current amplitude can depend strongly on the expansion history of the post - inflationary universe @xcite . in particular , since gravitational waves scale like radiation with @xmath126 , any phase in which the universe is dominated by a component whose density scales away less rapidly than radiation will suppress the gravitational background on sub - horizon scales , as first discussed by @xcite .",
    "looking at the cosmological history implied by thermal inflation , we find three distinct epochs during which the _ short wavelength _ primordial gravitational wave background can be diluted : moduli matter domination , thermal inflation itself , and flaton domination after thermal inflation .",

    "all modes reenter the horizon after the primary phase of inflation , with an amplitude determined by standard inflationary perturbation theory @xcite , @xmath128 . during moduli matter domination a mode inside the horizon will be diluted by a factor of @xmath129 .",
    "as soon as thermal inflation kicks in the suppression factor is @xmath130 , dropping back to zero if the mode re - exits the horizon and re - freezes .",
    "modes inside the horizon are further diluted by a factor of @xmath129 during the flaton dominated phase , but this extra suppression is largely academic , other than for modes which are sourced by the bubble collisions . a schematic plot of the final spectrum is given in figure  [ fig : thermalplot ] .",
    "note that the primordial gravitational wave spectrum is unsuppressed on long scales , so the constraint on the inflationary scale implied by the upper bound on the cmb b - mode is still valid @xcite .    for a fixed value of @xmath131 , gravitational waves are easier to detect at long wavelengths , as the required strain - sensitivity scales as @xmath132 @xcite . via eq .",
    "( [ eqn : peakfreq ] ) , we see that the peak frequency scales as @xmath133 , and a lower thermal inflation scale leads to a redder peak , and thus a more detectable signal .",

    "( [ eqn : energydensity ] ) , increases the present day amplitude by a factor @xmath135 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath136 is increased , the amplitude is boosted by a factor of @xmath137 , while the peak frequency grows as @xmath138 .",
    "thus , _ low scale _",
    "thermal inflation with a short period of flaton matter domination is the optimal prescription for generating an observable spectrum of gravitational waves during the bubble nucleation phase . in terms of the thermal inflation parameter",
    "space , this situation is equivalent to having a small value of @xmath28 .    for generic parameter values ,",
    "this signal will peak at around frequencies of @xmath139 , as shown in figure  [ fig : thermalplot ] .",
    "this corresponds to a wavelength on the order of @xmath140 , which is characteristic of bbo or decigo style space - based proposals @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strong spectral dependence of the bubble collision signal will differentiate it from that the featureless primordial spectrum .",
    "this analysis draws on a number of apparently disparate topics in theoretical cosmology .",
    "firstly , it looks carefully at thermal inflation , considering both its expansion history and the properties of the bubbles created by the phase transition that marks its end .",
    "historically , the primary motivation for considering thermal inflation is that it provides a natural solution to the moduli problem , which is endemic to supersymmetric models and arises from the production of a condensate of long - lived moduli particles which either disrupt nucleosynthesis as they decay or massively overclose the universe .",
    "thermal inflation dilutes these unwanted particles to acceptable levels .",
    "however , we show that thermal inflation also dilutes the _ primordial _ gravitational wave background at small scales , rendering it effectively unobservable by direct detection experiments such as bbo , but preserving any signal that is present in the cmb b - mode .",
    "the detailed dependence of the bbo signal on the effective equation of state in the primordial universe has been discussed elsewhere ( e.g.   @xcite ) but the dilution factor implied by thermal inflation would effectively erase any primordial signal .    conversely , thermal inflation ends via a first order phase transition , so the percolation of the resulting bubbles can generate a new background of gravitational waves .",
    "this spectrum is confined to a few decades in frequency  unlike the scale - free inflationary background  and is potentially detectable by bbo style experiments . while the detailed mechanism is different , this signal has much in common with the gravitational wave background that can be generated during preheating or parametric resonance @xcite .",
    "further study will be needed to see if the characteristic spectra can be easily distinguished from one another .",
    "the analysis here only considers the background generated by the bubble collisions themselves  a period of turbulent mixing after the bubble collisions would also source gravitational waves , and this signal has not yet been computed .",
    "it has the potential to significantly enhance the gravitational wave signal , since the bubble nucleation phase is followed by a period of flaton domination , mimicking a matter dominated universe , and diluting the background produced by colliding bubbles . if the turbulence lasts well into effective matter dominated phase , any gravitational waves sourced via the turbulent mixing will be less strongly diluted . consequently , the spectrum computed here represents a lower bound on the total signal .",
    "further , the background will be strongly inhomogenous on small scales due to the bubble collisions and other preheating mechanisms .",
    "it is unclear exactly how efficient this preheating is and so how much it changes the effective equation of state , hence the last factor in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : energydensity ] ) which may be significant .",
    "thus , the suppression factor could again be reduced , leading to a stronger gravitational wave signal in the present epoch .",
