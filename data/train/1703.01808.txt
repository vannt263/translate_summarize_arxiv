    "one of important problems in radiative transfer theory is the milne problem .",
    "this problem is related with the solution of the transfer equation when the sources of non - polarized radiation are located far from the boundary of optically thick atmosphere .",
    "the most known example is the milne problem in free electron non - absorbed atmosphere .",
    "this problem was solved by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) .",
    "his results for the angular distribution @xmath5 and polarization degree @xmath6 of the emerging radiation are used in many applications .",
    "recall , that @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the angle between line of sight @xmath9 and the outer normal @xmath10 to the plane - parallel optically thick atmosphere .",
    "the angular distribution @xmath11 increases with the increase of @xmath12 up to value @xmath13 .",
    "the polarization degree is @xmath14 and inreases up to @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "the small dust grains with the spherical form and the molecules with isotropic polarizability @xmath17 scatter the radiation by the same law as the electrons .",
    "if the absorption factor of the dust substance @xmath1 increases , the angular distribution and polarization degree also increase .",
    "for example , in the case @xmath18 one takes place @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( see silantev 1980 ) .",
    "the dust grains and molecules are characterized by the anisotropic polarizability tensor @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the cyclic frequency of light .",
    "these scattering particles due to chaotic thermal motions are freely oriented in an atmosphere .",
    "the radiative transfer equation for this case firstly was derived by chandrasekhar ( 1960 ) .",
    "this equation depends on two parameters - @xmath23 , describing the rayleigh scattering , and the additional term @xmath24 , which describes the effect of anisotropy of scattering particles .",
    "this term ( depolarization factor ) describes the an additional isotropic non - polarized part of scattered radiation .",
    "the depolarizing effect of anisotropy of particles mostly reveals by consideration of axially symmetric problems .",
    "one of such problems is the milne problem .    in",
    "axially symmetric problems the radiation is described by two intensities - @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here",
    "@xmath27 is the optical depth below the surface of semi - infinite plane - parallel atmosphere , the intensity @xmath28 describes the light linearly polarized in the plane ( @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 is the light intensity with polarization perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the total intensity @xmath31 , and the stokes parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the stokes parameter @xmath33 .",
    "the degree of linear polarization is characterized by @xmath34 .",
    "note that case @xmath35 corresponds to the wave electric field oscillations perpendicular to the plane @xmath36 .",
    "this case occurs in the milne problem .",
    "the factorization of the matrix phase function @xmath37 , i.e. the presentation this matrix as a product of two matrices @xmath38 , plays very important role in radiative transfer theory .",
    "factorization is not unique ( see hulst 1980 ) .",
    "factorization used in papers lenoble ( 1970 ) , abhyankar & fymat ( 1971 ) and schnatz & siewert ( 1971 ) for matrix phase function , described the rayleigh scattering , is assumed in our consideration .",
    "it should be noted that the factorization used in ivanov ( 1995 ) is enough simple to describe multiple scattering in one component atmospheres . for two component atmosphere , which we consider ,",
    "their factorization is considerably complicated than that used in this paper .",
    "first let us remember the radiative transfer equation for the ( column ) vector with the components ( @xmath39 ) in an atmosphere consisting of averaged small anisotropic particles ( see chandrasekhar 1960 ; dolginov et al .",
    "1995 , silantev et al .",
    "2015 ) :    @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 \\left ( \\begin { array}{c } i_l(\\tau,\\mu ) \\\\",
    "i_r(\\tau,\\mu ) \\end{array}\\right ) -\\frac{1}{2}s(z)\\left ( \\begin { array}{c } 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array } \\right ) , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where extinction factor @xmath43 , @xmath44 determines the dimensionless optical depth , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the cross - sections of scattering and absorption by dust grains , @xmath47 is cross - section of total extinction , @xmath48 is the number density of scattering grains ; @xmath49 is cosine of the angle between the directions of light propagation @xmath9 and the outer normal @xmath10 to plane - parallel semi - infinite atmosphere , the value @xmath50 is the source of non - polarized radiation .",
    "usual source of radiation is the thermal radiation : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the planck function with the temperature , depending on the optical depth @xmath53 .",
    "this dependence appears as a result of consideration of various models of atmospheres .",
    "the term with @xmath23 in eq.(1 ) describes the rayleigh scattering by isotropic particle ( see chandrasekhar 1960 ) .",
    "the term with @xmath24 ( the depolarization factor ) describes the isotropic scattering of non - polarized radiation due to anisotropy of a particle .    for reader s convenience ,",
    "we shortly explane the physical sence of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the scattering cross - section of small particles ( dust grains , molecules ) is ( dolginov et al .",
    "1995 ) : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is cyclic frequency of light , @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the speed of light .",
    "the values @xmath58 and @xmath59 are related to polarizability tensor @xmath21 of a particle as a whole .",
    "induced dipole moment of a particle , as a whole , is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "anisotropic particle with axial symmetry is characterized by two polarizabilities - along the symmetry axis @xmath61 , and in transverse direction @xmath62 . for such particles :    @xmath63 @xmath64 in transfer equation we use the dimensionless parameters    @xmath65 @xmath66 for needle like particles ( @xmath67 parameters @xmath68 , and for plate like particles ( @xmath69 ) we have @xmath70 .",
    "parameter @xmath24 describes the depolarization of radiation , scattered by freely oriented anisotropic particles .",
    "the absorption of light is described by imaginary part of the polarizability of freely oriented grain : @xmath71 ( see frlich 1958 , dolginov et al.1995 ) .",
    "the estimate of polarizability @xmath17 may be taken from the formula @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is radius of the dust grain and @xmath74 is refraction index of the dust subject ( @xmath75 ) . if @xmath74 is large , the polarizability @xmath76 .",
    "for the graphite grains greenberg ( 1968 ) gives @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( for wavelength @xmath79 mk . )    now , let us take into account the second component of an atmosphere - the free electrons , which scatter the radiation as isotropic particles , i.e. is described by term analogously to the term with @xmath80 .",
    "first of all the extinction factor acquires the form : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the number density of free electrons .",
    "the value @xmath83 @xmath84 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "it appears that the grain cross - section is much greater than small thomson s one .",
    "the inclusion the electron scattering means that to the factor @xmath85 we are add the expression @xmath86 .",
    "the transition to optical depth @xmath87 gives rise to the expression    @xmath88    in the the electron scattering term , where    @xmath89 .",
    "the dust grains term transforms to @xmath90 . here",
    "@xmath91 is the degree of absorption of radiation in dust grain .",
    "it is easy check that there exists the matrix equality : @xmath92 @xmath93 where matrix @xmath94 has the form :    @xmath95    note that superscript @xmath96 will be used for matrix transpose .",
    "it is useful introduce the vector @xmath97 : @xmath98 from this expression we obtain the relation :    @xmath99    this relation allows us to join the @xmath24-term with the @xmath23-term .    as a result",
    ", we obtain the radiative transfer in gas - dusty medium in the following form :    @xmath100    where the matrix @xmath101 has the form : @xmath102 the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath103 depend on other parameters : @xmath104 @xmath105 the value @xmath106 corresponds to inequality @xmath107 .",
    "it is easy check that from the transfer equation ( 11 ) the conservative law of radiative flux follows .",
    "taking @xmath108 and @xmath109 we obtain :    @xmath110      it should be noted that radiative transfer equation ( 11 ) differs from eq.(9 ) in silantev et al .",
    "eq.(11 ) describes the atmosphere consisting of two components - free electrons and dust grains .",
    "eq.(9 ) in silantev et al . ( 2015 ) describes the one component medium either free electrons or dust grains .",
    "the general theory to calculate the vector @xmath111 , presented in silantev et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , can be easily transformed to the case of eq.(11 ) .",
    "recall , that according to general theory the vector @xmath97 obeys the integral equation , which has solution through the resolvent matrix @xmath112 .",
    "the differences in technique for our eq.(11 ) are that the equation for resolvent matrix @xmath112 has now other kernel @xmath113 , which does not coincide with the transposed one : @xmath114 . for this reason , two @xmath115 and @xmath116 - matrices",
    "arize instead of one in silantev et al.(2015 ) .",
    "these matrices obey the following system of equations :    @xmath117    @xmath118    here the matrix @xmath119 has the form : @xmath120 @xmath121 the linear equation for matrix @xmath115 is the following : @xmath122 @xmath123 where @xmath124 is arbitrary number .",
    "the specific feature of the milne problem is that we are to solve integral equation for @xmath97 without the free term .",
    "therefore the vector @xmath125 , describing the emerging radiation , has the form :    @xmath126 @xmath127 i.e. this expression is proportional to the laplace transform of @xmath97 over variable @xmath128 .",
    "the homogeneous equation for @xmath97 without the source term has the form : @xmath129 where the kernel @xmath130 is the following : @xmath131    further we follow to simple approach to solve the scalar milne problem by sobolev ( 1969 ) , generalizing this method for the vector case . for simplicity",
    "we omit the subscript @xmath132 . according to eqs.(20 ) and",
    "( 21 ) , we derive the value @xmath133 : @xmath134 @xmath135 let us get the equation for derivative @xmath136 , taking into account that the kernel @xmath137 depends on the difference @xmath138 : @xmath139 @xmath140 the general solution of eq.(23 ) contains the solution of homogeneous eq.(20 ) with some constant @xmath141 , i.e. @xmath142 , and the solution of non - homogeneous equation ( 20 ) .",
    "the latter is proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "the remaining factor obeys the equation for @xmath143 , i.e. the general solution of eq.(23 ) has the form :    @xmath144    now let us derive the laplace transform of this equation .",
    "the laplace transform of the left part of this equation is equal to : @xmath145 @xmath146 the laplace transform of the right part of eq.(24 ) has the form : @xmath147 the equality of eq.(25 ) with eq.(26 ) gives rise to the relation : @xmath148 here we used the relation @xmath149 , following from general theory in silantev et al.(2015 ) .",
    "@xmath150 is unit matrix . substituting this formula into eq.(19 )",
    ", we obtain the expression for @xmath125 : @xmath151 further we introduce the new matrices : @xmath152 using these notions , we obtain from eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) the following system for matrices @xmath153 and @xmath154 : @xmath155 @xmath156 the kernels in eqs.(30 ) and ( 31 ) do not depend on @xmath157 , i.e. these equations are simpler than the system ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath125 is proportional to @xmath133 .",
    "according to eq.(22 ) the value @xmath133 related with expression ( 27 ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain the homogeneous equation for @xmath133 : @xmath158 or in new matrix @xmath153 @xmath159    this homogeneous equation allows us to obtain only the ratio @xmath160 .",
    "for this reason , from eq.(28 ) we can get the angular distribution @xmath161 and the degree of polarization @xmath162 .",
    "the unknown const is related with the flux of outgoing radiation .",
    "the negative @xmath6 denotes that the wave electric field oscillations are perpendicular to the plane @xmath163 .",
    "the necessary condition to obtain @xmath133 is the zero of the determinant of expression ( 32 ) . according to eq.(18 )",
    "the zero s determinant of equation ( 32 ) denote that the determinant of left part of eq.(18 ) is to be equal zero .",
    "thus , we obtain the separate equation to derive the characteristic number @xmath124 : @xmath164 this equation is not related with the calculation of the matrix @xmath115 .",
    "it is easy check that the determinant ( 34 ) is equal to zero , if we take @xmath108 and @xmath165 .    for pure absorbing dust grains ( @xmath166 ) the matrix @xmath167 depends only on parameter @xmath0 .",
    "in this case the term , describing the light scattering by dust grains , disappears . nevertheless the parameter @xmath168 in term , describing scattering by free electrons , obtains the sence of effective absorption : @xmath169 , i.e. the effective absorption @xmath170 .",
    "so , the pure absorbing dust grains play the role of effective absorption in the electron scattering .",
    "note that @xmath171 , if the parameter @xmath172 .",
    "the characteristic number @xmath124 increases with the increasing of the degree of absorption @xmath1 .",
    "we see from eq.(28 ) ( see the term @xmath173 ) ) that the increase of @xmath124 gives rise to greater sharpness of the angular distribution of emerging radiation @xmath174 the most high radiation intensity corresponds to @xmath175 .",
    "recall , that the main value of the polarization arizes due to the last scattering of radiation before escape the surface .",
    "it is known that the maximum polarization of single scattered radiation takes place at @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the polarization is high near @xmath176 , when the incident radiation is mostly directed along the normal @xmath10 .",
    "the case of large radiation absorption gives rise to the peak like emerging intensity along the normal @xmath10 .",
    "this produces high degree of polarization at @xmath16 .    in table 1",
    "we present the dependence of characteristic number @xmath124 on the degree of absorption @xmath1 , when the free electrons are absent ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "it is seen that the value @xmath124 practically does not depend on the form of freely oriented dust particles .",
    "nevertheless the small inequalities @xmath178 exist .",
    "more profound inequality occurs for needle like particles . the relative difference ( @xmath179 corresponds to small absorption factor ( @xmath180 . for large absorption factor ( @xmath181 )",
    "the difference between all forms disappear .",
    "our inequalities confirm that , if the parameter @xmath182 is greater , then the characteristic number @xmath124 is greater too .    in table 2",
    "we demonstrate how the presence of the second component , the free non - absorbing electrons , affects the value of characteristic number . physically clear that for @xmath183 the mean effective absorption diminishes , i.e. the value @xmath124 also diminishes .",
    "table 2 and fig.1 demonstrate this feature for all range of parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the large values @xmath0 corresponds to small @xmath124 ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "recall , that fig.1 corresponds to @xmath184 .",
    "clearly , the small characteristic number does not give very sharp angular dependence of the radiation intensity @xmath11 . the case @xmath172 corresponds to the free electron atmosphere .",
    "the value @xmath185 for @xmath165 and spherical polarizability ( @xmath184 ) is equal to @xmath186 ( see chandrasekhar 1960 ) .",
    "this case gives the polarization @xmath187 . in table 3",
    "we present also the milne problem solutions for needle like particls ( @xmath188 ) and plate like grains ( @xmath189 ) also for non - absorbing case @xmath108 .",
    "the needle like particles give @xmath190 and corresponding maximum polarization @xmath191 . for plate like grains we have @xmath192 and @xmath193 .    for @xmath18 and @xmath177",
    "the corresponding results are given in table 4 .",
    "it is seen that the nonzero absorption increases the polarization values for all forms of dust grains .",
    "the case @xmath194 diminishes the polarization degree , as it is seen from table 5 .",
    "we see that the presence of absorption ( @xmath18 ) considerably increases the polarization values @xmath195 , respectively .",
    "the angular dependence also increase , @xmath196 @xmath197 , respectively . for @xmath18 and @xmath198",
    "( see fig.5 ) the results are : @xmath199 ,    @xmath200 and @xmath201 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that anisotropy of grains considerably changes the polarization of emerging radiation but practically does not change the angular distribution @xmath11 as compared with @xmath184 case .",
    "recall , that @xmath202 and the needle like grains has the depolarization parameter @xmath203 , i.e. twice as large compared with plate like grains ( @xmath204 ) .",
    "for this reason polarization from needle like particles is smaller than that from plate like ones .",
    "the limit case of @xmath205 ( pure absorbing dust grains ) for @xmath206 and 10 is presented in table 6 .",
    "note that for @xmath207 the angular distribution @xmath11 and degree of polarization tend to vaflues in table 3 ( two first columns ) .",
    "2 - 5 present the particular values of angular distribution of radiation @xmath11 and polarization degrees @xmath6 in % for parameters @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "it is seen that cases @xmath211 and @xmath212 are close to the angular distribution @xmath11 and polarization degree @xmath6 corresponding to free electron scattering ( see table 3 ) , where @xmath13 and @xmath213 .",
    "it appears , the values @xmath211 and @xmath212 correspond to the case when the scattering due to dust grains is negligible with the electron scattering .    .",
    "the characteristic number @xmath214 for @xmath177 and @xmath215 corresponding to spherical , needle like and plate like particles , respectively [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we consider the milne problem in two component atmosphere - free electrons and small anisotropic grains .",
    "the radiative transfer equation in such atmosphere depends on three parameters .",
    "parameter @xmath0 is the ratio of the thomson optical length to that due to small grains .",
    "the value @xmath23 characterizes radiation scattered in accordance with rayleigh phase matrix and the parameter @xmath24 ( depolarization parameter ) describes the isotropic scattering .",
    "these values obey the relation @xmath216 .",
    "the third parameter @xmath217 is the degree of radiation absorption by dust grains .",
    "we use the matrix resolvent function @xmath218 approach ( see silantev et al . 2015 ) .",
    "this matrix is connected with two auxiliar matrices , depending on one variable - @xmath53 or @xmath219 .",
    "the laplace transform of these matrices @xmath115 and @xmath116 obeys the system nonlinear matrix equations similar to known system of equations for chandrasekhar s scalar @xmath220- functions .",

    "these linear equations was derived in algebraic manner from the system of nonlinear equations for matrices @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
