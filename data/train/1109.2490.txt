    "spectroscopic studies of superconducting qubit systems have increased steadily in sophistication in recent years . for many of the first josephson - junction qubits ,",
    "their only link with the outside world was magnetometry : diamagnetic currents , particularly in flux qubits , were detectable by squid magnetometers . while this provided the basis for some of the first experiments in which solid state qubit states were detected , these magnetometers were very intrusive devices in these systems , and were clearly an impediment to scalable systems .",
    "spectroscopy with these squid detectors was very limited .    with the application in recent years of many sophisticated techniques from microwave engineering , various alternatives to the squid approach have emerged .",
    "the detection , protection , and manipulation of superconducting qubits have undergone impressive improvements .",
    "in particular , the spectroscopic probing of qubits and qubit / resonator systems is now capable of very useful high - fidelity qubit detection@xcite , as well as detailed characterization of the parameters of these systems opening a beautiful view @xcite into the rich quantum response that these systems exhibit .",
    "this paper will provide a theoretical study of a model that is central to these spectroscopic studies .",
    "the model is that of a single oscillator ( bosonic mode ) with a purely quartic anharmonicity .",
    "the oscillator is driven by a single ac tone , which is not necessarily a small perturbation on the system , and the system is damped with a purely frictional term , representative of a zero - temperature quantum environment .",
    "the observable is taken to be essentially the displacement of this resonator .",
    "we will emphasize here the insights that can be gained from analytic or semi - analytic studies of this model .",
    "in previous studies of this model@xcite , it has been shown that the steady state response of the system can be calculated in closed form .",
    "it is very rewarding to look at the many aspects of this amazingly rich solution . at high damping it exhibits much of the phenomenology of the classical duffing oscillator . in a broad region of detuning , on the  red \" side of the harmonic response frequency , and for moderately high amplitude excitation , the response is  high \" , or quasi - resonant .",
    "but as damping is decreased , new , sharp resonant structures emerge from the broad duffing feature .",
    "these lines are clearly associated with individual spectroscopic transitions in the anharmonic ladder of energy eigenstates .",
    "but the line shapes of these new lines are very non - lorentzian , and are indicative of a complex interaction among different response channels . in the present work",
    "we do further calculations to gain more understanding of several of these spectroscopic features . up to a point",
    ", the behavior in the high damping regime exactly matches the classical duffing theory .",
    "there is a linear response regime , in which the response is a simple lorentzian centered on the harmonic frequency of the oscillator ; at higher excitation amplitude the resonant line moves to lower frequency and sharpens .",
    "but there are differences : the quantum model intrinsically does not have multiple solutions for the steady state response , and so does not have any hysteretic behavior .",
    "near the classical bifurcation point the quantum response shows a fairly abrupt transition , as a function of excitation detuning , between a  low \" and  high \" response regime .",
    "while some details of this interesting quantum behavior have been discussed in previous work , we shed new light on this behavior using simple wigner function computations . in the middle of this transition from ",
    "low \" to  high \" response , there is a dip in the response amplitude , which has been interpreted @xcite as a kind of intermittency in the steady state involving two responses with different , and therefore canceling , phases .",
    "our wigner functions show that there is clearly some truth to this point of view , but we find that , even for damping large enough to wash out all other quantum spectral features , the dip has more features than can be explained by any classical intermittency point of view . we find that this story is considerably enriched by using some of the modern tools of quantum information theory , such as calculations of the von - neumann entropy , and some basic facts about the eigenanalysis of the completely positive map describing time evolution in our model",
    ".    we also explore in detail how structure emerges as the damping parameter is decreased .",
    "while the spectral response grows considerably in complexity , we find that the simple  dip \" described above in the high damping regime persists for all values of damping , but comes in a different guise in this quantum limit . in one part of the spectrum , we identify this dip as a feature of a fano resonance .",
    "the fano phenomenon is a quintessentially quantum interference , yet we find that in this case it is one extreme of a family of interference phenomena that also include a nearly classical form of interference at the other extreme .",
    "these studies help us to answer a very fundamental question about anharmonic resonant structures , which is : when is it reasonable to call such a structure a qubit ?",
    "it is evident that the answer is a dynamical one : the very same resonator can be either a very well defined two - level quantum system ( a qubit ) , or an oscillator requiring a many - level quantum description , depending on the amplitude and frequency of oscillation . in this paper",
    "we will fairly precisely demarcate the rather complex boundary between these two regimes .",
    "the calculations here are motivated by current experiments on superconducting circuits such as the one shown in fig . [",
    "fig : fig0 ] . the ac voltage signal ( in the microwave frequency range , in cases of current interest )",
    "excites a transmission line ; this transmission line is coupled capacitively to a small , discrete superconducting circuit that we will , for short , call  the qubit . \" but an important message of this paper is that structures of interest do not always behave as qubits , that is , like two - level quantum mechanical systems . from the point of view of electrical science , the combination shown of a capacitor , inductor , and josephson junction is viewed as an anharmonic resonator . as we will show , depending on the excitation conditions , this classical view is sometimes more appropriate than the quantum mechanical one .",
    "in fact , there is a rich set of phenomena that are explained by neither the classical or the simple ( two - level ) quantum point of view .",
    "many features of a real experiment are omitted from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] . naturally the qubit is held at low temperature , while the microwave voltage source is ( presently ) always at room temperature ; the diagram does not show the attenuator stages that are necessary to keep room temperature noise out of the qubit .",
    "but these stages are engineered so that the functioning is that of a cold , matched ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 ) source . on the output end , conceptually measurements of the qubit are recorded as the voltage across the terminating resistor @xmath1 . in reality , this circuit is a complex , active chain of amplifiers and other components , with a signal recorded at room temperature . but",

    "the linear response has no resonant structure at this detuning , but the @xmath136 part of the response is resonant here .",
    "but the linear response has a uniform far off resonant background at this detuning , and resonance emerges our of this background ( see fig . [ zerdet2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the behavior here is very different in detail from the no - detuning line , although mathematically , they arise from two different poles of the same matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ bigmatrix ] ) .    furthermore , it is easy to show that because of interference of the resonant response with the background , the line that emerges in fig .",
    "[ onedet ] has a fano line shape@xcite @xmath137 with suitably normalized frequency @xmath138 .",
    "the fano parameter @xmath106 is easy to calculate : @xmath139 since we are in a regime where @xmath140 , this fano parameter is close to @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath142 is among the most asymmetrical of the fano line shapes @xcite , in striking contrast to the initial symmetry of the distorted zero - detuning line .",
    "this fano line exhibits a trough on the high - frequency side of the line .",
    "this is the beginning of the trough that forms a scallop from one `` stalactite '' to the next , and so it is the structure that has continuously evolved from the semiclassical trough that occurs at high damping .",
    "it is curious that the classical interference arising from intermittency at high damping evolves continuously into a fano destructive interference , which we think of as entirely quantum mechanical .",
    "we will say much less about the resonant structures that arise at higher detuning , except to make a couple of observations : all higher lines emerge in a similar way to the @xmath94 line , with a fano line shape with the same asymmetry ( so , evidently , a similar @xmath106 , which we have not calculated ) .",
    "each emerges first at successively higher order in the response ; so , the resonant line at @xmath98 arises first at order @xmath143 .",
    "the calculation shows that the first appearance of the line from the background ( as measured by the first appearance of a zero slope near the resonance frequency ) occurs at an excitation level that goes like @xmath144 with some increasing function @xmath145 .",
    "we note that the dominant background is always the off resonant response of the zero - detuning line , rather than the background of any nearer by lines , no matter how large the value of @xmath102 .",
    "so , from eq .",
    "( [ scaler ] ) we see that it is only the @xmath101 and @xmath146 lines that first show nonlinear structure at @xmath147 ; structures at all higher detunings occur only at higher power ( _ e.g. _ , for @xmath148 the onset is at @xmath149 ) .",
    "it is clear that the present study is only a piece of the full picture in the theoretical modeling of the complete input - output relations for the excitation of qubit structures .",
    "the potential complexity of the decohering environment of these structures has barely been touched on here , and remains a frontier area of research . for actual applications , more of the essential further work will be in the time domain rather than the frequency domain ; pulsed excitation of qubits , both for gate operations and for measurements , will definitely be the study of more extensive modeling as this experimental art develops further .",
    "still , the present simple study has revealed an intricate complex of phenomena .",
    "one example of a further study that it possible as a direct follow on to this work is the more detailed examination of the validity and limits of the rotating wave approximation .",
    "the simplicity of the mathematics here should permit a definite if limited answer to questions about this .",
    "these questions often do not have such a clear answer in a more general setting .",
    "another question raised by the present study concerns the emergence of classical bistability .",
    "as we have seen , the quantum theory says that there is a continuum of states ( convex combinations of @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) that are metastable .",
    "which two of them does the classical physics pick out ?",
    "we have offered a conjecture here that the ones of locally minimum von neumann entropy ( which happen to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 themselves ) are the classical states .",
    "their low entropy is associated ( albeit indirectly ) with their high degree of localization of the wigner function in the complex @xmath59 plane .",
    "this in turn could make them candidates as `` pointer states . ''",
    "that is , it is possible that the right view of the quantum environment would make these states emerge naturally .",
    "thus , even the most fundamental questions can have a profitable launching point from our simple model calculations .",
