    "path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) methods provide a fundamental approach in the study of interacting quantum many - body systems at low temperatures .",
    "@xcite this accurate simulation tool relies on the well - known convolution property of the thermal density matrix which allows for estimating the density matrix at low temperature from their knowledge at higher temperature , where the system is well described by classical statistical mechanics .",
    "@xcite the partition function @xmath2 of the quantum system is then written as a multidimensional integral with a distribution law that resembles the one of a closed classical polymer with an inter - bead harmonic coupling . if one either ignores the quantum statistics of the particles ( _ boltzmanons _ ) , or they are bosons , then the statistical distribution law is positive definite and can be interpreted as a probability distribution function which can be sampled by standard metropolis monte carlo methods .",
    "the mapping of this finite - temperature quantum system to a classic system of polymers was already suggested by feynman  @xcite and implemented in practice by barker ,  @xcite and chandler and wolynes  @xcite in their pioneering works .    in the simplest and most common implementations of the pimc method the density matrix at high temperature , which constitutes the building block of the polymer chain ,",
    "is considered fully classical , i.e. , kinetic and potential parts of the action are splitted ignoring any contribution arising from the non - conmutativity of the kinetic @xmath3 and potential @xmath4 operators .",
    "this approximation is known as primitive action ( pa ) and is accurate to order @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the inverse temperature and @xmath7 the number of convolution terms ( beads ) . when the temperature decreases the number of beads to reach convergence in terms of @xmath8 increases and the system becomes more and more quantum . in the classical limit",
    ", pimc reduces to classic mc since the polymeric chain reduces to a single point ( @xmath9 ) . on the other hand , near the zero - temperature limit",
    "the chains acquire extensions comparable to the size of the simulation box .",
    "pa is accurate to study semiclassical systems in which the quantum effects are comparatively small and therefore the number of beads in the asymptotic regime is low enough for an efficient sampling .",
    "however , if the interest lies in a fully quantum regime at very cold temperatures , @xmath7 increases very fast making simulations hard , if not impossible , due to very low efficiency in the sampling of the long chains involved .",
    "the study of fully quantum fluids and solids require better actions than the pa .",
    "an accurate action to deal with very low temperatures , down to superfluid regimes , relies on the pair - product approximation  @xcite in which the basic piece of the pimc chain is the exact action for two isolated particles .",
    "the pair - product action has been used extensively in the study of superfluids and it is specially accurate for hard - spherelike systems such as liquid @xmath1he .",
    "@xcite however , its use for non - radial interactions is much more difficult due to the complexity of the pair density matrix . a different approach to improve the pa relies on the use of higher - order actions obtained directly from the exponential of the hamiltonian , @xmath10 . working in this direction , takahashi and imada  @xcite and later on , and independently , li and broughton  @xcite managed to write a new action ( tia ) which is accurate to fourth order @xmath11 for the trace . to this end",
    ", they incorporated in the expression for the action the double commutator @xmath12,\\hat{v}]$ ] .",
    "more recently , jang _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite proposed a new action based on the suzuki factorization  @xcite and accurate to fourth order . in spite of being a real fourth order action , and therefore better than the tia , the results obtained by jang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite do not show a significant improvement towards the reduction of the number of beads in the asymptote @xmath13 respect to the tia .    in the present work ,",
    "we introduce a new family of high order actions based on the symplectic developments of chin  @xcite and chin and chen  @xcite that have already proved its efficiency in solving the schrdinger equation ,  @xcite problems in classical mechanics ,  @xcite and in the implementation of evolution operators in density functional theory .",
    "@xcite in chin s factorization of the evolution operator all the coefficients are @xmath14 positive ( and therefore directly implementable in monte carlo simulations ) and @xmath15 continuously tunable , which makes possible to force the error terms of fourth order to roughly cancel each other for the specific range of time - step values of interest for the actual simulations .",
    "we have introduced this new action in our pimc algorithm and all the results presented in this article show that the accuracy achieved in terms of @xmath16 is sixth order in practice in spite of the fact that the action is only accurate to fourth order .",
    "the attained reduction in the number of beads makes this algorithm competitive with the pair - product approximation in the study of quantum fluids and solids at ultralow temperatures .",
    "the rest of the work is organized as follows .",
    "the action and the method used for the pimc simulation is contained in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we present results obtained with the chin s action for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator , a drop of h@xmath0 molecules , and bulk liquid @xmath1he at low temperatures .",
    "finally , a brief summary and the main conclusions are reported in sec .",
    "at finite temperature , the knowledge of the quantum partition function @xmath17 allows for a full microscopic description of the properties of a given system , with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the hamiltonian . in a @xmath20-particle system ,",
    "the kinetic operator is given by @xmath21 and the potential one , assuming pairwise interactions , by @xmath22 the non - conmutativity of the quantum operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 makes impractical a direct calculation of the partition function @xmath2 ( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "instead , all practical implementations intended for monte carlo estimations of @xmath2 rely on its convolution approximation @xmath23 with @xmath24 , where each one of the terms in the r.h.s .",
    "corresponds to a higher temperature @xmath25 . in the most simple approximation , known as primitive action ( pa ) , the kinetic and potential contributions factorize @xmath26 the convergence to the exact result being warranted by the trotter formula  @xcite @xmath27",
    "the primitive action is a particular case of a more general form in which one can decompose the action , that is @xmath28 with @xmath29 parameters to be determined according to the required accuracy of the approximation . as we are interested in the monte carlo implementation of eq .",
    "( [ suzukin ] ) , all these parameters must be positive .",
    "however , the sheng - suzuki  @xcite theorem proves that this is impossible beyond second order in @xmath30 .",
    "recently , chin  @xcite has analyzed these expansions ( [ suzukin ] ) for the estimation of the quantum partition function where only the trace is required ( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "as the trace is invariant under a similarity transformation @xmath31 , it could be possible to improve the order of the approximation by a proper choice of @xmath31 .",
    "however , chin  @xcite has proved that expansions like ( [ suzukin ] ) can not be corrected with @xmath31 beyond second order , generalizing in this form the sheng - suzuki theorem .",
    "@xcite    in order to overcome the limitation imposed by the sheng - suzuki  @xcite theorem it is necessary to include in the operator expansion terms with double commutators such as @xmath12,\\hat{v}]$ ] . in a recent work , chin  @xcite",
    "has proved that a second - order algorithm ( pa ) can be corrected by a similarity transformation if that commutator is introduced .",
    "the result yields the tia , with a trace that is accurate to fourth order .",
    "the tia improves significantly the accuracy of the pa in pimc simulations but not enough to deal properly with fully quantum fluids . in order to make a step",
    "further it is necessary to work directly with real fourth - order actions .",
    "chin and chen  @xcite have worked out a continuous family of gradient symplectic algorithms which are accurate to fourth order and that have proved to be extremely accurate in the resolution of classical and quantum problems .",
    "now , we extend the focus of its applicability to the pimc algorithm .    the fourth - order action we have used is a two - parameter model given explicitely by  @xcite @xmath32 hereafter referred as chin action ( ca ) .",
    "the generalized potentials @xmath33 resemble the one that appears in the tia since both incorporate the double commutator @xmath34,\\hat{v } ] = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{m } \\ , \\sum_{i=1}^{n }    \\label{commutator}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 the _ force _ acting on particle @xmath36 , @xmath37 the potentials @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( [ chinaction ] ) are explicitely @xmath38 the parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ chinaction ] ) and ( [ doblev1],[doblev ] ) are not all independent and can be written as a function of only two , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are restricted to fulfill the conditions @xmath41 the rest of parameters are obtained from the two independent ones @xmath42 according to the equations @xmath43 \\\\ v_1 & = & \\frac{1}{6 \\ , ( 1 - 2 t_0)^2 }   \\\\ v_2 & = & 1 -2 v_1 \\\\ t_1 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } -t_0   \\ . \\label{parameters+}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the accuracy of the ca depends on the particular values of @xmath39 and @xmath40 that have to be numerically optimized .",
    "each one modifies the action in different directions : @xmath40 controls the weight of the different parts in which the kinetic part is splitted ( [ chinaction ] ) and @xmath39 the weight of each part in which the double commutator is divided ( [ doblev ] ) .    restricting first our analysis to distinguishable particles , the quantum partition function @xmath2 ( [ zeta ] ) can be obtained through a multidimensional integral of the @xmath7 terms ( beads ) in which it is decomposed , @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the rest of the work , latin and greek indexes are used for particles and beads , respectively .",
    "the density matrix of each step in eq ( [ zeta2 ] ) is written in the ca , latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath73 stands for the three different types of internal beads , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 if @xmath78 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the implementation of the ca in the pimc algorithm is similar to the one for the tia .",
    "going from tia to ca , one has to split a single bead into three ( with different link lengths ) , but in these new beads the different atoms interact with a similar generalized potential , coming from the double commutator .",
    "a simple inspection on the equations of the density matrix and energies for the ca and tia shows that the complexity of both actions are essentially the same and require , for example , the same order of derivatives of the interatomic potential @xmath79 .",
    "a final concern that any pimc calculation must afford is whether the sampling method has the necessary efficiency in the movement of the chains to avoid the slowing down that can appear for long chains when using only individual bead movements . in this sense",
    ", the implementation in the algorithm of collective smart movements is crucial . to this end",
    ", we use the staging method  @xcite combined with movements of the center of mass of each one of the atoms . in the ca ,",
    "the length of each chain is not the same and therefore one has to generalize the staging method .",
    "this generalization is discussed in appendix a.",
    "we have studied the accuracy of the high - order action proposed by chin in three different systems : a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator , a drop of h@xmath0 molecules , and bulk liquid @xmath1he .",
    "the harmonic oscillator is a very simple system but it has the advantage of its exact analytic solution at any temperature which allows for an accurate test of the method .",
    "the h@xmath0 drop is a more exigent test and it has been adopted in previous works as benchmark for testing different actions . finally , liquid @xmath1he is also a well - known system with a wide experimental information available for comparison and with the appealing feature of remaining liquid even at zero temperature . in all the simulations",
    "we have used a sampling method which combines movements of the center of mass of the chains and smart movements of chain pieces with the staging technique .  @xcite the length of the staging chain and the maximum value of the displacement of the center of mass",
    "are chosen to achieve an acceptance rate of 30%-50% .",
    "the results presented below have been checked to be stable with respect to the frequency and size of both movements .      in our first application",
    ", we consider a particle in a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator with hamiltonian @xmath80 as it is well know , this problem can be exactly solved at any temperature and , in particular , the energy is given by  @xcite @xmath81 in the pimc simulations we have taken @xmath82 and the results presented correspond to temperatures @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the energies obtained at @xmath85 with different actions and as a function of the number of beads @xmath7 are contained in table [ t_harmonicoscillator02 ] , and have to be compared with the exact value 0.50678 . in order to reproduce the exact energy with these five digits pa requires the use of @xmath86 and tia of a quite smaller number @xmath87 .",
    "@xcite this asymptotic value is reached in the ca case with a sizeable smaller number : @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .    .pa",
    "( @xmath92 ) , tia ( @xmath93 ) , and ca ( @xmath94 ) results for the one - dimensional harmonic oscillator at @xmath85 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in the last decades there has been a continued effort for improving the action to be used in pimc simulations beyond the pa .",
    "working directly on the exponential of the hamiltonian , takahashi and imada  @xcite introduced in the action the double commutator @xmath12,\\hat{v}]$ ] and showed that the new algorithm ( tia ) was of fourth order . as showed in previous work ,",
    "@xcite the tia reduces significantly the number of beads to reach the asymptotic limit and therefore it can be very useful in quantum systems if the temperature is not very small .",
    "however , if one is interested on achieving lower temperatures , deep in the quantum regime , the tia is still not accurate enough since the number of beads required is yet too large . as pointed out by chin ,",
    "@xcite this relative failure of tia is due to the fact that the tia is in fact a fourth - order action but only for the trace .",
    "posterior attempts of improving the action ,  @xcite based on actions proposed by suzuki ,  @xcite did not show a significant enhancement of the efficiency of the method with respect to tia .    following with the aim of going a step further on the improvement of the action for pimc applications , we have used for the first time the new developments of chin  @xcite that have led to full fourth - order expansions of the exponential of the hamiltonian .",
    "the resulting action ( ca ) is more involved than the tia and suzuki action but still it is readily implementable starting on a tia approach since the basic ingredients of the ca are already contained in the tia . in table [ t_conclu ] , we compare the efficiency of the three models for the action ; the numbers correspond to the calculation of liquid @xmath1he but are similar to the ones obtained in the study of the h@xmath0 drop . considering as 1 the cpu time per bead and the efficiency in the pa one observes that the cost per bead in tia is @xmath95 and the number of beads is 4 times smaller , leading to en efficiency @xmath96 . in the ca , the cpu cost per bead is larger since every step @xmath30 is splitted into three but the big decrease in the number of beads ( 58 times smaller than in pa ) results in an efficiency 8 times larger than the pa .",
    "in the chin action there are two parameters ( @xmath40 , @xmath39 ) that have to be optimized .",
    "the search of these parameters for a given system is not difficult since they are independent of temperature and therefore they can be found at higher temperatures where the number of beads is very small and consequently the simulations very short in cpu time .",
    "as we have discussed in the harmonic oscillator problem , the exact energy is crossed by changing @xmath40 because the departure from the asymptote can be upwards or downwards depending on its particular value .",
    "this behavior makes possible to search for optimal parameters that improve the efficiency of the action from fourth - order to an effective sixth order .",
    "this behavior is not only characteristic of the harmonic oscillator but completely general as we have verified in real many - body problems as the h@xmath0 drop and bulk liquid @xmath1he .",
    "this sixth - order law is maintained even at superfluid temperatures making that the number of beads required for the simulations is completely manageable .",
    "therefore , the ca is a realistic alternative to the pair action for dealing with quantum liquids and solids in the superfluid regime at temperatures close to zero .",
    "its implementation is not much more involved than the tia , easier to use than the pair action , and useful also for problems with non - radial interactions where the application of pair action is much more involved .",
    "work is also in progress to use the ca in a path integral ground state ( pigs ) approach to study the limit of zero temperature , the initial simulations showing also a sixth - order accuracy and convergence to the exact energies with a few number of beads .",
    "we wish to thank stimulating discussions with siu chin about high order actions .",
    "partial financial support from dgi ( spain ) grant no .",

    "catalunya grant no .",
    "2005sgr-00779 are also aknowledged .",
    "the staging technique allows for a direct sampling of the free ( kinetic ) part of the action , i.e. , metropolis test is not necessary . in this appendix",
    ", we generalize the standard staging method to the one required for the ca action where the _ width _ of a given bead depend of its type ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) ( [ fullrho ] ) .",
