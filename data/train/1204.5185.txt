    "voids represent a unique environment for the study of galaxy evolution @xcite . the lower density environment , equivalent to a lower @xmath12 universe @xcite , should result in shorter merger histories and slower evolution of galaxies . as different mechanisms of gas accretion are believed to dominate in low mass halos , voids present a unique environment in which to search for signs of ongoing cold mode accretion @xcite .",
    "the nature of these void galaxies also provides a test of cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology theory , which predicts that these underdense regions should be filled with low mass dark matter halos that are not observed as low luminosity galaxies @xcite .",
    "this may have implications for galaxy formation through the suppression of star formation in the lowest mass halos @xcite , and may provide general insights into how galaxies populate dark matter halos @xcite    observations of void galaxies selected by different methods consistently show that they are typically low luminosity and late type disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "they are blue with elevated specific star formation rates @xcite , though it is not clear if these characteristics are different from low luminosity disk galaxies in average density environments @xcite . as the observed shift in the luminosity function results naturally from cdm cosmology @xcite , it is possible that the large scale underdensity surrounding void galaxies has little effect on the evolution of these systems .",
    "we are undertaking a multi - wavelength study of 60 void galaxies as part of a new void galaxy survey ( vgs , see @xcite ) .",
    "a variety of different techniques have been developed to identify voids and void galaxies within galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "@xcite provides an interesting comparison of the results of different void - finding algorithms applied to a single set of simulation data .",
    "these techniques generally agree in locating large scale underdensities , however the extent and shape of the identified voids differ dramatically .",
    "we employ a powerful geometric method that makes no assumption about the size or shape of the voids within a galaxy distribution .",
    "this unique approach allows us to robustly identify a void galaxy population suitable for systematic study .",
    "the earliest void galaxy surveys were severely biased by the selection methods , targeting only emission - line @xcite or iras bright @xcite galaxies .",
    "subsequent void galaxy studies based on more uniformly selected redshift surveys with denser coverage were also biased by the shallow depth available and select only the more luminous void galaxies @xcite , which do not represent the bulk of the low luminosity void galaxy population .",
    "we use the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7 ( dr7 ) , which contains uniform photometry and spectroscopic distances to all galaxies over a quarter of the sky that are brighter than 17.77 @xmath13-band magnitudes , and focus on relatively nearby galaxies ( d @xmath14 100 mpc ) allowing us to probe void galaxies to m@xmath8 = -17 . in this paper",
    "we discuss the sdss optical properties of 60 void galaxies , carefully selected by their geometry to be centrally located within the deepest underdensities , and we discuss the neutral gas content in 55 of these systems observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "the wsrt employs a new backend that enables us to simultaneously image a wide velocity range encompassing the full radial extent of the void with high sensitivity , and good velocity and spatial resolution to trace gas morphology and kinematics of both the target and any neighboring galaxies within the void .",
    "systematic h i imaging of void galaxies has been undertaken by @xcite , who identified 24 iras selected galaxies within the botes void .",
    "their targets were generally gas rich and late type , with h i morphologies consistent with similar galaxies in the field , though their sample suffers from contamination by galaxies in higher density substructures within the void @xcite .",
    "single dish observations of dwarf galaxies identify targets in the void as having slightly higher h i mass to light ratio @xcite , though the sample size is small .",
    "h i blind observations of voids have not revealed a large number of uncataloged detections ( @xcite , @xcite ) .    in section [ sec : selection ] we describe our methods for identifying voids and void galaxies .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] outlines the h i observations undertaken at the wsrt , and section [ sec : results ] details our results .",
    "we discuss the significance and implications of this work in section [ sec : discussion ] , and include a full catalog of the h i and sdss optical data for the sample in appendix [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we assume h@xmath15 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "a complete description of our void finding method and void galaxy selection criteria are presented in the pilot study for this project @xcite .",
    "we summarize here the main points of our technique and refer the reader to the more detailed description previously published and references therein .",
    "we apply the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfevoronoi / dtfe / dtfe.html @xcite ] ; @xcite ) to the sdss redshift survey .",
    "we use these galaxies , independent of their luminosity , as tracers to recover the underlying galaxy density field within the local universe . using redshift as a proxy for distance",
    ", we construct the delaunay tessellation of the three - dimensional galaxy distribution and estimate the local density at each galaxy location on the basis of the inverse of the corresponding contiguous voronoi cell .",
    "the density field throughout the sample volume consists of the linear piecewise interpolation of the density values over the corresponding dual delaunay tessellation . after weighing the resulting density field for the radial selection function of the sdss survey , i.e. the decrease in luminosity sensitivity as a function of redshift",
    ", we apply a @xmath16mpc gaussian smoothing filter to obtained galaxy density field .    the void identification proceeds by treating the reconstructed density field as a landscape of hills and valleys that is slowly flooded . as neighboring valleys fill and intervening hills are submerged we identify void substructure and boundaries at these higher density regions . in this way we outline the void shapes , without imposing requirements of spherical voids or selection of a local minimum , and are able to unambiguously identify galaxies that reside within the voids .",
    "this watershed transform results in basins that are identified as voids by the watershed voidfinder algorithm @xcite , and the corresponding boundaries are subsequently identified as walls and filaments using the cosmic spine formalism @xcite .",
    "we have selected a sample of 60 galaxies located in the local universe using voids identified within the sdss dr7 .",
    "a redshift limit of @xmath17 is imposed to maximize the h i sensitivity and spatial resolution considering the @xmath18 resolution of the wsrt .",
    "we also exclude any galaxies within @xmath19750 km s@xmath11 of the line of sight of a cluster to avoid contamination by redshift distortions , such as the finger of god effect . an initial sample of galaxies is selected to have a density contrast , @xmath20 , of less than -0.5 , where @xmath21 is the mean density estimated for the sdss .",
    "we then choose only those galaxies most centrally located within their void and away from the sdss boundaries so the surrounding void is well contained within the redshift survey .",
    "all galaxies were selected purely on the grounds of their location within the geometrically determined outline of the voids in the sdss galaxy distribution , with no bias for morphology , luminosity or color outside of the inherent sdss redshift survey limitations .",
    "this is clear when observing the range of galaxy type in the sdss color images as scaled to the same physical size ( see figure [ fig : poststamps ] ) .",
    "the sdss positions of all 60 galaxies are shown in figure [ fig : voids ] .",
    "we observed a total of 55 of the 60 vgs galaxies at the wsrt between 2006 - 2010 , with the instrumental parameters given in table [ tab : obsparams ] .",
    "we list the properties measured from the sdss in table [ tab : params ] .",
    "all targets were observed in maxi - short configuration , with shortest baselines of 36 , 54 , 72 and 90 meters to maximize surface brightness sensitivity and a longest baseline of 2754 meters to achieve angular resolutions of @xmath22 using an optimal u , v taper for the detection of low surface brightness emission .",
    "this corresponds to spatial scales of @xmath198 kpc at 85 mpc , the average distance for our sample . as the wsrt is an east - west array , we scheduled full 12 hour track observations to achieve complete uv coverage of each target , however a number of our observations were interrupted by priority target of opportunity observations .",
    "some , but not all , of our incomplete observations were completed at later times .",
    "the final total integration time for all galaxies not detected in h i is at least 10.5 hours .",
    "the final total integration time for detected galaxies is at least 8 hours , with only vgs_18 having just 5 hours .",

    "the galex arecibo sdss survey ( gass ) compares the sfe for a large sample of galaxies with stellar masses above @xmath71 m@xmath4 , and finds it stays relatively constant at log@xmath72(sfe ) @xmath19 -9.5 when considered as a function of parameters such as stellar mass , color , and morphology @xcite .",
    "only four galaxies in the vgs have stellar masses within this range , two of which are detected and have log@xmath72(sfe ) of -8.6 and -9.1 , higher than the average and suggestive that void galaxies are somewhat more efficient in their star formation .",
    "two are not detected in h i , with lower limits on the log@xmath72(sfe ) of -10 and -9.1 .",

    "the medians of both samples ( lines ) agree quite well , suggesting that buildup of the stellar disks in the vgs is appropriate to their smaller sizes .",
    "[ fig : ssfrsdss],width=307 ]",
    "given the observed h i and optical properties of the vgs , we consider what role the large scale environment might play in the evolution of these systems and the implications for cosmology .",
    "the strong disturbances we observe in the h i morphologies and kinematics ( see section [ sec : morphkin ] ) present convincing evidence for ongoing gas accretion in these systems .",
    "none of the galaxies with lopsided h i disks highlighted in figure [ fig : examples2 ] have companions detected in h i , however these galaxies are small enough , with h i radii of @xmath1910 kpc and rotational velocities of @xmath19150 km s@xmath11 , that rotation timescales are only a few hundred million years and without recent gas accretion these disks are expected to settle in much less than a hubble time @xcite .",
    "however it is difficult to distinguish the effects of different gas accretion mechanisms , such as interactions , internal gas recycling , and cosmological inflow .",
    "simulations suggest that gas accreted from the intergalactic medium can either be shock heated to form a hot halo or can penetrate directly to the halo center as a cold flow , depending on the halo mass . for low mass halos , found predominantly at higher redshifts and at @xmath73 in low density environments , these cold flows may be the dominant mechanism for galaxy growth @xcite .",
    "this appears to be the case for vgs_12 , which was found to have an extremely extended and massive h i disk oriented perpendicular to the direction of the stellar disk , and is discussed at length in @xcite .",
    "the polar disk is devoid of stars , and the central stellar disk has retained its rotational support , suggesting a slow accretion of polar material .",
    "this mechanism for the formation of polar disks has also been suggested for ngc 4650a @xcite , and has been reproduced in simulations @xcite . in the vgs we also find two systems , vgs_38 and vgs_31 , with three galaxies linearly aligned and joined by low column density h i , that is very suggestive of filamentary formation .",
    "hierarchical void theory predicts that void galaxies will reside in relatively low density substructure within the void @xcite , which has been observed in simulations @xcite as well as in nearby voids @xcite , and the vgs systems present a unique location to search for surrounding low column density intergalactic gas .",
    "further evidence of gas accretion in void galaxies can be found in the literature .",
    "individual studies of dwarf galaxies in voids suggest that they are uniquely unevolved , with lower metallicities and higher star formation rates than typical dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "kk 246 , a dwarf galaxy in the local void , has an extremely extended h i disk and evidence of gas at anomalous velocities compared to regular disk rotation @xcite .",
    "ngc 6946 has been imaged in h i because of its unusual gas kinematics and signs of gas infall @xcite , and was selected for these characteristics independent of its location within the local void @xcite .",
    "individually , these examples are interesting , but taken together they convincingly show that voids are a uniquely promising place to search for evidence of ongoing gas accretion .      to carefully examine the integrated h i properties for our sample considering their biased morphology , luminosity and stellar mass distributions , we have constructed an environmentally constrained control galaxy sample by cross - matching galaxies in five publicly available catalogs of the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ; @xcite ) with the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the alfalfa catalog identifies h i detected galaxies with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 6.5 sigma , as well as marginal detections between 4 and 6.5 sigma that have clear optical counterparts .",
    "the alfa receiver s 3.5 arcminute beam allows sufficient resolution to uniquely determine a corresponding optical counterpart for almost all cataloged h i detections , though confusion of sources within the beam can be an issue for more distant targets .",
    "we have restricted this control sample to a redshift range of @xmath74 and a volume limited subset with m@xmath75 m@xmath4 to approximately match the h i sensitivity limits to the wsrt observations ( figure [ fig : ctrlhist ] , see also section [ sec : observations ] ) . following the cross - matching technique described in @xcite , we require that the optical counterpart centers agree in each catalog by less than 10@xmath26 , a typical minimum size for the optical disks of galaxies in that redshift range .",
    "we also require that the optical and h i redshift velocities agree by less than 300 km s@xmath11 , though most source optical redshifts are within @xmath1930 km s@xmath11 of the h i detection .",
    "we omit any targets flagged as suffering from confusion within the beam , and we further exclude 24 galaxies from this cross - matched catalog that are identified within the sdss redshift survey to have close companions , within 2@xmath30 and a velocity difference of ( w@xmath35/2 + 50 km s@xmath11 ) .",
    "we recalculate the distances for the alfalfa detections and adjust the h i masses based on the hubble flow velocity , instead of the cataloged cmb velocity , to remove any bias when comparing with the vgs . given the imposed lower limit on the redshift range this does not significantly affect our distance estimates .",
    "we identify 447 galaxies for this control sample , with 207 in the volume limited subsample .",
    "as expected , the bulk of the control sample galaxies are located at average densities , with a limited number in voids and clusters ( figure [ fig : ctrlhist ] ) .",

    "[ fig : ctrlhist],title=\"fig:\",width=182 ]    we find that late type ( r@xmath53/r@xmath78 ) void galaxies have approximately the same median h  i mass to light ratios at fixed luminosity as compared to late type galaxies in the volume limited alfalfa control sample ( figure [ fig : mhilight2 ] , left ) . here",
    "the void sample has been subjected to the same volume limited ( m@xmath79 m@xmath4 ) restrictions to avoid a malmquist bias .",
    "the slight systematic offset to lower values is approximately equal to the typical errors due to uncertainty in the h i mass , however the lack of high h i mass to light ratio galaxies in the vgs brighter than m@xmath80 is striking . as this effect is not apparent when comparing with the whisp and ursa major cluster galaxies ( figure [ fig : mhilight ] )",
    ", we consider whether the total h i masses may be affected by instrumental differences between the wsrt and arecibo observations .",
    "three galaxies in the vgs sample overlap with the alfalfa control , and for these we find h i masses that agree within the quoted errors .",
    "it is also possible that the h i mass mesaurements are strongly contaminated by confusion within the alfalfa beam , which would result on average in an overestimate of the total h i mass . at a redshift of @xmath81",
    "the 3.5@xmath30 beam includes any emission within a physical distance of @xmath1950 kpc , approximately the distance from the milky way to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "this is a relatively small separation , for example five of the target galaxies in the vgs sample when observed by arecibo would potentially suffer from confusion with their nearby companions , resulting in mass increases of up to a factor of two .",
    "there are further concerns with the absolute mass measured in the alfalfa sample .",
    "@xcite examined a sample of cross - matched sdss and alfalfa galaxies , and for a subsample of well resolved galaxies with known morphological type and optical diameter they calculated the expected h i mass following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they reported a negative h i deficiency of 20 - 30% which increases with redshift , suggesting that their h i masses may be overestimated , however they attribute this to the omission of h i deficient galaxies below the survey detection limits , the inclusion of more gas rich late type galaxies , as well as a difference in the methods used compared to previous work .",
    "while these concerns affect the comparison of absolute h i flux measurements , they should not affect relative comparisons within the alfalfa sample .",
    "in fact , we observe a similarly decreased h i mass to light ratio when comparing the low density ( @xmath82 ) subset of alfalfa control galaxies with average density alfalfa galaxies ( figure [ fig : mhilight2 ] , right ) .",
    "for both the low density alfalfa galaxies and the vgs , the galaxies in low density regions appear to have an h i mass to light ratio that is approximately 10 - 20% lower than that of galaxies in average density environments .",
    "we consider such a large contribution to the total h i mass by confusion unlikely but possible , as this would require a strongly environmental effect , with gas - rich galaxies in low density regions less clustered .",
    "this is in contradiction with our own findings ( see section [ sec : clustering ] ) .",
    "we find very few void galaxies with high h i gas masses , and at the high stellar mass end we find no vgs galaxies with h i mass above @xmath83 m@xmath4 .",

    "[ fig : jplot],width=307 ]    the h i mass to light ratio is in some ways a rough proxy for comparing the h i and stellar masses of a system .",
    "as the sdss spectra allow us to more directly estimate the total mass in stars , we can in this case make an explicit comparison .",
    "figure [ fig : jplot ] shows the h i mass as a function of stellar mass , as taken from the mpa - jhu catalog ( see section [ sec : sdssprop ] ) , for the vgs and alfalfa average and underdense samples , with a line indicating equal amounts of mass in stars and gas .",
    "we note that in all environments there is a smaller range in h i masses than stellar masses , and a rather sharp transition between gas dominated and stellar mass dominated galaxies .",
    "almost no galaxies with stellar masses below 10@xmath86 m@xmath4 have less h i than stars , and almost no galaxies with stellar masses above 10@xmath87 m@xmath4 have more gas than stars . given the range of stellar masses probed by these void galaxies , there appear to be very few with high h i masses above @xmath192 @xmath23 10@xmath86 m@xmath4 , and none above @xmath83 m@xmath4 , though this is routinely found for galaxies in average density environments .",
    "the agreement between all samples appears somewhat better at low @xmath1910@xmath88 m@xmath4 stellar masses .",
    "unfortunately , as alfalfa is biased towards detecting targets with higher h i masses above @xmath89 m@xmath4 , it is misleading to compare the mass distribution of our vgs targets directly with alfalfa .",
    "we also compare the normalized star formation of the vgs galaxies with the average density alfalfa galaxies ( figure [ fig : sfe ] , top ) .",
    "we find good agreement between the ssfrs when comparing the volume limited vgs and average density alfalfa samples , which we also find when comparing with a magnitude limited sample of sdss galaxies ( see section [ sec : sfr ] ) .",
    "this suggests that star formation per stellar mass is the same in voids as in higher density environments .",
    "however the sfe appears systematically higher ( figure [ fig : sfe ] , bottom ) , as was already suggested by our pilot study .",

    "molecular gas has been found to contribute significantly more to the baryonic gas fraction in galaxies at higher redshift , in an earlier phase of their evolution @xcite .",
    "it is possible to over - estimate the rotational velocity in systems that are not spatially resolved , as rotation curves can be somewhat centrally peaked , and in fact the agreement is much better when we consider only galaxies with flattened rotation curves resolved ( figure [ fig : tf ] , filled symbols ) . for those galaxies without a turnover observed in the rotation curve , turbulent motions in the disk or beam smearing of central bulge effects on the kinematics may result in overestimation of the rotational velocity width .",

    "also serves as a blind search in h i for galaxies throughout the voids .",
    "there has been much debate on the expected distribution of galaxies in the void given a cdm cosmology , which arguably predicts a large population of faint galaxies that fill the void but has not been detected ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we probe with the wsrt a total volume in voids of 485 mpc@xmath0 around the targeted void galaxies , and are sensitive to targets down to @xmath1910@xmath88 m@xmath4 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the 1100 mpc@xmath0 probed by @xcite in the botes void , but an order of magnitude deeper in h i mass sensitivity .",
    "it is equivalent to the volume and sensitivity reached with h i blind searches within the pisces - persius void , where no void galaxies are detected @xcite .",

    "this small ( @xmath195% ) fraction is suggestive of an extension of the morphology - density relation to the deepest underdensities of the voids , as was also found by @xcite .",
    "we note that in our sample of 60 galaxies none have radio agns , which has been suggested as a secular mechanism for halting star formation in void galaxies @xcite .",

    "the star formation rates normalized by the stellar mass is average given their stellar mass , however there is a hint that the star formation rates normalized by the h i mass is higher in the voids , making them slightly more efficient at forming stars .",

    "this appendix presents an image atlas of the 60 galaxies comprising the void galaxy survey , as well as an h i atlas presenting an overview of our observations of 55 of the vgs targets and the vgs companions detected in h i. these are followed by a brief discussion of some individually interesting galaxies in our sample .",

    "seven of these are shown in figure [ fig : vgs ] along with the target galaxies , and the remaining 11 are shown in figure [ fig : comps ] . as many of these targets are observed within the primary beam but removed from the beam center , the h i sensitivity is typically somewhat worse for these detections than for the primary targets .",
    "thus we show here the h i contours for these detections with a lowest contour at 3@xmath28 , and indicate the corresponding column density in the upper right corner of each image .",

    "the hi distribution appears quite regular both morphologically and kinematically , though the gas disk may be slightly offset from the center of the stellar disk .",
