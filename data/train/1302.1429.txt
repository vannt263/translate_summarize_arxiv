    "there have been many remarkable discoveries of superconducting compounds that are almost antiferromagnetic . some have unconventional broken symmetries with very high transition temperatures such as with the cuprates or with multiple vortex phases like the heavy fermion compound upt@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite the recently discovered iron - pnictide family is in a new class which appear to be conventional but with an interplay with magnetism that is not well understood .",
    "an important question in all of these cases is whether an appropriate theoretical starting point is the classic work of bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer  @xcite ( bcs ) where electrons conventionally form cooper pairs of opposite spin and angular momenta , weakly coupled together .",
    "unconventional cooper pairing was first found in liquid @xmath7he  @xcite where attraction between fermions originates from spin - fluctuations in a nearly - magnetic fermi liquid , a rather different mechanism for superconductivity than proposed by bcs . nonetheless , it is important to keep in mind that the bcs weak - coupling framework accurately accounts for the thermodynamics of this superfluid including its spin susceptibility .",
    "the proximity of superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in pnictide materials is similarly suggestive , but a comparison to bcs theory has not yet been established .",
    "these superconductors are inherently multi - band with different pairing strengths and energy gaps on hole and electron portions of their fermi surface , complicating the interpretation of experiments .    however , for one of the pnictide family , nafe@xmath8co@xmath9as , angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite , @xmath10=0.050 , and scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements  @xcite , @xmath10=0.025,0.050 ,",
    "indicate that it has a single energy gap or two gaps of the same size . in this case",
    "a thermodynamic analysis of the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility is straightforward .",
    "we have performed @xmath0as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) knight shift measurements of the spin susceptibility on clean crystals of nafe@xmath1co@xmath2as ( naco25 ) to show that opposite spins pair in a singlet state , quantitatively following the temperature dependence expected from the weak - coupling bcs theory expressed by the yosida function .",
    "an essential step in our procedure to extract the spin part of the knight shift is to measure the local diamagnetic fields from @xmath3na nmr and subtract them from the @xmath0as spectra .",
    "our @xmath0as and @xmath3na nmr experiments were performed at northwestern university from 4.2 k to room temperature with external magnetic field @xmath11 t parallel to the @xmath12-axis . because of the high reactivity of na we used an environmentally sealed sample holder , fig.1(a ) , made out of glass or stycast 1266@xmath13 .",
    "the containers were filled with helium in an oxygen free chamber to prevent sample degradation and to exchange heat .",
    "degradation can be identified over time from an increase in the nmr linewidth and consequently several different crystals were used . in the work we report here , both nuclei exhibited very narrow nmr spectra at room temperature : 8 khz for @xmath0as , and 3 khz for @xmath3na .",
    "crystals with dimensions @xmath14 mm@xmath15 were grown at the university of tennessee and found to have @xmath16 of 21 k from magnetization with @xmath17 g parallel to the @xmath18-plane , fig.1(b ) .",
    "spin - echo sequences ( @xmath19 - @xmath20 ) were used to obtain spectra , knight shift , and spin - lattice relaxation rate , @xmath21 , from the central transition ( -1/2 @xmath221/2 ) with a @xmath20-pulse @xmath23 8 @xmath24sec .",
    "the spin - spin relaxation time , @xmath25 , was measured with a carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg ) sequence and @xmath26 was obtained with a saturation recovery method for @xmath27 sec . for longer @xmath26 the more efficient progressive saturation technique  @xcite was used .",
    "the narrow linewidths confirm high sample quality . as with other pnictide superconductors",
    "@xcite naco25 shows a continuous decrease on cooling from room temperature above @xmath16 .",
    "below @xmath16 = 18 k ( blue trace ) the spectra shift noticeably to lower frequency with onset of superconductivity .",
    "the increased linewidth on cooling below @xmath16 is due to the formation of a vortex lattice.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the @xmath0as and @xmath3na nmr spectra are shown in fig.1(c ) and ( d ) . from room temperature to just above the transition temperature , @xmath28 k in 6.4 t , the linewidths of the spectra are very narrow , less than 10 khz , and have very weak dependence on temperature , a clear indication of high crystal quality . on cooling from high temperatures in the normal state , both @xmath0as and @xmath3na spectra shift to lower frequency as has been observed in other pnictide superconductors .",
    "@xcite the superconducting transition at @xmath16 , is evident in an abrupt decrease in the peak frequency of the spectra , fig.2 .",
    "formation of the vortex lattice generates an inhomogeneous distribution of local fields , broadening both spectra in the superconducting state .",
    "the measured nmr frequency shift , @xmath29 , relative to the larmor frequency , @xmath30 , can be expressed as , @xmath31    as and @xmath3na over a wide temperature range .",
    "( a ) the decrease of @xmath32 in the normal state on cooling is characteristic of pnictide superconductors .",
    "( b ) the low temperature behavior of @xmath33 , after subtraction of @xmath34 , is fitted to a yosida function ,  @xcite solid curve , with @xmath35/@xmath36 = 4.0 which we interpret as evidence for weak - coupling superconductivity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    generically referred to as the knight shift , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for each nucleus , determined from the peak positions of the spectra in fig.2 .",
    "the knight shift has electron spin , @xmath39 , orbital , @xmath40 , quadrupolar , @xmath41 , and @xmath34 terms , the latter from the superconducting diamagnetism , @xmath42 with demagnetization factor , @xmath43 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 provide a temperature independent offset . in the normal state the temperature dependence comes from @xmath44 , given by the spin susceptibility , @xmath45 , and its corresponding hyperfine coupling , @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "k the different temperature dependence of @xmath37 and @xmath38 is due to a much smaller hyperfine field for na as compared to as , which we estimate to be @xmath48 . for @xmath49",
    "k the comparison of @xmath38 with @xmath37 indicates @xmath50 is negligible and @xmath51 .",
    "the decrease of @xmath38 in the superconducting state is due entirely to @xmath52 and provides an internal measure of the local field that can be subtracted from @xmath37 to give a precise determination of the spin shift , @xmath53 , fig.2(b ) , proportional to the spin susceptibility .",
    "based on arpes  @xcite and stm  @xcite experiments we infer that there is a single isotropic superconducting energy gap in naco25 .",
    "even though the sizes of the superconducting gaps from different arpes measurements in nafe@xmath54co@xmath55as ( naco50 ) are different , they are consistent in two ways : the energy gaps in naco50 are isotropic , and the sizes of the gaps on the electron and hole fermi surfaces are almost identical .",
    "@xcite consequently , we fit the temperature dependence of @xmath33 to an isotropic yosida function , @xmath56 ,  @xcite eq.2 , to determine the energy gap , @xmath57 . allowing for strong coupling ,",
    "we take @xmath57 to be scaled  @xcite by a factor @xmath58 from the weak - coupling bcs energy gap , @xmath59 , represented in eq.3 by a convenient analytical form ,  @xcite and then we fit the measured knight shift to determine @xmath58 and hence @xmath57 .    , from @xmath0as and @xmath3na .",
    "the increase of @xmath60 ( blue circles ) on cooling in the normal state is due to spin fluctuations ,  @xcite and drops for @xmath61 with the onset of superconductivity . despite the small hyperfine field , @xmath62 ,",
    "has a similar behavior near @xmath16 ( red circles ) .",
    "scaling the rates by the square of the ratio of the hyperfine fields and their respective gyromagnetic ratios gives the open green triangles for the expected contribution at the na site .",
    "what remains is a second component of relaxation ( red dashed curve ) of unknown origin.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for @xmath63 , @xmath64 where @xmath65  @xcite and @xmath66 is 1.43 .    with this procedure",
    "we find the superconducting gap size to be @xmath67 mev , @xmath68 = 4.0 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the resultant fit is shown in fig.2.(b ) .",
    "our result is slightly larger than the bcs limit and supports the basic idea that superconductivity in naco25 is weakly - coupled consistent with a recent arpes measurement .",
    "@xcite stm measurements  @xcite on the same material and from the same source as ours , reports a larger energy gap of 5.5 mev .",
    "it is not clear what is the origin of this difference except that one measurement is for the charge channel and the other for spin .",
    "it is interesting anecdotally that the bosonic mode reported in that work is close in energy , within 8% , to @xmath70 inferred from the spin - knight shift .",
    "we also report our measurements of spin - lattice relaxation rates for both @xmath0as and @xmath3na nmr and the evidence they provide for spin fluctuations in the normal and superconducting states .",
    "importantly , the comparison between the rates for the two nuclei confirm the relative magnitude of the hyperfine fields we deduced from knight shifts at high temperatures .",
    "this supports our claim that @xmath3na is largely uncoupled from superconductivity and can serve as a spectator nucleus for the measurement of diamagnetic local fields .    as and @xmath3na central transition , and the spin - spin relaxation time , @xmath25 .",
    "the narrow linewidths at @xmath71 k from @xmath0as ( 10 khz ) and @xmath3na ( 3 khz ) and the weak temperature dependences indicate high crystal quality . below @xmath72",

    "we have found different behavior for @xmath60 and @xmath62 , fig.3 . in the normal state",
    ", @xmath60 increases with decreasing temperature approaching @xmath16 and can be understood in terms of spin fluctuations  @xcite expressed in terms of the moriya theory ,  @xcite eq.5.the increase is suppressed with the onset of superconductivity , so that @xmath60 drops dramatically below @xmath16 , apparently strongly dependent on the density of normal quasiparticle excitations . for na",
    "we find that @xmath62 has a component that mimics this behavior and can be accounted for by the weak hyperfine coupling strength , @xmath80 . scaling the rates by the square of the ratio of the hyperfine fields and their respective gyromagnetic ratios , gives the open green triangles in fig.3 .",
    "subtracting this spin - fluctuation component of @xmath62 leaves a second contribution represented by the dashed red curve .",
    "we speculate that the spin - fluctuations come from q @xmath23 ( @xmath20,0 ) or ( 0,@xmath20 ) and that the remaining contribution might be from , q @xmath23 ( 0,0 ) not significantly affected by superconductivity , but of unknown origin .    as and ( b)@xmath3na .",

    "the linewidths of the central transitions of @xmath0as and @xmath3na are shown in fig.4 .",
    "below @xmath16 the linewidths from both samples broaden due to vortices and approach a constant at low temperature approximately at the minimum in @xmath87 , which we identify with the formation of a robust vortex solid . in our earlier work on co doped ba(fe@xmath88co@xmath89)@xmath90as@xmath90",
    "@xcite we have associated a minimum @xmath25 with the irreversibility temperature where vortices become pinned . although @xmath3na nmr is not as effective as @xmath0as nmr for probing the electronic excitations , it nonetheless provides a higher resolution tool for analysis of the spectrum in the superconducting state which is affected by vortices and from which we can determine the penetration depth , @xmath82 .",
    "the comparisons between the superconducting state spectra and the normal state spectra in fig.5 , indicate an increase in the high frequency portion of the spectrum as expected in a vortex solid . we have solved the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations in an ideal vortex lattice using brandt s algorithm ,  @xcite where we set @xmath91 = 36 t.  @xcite the resulting best fit distribution of local fields for @xmath3na at @xmath92 k",
