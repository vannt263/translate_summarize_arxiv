    "our starting point is a discretization of ( [ 1 ] ) on a simplicial manifold representing spacetime .",
    "this is made of 4-simplices glued along common tetrahedra .",
    "each 4-simplex has five tetrahedra and ten triangles .",
    "the fields @xmath5 and @xmath2 are then discretized and quantized , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the @xmath5 field since our purpose is to show how to deal with the constraints @xmath13 $ ] . at the quantum level",
    ", a representation of @xmath19 is associated to each triangle @xmath21 and the variables @xmath22 are represented as the @xmath23-generator @xmath24 in that representation .",
    "then gauge invariance allows us to associate a quantum state to each tetrahedron , given by the intertwiner between the four representations attached to its four boundary triangles , i.e a @xmath19-invariant state in the tensor product of these four representations .",
    "notice that in this procedure a tetrahedron state is uniquely defined by the tetrahedron irrespective to the 4-simplex to which it belongs .",
    "finally , a quantum 4-simplex consists in the ten representations labeling its triangles and the five quantum states associated to its tetrahedra . tensoring these tetrahedron states and tracing out over the representations , we get a scalar amplitude for each 4-simplex .",
    "the spinfoam amplitude is defined as the product of these 4-simplex amplitudes .",
    "the topological bf theory is obtained by allowing all irreducible ( unitary ) representations for triangles and all intertwiner states for tetrahedra . a constrained bf theory such as gravity restrains both the representations and the intertwiner spaces .",
    "for instance , the barrett - crane model uses the simple representations of @xmath25 and the unique barrett - crane intertwiner .",
    "so there are no degrees of freedom in the intertwiner space . here",
    "we will relax the way of imposing the simplicity constraints in order to enlarge the intertwiner space .",
    "the @xmath13 $ ] constraints usually read for all space - time indices ( greek letters ) : [ 2 ] _ ijklb^ij_b^kl _ = _ b4 ! , with @xmath26 .",
    "they ensure that @xmath5 comes from a tetrad field @xmath12 @xcite . at the canonical level , ( [ 2 ] )",
    "translates into second class constraints : a set of primary constraints ensuring that the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath12 holds on the canonical hypersurface , plus a set of secondary constraints ensuring that it also holds under time evolution .",
    "both sets of constraints are essential to compute the dirac bracket on the phase space @xcite .",
    "a criticism of the spinfoam quantization is that it seems to take into account only the primary constraints @xcite .",
    "we address this issue below , and identify the secondary constraints .",
    "notice also that in the lorentzian case the secondary constraints correspond to the reality constraints of self - dual loop gravity , so it would be enlightening to understand how spinfoams deal with them .",
    "3 cm    since the building elements of spinfoams are the 4-simplices , we now look in details at the simplicity constraints within each 4-simplex .",
    "we call @xmath27 the five tetrahedra of the 4-simplex",
    ". the adjacient picture shows the dual 4-simplex .",
    "each of the ten triangles is labeled by a pair of tetrahedra sharing it , e.g. @xmath28 .",
    "consider the discrete variables @xmath29 within the 4-simplex .",
    "first , they are constrained to satisfy a closure condition for each tetrahedron , namely @xmath30 for the tetrahedron @xmath31 , and so on . this is the discrete equivalent of the gauss law ensuring the @xmath19 gauge invariance .",
    "then the constraints @xmath13 $ ] impose further conditions on these @xmath5 variables .",
    "these equations are labeled by couples of triangles @xmath32 and we distinguish three different cases @xcite :    * @xmath33 : when @xmath34 , the associated bivector @xmath35 must be simple , @xmath36 . * @xmath37 : when @xmath21 and @xmath38 belong to the same tetrahedron , i.e. when they share a common edge , we also have @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the sum @xmath40 of the two bivectors is once again simple . *",
    "@xmath41 : when @xmath21 and @xmath38 only share a common vertex , they do nt belong to the same tetrahedron .",
    "the constraints impose that the quantity @xmath42 is , up to a sign , independent of the choice of such couple of triangles .",
    "it is actually equal to the 4-volume of the 4-simplex ( up to a factor 16/25 ) and the sign relates to the relative orientation of the triangles .",
    "the case @xmath33 is straightforward to deal with .",
    "the two remaining cases are the problematic ones .",
    "we naturally would like to interpret @xmath37 as the primary constraints and @xmath41 as the secondary constraints .",
    "assuming that @xmath37 holds on the initial hypersurface ( e.g. one tetrahedron of the 4-simplex ) and that @xmath41 are satisfied , then @xmath37 is also true on the final hypersurface ( e.g. all four remaining tetrahedra ) .",
    "this is easily proved using the closure condition to relate @xmath37 and @xmath41 .",
    "for instance , b_abb_bc + b_ac b_bc = -b_adb_bc -b_aeb_bc , where the subscripts @xmath43 are implicit .",
    "the left hand side corresponds to @xmath37 on the tetrahedra @xmath5 and @xmath44 while the right hand side relates to @xmath41 .",
    "we then repeat this procedure on all tetrahedra .",
    "this answers the question raised above : @xmath41 are the secondary constraints searched for : they involve the whole 4-simplex structure and ensure that the spatial constraints @xmath37 are satisfied under time evolution .    furthermore , using the same relations",
    ", we show that assuming @xmath37 holds for all tetrahedra of the 4-simplex implies that @xmath41 is true .",
    "this means that we only need to solve the constraints @xmath37 as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this is also the reason why the case @xmath41 is not discussed in the geometric characterization of 4-simplices in the original barrett - crane papers @xcite .    at the quantum level , we replace all the variables @xmath22 by the @xmath23 generators @xmath45",
    ". this does not change anything to the previous statements .",
    "the issue is that , although the constraints @xmath33 commute with each other , the constraints @xmath37 ( and @xmath41 ) do not . therefore looking for states that solve exactly all the constraints",
    "@xmath37 might lead to a very small hilbert space .",
    "indeed it gives the unique barrett - crane intertwiner .",
    "however this situation comes from the fact that these constraints are second class already at the classical level .",
    "this suggests a different approach : to weaken the constraints and look for coherent states that would only solve them in average with a minimal uncertainty @xcite .",
    "this should likely lead to states with a more straightforward geometrical interpretation and provide us with a larger hilbert space .",
    "in this section we construct a larger hilbert space , where the simplicity constraints hold in the expectation values .",
    "consider @xmath33 first . in terms of generators ,",
    "the constraint on a single triangle @xmath46 is a condition on the @xmath23 representation associated to @xmath21 . to understand this condition ,",
    "notice that @xmath47 is the second casimir operator of the @xmath23 lie algebra ; using the decomposition of @xmath23 in self - dual and anti - self - dual sectors , @xmath48 , it is the difference of the casimirs of the two @xmath49 sub - algebras : _",
    "ijklj_^ijj_^kl= ( ^+_)^2 -(^-_)^2=0 .",
    "this means that the @xmath23 representation @xmath50 associated to the triangle @xmath21 must carry the same spin on its self - dual and anti - self - dual part , @xmath51 .",
    "such a representation is called simple @xcite .",
    "next , consider @xmath37 , and notice that it involves two triangles on the same tetrahedron .",
    "we have four simple representations @xmath52 for the four triangles @xmath53 on the tetrahedron boundary .",
    "the closure condition @xmath54 means that we are restricted to @xmath23-invariant states in the tensor product @xmath55 , i.e. intertwiner states between these four representations .",
    "we use the standard recoupling basis of intertwiners ,    ( 0,0)(-85,25 ) ( -14,17 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 0,35 ) ( 45,0)(45,35 ) ( 10,10)(1,1)10(10,30)(1,-1)10 ( 35,20)(1,1)10(35,20)(1,-1)10 ( 20,20)(1,0)15(22,25 ) ( 20,20)(35,20 )    ( 0,0)(-150,25 ) ( -12,17)@xmath56 ( 0,0 ) ( 0,35 ) ( 45,0)(45,35 ) ( 10,10)(1,1)10(10,30)(1,-1)10 ( 35,20)(1,1)10(35,20)(1,-1)10 ( 20,20)(1,0)15(22,25 ) ( 20,20)(35,20 )    ( 0,0)(0,25 ) ( -10,0 ) ( -10,35 ) ( 30,0)(30,35 ) ( 10,10)(1,1)10(10,30)(1,-1)10 ( 35,20)(1,1)10(35,20)(1,-1)10 ( 20,20)(1,0)15 ( 20,20)(35,20 )    and we label @xmath57 the states in @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the simple representation @xmath52 , and @xmath60 is the label for the representation @xmath61 . in @xmath58",
    "we have three new independent simplicity conditions , @xmath62 for all couples of triangles @xmath63 .",
    "these constraints mean that the sum @xmath64 is required to remain simple .",
    "strongly imposing the simplicity conditions @xmath65 forces the recoupled representation to be simple , @xmath66 . further imposing @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "then leads to a single intertwiner @xcite .",
    "the key point is that these constraints do not commute with each other .",
    "for instance @xmath69 $ ] is still cubic in the @xmath70 s @xcite .",
    "thus , imposing these constraints strongly at the quantum level amounts to imposing a whole tower of constraints of higher and higher order in the @xmath70 s .",
    "it looks as if we are actually enforcing too many conditions , and we are indeed left with a one - dimensional intertwiner space ( once the @xmath71 s are given ) .",
    "we propose to weaken the constraints and look for intertwiner states @xmath72 that satisfy the simplicity conditions only in the expectation values , @xmath73 for all couples @xmath74 .",
    "for this purpose , we introduce the hilbert space of _ symmetric _ intertwiners , @xmath75 .",
    "these are defined as invariant under the exchange of @xmath76 and @xmath77 : [ 5 ] |=_(j_12^+,j_12 ^ - ) _",
    "j_12^+,j_12 ^ - |j_a , ( j_12^+,j_12 ^ - ) , with @xmath78 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this defines a hilbert space and that it is invariant under the choice of recoupling basis  in ( [ 5 ] ) we could have chosen the pairing 1 - 3 or 1 - 4 instead of 1 - 2 .",
    "it is also obvious that any state @xmath79 satisfies all the constraints @xmath80 in expectation value .",
    "we even have the stronger statement that @xmath75 is the largest hilbert space such that all the matrix elements of the constraints vanish : , ^sym_0,|_a , b|=0 . from this perspective",
    ", the operators @xmath80 can take us out of the hilbert space @xmath75 , but they actually vanish weakly if we restrict ourself to work only with states within @xmath75 .",
    "although @xmath76 and @xmath77 are not necessarily equal , the simplicity condition is guaranteed by the symmetry of the coefficients .    at the end of the day , we have shown that it is possible to consistently impose the intertwiner simplicity condition in a weaker sense .",
    "this leads a larger intertwiner space , thus a larger space of ( boundary ) spin networks for the spinfoam model . on this larger space",
    "the simplicity condition holds in average . in the next section ,",
    "we show how to impose the constraints with ( almost ) minimal uncertainty using the coherent intertwiners introduced in @xcite .",
    "this allows to recover the geometrical interpretation of intertwiners as quantum tetrahedra .",
    "let us start by considering a bivector @xmath35 associated to a single triangle .",
    "it is simple if and only if its self - dual and anti - self - dual parts have equal norms , @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the spatial part of the bivector .    the simpler case when @xmath84 means that the  time - like \" part of @xmath5 vanishes , @xmath85 , i.e the  time - like \" vector @xmath86 is orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "can nevertheless naturally be seen as the  time - like \" normal vector .",
    "this issue would be clearer in a lorentzian framework which we postponed for future investigation .",
    "] then the spatial part @xmath87 can always be expressed as the vector product of two 3-vectors @xmath88 and @xmath89 , @xmath90 . defining the 4-vectors @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    ", it is straightforward to check that @xmath93}$ ] , that is the bivector can be expressed as the wedge product of two vectors which are interpreted as a discretized tetrad field .    in the generic case ,",
    "if @xmath94 and @xmath95 have the same norm , there exists a @xmath96 rotation @xmath97 which maps one on the other , @xmath98 . introducing the @xmath19 rotation @xmath99 ( where the left side acts as @xmath100 and the right on @xmath101 ) , we define the rotated bivector @xmath102 . then @xmath103 has equal self - dual and anti - self - dual components and we can repeat the same analysis as above . in particular , we obtain that the 4-vector @xmath104 is the  time - like \" vector orthogonal to @xmath5 .",
    "we now discuss the implementation of this idea at the quantum level .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce a coherent state which is peaked on the classical value @xmath105 .",
    "such state is the tensor product of two @xmath106 coherent states for the self - dual and anti - self - dual components , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and the @xmath109 are unit 3-vector . satisfying the simplicity condition @xmath33 means choosing the same representation for both components , @xmath51 , which we denote simply as @xmath110 .",
    "the @xmath96 rotation @xmath97 between @xmath111 and @xmath112 defines the time - like normal to @xmath5 as discussed above .",
    "a tetrahedron is characterized by four bivectors @xmath113 , @xmath114 , each of which has associated a coherent state @xmath115 , satisfying the closure condition @xmath116 .",
    "a quantum state for the tetrahedron is then constructed by averaging over @xmath25 the tensor product of the four coherent states for each bivector : @xmath117 the @xmath25-averaging ensures the state is an intertwiner , so as to satisfy the closure constraint at the quantum level .",
    "we still have to solve the simplicity constraint .",
    "following an idea of @xcite , we implement them by requiring that all four bivectors @xmath5 lay in the same hypersurface : they must be normal to the same  time - like \" vector .",
    "this means that all four self - dual components @xmath118 must come from the same rotation of the four anti - self - dual components @xmath119 .",
    "thus , there must exist a single rotation @xmath120 independent from @xmath121 such that : a,^-_a = g^+_a . implementing this condition on the intertwiner state ,",
    "we are left with the quantum tetrahedron state : = dg _",
    "ag|j_a,^+_a , g^+_a .",
    "since the haar measure on @xmath25 is the product of the independent integrations over @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the rotation @xmath97 is irrelevant and @xmath72 is simply a tensor product state : = _ + _ + , _ + _",
    "( 2)dg_+ _ a g_+|j_a,^+_a , where @xmath122 is an @xmath106-intertwiner state .",
    "expressed as such , it is manifest that the state @xmath72 belongs to the hilbert space @xmath75 constructed above , and therefore solves the simplicity constraints weakly .    using the tensoring properties of the @xmath106 coherent states , we have @xmath123 , and thus we can simplify the formula above by doubling the spins @xmath59 : [ psi ] = dg _ ag|2j_a,^+_a .",
    "this shows that our states are the same ones as defined by engle , pereira and rovelli for their new spinfoam model @xcite .",
    "the states ( [ psi ] ) span a hilbert space of intertwiners which ( i ) is a subspace of @xmath75 and therefore weakly solves the simplicity constraints , and ( ii ) matches the engle - pereira - rovelli proposal .",
    "we have only expressed their intertwiner space in a different ( overcomplete ) basis using coherent states .",
    "since we use the same simple representations and same intertwiner spaces , we end up with the same spinfoam model as in @xcite , which has the same boundary hilbert space as loop quantum gravity .",
    "our 4-simplex amplitude is obtained by gluing five tetrahedron states together along ten triangles :  _ ^2 where @xmath124 and @xmath125 label the two tetrahedra to which the triangle @xmath21 belongs .",
    "notice that , since we use a different intertwiner basis , our 4-simplex amplitude is not expressed in term of @xmath126 s as in @xcite , although the whole spinfoam amplitude should ultimately be the same .",
    "the difference lays in the boundary data : our coherent spin network states carry more information and have a simpler semiclassical behavior for large spins .",
    "this is to be compared to coherent states for the harmonic oscillator which are labeled by two real numbers instead of a single integer but that admit a straightforward semiclassical interpretation .",
    "we expect this choice of basis to improve the geometrical interpretation of the model and the study of its semiclassical limit .",
    "in this final section , we comment on an alternative model that can be constructed , using a sign ambiguity present in our procedure .",
    "this is related to the existence of two sectors of the constrained bf theory , e.g. @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath127 is not the only classical solution of the simplicity constraints ( [ 2 ] ) , but also @xmath128}$ ] solves them .",
    "the first solution gives a sector that reproduces general relativity , while the second solution leads to a non - geometrical theory ( the tetrad @xmath12 is still required to be compatible with the connection , @xmath129 , but does not necessarily satisfy the einstein equations ) . of course , the goal is to build a spinfoam model representing the gravitational sector and not the non - physical one .",
    "this ambiguity is present in our framework , where it translates into a sign ambiguity . considering a single bivector @xmath5 satisfying the simplicity condition @xmath130",
    ", there exists a rotation @xmath120 such that @xmath131 as we considered , but we can also flip the sign and consider the other branch defined by @xmath132 .",
    "the first branch corresponds to bivectors which read @xmath133}$ ] while the second branch gives @xmath134 , where @xmath12 and @xmath135 are two 4-vectors .",
    "this flipping possibility clearly corresponds to the previous ambiguity .",
    "the point is that this sign ambiguity is due to the invariance of the quadratic simplicity constraints under the change @xmath136 .",
    "however , our way to implement the simplicity constraints on intertwiners is not invariant under the hodge operator @xmath137 and should in principle distinguish the two sectors .",
    "this should be a great improvement on previous spinfoam models .    at the quantum level , this means considering coherent states @xmath138 instead of @xmath139 . at the level of a single triangle",
    ", this does not make a difference since @xmath140 is as good a unit vector as @xmath141 in our riemannian setting ( in the lorentzian setting , the two branches can be distinguished , one vector belonging to the upper time - like unit hyperboloid and the other to the lower hyperboloid ) .",
    "nevertheless , using this choice to form tetrahedron states , we end up with a different class of intertwiners : & = & dg _",
    "ag|j_a,^+_a,-^+_a + & = & dg_+ _ a g_+|j_a,^+_adg_- _ a g_-|j_a,-^+_a . instead of tensoring the @xmath106 intertwiner with itself",
    ", we tensor it with its complex conjugate .",
    "it then leads to a slightly different 4-simplex amplitude where the coherent intertwiners labeling the anti - self - dual part are the dual of the self - dual part instead of being identical .",
    "the first proposal with matching self - dual and anti - self - dual intertwiners reproduces the model proposed by engle - pereira - rovelli @xcite while this second flipped model looks more like a coherent state version of the barrett - crane model ( which uses vanishing spin states of the @xmath142 type with conjugate self - dual and anti - self - dual components ) .",
    "the natural question is which of the two models correspond to the proper spinfoam quantization of general relativity , if any .",
    "now that all the foundations have been set and the simplicity constraints consistently implemented , the next step is to study the asymptotics of the new proposed spinfoam vertex and check that the graviton propagator ( e.g. @xcite ) is better behaved than for the barrett - crane model .",
    "notice that a calculation of the graviton tensorial structure will allow to discriminate between the two proposed models , with identical or conjugate intertwiners , and check which one has the right degrees of freedom .",
    "we would like to thank carlo rovelli , roberto pereira and jonathan engle for many useful discussions , especially on the sign ambiguity .",

    "<S> this leads to a larger hilbert space which will hopefully have a better - behaved semiclassical sector .    </S>",
    "<S> we will first review the structure of the discretized @xmath13 $ ] constraints in the spinfoam framework and show how they truly implement the second class constraints derived in the canonical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we then show how to impose them weakly at the quantum level and derive the new hilbert space of boundary states . </S>",
    "<S> we finally explain how to implement this idea using the coherent intertwiner states introduced in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a new proposal for a spinfoam model of quantum gravity .    </S>",
    "<S> we point out that we work in 4d riemannian gravity with spacetime signature @xmath18 and gauge group @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> even though some of the key ideas will extend directly to lorentzian signature and the non - compact group @xmath20 , we postpone a detailed discussion of this case for later work . </S>"
