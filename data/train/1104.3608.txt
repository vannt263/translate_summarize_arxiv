    "local galaxy clusters are characterised by populations of passive , early - type galaxies , whose properties contrast markedly with the star - forming , late - type galaxies found in the surrounding low - density field ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "* ) , in contrast to the field where most of the star - formation activity occurs at @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "hence the evolution of galaxies in clusters appears to be _ accelerated _ relative to that in low - density regions . as a result , while the average star - formation rate ( sfr ) of a galaxy _ decreases _ with increasing local galaxy density in the low - redshift universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this trend should reverse at earlier times : with the sfr _ increasing _ with increasing galaxy density .",
    "hence the progenitors of massive clusters at high - redshifts ( proto - clusters ) should be identifiable as over - densities of star - forming galaxies .",
    "if the growth of the galaxies is synchronised with that of their super - massive black holes , then populations of active galactic nuclei should also be located in these proto - clusters @xcite .    to identify proto - clusters , the most representative , but time - consuming , technique is to find significant redshift over - densities in large spectroscopic redshift surveys of star - forming galaxies .",
    "a quicker route is to perform such searches around luminous high - redshift sources , such as quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) or powerful high - redshift radio galaxies ( hzrgs ) , where the expectation is that the massive black holes in these galaxies will be hosted by correspondingly massive galaxies which will signpost over - dense regions at high redshifts .",
    "an even more efficient technique is to forego spectroscopy and instead search for concentrations of emission - line galaxies in narrow - band imaging surveys of these regions .    for target qsos or hzrgs at @xmath22",
    ", ly@xmath3 is redshifted into the optical and hence most of the narrow - band imaging surveys have targeted ly@xmath3 emission .",
    "however , ly@xmath3 is far from ideal as it is a resonance line and even a small amount of dust is enough to destroy the line , thus biasing searches against the dusty and perhaps most active galaxies in any structure .",
    "a better choice is to use h@xmath3 , which is less sensitive to dust and also a more accurate tracer of star formation .",
    "however , for galaxies at @xmath23 , h@xmath3 is redshifted into the near - infrared , and it is only through the recent development of panoramic , near - infrared imagers that narrow - band searches based on h@xmath3 have become possible ( * ? ? ?",
