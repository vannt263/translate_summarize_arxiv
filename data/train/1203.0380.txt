    "cooling of a nanomechanical resonator ( nmr ) to its quantum ground state is a field of interesting theoretical and experimental research owing to their potential applications in high - precision detection of mass  @xcite , mechanical displacement  @xcite , and quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "one of the conventional methods is the sideband cooling approach , based on which various cooling schemes have been put forward by coupling the resonator to a dissipative two - level system such as superconducting qubits  @xcite , nitrogen - vacancy defects in diamond  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite and suspended carbon nanotubes  @xcite . another method that could lead to an efficient cooling to the ground state involves the destructive quantum interference , i.e. the creation of a dark state that suppresses the carrier and blue sideband transitions .",
    "the method has inspired numerous cooling schemes for trapped ions such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) cooling  @xcite and stark - shift cooling  @xcite . besides these , combining the eit cooling scheme with stark - shift cooling scheme , a robust and fast laser cooling for trapped ions , atoms or cantilevers with closed interaction contour has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that cooling of a single nmr can be achieved via dynamical back action process or radiation pressure acting on the nmr  @xcite .",
    "there have recently been a number of theoretical studies of the transport properties of a triple quantum dot ( tqd ) system arranged in a triangular geometry  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that by tuning of the ac field frequency , the anti - resonant behaviour in the current occurs . as the result , the stationary current is found to be sensitive to a - b effect due to spin - blockade  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the role of the dark state has been considered with two of the dots weakly connected to external leads  @xcite .",
    "the results showed that the coupling between the dot electrons and the dissipative single - phonon mode can influence the transport properties of the system  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been found that the presence of the dark state could be important not only in the study of transport properties but also for the cooling of micromechanical or nanomechanical resonators . in particular , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently demonstrated that an nmr can be cooled to its ground state by coupling to the tqd system operating in the strong coulomb - blockade regime  @xcite .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the cooling schemes considered so far have been limited to the case of the strong coulomb - blockade regime , in which at most one electron is allowed in the cooling system at a given time .",
    "however , the strong coulomb - blockade situation may not always work since a slight change in the chemical potential of the electrodes could lead to the inclusion of two electrons into the transport window . with the possibility to inject two electrons",
    ", one can expect to see novel features in the electron transport and cooling properties of a given system .",
    "for example , pltl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that the presence of two electrons in the tqd system may lead to the creation  of a two - electron dark state , which could result in breaking of the transport current and the system then exhibiting super - poissonian behaviours  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study the cooling properties of the tqd system when two electrons could be present in the dot system .",
    "comparison is made with the single - electron cooling calculated by li _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that arises in the strong coulomb - blockade regime .",
    "we include charging potential energies to describe the inclusion of two electrons .",
    "following the prediction of pltl _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that under some circumstances a two - electron dark state can be created in the dot system , we demonstrate how the presence of this dark state could lead to cooling of the nmr to its ground state .",
    "we find that in both , the single and two - electron dark state cases , the tqd system may lead to cooling of the nmr only if there is an asymmetry present in the system .",
    "in particular , in the case of single electron injected to the dot system , a cooling of the nmr occurs only when the energy state of the quantum dot couple to the drain electrode is detuned from the energy states of the dots coupled to the electron source electrode . on the other hand , with two electrons present in the dot system , cooling of the nmr",
    "can be achieved even with identical quantum dots subject of an asymmetry between the charging potential energies coupling the injected electrons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sc2 ] we introduce the setup and explain the hamiltonian of the whole system , then we derive the master equation and the rate equations for the cooling dynamics .",
    "a detailed calculation of the conditions for cooling of an nmr with single- and two - electron dark states is presented in sec .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "finally , transformation matrices from the bare electron states to the dressed electron states are given in the appendix  [ app ] .",
    "a schematic diagram of the system we consider is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "three quantum dots , each composed of a single - electron orbital state , are arranged in a triangular geometry and are weakly connected to three fermionic electrodes via tunnel barriers .",
    "two dots , labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are capacitively coupled to each other without electrons tunnelling directly between them .     and @xmath1 are capacitively coupled to each other without electrons tunnelling directly between them while both dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled coherently to the dot @xmath2 with the tunnelling amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "a nanomechanical resonator ( nmr ) is capacitively coupled to the dots @xmath1 and @xmath2 only . ]",
    "the dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 are coupled to the dot  @xmath2 through the electron tunnelling effect that occurs with amplitudes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "thus , electrons can tunnel from the dot  @xmath0 to @xmath2 and from @xmath1 to  @xmath2 with no tunnelling permitted from the dots @xmath0 and  @xmath1 .",
    "the cross correlation between two capacitively coupled quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime has recently been measured  @xcite .",
    "we assume that only two quantum dots , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are directly coupled to the nmr .",
    "we can divide the hamiltonian of the entire system into four parts :  ( 1 ) three coupled quantum dots , ( 2 ) three normal metal electrodes coupled to the quantum dots , ( 3 ) a mechanical resonator interacting with two of the three quantum dots , and ( 4 ) a reservoir or thermal bath surrounding the mechanical resonator .",
    "the dynamics of the three coupled quantum dots containing maximum two electrons can be determined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a number operator describing the number of spin - up @xmath7 and spin - down @xmath8 electrons in the @xmath9th quantum dot .",
    "the operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of an electron with spin  @xmath12 in the @xmath9th quantum dot , and @xmath13 is the energy of the single - electron state in the dot @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that the energy states of the electron in each quantum dot are spin - independent , so both spin - up and spin - down electrons can equally occupy the energy states of the quantum dots .",
    "the coupling between the quantum dots is arranged through a tunnelling process such that the tunnelling of electrons between the dots @xmath0 and @xmath2 occurs with an amplitude @xmath3 , whereas between the dots @xmath1 and  @xmath2 occurs with an amplitude @xmath4 .",
    "there is no direct tunnelling allowed between the dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in this case , the system may be considered as a lambda - type system with two ground states @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the upper state @xmath2 .    a possibility of simultaneous injection of two electrons into the dots is determined in the hamiltonian ( [ hd ] ) by charging potential energies .",
    "there are two distinct types of the charging potential energies @xmath14 and @xmath15 , corresponding to the charging energy of two electrons injected to the same @xmath9th dot and to different dots , respectively .",
    "notice that the charging potential energies @xmath16 are independent of the polarization of the spins .",
    "the electrons can be injected to the quantum dots from normal metal electrodes by coupling them through a tunnelling process .",
    "suppose that the electrodes coupled to the dots @xmath0 and  @xmath1 appear as a source ( donors ) of the electrons while the electrode coupled to the dot @xmath2 appears as an absorber ( drain ) of the electrons . in this case , the hamiltonian of the electrodes coupled to the quantum dots can be written as @xmath17 , \\label{he}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the energy of the electrons with @xmath18 representing the energy of a single electron of wave number  @xmath19 in the electrode @xmath20 .",
    "the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are respectively the annihilation and creation operators of an electron with spin  @xmath12 and wave number  @xmath19 in the electrode @xmath20 . the second term in eq .",

    "the coupling is arranged through a tunnelling of the electrons between the electrodes and the quantum dots , and is independent of @xmath12 , so that both spin - up and spin - down electrons are coupled equally to the quantum dots .",
    "the capacitor adjacent to the dots is formed by the nmr and a static plate with a gate voltage applied to it .",
    "the effective capacitance of this capacitor could be adjusted by the displacement of the nmr from its equilibrium position  @xcite . in this way ,",
    "the displacement of the nmr couples to the number of electrons in the dots .",
    "we assume that only two of them , the dots @xmath1 and @xmath2 participate in the interaction with the nmr . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian of the nmr interacting with the quantum dots is of the form  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are operators representing the creation and annihilation of a phonon excitation of frequency @xmath27 in the  nmr , and @xmath28 is the electromechanical coupling constant between the @xmath9th quantum dot and the phonon mode .",
    "note that the interaction of the nmr with the dots is in a form of the nonlinear parametric interaction , known in optical systems as a radiation pressure type interaction  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the interaction with the quantum dots , the phonon mode of the nmr is also allowed to interact with a heat bath or thermal reservoir which results in the presence of thermal phonons in the nmr mode .",
    "the hamiltonian for this case is simply written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are respectively the creation and annihilation operators of the @xmath32th mode of frequency @xmath33 of the multi - mode reservoir , and @xmath34 is the coupling strength of the mode @xmath32 to the  nmr phonon mode @xmath26 .",
    "we should point out here that in the hamiltonians ( [ hd])-([hres ] ) the coupling parts retain only the terms which play a dominant role in the rotating - wave approximation .",
    "antiresonant terms which would make much smaller contributions have been omitted .",
    "the possibility of a simultaneous injection of two electrons to the quantum dots system can be directly addressed by writing the creation operators @xmath11 in the two - electron basis as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a product state of single electron states in which dots @xmath9 and  @xmath20 are occupied by an electron of spin @xmath37 .",
    "the state @xmath38 corresponds to the case of no electron occupying any of the quantum dots .",
    "the minus signs in the expressions arise from the anti - symmetric property of the fermion system with respect to the exchange of two electrons .",
    "we may then decompose the hamiltonian @xmath39 into one- and two - electron parts @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the energy of the quantum dot system containing only a single electron of spin @xmath12 , the hamiltonian  @xmath42 represents the case when two parallel - spin electrons are injected to the quantum dots , and @xmath43 represents the case of two opposite - spin electrons present in the quantum dot system .",
    "the single- and two - electron hamiltonians can be conveniently written in matrix forms .",
    "the space of the quantum dot system containing a single electron is spanned by three state vectors , @xmath44 , the space of the system containing two parallel - spin electrons is spanned by three state vectors , @xmath45 , and the space of the system containing two opposite - spin electrons is spanned by nine state vectors , @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the hamiltonian @xmath41 written in the single - spin basis is of the form @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are energy differences between the dot @xmath0 and the dots @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively , and a single energy factor @xmath58 , in which @xmath59 is the unit matrix , has been pulled out for the convenience of diagonalization of the hamiltonian and interpretation .",

    "the operator  @xmath80 represents the one - way tunnelling process of injection of electrons to the quantum dots @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the source electrodes with chemical potential @xmath81 , and the damping of the dot @xmath2 by the one - way electron tunnelling out to the drain electrode with chemical potential @xmath82 . the electrons tunnel into the dots  @xmath0 and  @xmath1 with rates @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , whereas they tunnel away from the dot @xmath2 with the rate @xmath85 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",

    "for these chemical potentials in the equilibrium reservoirs , the fermi distributions in the source and drain electrodes can well be approximated by @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "thus , in the infinite - bias limit of  @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the three tunnelling rates have the form @xmath92 which is assumed to be independent of the energy @xmath93 and spin  @xmath12 .      having derived the master equation for the nmr coupled to the quantum dots system , we now turn our attention to the derivation of a rate equation for the average phonon number in the resonator modes . in doing this",
    ", we will assume that the coupling between the quantum dots and the resonator is weak , @xmath94 .",
    "in such a case , we may use the second - order perturbation theory to eliminate the degrees of the freedom of the quantum dot system .",

    "we first briefly consider the cooling mechanism with a single - particle dark state  @xcite",
    ".      in the strong coulomb - blockade regime , at most one electron can tunnel into the quantum dot system . with only one electron present ,",
    "the quantum - dot system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath120 alone , eq .",

    "we may diagonalize the @xmath121 matrix appearing in eq .",

    "on calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix one can find that all of the eigenvalues are different from zero and the corresponding eigenvectors all involve the state @xmath122 .",
    "this indicates that in general no electron trapping ( dark ) state is created because the electron can escape from the dot  @xmath2 to the drain electrode .",
    "however , it is easily verified that in the limit of @xmath123 , the eigenvalues of the matrix are @xmath124 and the corresponding eigenvectors are of the form @xmath125 , and @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "we see that one of the eigenvalues @xmath128 is zero and the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath129 does not involve the state  @xmath122 .",
    "this shows that by choosing two pumped dots of the same energies , @xmath130 , we may achieve a dark state that is decoupled from the dot  @xmath2 .",
    "this statement remains true even if @xmath131 .",
    "note that the creation of the dark state is independent of the ratio @xmath132 .",
    "it is straightforward to see from eq .",
    "( [ dei ] ) that @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the state @xmath134 is shifted upwards from the dark state energy by the amount @xmath135 , whereas the state @xmath136 is shifted downwards from @xmath137 by the amount @xmath138 .",
    "hence , the electron will experience gain of its energy when making a transition from the dark state @xmath137 to the state  @xmath134 and absorption of the energy when making a transition from the dark state to the state @xmath136 .",
    "thus , cooling of the nmr is possible only when the electron interacting with the nmr makes transition to the upper state . when @xmath131 , i.e. all three dots are identical , the states @xmath134 and @xmath136 are then symmetrically located about the dark state @xmath137 . in this case",

    "the arrows indicate transitions from the dark state that are induced by the coupling of the dressed system to the nmr .",
    "we see that the dark state @xmath142 is strongly coupled to only four states of the dressed system , two upper and two lower energy states . thus , similar to the symmetric case both cooling and",
    "heating processes can occur . however , a notable distinction between the symmetric and antisymmetric cases is that in the asymmetric case the absorption and emission processes occur at different frequencies .",

    "( [ epcoupling3 ] ) that the absorption processes occur at frequency @xmath143 , whereas emission processes occur at @xmath144 .",

    "this is readily understood if one recalls that increasing of the escape rate of the electrons results in a shortening of the interaction time of the electrons with the nmr .",

    "the population state @xmath174 is coupled to the other state through the detuning @xmath187 . in the steady state @xmath188 with @xmath189 , the population can be completely transferred to the state @xmath173 .",
    "thus , the equations of motion ( [ equ39 ] ) clearly demonstrate that in the steady - state with @xmath189 , the state  @xmath173 becomes a trapping state .",
    "the expressions ( [ equ39 ] ) also show that the single electron states play the major role in the two electron cooling process .",
    "the dark state @xmath173 is populated with the rate @xmath190 from the single electron states @xmath184 and @xmath185 . when @xmath189 , no population can be transferred from the other two - electron states .",
    "we conclude this section by pointing out that the conditions predicted by fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for cooling of a nmr with the two - electron dark state may be met in the current experimental situations .",
    "the value of the tunnelling rate @xmath191 mhz used to generate fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] corresponds to the typical values occurring in electron transport experiments where the tunnelling rates ranging from 10 khz to 10 ghz were measured  @xcite .",
    "the predicted cooling of the nmr occurs at frequencies @xmath192 corresponding to the value of @xmath193 mhz , which appears to be practical  @xcite . note further that the expected cooling times @xmath194 correspond to that required for the mean phonon number to reach the steady - state , which according to eq .",
    "( [ dn ] ) are of the order of @xmath195 . with the parameter values of @xmath196 ,",
    "corresponding to a realistic quality factor @xmath197  @xcite , @xmath198 and @xmath199 , the cooling could be achieved at times @xmath200 s.    finally , interesting further generalizations of the results presented in this paper could include other configurations of the quantum dot system such us @xmath201-type or linear systems .",
    "it is also worth considering systems composed of a large number of regularly distributed quantum dots .",
    "we have studied the dark state cooling technique in a system composed of three coupled quantum dots interacting with an nmr .",
    "two cases of coupling of the nmr to single and two - electron dark states have been considered .",
    "cooling of the nmr to its ground state can occur in both cases . in the case of the interaction of the resonator with a single - electron dark state ,",
    "no cooling of the resonator occurs unless the quantum dots are not identical .",
    "the steady - state cooling is possible only if the energy state of the quantum dot coupled to the drain electrode is detuned from the energy states of the dots coupled to the electron source electrode . in the case of identical dots",
    "the cooling and heating processes were found to occur with the same amplitudes and at the same frequency .",
    "this results in no effective cooling of the nmr . when the dots are not identical , the phonon emission ( heating ) and phonon absorption ( cooling ) transitions occur at different frequencies giving rise to an effective cooling of the nmr .    in the case of the interaction of the nmr with the two - electron dark state",
    ", we have showed that an effective cooling can be achieved even with identical quantum dots subject of asymmetries only in the charging potential energies coupling the injected electrons . in the symmetric case",
    ", we have shown that the cooling and heating transitions occur with the same amplitudes and at the same frequencies .",
    "an asymmetry in the charging potential energies is found to lead to unequal shifts of the effective dressed states of the systems which results in the cooling and heating frequencies to become detuned from each other .",
    "this shows that the physics of the two - electron dark state cooling process is quite similar to that of the single - electron dark state cooling .",
    "however , there is an important difference that these two cooling processes occur at significantly different frequencies .",
    "this indicates that the frequency at which the resonator could be cooled to its ground state can be changed by switching from the one - electron to the two - electron coulomb blockade process .",
