    "during the last decade a lot of effort has been put into the understanding of string theory compactifications including background fluxes .",
    "especially supersymmetric settings are up to now well understood ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    nonetheless , in order to make contact to particle physics an important issue is how to incorporate supersymmetry breaking into string theory . for the heterotic string a popular mechanism is to achieve the breaking by gaugino condensation on a hidden gauge group @xcite . in the setting of type ii string theory",
    "there is also the possibility to induce susy breaking by the inclusion of background fluxes @xcite . in @xcite clear conditions where given which a non - supersymmetric type ii vacuum has to satisfy to be consistent .",
    "however , also in the heterotic case one can turn on non - trivial background fluxes and hence by duality arguments find consistent non - supersymmetric vacua @xcite .",
    "this leaves open the question if these vacua can be constructed directly from the ten - dimensional heterotic supergravity action , which we answered affirmatively in @xcite , using the techniques of @xcite .",
    "this article is a short review of this work .",
    "the bosonic action up to order @xmath1 of ten - dimensional @xmath2 heterotic supergravity is given by @xcite @xmath3~.\\ ] ] here @xmath4 is the scalar curvature of the ten - dimensional space , @xmath5 the dilaton , @xmath6 the gauge field strength and @xmath7 the curvature built from the torsionful connection @xmath8 the neveu  schwarz ( ns ) three - form flux @xmath9 satisfies then the bianchi identity ( bi ) with respect to @xmath7 @xmath10 combining the equations of motion for the metric and the dilaton one finds the modified einstein equation @xmath11=0\\ ] ]      in order to make contact to four - dimensional physics we choose our ten - dimensional space to be of the form @xmath12 .",
    "here , @xmath13 denotes a maximally symmetric space with cosmological constant @xmath14 , and @xmath15 a compact six - dimensional manifold equipped with an su@xmath16-structure @xcite , respectively .",
    "the ten - dimensional metric takes then the form @xmath17 where the warp factor @xmath18 , as well as the fields @xmath5 , @xmath9 , and @xmath6 , depend only on the internal space @xmath15 .",
    "this in turn implies that in the bi ( [ bi ] ) @xmath7 also reduces to its equivalent on @xmath15 .",
    "this ansatz alone has already far reaching consequences . restricting the indices @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( [ modeinst ] ) to @xmath13 one finds the equation @xmath21",
    "^ 2\\cr & & + 2(\\nabla_m\\nabla_n e^a)(\\nabla^m\\nabla^n e^a)+ ( \\iota_m h\\cdot \\iota_n h)\\ ,",
    "\\nabla^m e^a\\nabla^n e^a\\big\\}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can be solved iteratively in @xmath1 and yields that up to @xmath22 the cosmological constant vanishes and the warp factor is constant . since our analysis is valid only up to order @xmath0 we are allowed to consider @xmath13 as a minkowski space with constant warping .      to analyze the consequences of our compactification ansatz",
    "more deeply we will follow the approach of @xcite and consider an effective four - dimensional potential , from which the equations of motions for all fields can be derived .",
    "using the fact that d@xmath18 and @xmath14 have to be zero in our setting we can write the action as @xmath23 with @xmath24~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath25 denotes the ricci scalar of the internal manifold @xmath15 .",
    "the equation of motion of @xmath18 implies then that @xmath26 on - shell , which is also demanded by the fact that we consider four dimensional minkowski vacua .    in order to understand",
    "how supersymmetry breaking can be analyzed starting from this potential we make use of the fact that @xmath15 is an su@xmath16-structure manifold . in particular , as was shown in @xcite , given the su@xmath16-structure forms @xmath27 and @xmath28 the conditions for supersymmetry read    [ susycond ] @xmath29    these conditions can also be understood as calibration conditions on ns5-branes @xcite wrapping three- , four- , and two - cycles in @xmath15 respectively , and are hence perceived as domain walls , strings , and space - time filling gauge theories in four dimensions .    since @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "contain all information encoded in the metric of @xmath15 it is possible to rewrite the scalar curvature @xmath25 in terms of these forms @xcite @xmath30 ^ 2-\\frac{1}{2}|\\d \\omega|^2+\\frac{1}{2}|j\\wedge \\d\\omega|^2+\\frac{1}{2 } u^2-\\nabla^mu_m\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the one - form @xmath31 given by @xmath32 using this formula and the bi ( [ bi ] ) one can rearrange the potential ( [ firstpot ] ) such that it is written only in terms of squares . separating @xmath33 from @xmath1 terms",
    "one gets @xmath34 with    [ pot2 ] @xmath35 ^ 2\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{4}\\big[e^{2\\phi}\\d\\big(e^{-2\\phi}j\\wedge j \\big ) \\big]^2\\label{potord0}\\\\ + & \\frac{1}{4\\kappa^2}\\int \\text{vol}_m\\,e^{4a-2\\phi}\\big[|e^{2\\phi}\\d(e^{-2\\phi}\\omega)|^2-|j\\wedge e^{2\\phi}\\d(e^{-2\\phi}\\omega)|^2\\big]\\nonumber\\\\ - & \\frac{1}{4\\kappa^2}\\int \\text{vol}_m\\,e^{4a-2\\phi}\\big\\{\\frac1{4}e^{2\\phi}(j\\wedge j)\\lrcorner \\d(e^{-2\\phi}j\\wedge j)\\,+\\,\\frac{1}{2}e^{2\\phi}\\,\\text{re}[\\bar\\omega\\lrcorner \\d(e^{-2\\phi}\\omega)]\\big\\}^2\\nonumber\\\\ v_1= & \\frac{\\alpha^\\prime}{8\\kappa^2}\\int \\text{vol}_m e^{4a-2\\phi}\\big[2\\text{tr}\\ , |f^{2,0}|^2+\\text{tr}\\,|j\\cdot f^{1,1}|^2\\big ] -\\big[2\\text{tr}\\ , |r_+^{2,0}|^2+\\text{tr}\\,|j\\cdot r^{1,1}_+|^2\\big]~.   \\label{potord1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that all terms appearing at zeroth order in @xmath0 ( [ potord0 ] ) will vanish quadratically when the supersymmetry conditions ( [ susycond ] ) are implied . on the other hand",
    "the terms appearing in @xmath36 vanish quadratically if @xmath6 as well as @xmath7 are primitive @xmath37-forms , i.e. @xmath38 but , as was shown in @xcite , these equations are also implied by supersymmetry .",
    "thus we find that the effective potential of heterotic supergravity compactified on an su@xmath16-structure manifold can be put in a bps - like form , by which we mean that it and its variations vanish once supersymmetry is imposed . differently speaking ,",
    "we have shown that indeed supersymmetry and the bi are sufficient to satisfy the equations of motion . the next question to address",
    "is how this picture changes once supersymmetry is broken .",
    "in order to keep the effects of supersymmetry breaking tractable as well as controllable we will keep as much of the conditions of section [ susysection ] as possible .",
    "in fact we will allow that @xmath39 while we still demand the following conditions      this means that ns5-branes wrapping three - cycles of @xmath15 and hence appearing as domain - walls in @xmath13 are not any longer calibrated .",
    "thus this type of supersymmetry breaking was named _ domain - wall susy breaking _ in @xcite . in more geometric terms allowing ( [ dwsb ] ) means that @xmath15 is not any longer a complex manifold but only almost complex with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .      to analyze the implications of this ansatz",
    "we will focus first on @xmath41 , the @xmath33 part of the potential ( [ pot2 ] ) .",
    "first one should notice that the reasoning of section [ compansatz ] does not depend on any supersymmetry arguments .",
    "hence in particular @xmath18 is still constant and the potential should vanish on - shell . imposing the conditions ( [ dwsbcond ] ) we arrive at @xmath42~\\stackrel{!}{=}~0~ , \\label{potpiece}\\ ] ] which is equivalent to demanding latexmath:[\\[\\label{sbcond }    d@xmath27 and d@xmath28 in terms of torsion classes",
    "@xcite we find that ( [ dwsbcond ] ) implies @xmath44 and that the condition ( [ sbcond ] ) is satisfied if @xmath45 in ( [ potpiece ] ) do not vanish separately one also has to make sure that the equations of motion coming from this potential are indeed satisfied .",
    "defining a two form @xmath46 we find as an additional constraint @xmath47&= & 8g_{mn}|w_1|^2 - 2\\text{re}[\\bar w_1(\\iota_m w_2\\cdot \\iota_n j)]-\\text{re}[\\iota_{m}w_2\\,\\cdot\\,\\iota_{n}\\bar{w}_2]\\\\ & = & |w_1|^2\\big\\{9g_{mn}-\\text{re}\\big [ \\iota_m\\big(\\frac{w_2}{w_1}+j\\big)\\cdot\\iota_n\\big(\\frac{\\bar w_2}{\\bar w_1}+j\\big ) \\big]\\big\\}\\nonumber~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one should note that our susy breaking mechanism is governed by one scalar parameter , namely @xmath48 . since @xmath48 has mass dimension 1 we relate it to the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath49 and susy breaking effects remain small as long as @xmath48 is kept sufficiently small .    turning to @xmath36",
    "one finds that the conditions for its vanishing are the same as in the supersymmetric case ( [ primitivity ] ) .",
    "but only the primitivity of @xmath6 is still guaranteed , while @xmath7 could in principle be @xmath50 as well as non - primitive .",
    "nevertheless , for our analysis it suffices that @xmath51 and @xmath52 vanish at zeroth order in @xmath0 , since they appear only in the first order correction to the potential which is the highest order of correction that we study .",
    "a detailed analysis of the supersymmetry variation of the gravitino , as can be found in @xcite , shows then that @xmath7 is only then @xmath37 and primitive to a sufficient order in @xmath0 if the susy breaking scale @xmath53 is much smaller then the compactification scale @xmath54 @xmath55    to conclude , in order to have a consistent dwsb setting there are several condition to be met .",
    "first one has to make sure that the conditions ( [ finalcond1 ] ) and ( [ eomtor ] ) coming from the zeroth order part of the potential are satisfied .",
    "this should be possible by choosing a suitable manifold @xmath15 .",
    "then one has to make sure that the susy braking scale defined by @xmath48 is much smaller then the compactification scale while one still has to satisfy the bianchi identity ( [ bi ] ) .",
    "as is shown in more detail in @xcite these conditions can indeed be satisfied for elliptic fibrations of a warped k3 manifold , also analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the need to fulfill the bianchi identity and the quantization of the @xmath9-flux leads then to a stabilization of the dilaton @xmath5 and the volume of the elliptic fiber .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the gravitino mass is inverse proportional to the volume of k3 and hence that supersymmetry breaking is weak for k3 sufficiently large .",
