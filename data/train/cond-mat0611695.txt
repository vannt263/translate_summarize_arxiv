    "in a class of quantum critical points ( qcp ) , lorentz invariance appears as an emergent symmetry , but in general the quasiparticle residue , as inferred from the one - particle green s function may vanish . in rare cases , when the quasiparticle residue is finite , depending on the statistics of the excitations , the lorentz invariant qcp is described by either a relativistic massless bosonic free field theory ( massless klein gordon action ) or a relativistic massless fermionic free field theory ( massless dirac action ) . only in ( 1 + 1)-dimension are both descriptions identical due to transmutation of statistics .",
    "though the theory has a relativistic form , the speed of excitations is usually about two orders of magnitude smaller than the physical speed of light . due to fluctuations on",
    "all length scales in a critical system , many physical quantities exhibit power laws and obey scaling in the vicinity of the qcp . even in the simplest of such systems , there are surprises buried in their diamagnetic response because a magnetic field is never a small perturbation : any perturbation that changes the spectra from continuous to discrete can not be considered small . here",
    ", we hope to elaborate on this topic and present estimates that may be tested in experiments .    for a class of tight binding models in the half filled limit , for example graphite or graphene",
    ", the energy vanishes at distinct points of the brillouin zone known as the nodal points ,  @xcite and in the long wavelength and low frequency limit the dynamics are well described by dirac fermions obtained by linearizing the spectrum around the nodes .",
    "the nodal spectra can also arise from a condensate .",
    "an example is nodal fermionic quasiparticles of a particle - hole condensate in @xmath8 angular momentum channel , as in a singlet @xmath4-density wave ( ddw ) , staggered flux phase , or an orbital antiferromagnet .",
    "@xcite    the electromagnetic charge is a conserved quantity for a tight binding model of an electron .",
    "this is also true if the order parameter is a particle - hole condensate , as in a ddw . in these cases ,",
    "the electromagnetic field can be incorporated via the minimal gauge coupling .",
    "we shall restict ourselves to such systems and not consider nodal bogoliubov quasiparticles of a @xmath4-wave superconductor .",
    "the contrasting response of @xmath4-wave superconductor ( dsc ) and ddw is evident .",
    "@xcite the quasiparticles in a superconductor do not minimally couple to the vector potential @xmath9 , but to the supercurrent @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the phase of the superconducting order parameter , @xmath12 is the electronic charge , and @xmath13 is the velocity of light .",
    "the effect of the chemical potential , @xmath14 , is extremely important , as it can introduce electron or hole pockets and render the linearized free dirac theory invalid .",
    "however , for small @xmath14 one can still use the linearized continuum theory ; @xmath15 describes the vaccum of the relativistic massless theory and hence is critical .",
    "but , for a finite @xmath14 , one is dealing with a finite density of excitations .",
    "thus , one is perturbed away from the criticality , and this should provide a cutoff .    for the diamagnetic response at @xmath15 and zero temperature ( @xmath16 ) , one can use a simple quantum critical scaling analysis to find the power laws satisfied by the magnetization and the susceptibility .",
    "@xcite in this paragraph we shall set @xmath17 . from gauge invariance , the vector potential @xmath18 has the same scaling dimension as the momentum which is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a length .",
    "therefore the magnetic field @xmath21 has the scaling dimension @xmath22 or there is a length scale @xmath23 .",
    "one can immediately see that this length , which acts as a cutoff at the quantum critical point of the free dirac fermions , is proportional to the landau length . since the hyperscaling should be valid for @xmath24 and the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 ,",
    "the singular part of the ground state energy density , @xmath25 , multiplied by the correlation volume , @xmath26 , should be a universal number ,  @xcite that is , @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the magnetization behaves as @xmath28 and the diamagnetic susceptibility behaves as @xmath29 . in the @xmath30 limit , @xmath1 diverges , which will be cut off by a number of physical effects not contained in this argument , and the stability of the state may not be in question .    the diamagnetic sign can not be obtained from the scaling argument . the energy levels in a magnetic field",
    "are bunched ( discrete spectra ) although the mean density of states is unchanged .",
    "the number of quasiparticles that can be accommodated below any given energy depends on whether or not this energy coincides with an eigenvalue of the landau spectrum or falls in between two eigenvalues . for the nonrelativistic case it is easy to see that on average the energy is increased , because near @xmath31 we always start with an empty interval . for the relativistic continuum theory of nodal fermions where we have to impose an ultraviolet cutoff ,",
    "this is subtle and requires a proper regularization . using the work of many authors involving @xmath32-function regularization ,",
    "@xcite we can show that the answers are indeed cutoff independent and the energy is increased .",
    "this was also checked by considering a lattice version and peierls substitution to incorporate the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    we can not apply the same scaling argument to free dirac fermions in @xmath33-dimensions because hyperscaling is violated .",
    "this case is best described by a mean field theory with logarithmic corrections .",
    "it is known from explicit calculations that the singular part of the ground state energy density @xmath34 .",
    "@xcite a naive application of the above scaling argument gives only a regular contribution , @xmath35 , which is not surprising .",
    "thus , we feel confident that the quantum critical scaling analyses are indeed meaningful .",
    "consider @xmath24 ; some aspects of the finite temperature and finite chemical potential results can be understood from the notion of quantum criticality . from finite size",
    "scaling , the correlation length , @xmath36 , is proportional to the thermal wave length , @xmath37 that is , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a universal number of the order of unity and @xmath5 is the fermi velocity . tuned to @xmath15 , the quantum criticality will persist until @xmath36 is the order of the lattice spacing @xmath40 . since @xmath5 is large , one would naively expect the singular diamagnetic susceptibility @xmath41 to persist over a wide temperature range .",
    "in fact , @xmath1 is governed by a balance between two length scales : the landau length , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . if @xmath44 , then @xmath1 follows the power law indicating the quantum critical behavior , and in the opposite limit we obtain linear response , @xmath45 . at @xmath16 ,",
    "non - zero @xmath14 tunes the system away from criticality . for small",
    "@xmath14 one can still use the linearized spectrum , and this introduces another length scale , which is essentially the interparticle spacing @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    ", @xmath1 follows a power law and in the opposite limit @xmath48 .",
    "quantum criticality of relativistic fermions is experimentally relevant for graphene for which a linear spectrum has been established experimentally .",
    "@xcite these quasiparticles are charged fermions and show anomalous integer quantum hall effect , as well as shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "@xcite it is then natural to expect that , as @xmath49 , graphene should have the signature of a diamagnetic `` instability '' consistent with quantum criticality described above .",
    "similarly , the diamagnetic susceptibility of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) for which the linear dispersion of the fermionic excitations is known to be present  @xcite remains unexplored .",
    "this should be approximately describable in terms of a @xmath50-dimensional dirac theory with weak interlayer coupling .",
    "@xcite as mentioned above , it has been suggested that the pseudogap phase of the high @xmath51 superconductors can be described by ddw , whose quasiparticle excitations for @xmath15 are dirac fermions , as was recognized a long ago .",
    "@xcite our work is an extension of these early analyses of diamagnetism of nodal fermions to finite temperatures and finite chemical potential , which leads to interesting results .    in a set of magnetization measurements ,",
    "ong and his collaborators  @xcite have uncovered unusual diamagnetism in the pseudogap state of the high temperature superconductor @xmath52 ( bscco ) . in the pseudogap regime , above the superconducting transition temperature , the diamagnetic susceptibility diverges as @xmath53 , where the effective exponent @xmath54 is greater than unity over a very broad range of temperature .",
    "such a divergent susceptibility above a phase transition calls for new ideas , because the response in general should be linear . only at a critical point , where there are fluctuations on all scales ,",
    "is it possible to obtain such a nonlinearity .",
    "in particular , it is known that for two - dimensional kosterlitz - thouless theory @xmath55 at criticality ,  @xcite @xmath56 , but the response is linear for any temperature @xmath57 . to the extent that the critical region is sufficiently wide , it is of course possible to obtain a large value of susceptibility , but not a divergent susceptibility , as seen in measurements where fields as small as 5 gauss were used .",
    "taken at its face value , experiments indicate a critical phase extending over a wide region of the pseudogap state .    long ago it was suggested that a weakly coupled stack of @xmath58-systems could exhibit a floating phase in which the three - dimensional behavior at low temperatures converts to a floating power - law phase ( a stack of decoupled layers ) at intermediate temperatures and finally to the disordered phase at high temperatures.@xcite it is now rigorously known  @xcite that if the coupling between the layers is josephson - like ( a likely scenario ) , a floating phase is ruled out even for arbitrarily long - range couplings . very special , finely tuned , interlayer couplings are necessary to produce a floating phase , which appears to be unlikely .",
    "although we find that a sizable diamagnetism sets in with the ddw gap over and above the conduction electron diamagnetism , our results can not explain the data of ong and his coworkers : ( a ) there is no finite temperature critical phase ; ( b ) the relevant scales are vastly different . as mentioned above , kosterlitz - thouless theory can not account for a critical phase above @xmath59 , though the order of magnitude is reasonably close .",
    "@xcite we hope that our calculated crossover behavior of the diamagnetic response will be observable , at least in graphene or in @xmath2 .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "ii we will describe the effective model for nodal fermions in two dimensions and outline the formalism for computing the grand thermodynamic potential . in sec .",
    "iii we will describe our results for two dimensions ( @xmath60 ) .",

    "there are two appendices that contain certain mathematical details .",
    "when linearized about the two inequivalent vertices of the brillouin zone , the tight binding hamiltonian , @xmath21 , defined on a honeycomb lattice of a sheet of graphene involving only nearest neighbor hopping , with matrix element @xmath63 , becomes in the continuum limit ( lattice spacing @xmath64 such that @xmath65 is finite )    @xmath66\\psi_{s1 } \\nonumber \\\\     &   & + \\hbar v_{f}\\int \\frac{d^{2}k}{(2\\pi)^{2 } } \\psi_{2}^{s\\dagger}[k_{x}\\sigma_{2}+k_{y}\\sigma_{1}]\\psi_{s2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are two species of two - component dirac fermions corresponding to two inequivalent nodes , and @xmath69 is the fermi velocity ; the spin index @xmath70 is summed over .",
