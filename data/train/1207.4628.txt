    "the single - objective long path problem @xcite has been introduced to show that a problem instance can be difficult to solve for a hillclimber - like heuristic even if the search space is unimodal , _",
    "i.e. _ the single local optimum is the global optimum .",
    "for such a problem , a hillclimber guarantees to reach the global optimum , but the length of the path to get it is exponential in the dimension of the search space . as a consequence",
    ", a hillclimbing - based heuristic can not expect to solve the problem in polynomial time .",
    "the ` path length ' takes then place in the rank of problem difficulty , on the same level as multimodality , ruggedness , deceptivity , and so on .",
    "rudolph @xcite demonstrated that the long path problem can be solved in a polynomial expected amount of time for a @xmath0  evolutionary algorithm  ( ea ) which is able to mutate more than one bit at a time .",
    "this @xmath0 ea is able to take some shortcuts on the outside of the path so that it makes the computation more efficient .",
    "however , it does not change the argument that , even for unimodal problems , the path length to the global optimum must be taken into account in the design of efficient local search algorithms .",
    "like in single - objective optimization , the structure of the search space can explain the difficulty for multiobjective local search methods . in multiobjective combinatorial optimization ( moco ) , the efficient set is the set of solutions which are not dominated by any other feasible solution .",
    "it is often claimed that the structure of this efficient set plays a crucial role for the development of efficient local search methods @xcite .",
    "connectedness is related to the property that efficient solutions are connected ( at distance @xmath1 ) with respect to a neighborhood relation @xcite .",
    "this property has later been extended to the notion of cluster , where distances can take higher values @xcite .",
    "when connectedness holds , it becomes possible to find all the efficient solutions by means of the iterative exploration of the neighborhood of the current approximation set by starting by one ( or more ) solution(s ) from the efficient set .",
    "this strategy coincides with the pareto local search ( pls ) algorithm @xcite , initialized with one efficient solution , and then acts like an exact approach .",
    "however , a common knowledge is that , for most moco problems , the number of non - dominated solutions is not polynomial in the size of the problem instance  @xcite , so that a pls algorithm can take an exponential time to identify the efficient set once the later contains an exponential number of solutions .",
    "then , the goal of the optimization process is often to identify a representative sample set , containing a limited number of efficient solutions .    in this work",
    ", we argue that connectedness is not the only feature which explains the difficulty of moco for search algorithms .",
    "analogously to the single - objective long path problems , where a hillclimbing algorithm is outperformed by a simple ea , even if the search space is unimodal , we here oppose straightforward extensions of those algorithms , a hillclimbing algorithm and a simple ea , in a multiobjective context .",
    "on one side , pls extends a single - objective hillclimber in terms of pareto dominance @xcite . at the opposite",
    ", we use an adaptation of the simple evolutionary multiobjective optimization ( semo ) algorithm  @xcite . both approaches",
    "are initialized with one solution from the efficient set , corresponding to an extreme point of the pareto front . in this paper",
    ", we propose the definition of the biobjective long path problem ( @xmath2-lp@xmath3 ) and of the biobjective multiple path problem ( @xmath2-mp@xmath3 ) . with @xmath2-lp@xmath3 , we show experimentally that , even if the efficient set is connected , the runtime required by pls to find a reasonably good approximation ( in terms of hypervolume  @xcite ) is larger than for semo , and becomes computationally prohibitive for large - size instances .",
    "furthermore , we construct @xmath2-mp@xmath3  instances where the efficient set is completely disconnected , but some additional shortcuts are available to walk from one non - dominated solution to the others . in this case , we show experimentally that pls can find a good approximation in a significantly less amount of time than semo . indeed ,",
    "both algorithms differ in the way they sample the efficient set . for @xmath2-lp@xmath3 , pls can only follow the path defined by the connectedness property while semo is able to take some shortcuts outside of the path . for @xmath2-mp@xmath3 , pls takes advantage of the multiple paths , defined outside the efficient set , which are temporally non - dominated and that lead to further non - dominated solutions .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , some notions related to moco , connectedness and long path problems are briefly presented in the next section .",
    "section  [ sec : longpath ] introduces the class of biobjective long path problems , for which the efficient set is fully connected and exponential in the size of the problem instance .",
    "next , the class of multiple path problems is presented in section  [ sec : multiple ] .",
    "it handles an exponential number of disconnected efficient solutions .",
    "our experiments illustrate that pls appears to be outperformed by semo for biobjective long path problems , while more surprisingly , the opposite occurs for multiple path problems .",
    "this work leads to further investigations on a proper definition of fitness landscapes for moco , not only with regards to the efficient set itself , but also to the way that leads to its approximation .",
    "a multiobjective optimization problem can be defined by a set of @xmath4 objective functions @xmath5 , and a set @xmath6 of feasible solutions in the _ decision space_. in the combinatorial case , @xmath6 is a discrete set .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the set of feasible outcome vectors in the _ objective space_. to each solution @xmath8 is assigned an objective vector on the basis of a vector function @xmath9 with @xmath10 . without loss of generality",
    ", we here assume that all @xmath11 objective functions are to be maximized . a solution @xmath8 is said to _ dominate _ a solution @xmath12 , denoted by @xmath13 , iff @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 such as @xmath17 .",
    "a solution @xmath8 is said to be _ efficient _ ( or _ pareto optimal _ , _ non - dominated _ ) if there does not exist any other solution @xmath18 such that @xmath19 dominates @xmath20 .",
    "the set of all efficient solutions is called the _ efficient set _ and its mapping in the objective space is called the _ pareto front_. a possible approach in moco is to find a minimal set of efficient solutions , such that strictly one solution maps to each non - dominated vector .",
    "however , generating the entire efficient set of a moco problem is usually infeasible for two main reasons .",
    "first , the number of efficient solutions is typically exponential in the size of the problem instance @xcite . in that sense",
    ", most moco problems are said to be intractable .",
    "second , deciding if a feasible solution belongs to the efficient set is known to be np - complete for numerous moco problems  @xcite , even if none of its single - objective counterpart is np - hard . therefore , the overall goal is often to identify a good efficient set approximation , ideally a subpart of the efficient  set . to this end",
    ", heuristic approaches have received a growing interest in the last decades .",
    "a _ neighborhood structure _ is a function @xmath21 that assigns a set of solutions @xmath22 to any solution @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath23 is called the _ neighborhood _ of @xmath20 , and a solution @xmath24 is called a _ neighbor _ of @xmath20 . local search algorithms for moco , like the pareto local search ( pls ) @xcite , generally combine the use of such a neighborhood structure with the management of an archive ( or population ) of mutually non - dominated solutions found so far .",
    "the basic idea is to iteratively improve this archive by exploring the neighborhood of its own content until no further improvement is possible , or until another stopping condition is fulfilled .",
    "recently , local search approaches have been successfully applied to moco problems .",
    "some structural properties of the landscape seem to allow the search space to be explored in an effective way .",
    "such a property , related to the efficient set , is _ connectedness _  @xcite . as argued by the original authors",
    ", it could provide a theoretical justification for the design of multiobjective local search .",
    "let us define a graph such that each node represents an efficient solution , and an edge connects a pair of nodes if the corresponding solutions are neighbors with respect to a given neighborhood relation @xcite .",
    "the efficient set is said to be _ connected _ if there exists a path between every pair of nodes in the graph .",
    "paquete and sttzle @xcite extended this notion by introducing an arbitrary distance separating two efficient solutions ( _ i.e. _ the minimal number of neighbors to visit to go from one solution to another ) .",
    "unfortunately , in the general case , rather negative results have been reported in the literature for some classical moco problems @xcite . however , in practice , many empirical results show that efficient solutions for some moco problems are strongly clustered with respect to more classical neighborhood structures from combinatorial optimization , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the case of connectedness , by starting with one or more non - dominated solutions , it becomes possible to find all the efficient solutions through a basic iterative neighborhood exploration procedure , like pls .",
    "however , we show in this paper that connectedness is not the only property to deal with when searching for an approximation of the efficient set .",

    ", a shortcut can be found by flipping @xmath2 consecutive bits .",
    "for a hillclimbing algorithm which chooses the best solution in the neighborhood defined by hamming distance  @xmath1 , the number of iterations to reach the global optimum matches the length of the path , @xmath37 .",

    "it is also possible to extend the biobjective path problems proposed in this paper to a larger objective space dimension ( more than @xmath41 objective functions ) , or with a larger ` disconnectedness ' ( delete more than one solution over two ) .",
    "the next challenge will be to define a relevant definition of fitness landscape in order to better understand the difficulty of multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "given that the goal is here to find a set of solutions , we believe that another way to do so would be to analyze a fitness landscape where the search space consists of sets of solutions .",
    "a solution would then be a set of bit strings instead of a single bit string for the problems under study in this paper .",

    "<S> , we propose the biobjective long and multiple path problems . </S>",
    "<S> we show experimentally that , on the first problem , even if the efficient set is connected , a local search may be outperformed by a simple evolutionary algorithm in the sampling of the efficient set . at the opposite , on the second problem , a local search algorithm may successfully approximate a disconnected efficient set . </S>",
    "<S> then , we argue that connectedness is not the single property to study for the design of multiobjective local search algorithms . </S>",
