    "the abc effect  first observed by abashian , booth and crowe @xcite in the double pionic fusion of deuterons and protons to @xmath1he",
    " stands for an unexpected enhancement at low masses in the spectrum of the invariant @xmath0-mass @xmath7 .",
    "follow - up experiments @xcite revealed this effect to be of isoscalar nature and to show up in cases , when the two - pion production process leads to a bound nuclear system . with the exception of low - statistics bubble - chamber measurements @xcite all experiments conducted on this issue",
    "have been inclusive measurements carried out preferentially with single - arm magnetic spectrographs for the detection of the fused nuclei .",
    "initially the low - mass enhancement had been interpreted as due to an unusually large @xmath0 scattering length and as evidence for the @xmath2 meson , respectively @xcite .",
    "since the effect showed up particularily clearly at beam energies corresponding to the excitation of two @xmath8s in the nuclear system , the abc effect was interpreted lateron by a @xmath3 excitation in the course of the reaction process leading to both a low - mass and a high - mass enhancement in isoscalar @xmath7 spectra @xcite .",
    "in fact , the missing momentum spectra from inclusive measurements have been in support of such predictions .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that these structures can be enhanced considerably in theoretical calculations by including @xmath9 exchange and short - range correlations .",
    "in order to shed more light on this issue , exclusive measurements of the reactions @xmath10 ( @xmath11 = 1.03 and 1.35 gev ) and @xmath12he@xmath0 ( @xmath11 = 0.893 gev ) have been carried out in the energy region of the abc effect at celsius using the 4@xmath13 wasa detector setup with pellet target system @xcite .",
    "the selected energies have been close to the maximum of the abc effect observed in the respective inclusive measurements .",
    "the @xmath14 reaction proceeds as quasifree @xmath15 reaction with a spectator proton of very small momentum in the lab system .",
    "since all ejectiles with the exception of the spectator have been measured , the spectator momentum has been reconstructed by kinematical fits with three overconstraints .",
    "preliminary results for the reaction can be found in recent conference proceedings @xcite .",
    "the experimental results on the @xmath16he@xmath17 and @xmath12he@xmath18 reactions have been published already in ref .",
    "some specific results of the celsius - wasa measurements are shown in figs . 1 and 2 for the double - pionic fusion to the deuteron , which is the most basic reaction for studying the abc - effect .",
    "1 depicts the spectra of the invariant masses @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the quasifree @xmath15 reaction at the beam energy @xmath11 = 1.03 gev .",
    "the @xmath17 channel , which is free of any isospin i=1 contributions , exhibits a pronounced low - mass enhancement ( abc effect ) in the @xmath19 spectrum both in the fusion process to the deuteron and in the one leading to @xmath1he@xcite .",
    "we note that in the @xmath1he@xmath18 channel the threshold enhancement is observed @xcite too , however , less pronounced .",
    "the reason for this is that this channel in addition contains isovector contributions - as may be seen @xcite by the small shifts between the @xmath8 peaks in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 spectra ",
    "@xcite . however , the main result of these measurements is that indeed two @xmath8s are excited simultaneously in this reaction  in support of the hypothesis that a @xmath3 system is excited in the course of the double pionic fusion process .     and",

    "@xcite ) . , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    [ fig2 ]    from the measured angular distributions @xcite we find the following features :    * the pion angular distribution in the @xmath0 subsystem is flat for the low - mass enhancement region in the @xmath7 spectrum , i.e. , the abc - effect is of scalar - isoscalar nature  in other words it is a @xmath2 channel phenomenon . *",
    "the distribution of the opening angle between the two pions shows that the abc - effect is associated with two pions leaving the interaction vertex in parallel . *",
    "the angular distribution of the @xmath0 system ( which is aquivalent to the angular distribution of the residual nucleus ) in the overall center - of - mass system is not flat .",
    "it rather corresponds to a double p - wave distribution as expected from the decay of the @xmath3 system .    .",
    "from the measurements of the quasifree @xmath25 reaction at various energies we notice that the differential distributions do not change in shape significantly with energy .",
    "this points to the dominance of a single partial wave in the entrance channel , as is the case for the excitation of a s - channel resonance . as a consequence of such an assumption we should find a resonance - like energy dependence in the total cross section",
    "actually this is what in fact is observed for this reaction . in fig .",
    "2 we show the energy dependence of the total cross section of the double - pionic fusion to the deuteron . depicted are the results for the @xmath26 reaction from bubble chamber measurements at desy @xcite and jinr @xcite together with the preliminary celsius - wasa results @xcite for the quasifree @xmath25 reaction at two incident energies , which have been binned into narrow ranges of effective collision energy providing thus four entries below and two entries above the peak energy . since @xmath18 and @xmath17 channels are related by an isospin factor of two , the @xmath17 results are plotted in fig . 2 multiplied by this isospin factor",
    ". a resonance - like behavior of the total cross section is obvious .",
    "the @xmath0 low - mass enhancements observed in the exclusive data for the @xmath17 channels turn out to be much larger than predicted in previous @xmath3 calculations@xcite . as an example we show by the dashed lines in fig.1 and by dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 calculations in the model ansatz of ref .",
    "@xcite , where we additionally included the pion angular distribution in @xmath8 decay and the fermi smearing of the nucleons bound in the final nucleus .",
    "contrary to these predictions the data also do not exhibit any high - mass enhancement in @xmath19 that had been supported by the inclusive measurements , too . as suspected already in ref .",
    "@xcite the high - mass bump observed in inclusive spectra rather turns out to be associated with @xmath27 and @xmath28 production as well as with i=1 contributions . since on the one hand the available @xmath3 calculations obviously fail , but on the other hand the data clearly show the @xmath3 excitation in the @xmath29 spectra , a profound physics piece appears to be missing .",
    "such a missing piece may be provided by a strong @xmath3 attraction or even a boundstate formation , as was demonstrated in refs.@xcite .",

    "scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the essential clue to the nature of the abc effect appears to be in the intriguing energy dependence of the double - pionic fusion in the isoscalar channel .",
    "we note that the isovector fusion channel @xmath30 , shows *",
    "no * abc effect @xcite despite a clear @xmath3 excitation signal in its differential spectra .",
    "it also exhibits an energy dependence @xcite in its total cross section , which is close to the dotted curve in fig .",
    "2 . in contrast the isoscalar fusion channel exhibits a much more pronounced energy - dependence in accordance with a resonance excitation having a width of roughly 100 mev or even less , i.e. much smaller than twice the @xmath8 width expected from usual @xmath3 calculations . as also borne out by the data in fig .",
    "2 the cross section maximum at @xmath31 2.4 gev means that the resonance mass is below twice the @xmath8 mass , i.e. a quasibound state in the isoscalar @xmath3 system , which not only can decay into the @xmath4 system , but also into the isoscalar @xmath32 system , because the @xmath8 decay width is larger than the binding of this state .    in fact , if we use a breit - wigner term with a @xmath33 dependent width and adjust the width parameters not to fit the total cross section data , but to reproduce the abc - effect in the @xmath19 spectra , then we obtain not only a quantitative description of all differential data ( see , e. g. , solid curves in fig .",
    "1 ) but at the same time also a quantitative description of the energy dependence of the total cross section ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "2)thus obtaining automatically the observed width of the total cross section data .    before proceeding here any further",
    ", we would like to discuss the experimentally necessary conditions to establish a s - channel resonance . in case of a two - body reaction these",
    "may be given easily as follows :    * a resonance must be governed by a single partial wave and * this partial wave must exhibit a resonant behavior in its real and imaginary amplitude parts leading to a pronounced looping in the argand plot of this particular partial wave .    that way and by detailed partial wave analyses also resonances can be sensed , which in the observables are not seen directly , because they are burried underneath a background of other processes .",
    "even in the case that a single partial wave contains also a lot of nonresonant contributions , a pole search in the complex plane of the partial - wave amplitude as well as an argand plot can reveal hidden resonances  as is well known , e. g. , from the study of the roper resonance @xcite .",
    "if in a particular reaction excitation and decay of a resonance is the dominating process over a sufficiently large energy region , then the situation is much simpler :    * the total cross section must exhibit a breit - wigner like energy dependence and * the angular distibution has to keep the same shape over the region of the resonance ( `` frozen distribution '' ) being symmetric about 90@xmath34 in the center - of - mass system .      in order to examine this situation on an example close to our problem , we reinvestigate the situation of @xmath6 resonances , which show up both in elastic pp and @xmath35 scattering , and , in particular , in the @xmath36 reaction , which also has been measured over a wide energy range @xcite . for all three reaction channels",
    "there are ample data in the region of interest . also there exist detailed partial wave analyses for each of these reaction channels separately @xcite as well as combined analyses @xcite . whereas elastic nn scattering couples to many channels and hence is quite insensitive to particular resonance states , elastic @xmath35 scattering and especially the reaction @xmath37 select specifically single @xmath8 excitations in two - body processes .",
    "the latter reaction has been investigated intensively at the pion factories lampf , triumf and psi via the reversed reaction @xmath38 .    the data for the @xmath37 reaction exhibit an energy dependence of the total cross section , which is in very close correspondence to a breit - wigner resonance peaking at @xmath39 550 mev and sitting on a very low background at higher energies .",
    "in addition the angular distibution , which has a @xmath40 dependence ",
    "specific to @xmath8 excitation and decay ",
    ", keeps its shape from a few mev above threshold up to @xmath39 650 mev .",
    "i. e. , this reaction shows already on a qualitative level all features of a s - channel resonance , which carries the characteristics of a single @xmath8 excitation .    with such features in the data it is not surprising that their partial - wave analysis exhibits a clear resonant behavior in the partial waves @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( in the notation @xmath45 ) .",
    "all four partial waves describe textbook examples of a resonant behavior in real and imaginary parts of their amplitudes with close - to - perfect loopings in the argand plot ( see figs . 7 and 8 of ref .",
    "the by far dominating partial wave is @xmath41 , which governs more than 90@xmath46 of the total cross section up to @xmath39 500 mev ( see fig . 5 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at higher energies",
    "also the other three partial waves come into play .",
    "their partial wave cross sections peak right at the @xmath6 mass of @xmath47 = 2170 mev . the cross section of the @xmath41 partial wave , however , peaks already at lower energy corresponding to @xmath47 = 2130 mev .",
    "the resonant cross sections have a width of roughly 120 mev , which conforms with the width of the @xmath8 resonance .",
    "the special role of the @xmath48 partial wave has been already noted as early as 1968 by r. n. arndt in his article about the `` unbound diproton '' @xcite    all four partial waves represent resonant @xmath6 configurations .",
    "however , only @xmath41 corresponds to a configuration , where the relative orbital angular momentum between @xmath49 and @xmath8 is zero .",
    "this explains its dominant role in this reaction .",
    "also it is the only configuration , which resonates roughly 40 mev below the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "this means that the isovector s - wave interaction between @xmath49 and @xmath8 is strongly attractive with the ability to form a i(j@xmath50 ) = 1(2@xmath51 ) state with a binding of about 40 mev .",
    "since the width of the @xmath8 constituent in this state is larger than its binding energy , this state appears to be only quasi - bound .",
    "we note , however , that despite this binding the total width of this resonant state is obviously not significantly smaller than that of the free @xmath8 resonance .",
    "this result will be of importance for the discussion of resonant states in the @xmath3 system in the following paragraph .",
    "we finally note that without the assumption of a s - channel resonance the experimental result for the angular distribution to coincide with that for @xmath8 excitation and decay would not be easily understandable . in case of t - channel @xmath8 excitation on one of the nucleons by meson exchange , the relevant reference axis for the polar angle of the pion emitted in @xmath8 decay",
    "would be given by the momentum transfer @xmath52 and not by the beam axis .",
    "since the direction of @xmath52 varies with the scattering angle , the resulting cms - angular distribution for the pions with the beam axis as the reference axis , would be smeared out yielding approximately a much flatter @xmath53 dependence .      after the excursion to the @xmath6 system we come back to the discussion of the @xmath3 system .",
    "we see that similar to the resonant @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 partial waves , which peak right at the @xmath6 threshold , the @xmath3 excitation in the isovector channel @xmath30 peaks right at the @xmath3 threshold as expected from a calculation of the @xmath3 process without mutual interaction of the two @xmath8s .",
    "also the experimentally observed width of the resonance - like energy dependence of the total cross section coincides with the expected width of twice the @xmath8 width .",
    "the situation is different for the isoscalar channels @xmath54 and @xmath25 , where the data suggest a peak postion near @xmath47 = 2.41 gev , i. e. some 50 mev below the @xmath3 threshold .",
    "here the situation is reminiscent of the @xmath41 partial wave in case of the @xmath6 system .",
    "also the resonance - like behavior in the total cross section and the observed `` frozen distributions '' in the differential cross sections fulfill the conditions of a s - channel resonance in these isoscalar channels .",
    "note that with three particles in the exit channel there are now much more differential distributions than just the single angular distribution in case of only two ejectiles .",
    "however , the big difference now is that we again observe a width in the resonant cross section of 100 mev , which is , however , only half of that expected naively . in case of the @xmath41 partial wave in the @xmath6 system the binding did not lead to a noticeable change of the decay width . hence we conclude that the observed width in the isoscalar channel is obviously not just the simple result of the binding between the two @xmath8 states .",
    "it rather signals more complicated configurations in the wave function of the intermediate state , which hinder its decay  as would be expected for a non - trivial dibaryon state .",
    "our model calculations for the quasibound state in the @xmath3 system assume that the decay into the @xmath3 system proceeds via relative s - waves between the two @xmath8s .",
    "since these calculations describe the measured angular distributions very well , we conclude that the spin - parity assignment to this isoscalar intermediate state should be either @xmath55 = @xmath56 or @xmath57 , where we take into account that the two - fermion system has to be in an antisymmetric state .",
    "we note that the existence of such states has been predicted in different theoretical calculations @xcite and sometimes @xcite referred to as `` inevitable dibaryon '' .",
    "the finding of a s - channel resonance in the isoscalar @xmath58 channel has the consequence that this resonance should show up also in the elastic @xmath4 scattering channel .",
    "unfortunately in the corresponding energy region of @xmath11 = 1.0 - 1.3 gev such data are very sparse or non - existent , respectively . moreover , from the analysis of the @xmath58 data we expect the s - channel resonance to show up in @xmath4 elastic scattering with a peak cross section of several 100 @xmath59barn only , which has to be compared with a total elastic @xmath4 cross section of about 20 mb in this energy region . i.e. , only a detailed partial wave analysis of very precise elastic @xmath4 scattering data over the energy region @xmath11 = 1.0 - 1.3 gev would have the potential to sense this resonance in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 partial waves , respectively .",
    "another finding from the analysis of the @xmath25 data is that the abc effect  a @xmath2 channel low - mass enhancement in the @xmath7 spectra  is intimately connected to the appearence of the s - channel resonance in isoscalar @xmath4 and @xmath3 systems .",
    "since the abc - effect shows up also in heavier nuclear systems , this means that this resonance is a quite stable object , which even survives in the nuclear surroundings .",
    "in fact , the energy dependence measured for the @xmath1he and @xmath62he cases in previous inclusive measurements @xcite is in support of this conclusion .",
    "the observed strong energy dependence of the @xmath25 reaction certainly needs further experimental verification .",
    "this is even more true for the energy dependencies observed for the double - pionic fusion reactions leading to @xmath1he and @xmath62he .",
    "therefore we have proposed to investigate these energy dependencies in dedicated exclusive measurements at cosy using there the newly installed and upgraded wasa detector , which recently had been moved succesfully from the celsius - ring at uppsala to the cosy - ring at forschungszentrum jlich .",
