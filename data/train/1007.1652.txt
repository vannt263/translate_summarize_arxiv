    "models of static spherically symmetric configurations of selfgravitating polytropic fluids can be reduced to the analysis of the so - called lane  emden equations .",
    "they fall into the class of nonlinear ordinary differential equations .",
    "their solutions can be obtained by means of simple numerical methods or even analytically for some polytropic exponents .",
    "in contrast to that , equations describing axially symmetric models of selfgravitating polytropic fluids undergoing a stationary rotation are in general intractable analytically .",
    "they can be written in the form of the poisson equation for the gravitational potential and equations of hydrodynamics that can be formally integrated to yield an algebraic relation between the specific enthalpy , angular velocity , and the gravitational potential .",
    "another possibility , less useful computationally , but revealing the mathematical structure of the problem , is to express them as a single nonlinear elliptic equation for the specific enthalpy ( or the mass density ) with dirichlet conditions imposed on the a priori unknown boundary of the disk .",
    "we derive analytical results on accretion disks using simple physical information and certain functional analytic methods .",
    "there exists the so - called sobolev inequality @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that it can be used in order to estimate the mass of selfgravitating toroids .",
    "this approach works for those rotation laws that possess a centrifugal potential @xmath1 such that @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 is the laplacian ) .",
    "the equation of state of fluid is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 the density , and @xmath7 . in analogy to the well known lane - emden case , the estimate requires the knowledge of the maximal density and temperature of the configuration . the same bound is obtained for rotating polytropic stars .",
    "it yields rigorously , for ideal gas with the polytropic index @xmath8 , that the mass of stationary systems is not smaller than the jeans mass .",
    "that is probably the first rigorous derivation of the jeans inequality .",
    "the order of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "all relevant equations are displayed .",
    "section 3 gives the estimate for the mass of a selfgravitating disk . in section 4",
    "we discuss the spherically symmetric case .",
    "there emerges a striking similarity between the expression for the mass of a lane ",
    "emden star and the estimate that is proved in section 3 .",
    "section 5 compares results of the numerical solutions describing axially symmetric disks and the analytical estimate of this paper .",
    "this comparison shows that our approach is particularly robust in the strongly nonlinear regime , when the disk masses are much larger than the central mass .",
    "final section contains a brief summary .",
    "consider a disk of perfect fluid rotating around a central point mass . in this case",
    "stationary euler equations can be written as @xmath9 here @xmath10 denotes the fluid velocity ; @xmath11 is the gravitational potential ; @xmath6 denotes the density and @xmath5 the pressure of the fluid . for a selfgravitating disk the gravitational potential satisfies @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a gravitational constant .",
    "let @xmath14 denote cylindrical coordinates .",
    "we will consider purely rotating , axially symmetric configurations , so that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the angular velocity .    in order to find solutions of the above system of equations it is customary to assume a fixed form of the rotation law @xmath17 and the equation of state @xmath18 .",
    "there is a vast literature on the numerical solutions of such problem ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we are interested in establishing general analytic bounds on the mass of the disk .",
    "in what follows we will specialize to the polytropic equation of state @xmath4 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constant .",
    "let us introduce the specific enthalpy @xmath21 , so that @xmath22 . for the polytropic equation of state @xmath23 .",
    "computing the divergence of eq .",
    "( [ euler_eq ] ) yields @xmath24 where we have introduced the centrifugal potential @xmath25 and a constant @xmath26 .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ h_eq ] ) can be further simplified by assuming the so - called @xmath27-const rotation law , i.e , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a constant . in this case",
    "the centrifugal term on the right - hand side vanishes , and we have @xmath30 this simple form does not imply that the rotation does not influence the structure of the disk .",
    "it only means that @xmath31 is a harmonic function inside the volume occupied by a disk .",
    "let us point out that eq .",
    "( [ h_eq_simple ] ) is still difficult to solve , because the boundary condition @xmath32 is to be posed on an unknown boundary of the disk .    in this paper",
    "we will reserve the symbol @xmath33 for the domain in @xmath34 occupied by the disk .",
    "the disk boundary will be denoted by @xmath35 .",
    "( [ h_eq_simple ] ) is also valid for a static polytropic star . in that case , if we assume isotropy , introduce spherical coordinates and properly rescale variables , it reduces to the well known lane  emden equation .",
    "assume that @xmath36 . for the class of rotation laws of the form @xmath37",
    "this implies that @xmath38 , so that the @xmath27-const rotation is a limiting case .",
    "let us multiply both sides of eq .",
    "( [ h_eq ] ) by @xmath21 and integrate over @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to observe that @xmath39 where the left - hand side has been integrated by parts , and we have used the fact that @xmath32 on @xmath35 .",
    "further steps are adapted from  @xcite .",
    "the last integral in eq .",
    "( [ h_integrals ] ) can be estimated making use of the hlder inequality .",
    "for @xmath40 we have @xmath41 finally with the help of the sobolev inequality @xmath42 we arrive at @xmath43 thus @xmath44 the sobolev constant @xmath45 is a universal number in @xmath34 ( cf .",
    "the specific enthalpy @xmath21 can be extended to a function defined on @xmath34 by setting @xmath32 outside @xmath33 .",

    "the mass of a disk is given by @xmath49    let @xmath50 be @xmath51 for @xmath52 the value of @xmath50 can be estimated as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the maximum value of the enthalpy within the disk .",
    "the reversed inequality holds for @xmath55 .",
    "a combination of the above results gives the lower bound on the mass of the disk in the form @xmath56 valid for @xmath52 and @xmath36 .",

    "yet another consequence of ( [ mass_ineq ] ) can be obtained for the value @xmath64 of the polytropic index .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote volume averaged mass density and temperature , respectively .",
    "for the ideal gas one gets , after simple calculations involving a hlder inequality : @xmath67 inserting that into ( [ mass_ineq ] ) yields the estimate @xmath68 or , writing @xmath69 explicitely , @xmath70 the jeans mass is usually expressed as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a constant ( dependent on the convention of the jeans mass ) of the order of 1/2 .",
    "bound systems should possess a mass @xmath73 , according to a derivation that traditionally suffers from severe gaps .",
