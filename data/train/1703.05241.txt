    "in statistical mechanics , small systems weakly coupled to a large bath are described by canonical ensembles when the composite system ( system + bath ) is in a microcanonical state@xcite .",
    "when we deal with a closed many - body quantum systems , the reduced density matrix of a small part of the system can be proven to be almost canonical , even if the state of the overall system is pure @xcite .",
    "such gibbs - like behaviour emerges locally , in closed systems , as a direct consequence of the concentration of measure phenomenon .",
    "its application to quantum statistical mechanics goes under the name of `` canonical typicality''@xcite .",
    "it is a purely kinematic analysis on the hilbert space of the system and it can be proven in full generality by means of levy s lemma@xcite . a brief summary of canonical typicality and of levy s lemma can be found in appendix [ app : typ ] and [ app : levy ] . + in a recent paper@xcite",
    ", the authors showed that typicality arguments can be fruitfully applied to the hilbert space of the spin - network states . in this context",
    ", typicality provides a remarkable tool to study the local behaviour of a quantum geometry , in a fully kinematic approach , hence consistently with the general covariant nature of the spin - network description .    in this letter",
    "we propose a radical shift of setting where the role of `` system '' and `` bath '' is played by the boundary and bulk degrees of freedom of a generic _ ball _ of 3d quantum space .",
    "we prove that , whenever the hilbert space of the boundary is much smaller than the bulk space , the reduced state of the boundary is always a thermal state , regardless what is the specific pure state of the whole region . in a series of recent works ,",
    "such thermal states of the boundary have been interpreted as the pre - geometric equivalent of black hole configurations@xcite .",
    "our general argument then comes in strong support to this vision , suggesting an information - theoretical origin for such proto - black - hole states .",
    "+ there is more .",
    "we find that the typical character of such thermal state of the boundary is regulated by a _ threshold condition _ which reproduces , at the pre - geometric level , the famous threshold mechanism of thorne s hoop conjecture @xcite .",
    "we are then led to read this behaviour as an indirect proof of the hoop conjecture , in a purely quantum information - theoretic fashion .",
    "in many background - independent approaches to quantum gravity , loop quantum gravity@xcite , spinfoams@xcite , group field theory@xcite , the microscopic quantum structure of space - time is described by purely combinatorial and algebraic variables , in terms of non - geometric structures realised by spin - networks@xcite .",
    "they are generic graphs @xmath3 , made by vertices ( or nodes ) @xmath4 which are connected by edges @xmath5 .",
    "the edges are coloured with irreducible representations of the local gauge group of the theory . in this case",
    "the lorentz group , gauge - fixed to su(2 ) .",
    "therefore to each @xmath6 one associates an @xmath1 irreducible representation ( irrep ) labelled by a half - integer @xmath7 called spin . the representation ( hilbert )",
    "space is denoted @xmath8 and has dimension @xmath9 .",
    "to each node of the graph @xmath4 one attaches an intertwiner @xmath10 .",
    "this is an @xmath1-invariant map between the representation spaces @xmath8 associated to all the edges @xmath5 meeting at the vertex @xmath4 , @xmath11 in other words , @xmath10 is an invariant tensor , or a singlet state , between the representations attached to all the edges linked to the considered vertex .",
    "once the @xmath12 s are fixed , the intertwiners at the vertex @xmath4 actually form a hilbert space @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "a spin network state @xmath14 is defined then as the assignment of representation labels @xmath15 to each edge and the choice of a vector @xmath16 for the vertices .",
    "therefore , for a given graph @xmath3 , upon choosing a basis of intertwiners for every assignment of representations @xmath17 , the spin networks provide a basis for the space of square - integrable wave - functional , endowed with the natural scalar product induced by the haar measure on @xmath1 @xmath18= \\bigoplus_{\\{j_e\\ } } \\bigotimes_v \\mathcal{h}_v .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from a geometrical point of view , given a cellular decomposition of a three - dimensional manifold , a spin - network graph with a node in each cell and edges connecting nodes in neighbouring cells is said to be dual to this cellular decomposition .",
    "therefore , each edge of the graph is dual to a surface patch intersecting the edge and the area of such patch is proportional to the representation @xmath12 .",
    "analogously , vertices of a spin network can be dually thought of as chunks of volume ( see @xcite for the geometric interpretation of spin - networks states as collection of polyhedra )",
    ". see figure ( [ fig : poly ] ) for an example .    .",
    "a node is dual to a chunk of space , with the shape of a polyhedron with a number of faces equal to the number of links around the node.,width=3 ]    in particular , a bounded region @xmath0 , dual to a subregion of a generic spin network graph @xmath3 , includes a finite set of vertices ( @xmath19 ) and the edges connecting them ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we define a boundary @xmath2 as the set of edges which have only one end vertex laying in @xmath0 .",
    "their number is called @xmath21 .",
    "consistently , bulk edges are paths connecting vertices in @xmath0 .",
    "we can picture @xmath0 as a 3-ball and @xmath2 as its boundary 2-sphere punctured by the boundary edges .",
    "thanks to the gauge invariance at each node inside @xmath0 , we can gauge - fix this space and simplify the structure of bulk , without loosing any information @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the gauge - invariant hilbert space associated the original graph @xmath22 is isomorphic to the gauge - invariant space defined on a different graph @xmath23 .",
    "such graph consists of a single vertex intertwining the external edges of @xmath22 together with a certain number of loops @xmath24 which depends on the internal structure of @xmath22 .",
    "the number of loops is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the number of nodes and edges inside @xmath22 . if @xmath27 there are no loops and @xmath22 has trivial topology .",
    "such graph is usually called _ _ flower graph _ _ + such gauge reduction isomorphism does not produce any coarse graining , nevertheless the correspondence between the original graph and its flower is many - to - one , due to the fact that the procedure discards the combinatorial information about the internal subgraph .",

    "d ) graphic representation of the unfolding of the single vertex graph , with virtual link in red.,width=2 ]    the hilbert space of @xmath23 provides us with the most synthetic description for a region of quantum space with non - trivial internal degrees of freedom .",
    "in order to make our argument transparent we consider a simplifed set - up by working with graphs with fixed spin representations @xmath28 .",
    "this means that the gauge - invariant hilbert space of our idealised 3-ball region is given by    @xmath29\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    within @xmath23 we identify the _ boundary _ and _ bulk _ degrees of freedom of the 3-ball respectively with open edges and internal loops .",
    "the separation is motivated by the different geometric information they carry .",
    "loops are due to the presence of topological defects of the graph and carry localised `` curvature excitations '' at the vertices @xcite . on the other hand , the irreps carried by the open edges are dual to patches of the boundary surface .    starting from such separation of degrees of freedom",
    ", we can think of @xmath30 as a _",
    "bipartite _ quantum mechanical system , with boundary and bulk subspaces weakly coupled by the constraint of @xmath1 gauge invariance at the vertex . in these terms our constrained space @xmath30 can be seen as embedded in a tensor product space @xmath31 where we define the ( unconstrained ) boundary and bulk hilbert spaces , respectively , as    @xmath32    the coupling induced by the request of gauge invariance translates into correlations between boundary and bulk .",
    "+ within @xmath30 , a consistent reorganisation of boundary and bulk degrees of freedom is realised by considering the unfolding of the single vertex flower graph in a graph with two vertices , recoupling edges and loops irreps , linked by a virtual edge .",
    "an example is given in figure ( [ flowers])(d ) and it corresponds to the following re - writing of the gauge - invariant space    @xmath33    where @xmath34 runs over the irreps of the virtual link .",
    "moreover , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37,@xmath38 counts the degeneracies of the space @xmath39 in the boundary and in the bulk recoupling .",
    "the details of the way in which such decomposition is done can be found in the supplementary material , along with the information about the dimensions of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "here we only need to fix the notation .",
    "if we write a generic decomposition as @xmath42 , we call @xmath43 . all the dimensions needed in this paper can be written using @xmath44 .",
    "more details can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "as far as an observer _ external _ to the region @xmath0 is concerned , the geometry of the region @xmath0 is described by the information measured on the boundary of such region @xmath2 .",
    "such information is given by the _ reduced _ density matrix obtained by taking the partial trace of the whole state @xmath45 over the non - trivial holonomies around the loops ( bulk degrees of freedom ) @xmath46 $ ] .",
    "+ starting from the description of a region of quantum space given before , we focus on the state of the boundary . using the typicality tools ( summarised in appendix [ app : typ ] )",
    "we prove that _ whenever the dimension of the bulk hilbert space exceeds the dimension of the boundary space , the reduced boundary state is always extremely close to the canonical state on the boundary @xmath47 , regardless what is the global state of the whole region_.    the _ canonical state _ of the boundary @xmath47 is defined in the following way .",
    "first we need @xmath48 , the microcanonical state over @xmath49 :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 projects the states defined on @xmath52 onto the @xmath1 gauge invariant subspace @xmath49 , while @xmath53 is the trace of @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath47 is the partial trace of @xmath54 over the bulk degrees of freedom :    @xmath55    the quantity which we are interested in is the trace - distance@xcite between a generic reduced state @xmath56 and @xmath47 : @xmath57 . using the prescription developed in @xcite and summarised in appendix [ app : typ ] , it is possible to show that its average over the global hilbert space @xmath58 $ ] satisfies    @xmath59 \\leq \\frac{d_{\\partial r}}{\\sqrt{d_{\\mathcal{f}_r } } } \\end{aligned}\\ ]",
    "]    moreover , it can be proven that the fraction of states which are @xmath60 away from this average is incredibly small    @xmath61 } { \\mathrm{vol } \\left [ \\phi \\in \\mathcal{h}_{\\mathcal{f}_r } \\right ] } \\leq \\eta ' \\label{result}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath62 & & \\eta < \\varepsilon + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{d_{\\partial r}}{\\sqrt{d_{\\mathcal{f}_r } } } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    therefore , whenever the right - hand side of eq.([eq : bound ] ) is much smaller than one , it will be concretely impossible to distinguish the actual reduced state @xmath56 from @xmath47 .",
    "the goal is then to evaluate this bound and find the regime where the distance is effectively pushed to zero .",
    "building on the technical results derived in @xcite , we work in the regime @xmath63 , which goes along with our statistical approach . using the expression derived in @xcite",
    "we obtain    @xmath64^{3/4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the details can be found in the supplementary material .",
    "this quantity has a leading exponential behaviour , both in the number of external edges and in the number of loops over which we trace .",
    "the exponent becomes negative as soon as @xmath65 .",
    "such fast decay is present for any choice of @xmath28 , even far from the `` semiclassical regime '' @xmath66 .",
    "for example in the smallest case @xmath67 we have    @xmath68^{3/4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this is not exactly a threshold behaviour but it is a fast exponential decay , which becomes faster as we approach the semiclassical regime @xmath66 . in that regime the exponential decay of",
    "@xmath69 $ ] to zero approaches precisely a threshold behaviour , regulated by the condition    @xmath70    will will discuss the physical meaning of this condition in the final section .",
    "for the time being , we note that the left - hand side is proportional to the total area while the right - hand side is proportional to the curvature excitations carried by the internal loops . intuitively speaking",
    ", since the trace of the loop holonomy is the curvature around a path , in the semiclassical limit an increase in the number of internal loops corresponds to an increase of the gravitational energy _ density _ within the bounded @xmath0 region dual to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore the condition can be loosely interpreted as an inequality relating the area of a closed surface with the gravitational energy density inside .",
    "this suggests a connection with the inequality in the hoop conjecture .",
    "we now focus on the explicit form of the typical state of the boundary . starting from the decomposition of the constrained space given in eq.([unfolded2 ] ) , a convenient basis in either of the two subspaces is labeled by three numbers , respectively @xmath71 and @xmath72 , with @xmath73 running over the degeneracy of the irrep @xmath39 at fixed value of @xmath34@xcite .",
    "where @xmath147 $ ] stands for `` the volume of states @xmath145 such that @xmath148 '' .",
    "@xmath149 is the average of the function @xmath143 over the whole hilbert space and @xmath150 $ ] is the total volume of the hilbert space .",
    "integrals over the hilbert space are performed using the unique unitarily invariant haar measure .",
    "+ the levy lemma is essentially needed to conclude that all but an exponentially small fraction of all states are quite close to the canonical state .",
    "this is a very specific manifestation of a general phenomenon called `` concentration of measure '' , which occurs in high - dimensional statistical spaces @xcite .",
    "the effect of such result is that we can re - think about the `` a priori equal probability '' principle as an `` apparently equal probability '' stating that : as far as a small system is concerned almost every state of the universe seems similar to its average state , which is the maximally mixed state @xmath151 .",
