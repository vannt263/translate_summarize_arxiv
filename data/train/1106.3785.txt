    "multiloop scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric ( @xmath0 ) yang - mills theory have been studied extensively over the years @xcite in connection with for instance the famous ads / cft correspondence and possible finiteness of supergravity theories .",
    "remarkable results have been uncovered including new favorable evaluation methods applicable to both tree- and loop - level amplitudes .",
    "an essential part of this progress is the on - shell superspace formalism , which organizes on - shell states and scattering amplitudes in maximally supersymmetric super yang - mills theory very elegantly @xcite .",
    "the principle is to arrange the entire supermultiplet as a convenient expansion labeled by @xmath1-symmetry indices and particle number into @xmath2 superfields , one for each external leg .",
    "all possible scattering combinations are realized by formation of superamplitudes , defined as generating functions with the superfields as input , having all supersymmetric ward identities automatically satisfied .",
    "individual scattering amplitudes are available from the generating function using appropriate combinations of grassmann differential operators . using either the maximally helicity violating ( mhv ) vertex expansion @xcite or the britto - cachazo - feng - witten ( bcfw ) on - shell recursion relations @xcite superamplitudes for general particle and helicity configurations may be constructed .    in a recent paper @xcite , overlapping with @xcite , the maximally supersymmetric superspace setup was generalized to super yang - mills theory with reduced supersymmetry , i.e. with @xmath3 generators of supersymmetry .",
    "all necessary steps towards developing both a holomorphic and a non - holomorphic approach were taken . in particular",
    ", it was shown that the most general mhv generating function valid for generic supersymmetry can be derived by simple combinations of truncations and fourier transforms of the full @xmath0 superamplitude .",
    "the introduction of @xmath0 superamplitudes spawned important developments including a very convenient diagrammatic representation @xcite .",
    "for brevity , all possible contractions between external states are tracked , yielding a one - to - one correspondence between diagrams and individual scattering amplitudes .",
    "motivated by @xcite we will extend this graphical framework to @xmath3 superamplitudes .",
    "before developing the superspace formalism and discussing the mhv and @xmath4 generating functions for super yang - mills theory with less than maximal supersymmetry , we briefly remind ourselves about the @xmath0 setup .",
    "the @xmath0 vector multiplet is uniquely cpt self - conjugate allowing all on - shell states to be incorporated into a single holomorphic superfield @xmath5 written as an expansion in grassmann variables @xmath6 with @xmath7 being @xmath1-symmetry indices . within this framework",
    "the sixteen physical states in the @xmath0 supermultiplet are two gluons @xmath8 and @xmath9 , four gluino pairs @xmath10 and @xmath11 , plus six real scalars @xmath12 , all completely antisymmetric .",
    "the superfield then takes the form @xcite @xmath13 grassmann fourier transformation yields an antiholomorphic superfield , @xmath14 but with the exact same particle content encoded . because of this equivalence either representation may be preferred",
    "in order to shed light on how proliferation of amplitudes in @xmath0 super yang - mills theory is handled , the concept of superamplitudes is introduced . with @xmath2 copies of the superfield @xmath15 arranged , we organize the full @xmath2-point tree - level superamplitude ascendingly according to grassmann degree in steps of four , @xmath16 ranging from eight @xmath17 s to @xmath18 .",
    "explicit formulas for all @xmath19 amplitudes relying on bcfw shifts @xcite exist in the litterature @xcite , but our focus is on @xmath20 and @xmath4 amplitudes .",
    "it follows that all mhv amplitudes may be collected into a generating function , which we will call the mhv superamplitude , such that each term corresponds to a regular scattering amplitude involving gluons , fermions and scalars .",
    "the mhv superamplitude is defined as @xcite @xmath21 and contains in addition to the well - known overall momentum conservation , an eightfold grassmann delta function , which conserves supermomentum @xmath22 .",
    "it proves advantageous to expand the superamplitude as a sum of monomials in the @xmath17 s .",
    "factorization in the group index and @xmath23 for grassmann variables imply that @xmath24 consequently , the mhv superamplitude can be recast as @xmath25 with four - momentum conservation stripped .",

    ". it is mapped from the @xmath29 coordinates to the untilded superspace using the grassmann fourier transform .",
    "it is desirable to extend the neat @xmath0 superspace formulation to super yang - mills theory with nonmaximal supersymmetry .",
    "two different approaches exist @xcite , neither of which can be described in terms of a single superfield , due to the fact that @xmath3 super yang - mills theory is not cpt self - conjugate .",
    "instead the physical states of the @xmath30 supermultiplets can be assembled into either two conjugate superfields @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which are related to and by the truncations @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , or two holomorphic superfields @xmath31 and @xmath35 obtained from the @xmath0 superfield by suitable combinations of truncations and grassmann integrations .    here",
    "we focus on the @xmath36 formalism , since we would like to avoid the unfortunate mixing of the @xmath17 and @xmath29 variables in the @xmath37 picture , which does not lead to any obvious graphical interpretation .",
    "consider , say , the @xmath38 conjugate superfields obtained by letting @xmath39 and @xmath40 in and .",
    "it follows that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath2-point mhv configuration then has two states from the @xmath43 superfield and @xmath44 from the other .",
    "the essense of the @xmath36 approach is to keep the truncated holomorphic superfields , but discard the ones of negative overall helicity . to achieve this",
    "we observe that full description of the particle content can be maintained by supplementing @xmath15 by a new holomorphic superfield introduced in @xcite , @xmath45 where for instance @xmath46 with @xmath47 fixed but kept for notational uniformity .",
    "for clarity we list here all pairs of superfields @xmath48 $ ] for @xmath30 .",
    "states of the @xmath49-sector are hatted to be distinguished from those originating from the non - manipulated superfields . in this notation",
    "the indices take values @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51    let us define what is understood by a mhv amplitude in @xmath3 super yang - mills theory in this notation .",
    "first of all , a mhv amplitude must have @xmath52 paired indices as a consequence of truncation of the superfields . moreover , to be mhv requires two states from the @xmath49 sector and @xmath44 from the @xmath53 superfield .",
    "with this in mind we are now ready to derive the mhv superamplitude for @xmath3 .",
    "recall that the maximally supersymmetric superamplitude is a function of @xmath15 , @xmath54",
    ". suppose legs @xmath55 and @xmath56 represent states of the @xmath49-sector .",
    "we can then convert @xmath15 and @xmath57 to @xmath58 and @xmath59 by integrating out @xmath60 @xmath61 s and @xmath62 s according to .",
    "afterwards we truncate the remaining @xmath44 legs to reduce the content of the @xmath53 superfields .",
    "the only obstacle is to rearrange the integration measure appropriately , but actually the overall sign is not very important to us . @xmath63",
    "it is noticed that this generic mhv superamplitude , which is equivalent to the one derived in @xcite , as expected reduces to the original @xmath0 mhv superamplitude for maximal supersymmetry , and to the parke - taylor formula for pure yang - mills theory ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "it would be useful to have a simple visualization of the rather abstract expression for the @xmath65 superamplitude .",
    "similar to feynman graphs , such a scheme should yield a one - to - one correspondence between diagrams and component amplitudes .",
    "the basic ingredients of the @xmath0 mhv superamplitude appear in as a cyclic spinor string in the denominator and spinor products of supermomenta in the numerator .",
    "the pictorial representation for these components was developed in @xcite and the transition to @xmath3 was sketched . taking into account",
    "we see that the only structural difference between the maximally supersymmetric and the @xmath3 generating function is the number of spinor products of supermomenta .",
    "contrary to our @xmath3 mhv superamplitude , the @xmath66 integrated index lines responsible for the @xmath67 factor still carry grassmann variables with fixed @xmath1-symmetry indices in @xcite .",
    "we circumvent these by introducing a new _ sector line _ between the two states of the @xmath49-sector to catch the @xmath67 factor of .",
    "the individual terms in the spinor string in the denominator are diagrammatrically represented by a curved line without endpoints .",
    "the blue index line with endpoints translates into a spinor product of supermomenta of the corresponding individual legs . for @xmath3 , states of the @xmath49-sector",
    "must be connected with a solid green sector line without end points .",
    "identical graphs exist in the @xmath4 picture with obvious continued expressions . ]    in order to construct an index diagram for a given mhv amplitude with @xmath2 external legs in @xmath65 super yang - mills theory having @xmath52 paired @xmath1-symmetry indices , simply follow this prescription :    1 .",

    "indeed , the required supersymmetric sum over all possible on - shell states propagating in the intermediate channels may be realized as grassmann integration of superamplitudes , while the flow of @xmath1-symmetry charges is captured by index diagrams .    as an example we study a one - loop unitarity cut of a four - point amplitude with external gluons , and carry out the supersum for the @xmath73 case . for a more thorough description of unitarity cuts see @xcite and later developments @xcite .",
