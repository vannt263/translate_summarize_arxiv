    "we define a new enhancement of the integral birack counting invariant using an algebraic structure called a _ birack dynamical cocycle _ , analogous to rack dynamical cocycles introduced in @xcite and applied to enhancements in @xcite .",
    "we then reformulate and generalize the new invariant in terms of birack homomorphisms .",

    "recall that a _ framed link _ can be defined combinatorially as an equivalence class of link diagrams ( projections of unions of simple closed curves in @xmath2 onto a plane with breaks to indicate crossing information ) under the equivalence relation generated by the _ framed reidemeister moves _ : @xmath3 an _ oriented framed link _ has a choice of orientation for each component of the link , and oriented framed reidemeister moves respect orientation . for each component of a link , the _ framing number _ or _",

    "conversely , such a labeling defines a homomorphism if and only if the crossing relations are satisfied at every crossing .",

    "if a birack @xmath6 has rank @xmath18 and @xmath7 and @xmath61 are related by @xmath18-phone cord moves , then every @xmath6-labeling of @xmath7 corresponds to a unique @xmath6-labeling of @xmath61 and vice - versa ; thus the @xmath59-lattice of basic counting invariant values is tiled by a tile of side length @xmath18 .",

    "an _ enhancement _ of the counting invariant is a stronger invariant which determines @xmath1 but contains additional information about @xmath7 which can distinguish links which coincidentally have the same @xmath1 value .",
    "in this section we define birack dynamical cocycles and introduce a new enhancement of the birack counting invariant .",
    "the birack dynamical cocycle axioms come from the @xmath6-labeled framed oriented reidemeister moves and the @xmath18-phone cord move where we think of the elements of @xmath65 as `` beads '' on each semiarc .",
    "the operation @xmath66 is then the result of pushing the beads through a crossing with input birack labels @xmath33 : @xmath67 for a fixed @xmath6-labeling @xmath68 of an oriented link diagram @xmath7 , let @xmath69 be the number of assignments of elements of @xmath65 to semiarcs in @xmath7 such that the above pictured condition is satisfied at every crossing .",
    "the birack dynamical cocycle axioms are chosen so that for every @xmath65-labeling of an @xmath6-labeled oriented link diagram before a reidemeister or @xmath18-phone cord move , there is a unique corresponding @xmath65-labeling after the move .",
    "that is , @xmath70 is an invariant of @xmath6-labeled oriented framed isotopy mod @xmath18 .",
    "analogously to @xcite , we define the _ birack dynamical cocycle invariant _ by counting the bead labelings as a signature for each birack labeling :    by construction , we have    if @xmath7 and @xmath61 are ambient isotopic oriented links , then @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    ".    we can simplify the new enhancement with the observation that an @xmath65-labeling of an @xmath6-labeled diagram is really a labeling by pairs in @xmath73 , and the birack dynamical cocycle axioms are precisely the conditions required to make @xmath73 a birack under the map @xmath74 defined by @xmath75 we will denote this birack structure on @xmath73 as @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , the `` forgetful homomorphism '' @xmath77 defined by @xmath78 is a birack homomorphism which we may think of as a coordinate projection map .",
    "we can thus think of the enhancement @xmath79 as starting with @xmath73-labelings of @xmath7 and collecting together the @xmath73 labelings which project to the same @xmath6-labeling .",
    "this leads us to a generalization : let @xmath0 be any birack homomorphism .",
    "for each @xmath30-labeling @xmath80 , we obtain a signature @xmath81 for @xmath68 by counting the number of birack homomorphisms @xmath82 such that the diagram commutes .",
    "@xmath83 the multiset of such signatures is an enhancement of @xmath84 . note that not every labeling of @xmath7 by @xmath30 necessarily factors through @xmath85 ; some @xmath86s could be zero .",
    "such labelings contribute @xmath87 to @xmath88 , so the constant term in @xmath89 counts the number of @xmath30-labelings of @xmath7 which do not factor through @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath90 and @xmath0 is projection onto the first factor , then @xmath91 and @xmath92 . in the case of the cartesian product of two biracks @xmath93",
    ", we can say what the @xmath89 looks like :    if @xmath93 is a birack of rank @xmath18 and @xmath0 is the coordinate projection homomorphism , then we have @xmath94    we simply note that for each writhe vector @xmath95 , the @xmath30- and @xmath40-labelings are independent .",
    "hence , for each @xmath30-labeling of a diagram @xmath7 with framing vector @xmath63 , there are @xmath96 @xmath40-labelings .",
    "next , a few straightforward observations .",
    "if @xmath0 is an isomorphism , then @xmath97 .    if @xmath0 is a constant map , then @xmath98",
    "we end this section with a connection to recent work on @xmath99-racks .",
    "let @xmath100/(s^2-(1-t)s)$ ] .",
    "@xmath99-rack _ is a birack structure on a @xmath101-module @xmath6 given by @xmath102 in @xcite , an invariant @xmath103 was defined by collecting together the @xmath6-labelings of a link diagram which project to the same @xmath104 labeling under the map @xmath105 .",
    "we note that @xmath106 is the same as @xmath107 in our present terminology .",
    "in this section we collect a few computations , examples and applications of the new invariant .",
    "we begin with an explicit example of computing @xmath89 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a birack projection .",
    "the invariant @xmath89 can be understood as an enhancement of the birack counting invariant with respect to @xmath6 , thinking of collecting together @xmath6-labelings which project to the same @xmath30-labeling ; alternatively , we can understand @xmath89 as an enhancement of the counting invariant with respect to @xmath30 , where for each @xmath30-labeling we find how many @xmath6-labelings project to it via @xmath85 .",
    "the next examples show that @xmath89 is a proper enhancement , i.e. @xmath89 is not determined by either @xmath1 or @xmath84 .",
    "in our final example we compare @xmath89 values on certain virtual knots to demonstrate that @xmath89 is not determined by the jones polynomial or the generalized alexander polynomial .",
    "we end with a few open questions for future research .",
    "we have used primarily small cardinality examples for speed of computation and convenience of presentation ; we note that even these small cardinality examples with @xmath30 the trivial birack on two elements suffice to show that @xmath89 is not determined by the integral counting invariant , the jones polynomial or the generalized alexander polynomial .",
    "faster algorithms for computation of @xmath89 for larger biracks should allow more exploration of @xmath89 ."
