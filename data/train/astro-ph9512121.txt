    "as a star approaches the red giant branch ( rgb ) , its convective envelope deepens , eventually dredging up products of main sequence nucleosynthesis ( _ first dredge - up _ ) .",
    "as the star ascends the rgb , the convective envelope first continues to deepen , and then retreats ; the point of deepest convection marks the end of first dredge - up .",
    "deepest first dredge - up leaves behind a sharp composition discontinuity . for low mass stars ( @xmath5 ) ,",
    "the hydrogen burning shell catches up to and erases this discontinuity while the star is still on the rgb ; for higher masses ( @xmath6 ) , the star leaves the rgb before this can take place . after the completion of core helium burning",
    ", the star ascends the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , and the convective envelope deepens again . for low mass stars ,",
    "this is of little consequence , as it does not reach as deep as first dredge - up ; however , for the higher mass stars ( @xmath7 for stars of solar metallicity ) , it reaches deeper than the layers mixed by first dredge - up , bringing more nucleosynthesized material to the surface ( _ second dredge - up _ ) .    in the last decade ,",
    "a wealth of new observations has become available for the cno abundances in the envelopes of rgb stars ( for population  i , see , e.g. , harris , lambert , & smith 1988 ; gilroy 1989 ; gilroy & brown 1991 ; charbonnel 1994 ; charbonnel , brown , & wallerstein 1998 , and references therein ; for population  ii , see , e.g. , carbon et al .",

    "several puzzles arose in interpreting these observations . for low mass population  i stars , many of the observed ratios were in conflict with the considerably higher values predicted by standard stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "for globular clusters ( i.e. , low mass population  ii stars ) , the observed order of magnitude decline in c / fe on the rgb was in conflict with theory , which predicted an almost negligible decline ( see , e.g. , smith & tout 1992 ) .",
    "an analogous puzzle has arisen from observations of oxygen isotope ratios in agb stars ( see , e.g. , harris et al .",
    "1987 , and references therein ) , and been accentuated recently by new high - precision measurements of oxygen isotopic ratios in meteoritic grains which were formed in circumstellar envelopes , and are believed to have originated in rgb and agb stars ( huss et al .",
    "1994 ; nittler et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "some of the observed abundances are much smaller than can be understood in terms of standard stellar evolution theory .",
    "it has been suggested that the above conflicts might all be resolved if low mass stars experienced some form of extra deep mixing , below the conventional convective envelope ( see , e.g. , dearborn , eggleton , & schramm 1976 ; sweigart & mengel 1979 ; smith & tout 1992 ; charbonnel 1994 , 1995 ; boothroyd , sackmann , & wasserburg 1995 , hereafter bsw95 ; denissenkov & weiss 1996 ) .",
    "this extra mixing would take material from the convective envelope , transport it down to regions hot enough for some nuclear processing ( in the outer wing of the h - burning shell ) , and then transport it back up to the convective envelope ; bsw95 referred to this as `` _ cool bottom processing _ '' ( cbp ) .",
    "gilroy & brown ( 1991 ) , charbonnel ( 1994 ) , and charbonnel et .",

    "thus one needs a clear understanding of first dredge - up , before one can understand cbp .",
    "many first dredge - up calculations have dealt only with solar metallicities , i.e. , population  i stars ( e.g. , iben 1965 , 1966a , b , 1967 ; dearborn , tinsley , & schramm 1978 ; becker & cox 1982 ; vandenberg & smith 1988 ; landr et al .",

    "1993a , b ; charbonnel et al .  1993 , 1996 ;",
    "meynet et al .",

    "note however that the first dredge - up values of and c / n for these models were reported by charbonnel ( 1994 ) .",
    "since many observations deal with field population  ii stars and globular clusters , and with magellanic cloud stars ( of intermediate metallicity ) , we have carried out first and second dredge - up calculations of the cno isotopes for a wide range of metallicities .",
    "note that the second dredge - up models were standard ones ; they do not take into account any effects that extra mixing might have had in earlier stages of evolution in low mass stars .",
    "wasserburg , boothroyd , & sackmann ( 1995 , hereafter wbs95 ) computed parametric models of cbp in solar - metallicity stars , which suggested that the puzzle on the rgb and the puzzle on the  agb might both be resolved .",
    "charbonnel ( 1995 ) and denissenkov & weiss ( 1996 ) used a diffusive mixing algorithm to compute cbp models of certain isotopes in low - mass population  ii stars ; the results presented in this paper in general agree with theirs . in the present paper ,",
    "we use the results of computations similar to those of wbs95 to estimate how cbp would alter the first dredge - up cno abundances , and present a simple estimate of the relative strength of cbp as a function of stellar mass and metallicity .",
    "similar results for the light elements , , , , , and   are presented in sackmann & boothroyd ( 1998a ) .    for the cno isotopes , we have computed estimates of the enrichment of the interstellar medium from first and second dredge - up and cbp in stars of near - solar metallicity , relative to the enrichment resulting from supernovae .",
    "we considered stars of 38 different masses from 0.8 to  @xmath15 , evolving them self - consistently from the pre - main sequence through first and second dredge - up until the first helium shell flash ( for low and intermediate mass stars ) , or to the point where the program failed due to core carbon ignition during second dredge - up ( for higher masses ) .",
    "note that , in low mass stars , we use `` second dredge - up '' to indicate the deepest penetration of the convective envelope on the early agb  this is a modification of the standard terminology , in which one would say that second dredge - up did not occur if the convective envelope reached less deep on the agb than on the rgb ( as is the case in low mass stars ) . for evolutionary program details ,",
    "see boothroyd & sackmann ( 1988 ) , sackmann , boothroyd , & fowler ( 1990 ) , and sackmann , boothroyd , & kraemer ( 1993 ) . note that the rezoning algorithm has been refined to track the composition profiles more accurately .",
    "this caused only minor changes in our results , the largest change being in the ratio produced by first dredge - up : in wbs95 , our values for this ratio lay near the bottom of the range of theoretical calculations by various investigators ( as shown in fig .  1 of wbs95 )",
    ", but with the refined rezoning our values lie near the middle of this `` theoretical range '' ( as may be seen from fig .",
    "[ figcbpc13 ] below ) .",
    "cool bottom processing ( cbp ) was computed as follows ( in a manner similar to wbs95 ) .",
    "the envelope structure was taken from a full stellar model , upon which was superimposed extra mixing ( using a `` conveyor - belt '' circulation model ) .",
    "we assumed that the extra mixing reached down into the outer wing of the h - burning shell ; the temperature difference @xmath16 between the bottom of mixing and the bottom of the h - burning shell was considered a free parameter , to be determined by comparison with the observations .",
    "it was assumed that the value of @xmath16 remained constant during the evolution up the rgb .",
    "the changes in the envelope structure were followed as the star ascended the rgb ( `` evolving rgb '' cbp models , unlike the `` single episode '' cbp models of wbs95 , where it was assumed that the envelope structure was constant in time ) .",
    "envelope structures from full stellar models of mass @xmath17 were used , for @xmath4 , 0.007 , 0.001 , and  0.0001 .",
    "higher stellar masses were considered by simply adding more mass to the convective envelope , and changing to the appropriate first dredge - up abundances and rgb starting point ; this should be a good approximation for the rgb stars we considered , namely , those with masses small enough to have degenerate helium cores ( and thus a long rgb ) .",
    "we assumed that cbp began at the point on the rgb where the hydrogen shell reached ( and erased ) the the molecular weight discontinuity ( `` @xmath0-barrier '' ) that was created at the point of deepest first dredge - up ( charbonnel 1994 ) . as in wbs95 , the free parameter @xmath16 was determined by matching the observed / ratios for the six post - rgb stars in  m67 , which has solar metallicity , and a main sequence turn - off mass of @xmath18 ( in general we ignored the difference between the turn - off mass and the initial mass of rgb stars in a cluster  in m67 , where it is largest , this difference should still be @xmath19 ) .",
    "the observed / ratios in m67 range from 11 to  16 ( gilroy 1989 ; gilroy & brown 1991 ) , comparable to observational error ; if this scatter were real , it would correspond to a range @xmath20 in our `` evolving rgb '' cbp models .",
    "the mean observed ratio of  13 corresponds to a value of @xmath21 , which was the value we used in the cbp calculations reported in  ",
    "[ results ] .",
    "note that this is shallower extra mixing than was used in our earlier `` single episode '' models of cbp on the rgb ( wbs95 ) , which used @xmath22 ; these `` single episode '' cbp models yield the observed / ratios after a mixing episode lasting @xmath23yr on the lower rgb , while the `` evolving rgb '' cbp models of the present work do not attain the observed ratios until the tip of the rgb .",
    "the tight constraint on @xmath16 in our models is due to the strong temperature dependence of the cno burning rates  a change in @xmath16 of only  0.01 results in a change of @xmath24% in the amount of cno processing . for the evolutionary stages considered here , with thin h - burning shells , parameterizing the effective depth of extra mixing by a constant @xmath16 value",
    "is roughly equivalent to assuming that extra mixing always reaches down to the point with the same molecular weight gradient ( see also charbonnel et .",
    "al 1998 ) .",
    "we used the opal 1995 interior opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , with alexander molecular opacities ( alexander & ferguson 1994 ; tout 1997 ) at low temperatures ; these latter require a value of @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the ratio of the convective mixing length to the pressure scale height ) to obtain a correct solar model ( sackmann et al .  1990 , 1993 ) .",
    "tests were also made using older opacity tables .",
    "interior opacities from the los alamos opacity library ( laol : from keady [ 1985 ] ) yielded only slightly different amounts of dredge - up ( see    [ results ] ) , while molecular opacities from sharp ( 1992 ) or from keady ( 1985 ) required a value of @xmath27 but had no effect on dredge - up .",

    "nuclear reaction rates from caughlan  & fowler ( 1988 ; hereafter cf88 ) were used , except for the the @xmath72 rate , where the rate from cf88 was multiplied by a factor of  1.7 , as recommended by weaver & woosley ( 1993 ) , and for the -destruction reactions @xmath73 and @xmath74 , where the rates from blackmon ( 1996 , hereafter bl96 ) were used .",

    "abundance profiles in stars of higher mass are qualitatively similar , though the peaks and dips in the profiles tend to lie at somewhat larger values of the normalized mass coordinate  @xmath81 ( a shift similar to that from fig .",
    "[ figdr1]a to  [ figdr1]b ) .",
    "the abundance changes produced by first dredge - up ( presented in    [ dredge ] ) can be understood in terms of these profiles .",
    "for example , the relative width of the  pocket increases somewhat with increased stellar mass in low mass stars , but is almost constant in intermediate mass stars .",
    "this explains why first dredge - up enrichment increases as a function of stellar mass for low masses , and then levels off for intermediate masses ( the increasing depth of dredge - up with stellar mass is irrelevant , as the entire pocket is dredged up . ) as pointed out by charbonnel ( 1994 ) , for population  i stars the observed ratios in the luminosity range expected for first dredge - up are in agreement with the theoretical models of first dredge - up ( see also   [ dredge ] ) ; the subsequent observed reduction in in low mass stars is not due to further dredge - up , but to cool bottom processing ( cbp ) .",

    ", our depths of first dredge - up agree with those computed by el  eid ( 1994 ) and charbonnel ( 1994 ) ; for @xmath8 , our @xmath82 case agrees with charbonnel s , but we find significantly shallower first dredge - up for  @xmath83 ( @xmath84 for opal opacities or 0.75 for laol , as opposed to her value of  0.425 , where @xmath85 is the deepest mass layer in the star reached by the convective envelope during dredge - up ) .",
    "this indicates that the depth of first dredge - up in low - metallicity intermediate mass stars is sensitive to the physical inputs of the stellar models ( e.g. , equation of state , opacities , and nuclear rates ) that determine the onset of core helium burning and thus the end of the rgb .",
    "fortunately , such differences are erased by second dredge - up .",
    "second dredge - up in low mass stars is significantly shallower than first dredge - up , and thus would be expected to have negligible effect on their surface composition ( though this _ may _ not always be true : see    [ nodredge ] ) ; in intermediate mass stars , where it reaches deeper than first dredge - up , second dredge - up is of key importance .",
    "figure  [ figmrdr ] does not show the effect on second dredge - up of using the older laol interior opacities ( rather than opal ) , but the relative shifts are similar to those of first dredge - up , namely , equivalent to a shift to the next - lower metallicity case for population  i stars , and little or no effect in population  ii stars .",

    "note that for our most massive stars ( @xmath86 ) , central carbon ignition takes place during second dredge - up .",
    "we report the depth of second dredge - up at the point during this stage when our program failed ( see dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ figmrdr ] ) ; second dredge - up might reach deeper during subsequent evolution .",

    ", weaver & woosley s ( 1993 ) supernova models have an overproduction factor of  2.2 ; if low and intermediate mass stars produce an additional amount that is 4.3 to  5.7 times as much , this is equivalent to a supernova overproduction factor of 12 to  14 . for",
    ", supernovae overproduction is  3.3 ; an added amount 2.4  times as much is equivalent to an overproduction factor of  11 , and hot bottom burning would increase this to no more than  14 . for",
    ", the supernova overproduction factor of  16.4 is only slightly reduced by partial destruction in low and intermediate mass stars , to 15 or  16 .",
    "all three of these isotopes are thus consistent with the heavier elements . for  ,",
    "weaver & woosley ( 1993 ) give a supernova overproduction factor of  12.6 ; if this was an overestimate by a factor of  4 ( as discussed above ) , their overproduction factor would be  3.2 .",
    "adding the contribution from low and intermediate mass stars to this latter value would yield the equivalent of an overproduction factor of  @xmath167 ; hot bottom burning would not increase this very much , according to the most recent bl96 -destruction rates ( sackmann & boothroyd 1998b ) .",
    "consistency is thus obtained for with the most recent rates .",
    "note that most of the enrichment is due to third dredge - up in those low to intermediate mass stars that eventually become carbon stars on the agb , and essentially all the   enrichment is due to supernovae , which produce about the right amount , according to weaver & woosley ( 1993 ) .",
    "thus we have a reasonably self - consistent picture of the enrichment of the interstellar medium in cno elements from stars of near - solar metallicity .",
