    "the large value of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath1 is consistent with the fact that the latter measures the decay of the self - dipole correlation to a finite value , while the first measures the time needed for the self - dipole autocorrelation to decay to zero .",

    "we find that @xmath4 , calculated for @xmath109  , diverges at @xmath110  k with a power law with exponent @xmath111 , consistent with our estimates of @xmath112 and @xmath16 , respectively ( fig .",
