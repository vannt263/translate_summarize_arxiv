    "recently , the study of complex networks became a common focus in many branches of science @xcite .",
    "many measurements are used to characterize the role of a node in network structure and function , ranging from simple indices like degree and closeness @xcite to complicated centralities like betweenness @xcite , pagerank score @xcite and some random - walk - based indices @xcite . in comparison , the study of edge s role is less extensive",
    ". actually , an edge may play an important role in enhancing the locality or be significant in maintaining the global connectivity . how to differentiate these two roles",
    "is an interesting and unsolved problem .",
    "a related issue is the famous _ weak ties theory _",
    "@xcite , which tells us that the job opportunities and new ideas usually come from people with weak connections .",
    "further more , the weak ties can enhance the spreading of rumor @xcite and knowledge @xcite , keep the stability of biological functions @xcite and improve the accuracy of network structure prediction @xcite .",
    "moreover , experimental and theoretical analysis on a large - scale mobile communication network showed that the weak ties play the leading role in maintaining the global connectivity @xcite , and they are important in the process of the emergence of social communities @xcite , which is a common topological characteristics of networks and has been extensively studied in the literature of network theory @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the strength of a tie is quantified by the time spent on communication , while in this article we consider a similar problem on document networks where the tie strength is characterized by content similarity .",
    "analogous to the observation of the social communication network , we find that the ties connecting less similar documents are more significant in maintaining global connectivity",
    ".    generally speaking , the strength information , such as the communication time and content similarity , is not easy to be obtained . therefore , to quantify the edge significance only making use of the information of observed",
    "topology is very valuable in practice . for this purpose",
    ", we propose the index _",
    "bridgeness_. to our surprise , this index can better characterize the edge significance in maintaining the global connectivity than the content similarity in document networks .",
    "furthermore , extensive numerical results on disparate networks indicate that the bridgeness is also better than some well - known structural indices on edge significance , including the _ jaccard coefficient _",
    "@xcite , _ degree product _ @xcite and _ edge betweenness _ @xcite .",
    "social networks usually exhibit two important phenomena , being respectively the homophily @xcite and weak ties effects @xcite . homophily tells us that connections are more likely to be formed between individuals with close interests , similar social statuses , common characteristics or shared activities .",
    "the well - known transitivity or triadic closure phenomenon @xcite can be taken as a reflection for homophily .",
    "homophily contributes to the formation of most connections in social networks .",
    "in contrast , some connections are formed between less similar individuals , which usually have weaker strength .",
    "weak ties phenomenon refers to the fact that these connections may play crucial roles in maintaining the global connectivity and holding key functions , such as the flow of new information and knowledge .",
    "compared with social networks , the homophily and weak ties phenomenon are less studied for document networks . in document networks , each node corresponds to a document with textual contents .",
    "typical examples are the world wide web and scientific citation networks .",
    "two documents are more likely to be connected if they are relevant , e.g. , webpages presenting the same topic and articles belonging to the same research area .",
    "the probability that two documents are connected increases with their content similarity @xcite and the probability that three documents form a triangle increases with their trilateral content similarity @xcite .",
    "these indicate that the content similarity in document networks plays the similar role as the tie strength in social networks .",
    "inspired by onnela _",
    "et al _ @xcite , we quantify the weak ties phenomenon according to an edge percolation process . generally speaking ,",
    "if the weak ties phenomenon exists in terms of content similarity , the network will disintegrate much faster when we remove edges successively in ascending order of content similarity than in descending order .",
    "two quantities are used to describe the percolation process .",
    "the first one is the fraction of nodes contained in the giant component , denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "a sudden decline of @xmath0 will be observed if the network disintegrates after the deletion of a certain fraction of edges .",
    "another quantity is the so - called _ normalized susceptibility _ , defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of components with size @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the size of the whole network , and the sum runs over all components but the largest one . considering @xmath5 as a function of the fraction of removed edges @xmath6 ,",
    "usually , an obvious peak can be observed that corresponds to the precise point at which the network disintegrates @xcite .",

    "the data set contains all the papers from 1998 to 2007 , and the basic statistics of this network is shown in table  [ tab : data_description ] .",
    "we collect keywords presented in titles and abstracts of papers and construct a keyword vector space according to the standard procedures in information retrieval @xcite . here",
    "keywords refer to those words which are not stop words such as `` a '' , `` the '' , `` of '' , etc .",
    "the content of a paper is then represented as a keyword vector , @xmath10 , which gives the frequency of each keyword .",

    "as mentioned above , tie strength is a good indicator for edge s role of maintaining global connectivity .",
    "however , the strength information is usually hard to be obtained . in social networks",
    "it requires the personal information or historical activities , while in document networks it has to crawl the content and calculate the textual similarity .",
    "the processes are probably complicated , time consuming , or even infeasible .",
    "therefore , an index depending only on topological information is of great advantage in practice . as we have mentioned , in social and document networks similar or relevant nodes are apt to connect to others and form local clusters .",
    "clique is the simplest structure to describe the locality in a network @xcite .",
    "a clique of size @xmath17 is a fully connected subgraph with @xmath17 nodes @xcite , and the clique size of a node @xmath18 or an edge @xmath19 is defined as the size of maximum clique that contains this node or this edge @xcite .",
    "we found that in social and document networks we observed , the clique structures of different sizes are prevalent .",
    "recently , gonzlez _ et al _ @xcite have reported the presence of k - clique communities in school friendship networks from the add health database and the topology of c - network formed by communities . in his work nodes shared by different communities",
    "are critical in connecting the c - network . here",
    "we focus on the roles of edges , i.e. , edges in cliques mainly contribute to locality while those between cliques are important in connecting the network . accordingly , we define the bridgeness of an edge as @xmath20 where @xmath18 and @xmath21 are the two endpoints of the edge @xmath19 . for example , in fig .",
    "2 , the clique sizes of @xmath18 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the clique sizes of @xmath19 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath28 .",

    "[ bridgeness_strength_relation ] that there is a negative correlation between bridgeness and content similarity , namely the weaker content similarity between two papers is , the stronger its bridgeness will be . combined with the conclusion in the previous section , we infer that edges with strong bridgeness will play a more important role in maintaining the global connectivity . fig .",
    "[ link_percolation_result_pnas]c shows that if the edges with larger bridgeness are removed first ( corresponding to the curve labeled by _ max _ ) , the network quickly splits into many pieces , while if we start removing the edges with smaller bridgeness ( corresponding to the curve labeled by _ min _ ) , the network gradually shrinks . as shown in fig .",
    "[ link_percolation_result_pnas]d , a sharp peak is observed in the former case .",
    "in addition , the critical point ( corresponding to the peak in @xmath31 ) in fig .",

    "three representative indices used for comparison are introduced as follows ( for more information about how to quantify the edge significance , please see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    *",
    "_ jaccard coefficient _",
    "jaccard coefficient is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath18 and @xmath21 are the two endpoints of the edge @xmath19 and @xmath34 is the set of @xmath18 s neighboring nodes . * _ degree product_. degree product is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the degree of node @xmath18 . an extended form , @xmath37 has been recently applied in the studies of biased percolation @xcite . notice that we only care about the order of the edges , so the values of @xmath38 ( if @xmath39 ) play no role on the results and we there choose @xmath40 , the same as in @xcite . * _ edge betweenness centrality _ @xcite .",

    ", bridgeness is expected to be applied in practice .",
    "in this article , we investigate the weak ties phenomenon in document networks .",
    "empirical analysis indicates that the weak ties , namely the edges connecting less similar nodes in content , play more significant role in maintaining the global connectivity .",
    "inspired by the strong correlation between the existence of an edge and the strength of that edge @xcite , we believe the edge significance in maintaining the global connectivity can be well characterized by some indices depending solely on the topological structure .",
    "accordingly , we propose a local structural index , called bridgeness .",
    "compared with both the content similarity and three well - known topological indices , bridgeness always leads an earlier network disintegration in the edge percolation process , indicating that bridgeness performs best in characterizing the edge significance .",
    "this will help us in some real - life applications such as controlling the spreading of diseases or rumor and withstanding the targeted attacks on network infrastructures .",
    "the percolation process is carried out on real - world networks and the results illustrate that the networks are fragile when removing edges with larger bridgeness .",
    "these networks are monopartite , i.e. , nodes in these networks are of no distinction .",
    "it will be necessary to generalize the definition of bridgeness when facing other network configurations such as bipartite networks , as lind _",
