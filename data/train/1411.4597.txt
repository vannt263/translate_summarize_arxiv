    "graphs are used to describe a wide range of situations in a precise yet intuitive way .",
    "different kinds of graphs are used in modelling techniques depending on the investigated fields , which include computer science , chemistry , biology , quantum computing , etc .",
    "when system states are represented by graphs , it is natural to use rules that transform graphs to describe the system evolution .",
    "there are two main streams in the research on graph transformations : ( i ) the algorithmic approaches , which describe explicitly , with a concrete algorithm , the result of applying a rule to a graph ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and ( ii ) the algebraic approaches which define abstractly a graph transformation step using basic constructs borrowed from category theory . in this paper",
    "we will consider the latter .",
    "the basic idea of all approaches is the same : states are represented by graphs and state changes are represented by rules that modify graphs .",
    "the differences are the kind of graphs that may be used , and the definitions of when and how rules may be applied .",
    "one critical point when defining graph transformation is that one can not delete or copy part of a graph without considering the effect of the operation on the rest of the graph , because deleted / copied items may be linked to others .",
    "for example , rule @xmath0 in figure  [ fig_rulesandgraphs](a ) specifies that a node shall be deleted and rule @xmath1 that a node shall be duplicated ( labels the copy ) . what should be the result of applying these rules to the grey node of graph @xmath2 in figure  [ fig_rulesandgraphs](b ) ?",
    "different approaches give different answers to this question .",
    "the most popular algebraic approaches are the double - pushout ( dpo ) and the single - pushout ( spo ) , which can be illustrated as follows : @xmath3|{po }   l \\ar[d]_{m } & \\ar@{}[rd]|{po}k \\ar[l]|{{\\phantom{\\big(}l{\\phantom{\\big ) } } } } \\ar[d]^{d }   \\ar[r]|{{\\phantom{\\big(}r{\\phantom{\\big ) } } } }     & r \\ar[d]^{m ' } \\\\",

    "a graph @xmath2 rewrites into a graph @xmath6 using rule @xmath7 and match @xmath8 if the diagram above to the left can be constructed , where both squares are pushouts .",
    "conditions for the existence and uniqueness of graph @xmath9 need to be studied explicitly , since it is not a universal construction .",
    "with dpo rules it is easy to specify the addition , deletion , merging or cloning of items , but their applicability is limited . for example ,",
    "rule @xmath0 of figure [ fig_rulesandgraphs ] is not applicable to the grey node of @xmath2 ( as it would leave dangling edges ) , and a rule like @xmath1 is usually forbidden as the _ pushout complement _",
    "@xmath9 would not be unique .    in the spo approach @xcite ,",
    "a rule is a _ partial _ graph morphism @xmath10 and a match is a total morphism @xmath5 .",
    "a graph @xmath2 rewrites into a graph @xmath6 using rule @xmath11 and match @xmath8 if a square like the one above to the right can be constructed , which is a pushout in the category of graphs and partial morphisms . deleting , adding and merging items",
    "can easily be specified with spo rules , and the approach is appropriate for specifying deletion of nodes in unknown context , thanks to partial morphisms .",
    "the deletion of a node causes the deletion of all edges connected to it , and thus applying rule @xmath0 to @xmath2 would result in graph @xmath12 in figure [ fig_rulesandgraphs](b ) .",
    "however , since a rule is defined as a single graph morphism , copying of items ( as in rule @xmath1 ) can not be specified directly in spo .",
    "a more recent algebraic approach is the sesqui - pushout approach ( sqpo )  @xcite .",
    "rules are spans like in the dpo , but in the left square of a rewriting step , graph @xmath9 is built as a _ final pullback complement_. this characterises @xmath9 with a universal property , enabling to apply rule @xmath0 , obtaining the same result as in the spo approach ( @xmath12 ) , as well as rule @xmath1 , obtaining @xmath13 as result .",
    "also @xmath1 has a side effect : when a node is copied all the edges of the original node are copied as well .",
    "rules do not specify explicitly which context edges are deleted / copied , this is determined by the categorical constructions that define rule application . in general , in all algebraic approaches , the items that are preserved by a rule will retain the connections they have with items which are not in the image of the match .",
    "this holds also for items that are copied in the sqpo approach .",
    "however , there are situations in which the designer should be able to specify which of the edges connecting the original node should be copied when a node is copied , depending for example on the direction of the edges ( incoming or outgoing ) , or on their labels , if any . for example , if the graphs of figure  [ fig_rulesandgraphs ] represent web pages ( nodes ) and hyperlinks among them ( edges ) it would be reasonable to expect that the result of copying the grey page of @xmath2 with rule @xmath1 would be graph @xmath14 rather than @xmath13 , so that new hyperlinks are created only in the new page , and not in the pages pointing to the original one . as another example",
    ", the fork and clone system commands in linux both generate a clone of a process , but with different semantics .",
    "both commands precisely differ in the way the environment of the cloned process is dealt with : see @xcite for more details .",
    "these examples motivate the rewriting approach that we introduce in this paper . in order to give the designer the possibility of controlling how the nodes that are preserved or cloned by a rule are embedded in the context graph , we propose a new algebraic approach to graph transformation where rules are triples of arrows with the same source @xmath15 .",
    "arrows @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the usual left- and right - hand sides , while @xmath18 is a mono called the _ embedding _ : it will play a role in controlling which edges from the context are copied .",

    "we are going to show how agree rewriting can be used for such anonymization procedure .",
    "of course , due to space limitations we can not deal with a complete example and will focus on the first task of the anonymization process : the creation of a clone of the social network in which only non - sensitive links are copied . we model the following idealized scenario : the administrator of a social network sells anonymized data sets to third - parties so that they can be analyzed without compromising confidentiality .",
