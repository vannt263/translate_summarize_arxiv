    "thermodynamics was first introduced as a practical study to clarify the optimal performance of heat engines  @xcite and has become one of the most important fields in physics  @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the development of experimental technology are realizing heat engines which are out of the scope of the standard thermodynamics , i.e. , small - size heat engines",
    ". quantum - scale and mesoscopic thermomotors , which used to be imaginary devices , are being realized in laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the functions of bio - molecules , which are micro - machines in nature , are being clarified too  @xcite .",
    "we can not apply the standard thermodynamics to these nanometer - size heat engines as it is , because it is a phenomenology for macroscopic systems .",
    "statistical mechanics , another fundamental field of physics , has been applied to the small - size heat engines whose small - size working body is connected to the infinitely large heat baths , and is achieving a splendid success  @xcite .    many studies of such engines  @xcite adopt a model of a microscopic internal quantum system connected to a macroscopic external agent .",
    "they use the following setup and assumption :    1 .",
    "thermodynamic operation of the internal quantum system by an external system is represented by a unitary operator of the time - dependent hamiltonian of the internal quantum system which is controlled by external parameters .",
    "[ enu : unitary_dyn ] 2 .",
    "the work performed to the external system is equal to the energy loss of the internal quantum system .",
    "this approach has a practical advantage that we can formulate thermodynamic relations by analyzing only the internal quantum system .    however , there are always two concerns about the validity of this approach .",
    "one is about the assumption of the unitary dynamics and the other is about the definition of the work . in actual situations of heat engines , the internal system , whether quantum or not , is always attached to an external macroscopic system  @xcite , and hence the dynamics of the internal quantum system can not be exactly unitary .",
    "it is not guaranteed either that all energy loss of the internal system becomes the work done to the external system .",
    "is it accurate enough to approximate the true dynamics with a unitary dynamics ?",
    "is it legitimate to regard the energy loss as the extracted work ? in spite of these concerns , the approach has been accepted by many researchers , because there have been results out of this approach which seem to be consistent with thermodynamics .",
    "for example , we can derive some thermodynamic relations  @xcite and a kind of quantum extension of the jarzynski equality  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we face these two concerns .",
    "we claim here that the work out of a heat engine should be measured by means of a macroscopic system , for example , as movement of a macroscopic piston or wheel . from this point of view",
    ", the work extraction from the internal quantum system by the macroscopic system can be described as a standard quantum measurement process , in which the measurement result is evaluated on the side of the macroscopic system . in other words , the time evolution of the internal system",
    "is described as a quantum measurement process and the extracted work is regarded as a measurement outcome of this process .",
    "this formulation , recently introduced by hayashi and tajima  @xcite , raises a serious problem of the conventional approach in the form of a general trade - off relation .",
    "the relation shows that when the time evolution of the internal system is approximated to a unitary , it becomes difficult to fix the amount of extracted work .    in the present paper ,",
    "we first demonstrate the inappropriateness of the unitary time evolution of the internal system ( namely the assumption  [ enu : unitary_dyn ] above ) .",
    "it was pointed out by hayashi and tajima that the amount of the extracted work is not able to be evaluated on the side of the external system when the time evolution of the internal system is approximated to a unitary one  @xcite .",
    "it was also illustrated with a plain example by tasaki , who is one of the advocates of the conventional approach  @xcite . in order to demonstrate this fact , we show for a simple model that the conventional approach has a problem regarding the fluctuation of the work .",
    "more specifically , we show that the variance of the energy transferred to the external system diverges when the time evolution of the internal system is approximated to a unitary , and is completely different from that of the energy loss of the internal system .",
    "this result demands us to change the derivation of the quantum jarzynski equality from the previous ones  @xcite based on the conventional approach , which employed the _ internal _ unitary time evolution and regarded the measured value of the energy loss of the internal system as the `` work '' , whereas the energy gain of the _ external _ system is the actual work that we can use .",
    "the jarzynski equality derived from the previous approach does not contain relevant information about the fluctuation of the actual work .    in order to resolve this problem",
    ", we next derive the quantum jarzynski equality based on the measurement - based work extraction of hayashi and tajima  @xcite .",
    "this quantum jarzynski equality is the relation of the work measured by the external macroscopic apparatus , which is equal to the measured value of the energy gain of the external system .",
    "therefore , our derivation correctly contains the information about the fluctuation of the actual work , namely the energy gain of the external system .",
    "there has been another approach to the two concerns , in which they  @xcite used an internal quantum system connected to an external quantum system .",
    "this approach assumes that the time evolution of the total system is unitary and the work extracted from the internal system is defined as the energy gain of the external system .",
    "we claim that the setup in our approach is more realistic than in this approach  @xcite in the sense that our external system is a macroscopic measurement apparatus .",
    "in this section , using a toy model , we consider the problem as to whether we can represent the time evolution of an internal system in terms of a unitary one .",
