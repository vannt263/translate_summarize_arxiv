    "the dynamics of periodically modulated quantum systems has attracted both theoretical ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and experimental ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) interest during recent years .",
    "it is known that a modulated system has resonances at which the tunneling is either suppressed or enhanced . in the neighborhood of a resonance ,",
    "the behavior of the system is very sensitive to the modulation frequency .",
    "the suppression of tunneling by modulating the energy difference between the modes is known as the coherent destruction of tunneling ( cdt ) @xcite .",
    "cdt was discovered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the motion of a charged particle in a lattice under the influence of an oscillating electric field was studied .",
    "it was shown that an initially localized particle remains localized in a one - dimensional lattice if the amplitude and frequency of the electric field are chosen suitably . in ref .",
    "@xcite , cdt was found to occur in systems consisting of a particle subjected to a periodic force and trapped in a double - well potential .",
    "recently , the coherent destruction of tunneling has been actively studied in the context of ultracold bosonic atoms ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "unlike the cdt , which is typically observed under the condition that the tunneling coupling is larger than or comparable to the interaction energy , the enhancement of tunneling by modulation can take place in a system where the interaction energy dominates over the tunneling coupling . in the absence of modulation , the large interaction energy suppresses tunneling for energetic reasons @xcite .",
    "this leads to a very long tunneling period ( the time needed for @xmath0 particles to tunnel from one mode to another and back ) .",
    "however , by modulating the tunneling matrix element , it is possible to enhance the many - particle tunneling and thereby reduce the tunneling period @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we analyze the reasons behind the enhanced tunneling with the help of a detailed floquet analysis . in order to make the analysis more complete , we consider also systems where either the interaction strength or the energy difference between the modes is modulated .",
    "we find that these two methods provide an alternative way to enhance tunneling .",
    "it is shown that the width of the resonance , that is , the range of modulation frequencies corresponding to the enhanced tunneling , depends strongly on whether the tunneling matrix element , the interaction strength , or the energy difference between the two modes is modulated ; the resonance is wider in the former two cases .",
    "we explain this difference with the help of floquet theory and the eigenvalues of the non - modulated hamiltonian .",
    "we analyze also the coherent destruction of tunneling using floquet theory .",
    "it is known that cdt can be caused by modulating either the energy difference between the modes or the interaction strength .",
    "we study only the floquet spectrum of the former system because it has not received much attention in the literature , unlike the floquet spectrum of the interaction - modulated system @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , we present two ways to generate noon - like ( schrdingers - cat  like ) states .",
    "the first is based on the cdt induced by a large - amplitude modulation of interaction strength , whereas the second makes use of a small - amplitude modulation of the tunneling coupling .",

    "then the eigenstates of @xmath29 are also eigenstates of @xmath47 and either @xmath52 or @xmath53 holds for the components of the eigenvectors of @xmath29 . in the former case ,",

    "we denote such an eigenstate by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 @xmath59 indicates that the eigenvector is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) . if @xmath60 and the signs of the eigenvectors are defined appropriately , we get @xmath61 which is valid to zeroth order in @xmath62 . for non - zero @xmath63 or @xmath64 ,",
    "the floquet eigenstates are neither exactly symmetric nor antisymmetric because @xmath65 is not invariant under the parity operator .",

    "we see that the behavior of @xmath85 as a function of the modulation frequency @xmath14 depends strongly on whether @xmath2 or @xmath4 is modulated .",
    "this difference can be explained using floquet analysis .    before analyzing the system in detail , we first summarize two key points .",
    "one is the parity of the operator whose coefficient is modulated , and the other is the shift in the phases of the floquet eigenvalues due to an avoided crossing .",

    "therefore , @xmath88 couples floquet eigenstates of the same parity , and @xmath65 couples those of the opposite parity .",
    "this means that in the case of modulated @xmath2 [ @xmath4 ] , there is an avoided crossing between floquet eigenstates of the same [ opposite ] parity .",
    "the differences in the behavior of the tunneling period can be attributed to the parities of the states undergoing an avoided crossing .",
    "below we show that usually @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) holds for odd ( even ) @xmath0 . however , this is not necessarily the case near avoided crossings where the values of @xmath92 are shifted .",
    "these shifts lead to either suppression or enhancement of the tunneling .",

[ sec_timeindep ] ) and @xmath88 couples floquet eigenstates with the same parity , the first avoided crossing occurs between @xmath130 and @xmath135 [ the left red solid circle ] as the modulation frequency increases . due to the repulsion between these two levels , the splitting between @xmath141 is increased near the avoided crossing and thus the tunneling period is reduced .",
    "the second avoided crossing takes place between @xmath128 and @xmath134 [ the right red solid circle ] .",
    "note that , after the first avoided crossing , the states @xmath148 and @xmath149 have been interchanged [ between the red solid circles ] and the energy splitting between @xmath141 remains large until the second avoided crossing at which @xmath150 and @xmath151 are interchanged .",
    "these successive avoided crossings lead to a reduction of the tunneling period in a wide range of @xmath152 .      because of the large quasienergy splitting between @xmath124 and @xmath126 , the points where @xmath141 crosses @xmath124 and @xmath126 are far apart .",

    "[ fig_amp ] .",

    "one can also view a type 1@xmath162 crossing as a combination of type 2 and type 3 crossings .",
    "when @xmath163 is small , the coupling between the two states that undergo an avoided crossing is small .",
    "thus the difference @xmath166 remains very small even near the avoided crossing .",
    "therefore , unlike in a type 1 crossing , the inverted configuration of @xmath141 ( i.e. , the situation @xmath167 ) can not be sustained throughout the region between the two avoided crossings .",

    "the resonance around @xmath164 is caused by a crossing between @xmath141 and @xmath146 .",

    "far from the avoided crossing the relation @xmath90 holds . because of this and the fact that @xmath134 is pushed downward , the phases @xmath134 and @xmath135 cross ( the left small blue circle ) before the avoided crossing ( the left large red circle ) . after the first avoided crossing , the states @xmath148 and @xmath151 are interchanged .",
    "next , @xmath128 and @xmath135 undergo an avoided crossing ( the right large red circle ) , and the corresponding states are interchanged . because now @xmath167 , these phases cross after the second avoided crossing ( the right small blue circle ) , so that @xmath171 far away from the crossing .",
    "the two crossing points and the two avoided crossings correspond to the two divergences and the two reductions of the tunneling period , respectively .",

    "this is one of the major findings of this paper .",
    "we note that all the other resonances are also much narrower than in the case of modulated @xmath2 .",
    "this is because the operator @xmath65 , which is related to the tilt , does not contribute to the single - particle tunneling , unlike @xmath88 .",
    "the range of @xmath14 characterizing the width of the resonance is comparable to the quasienergy separation at the avoided crossing .",
    "this is approximately proportional to @xmath172 in the case of @xmath2 modulation and to @xmath173 in the case of @xmath4 modulation .",
    "the latter is smaller than the former by a factor @xmath174 .",
