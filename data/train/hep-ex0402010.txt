    "the spin muon collaboration ( smc ) has extensively studied polarized deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering using the high energy muon beam at cern and large polarized hydrogen and deuterium targets .",
    "this program was initiated by the observation in a previous cern experiment ( emc ) that only a small fraction of the proton spin is carried by the spin of the quarks  @xcite .",
    "the smc results have confirmed this observation for protons and provided the first measurement of the spin structure of deuterons which allowed for the verification of the fundamental bjorken sum rule  @xcite .",
    "the high energy polarized data from smc , combined with the high precision data from the slac  @xcite and desy  @xcite experiments at lower energy , cover a kinematic range allowing for a qcd analysis of the spin structure function @xmath5 .",
    "various analyses have been performed at next - to - leading order with different input parameterizations for the polarized parton densities and different choices of the fitted parameters  @xcite .",
    "they provide consistent results for the polarized quark densities but bring little information on the polarized gluon density @xmath6 .",
    "this is an expected feature since @xmath5 is sensitive to gluons only through its @xmath7 evolution and the available @xmath5 data cover only a narrow range in @xmath7 at a given value of @xmath8 .",
    "in particular it is still not possible to test the hypothesis , formulated many years ago , that the gluon spin may account for a sizable fraction of the nucleon spin  @xcite .",
    "a direct measurement of the gluon polarisation is possible via the photon gluon fusion ( pgf ) process , which is illustrated in fig.[fig : pgf ] , together with the two other lowest order diagrams : the virtual photon absorption ( leading process `` lp '' ) and gluon radiation ( qcd compton scattering `` qcd - c '' ) . since the contribution of the pgf diagram is small , the event selection procedure should be very effective in discriminating the pgf process from other channels .",
    "this can be achieved either by selecting events where a charmed particle is produced ( e.g. a d meson ) or events with hadrons of large transverse momenta ( @xmath9 ) relative to the virtual photon direction  @xcite .",
    "both possibilities will be used in the compass experiment presently running at cern  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present an evaluation of the gluon polarization , @xmath10 , from the smc data .",
    "we limit the analysis to the dis region ( @xmath11  gev@xmath12 ) and select events with high @xmath9 hadrons .",
    "the smc experimental setup was not optimized for the detection of hadrons produced at large angles , so the precision of the result is obviously limited .",
    "this is , however , the first attempt to tag pgf with light quark production in a dis experiment .",
    "a determination of the gluon polarization from events with high @xmath9 hadrons has been attempted on the ep data from the hermes experiment  @xcite at lower incident energy and in a kinematic range where quasi - real photo - production is dominant .",
    "experimentally observed spin - dependent effects are small and have to be determined from the cross section asymmetry defined as the ratio of polarized ( @xmath13 ) and unpolarized ( @xmath14 ) cross sections a^n= = ^ - ^ , [ eq : asym ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to anti - parallel and parallel configurations of the nucleon and incoming lepton spins . at the parton level",
    "the hard scattering cross section consists of three terms corresponding to the lp , qcd - c and pgf processes . according to the factorization theorem @xmath14 and @xmath17",
    "can be written as convolutions of the parton distributions ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , hard - scattering cross sections ( @xmath20 ) and fragmentation functions @xmath21 of partons into hadrons :    @xmath22    = f d .",
    "[ eq : unpol ] the parton distributions stand for quarks , antiquarks , and gluons .",

    "the up and down arrows correspond to parallel and anti - parallel configurations of the parton and nucleon spins .",
    "after insertion of the full expression for @xmath14 and @xmath13 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : asym ] ) , the final expression for the cross section asymmetry with production of at least two hadrons with large transverse momenta , @xmath27 , reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the average partonic asymmetries and @xmath30 the cross section ratios of the different processes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pgf ] , with respect to the total cross section in the selected sample .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath27 thus permits an evaluation of the gluon polarization if all other elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluon ] ) are known .",
    "the quark asymmetry @xmath31 is approximated by the value of @xmath32 obtained in inclusive measurements .",
    "the partonic asymmetries @xmath33 are calculated for simulated events and averaged over the selected sample ; in the kinematic region covered by the smc data , they are found to be positive for the first two processes and negative for pgf .",
    "the ratios @xmath30 are taken from the simulated sample to which the same selection criteria are applied as to the data .",
    "the statistical precision of the gluon polarization determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluon ] ) depends on the precision of the measured asymmetry @xmath27 and on the fraction of pgf events ( @xmath34 ) in the final sample .",
    "therefore the aim of the present analysis is to select a large enough sample with a maximal contribution of pgf events .    the description of hadron production in dis muon data in terms of the three processes of fig .",
    "[ fig : pgf ] has been successfully tested in previous experiments  @xcite .",
    "other processes , such as those involving resolved photons , are expected to have small contributions for @xmath7 above 1  gev@xmath12 and are not considered here .",
    "the experimental setup at the cern muon beam consisted of three major components : a polarized target , a magnetic spectrometer and a muon beam polarimeter .",
    "a detailed description of the experiment and of the analysis of the inclusive data can be found in refs .",
    "the muon beam polarization , @xmath35 , was determined from the spin asymmetries measured in polarized muon - electron scattering and from the energy spectrum of positrons from muon decays and was found to be @xmath36 for an average beam energy of 187.4  gev  @xcite .",
    "the target consisted of two cells filled with butanol , deuterated butanol or ammonia  @xcite .",
    "the two cells were polarized in opposite directions by dynamic nuclear polarization .",
    "the average target polarizations , @xmath37 , were approximately @xmath38 for protons and @xmath39 for deuterons , with a relative error @xmath40 of  3 - 5% .",
    "the polarization was reversed five times a day .",
    "the counting rate asymmetry , @xmath41 , is determined from the number of events counted in upstream and downstream target cells before and after polarization reversal .",
    "this is done by solving the resulting second order equation , as described in @xcite .",
    "the cross - section asymmetry , @xmath27 , is related to @xmath41 by : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the effective dilution factor , which takes into account the dilution of spin asymmetries by the presence of unpolarizable nuclei in the target and also by radiative effects on the nucleon .",
    "the effect of unpolarizable materials can be expressed in terms of the numbers @xmath44 of nuclei with mass number @xmath45 and the corresponding total spin - independent cross sections @xmath46 .",
    "the radiative effects on the nucleon @xcite are taken into account through the ratio of one photon exchange to total cross - sections @xmath47 .",
    "the evaluation of the effective dilution factor for inclusive events and for events with observed hadrons is described in ref .",
    "polarized radiative corrections are applied to the asymmetries as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this analysis polarized radiative corrections and dilution due to radiative effects are reduced because processes without hadrons are excluded .",
    "the total sample of data collected by the smc experiment during the years 1993 - 1996 with muon beam of @xmath48=190  gev and longitudinally polarized target was used for the analysis .",
    "it consists of samples of similar size taken on polarized protons and deuterons .",
    "the standard cuts on inclusive kinematic variables @xcite , @xmath4915  gev and @xmath5019  gev were imposed to reject events with poor kinematic resolution and muons from hadron decay , respectively .",
    "the cut @xmath510.9 removes a region where the uncertainty due to radiative corrections becomes large .",
    "two other cuts were applied in close relation to the formalism used in the analysis : a cut @xmath521  gev@xmath12 rejects the region dominated by nonperturbative effects and allows to interpret the results in terms of partons .",
    "a cut @xmath530.4 removes events which carry little spin information due to a small virtual photon polarization .",
    "in addition , cuts on the muon scattering angle were applied in order to match the angular acceptance of the hardware triggers .    in the leading process ( lp )",
    "most hadrons have small @xmath9 as only the intrinsic @xmath54 of quarks in the nucleon  @xcite and the fragmentation mechanism contribute to it .",
    "a different situation occurs for qcd - c and pgf , where hadrons mainly acquire transverse momentum from primarily produced partons . for this reason ,",
    "the requirement of two observed hadrons with large transverse momenta enhances the contribution of the pgf and qcd - c processes in the selected sample .    in the present analysis ,",
    "the events of interest include a reconstructed beam muon , a scattered muon , and at least two charged hadrons .",
    "they represent about 20% of the total number of events with reconstructed beam and scattered muons , used for inclusive studies .",
    "hadron tracks were accepted if they could be associated to the primary interaction point , i.e. the vertex , defined by the beam and scattered muons .",
    "the same association criteria as in the smc analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite were applied . in order to suppress the contribution from the target fragmentation region ,",
    "cuts on the reduced longitudinal momentum of the hadron , @xmath55 , and on the hadron fractional energy , @xmath56 , were applied .",
    "the further requirement of two hadrons with @xmath57  gev selects about  5% of the events passing all previous cuts . the electron contamination to this sample",
    "is expected to be negligible because electrons are generally produced at low @xmath9 .",
    "this is confirmed by the ratio of the energy deposited in the electromagnetic part of the calorimeter to the total deposited energy , which does not show any peak at 1.0 for tracks with @xmath58  gev .",
    "after all selections the total number of remaining events amounts to about 80k for the proton and 70k for the deuteron sample .",
    "the interactions were simulated using the lepto 6.5 generator  @xcite with a leading order parameterization of the unpolarized parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the spin dependent effects were calculated using poldis  @xcite with a consistent set of polarized parton distributions  @xcite .",
    "the kinematic limits of the mc generation were defined so as to cover the full kinematic region of the data .",
    "default values were used for most of the steering parameters of the lepto generator .",
    "below we discuss only the modified conditions and parameters .",
    "the matrix elements of first order qcd processes exhibit collinear divergences in the cross channel and different schemes are used to avoid such singularities .",
    "the so - called @xmath59 scheme , which allows for lower values of the @xmath60-parton center of mass energy @xmath61 , was used in the simulation with modified cut - off parameters .",
    "the effect of the cut - off values on any observable distribution for events with high @xmath9 hadrons is only marginal .",
    "the description of interactions requires the choice of two scales : a factorization scale , which appears in the parton densities , and a renormalization scale which appears in expressions depending on the strong coupling constant  @xmath62 . here",
    "the usual choice of @xmath7 was made in both cases . in these conditions , after kinematic cuts on event variables only , the generated sample contains 8% pgf events .    in order to describe the data ,",
    "it was found necessary to change the values of two fragmentation parameters in jetset  @xcite . the function @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the mass of the quark , expresses the probability that a fraction @xmath66 of the available energy will be carried away by a newly created hadron .",
    "the parameters ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) were modified from their default values ( 0.3 , 0.58 ) to ( 0.5 , 0.1 ) , a change making the fragmentation softer .",
    "this modification was inspired by a similar study done by the hermes experiment  @xcite and seems to work also in the present case , with smaller deviations from the default values .",
    "however , we are looking here at a particular sample and have no possibility to check if the monte carlo sample generated with these modifications would correctly describe the full data . the uncertainty connected with these modifications has been estimated and included in the systematic error .",
    "the scattered muon track of each simulated event was followed through the magnet aperture .",
    "trigger conditions were checked and prescaling factors applied in order to reproduce the relative trigger rates in the simulated sample .",
    "kinematic smearing was applied to muon and hadron tracks and geometric smearing to the vertex position .",
    "in addition , the loss of tracks due to chamber inefficiencies was taken into account by applying detector plane efficiencies to the simulated events and by removing the tracks which did not fulfill the minimal requirements for reconstruction .",
    "secondary interactions of hadrons have to be taken into account to reproduce the distribution of interaction vertices along the target axis .",
    "hadrons were rejected from the sample according to the probability of re - interaction in the polarized target material . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] shows the agreement obtained for the vertex position along the beam axis in one of the proton data sets .",
    "the simulation was performed for each year of data taking separately . to get a good description of the kinematic variables it was required to use specific beam parameters for every year , including small changes in angles , and to take into account the exact target position .",
    "the distributions of kinematic variables as well as the particle distributions in detectors were checked with identical selection criteria applied to data and mc . for the simulated events",
    "the cuts were applied to the smeared variables .",
    "the distributions for data and mc were normalized to the same number of events .",
    "the distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath7 for interactions on protons are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kinem ] .",
    "the obtained agreement is at the level of 10 - 25% for all kinematic event variables .",
    "the level of agreement for deuterons is very similar  @xcite .",
    "the same comparisons were done for hadron variables . for simulations performed with the unmodified fragmentation function clear discrepancies",
    "are observed for the hadron production angle @xmath69 and the longitudinal momentum @xmath70 , while satisfactory agreement is obtained for @xmath9 , except at the highest values .",
    "the observed differences at the highest values of @xmath9 can be explained by the approximate description of the non - gaussian tails of the distributions used for smearing and by the effects of real photon radiation , which are not taken into account in the present analysis .",
    "it was checked that the discrepancy for the @xmath69 angle could not be removed by using different smearing parameterizations or even by an artificial increase of smearing .",
    "agreement between data and simulation could only be achieved by applying a cut on the hadron production angle @xmath71  rad .",
    "this cut , however , removes about 25% of the selected sample and can not be justified since there is no reason why the simulation should not describe the hadrons produced at low @xmath69 .",
    "therefore modified simulation conditions providing a better description of the data were searched for .    when the modifications of the fragmentation function parameters are applied ( cf .",
    "section v.a ) , the agreement becomes satisfactory over a wide range of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath70 and @xmath69 distributions is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : modhadrons ] for the hadron with highest @xmath9 .",
    "the second hadron is also well described by the mc  @xcite .",
    "we concluded that the parameters of the longitudinal fragmentation function @xmath72 have to be modified in order to obtain a good description of the data over the full range of hadron production angle @xmath69 .",
    "since it is difficult to check if the modified set of parameters correctly describes the semi - inclusive hadron distributions , the analysis has been performed in parallel with modified fragmentation as well as with the standard fragmentation and an additional cut on @xmath71  rad .",
    "in order to compare the merits of various selections of pgf events , we will use the _ efficiency _ @xmath73 , which is the ratio of the number of pgf events accepted by the selection criteria to the total number of pgf events , and the _ purity _ @xmath34 ( eq.3 ) , which is the ratio of the number of selected pgf events to the total number of selected events .",
    "the optimal selection is obviously the one providing the highest values of @xmath73 and @xmath34 but , in general , an increase of the former will result in a decrease of the latter .",
    "the purity is @xmath74 for the full sample of events with at least 2 charged hadrons .",
    "the additional requirement of two hadrons with @xmath75 gev defines our reference sample for which @xmath76 and , by definition , @xmath77 .",
    "the effects of cuts were studied for the following variables : @xmath78 , the sum @xmath79 , hadron charges ( same or opposite sign ) , the azimuthal angle @xmath80 between the momenta of the two hadrons with respect to the virtual photon direction , and the invariant mass of the two hadrons ( see also ref .",
    "it was found that the selection on @xmath81 is optimal for enhancing the pgf purity and that further requirements on the hadron charges do not bring any significant improvement .",
    "[ fig : comp_traf ] shows the variation of @xmath34 with @xmath73 when the cut on @xmath81 is varied up to 4  gev@xmath12 .",
    "it is seen that the purity increases only very slowly when the cut is made more restrictive while the efficiency drops very rapidly .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that one of the background processes ( qcd - c ) has a similar dependence on the @xmath81 cut as pgf .",
    "the approximation made in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gluon ] ) by the use of @xmath32 for the asymmetry on quarks is only valid if the fraction of pgf events in the selected sample is much higher than in the inclusive one , i.e. close to the maximum value of 0.33 .",
    "the efficiency also needs to be sufficiently high to allow a meaningful analysis . as a compromise ,",
    "we have fixed the cut at 2.5 gev@xmath12 , which corresponds to @xmath73 = 0.30 and @xmath34 = 0.31 .",
    "the combination of several variables into a single parameter has also been investigated in a classification procedure based on a neural network @xcite .",
    "we considered the variables which characterize the dis event ( @xmath8 , @xmath7 , @xmath82 , and the multiplicity of tracks ) and those which describe the two selected hadrons with highest @xmath9 ( transverse and longitudinal hadron momenta , charges of the hadrons , energy fraction of the hadrons , and the azimuthal angle @xmath80 ) .",
    "the classification procedure was trained on a monte carlo sample where the actual process is known for each event . as a result",
    ", the procedure provides a single value , called `` nn response '' , within the range ( 0,1 ) .",
    "high values of this response correspond to events which , according to the classification algorithm , are more likely to be pgf than background processes .",
    "a threshold on the network response can thus be used to select a pgf enriched sample .",
    "the variation of @xmath34 vs. @xmath73 for various choices of the nn response threshold is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : comp_traf ] .",
    "it is observed that at equal efficiency the nn approach always provides samples with higher purity than the selection based on @xmath81 . for further analysis ,",
    "a threshold of 0.26 was chosen , which corresponds to @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "a similar purity is obtained with the @xmath81 cut at 2.5 gev@xmath12 but with an efficiency of 30% .",
    "therefore a better statistical precision on the measured asymmetry will be obtained with the neural network method .",
    "alternatively , a higher nn threshold corresponding to a pgf efficiency of 30% would yield a sample where the purity is about 37% , i.e. 6% higher than the value obtained with the @xmath81 cut .",
    "the comparison of the two selected samples shows that the nn procedure selects a large fraction of events with @xmath85 gev@xmath12 but also covers the lower range of @xmath81 .",
    "it was also checked that the distributions of nn responses are compatible for data and monte - carlo events .",
    "the smc data taken from 1993 to 1996 were split into periods of data taking , corresponding to about 15 days each .",
    "the asymmetry for a given year is the weighted average of the asymmetries calculated for each period of data taking . splitting the data into smaller subsamples",
    "gives identical results within the expected statistical fluctuations .",
    "the distribution of the vertex position along the beam axis , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : vertex ] , shows that the ratio of acceptances for the upstream to downstream target cells is about 0.7 . the method used for asymmetry calculation , described in @xcite ,",
    "is suited for such an acceptance difference .",
    "the asymmetry calculations were done for the entire sample which has a purity @xmath76 and for the two selection methods with enhanced @xmath34 ( @xmath85 gev@xmath12 and nn response @xmath86 0.26 ) .",
    "the results given in fig .",
    "[ fig : asym_vs_pt2 ] and table  [ tabasy ] show that the asymmetries do not change significantly with the selection .",
    "also the asymmetries obtained for proton and deuteron are compatible within errors .",
    "the statistical error is larger for the selection based on @xmath81 because a smaller fraction of events is selected ( 28 % vs. 42 % ) .",
    "the errors of the measured @xmath27 asymmetry for the selected samples are dominated by statistics .",
    "the contributions to the systematic uncertainty on @xmath27 are detailed in table [ data : selfinall ] for the two selections with enhanced @xmath34 .",
    "the most significant ones come from the false asymmetries , the fraction of radiative processes ( @xmath87 ) and the polarized radiative corrections . for the false asymmetries",
    "an upper limit from the time variation of the acceptance was taken under the assumption that the reconstruction for each of the three tracks ( scattered muon and two hadrons ) is affected independently .",
    "the method used for estimating these effects is described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the radiative corrections are small due to the limited phase space for real photon emission in events where a significant fraction of the available energy is taken by the two hadrons with large @xmath9 .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath87 and polarized radiative corrections were taken equal to the full size of the inelastic contribution .",
    "the effect of real photon radiation on the event kinematics and , in particular , on the value of @xmath9 itself has not been taken into account in view of the limited precision of the present analysis .",
    "the gluon polarization is evaluated from eq .",

    "the individual contributions to the systematic error are given , for both selection methods , in table  [ syst : gluon ] .",
