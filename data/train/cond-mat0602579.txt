    "long standing interest in the pyrochlores stems from their inherent geometrical frustration due to the metal ions forming a network of corner - sharing tetrahedra . for insulating pyrochlores , where localized magnetic moments sit on the vertices of these tetrahedra , competing interactions lead to a wealth of novel states of fundamental interest .",
    "ground states of infinite degeneracy are a typical signature of such frustrated systems.@xcite while for insulating systems the intimate connection between spins and the lattice topology leads to the observed frustration effects , it is an open question how charge , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom are coupled in itinerant systems and how they influence each other .    in this context , the superconductivity recently found in @xmath1  has been of considerable interest:@xcite it has been thought that a spin liquid ground state resulting from frustration in these structures might favor superconductivity through singlet pairing by a resonating valence bond.@xcite at the time of its discovery , @xmath1  was the second pyrochlore superconductor known after cd@xmath13re@xmath13o@xmath14.@xcite soon after , the discovery of superconducting @xmath2@xcite and @xmath15@xcite followed .",

    "for example , @xmath18 decreases from @xmath19 for @xmath1  to @xmath20 for @xmath2  and to @xmath21 for @xmath15 .",

    ", we present field and temperature dependent thermodynamic and transport measurements on @xmath2  and @xmath1 .",

    "the pellet with a mass of @xmath29 to @xmath30 is put into a quartz tube and silver oxide ag@xmath13o ( aldrich , @xmath31 ) is added to create an appropriate oxygen partial pressure during the synthesis .",
    "the evacuated and sealed tube is then inserted into a furnace preheated to @xmath32 , kept there for @xmath33 , cooled to @xmath34 at a rate of @xmath35 , and then cooled to room temperature at a rate of @xmath36 .",
    "the resulting black single crystals of size up to @xmath37 in diameter have grown on the wall of the quartz tube and on the surface of the precursor pellet .",

    "the lattice parameter refined from x - ray single crystal measurements is found to be @xmath38 .",
    "no signature of impurity phases like oso@xmath13 or koso@xmath39 was found in heat capacity and magnetization measurements .    for the specific heat measurements , we have selected about five dozen of the most regularly shaped single crystals out of a single badge .",
    "the total mass of these crystals amounts to @xmath40 ( see inset to fig .  [",
    "fig : cvshandcrystals ] ) , which is enough to measure specific heat with a relaxation method .",
    "special attention must be paid , however , to measure the addendum contribution as it makes up a significant fraction of the total mass .",
    "the specific heat has been measured in a physical properties measurement apparatus using an adiabatic relaxation technique ( quantum design , ppms ) .",
    "resistivity has been measured by a standard four terminal approach also using the ppms and the dc magnetization has been measured in a squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms ) .",

    "the synthesis procedure of these polycrystalline @xmath2  samples is described elsewhere.@xcite",
    "in order to determine the mass enhancement in the normal state and the magnitude of the electron - phonon coupling , it is necessary to measure the sommerfeld coefficient of the superconductor by driving it into the normal state .",
    "usually this is achieved by applying a magnetic field exceeding the upper critical field @xmath41 .",
    "owing to a high @xmath42 of @xmath1  which is unaccessible by our @xmath3 magnet , it is not possible to tune @xmath1  into its normal state below about @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore resort to an extrapolation method to estimate the sommerfeld coefficient : first we measure the phase boundary line @xmath44 to as low a temperature and high field as possible .",
    "we then extrapolate @xmath41 to @xmath45 and estimate the sommerfeld coefficient based on the measured @xmath46 versus magnetic field curve at a low temperature .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in the following .",
    "we extract the upper critical field @xmath41 from @xmath47 data for @xmath1  and from both @xmath47 and @xmath48 data for @xmath2 . for both methods",
    ", we use a construction of equal area to determine the critical field .",
    "the two methods result in almost identical @xmath41 as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hc2 ] . in our experience ,",
    "the @xmath41 slope at @xmath18 for both @xmath2  and @xmath1  are rather stable quantities varying little from sample to sample .",
    "we therefore have a high level of confidence that the observed slope is indeed intrinsic to the material and not mainly limited by a mean free path caused by impurity scattering .",
    "the initial slope of the critical boundary at @xmath49 for @xmath1  is @xmath50 , in agreement with the revised value in ref .",
    "the full @xmath44 dependence can not be mapped out with the @xmath3 magnet , so we need to extrapolate to lower temperatures and we proceed in two different ways : first , we notice that @xmath44 in @xmath2  is rather well described by the standard whh expression , with an initial slope of @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hc2]).@xcite if we were to assume the same functional form to hold also for @xmath1 , @xmath53 is estimated .",
    "considering that a typical energy of low - lying phonons in @xmath1  is around @xmath54 , @xmath41 might be underestimated in this way .",
    "alternatively , one can extrapolate linearly to @xmath55 and would estimate @xmath56 . pursuing this second extrapolation",
    "further is motivated by our observation that the last data points in our data lie closer to a straight line extrapolation of the lower - field data , while the whh curve starts deviating from the data in this region . in the rest of this paper , we thus consider both extrapolations , denoting with ( a ) the whh version , and with ( b ) the linear method .",
    "numerical values for ( b ) will be enclosed in braces \\{}.",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath2  data are fitted best by the whh formula in the orbital limit ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with a large @xmath58 expected for the heavy os ion .",
    "therefore , pair - breaking effects of the magnetic field on the spin degrees of freedom are negligible due to the randomizing effect of the spin - orbit scattering on the phase of the superconducting electrons .",
    "an upper limit of the critical field in the case where spin - orbit scattering could be ignored , is given by the pauli - limiting field : for @xmath1  it is @xmath59 \\{@xmath60 } , while for @xmath2  it is about @xmath61 .",
    "here we have used the values for @xmath62 and @xmath10 determined from our measurements as described later and listed in table [ tab : td_params ] . for @xmath2 , this field is well above the measured upper critical field , while for @xmath1  the comparison depends on the extrapolation of @xmath41 .",
    "support for the fact that @xmath41 is determined by the orbital motion of the electrons and not by their spin , is provided by the ratio of the slopes @xmath63 for the two materials @xmath2  and @xmath1 .",
    "the slopes are proportional to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the electronic scattering time and @xmath66 the fermi velocity . for the fermi velocities we use @xmath67 for @xmath2  and @xmath68 for @xmath1.@xcite the ratio of the fermi velocities squared , taking into account the renormalization of the fermi velocity and assuming the same @xmath65 for both materials , is @xmath69 \\{@xmath70}. this is indeed close to the ratio of @xmath71 for @xmath2  and @xmath1 : @xmath72 , suggesting that the pair - breaking is caused conventionally by the effect of the magnetic field on the orbital magnetism of the electrons .",
    "the difference in magnitude of the upper critical fields is therefore in line with the different mass enhancements .",
    "we have measured the field dependence of @xmath46 of @xmath1  at @xmath73 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cvshandcrystals ] .",
    "the addendum is @xmath74 of the total heat capacity at @xmath75 , @xmath76 at @xmath77 , and @xmath78 at @xmath79 .",
    "below @xmath80 , the addendum makes up more than @xmath81 of the total heat capacity , and even though both data sets are very smooth , this leads to relatively larger scatter after taking the difference of the two data sets .",
    "for this reason , data below @xmath82 have been omitted in the graph and in the fitting procedure .",
    "we parameterize the measured curve by @xmath83 .",
    "a least squares fit down to @xmath84 using this form results in @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is given in oersted .",
    "an extrapolation of the @xmath48 curve at @xmath73 to the upper critical field @xmath41 of @xmath89 \\{@xmath90 } results in a rather high sommerfeld coefficient for @xmath1  of @xmath91 \\{@xmath8}.    the fact that we have measured a vanishingly small @xmath46 at @xmath92 and @xmath93 is of significance for the interpretation of the electronic and vibrational excitation spectrum .",
    "first , it indicates that the superconducting state affects the entire electronic system that gives rise to the large @xmath94 value [ @xmath95 to @xmath8 ] .",
    "secondly , the vibrational excitation spectrum ( at @xmath73 ) is not characterized by a glass - like spectrum ( @xmath97 ) as one might expect from a broad distribution of @xmath98-level configurations possibly associated with the particular lattice potential experienced by the k ions.@xcite    in addition to estimating the sommerfeld coefficient , measurements of the magnetic field dependent heat capacity can be helpful to reveal nodes in the gap function .",
    "it is generally thought that a square root dependence @xmath99 with @xmath100 indicates a gap with nodes , while a linear dependence @xmath101 indicates a fully gapped state.@xcite this is because the electronic excitations in the vortex state of conventional superconductors are predominantly low - energy excitations localized in the vortex core . on the other hand , the density of states for superconductors with lines of gap nodes results mostly from delocalized states outside the vortex which are located in the vicinity of the gap nodes in momentum space .",
    "we expect that the exponent in the above fit to @xmath102 versus @xmath88 tends even closer toward @xmath103 as @xmath104 , since the exponent decreases when measuring at increasingly higher temperatures ( data not shown ) .",
    "the field - dependence of the heat capacity of @xmath1  thus appears to be in line with a fully gapped state .",
    "however , since the measurements do not extend up to @xmath41 , further experimental evidence is needed to settle this point conclusively .      the specific heat for @xmath1  in various fields is shown in fig .  [ fig : deltacattc ] . in addition to the anomaly indicating the transition into the superconducting state , there are two additional peaks at @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "the origin of these peaks is unclear at this point .",
    "they are likely to be associated with the dynamics of the potassium ions in this compound .",

    "while the scattering at phonons seems to be the most plausible mechanism at this point , other scenarios for the peculiar behavior of the resistivity are also conceivable : fermi surface nesting has been found in @xmath1  and has been proposed as the driving force for strong spin fluctuations.@xcite it remains to be worked out in detail to what degree such fluctuations or even more exotic excitations could account for the measured resistivity .",
    "we note , however , that the static susceptibility of @xmath1  is not significantly enhanced ; rather it is smaller than expected based on the band density of states .    in the following we try to identify the various contributions to the measured mass enhancement reflected in the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath94",
    "it is known that coulomb and electron - phonon effects in a metal can be combined in a multiplicative fashion.@xcite an interpretation of the additional enhancement in terms of coulomb correlations would therefore mean a parametrization according to @xmath225 . in this interpretation",
    "the over - all bandwidth is reduced by a factor of @xmath226 due to electron - electron interactions .",
    "the resulting coulomb enhancement parameter @xmath125 for @xmath2  is @xmath227 and for @xmath1  it is @xmath228 \\{@xmath12 } , from which we estimate the interaction strength : assuming a conduction electron density of @xmath229 electrons per os , we can make a crude estimate of the coulomb interaction potential : @xmath230 for @xmath2  and @xmath231 \\{@xmath232 } for @xmath1 . here",
    ", @xmath233 is the density of states at the fermi level for one spin direction .",
    "both of these values indicate a large electron correlation .",
    "it is instructive to compare the @xmath17  series with a ru based @xmath16-pyrochlore series , where variations of the ru - o - ru angle results in a drastic change of the density of states .",
    "the compound y@xmath234bi@xmath235ru@xmath13o@xmath14 is a mott insulator for small @xmath236 and a normal paramagnetic metal for @xmath237 .",
    "the band sommerfeld coefficient of bi@xmath13ru@xmath13o@xmath14 is calculated to be @xmath238@xcite , resulting in a very small mass enhancement ( @xmath239 ) .",
    "the correlations increase upon y substitution resulting in an increase of the sommerfeld coefficient from about @xmath240 at @xmath241 to almost @xmath242 at @xmath243.@xcite the enhancement at @xmath244 is thus substantial : @xmath245 . below this",
    "critical value correlations become so strong that a gap opens in the density of states and the sommerfeld coefficient decreases rapidly and vanishes in the mott insulating state . using the same arguments as above for @xmath17 , the interaction potential @xmath246 in y@xmath247bi@xmath248ru@xmath13o@xmath14",
    "is of the order of @xmath249 , certainly large enough to cause a gap for a bandwidth of typically @xmath231 . at the same time",
    "the ru - o - ru angle is reduced from about @xmath250 for bi@xmath13ru@xmath13o@xmath14 to @xmath251 for y@xmath13ru@xmath13o@xmath14.@xcite this strongly indicates that a decreasing @xmath252-o-@xmath252 angle causes the band to narrow and the correlations among conduction electrons to increase .",
    "@xmath17  shows the same tendency : the os - o - os angle in @xmath2  is @xmath253 [ @xmath9 , while that for @xmath1  is @xmath254 [ @xmath7 to @xmath255 .",
    "we thus interpret the mass of @xmath17  to be increasingly enhanced by electron correlations going from @xmath123=cs to @xmath123=k .",
    "possibly the correlations are especially strong in some subband , leading to a cdw like or orbitally ordered state at around @xmath256 ( @xmath105 and @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltacattc ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with another series of pyrochlores : according to solovyev ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , a decreasing mo - o - mo angle in @xmath257mo@xmath13o@xmath14 reduces the interaction between mo(t@xmath258 ) orbitals which is mediated by o(2p ) states , causing diminishing overlap and thus enhanced mass .",
    "although this author finds the lattice parameter to be the relevant parameter determining the physics of the compound , the physical properties of various pyrochlores appear to be more appropriately parameterized by the mo - o - mo angle .",
    "an effective hubbard @xmath259 of @xmath260 is in line with other transition metals .",
    "according to @xcite , this is not enough to classify cd@xmath13os@xmath13o@xmath14 as a strongly correlated system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , a @xmath259 of @xmath261 to @xmath262 explains the mott - insulating properties of @xmath257mo@xmath13o@xmath14 very well .",
    "this might be a somewhat weak argument , because cd@xmath13os@xmath13o@xmath14 is a 5d material while @xmath257mo@xmath13o@xmath14 is 4d , which are usually more strongly correlated .",
    "on the other hand , the lda bandwidth of @xmath17  is in the region of @xmath263@xcite and the interaction potential @xmath246 is therefore comparable to @xmath264 and thus the mott - hubbard localization concept is applicable .",
    "the anomalous pressure dependence of the superconducting transition temperature is in line with these findings:@xcite hydrostatic pressure reduces the correlations working against superconductivity , thus initially increasing the critical temperature .",
    "for this reason it would be of interest to see if naos@xmath13o@xmath265 shows metallic or insulating behavior .",
    "it is enlightening to compare the electronic structure of @xmath17  to the one of oso@xmath13 , since , in a ( limited ) way , oso@xmath13 can be regarded as @xmath17  without the @xmath123 .",
    "it has a rutile structure with the oso@xmath265 octahedra sharing edges in the c direction and corners in the plane perpendicular to c.@xcite while the os - os distance to the neighboring octahedron with the shared edge and the length of the shared edge itself are shorter than the os - os and o - o distances in @xmath17 , all other os - o , o - o , and os - os distances in oso@xmath13 are slightly longer than the ones in @xmath17 .",
    "the os - o - os angles in oso@xmath13 are @xmath266 along the c axis and @xmath267 perpendicular to it .",
    "pyrochlores with a @xmath252-o-@xmath252 angle around @xmath268 usually are in an insulating state",
    ". directional resistivity measurements on oso@xmath13 could thus be quite insightful in this respect .",

    "@xcite results in a sommerfeld coefficient @xmath271 .",
    "we measure a @xmath94 of about @xmath272 , resulting in a specific heat enhancement of about @xmath273 . assuming a small electron phonon coupling in oso@xmath13 of @xmath274 and an enhancement of the form @xmath275 , this results in an enhancement due to correlations of @xmath276 .",
    "this is quite a large enhancement parameter similar to the one of @xmath17 , providing further evidence that the coulomb correlations are inherent to the os - o system .",
    "recent calculations have shown that the electronic structure does not change significantly on changing the alkali metal ion @xmath123.@xcite therefore , all these considerations point to the need to consider interactions that are not captured in the electronic structure calculations . in light of the significant electron - phonon interaction , and even stronger effects due to electron correlations , it will be of interest to further focus on the possible role played by the 3d - triangular geometry of the os - o network . in view of the strong electron correlations ,",
    "the frustrated geometry might be of importance in these materials .",
    "we take the non - superconducting state of y@xmath234bi@xmath235ru@xmath13o@xmath14 to be a clear indication that the additional enhancement mechanism is to be regarded separately from the pairing mechanism .",
    "both @xmath17  and y@xmath234bi@xmath235ru@xmath13o@xmath14 show significant enhancement due to correlations , but only @xmath17is superconducting .",
    "the question thus remains why @xmath17  is superconducting and y@xmath234bi@xmath235ru@xmath13o@xmath14 is not .",
    "the answer may lie in the electron - phonon coupling , which is unusually large in @xmath17 .",
    "we expect this to be due the @xmath0-pyrochlore instead of the @xmath16-pyrochlore structure , which leaves the 16d site empty and the 8b site occupied by @xmath123 instead of an oxygen atom .",
    "this should significantly modify the phonon spectrum , resulting in a large @xmath10 .",

    "the effective mass , even after the measured strong electron - phonon renormalization is taken into account , is threefold enhanced over the lda band mass .",

    "the renormalization affects those electrons that are paired to form the superconducting condensate . while for @xmath2  the additional heat capacity can be well characterized by an einstein model , the contribution for @xmath1  is somewhat more unusual , possibly due to strong anharmonicity .",
