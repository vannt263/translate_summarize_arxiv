    "the final state strong interactions are known to play an important role in weak nonleptonic decays . in particular ,",
    "the interplay between the strong and the weak phases is required by many signals of direct @xmath3 violation in @xmath0 decays .",
    "the presence of final state rescattering is relevant also for the extraction of the @xmath4 phases from time dependent asymmetries , and can modify the magnitude of some processes suppressed in the standard model such as @xmath5 transitions , thus reducing their sensitivity to new physics .",
    "the effect of the final state interactions ( fsi ) was assumed until recently to be small in the very energetic decays like those of @xmath0 meson to light pseudoscalar mesons , where the final particles get apart very quickly and have no time to interact strongly by soft multigluon exchanges .",
    "a related argument was based on the fact that at the high energy scale imposed by the mass of the @xmath0 meson there is a suppression of rescattering due to the specific form of the regge amplitudes dominant at this scale .",
    "recently , this qualitative picture was challenged by a more detailed dynamical approach @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the crucial remark made in @xcite is that , contrary to conventional expectations , the soft final state interactions do not disappear at the center of mass energy set by @xmath6 .",
    "the analysis made in @xcite-@xcite is based on hadronic unitarity and very general features of high energy soft interactions .",
    "consider the weak decay @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are pseudoscalar mesons , and denote by @xmath9 the amplitude of this process . in the most general way , the unitarity of the @xmath10-matrix allows one to express the discontinuity of @xmath9 as @xmath11= { 1\\over 2}\\sum_{i}\\langle p_1 p_2| { \\mathcal t}^\\dagger| i\\rangle\\langle i|{\\mathcal t}|b\\rangle \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the transition operator ( @xmath13 ) , which describes both the weak and strong interactions . to first order",
    ", the weak hamiltonian @xmath14 can appear either in the first matrix element of the product in the right hand side of ( [ unit ] ) , or in the second .",
    "the intermediate hadronic states @xmath15 depend of course on the place of @xmath14 . if @xmath14 is acting in the matrix element containing @xmath0 , @xmath15 denote hadronic states produced by the weak decay of @xmath0 and connected to the final state @xmath16 by a strong rescattering .",
    "it is this configuration of the sum ( [ unit ] ) which describes the final state interactions in @xmath0 nonleptonic decays .",
    "alternatively , the operator @xmath14 can be located in the first matrix element in the unitarity sum , in which case @xmath15 are states produced by the strong decay of @xmath0 , and connected to @xmath16 through a weak interaction . when all the particles are on - shell these terms vanish , since @xmath0 is stable with respect to strong interactions .",
    "the above remarks , though rather trivial , will be useful below for the discussion of the dispersion relations .    according to general principles",
    ", the decay amplitude @xmath9 can be obtained from its discontinuity by means of a dispersion relation .",
    "this approach was considered in @xcite-@xcite , where , neglecting possible subtractions , a dispersion relation of the following form was used @xmath17 in this relation and the similar ones written below , the limit @xmath18 is implicitly assumed .",
    "we use here the notation @xmath19 to show explicitely the dependence of the decay amplitude on the external masses . as for the discontinuity ( already divided by @xmath20 )",
    ", it was taken in @xcite-@xcite as the `` rescattering part '' of the unitarity sum ( [ unit ] ) discussed above , evaluated for an off - shell @xmath0 meson of mass squared equal to @xmath21 .",
    "the dispersion relation ( [ drel ] ) is based obviously on the analytic continuation of the decay matrix element with respect to the mass of the initial meson @xmath0 .",
    "we recall that dispersion relations in the external mass variables were derived in the frame of axiomatic field theory @xcite-@xcite , and were used in phenomenological calculations of form factors @xcite,@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "heuristic derivations of such dispersion relations are based on the lehmann , symanzik , zimmermann ( lsz ) reduction formalism @xcite , combined with causality and hadronic unitarity .",
    "as emphasized in @xcite one must be cautious in using such dispersion relations , since the heuristic conjectures might be violated , in particular through the appearance of anomalous thresholds .",
    "of interest to the present work is the fact that the specific form of the dispersion relation and of its discontinuity depends on which of the external particles is reduced in the lsz formula . by treating the matrix element of the decay @xmath22 in the frame of this formalism , one can prove that the spectral function of a dispersion relation with respect to @xmath21 ( the mass squared of the @xmath0 meson ) , like eq .",
    "( [ drel ] ) , is given _ not _ by the `` rescattering '' part of ( [ unit ] ) , as it was assumed in @xcite-@xcite , but by the second class terms in this sum .",
    "moreover , one can also prove that the terms describing the final state interaction in the unitarity sum ( [ unit ] ) appear as spectral function in a dispersion relation in terms of the mass squared of one of the final mesons ( @xmath23 or @xmath24 ) .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the whole decay amplitude from its discontinuity proceeds along a different line than that applied in refs.@xcite-@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we provide arguments for the assertions made above and consider some applications . in the next section , using the lsz formalism , we discuss the heuristic derivation of dispersion relations for the decay amplitude @xmath9 , when either @xmath0 or one of the final mesons @xmath23 or @xmath24 are off - mass shell .",
    "we do not attempt to give rigorous proofs , but only to establish the correspondence between the dispersion variable and the expression of the absorbtive part . in section 3",
    "we consider in more details the approximation of two particle unitarity combined with regge theory for strong interactions , and in section 4 we discuss some applications : first we briefly indicate how the conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite are modified by the use of the adequate dispersion relation .",
    "then , by combining the formalism with @xmath1 flavour symmetry we derive constraints on the amplitudes of the @xmath2 decay .",
    "we consider the weak decay amplitude @xmath9 defined as @xmath25 where we indicated the dependence on the lorentz invariants @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( for the physical amplitude @xmath28 ) . by applying the well known lsz formalism @xcite we `` reduce '' the particle @xmath23 , which gives @xmath29|b(p)\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] in this relation , @xmath30 denotes the source of the meson @xmath23 , defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the klein - gordon operator and @xmath33 the interpolating field ( @xmath34 , is the energy of the on shell particle @xmath23 ) .",
    "we use here and in what follows the fact that the single particle states @xmath35 and @xmath36 are identical . as shown in @xcite-@xcite , due to the factor @xmath37 the amplitude ( [ lsz1 ] )",
    "can be extended as an analytic function in the upper half of the complex plane of the time component @xmath38 .",
    "a more detailed analysis @xcite , exploiting also the causality properties of the retarded commutator and the relation @xmath39 , shows that the amplitude @xmath40 can be extended as an analytic function in the whole complex plane @xmath41 , cut along a part of the real axis , where its discontinuity is @xcite @xmath42|b(p)\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] this discontinuity coincides actually with the imaginary part @xmath43 of the decay amplitude on the upper edge of the cut ( it will be shown below that this spectral function is real ) . the r.h.s . of ( [ spectr ] )",
    "is treated in the standard way by inserting a complete set of states in the two terms of the commutator . by performing the translation @xmath44 we write ( [ spectr ] ) as @xmath45\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denoted @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the trivial integral with respect to @xmath48 gives @xmath49\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the states contributing to the first sum have the 4-momentum @xmath50 and the invariant mass @xmath51 , they correspond to what we called above the `` rescattering '' part of ( [ unit ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that this sum is nonzero for @xmath41 in the allowed interval @xmath52 ( as we mentioned anomalous thresholds might be present ) .",
    "as the second sum in ( [ spectr2 ] ) is concerned , it gives a vanishing contribution , since @xmath0 is stable with respect to the strong interactions .",
    "we recall that by the reduction formula we obtained the analytic continuation of the physical matrix element with respect to the variable @xmath41 ( the mass squared of an off - shell meson @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore , the decay amplitude can be calculated from its discontinuity by means of a dispersion relation in this external mass variable . as discussed above ,",
    "the integral extends along a finite interval , so the dispersion relation reads @xmath53 with the discontinuity given by the first sum in eq .",
    "( [ spectr2 ] ) .",
    "let us see now what is the form of the dispersion relation obtained in the lsz formalism , when the analytic continuation is done with respect to the mass squared of the @xmath0 meson . to this end , we start again from the matrix element @xmath54 , and apply the lsz formula , reducing this time the initial meson @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain @xmath55|0\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] by exploiting the causality properties of the retarded commutator one can prove @xcite that the amplitude can be extended as a real analytic function in the complex plane @xmath56 , with the discontinuity across the real axis given by @xmath57\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we obtained this result in the standard way @xcite , replacing @xmath58 in ( [ lsz2 ] ) by @xmath59 , and inserting a complete set of states in the commutator . actually , the second sum in ( [ spectrs ] ) vanishes because the only intermediate states allowed have zero 4-momentum . in the first term , the allowed particles are those connected to the final state through a weak process and to @xmath0 through a strong transition , ( we recall that the last matrix element vanishes when @xmath0 is on the mass shell ) .",
    "the lowest two particle state entering the unitarity sum is @xmath60 which defines the normal unitarity threshold .",
    "the spectral function ( [ spectrs ] ) enters a dispersion relation of the form ( [ drel ] ) with respect to @xmath56 .",
    "however , it is obvious that such a dispersion relation is not useful for estimating the rescattering effects in nonleptonic @xmath0 decays . as discussed above , in this way one does not describe the strong interactions in the final state , but rather the strong interactions in the initial state .",
    "the fact that a dispersion relation in the mass squared of the @xmath0 meson can not describe final state rescattering effects is understood by simple qualitative arguments : in order to make the analytic continuation in the variable @xmath21 we must reduce the @xmath0 meson . hence , the source @xmath61 and the weak hamiltonian @xmath62 enter different matrix elements in the unitarity sum , and terms describing the weak decay of @xmath0 multiplied by strong scattering amplitudes can not appear .",
    "therefore the procedure applied in @xcite-@xcite , based on the analytic continuation in @xmath21 combined with a discontinuity containing rescattering terms is not consistent . as we pointed out above the unitarity sum ( [ unit ] )",
    "defines the spectral function in a dispersion relation with respect to the mass variable of one of the final mesons .",
    "the relations ( [ spectr2 ] ) and ( [ direl ] ) are the main results we obtained in the frame of the standard lsz formalism .",
    "a few comments about the above formulae are of interest .",
    "first , it is clear that one can repeat the procedure by reducing the meson @xmath24 instead of @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding expressions can be obtained easily from those given above by permutting the indices 1 and 2 .",
    "the expressions seem different , but of course the results should be the same when a complete set of states is inserted in the unitarity sum .",
    "a more subtle question , which is also connected to the completeness of the set inserted in the unitarity sum is whether the discontinuity defined in ( [ spectr2 ] ) is real or complex . for @xmath63 ( or @xmath3 ) conserving interactions , the reality of the spectral function was proved a long time ago @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the absorbtive part remains real even if the relevant terms in the weak hamiltonian are not @xmath3 conserving .",
    "we take into account the fact that these terms have the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 are complex numbers and @xmath66 are products of @xmath67 and @xmath68 currents . consider the spectral function @xmath69 defined by the first sum in ( [ spectr2 ] ) , and assume that a complete set of @xmath35 states is inserted in the unitarity sum .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we can express the two matrix elements in this sum as @xmath70 and @xmath71 we used here the transformation properties of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 currents under @xmath72 and @xmath63 transformations and the fact that under space - time reversal the particles conserve their momenta , and the @xmath73 states become @xmath74 states , respectively .",
    "moreover , the intrinsic parities of the states and the operators have a product equal to @xmath75 , and the matrix element are replaced by their complex conjugates , given the antiunitary character of the operator @xmath63 . by using the relations ( [ etapt ] ) and ( [ hweakpt ] ) in ( [ spectr2 ] ) we obtain @xmath76^*= \\sigma^*(z)\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the equivalence between the complete sets of @xmath35 and @xmath36 states in the definition of @xmath77 was taken into account . from ( [ reality ] )",
    "it follows that the discontinuity is manifestly real only if the intermediate states form a complete set .",
    "if the unitarity sum is truncated , this property is lost , since various terms have complex phases which do not compensate each other in an obvious way . as noticed in @xcite , in order to maintain the proper reality condition at all stages of approximation , it is convenient to write the sum over the complete set of states @xmath78 as a combination @xmath79 .",
    "this prescription will be applied in section 4 when discussing the @xmath80 decay .",
    "in this section we write down the dispersion relation ( [ direl ] ) in the approximation that only two particle states are kept in the unitarity sum ( [ spectr2 ] ) . denoting by @xmath81 the two meson intermediate states in this sum",
    ", the off - shell imaginary part of the decay amplitude @xmath82 required in the dispersion relation ( [ direl ] ) reads @xmath83 in the sum we include the two particle states @xmath84 defining the elastic channel , as well as @xmath85 responsible for the inelastic scattering .",
    "let us note that the _ c.m .",
    "_ energy is set up by the mass of the @xmath0 meson ( @xmath86 , and the weak decay amplitudes @xmath87 are on shell , and independent on the mandelstam variable @xmath88 ( or the rescattering angle @xmath89 )",
    ". therefore eq.([disc ] ) can be written as @xmath90 where @xmath91 these coefficients depend on the masses of all the particles participating in the rescattering process . to simplify the notation",
    "we indicate explicitly only the dependence on the off shell mass squared @xmath92 of the particle @xmath23 . following",
    "@xcite-@xcite we adopt for the strong amplitudes @xmath93 the parametrizations obtained from the regge theory @xcite @xmath94 where the first sum includes @xmath95 trajectories and the second one @xmath96 trajectories . as usual",
    "we take @xmath97 and linear trajectories @xmath98 with the standard choices @xcite @xmath99 for the pomeron , and @xmath100 for all the other trajectories .",
    "the possible divergences occuring in the expression ( [ regge ] ) for @xmath101 are avoided by taking @xmath102 in the denominators .",
    "we shall therefore obtain @xmath103 as far as the regge residua @xmath104 are concerned , they are supposed to satisfy the factorization relation @xmath105 and their values at @xmath106 will be determined using the optical theorem and the phenomenological regge - like parametrizations of the total cross sections @xcite,@xcite ( details will be given in the next section ) .",
    "the @xmath88-dependence of these functions is , however , poorly known and we assume they are simply constants .    in order to perform the integral ( [ coef ] ) , the mandelstam variable @xmath88 is expressed in terms of the scattering angle @xmath89 @xmath107 with @xmath108 where we indicated explicitely only the dependence on the variable @xmath92 . with these kinematic variables",
    "the integration over the momenta @xmath109 and @xmath110 in ( [ coef ] ) is straightforward , and the coefficients @xmath111 can be expressed as @xmath112 where @xmath113 \\exp\\left[(\\alpha_{0,v}+\\alpha'_vt_0 ) \\left(\\ln { m_b^2\\over s_0}-i{\\pi\\over2}\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] @xmath114 and @xmath115 is a numerical factor equal to @xmath116 for the pomeron , @xmath117 for @xmath96 trajectories and @xmath118 for @xmath95 physical trajectories .    by inserting the expression ( [ sum ] ) of the spectral function in the dispersion relation ( [ direl ] ) and recalling that the decay amplitudes @xmath119 do not depend on @xmath92 ,",
    "we obtain ( for simplicity we omit now the mass arguments when the amplitudes are on - shell ) @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 for further use we also define @xmath123 and @xmath124 before considering applications , let us make a few comments about the approximations adopted when deriving the above formulae .",
    "first , we notice that the regge expression ( [ regge ] ) is valid for large @xmath21 and @xmath88 close to 0 .",
    "the value @xmath125 satisfies this condition , but the values of @xmath88 appearing in the integral upon the scattering angle in ( [ coef ] ) can be large , outside the range of validity of the regge theory .",
    "however , the hadronic amplitudes decrease at large @xmath126 , so the contribution of the large scattering angles in the unitarity integral is expected to be small and not very sensitive to the inaccuracy of the dynamical model .",
    "another difficulty is related to the fact that the particle @xmath23 is off shell , and its mass @xmath127 becomes very large at the upper limit of integration in the dispersion relation ( [ direl ] ) . here",
    "again , one of the assumptions for the validity of the regge expression , namely @xmath128 @xcite is not met . however ,",
    "this part of the integral , which is not correctly evaluated , brings a small contribution in the dispersion integral due to the denominator in ( [ direl ] ) ( this statement is true when the masses of the intermediate particles @xmath129 and @xmath130 are not too large ) .",
    "we emphasize that the main advantage of the formalism is that it provides , with no approximation , an algebraic relation involving only physical decay amplitudes . indeed , as we mentioned , all the quantities @xmath131 appearing in ( [ sumint ] ) are on shell , the dynamical approximations affecting only the coefficients @xmath132 .",
    "unitarity and the dispersion relations were used in previous works @xcite-@xcite in order to estimate the fsi corrections to the decay amplitudes calculated in an approximation which does not include strong rescattering ( like , for instance , factorization ) . such an evaluation was made in @xcite for the magnitude of final state interactions in @xmath134 . in the notations used in section 3",
    ", it corresponds to @xmath135 , with the intermediate states @xmath136 and @xmath137 inserted in the unitarity sum .",
    "then only physical trajectories ( @xmath138 ) contribute to ( [ regge ] ) , for which the intercept and the slope are given in ( [ alphapart ] ) .    with values of the residua extracted from the phenomenological parametrization of the cross sections the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite suggested a modification of the magnitude of the decay amplitude of the decay @xmath139 by a factor of @xmath140 .",
    "however , the coefficients @xmath132 appearing in a relation of the type ( [ sumint ] ) were calculated in @xcite by using the rescattering absorbtive function in a dispersion relation with respect to the variable @xmath21 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , eq . 2.17 ) .",
    "by performing the correct calculations with the same values of the parameters , we find that the coefficient @xmath141 , for instance , is larger by a factor of about 2.5 compared to the value reported in @xcite .",
    "this shows that the correct treatment can modify the conclusions about the magnitude of fsi in @xmath142 decays .    in the present paper we consider an other application of the dispersive formalism to the decay @xmath2 .",
    "the time dependent @xmath3 asymmetry in this decay is considered as one of the ways of extracting the angle @xmath143 of the unitarity triangle @xcite .",
    "however , the unknown strong phase difference between the tree and the penguin amplitudes of the process affects the accuracy of this determination .",
    "additional theoretical constraints on these amplitudes would be very helpful for reducing the uncertainty of the method . as we shall show below",
    ", the dispersion relations can provide such a constraint .",
    "we investigate the problem by combining the relations ( [ sum ] ) and ( [ sumint ] ) derived above with isospin or @xmath1 symmetry @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the idea is that by unitarity and dispersion relations we obtain a set of correlations between exact decay amplitudes , containing both weak and strong phases . by imposing in addition @xmath1 flavour symmetry",
    ", all the amplitudes can be expressed in terms of a small number of parameters , for which unitarity and the dispersion relations provide nontrivial constraints . following @xcite we write most generally the amplitude of the decay @xmath2 as a sum of diagram contributions @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 denote the amplitudes of the tree , penguin , exchange and penguin annihilation diagrams , respectively .",
    "we indicated explicitely the weak phases defined as @xmath149 ) and @xmath150 @xcite .",
    "as intermediate states @xmath151 in the equations ( [ disc ] ) and ( [ sumint ] ) we keep @xmath152 giving the elastic channel , as well as two meson states responsible for the soft inelastic scattering , e.g. , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( @xmath158 is the @xmath159 superposition belonging to the @xmath1 octet ) .",
    "we notice that @xmath156 will not contribute finally due to isospin conservation in the strong rescattering . of course , besides these states , other inelastic channels , like for instance multipion states can contribute .",
    "the states @xmath160 and @xmath161 are not included because they contribute to the hard scattering @xcite .    assuming su(3 )",
    "flavour symmetry we express the decay amplitudes @xmath162 of interest as @xcite-@xcite @xmath163 where @xmath145 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath147 are the same as in ( [ notation ] ) and @xmath166 denotes the amplitude of the tree colour suppressed diagrams .    due to the lack of detailed dynamical calculations ,",
    "various phenomenological assumptions are made in the literature about the above amplitudes .",
    "the conservative bound @xmath167 for the ratio of the penguin and tree amplitudes is mentioned in @xcite ( a more specific estimate @xmath168 is also quoted in this reference ) .",
    "the penguin annihilation amplitude @xmath148 correspond to ozi - suppressed diagrams @xcite , while @xmath166 and @xmath147 are colour suppresed by a factor of about @xmath169 with respect to the corresponding colour favoured amplitude .",
    "finally , the two penguin amplitudes @xmath164 and @xmath165 are assumed to satisfy @xmath170 @xcite . using these estimates , we assume as a first approximation that we can neglect in ( [ notation ] ) and ( [ notations ] ) the suppressed terms @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , keeping only the dominant amplitudes @xmath145 and @xmath164 .",
    "the next step is to introduce the decay amplitudes @xmath171 discussed above in the dispersion relation ( [ sumint ] ) .",
    "we should recall however that , due to the truncation of the unitarity sum , the imaginary part of the decay amplitude @xmath82 obtained from ( [ sumint ] ) ( or equivalently from the unitarity relation ( [ sum ] ) evaluated on - shell ) might be not real . in order to avoid this situation",
    "we apply the procedure suggested in ref.@xcite which maintains the proper reality condition of the spectral function and simulates the effect of other inelastic channels . as discussed at the end of section 2",
    ", this method amounts to insert in the unitarity sum the complete set of states @xmath172 .",
    "we recall that this method was applied to include inelastic effects through complex phases in the dispersive analysis of the electromagnetic form factors @xcite , @xcite . in our case",
    "this procedure yields , instead of ( [ sumint ] ) , the modified dispersion relation @xmath173 where @xmath132 and @xmath174 are defined in ( [ eta ] ) and ( [ bareta ] ) , respectively .",
    "we notice that eq.([sumint1 ] ) can be splitted in two relations , one for the real part and another for the imaginary part of the decay amplitude . in particular , the relation giving the imaginary part is @xmath175 and can be obtained also directly from the unitarity relation ( [ sum ] ) evaluated on shell .",
    "concerning the real part , it is obtained by taking the principal value of the dispersion integrals appearing in ( [ coefint ] ) and ( [ coefbar ] ) .",
    "we describe now briefly the determination of the regge residua @xmath176 which enters the expressions ( [ bareta ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) of the coefficients of the dispersion relation ( [ sumint1 ] ) .",
    "we use the optical theorem and the regge parametrization of the total hadronic cross - sections @xcite,@xcite , which gives @xmath177 where @xmath178 .",
    "the first term represents the pomeron contribution , the second the contributions of all the other trajectories . by comparing ( [ optical ] ) with the regge parametrization ( [ regge ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath179    for the pomeron , which contributes to the elastic @xmath152 channel , we assumed that the coupling constant is proportional to the number of quarks , taking as in @xcite @xmath180 .",
    "the residua of the physical trajectories ( which in our case are : @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) were estimated by taking into account the factorization property ( [ resid ] ) combined with the experimental data on several hadron - hadron scattering processes .",

    ".contributing trajectories to various hadronic processes .",

    ", we shall neglect in the first approximation the suppressed diagrams , keeping only the contribution of the tree and the penguin diagrams @xmath145 and @xmath164 .",

    "one can see that despite the crude approximations we made , the results are qualitatively reasonable .",
    "we notice that the equation for @xmath189 is not restrictive for the weak angles , while the expected condition @xmath198 is satisfied only for a small range above @xmath199 .",
    "however , this somewhat intriguing limitation disappears if we relax the last approximation made above , namely that the tree amplitude @xmath145 is real .",

    "our results prove that the dispersion relations written in @xcite-@xcite , based on the analytic continuation in the mass of @xmath0 , are not consistent .",
    "we derived the correct dispersion relation , and showed that it modifies the conclusions of @xcite on the magnitude of fsi effects in @xmath5 decay by a factor of approximately 2.5 .",
    "we also applied the formalism to derive a theoretical constraint for the amplitudes of the @xmath133 decay .",
    "we included in the unitarity sum a few channels , connecting them by the @xmath1 symmetry @xcite,@xcite and took into account qualitatively the effect of higher inelastic channels by a procedure applied in the study of the electromagnetic form factors @xcite , @xcite . in spite of the various dynamical assumptions mentioned in the text our results ( [ final2 ] ) for the ratio @xmath188 and the strong relative phase @xmath189 of the penguin and tree amplitudes in terms of the weak angles ( represented in figs .",
    "[ fi : phase ] and [ fi : ratio ] ) are qualitatively reasonable .",
    "as we mentioned , these results can be immediately modified to incorporate a nonzero strong phase for the tree amplitude .",
    "also , the contributions of the suppresed diagrams neglected in the present analysis , as well as corrections to the exact @xmath1 symmetry , can be easily included in the dispersion formalism .",
    "a more complete analysis will be made in a future work .",
    "the results might be useful as additional constraints in the extraction of the angles of the unitarity triangle from the time dependent @xmath3 asymmetry in the decay @xmath133 .",
