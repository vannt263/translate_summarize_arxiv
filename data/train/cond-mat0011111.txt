    "we gave analytical expressions for the quantitative evaluation of the processes that take place in nis junctions , which are valid in the range of low temperatures .",
    "the validity of these formulae can be checked by the evaluation of the lower order terms in the quantities @xmath266 ( see the definitions in section [ general ] ) . using the analytical expressions we showed that in the limit of low temperature of the electron gas in the normal metal ( @xmath1 ) the difference between the gap energy in the superconductor , @xmath196 , and the bias voltage corresponding to the maximum cooling power , @xmath195 ( supposing that the temperature of the superconductor does not vary with the bias voltage ) , is independent of @xmath196 and scales with @xmath1 , like @xmath267 .",
