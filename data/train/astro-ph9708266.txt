    "in a previous paper @xcite , quashnock , vanden berk , & york analyzed line  of  sight correlations of  and  absorption  line systems on large scales , using an extensive catalog @xcite  of 2200 heavy  element absorption  line systems in over 500 qso spectra . here , we extend that analysis to smaller comoving scales  from 1 to 16   and relate the small  scale clustering of absorbers to galaxy clustering in general .",
    "the  and  data sample is drawn from the catalog of vanden berk  @xcite , using the same selection criteria as those in @xcite .",
    "it consists of 260  absorbers , drawn from 202 lines of sight , with redshifts ranging from @xmath11 and mean redshift @xmath0 , and 64  absorbers , drawn from 278 lines of sight , with redshifts ranging from @xmath12 and mean redshift @xmath1 .    unless otherwise noted , we take @xmath5 and @xmath13 .",
    "we follow the usual convention and take the hubble constant to be 100@xmath14  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 . a more detailed version of this work , including more results and outlining our maximum  likelihood method , has appeared elsewhere @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows the line  of  sight correlation function @xmath16 , for the entire sample of  absorbers ( with mean redshift @xmath0 ) , as a function of absorber comoving separation @xmath17 from 1 to 16 , in 4 octaves .",
    "the vertical error bars through the data points are 1-@xmath18 errors in the estimator for @xmath19 .",
    "the correlation function and error bars are computed in the same fashion and using the same selection criteria as those in @xcite , except that we have combined all absorbers lying within 1.0 ( instead of 3.5 ) comoving  of each other into a single system .    using the maximum  likelihood method of @xcite",
    ", we find that , for the  sample as a whole , the line  of  sight correlation function is well described by a power law of the form @xmath2 , with maximum  likelihood values of @xmath3 and comoving correlation length @xmath4  ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the clustering of absorbers at high redshift is thus of the _ same form _ as that found for galaxies and clusters at low redshift ( @xmath20 for galaxies @xcite , @xmath21 for clusters @xcite ) , and of amplitude such that absorbers are correlated on scales of clusters of galaxies .",
    "it appears that the absorbers are tracing the large  scale structure seen in the distribution of galaxies and clusters , and are doing so at high redshift .",
    "the finding strengthens the case for using absorbers in probing large  scale structure .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of the clustering of absorbers by dividing the  absorber sample into three approximately equal redshift sub  samples , and comparing these to the  sample .",
    "figure  2 shows the mean of the correlation function , @xmath6 , averaged over comoving scales @xmath17 from 1 to 16 , for the low ( @xmath22 ) , medium ( @xmath23 ) , and high ( @xmath24 ) redshift  sub  samples , as well as for the  sample ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the correlation function is clearly growing _ rapidly _ with decreasing redshift .",
    "we have used the maximum  likelihood formalism of @xciteto describe the evolution of the correlation function . we have fixed @xmath26 at its maximum  likelihood value of 1.75 in our analysis , and parametrized the amplitude of the correlation function in the usual manner as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the evolutionary parameter @xcite . using all the data sets",
    ", we find that the rapid growth is reflected in a large value for the evolutionary parameter , namely @xmath29 .",
    "this value is 3.3-@xmath18 from the no  evolution value ( @xmath30 ) ; thus , at the 99.95 % confidence level , growth of the correlation function has been detected .",
    "( these results are with @xmath5 . with @xmath31",
    ", we expect our estimate of @xmath28 to decrease by about 1.3 . )",
    "the rapid growth in the correlation function , and the correspondingly large value of the evolutionary parameter ( @xmath29 ) that is implied , is what is expected in a critical universe ( @xmath32 ) , both from linear theory of gravitational instability @xcite , with @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 , if @xmath35 ) , and from numerical simulations @xcite : for @xmath32 , @xmath36 , whereas for @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "evidence for a trend of increasing clustering of ly@xmath39 absorbers ( @xmath40 ) with decreasing redshift has been found by cristiani  @xcite .",
    "these authors also find a clear trend of increasing ly@xmath39 absorber clustering with increasing column density , and find that an extrapolation to column densities typical of heavy  element systems ( @xmath41 ) is consistent with the clustering observed for  absorbers @xcite .",
    "our finding of growth in the clustering of heavy  element systems with decreasing redshift supports both a continuity scenario between ly@xmath39 and heavy  element systems @xcite , and the common action of gravitational instability .",
    "the strong clustering that we find in the heavy  element absorption  line systems is thus not surprising , given that most of the sample consists of the strongest systems with relatively large equivalent widths ( order 0.4   and greater ) , and the recent claims @xcite  of a strong dependence of clustering strength on the column density of the systems .",
    "we do confirm that the weaker systems ( equivalent widths 0.2   and less ) are less clustered than the stronger ones , by a factor of two or so ; unfortunately , most of the spectra used to assemble the vanden berk  catalog @xcite  are not of sufficient quality to yield a large number of weak systems ."
