    "the two galaxies studied in this paper have been previously imaged in a broad far - uv band ( @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath0 1521 ) by the _ ultraviolet imaging telescope _ ( uit ) .",
    "the uit data were analysed by kuchinski et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , waller et al . 1997 ( m101 ) , hill et al . 1997 ( m51 ) , hoopes , walterbos , & bothun ( 2001 ) . while the uit fuv images revealed morphological differences with respect to the optical bands , and the brightest stellar complexes , the galex data yield significant advances",
    ". first , both fuv and nuv bands are available , providing an essentially reddening - free color which gives a direct indication of the age ( for compact sources ) independent of the extinction estimate , while the uv - to - optical wide baseline is very sensitive to both extinction and age ( sect .",
    "second , galex s detectors afford greater sensitivity and linearity than the uit data ( which were recorded on film ) , measuring uv emission out to larger disk radii , and down to fainter ( by about 3 mag ) fluxes ( sect .",
    "the galex instrument is described by martin et al .",
    "( 2004 , this issue ) and its on - orbit performance by morrissey et al .",
    "( 2004 , this issue ) .",
    "galex fuv ( 13501750   ) and nuv ( 17502750   ) imaging was obtained with total exposure times of 1414 and 1041 sec for m51 and m101 .",
    "assuming distances of 9.6 mpc , and 7.4 mpc ( m51 : sandage & tammann 1974 , m101 : kelson et al .",
    "1996 ) the @xmath3  fwhm galex psf corresponds to 209 , and 157 pc .",
    "the 1-@xmath4 ( at the psf scale ) nuv(fuv ) sensitivity limit of the galex images is 27.9 ( 27.8 ) ab mag @xmath5 for m51 and 27.6 ( 27.5 ) ab mag @xmath5 for m101 .",
    "we also used sdss imaging of m51 and m101 in the _ ugriz _ filters .",
    "the resolution of the optical data ( 1 - 2@xmath6 , @xmath0 70 and 50 pc for m51 and m101 respectively ) is superior to that of galex , and in some cases the galex uv sources are resolved into two or three optical sources .",
    "the different angular resolutions were taken into account when matching the uv and optical sources .",
    "for the analysis in sect .",
    "3 , we focus on the smallest scale detections in each galaxy , thus sampling the star forming complexes in m101 and m51 on a scale corresponding to the galex resolution .",
    "post - pipeline processing and photometry on the galex and sdss images were performed using the sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and iraf apphot packages . to obtain our master list of `` point - like '' sources we first ran sextractor on the nuv imagery after removal of the diffuse background , using a detection kernel matched to the galex nuv psf ( 4.6@xmath6 ) .",
    "the background was estimated using a circular median - filter of diameter 10.5@xmath6 ( 7 pixels ) .",
    "such background removal is crucial in order to obtain a complete sextractor catalog in bright regions of m51 and m101 .",
    "we then passed this list of compact nuv sources to the apphot package , running phot ( with recentering enabled ) on background subtracted versions of the galex fuv , nuv , and convolved sdss images .",
    "sources which shifted in position by more than 4@xmath6 in any band were eliminated .",
    "finally , phot was used to measure fluxes for all surviving compact sources with 4@xmath6 aperture radius , and aperture corrections based on isolated field stars were applied .",
    "figures [ foverlay101 ] and [ foverlay51 ] show the galex nuv image for the two galaxies .",
    "the matched sources with photometric errors better than 0.2  mag in the uv bands are shown .",
    "table [ tlimits ] gives the number of detected sources in each band and the statistics of sources for given error limits .",
    "the final matched catalog was based on the nuv source list ( the deepest uv band ) , and includes only nuv sources having a counterpart in at least one other band .",
    "the photometry procedures were verified by comparing our results with both galex and sdss pipeline photometry on portions of the same images outside the galaxy body , where the standard pipeline results are reliable .",
    "we found complete consistency within the errors .",
    "we applied our photometry technique in the regions containing the galaxies , where the standard galex and sdss pipelines break down .",
    "we use the flux calibration from the galex internal release version 0.2 .",
    "the measured colors for the compact uv sources in m101 were compared to synthetic colors computed from the bruzual and charlot ( 2003 ) models for integrated populations , for the cases of single burst ( hereafter ssp ) and of continuous star formation ( hereafter csp ) , as a function of age . as expected ( because we are sampling uv - bright compact complexes ) most sources are better represented by a ssp sed . in this work",
    "we assume solar metallicity and a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf ( mass range 0.1 - 100 ) . because the uv sources are mostly very young complexes , the analysis is not very sensitive to metallicity .",
    "for instance , the -color of a ssp model with solar metallicity for 1 , 10 , and 100 myrs is -= -0.35 , -0.06 , 0.18 ( in the ab mag system ) .",
    "the model colors for the same ages at z=0.008 differ by @xmath70.1 , which leads to an uncertainty in the age by up to a factor of 3 , and typically by @xmath72 , depending on the age . according to the hii regions study by kennicutt , bresolin , & garnett ( 2003 ) ,",
    "solar metallicity is appropriate out to @xmath06@xmath8 , which includes the majority of our sources .",
    "figure [ fcolcol ] shows color - color diagrams of the sources compared to the models .",
    "we derived physical parameters by comparing the measured magnitudes to the model colors . because the observed sed s depend on the cluster age ( intrinsic sed ) and on the wavelength - dependent interstellar extinction , we reddened the model colors for different amounts of extinction and reddening types .",
    "two different methods were used , and the results compared . in the first method , we used the galex measurements alone , and estimated the cluster ages by comparing the -color to the models .",
    "reddening has a negligible effect on the -color , for e(b - v ) values associated with these galaxies .",
    "for instance , model colors for e(b - v)=0.2 ( mw - type extinction , r@xmath9=3.1 ) differ from the unreddened colors by @xmath7 0.01 , up to 100myrs . in the second method",
    ", we fit all the measured multi - band magnitudes with the synthetic colors to derive age and e(b - v ) concurrently , by @xmath10@xmath11 minimization , taking into account the photometric errors in each band ( see bianchi et al .",
    "2004 in prep . , for more details ) .",
    "ages determined from the -color , and by the sed fit of the uv - to - optical bands respectively , agree for most of the sources within the errors , but are discrepant for some sources , where a color gradient may be present .",
    "we adopt the age from the sed fits , which represents the average over the area included in the aperture , for the sources with errors @xmath120.05 - 0.10  mag ( sdss and galex bands respectively ) .",
    "these ages are shown in the green - dashed histogram in figure [ fage ] , and ages derived by the -color only ( for the uv sources with and errors @xmath120.2 mag ) are shown by the blue ( solid ) histogram . this sample ( about 1100 sources )",
    "includes a large number of ( mostly younger ) sources eliminated by the error cuts in the sed - fit sample .",
    "we note that individual errors in the ages derived by the -color in the range of log age ( in yrs ) = 6.5 - 7.5 may be larger than the bin - size , as -does not vary appreciably in this range . for this reason , and for the selection effects limiting the sources with good sed fits , we do not attempt to interpret this histogram in terms of star - formation history .",
    "we point out however the great sensitivity of the galex uv imaging to detect and measure the youngest sources .",
    "the sharp decline in the number of sources at older ages is mostly due to our magnitude limits and color selection effect .",
    "however , disruption may be more effective for these large - scale complexes than for bound clusters .",
    "once reddening and age are determined for each complex , the reddening - corrected luminosity and age yield the current ( and thus the initial ) mass , by comparison with the same models ( figure [ fage ] , lower panel ) .",
    "figure [ fage ] also shows the cluster sample detected in one hst wfpc2 field with @xmath13 measurements by chandar et al .",
    "( 2004 , in preparation ) in m101 .",
    "given the higher spatial resolution , the hst photometry samples bound stellar clusters , while our galex census samples the star forming complexes on spatial scales of @xmath14 160  pc . for m51 we do not perform a similar analysis given the smaller number of compact sources detected , and distortion of the images which limits the accuracy of compact sources photometry .",
    "in summary , the galex images provided a complete census of young , compact star - forming complexes .",
    "the uv bands are extremely sensitive to young stellar populations .",
    "e.g. , the [ intrinsic ] -@xmath15 ( @xmath0 -v ) colors of clusters ( ssp ) with ages of 1 , 10 , 100 myrs are -1.78 , -0.30 , 1.11 ( ab mag ) , while the @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) [ approximately b - v ( u - b ) ] colors are -0.49 , 0.06 , -0.03 ( -0.39 , 0.01 , 0.69 ) . thus by including galex measurements we gain a finer resolution for parameters of young associations and complexes , hence a clearer , unbiased census of recent star formation .",
    "figure [ fage ] indicates that sf in m101 occured over the last 10@xmath18 yrs , both in stellar clusters ( chandar et al . 2004 ) and in larger complexes ( galex results , this paper ) .",
    "this analysis will be extended to other resolved galaxies in the galex ngs , to compare their cluster systems and star - formation histories .",
    "to explore the average properties of the stellar population as a function of galactocentric distance , we computed radial profiles of the and median surface brightness for each galaxy within concentric elliptical annuli , oriented in accordance with the galaxy inclination and position angle ( m101 : i=18@xmath19 , pa=39@xmath19 , bosma et al .",
    "1981 ; m51 : i=20@xmath19 , pa=170@xmath19 , rots et al .",
    "1990 ) . within each annulus we measured the median surface brightness ( thus removing the discrete peaked sources , and the foreground stars ) and subtracted an average sky background , determined in a wide elliptical annulus exterior to the galaxy .",
    "in figure [ fradprof ] we plot the surface brightness as a function of radius in the two galex bands , as well as the -color .",
    "values of this color for ssp and csp models are indicated for a range of ages . as shown previously , this color is essentially reddening - free , thus gives a direct indication of the age .",
    "observed colors are redder than csp models for a wide range of ages , across most of the galaxy , excluding this scenario .",
    "ssp models represent the extreme opposite of the csp scenario , and ssp ages have only indicative value , since we are comparing colors of azimuthally averaged populations , and single bursts of star formation ( clusters , associations ) would likely be localized .",
    "the ssp ages indicate a more recent star - formation activity towards outer regions ( spanning two dex in age ) for m101 , and much less conspicuous fluctuations in m51 , while the bulge has an older ( average ) age . the comparison of figure [ fradprof ] with the fuv radial profile from uit data ( kuchinski et al .",
    "2000 ) shows the advantage of the galex measurements .",
    "in addition to providing the -color , for both m101 and m51 the profiles in figure [ fradprof ] extend to larger galactocentric radii , sampling outer disk areas , about 3 magnitudes fainter than the uit data ( note again that we use ab magnitudes , which differ from the uit magnitude system - for - by @xmath0 2.8 mag ) .",
    "the radial profiles of the -color in the local group galaxies m  33 and m  31 , and in m83 , ( thilker et al , 2004a , b this issue ) show the same trend of the -color becoming bluer outwards , the magnitude of the color gradient differing from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "an extensive comparison among a representative sample of nearby galaxies will follow in a forthcoming paper .",
