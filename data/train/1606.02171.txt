    "four score and a year ago yukawa brought forth a new theory of nuclear forces and dedicated to the proposition that protons and neutrons exchange pions  @xcite . but created and anihilated pions are all not equal .",
    "the quest for isospin violations in particle and nuclear physics has been a permanent goal ever since kemmer  @xcite invented the concept and generalized the pauli principle .",
    "a readable account of the early developpments can be found in ref .",
    "actually , the neutral pion was sought and found because isospin symmetry required it . while the mass of the pion may be deduced directly from their decays @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath7 the determination of the coupling constant to nucleons is more intrincate and needs further theoretical ellaboration .",
    "although this is not a fundamental constant of qcd , the pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling constant is the strong hadronic charge of neutrons and protons , which appear as the effective constituents of atomic nuclei .    in 1940",
    "bethe obtained the value @xmath8 from the study of deuteron properties  @xcite .",
    "subsequent determinations based on a variety of processes can be traced from recent compilations  @xcite .",
    "attempts to make a microscopic distinction via radiative vertex corrections aiming at predictive power have been made in the past ( see @xcite for pre - qcd account ) . at the hadronic level and within the meson exchange picture",
    "there have been many attempts to determine the many possible causes of isospin breaking , @xmath9 and @xmath10 mixing , pion mass differences in the two - pion exchange interaction , @xmath11 exchange , etc .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for post qcd comprehensive accounts ) .",
    "all these many complications contribute to the belief that isospin violations in strong interactions remains one of the least understood issues in the nuclear force .    in this contribution",
    "we provide our point of view on this subject and the elements underlying ongoing work on the determination of the three coupling constants .",
    "although many of the issues we address here are well known for the experts after 60 years of nn partial wave analysis fits , we try in this short account to be pedagogical for the non - experts . for comprehensive and concise reviews",
    "we suggest ref .",
    "@xcite where the latest nn based determination @xmath12 is recommended .",
    "the coupling constant is rigurously defined as the @xmath13 three point vertex function when all three particles are on the mass shell , a condition that can not generally be satisfied for real momenta . at the hadronic level",
    "the pion - nucleon - nucleon vertex is described by the lagrangian ( we use the standard convention  @xcite ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are antibaryon , baryon and pseudoscalar meson field respectively and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are dirac matrices .",
    "this yields four possible vertices @xmath20 so their amplitudes are , @xmath21 and so on . the relevant relationships between the pseudoscalar pion coupling constants , @xmath22 , and the pseudovector ones , @xmath23 , are given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 mev the proton mass , @xmath26 mev the neutron mass , and @xmath27 mev the mass of the charged pion . from these vertices",
    "one may obtain the nn scattering amplitude to lowest order in perturbation theory , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pinn - ope ] . for instance ,",
    "the unpolarized differential nn - cross section reads @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\   & + & ( u \\leftrightarrow t ) \\ , ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath32 the cm momentum and scattering angle respectively .",
    "this is perhaps the most straightforward way of checking ope from data , i.e. extrapolating @xmath33 from the physical @xmath34 kinematics to the unphysical limit @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , the born approximation violates elastic unitarity and there are many ways to restore it . for reasons to be explained below we use the phenomenological potential approach and a partial wave expansion analysis  @xcite .",
    "the concept of a potential is essentially non - relativistic and the procedure to obtain it is to match perturbatively the non - relativistic quantum mechanical potential to the same scattering amplitude obtained in quantum field theory for the direct term , namely @xmath36 where the on - shell condition is understood @xmath37 .",
    "this already incorporates an ambiguity , since one may add terms which vanish on the mass - shell . in the static limit of heavy nucleons the ambiguity dissapears and the potential deduced from field theory becomes local , which is of great advantage since we obtain a schrdinger equation .",
    "the cd - ope potential in the pp and np channels so obtained reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 \\",
    ", , \\ ] ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 the single nucleon pauli matrices and @xmath43 the tensor operator . using the standard notation",
    "we make the identifications @xmath44 in many derivations of the ope potential some emphasis is placed on the contact and singular piece which is proportional to a dirac delta function located at the origin .",
    "we omit them here , since they will play no role in our subsequent discussion .",
    "the saturation property of nuclei suggests that there is an equilibrium distance between two nucleons .",
    "while one talks about nuclear forces , the truth is that they have never been measured directly in experiment . from a purely classical viewpoint",
    ", this would require to pull two nucleons apart at distances larger than their size and measure the necessary force , similarly as coulomb and cavendish did for the electric and gravitational forces 250 years ago .",
    "for such an ideal experiment the behaviour of the system at shorter distances would be largely irrelevant .",
    "this situation would naturally occurr if nucleons were truely infinitely heavy sources of baryon charge . from a fundamental point of view",
    "the nucleon force is defined from the static energy between two nucleons which in qcd are made of three quarks and any number of quark - antiquark pairs and gluons .",
    "nucleons and pions are composite and extended particles which can be characterized by any gauge invariant combination of interpolating fields with the proper quantum numbers .",
    "this generates some ambiguity except for heavy quarks . in any case",
    "the static energy reads @xmath45 here , the quarks in each nucleon are located at the same point @xmath46 and @xmath47 . on the lattice",
    "static baryon sources have been placed at a fixed distance  @xcite , and in fact there exist lattice calculations addressing the pion - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "momentum dependence of the strong form factor and coupling constant determination in lattice qcd gives @xmath48  @xcite and more recently @xmath49 for @xmath50 @xcite using qcd sum rules . on the lattice in the quenched approximation",
    "it has been found that for a pion mass of @xmath51 mev the value @xmath52 which is encouraging  @xcite .",
    "these are courageous efforts which still are far from the @xmath53 accuracy needed for witnessing isospin breaking in the couplings ( see below ) .",
    "some intuition may be gathered from a chiral quark model picture . at scales above the confinement radius",
    "we expect exchange of purely hadronic states and at long distances the ope mechanism will dominate  @xcite , but because the quarks in each nucleon are on top of each other , they will contribute coherently to the couplings .",
    "of course ,",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 quarks are not heavy , but spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking will provide them with a constituent mass @xmath56 which will give a total mass @xmath57 .",
    "thus , neglecting em contributions , the proton and neutron masses are @xmath58 and @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 , a reasonable value . within this picture ,",
    "relative corrections @xmath61 at the nucleon or quark level are the same . the @xmath62 coupling is the residue of the bethe - salpeter equation at the pion pole . in a model",
    "where the pion is composite such as the njl model ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) one has for @xmath63 ( @xmath64 is the njl cut - off ) @xmath65 with @xmath66 so the coupling to the pion grows with the quark mass .",
    "unfortunately we can not carry out the classical cavendish experiment for nucleons in the laboratory .",
    "we may instead analyze the about 8000 pp and np scattering data collected in accelerators below lab energy @xmath68 in the period 1950 - 2013 .",
    "quantum mechanically wave - particle duality implies a finite wavelength resolution for a given relative momentum , @xmath69 .",
    "this will allow to sample the potential at coarse grained distance scales , @xmath70 .",
    "fluctuations of the interaction below that scale will be unobservable and manifest as correlations among the interaction at the sampled points @xmath71 .",
    "the `` force '' is defined as the average change of @xmath71 over the resolution scale @xmath72 , for instance @xmath73 .",
    "the nn scattering amplitude has five independent complex components which are a function of energy and scattering angle , @xmath74 we use the three unit vectors ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 are relative final and initial momenta ) , @xmath77 for this amplitude the partial wave expansion in this case reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the unitary coupled channel s - matrix , and the @xmath80 are clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "one has that @xmath81 with @xmath82 a hermitian coupled channel matrix ( also known as the k - matrix ) . at the level of partial waves",
    "the multipion exchange diagrams generate left hand cuts in the complex s - plane , which come in addition to the nn elastic right cut and the @xmath13 , @xmath83 etc .",
    ", pion production cuts . at low energies for @xmath84 which is the coupled channels effective range expansion .",
    "we sketch the situation in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlab - complex ] ( left panel ) where a possible contour for a dispersion relations study is also depicted . when the cuts are explicitly taken into account there still remains the question on the number of subtraction constants ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "while one can pursue such an analysis , comparison with experimental data goes beyond just partial waves and generates complications coming from long range effects , which are most efficiently treated in coordinate space within the potential approach preferred by nuclear physicists .",
    "the magnetic moment interaction which decreases as @xmath85 is crucial to describe the data but remains a challenge in momentum space . even in the friendly coordinate space",
    "these terms usually need summing about 1000 - 2000 partial waves .",
    "this is a serious bottleneck for any analysis aiming at a direct comparison to experimental data .",
    "fortunately , any pion cut generates a contribution to the potential which at long distances falls off as @xmath86 .",
    "the potential in coordinate space , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : tlab - complex ] ( right panel ) , has the same analytical structure ( left panel ) but permits incorporating these otherwise difficult long distance effects by simply solving the schrdinger equation and using the sampled , coarse grained potential @xmath71 , as fitting parameters themselves .",
    "one motivation to study the nn force is to apply it to nuclear structure and nuclear reactions .",
    "many studies are conducted with this application in mind , when not specifically designed to produce a potential friendly to some preferred computational many - body method .",
    "this introduces a bias and hence a systematic error in the analysis of nuclear forces which is often forgotten   .",
    "thus , fits rarely go much beyond the pion production region , since the inelastiticy becomes important above 350 mev lab energy and the addition of @xmath13 channel does not improve the description .",
    "on the other hand , being composite particles made out of quarks and gluons , nucleons have a finite size which can be determined by a variety of methods , mostly by electron and neutrino scattering .",
    "to what extent this finite size is relevant for nuclear structure calculations is not completely obvious , but in practice nucleons in nuclear physics are treated as elementary and pointlike .",
    "excitations such as the @xmath87 resonance are explicitly included themselves as elementary point like particles as well .",
    "the most dense known nuclear system is nuclear matter where an average equilibrium separation distance between nucleons is @xmath88fm .",
    "thus , nuclear binding is obviously related to this mid - range distance . on the other hand the pion production threshold happens at lab energy @xmath89 .",
    "an extreme situation corresponds to assume that the elementarity radius @xmath90 is arbitrarily small .",
    "the lightest nucleus , the deuteron , is a bound np system with @xmath91 , and corresponds to a @xmath92 mixed state . the tensor part of the ope potential diverges as @xmath85 as already pointed out by bethe  @xcite .",
    "thus , the deuteron equations are singular at short distances , but they can be renormalized  @xcite by imposing physical renormalization conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pinn - ope - deuteron ] we show results for a number of renormalized observables and _ requiring _ the state to be normalizable at short distances , showing that @xmath93 , not far from bethe s venerable value .",
    "the elementarity size @xmath90 of the nucleon can operationally be characterized by looking at departures from point - like behaviour . if we look for instance at the electromagnetic interaction , fig .",
    "[ fig : vlong ] ( left panel ) , it clearly suggests that protons interact as point - like charges , @xmath94 , above @xmath95 .",
    "the electric charge screening feature we see in the electromagnetic case also holds for the strong interaction but here , it corresponds to axial charge screening .",
    "this can be illustrated within a quark cluster picture using a chiral quark model  @xcite . at long distances",
    "one can determine the nn potential in the born - oppenheimer approximation , allowing for @xmath87 isobar intermediate states , but include the @xmath96 transition form factor .",
    "in the chiral quark model , where pcac holds the vertices @xmath13 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are proportional to the axial form factors , for which we may use axial - vector meson dominance  @xcite .",
    "this provides a dominating contribution to the two pion exchange ( tpe ) for @xmath99 . the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : born - oppen ] and , as we see , the elementarity radius turns out , again , to be about @xmath100 the average distance of nucleons in nuclear matter , suggesting that nucleon compositeness should be play a marginal role in nuclei .",
    "+    the quark model estimate suggests that we may pin down the interaction as if nucleons were elementary particles down to the elementarity radius @xmath101 .",
    "the practical utility of this informaton is that we can compare different contributions stemming from meson exchange _ above _ the elementarity radius @xmath90 , showing that ( unregularized ) ope is the main contribution for distances larger than a cut - off scale @xmath102 below which tpe starts contributing significantly .",
    "this pattern occurs also with the exchange of heavier mesons including @xmath103 etc . which allows us to discard them in our analysis as well as tpe .",
    "in fact , one common feature of all the high quality interactions is that they contain unregularized ope above 3 fm .",
    "thus , we will take @xmath104    until 1993 most `` high quality fits '' carried out by many groups in bonn , paris washington and nijmegen never improved over a @xmath105 . from the point of view of statistical analysis",
    "this is undesirable ; one finds the closest theory to experiment but the difference between theory and experiment can not be identified as a random fluctuation , precluding any sensible error analysis .",
    "the great achievement of the nijmegen group in the 1990 s was to pursue all effects which could explain the very accurate pp and np measurements .",
    "besides coulomb this includes three main effects : vacuum polarization ( vp ) , relativistic corrections and magnetic moments ( mm ) interactions .",
    "for instance vp dominates over mm for @xmath106fm whereas beyond the effect is the opposite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : vlong ] .",
    "the em piece becomes , @xmath107    as mentioned before we can not pin down details below @xmath108 , so we explicitly coarse grain the interaction in the innermost unknown region , which means in practice sampling the `` unknown '' original potential at equidistant values separated by a distance @xmath109 , @xmath110 , using dirac delta - shells .",
    "this was an idea suggested by aviles long ago  @xcite and rediscovered recently  @xcite which means @xmath111 where @xmath112 become the fitting parameters which depend on the resolution scale @xmath72 and whose total number can be estimated _ a priori _  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by inspecting fig .",
    "[ fig : tlab - complex ] ( right panel ) by counting how many partial waves and how many points @xmath113 per partial wave sample the interaction with resolution @xmath72 .",
    "this viewpoint provides a rationale for the number of parameters , @xmath114 , ( typically about 40 - 50 ) that were traditionally needed in the past for high quality fits and allows at the same time the most succesful pp and np fit to date .",
    "fitting and selecting data are intertwined , particularly when there are incompatible data , as it is the case in nn scattering .",
    "we have collected @xmath115 np+pp scattering data , @xmath116 , measured between 1950 and 2013 below @xmath117 , with given experimental uncertainty @xmath118 .",
    "on the other hand the nn potential @xmath119 will generate @xmath120 , and we can minimize the distance between theory and experiment by tuning the fitting parameters , the potential at the coarse grained distances , @xmath121_{l , l'}^{js}$ ] , and the pion - nucleon coupling constants @xmath122 .    even in the case of mutually consistent data , we can never be sure that the phenomenological theory is correct , so one poses the classical ( and admittedly twisted ) statistical question as follows : assuming that the theory is correct , what is the probability @xmath123 that the data are _ not _ described by the theory ? .",
    "this corresponds to find the probability that for the measured observables , we _ can not _ say that the true values fulfill the relation @xmath124 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 are independent random _ normal _ variables with vanishing mean value @xmath127 and unit variance @xmath128 , implying that @xmath129 .",
    "if this probability is large then we can discard the phenomenological theory and look for a better one .",
    "but if it turns out to be small , there is no good reason to discard it , and moreover we can vary the parameters in such a way that they cover the fluctuations in the data .",
    "the p - value is @xmath130 and determines the confidence level we have on the theory .",
    "this is the standard set up for the @xmath131 least square fitting , since the sum of @xmath132-gaussians , @xmath133 has a @xmath131-distribution with @xmath132-degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , one can only check this assumption _ after _ the optimal fit has been carried out , and determining whether the outcoming residuals , @xmath134 belong to a gaussian distribution as we initially assumed . if this is the case the fit is self - consistent .",
    "the most popular @xmath131-test provides a @xmath135-value of @xmath136 when @xmath137 where @xmath138 . in previous works we extensively discuss more stringent tests as well as the conditions allowing a legitimate global scaling of errors  @xcite .",
    "one important issue here is the role played by the number of fitting parameters , which we claim to be optimally fixed by the maximum scattering lab energy . obviously , if we have too few parameters a successfull fit will not be acomplished  . on the other hand , although there is no limit in principle to include more parameters , we expect strong correlations among them which display explicitly a undesirable parameter redundancy and no real fit improvement  . in our case",
    "we found about 50 parameters to be realistic and with moderate correlations  @xcite .",
    "all this is fine provided we have a collection of mutually compatible data .",
    "when this is not the case , we may ask which experiment or datum including its error estimate is correct @xmath139 .",
    "this may not necessarily mean genuinely wrong experiments , but rather unrealistic error estimates .",
    "note that the main purpose of a fit is to determine the true values of certain parameters with a given and admissible confidence level , so we search for a maximization of experimental consensus by excluding data sets inconsistent with the rest of the database _ within _ the fitting model .",
    "we extend the nijmegen @xmath5 criterion  @xcite by the following selection process :    1 .",
    "fit to all data .",
    "if @xmath140 you can stop . if not proceed further .",
    "2 .   remove data sets with improbably high or low @xmath131 ( 3@xmath141 criterion ) 3 .",
    "refit parameters for the remaining data .",
    "4 .   re - apply @xmath5 criterion to all data 5 .",
    "repeat until no more data are excluded or recovered    the effect of the selection criterion is to go from @xmath142 to @xmath143 with a reduction in the number of data from @xmath144 to @xmath145 . while this seems a drastic rejection of data it allows to perform the largest self - consistent fit to date below 350 mev",
    "for such a large number of data this is _ not _ a minor improvement ; it makes the difference between having @xmath146 or @xmath147 .    in the process of selecting and fitting",
    "we have learned some features of the phenomenological interaction within the coarse grained aproach where no _ a priori _ condition on the fitting parameters was imposed .",
    "we can fit the pp database independently .",
    "however , the isovector phases in the pn system are largely uncontrolled by the np data .",
    "therefore it is preferable to fit the pp first , and to refit the pp+np system simultaneously by making some statistically testable isospin assumptions .",
    "we have also tried to use normality of the residuals as a rejection tool , without much success .",
    "the reason is that a normality test checks the excess or deficit of residuals as compared to the guess distribution , but does not indicate specifically which data are responsible for normality deviations .",
    "likewise , we have analyzed the robustness of the database with respect to restricting or enlarging the rejection level from @xmath5 to @xmath148 or @xmath149 , respectively . in the first case , it was not possible to find a self - consistent database with the number of accepted data fluctuating from subsequent fits .",
    "this is probably related to the grouping of data in a common experiment , preventing a stable decision of accepting / rejecting data groups . in the @xmath149-rejection level case ,",
    "the self - consistent database exists but does not comply to the normality test at the imposed significance level",
    ".    why are these apparently small details important ? .",
    "one reason is that nuclear structure calculations are insensitive to long range potential , but quite dependent on the least known mid range part , so that errors are propagated to binding energies or matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the role played by @xmath150tpe and determination of chiral constants @xmath151 , @xmath152 @xmath153  @xcite ( where @xmath154 and @xmath155 ) and inclusion @xmath156-resonance  @xcite have been analyzed with the granada-2013 database . .    in all , the present situation regarding both the selection of data and the normality of residuals is highly satisfactory . in our view",
    ", this combined consistency of the statistical assumptions and the model analyzing them provides a good starting point to proceed further to determine the pion - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "the charge symmetry breaking is restricted to mass differences by setting @xmath158 and the value @xmath159 recommended by the nijmegen group  @xcite has been used in most of the potentials since the seminal 1993 partial wave analysis  @xcite . in their 1997 status",
    "report@xcite the nijmegen group wrote : _",
    "`` the present accuracies in the determination of the various coupling constants are such , that with a little improvement in the data and in the analyses these charge - independence breaking effects could be checked.''_. the granada-2013 database has 6713 data compared to the 4313 of nijmegen-1993",
    ". can this be the invoked little improvement ? .",
    "we try to answer this by recalling that electroweak corrections scale with the fine structure constant @xmath160 and the light quark mass differences .",
    "thus @xmath161 for the relative change around a mean value",
    ". these are naturally at the @xmath162 level , a small effect .",
    "the question is on how many independent measurements are needed to achieve this desired accuracy . according to the central limit theorem , for @xmath163 direct independent measurements the relative standard deviation scales as @xmath164 and @xmath165 for @xmath166 .",
    "we can not carry out these direct measurements of @xmath167 but we can proceed indirectly by considering a set of mutually consistent nn scattering measurements @xmath168 with @xmath125 and use a model with @xmath167 and @xmath169 parameters , which produces @xmath170 .",
    "we can then eliminate the parameters @xmath171 , in favor of @xmath114 experiments and we are left with @xmath172 independent observables which depend just on @xmath167 providing @xmath163 independent determinations .",
    "of course , these measurements will have some statistical error , so that @xmath173 , which means that @xmath174 is a random variable , and a @xmath131-fit is nothing but a democratic way of eliminating the parameters . since @xmath175 , we need about @xmath176 to witness isospin breaking with the coarse grained interaction , and in our recent work we do  @xcite . from our full covariance matrix analysis",
    "we get for the @xmath177 @xmath178 we thus confirm the premonition of the nijmegen group , although further `` little improvements '' are still needed to confirm an ordering pattern , such as e.g. eq .  ( [ eq : qm - order ] ) .    in fig .",

    "we also plot several nijmegen determinations including @xmath181  @xcite . assuming a unique pion - nucleon coupling constant we obtain @xmath182 which is @xmath183 compatible but almost three times more accurate .",

    "( [ eq : g s ] ) is compatible with this last determination , but twice more accurate .",
    "according to our analysis neutrons interact more strongly than protons above @xmath189 , but we can not check what is the influence on neutron - neutron scattering as we have not determined the nn - interaction _ below _ @xmath190 .",
    "the traditional and compelling explanation that the nn scatering length is _ larger _ than the strong contribution to the pp - scattering length ( a model dependent quantity ) would rest on the assumption that there is no relevant isospin breaking below 3 fm , a fact that is not supported by our analysis and requires further understanding .",
    "isospin breaking at short distances has always been a difficult subject .",
    "we suggest to cut the gordian knot by separating the nn interaction in two distinct regions marked by a short distance radius @xmath190 and assuming a charge dependent one pion exchange above @xmath190 , as the unique strong contribution . below this radius",

    "<S> there exist four pion nucleon coupling constants , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 which coincide when up and down quark masses are identical and the electron charge is zero . </S>",
    "<S> while there is no reason why the pion - nucleon - nucleon coupling constants should be identical in the real world , one expects that the small differences might be pinned down from a sufficiently large number of independent and mutually consistent data . </S>",
    "<S> our discussion provides a rationale for our recent determination @xmath4 based on a partial wave analysis of the @xmath5 self - consistent nucleon - nucleon granada-2013 database comprising 6713 published data in the period 1950 - 2013 . </S>"
