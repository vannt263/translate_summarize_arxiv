    "super - kamiokande ( sk ) @xcite is a cylindrical water cherenkov detector with 50-kton of purified water and about 11000 of 20-inch pmt s .",
    "it is located 1000 m underground ( 2700 m water equivalence ) in kamioka observatory , icrr , university of tokyo in mozumi mine in gifu prefecture in japan .",
    "figure [ sk - photo ] shows the inside of the sk detector .",
    "the fiducial volume of the sk detector is 22.5 kton .",
    "the main observation targets of sk detector are solar neutrinos , atmospheric neutrinos , supernova neutrinos , and nucleon decays . sk is the largest detector in the world for these physics targets .    sk has started its observation in 1996 .",
    "table [ run - hist ] shows a summary of the sk experiments .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,^ \" , ]     the systematic uncertainty on the total flux is estimated to be 2.1 @xmath0 .",
    "this is about two thirds of the corresponding sk - i value .",
    "the main contributions to the improvement are the vertex shift , angular resolution , and event selection uncertainties .",
    "the total live time for solar neutrino analysis in sk - iii is 548 days for @xmath1 mev , and 289 days for @xmath2 mev .",
    "the recoil electron s total energy range used for this analysis is from 5.0 to 20 mev . the observed @xmath3b solar neutrino flux via the es reaction is @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , which is consistent with the previous sk - i and ii results .",
    "the obtained day - night asymmetry is @xmath6 .",
    "the total @xmath3b and hep flux values are referred from the bp2004 standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite .",
    "we used the expected spectrum of @xmath3b and hep neutrinos calculated by winter  @xcite and bahcall  @xcite , respectively .",

    "in addition , combining the above and kamland data  @xcite , the best - fit parameter set becomes @xmath17 and @xmath18  ev@xmath16 .",
    "we also performed a preliminary 3-flavor oscillation analysis . in the 3-flavor analysis ,",
    "the calculation of oscillation probability is based on reference  @xcite .",
    "the probability can be calculated with three parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , assuming @xmath21 .",
    "we fixed @xmath22  ev@xmath16 and the normal hierarchy is assumed .",
    "for the solar neutrino oscillation , the other mixing parameters are irrelevant , but we set @xmath23 and @xmath24 in our calculation .    as done for the two - flavor analysis , the oscillation probabilities depending on different zenith angles are calculated .",
    "other experiment data are have been published by homestake , sage , gallex - gno , borexino , sno , and kamland .",
