    "every closed orientable @xmath0-manifold can be decomposed into two handlebodies of the same genus , which is called a heegaard splitting of the manifold .",
    "the genus of the handlebodies is called the genus of the splitting .",
    "the @xmath0-sphere admits a heegaard splitting of each genus @xmath1 , and a lens space a heegaard splitting of each genus @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , they are known to have a unique heegaard splitting up to isotopy for each genus .",
    "there is a well known simplicial complex , called the disk complex , for a handlebody , in general for an arbitrary irreducible @xmath0-manifold with compressible boundary .",
    "the disk complex is not only a powerful tool when we study the mapping class group of a manifold , but already an interesting topological object by itself . for a heegaard splitting of a manifold",
    ", one can define a special subcomplex of the disk complex for one of the handlebodies in the splitting , which is invariant under any automorphism of the manifold preserving the given splitting .",
    "in particular , when a given splitting is stabilized , we define a natural subcomplex of the disk complex for one of the handlebodies , which is called the primitive disk complex .",
    "the primitive disk complex is the full subcomplex spanned by special kind of vertices , the vertices of primitive disks in the handlebody .",
    "the group of automorphisms preserving a given splitting of genus @xmath3 is called the genus @xmath3 goeritz group of the splitting .",
    "investigating the action of the goeritz group on an appropriate subcomplex , one might have a useful information on this group .",
    "for example , in @xcite and @xcite , the primitive disk complex for the genus two heegaard splitting for each of the @xmath0-sphere and the lens spaces @xmath4 is studied to obtain a finite presentation of the genus two goeritz group of the splitting .",
    "the study of the primitive disk complexes was motivated by scharlemann s work @xcite on the complex of reducing spheres for the genus two splitting of the @xmath0-sphere , which was analyzed further by akbas @xcite . a generalized version of a primitive disk complex is also studied in @xcite for the group of automorphisms of the @xmath0-sphere preserving a genus two handlebody knot embedded in the @xmath0-sphere .",
    "in this work , we are interested in the primitive disk complex for the genus two heegaard splitting of each lens space @xmath5 .",
    "the main results are theorems [ thm : contractible ] and [ thm : structure ] . in theorem",
    "[ thm : contractible ] , we find all lens spaces whose primitive disk complexes for their genus two splittings are contractible .",
    "it states that , for a lens space @xmath5 with @xmath6 , the primitive disk complex for the genus two splitting of @xmath5 is contractible if and only if @xmath7 .",
    "in theorem [ thm : structure ] , we give a complete combinatorial structure of the primitive disk complex for each lens space , and describe how each of the complexes sits in the ambient disk complex for the genus two handlebody .",
    "in particular , a contractible primitive disk complex is two dimensional if and only if @xmath8 or @xmath9 , and otherwise it is a tree .",
    "any non - contractible primitive disk complex turns out to be not connected and consists of infinitely but countably many tree components .    in the follow - up work @xcite",
    ", the results on the primitive disk complexes we obtained here will be fully used to find a presentation of the genus two goeritz group of each lens space @xmath5 , including the special case of @xmath4 done in @xcite .",

    "that is , there is a genus one heegaard splitting of @xmath11 such that an oriented meridian circle of a solid torus of the splitting is identified with a @xmath12-curve on the boundary torus of the other solid torus ( fixing oriented longitude and meridian circles of the torus ) , where @xmath13 is isomorphic to the cyclic group of order @xmath14 .",
    "the integer @xmath15 can be assumed to be positive , and it is well known that two lens spaces @xmath5 and @xmath16 are homeomorphic if and only if @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",

    "further , there is a unique integer @xmath20 satisfying @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and so , for any other genus one heegaard splitting of @xmath5 , we may assume that an oriented meridian circle of a solid torus of the splitting is identified with a @xmath23-curve on the boundary torus of the other solid torus for some @xmath24 .    throughout the paper , @xmath25 will denote a genus two heegaard splitting of a lens space @xmath10 .",

    "any disks in a handlebody are always assumed to be properly embedded , and their intersection is transverse and minimal up to isotopy . in particular , if a disk @xmath30 intersects a disk @xmath31 , then @xmath32 is a collection of pairwise disjoint arcs that are properly embedded in both @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "finally , @xmath33 will denote a regular neighborhood of @xmath34 and @xmath35 the closure of @xmath34 for a subspace @xmath34 of a polyhedral space , where the ambient space will always be clear from the context .",
