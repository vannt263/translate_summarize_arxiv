    "<S> recently the experimental discoveries of three - dimensional ( 3d ) topological dirac semimetals and weyl semimetals @xcite have stimulated enormous research interest in topological semimetals . </S>",
    "<S> topological semimetallic ( ts ) materials are characterized by robust bulk band crossing points and the associated topological boundary states . in the 3d ts materials , </S>",
    "<S> the band crossing points can be either zero dimensional ( 0d ) discrete nodal points or one dimensional ( 1d ) continuous nodal lines . </S>",
    "<S> materials that host these exotic band structures </S>",
    "<S> exhibit unique properties and hold promise for applications such as topological qubits , low - power electronics and spintronics . one prominent example of ts materials with 0d band crossing points is the weyl semimetals . </S>",
    "<S> the nodal points of weyl semimetals carry non - zero chiral charges and are connected by the fermi arc surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the weyl semimetals have been experimentally realized in transition metal monopnictides such as taas @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the other class of topological semimetals is the nodal - line semimetal whose conduction and valence bands cross each other at closed lines instead of discrete points . </S>",
    "<S> the topological nodal - line semimetal is distinct in three aspects compared to the weyl semimatal : ( 1 ) the bulk fermi surface is 1d and 0d in nodal - line semimetals and weyl semimetals , respectively ; ( 2 ) the density of states of low - energy bulk excitations is proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 in nodal - line and weyl semimetals , respectively ; ( 3 ) the nodal lines are accompanied by  drumhead \"- like surface states while weyl nodal points are connected by 1d fermi arc surface states @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> for example , interaction - induced instabilities that have been broadly discussed for weyl semimetals should be more likely occurring in nodal - line states due to the higher density of states at the fermi energy .    up to date , there have been several theoretical proposals for a material realization of topological nodal - line semimetals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these works predict nodal - line bulk states and  drumhead \" surface states . </S>",

    "<S> , each nodal line is gapped due to the interaction between spin components . in real materials </S>",
    "<S> soc , on the other hand , is ubiquitous , therefore it is important to study nodal - line semimetals under the condition of nonvanishing soc . </S>",
    "<S> generally , spinful nodal lines are unstable , which can be seen from a simple codimension analysis @xcite . in order to have robust nodal lines in the presence of soc </S>",
    "<S> , an extra crystalline symmetry is needed to protect them . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we report , based on first - principles calculations , the existence of spinful topological nodal lines in the ternary transition - metal chalcogenide tltase@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the nodal lines are 0.22 ev below the fermi level and protected by a mirror reflection symmetry of the space group . </S>",
    "<S> the topological nodal - line state in tltase@xmath1 is in the class a+@xmath5 ( p = 2 ) of symmetry - protected semimetals @xcite and is conneted with spin - polarized  drumhead \" surface modes . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate an exotic lifshitz transition as a consequence of the linkage among multiple  drumhead \" surface - state pockets . </S>",
    "<S> our results establish tltase@xmath1 a promising material for studying nodal - line physics .    </S>",

    "<S> 1a , crystalizes in a hexagonal lattice in which the unit cell consists of one tl , one ta and two se atoms and each atom resides on a hexagonal layer . </S>",
    "<S> the stacking sequence of these atomic planes within the unit cell is tl - se - ta - se : b - a - b - a ( a , b and c , here , refer to the three high - symmetry spots on a hexagonal lattice ) . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the tl layer intercalates between adjacent tase@xmath1 layers with tl atoms aligned with ta atoms in the vertical direction . </S>",
    "<S> the structure is non - centrosymmetric and belongs to the space group @xmath6 ( 187 ) . </S>",

    "<S> this reflection symmetry plays a key role in protecting the topological nodal lines , as discussed later on . </S>",
    "<S> figure 1b shows the bulk and ( 001)-projected surface brillouin zones where the a , h and l points are high symmetry points on the @xmath7 = @xmath8 plane , a mirror plane of the bulk brillouin zone . </S>",

    "<S> , a hole pocket derived from ta-@xmath9 orbitals crosses an electron pocket from tl-@xmath10 orbitals , taking the plane parallel to the ta atomic plane as the @xmath11-@xmath12 plane . </S>",
    "<S> all these atomic orbitals are invariant under the mirror reflection @xmath13 with respect to the tl atomic plane . a zoom - in view of band structure around h </S>",

    "<S> 1d . in the case without soc , the conduction and valence bands belong to different representations of the space group , a@xmath14 and a@xmath15 for electron and hole bands , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the intersection of the two bands is , therefore , protected by the crystalline symmetry , forming a spinless nodal ring on the mirror plane @xmath7 = @xmath8 . upon turning on soc , </S>",
    "<S> each band splits into two spin - polarized branches since the system lacks space inversion symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the spin splitting results in an accidental band touching of ta and tl bands at h and three band crossings . </S>",
    "<S> only the band crossing 0.22 ev below the fermi level remains gapless while the other two are gapped . a detailed analysis on the symmetry , orbital composition and spin texture of the bands around h </S>",
    "<S> is presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . the bands are mainly comprised of ta-@xmath9 and tl-@xmath10 states which are mostly confined the ta and tl atomic planes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the spin of these states is primarily oriented along @xmath16 as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a . </S>",
    "<S> at the gapless crossing point , the two branches have opposite mirror parity eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , this band crossing is protected by the mirror symmetry , forming a pair of nodal rings on the mirror plane @xmath7 = @xmath8 , one around h and the other around h@xmath14 . to visualize the nodal rings , we plot the iso - energy contour at @xmath17 = @xmath180.18  ev , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b . </S>",
    "<S> the energy is slightly off the nodal - line energy ( @xmath180.22 ev ) , which creates a tubular fermi surface enclosing nodal lines . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we can find two rings surrounding h and h@xmath14 points on @xmath7 = @xmath8 plane . at the center of the bulk brillouin zone </S>",
    "<S> there is a spherical fermi surface which is the hole pocket around @xmath19 mainly derived from the ta-5@xmath20 orbitals .    to further illustrate the mechanism of mirror - symmetry protection on the nodal rings , we develop an effective @xmath21 description . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection symmetry @xmath13 that sends @xmath16 to @xmath22 in position space acts on the spin degree of freedom like the third pauli matrix @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure of tltase@xmath1 is layered in the @xmath16 direction , where tl and ta layers are alternating . </S>",
    "<S> a consistent choice of the action of @xmath13 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the single - particle wave functions of an electrons in the tl and ta orbitals in the unit cell indexed by the integers @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 . for bloch states in the @xmath30 plane , </S>",
    "<S> the action of @xmath13 is local in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath31 is a 4-spinor in the space of spin and tl / ta orbital degrees of freedom , then @xmath13 has the representation @xmath32 where the pauli matrices @xmath33 act on the spin space and the pauli matrices @xmath34 act on the tl / ta orbital space .    </S>",
    "<S> we now give an effective @xmath21 hamiltonian to explain how the line nodes centered around the h / h@xmath14 points arise . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus on h , implying that the hamiltonian around h@xmath14 follows as its time - reversal symmetric conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> we observe from the first principal calculations that the dispersions for the tl and ta orbitals are particle- and hole - like , respectively , around these high - symmetry points . in absence of spin - orbit coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian for small momenta away from h is given by @xmath35 which commutes with the representation @xmath36 of @xmath13 within the mirror plane .    </S>",
    "<S> we will include spin - orbit coupling terms that are constants to lowest order in @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> relevant mass terms are given by @xmath38 where the mass terms @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be any matrix that anticommutes with the kinetic term @xmath41 , but commutes with the mirror symmetry @xmath36 . this leaves four choices of mass terms , namely @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> . all of them will be in principle present . </S>",
    "<S> we have included two of them in the above hamiltonian to reproduce the qualitative feature observed in the dft calculations that the band gap above the nodal ring is much smaller than the band gap below the nodal ring . </S>",
    "<S> this means that two competing ( i.e. , commuting ) mass terms are almost of the same magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we can choose @xmath46 and @xmath47 as competing mass terms .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider @xmath48 for @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the bands are given by @xmath50 with uncorrelated signs . </S>",
    "<S> the middle two bands are degenerate along ( at most ) two lines with @xmath51 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> these two nodal lines are protected by the opposite mirror eigenvalues of the crossing bands . </S>",
    "<S> the actual band structure of tltase@xmath1 is close to the parameter regime where the line node with smaller radius shrinks to zero . </S>",
    "<S> it disappears at the parameter point @xmath52    the band structure from the effective hamiltonian is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c , which is in remarkable agreement with the first - principles result . considering the crystalline symmetry of tltase@xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the nodal line at h is classified as the time - reversal breaking class a+@xmath5 which admits an integer topological classification for fermi surfaces of codimension 2 , i.e. , lines ( p = 2 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that although the entire system preserves time - reversal symmetry , the effective hamiltonian at h lacks time - reversal symmetry , which makes the nodal lines of tltase@xmath1 in a different class from those reported in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nodal lines of tltase@xmath1 are characterized by a topological quantum number @xmath53 , which is given by the difference in the number of occupied bands with @xmath13 eigenvalue + 1 inside and outside the nodal line . in the case at hand , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath53 = + 1 for the nodal line at h in the @xmath7 = @xmath8 plane as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2c . </S>",
    "<S> we also perform a band structure calculation in which that the ta atom is slightly moved in the vertical direction and , thus , the mirror reflection symmetry is broken . in this case </S>",
    "<S> all of the four branches around h are found to belong to the same @xmath54 representation of the reduced space group and a gap opening is allowed at every crossing point of these branches , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2d . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the nodal line in this case is gapped by mirror - symmetry - breaking perturbations . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the nodal rings in tltase@xmath1 are indeed under the protection of the mirror reflection symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> next we study the evolution of the nodal lines as soc varies . </S>",
    "<S> the nodal - line band structure at various soc is plotted in fig . 3a . as shown in the above discussion , without soc </S>",
    "<S> there is a spinless nodal line around h. once turning on soc , each band becomes two spin branches with opposite mirror parity eigenvalues and the spinless crossing line is , consequently , split into four spinful crossing lines . </S>",
    "<S> however , among these four crossing lines only two are robust under the protection of mirror reflection symmetry . in this case </S>",
    "<S> they are the crossings between bands b1 and b4 and between b2 and b3 , because the mirror parity of b2 and b4 is @xmath55 and that of b1 and b3 is @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> so there are two nodal rings around h arising from the two symmetry - protected band crossings . </S>",
    "<S> the crossings between b1 and b3 and between b2 and b4 are gapped . </S>",
    "<S> the gap size at the topmost b1-b3 crossing is very small , but it can be evidently seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2a and explained by our effective hamiltonian as shown in fig .  2c . as soc increases , bands b2 and b3 </S>",
    "<S> are gradually pulled apart from each other and with soc = 1 in the scale relative to the real soc of the material the two bands barely touch . for even larger soc , e.g. soc = 1.2 , the two bands separate and , as a result , the nodal ring associated with these two bands disappears . </S>",
    "<S> therefore only one nodal ring is left when soc is beyond the critical value 1 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b , we plot the energy difference between the top of band b2 and the bottom of band b3 as a function of soc . varying soc , </S>",
    "<S> we have three different phases of nodal lines , namely , spinless nodal line , double nodal line , and single nodal line .    in order to illustrate connection of  drumhead \" surface states with the bulk nodal lines , the surface electronic structure is constructed using a first - principles - derived tight - binding model hamilton in a slab . </S>",
    "<S> the projected ( 001)-bulk band structure along @xmath57 direction is plotted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4a where the nodal line is clearly seen . </S>",
    "<S> the surface can be terminated with either a se layer or a tl layer , because the bonding between se and tl atoms is much weaker than that between se and ta atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the surface band structure corresponding to the two possible terminations is shown in figs . 4b and 4c . in the case of se termination , </S>",
    "<S> the surface band disperses outwards with respect to @xmath58 from the nodal line and grazes outwards at the edge of the bulk band below the nodal line and merges into the bulk band region , as marked by the arrows in fig . </S>",

    "<S> this can be also seen in the iso - energy band contour at e = @xmath59 ev ( slightly below the energy of the nodal line , -0.22 ev ) , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4d . </S>",
    "<S> the  drumhead \" surface states overlap with the bulk nodal rings and there is no other surface state at this energy . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the surface band structure on the tl - terminated surface is dramatically different . along @xmath60 direction , </S>",
    "<S> starting from the nodal point , the surface band grazes outwards at the edge of the upper bulk dirac cone and merges into the bulk band . </S>",
    "<S> along @xmath61 direction , the  drumhead \" surface band @xmath62 disperses into the bulk band gap . </S>",
    "<S> within the gap there exists a second surface band @xmath63 which joins the  drumhead \" band at @xmath64 forming a kramers pair . the spin polarization of the two surface bands is shown in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the spin texture is unique in the sense that as moving along either surface band clockwisely , the spin orientation rotate in counterclockwise direction . </S>",
    "<S> the spin orientation is not always in the tangential direction of the fermi surface contour , which is distinct from the spin - momentum - locked texture of dirac surface states in conventional topological insulators @xcite . at the energy of the nodal rings ( @xmath17 = @xmath180.22 ev ) , </S>",
    "<S> the eye - shaped contour connects to the nodal rings and , as energy moves further up , the corners of the eyes open and the  drumhead \" surface band @xmath62 transforms into a giant closed contour surrounding @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this topological change in the band contour is known as lifshitz transition in the electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> the lifshitz transition discussed here is special in two aspects : ( 1 ) the transition and the associate saddle - point singularity happen in spin - polarized 2d surface bands ; ( 2 ) the transition relies on a linkage of multiple small pockets around @xmath64 to form a giant pocket surrounding @xmath66 . </S>",
