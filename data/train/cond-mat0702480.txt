    "since the experimental observations of macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) in ybco ( ybacuo ) grain boundary  @xcite and bscco ( bisrcacuo ) intrinsic  @xcite josephson junctions , the macroscopic quantum dynamics of high-@xmath2 @xmath1-wave junctions has become a hot topic in the field of superconductor quantum electronics and quantum computation .",
    "recently , the effect of low - energy quasiparticles , e.g. , the nodal - quasiparticles and the zero energy bound states ( zess )  @xcite on mqt in @xmath1-wave junctions have been theoretically investigated .  @xcite it was found that , in @xmath3-axis type junctions ,  @xcite the suppression of mqt resulting from the nodal - quasiparticles is very weak .",
    "@xcite this result is consistent with recent experimental observations .",
    "@xcite in the case of in - plane type @xmath1-wave junctions ,  @xcite however , the zess give a strong dissipative effect .",
    "@xcite therefore , it is important to avoid the formation of zess in order to observe mqt with a high quantum - to - classical crossover temperature @xmath4 .    on the other hand , recently , quiet qubits consisting of a superconducting loop with an @xmath0-wave/@xmath1-wave ( @xmath5 ) hybrid junction have been proposed .",
    "@xcite in quiet qubits , a quantum two level system is spontaneously generated and therefore it is expected to be robust to decoherence from fluctuations of the external magnetic field .",
    "@xcite however , the influence of the low - energy quasiparticle dissipation due to nodal - quasiparticles and zess on @xmath5 quiet qubits is not yet understood .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate such intrinsic dissipation effects on the macroscopic quantum dynamics in order to realize quiet qubits .    in this paper , motivated by the above studies and the recent phase - sensitive spectroscopy experiments in @xmath5 junctions ,  @xcite we will discuss the application of a generic mqt theory  @xcite to @xmath5 hybrid josephson junctions [ see fig .",
    "in contrast with @xmath6 junctions ,  @xcite we will show that the influence of the low - energy quasiparticle dissipation is suppressed by virtue of the small but finite isotropic gap in the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "therefore , weak quasiparticle dissipation is anticipated in such junctions .",
    "we will also discuss an extrinsic ohmic dissipative effect in a real @xmath5 ( nb / au / ybco ) junction  @xcite and show that high @xmath4 , comparable to high - quality @xmath7 junctions , is expected .",
    "these results clearly indicate the advantage of @xmath5 junction for qubit applications with longer coherence time .",
    "in the following we will calculate the mqt rate in @xmath0/@xmath1 junctions with a clean insulating barrier and without extrinsic dissipation , e.g. , an ohmic dissipation in a shunt resistance .",
    "extrinsic dissipative effects in an actual junction will be discussed later .",

    "@xcite then , in the case of low temperatures ( @xmath40 ) and high barriers ( @xmath41 ) , we get the analytical expressions as @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind , @xmath46 is the josephson critical current for the @xmath0/@xmath0 junctions , @xmath47 is the normal state resistance of the junction , @xmath48 is the resistance quantum , and @xmath49 is the channel number at the fermi energy . in this calculation , we have assumed that the amplitude of the pair potential is given by @xmath50 for @xmath0 , @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath36 , where @xmath54 . by using the analytical expression of the josephson current ( 5 )",

    "@xmath39 can be expressed as a tilted washboard potential ( see fig .",

    "next we will calculate the dissipation kernel @xmath27 . in the high barrier limit , the quasiparticle current",
    "is given in terms of the convolution of the quasiparticle surface density of states ( dos ) ,  @xcite i.e. , @xmath57 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the transmission amplitude of the barrier i , @xmath59 is the quasiparticle surface dos ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 or @xmath36 ) , and @xmath62 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the surface dos for @xmath0-wave superconductors is @xmath63 in the case of @xmath52 , no zes are formed .",
    "therefore the angle @xmath64 dependence of the dos is the same as the bulk , i.e. , @xmath65 on the other hand , the dos for @xmath36 is given by  @xcite @xmath66 the delta function peak at @xmath67 corresponds to the zes . because of the quasiparticle bound state at @xmath67 , the quasiparticle current for the @xmath35 junctions is drastically different from that for the @xmath34 junctions in which no zes are formed .",
    "@xcite in the limit of low temperatures ( @xmath68 ) , we can obtain the analytical expression of the dissipation kernel @xmath27 as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the modified bessel function .",
    "for @xmath71 the dissipation kernel decays exponentially as a function of the imaginary time @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73 the typical dynamical time scale of the macroscopic variable @xmath8 is of the order of the inverse josephson plasma frequency @xmath14 which is much smaller than @xmath50 .",

    "this indicates that the quasiparticle dissipation in @xmath0/@xmath1 junctions is qualitatively weaker than that in in - plane @xmath6 junctions in which the super - ohmic ( @xmath80)@xcite or ohmic dissipation ( @xmath81 )  @xcite appears . at zero temperature",

    "thus , in the case of large @xmath50 , the influence of the low - energy quasiparticle dissipation on the macroscopic quantum dynamics becomes very weak .",

    "activated ( ta ) decay dominates the escape process .",
    "then the escape rate is given by the kramers formula  @xcite @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the barrier height .",
    "below the crossover temperature @xmath4 , the escape process is dominated by mqt . in the absence of dissipative effects ,",
    "@xmath113 ,  @xcite where @xmath114 is the josephson critical current density ( @xmath115 is the junction area ) and @xmath116 ( @xmath117 is the permittivity of i and @xmath118 is the barrier thickness ) .",
    "importantly , @xmath4 is reduced in the presence of dissipation .",
    "@xcite    in order to see explicitly the effect of the quasiparticle dissipation on mqt , we numerically estimate @xmath4 .",
    "we determine @xmath4 from the relation @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the standard deviation of @xmath107 for the temperature - dependent ta process and the temperature - independent mqt process , respectively .",
    "presently , no experimental data are available for ideal highly under - damped @xmath5 junctions with large mccumber parameters @xmath122 ( @xmath123 is the subgap resistance ) .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath4 by using the parameters for an actual nb / au / ybco junction  @xcite ( @xmath124pf , @xmath125a at @xmath32 , and @xmath126 ) in which @xmath127 .",
    "we also assume @xmath128a for simplicity , @xmath129mev , @xmath130mev ,  @xcite and @xmath131a / s . in the case of @xmath34 junctions , we obtain @xmath132mk for the dissipationless case ( @xmath133 ) and @xmath134mk for the dissipative case ( @xmath135 ) . thus , the influence of the nodal - quasiparticle is negligibly small . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath35 junctions , we get @xmath136mk for the dissipationless case and @xmath137mk for the dissipative case . therefore ,",
    "as expected , the zes have a larger influence on mqt than the nodal - quasiparticles .",
    "however , the @xmath4 suppression is small enough to allow experimental observations of mqt .      in the above calculation",
    ", we have assumed that the junction is ideal , i.e. , the insulating barrier ( i ) is perfect so that we have ignored dissipation by a shunt resistance which is caused by imperfections of i. however , in practice , it is currently very difficult to fabricate such a perfect junction .",
    "here we will investigate mqt in realistic junctions to check the feasibility of the mqt observation .",
    "recently , nb / au / ybco ramp - edge junctions have been fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition technique .",
    "@xcite these junctions can be regarded as hybrid @xmath5 junctions between the proximity - effect induced @xmath0-wave superconductor in au and the @xmath1-wave superconductor in ybco .",
    "@xcite importantly , the mismatch angle @xmath12 of the ybco crystal can be artificially varied as a single parameter . by use of these junctions , angle - resolved electron tunneling experiments  @xcite and scanning - squid microscopy measurements",
    "@xcite have been performed in order to test the momentum dependence of the cooper pairing amplitude and phases in ybco .",
    "the main differences between these junctions and the junctions with the clean interface discussed in sec .",
    "ii a are as follows .",
    "firstly , in actual nb / au / ybco junctions , ( i ) the ohmic dissipation in the shunt resistance will dominate over the intrinsic quasiparticle dissipation resulting from the nodal - quasiparticles and the zess , because the observed mccumber parameter @xmath138 is the order of unity .",
    "this observation can not be explained only by taking into account an intrinsic quasiparticle dissipation .",
    "thus we have to consider an extrinsic ohmic dissipation source .",
    "moreover , due to the surface roughness  @xcite and the very low transparency  @xcite of the actual insulating barrier i , ( ii ) the contribution of the zess to the josephson current is expected to be small , so the @xmath139 component of the josephson current can be neglected . from ( ii ) , the actual @xmath12 dependence of the josephson current is given by @xmath140 with @xmath141 .",
    "@xcite this can be nicely fitted by a theoretical model ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) in ref .",
    "[ ] ) in which the effect of the zess is neglected .",
    "then the effective action which describes the nb / au / ybco junction can be expressed as @xmath142 = \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau   \\left [     \\frac{m}{2 }      \\left (    \\frac{\\partial \\phi ( \\tau ) } { \\partial \\tau }    \\right)^2     +     u(\\phi )   \\right ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & - & \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau    \\int_{0}^{\\hbar \\beta } d \\tau '    \\alpha_{\\mathrm{s } } ( \\tau - \\tau ' ) \\frac { \\left [ \\phi(\\tau ) - \\phi ( \\tau ' ) \\right]^2}{8 }    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath143 where @xmath144 @xmath145 .",

    "3 shows the dependence of @xmath4 on the mismatch angle @xmath12 . by changing @xmath12",
    ", we can control the macroscopic quantum dynamics , i.e. , the mqt rate of the junction artificially .",
    "note that the maximum @xmath4 is attained when @xmath32 .",
    "although @xmath4 is reduced by the dissipative effects , its magnitude ( @xmath156k at @xmath32 ) is comparable to high quality @xmath0/@xmath0 junctions ( @xmath157k )  @xcite and much larger than ybco junctions ( @xmath158k ) .",
    "@xcite this can be attributed to the high josephson critical current density @xmath159ka/@xmath160 and the weak ohmic dissipative effect despite the small @xmath138 .",
    "therefore , mqt should still be experimentally observable using the current junction fabrication and measurement technology .",
    "moreover , if we increase @xmath161 or decrease the capacitance per area @xmath162 of the junction , we can get still larger @xmath4 .",
    "in conclusion , mqt in the @xmath0/@xmath1 hybrid josephson junctions with the perfect insulating barrier has been theoretically investigated using the path integral method .",
    "the effect of the low energy quasiparticles on mqt is found to be weak .",
    "this can be attributed to the quasiparticle - tunneling blockade effect in the @xmath0-wave superconductor .",
    "we also investigated mqt in a realistic @xmath0/@xmath1 junction and showed that the expected @xmath4 is relatively high in spite of the small @xmath138 .",
    "these results strongly indicate the high promise of @xmath0/@xmath1 hybrid junctions for quantum computer applications .",
    "finally we would like to comment the advantage of the @xmath5 junctions over the @xmath7 and @xmath6 junctions . as compared to @xmath7 junction",
    ", @xmath5 junctions with the clean interface will have much larger @xmath163 .",
    "so we can expect that such @xmath5 junctions show higher @xmath4 than the @xmath7 junctions . in @xmath164 junctions ,",
    "the nodal - quasiparticles give negligibly small effect on mqt .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , as was shown by fominov @xmath165 @xmath166 ,  @xcite the decoherence time of the @xmath164 qubit is not enough for practical quantum computation .",
    "this indicates that the nodal quasiparticles still have large influence on the qubit operation .",
    "however , due to the quasiparticle tunneling blockade effect in the @xmath5 junctions , the decoherence time of the @xmath5 qubit is expected to be much longer than that of the @xmath164 qubits .",

    "<S> we have theoretically investigated macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) and the influence of nodal quasiparticles and zero energy bound states ( zes ) on mqt in @xmath0-wave/ @xmath1-wave hybrid josephson junctions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to @xmath1-wave/@xmath1-wave junctions , the low - energy quasiparticle dissipation resulting from nodal quasiparticles and zess is suppressed due to a quasiparticle - tunneling blockade effect in an isotropic @xmath0-wave superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the inherent dissipation in these junctions is found to be weak . </S>",
    "<S> we have also investigated mqt in a realistic @xmath0-wave/@xmath1-wave ( nb / au / ybco ) junction in which ohmic dissipation in a shunt resistance is stronger than the inherent dissipation and find that mqt is observable within the current experimental technology . </S>",
    "<S> this result suggests high potential of @xmath0-wave/@xmath1-wave hybrid junctions for applications in quantum information devices . </S>"
