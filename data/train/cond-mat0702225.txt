    "in this paper and its companion  @xcite , hereafter referred to as ii , we present a general theoretical approach for investigation of thermal and transport properties of superconductors in magnetic field , and use it to determine the behavior of the density of states , specific heat , and thermal conductivity in the vortex state of unconventional superconductors . our more specific goal here is to provide connection between theory and recent experiments measuring the properties of such superconductors under a rotating magnetic field , to explain the existing data , and to guide future experimental studies .",
    "we focus on these experiments as they hold exceptional promise for helping determine the structure of the superconducting energy gap .",
    "we consider unconventional superconductors , for which in the ordered state both the gauge symmetry and the spatial point group symmetry are broken  @xcite .",
    "then the gap in the single particle spectrum , @xmath5 , is momentum dependent .",
    "we focus on anisotropic pairing states with zeroes , or nodes , of the superconducting gap for some directions on the fermi surface ( fs ) .",
    "the single particle energy spectrum of a superconductor is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the band energy in the normal state with respect to the fermi level .",
    "consequently , the gap nodes , @xmath8 , are the loci of the low energy quasiparticles , and the number of quasiparticles excited by temperature or other perturbations depends on the topology of the nodal regions .",
    "experimental probes that predominantly couple to unpaired electrons , for example the heat capacity or ( for pairing in the singlet channel ) magnetization , are commonly used to show the existence of the gap nodes .",
    "the nodal behavior is manifested by @xmath9 power laws , with the exponent @xmath10 that depends on the structure of the gap @xcite .",
    "locating the nodes on the fermi surface is a harder task .",
    "since usually only the phase of the gap , but not the gap amplitude , @xmath5 , breaks the point group symmetry , transport coefficients in the superconducting state retain the symmetry of the normal metal above @xmath11 .",
    "the phase of the order parameter can be tested by surface measurements , but experimental determination of the nodal directions in the bulk requires breaking of an additional symmetry .",
    "one possible approach is to apply a magnetic field , @xmath12 , and rotate it with respect to the crystal lattice .",
    "the effect of @xmath12 on the nodal quasiparticles depends on the angle between the fermi velocity at the nodes and the field , and hence provides a directional probe of the nodal properties  @xcite .    at the simplest level , screening of the field and the resulting flow of the cooper pairs , either in the meissner or in the vortex state ,",
    "locally shifts the energy required to create an unpaired quasiparticle relative to the condensate ( doppler shift ) @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on the vortex state , where the supercurrents are in the plane normal to the applied field , and hence only the quasiparticles moving in the same plane are significantly affected .",
    "applying the field at different angles with respect to the nodes preferentially excites quasiparticles at different locations at the fermi surface , and leads to features in the density of states ( as a function of the field direction ) @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , produces oscillations in the measurable thermodynamic and transport quantities , which can be used to investigate the nodal structure of unconventional superconductors .",
    "such investigations have been carried out experimentally in a wide variety of systems . due to higher precision of transport measurements ,",
    "more data exist on the thermal conductivity anisotropy under rotated field .",
    "the anisotropy was reported in high - temperature superconductors @xcite , heavy fermion upd@xmath13al@xmath14 @xcite , cecoin@xmath4 @xcite , pros@xmath15sb@xmath16 @xcite , organic @xmath17-(bedt - ttf)@xmath13cu(ncs)@xmath13 @xcite , and borocarbide ( y , lu)ni@xmath13b@xmath13c @xcite , see ref .   for review .",
    "the heat capacity measurements are more challenging , and were carried out in the borocarbides@xcite , and cecoin@xmath4 @xcite . while the experiments provided strong indications for particular symmetries of the superconducting gap in these materials , they did not lead to a general consensus . the main reason for that",
    "has been lack of reliable theoretical analysis of thermal and transport properties in the vortex state .",
    "historically , there was a schism between theoretical studies of the properties of @xmath18-wave type - ii superconductors at low fields , where the single particle states are localized in the vortex cores , and the investigations near the upper critical field , @xmath19 , where vortices nearly overlap and the quasiparticles exist everywhere in space .",
    "the distinction between the two regimes is not so clear cut in unconventional superconductors , since it is the extended near - nodal states that control the electronic properties both at high and at low fields @xcite .",
    "often it is hoped that a single theoretical approach may provide results valid over a wide temperature and field range in nodal superconductors .    in part because early experiments on the vortex state of unconventional superconductors focused on the high - t@xmath20 cuprates @xcite , theoretical work has long been rooted in the low field analysis .",
    "the doppler shift approximation was used to predict and analyze the behavior of the specific heat @xcite and the thermal conductivity @xcite under an applied magnetic field .",
    "the method is semiclassical in that it considers the energy shift of the nodal quasiparticles with momentum @xmath21 at a point @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , it is only valid at low fields , @xmath23 , when the vortices are far apart , and the supervelocity varies slowly on the scale of the coherence length . moreover , most such calculations account only for quasiparticles near the nodes , and therefore are restricted to energies small compared to the maximal superconducting gap , and hence to temperatures @xmath24 . in addition , the energy shift leaves the quasiparticle lifetime infinite in the absence of impurities , and therefore the method does not account for the scattering of the electrons on vortices . while some attempts to remedy the situation exist @xcite , no consistent description emerged .",
    "recent experiments cover heavy fermion and other low temperature superconductors , and generally include the regime @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , there has been significant interest in developing alternatives to the low field doppler shift approach .",
    "the goal is to treat transport and thermodynamics on equal footing , to be able to describe the electronic properties over a wide range of fields and temperatures , and to include the effects of scattering on vortices",
    ". fully numerical solution of the microscopic bogoliubov - de gennes equations have been employed for computing the density of states ( see , for example , ref .  ) , but are not naturally suited for computing correlation functions and transport properties .",
    "calculation of the green s function in the superconducting vortex state is difficult due to appearance of additional phase factors from the applied field .",
    "moreover , transport calculations need to include the vertex corrections , since the characteristic intervortex distance is large compared to lattice spacing , hence the scattering on the vortices corresponds to small momentum transfer , and the forward scattering is important .    here",
    "we use the microscopic approach in conjunction with a variant of the approximation originally due to brandt , pesch and tewordt ( bpt ) @xcite that replaces the normal electron part of the matrix green s function by its spatial average over a unit cell of the vortex lattice .",
    "while originally developed for @xmath18-wave superconductors , this approach has recently been successfully and widely applied to unconventional systems ( see sections [ sec : qcvort ] and [ sec : greensol ] for full discussion and references ) , where it gave results that are believed to be valid over a wide range of temperatures and fields @xcite .",
    "we employ the approximation in the framework of the quasiclassical method @xcite .",
    "two main advantages of this approach are : a ) bpt approximation results in a closed - form solution for the green s function @xcite enabling us to enforce self - consistency for any field , temperature , and impurity scattering , and facilitating the subsequent calculations of physical properties ; b ) quasiclassical equations are transport - like , so that the difference between single particle and transport lifetimes appears naturally , without the need to evaluate vertex corrections .",
    "consequently , we are able to compute the density of states , specific heat , and the thermal conductivity on equal footing , and provide a detailed comparison with experiment .    in this",
    "we pay particular attention to the data on heavy fermion cecoin@xmath4 , where the specific heat and the thermal conductivity data were interpreted as giving contradictory results for the shape of the superconducting gap .",
    "the anisotropic contribution to the specific heat exhibited minima for the field along the [ 100 ] directions , which led the authors to infer @xmath1 gap symmetry  @xcite , while the ( more complicated ) pattern in the thermal conductivity for the heat current along the [ 100 ] direction under rotated field was interpreted as consistent with the @xmath0 gap @xcite . in a recent letter",
    "@xcite we suggested a resolution for the discrepancy , and provide the detailed analysis here .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the companion paper ii uses these results to derive and discuss the behavior of the thermal conductivity .",
    "we aimed to make the article useful to both theorists and experimentalists .",

    "[ sec : qcyl ] show the main differences between the self - consistent and non - self - consistent calculations .",
    "we begin by writing down the quasiclassical equations for a singlet superconductor in magnetic field @xcite and summarizing the details relevant for our discussion .",
    "the equations are for the quasiclassical ( low - energy @xmath30 ) green s function , which is a matrix in the nambu ( spin and particle - hole ) space , ( , ; ) = (    cc g & i_2 f + i_2 & -g    ) .",
    "[ eq : dg ] this matrix propagator has been integrated over the quasiparticle band energy , and therefore depends only on the direction at the fermi surface , @xmath21 , and the center of mass coordinate , @xmath22 .",
    "we formulate our approach in terms of the real - energy retarded , advanced , and keldysh propagators .",
    "this is a natural path for the self - consistent calculation of the quasiparticle spectrum , needed for determination of thermodynamic properties such as entropy and heat capacity .",
    "moreover , the keldysh technique is the most direct route towards non - equilibrium calculations , required for the transport properties such as thermal conductivity , which is covered in the companion paper ii .",
    "consequently we establish a unified approach to describe both the thermodynamics and transport in the vortex state .",
    "retarded ( r ) and advanced ( a ) functions @xmath31 satisfy ( we take the electron charge @xmath32 ) [ ( + ec _ f ( ) ( ) ) _ 3 - ( , ) - _ imp ( ; ) , + ( , ; ) ] + i_f ( ) ( , ; ) = 0 , [ eq : eil ] together with the normalization condition ^r , a ( , ;",

    "[ eq : gnorm ] here @xmath30 is the real frequency , @xmath33 is the fermi velocity at a point @xmath34 on the fs .",
    "the magnetic field is described by the vector potential @xmath35 , and the self - energy @xmath36 is due to impurity scattering .",
    "the equations for the retarded and the advanced functions differ in the definition of the corresponding self - energies .    the mean field order parameter , = (    cc 0 & i_2 + i_2 ^ * & 0    ) , is defined via the self - consistency equation involving the keldysh function @xmath37 , ( , ) = d _ n_f( ) v ( ,  ) f^k ( ,  ; ) [ eq : deltasc ] , in equilibrium @xmath38 , and we obtain the usual self - consistency equation computing the @xmath30-integral in the upper ( lower ) half - plane for @xmath39 .",
    "we wrote eq.([eq : deltasc ] ) for a general fermi surface , and therefore introduced the density of states ( dos ) at a point @xmath21 on the fermi surface in the normal state , @xmath40 .",
    "the net density of states , @xmath41 , and we define @xmath42 .",
    "we absorbed the net dos , @xmath43 , into the definition of the pairing potential , @xmath44 .    since below we frequently perform the integrals over the fermi surface , we introduce a shorthand notation _",
    "= d _ n_f ( ) , so that the the gap equation above can be rewritten as ( , ) = v ( ,  ) f^k ( ,  ; ) _ [ eq : deltasc1 ] .",
    "all calculations below are for separable pairing , v(, ) = v_s ( ) (  ) , where @xmath45 is the normalized basis function for the particular angular momentum , @xmath46 .",
    "for example , for @xmath0 gap over a fermi surface parameterized by angle @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 .",
    "hence the order parameter is @xmath49 .",
    "finally , we include the isotropic impurity scattering via the self - energy , _ imp ( ; ) = (    cc d+ & i_2 _ imp + i_2 _ imp & d-    ) = n_imp ( ;) .",

    "( [ eq : eil ] ) .",
    "this term , however , generally appears in the keldysh part , and has a substantial effect on transport properties .",

    "so far our discussion remained completely general . in the vortex state of a superconductor , the order parameter and",
    "the field vary in space , and the quasiclassical equations have to be solved together with the self - consistency equations for the gap function , and maxwell s equation for the self - consistently determined magnetic field and the vector potential . finding a general _ non - uniform _ solution of such a system is a daunting , or even altogether impossible , task . therefore we make several simplifying assumptions and approximations that allow us to obtain a closed form solution for the green s function .",
    "first , we assume the magnetic field to be uniform .",
    "this assumption is valid for fields @xmath63 , where the typical intervortex spacing ( of the order of the magnetic length , @xmath64 ) is much smaller than the penetration depth , the diamagnetic magnetization due to the vortices is negligible compared to the applied field , and the local field is close to the applied external field , @xmath65 .",
    "all the materials for which the anisotropy measurements have been performed are extreme type - ii superconductors , where this assumption is valid over essentially the entire field range below @xmath19 .    in writing the quasiclassical equations we only included the orbital coupling to the magnetic field , assuming that it dominates over the the paramagnetic ( zeeman ) contribution .",
    "this is valid for most superconductors of interest , and the detailed analysis of the zeeman splitting will be presented separately  @xcite;the main conclusions of this paper remain unaffected .",
    "second , we take an abrikosov - like vortex lattice ansatz for the spatial variation of the order parameter , which is a linear superposition of the single - vortex solutions in the plane normal to the field .",
    "we enforce the self - consistency condition , which requires going beyond the simple form suggested by the linearized ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "the details of this choice are given in sec.[sec : green ] below .",
    "in the vortex lattice state the quasiclassical equations generally do not allow solution in a closed form .",
    "we therefore employ a variant of the approximation originally due to brandt , pesch and tewordt ( bpt ) @xcite .",
    "the method consists of replacing the diagonal part of the green s function by its spatial average , while keeping the full spatial structure of the off - diagonal terms .",
    "it was initially developed to describe superconductors near the upper critical field , where the amplitude of the order parameter is suppressed throughout the bulk , and the approximation is nearly exact .",
    "this is confirmed by expanding the green s function in the the fourier components of the reciprocal vortex lattice , @xmath66 . and noticing that @xmath67 so that the @xmath68 component is exponentially dominant.@xcite in situations where the states inside vortex cores are not crucial for the analysis , such as in extreme type - ii , @xcite or nodal superconductors @xcite the method remains valid essentially over the entire field range .",
    "consequently the bpt approach and its variations was extensively used to study unconventional superconductors in the vortex state.@xcite one of the advantages of the method that it reproduces correctly the @xmath69 bcs limit,@xcite and therefore may be used to interpolate over all fields .",
    "one , however , needs to be cautious in computing the properties of impure systems : averaging over the intervortex distance ( @xmath70 ) prior to averaging over impurities is allowed only when @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the mean free path , and hence the approach does break down at very low fields , and only asymptotically approaches the zero field result .",
    "we show the signatures of this breakdown in sec .",
    "[ sec : qcyl ] .",
    "the use of the bpt approximation relaxes the constraints imposed by the assumption of a perfectly periodic vortex arrangement . indeed , averaging over the unit cell of the vortex lattice is somewhat akin to the coherent potential approximation in many body physics , although with an important caveat that this is only done for the normal part of the matrix green s function .",
    "consequently , the results derived within this approach are also applicable to moderately disordered vortex solids .",
    "[ sec : greensol ]    hereafter we use @xmath73 to denote the spatially averaged electron green s function , @xmath74 .",
    "the approach we take here follows the standard practice @xcite of determining @xmath73 from the spatially averaged normalization condition , eq.([gnorm ] ) , g^2 - = -^2 .",
    "here we defined the average over vortex lattice of a product as = f_1 ( ) f_2 ( ) .",
    "the anomalous components of the green s function satisfy eqs.([eqf])-([eqf1 ] ) .",
    "formally , the solution is obtained by acting with the inverse of the differential operator in the right hand side on the product @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively . upon replacement of @xmath73 by its average , the operator acts solely on the order parameter ,    f ( , ; ) = & & 2 i g ( ; ) _ f ( , ; ) + ( , ; ) = & & 2 i g ( ; ) _ ^ * ( , ; ) , [ eq : bpt ]    where    [ eq : o ] _ f & = & [ -2 i + _",
    "f()(- i 2ec ( ) ) ] ^-1 , + _ ^ * & = & [ -2 i - _ f ( ) ( + i 2ec ( ) ) ] ^-1 .",
    "the strategy is to use a vortex lattice solution as an input , compute the anomalous green s functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 in terms of @xmath73 from eq.([eq : bpt ] ) , determine @xmath73 from the normalization condition , and then enforce the self - consistency on @xmath79 and the impurity self - energies . in principle , any complete set of basis functions is suitable for expanding both @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in practice , of course , we are looking for an expansion that can be truncated after very few terms , enabling efficient computation of the functions .",
    "the abrikosov lattice ansatz for @xmath82 is a superposition of the functions corresponding to the single vortex solution of the ginzburg - landau equations , and therefore it is natural to use these functions as our basis .    for an @xmath18-wave superconductor with an axisymmetric fermi surface ( isotropic in the plane normal to the field )",
    ", it is well known that the vortex lattice is given by a superposition of the single flux line solutions , the oscillator ( landau level , or ll ) functions , @xmath83 , centered at different points in the plane normal to the applied field @xcite @xmath84 here the symmetry of the coefficients @xmath85 determines the structure of the lattice .",
    "this form emerges from the solution of the linearized ginzburg - landau ( gl ) , and is also consistent with the solution of the linearized , with @xmath86 , quasiclassical equations .",
    "moreover , this form is valid down to low fields as the admixture of the contributions from higher landau levels , @xmath87 with @xmath88 , to @xmath82 remains negligible.@xcite consequently , the set of oscillator functions , @xmath87 , provides a convenient basis for the expansion of anomalous functions @xmath77 .",
    "it is common to rewrite the operator @xmath89 via the bosonic creation and annihilation operators , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "@xcite at the microscopic level , inserting this ansatz for @xmath82 into the quasiclassical equations , eqs.([eq : bpt ] ) , and enforcing the self - consistency condition , yields the order parameter which only includes the ground state oscillator functions , justifying use of eq .",
    "( [ avl : s ] ) @xcite .    in unconventional superconductors",
    "the situation is more complex . while the solution of the gl equations are still given by eq .",
    "( [ avl : s ] ) , this form is not a self - consistent solution of the linearized microscopic equations : the momentum and the real space dependence of the order parameter are coupled via the action of the operator @xmath92 . since the wave functions for landau levels form a complete set , they can still be used as a basis for the expansion .",
    "the microscopic equations mix different landau levels , and the self - consistent solution for the vortex state involves a linear combination of an infinite number of @xmath87 at each site @xcite . for the axisymmetric case the spatial structure of @xmath82 is still close to that for the @xmath18-wave case , and the weight of the higher landau levels in the self - consistent solution decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "hence in practice the series in @xmath10 is truncated either at @xmath93 ( as for @xmath18-wave ) or at the second non - vanishing term @xcite .",
    "while this is often sufficient to describe the salient features of the thermal and transport coefficients , care should be taken in determining the anisotropies of these coefficients under a rotated field : the anisotropy is often of the order of a percent , and the structure of the vortex lattice should therefore be determined to high accuracy as well .",
    "the situation is even more complex for unconventional superconductors with non - spherical fermi surface , when the fermi velocity is anisotropic in the plane normal to the applied field .",
    "quasi - two dimensional systems with the field in the plane , such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] , give one example of such difficulties .",
    "frequently in the microscopic theory the expansion is still carried out in the ll functions using the operators for the isotropic case .",
    "these functions are now strongly mixed , and hence ( numerically intensive ) inclusion of many ll is required before the self - consistency is reached .",
    "determining magnetization in the vortex state , for example , was carried out with 6 ll functions @xcite .",
    "this difficulty , however , is largely self - inflicted since , in contrast to the isotropic case , the ll functions in the form used in ref .",
    "are _ not _ the solutions to the linearized gl equations . for an arbitrary fermi surface the coefficients of the ginzburg - landau expansion",
    "are anisotropic , and the vortex lattice solution is given by the @xmath93 landau level in the rescaled , according to the anisotropy , coordinates .",
    "@xcite we show in appendix  [ app : gl ] that the proper rescaling is x = x/ , y = y , [ eq : xyscale ] where @xmath94 is a measure of the anisotropy of the fermi surface . for a fs with rotational symmetry around the axis @xmath95 , and for the field at an angle @xmath96 to this axis ,",
