    "recurrence intervals , defined as the time periods between consecutive extreme events , have been a topic of extensive research across many fields , financial markets in particular .",
    "the primary contribution of the published research is an understanding of the statistical regularities in recurrence intervals .",
    "the memory behavior in the underlying process strongly affects the distribution form of recurrence intervals @xcite .",
    "the interval distribution is exponential if the process has no memory . incorporating a long memory into the underlying process",
    "greatly alters the recurrence interval distribution .",
    "for example , the stretched exponential and weibull recurrence interval distribution are analytically and numerically confirmed in a process with a long linear memory @xcite .",
    "when a process has a long nonlinear memory ( a multifractual process ) , the recurrence intervals are power - law distributed @xcite .",
    "there is extensive literature that examines the empirical distribution of recurrence intervals in financial markets .",
    "the distribution form is found to be dependent on data source , data type , and data resolution .",
    "for example , recurrence interval distributions with a power - law tail are found in the daily volatilities in the japanese market @xcite , in the minute volatilities in the korean @xcite and italian markets @xcite , in the daily returns in the us stock markets @xcite , in the minute returns in the chinese markets @xcite , and in the minute volume in the us @xcite and chinese markets @xcite .",
    "in addition , stretched recurrence interval distributions are also observed in the financial volatility at different resolutions in a range of different markets @xcite . the @xmath0-exponential distribution has also been observed in the recurrence intervals between losses in financial returns @xcite , and the corresponding distribution in the chinese stock index future market is a stretched exponential @xcite .",
    "in addition to the inconsistent findings on the distribution of empirical recurrence intervals , the existence of scaling behaviors in the recurrence interval distribution for the extremes filtered by different thresholds is under debate . analyzing the distribution of recurrence intervals",
    "has indicated that the extreme event filtering threshold should influence the recurrence interval distribution @xcite .",
    "this indication was supported when the estimated distributional parameters were found to be strongly dependent on the thresholds when the recurrence intervals are fitted by such distribution functions as the stretched exponential distribution @xcite and the @xmath0-exponential distribution @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite propose that the distribution of recurrence intervals depends only on the mean recurrence interval @xmath2 , and not on a specific asset or on the time resolution of the data .",
    "only a limited amount of research has used recurrence interval analysis to assess and manage risks in financial markets .",
    "an improved method for estimating the value at risk ( var ) based on the recurrence interval is significantly more accurate than traditional estimates based on the overall or local return distributions @xcite .",
    "another way of predicting extremes using statistics of recurrence intervals is also superior to the precursory pattern recognition technique when the underlying process is multifractal @xcite . defining a conditional loss probability as the inverse of the expected waiting time before observing another extreme determined by the latest recurrence interval",
    ", @xcite finds that the risk of extreme loss events is high if the latest recurrence interval is long or short . in all of these studies , however , only in - sample tests are conducted , and a good performance in in - sample tests can not ensure good results in out - of - sample tests .",
    "in contrast , @xcite recently found that the extreme predicting method using recurrence interval analysis does provide good predictions in out - of - sample tests .",
    "such events as market crashes , currency crises , and bank failures are financial crisis in which the value of assets or the equity of financial institutions shrinks rapidly .",
    "financial crises shock the real - world economy and can cause recessions or depressions if left unchecked . to reduce investor losses and shocks to the economy and to reduce financial turbulence , much effort has gone into predicting financial extremes .",
    "there is a plethora of literature on forecasting financial crises , especially currency crises and bank failures , and most of the research relies on the early warning model ( ewm ) @xcite .",
    "the ewm identifies the leading indicators of emerging financial problems and uses such techniques as logit ( or probit ) regressions and intelligence approaches to translate them into the hazard probability of crises occurring in the future , which is used as an early warning signal that indicates whether a crisis is imminent .",
    "compared to the vast ewm research predicting bank failures and currency crisis , early warning models to monitor stock markets and provide warning signals of market extremes have received little attention .",
    "the contributions of the existing literature are as follows .",
    "a number of indicators are able to warn of incoming financial extremes .",
    "@xcite show that risk aversion indicators are useful in predicting stock market crises , but not currency crises .",
    "@xcite finds that such macroeconomic indicators as yield curve spreads and inflation rates can be used to predict stock market recessions .",
    "@xcite show that a global measure of liquidity can predict asset price booms .",
    "@xcite show that the price - to - book ratio can predict emerging price bubbles .",
    "@xcite show that such variables of index futures and options as the vix , open interest , dollar volume , put option price , and put option effective spread can predict equity market crises .",
    "@xcite define the average value at risk ( avars ) based on the arma - garch model with standard infinitely divisible innovations as an early warning indicator and find that avars can predict both extreme events and highly volatile markets . by constructing two investment networks based on the cross - border equity and a long - term debt securities portfolio , @xcite",
    "identify two network - based indicators ( algebraic connectivity and edge density ) that could have predicted the 2008 global financial crisis .",
    "@xcite show that the interconnectedness in the global network of financial linkages could have predicted the financial crises that occurred during the 19782010 period .",
    "composite indices averaged from crisis - related variables have been proposed to predict financial crises . @xcite",
    "propose a daily financial condition indicator , market volatility , to determine whether a stock market is unstable or not .",
    "@xcite define and propose a stock market instability index based on the difference between the current market condition and the past conditions when the market was stable .",
    "@xcite propose a model to predict stock market collapse that signals when a massive selling by global institutional investors occurs .",
    "@xcite integrate all crisis - related variables into a monthly financial market condition indicator and find that by using a support vector machine the indicator can detect market crises . @xcite use a market instability index to capture risk warning levels , quantify the instability level of the current market , and predict its future behavior",
    "there is a pattern of price trajectories that signals near - future market crashes .",
    "@xcite develops a log - periodic power law singularity ( lppls ) model for detecting bubbles by combining ( i ) the economic theory of rational expectation bubbles , ( ii ) the effect on the market of imitation and herding behaviors among investors and traders , and ( iii ) the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions .",
    "the faster - than - exponential ( power law with finite - time singularity ) increase in asset prices accompanied by accelerating oscillations is the main diagnostic that indicates bubbles @xcite .",
    "@xcite also corroborate that the lppls pattern can be used as an early warning signal for market crashes .",
    "in addition , @xcite convert the price series into networks using a visible graph alogorithm and use the degree - of - price network to measure the magnitude of the faster - than - exponential growth of stock prices , and to predict imminent financial extreme events . on average",
    "this indicator performs better than the lppls pattern - recognition indicator .",
    "the patterns of financial crises are modeled to predict financial extreme events .",
    "@xcite uncover the distribution pattern of waiting time between consecutive market extremes and use it to define a hazard probability that subsequent extremes will occur within a certain time period .",
    "they find that this hazard probability performs well in out - of - sample predictions . as an analogue to the seismic activity around earthquakes , @xcite",
    "adopt an epidemic - type aftershock sequence model ( a type of mutually self - exciting hawkes point process ) to capture the occurring dynamics of stock market crashes , which can serve as an early warning model for predicting the probability of medium - term crashes .",
    "we analyze the daily dow jones industrial average ( djia ) index from 16 february 1885 to 31 december 2015 .",
    "the logarithmic return of the djia index over a time scale of one day is defined @xmath3    figures  [ fig : index : return](a ) and [ fig : index : return](b ) show plots of the logarithmic djia and its return , respectively .",

    "definitions based on the quantile are common in the analysis of value - at - risk ( var ) .",
    "@xcite also define the 95% quantile of returns and the 95% quantile of negative returns as extremes and crashes .      by taking into consideration only the time in which extremes occur , we base our prediction of extreme returns on the hazard probability @xmath20 , which measures the probability that following an extreme return occurring at @xmath21 time in the past there is an additional waiting time @xmath22 before another extreme return occurs . @xcite and @xcite theoretically derived the hazard probability @xmath23 using the distribution of recurrence intervals between extreme events , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the probability distribution of the recurring intervals .",

    "although the recurrence intervals of poisson processes are exponentially distributed @xcite , which generates a constant hazard probability when @xmath22 is given , financial processes always exhibit such non - poissonian characteristics as long - term dependence and multifractality in volatilities @xcite , medium - term dependence ( e.g. , momentum and contrarian behaviors @xcite ) , and multiscaling behaviors in returns @xcite , which leads to that the recurrence intervals are no longer exponentially distributed , and that the derivation of the close distribution form for the recurrence intervals is obstructed @xcite .",
    "the non - poissonian features also result in a controversial situation in the empirical analysis of the distribution formula of recurrence intervals .",

    "when comparing the forecasted extremes with the actual events we see ( i ) correct predictions of an extreme return occurring , ( ii ) correct predictions of a non - extreme return occurring , ( iii ) missed events , and ( iv ) false alarms . by counting how many times each outcome occurs we can compute a range of evaluation measurements including the correct prediction rate , the false alarm rate , and the accuracy .",
    "our primary interest here is correct prediction rate @xmath41 and false alarm rate @xmath42 , which are defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of extreme returns that are correctly predicted , @xmath45 the number of non - extreme returns that are correctly predicted , @xmath46 the number of missed events , and @xmath47 the number of false alarms .",

    "the parameter @xmath51 is the investor preference for avoiding either type 1 or type 2 errors @xcite .",
    "we further define the usefulness of extreme forecasts as @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the loss faced by investors when they ignore the predictive signals , and @xmath54 is the extent to which the extreme forecasting model offers better performance than no model at all @xcite .",
    "extreme forecasts are useful when @xmath55 , which means that losses using the forecasts are lower than when the forecasts are ignored .",

    "table [ tb : ri : statistics ] lists the recurrence intervals for different thresholds from different calibrating periods .",
    "note that unlike the observations from the quantile threshold , the observations from the extreme value threshold do not increase monotonically as the calibration periods are expanded .",
    "the sharp decease in the number of recurrence intervals , for example from panel b to panel c for positive returns and from panel c to panel d for absolute returns , indicates that there is a dramatic increase in the extreme value threshold , suggesting that the market after 1973 became more volatile [ see fig .

    "in addition the autocorrelation of lag 5 is also positive when returns are positive .",
    "this indicates that there are autocorrelations at short and long lags in the recurrence intervals at the 95% quantile threshold . in the 99% column",
    "the autocorrelations are close to 0 and the ljung - box q statistics are insignificant for positive , negative , and absolute returns , suggesting that there are no correlations in the recurrence intervals .",

    "b through f , the autocorrelation coefficients at lags 1 and 5 are all positive and statistically significant , indicating the presence of strong autocorrelations in the recurrence intervals .",
    "in addition , the ljung - box q statistics of lag 30 are statistically significant at the 1% level , implying that significant autocorrelations are also prevalent when recurrence interval lags are longer .",

    "fourth , note that the predictions of the extreme returns in the 99% quantile produce a lower false alarm rate and a higher correct prediction rate than those in the 95% and 97.5% quantiles , and this produces high usefulness and kss scores .",

    "table  [ tb : ri : statistics ] shows the statistics of ljung - box q tests that exhibit a decreasing pattern as quantile thresholds increase in all panels , indicating that increasing the quantile threshold could decrease the memory strength in the extremes .",

    "<S> predicting such extreme financial events as market crashes , bank failures , and currency crises is of great importance to investors and policy markers because they destabilize the financial system and can greatly shrink asset value . </S>",
    "<S> much research has been carried out in an attempt to detect the underlying vulnerabilities and the common precursors to financial extremes . </S>",
    "<S> a number of different models have been developed to predict the occurrence of financial distresses including those using probability @xcite , signal approaches @xcite and intelligence @xcite . a faster - than - exponential increase in price accompanied by accelerating price oscillations </S>",

    "<S> the behavior of these bubbles can be characterized using the log - period power - law singularity ( lppls ) model , which is capable of accurately forecasting a bubble s tipping point @xcite .    recent research on the occurrence of financial extremes and on the market dynamics around financial crashes has enabled us to better forecast emerging financial crises . </S>",
    "<S> we can understand the occurrence pattern of extremes by determining the distribution of waiting times between consecutive financial extremes ( the `` recurrence intervals '' ) and charting the memory behavior within the occurring extremes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite built an early warning model of this waiting time distribution to predict the probability that extremes will occur within a given time period . </S>",
    "<S> following a financial crisis the financial system gradually transitions back to a stasis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this relaxation behavior following a financial market crash is similar to the aftershocks following an earthquake @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite indicates that a possible theoretical explanation for bursts of speculating bubbles is a positive herding behavior of traders that causes local self - excited crashes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in accordance with the phenomenon that extremes cluster and are interdependent . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite show that approximately 7685% of occurring extremes are triggered by other extremes , and they develop an early warning model that treats financial crashes as earthquakes and compute the probability that an extreme event will occur within a certain time period .    </S>",
    "<S> here we extend the probabilistic framework for extreme returns presented in @xcite to predict extremes by using the conditional probability of an future extreme event within a fixed time frame in which type 1 and type 2 errors are balanced in current market state . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions of our works are in four ways .    </S>",
    "<S> * we identify extremes by locating the threshold at the minimum ks value between the empirical and fitting distributions of the extreme values . </S>",
    "<S> * we classify the returns as either extreme or non - extreme by quantifying the extreme threshold , and we assume that the extremes are independent . </S>",
    "<S> this simplifies the modeling and reduces the computational complexity when estimating parameters but provides an adequate performance when doing out - of - sample prediction . </S>",
    "<S> * we define a hazard probability that is dependent on the distribution formula of recurrence intervals between extremes , and this translates the problem into finding a suitable distribution form for recurrence intervals . unlike the hawkes point process , our modeling framework is easy to implement . * instead of using a predefined threshold of hazard probability , we predict extremes when the hazard probability exceeds an optimized hazard threshold , obtained by maximizing a usefulness function that takes into account an investor s preference for either type 1 or type 2 errors .    </S>",
