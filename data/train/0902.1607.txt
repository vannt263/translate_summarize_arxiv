    "the highly excited matter created in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions expands very fast .",
    "it is commonly accepted that a deconfined phase has been reached in au+au collisions at rhic @xcite , while the onset of deconfinement has been advocated at sps energies @xcite .    while in lattice qcd calculations a static thermodynamic medium is assumed , in heavy ion collisions the situation is vastly different . here",
    ", the longitudinal expansion dynamics leads to a rapid passage from the deconfined to the confined phase . a system which undergoes the phase transition",
    "quickly may not follow the usual equilibrium scenario .",
    "in fact , for a first - order phase transition , the high temperature phase may survive down to temperatures drastically below the transition temperature , i.e.  the system supercools .",
    "if the expansion rate is faster than the nucleation rate of bubbles of the new phase , the system reaches the point of spinodal instabilitythis is the inflection point of the dependence of entropy on an extensive variable , see e.g. @xcite . .",
    "beyond such a point , entropy is gained if the system separates into two phases and so it becomes mechanically unstable .",
    "spinodal fragmentation connected with nuclear liquid / gas phase transition has been identified in heavy ion collisions at few hundred mev per nucleon @xcite , and it has been proposed that it might be the actual scenario at ultrarelativistic energies as well @xcite .",
    "fragmentation assumes that at the phase transition the system decays into droplets of smaller size .",
    "these droplets then emit hadrons .",
    "lattice calculations indicate , however , that at rhic and lhc the transition from partonic to hadronic matter is a rapid but smooth crossover @xcite .",
    "thus spinodal decomposition seems irrelevant scenario in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "conformal symmetry is broken close to the phase transition and as a consequence the _ bulk _ viscosity  being negligible otherwise  shows a peak here @xcite .",
    "bulk viscosity acts against the expansion and slows it down . as a result ,",
    "if the system previously accumulated kinetic energy due to expansion , it may fragment @xcite .",
    "an analysis of hydrodynamic instabilities shows that such a scenario may be realistic @xcite .",
    "hence , it appears that fragmentation may happen in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions .",
    "many kinds of observables might be sensitive to it .",
    "most notable are multiplicity fluctuations in varying rapidity windows @xcite , fluctuations of mean @xmath0 @xcite , rapidity correlations @xcite , proton and kaon correlations @xcite , @xmath1-meson production @xcite , and two - pion femtoscopy @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we inspect event - by - event fluctuations of rapidity distributions .",
    "if final state hadrons are emitted from droplets , their velocities will be close to those of the droplets .",
    "thus , clustering would appear in their momentum distribution .",
    "moreover , in each event clusters will have different velocities .",
    "an important contribution to clustering will also come from the resonance decays and we shall investigate this effect .",
    "thus , the momentum distribution will vary from event to event . specifically",
    ", here we shall compare _ rapidity distributions _ from different events and look for differences due to fireball fragmentation .",
    "to this end , we employ the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test which can be used for identification of non - statistical differences between two empirical distributions @xcite . an important advantage of the ks test is its independence from the underlying distribution of the measured quantity .    in the next section",
    "we shortly introduce the ks test . then",
    ", we illustrate its sensitivity by a couple of toy simulations . for more realistic studies we generate artificial data with the help of the event generator dragon @xcite",
    "which is very briefly introduced in section [ quag ] .",
    "results obtained with these data are presented in section [ results ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ conc ] . in the appendix we review the evaluation of the cummulative distribution function for the kolmogorov distribution .",
    "let us start by explaining the technical part of the problem .",
    "one has two empirical distributions in variable @xmath2 , which can be rapidity , @xmath0 , or yet something else , the ks test can not be applied and instead a modification known as kuiper test @xcitemust be employed . ] .",
    "( in the present work we work with rapidities . ) the multiplicities may differ .",
    "the question we want to ask is , whether the two empirical distributions are the same in the sense that they would correspond to the same underlying theoretical single - particle probability density , and there are no correlations between particles in one event .    .",
    "]    practically , the quantity @xmath2 is measured for each particle in an event . the empirical cummulative distribution function ( ecdf ) is constructed so that a step of the height @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the multiplicity of the event ) is made on all positions of measured @xmath2 s ( fig .  [",
    "f : ksd ] ) .",
    "this is done for both events of a pair .",
    "subsequently , one finds the _ maximum _ vertical distance between the two ecdf s and introduces @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance of two ecdf s and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the multiplicities of the two data sets .",
    "the procedure of the test is illustrated in figure  [ f : ksd ] .",
    "the cummulative distribution function of the _ kolmogorov distribution _ concerns the case of events generated from the same underlying theoretical probability distribution for the quantity @xmath2 , @xmath9 .",
    "it will be expressed with the help of the function @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the probability that we find a difference @xmath13 smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "an important feature of this approach is that @xmath10 does not depend on the particular shape of the theoretical distribution @xmath9 .",
    "unfortunately , the general form of @xmath10 valid for any multiplicities and distances @xmath14 is not suitable for practical evaluation .",
    "usable approximate expressions for @xmath10 are summarised in the appendix .",
    "it follows that if many pairs of events would be drawn from a set of events generated all from the same underlying probablility distribution and for each pair the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath10 would be determined , then the @xmath15 would be distributed _",
    "uniformly_. deviation from uniform distribution , particularly an enhanced population of low @xmath16 s ( large @xmath14 s ) indicates that the events are _ not drawn independently from the same underlying distribution_. in this way the ks test will be used here .",
    "note that the ks test does not identify the physical origin of the difference between the events .",
    "it is a robust way to identify that there is a difference , however , the origin must be singled out by other means .",
    "in addition to fireball fragmentation , these can be fluctuations of the initial state of the fireball evolution , final resonance decays , conservation laws , and quantum correlations .",
    "a detailed investigation of these will be pursued in subsequent papers .",
    "the important message of the ks test is , that it can disprove the usual paradigm that data from many collisions ( within the same centrality class ) are produced by basically identical fireballs .",
    "it is important to realise that the number of significant decimal figures to which the quantity @xmath2 ( rapidity here ) is measured may also influence the result of the ks test if it is applied on a large number of pairs of events .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ f : figures ] .",
    "s from the ks test applied on @xmath17 pairs out of @xmath17 events generated from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 in the variable @xmath2 ( rapidity ) and with multiplicities distributed according to poisson distribution with the mean 200 .",
    "different histograms correspond to rapidity data truncated after 2 , 4 , and 6 decimal places .",
    "the histogram with 8 significant figures is identical to that with 6 figures . ]",
    "the peak at @xmath18 increases with lowering the number of decimal places taken into account .",
    "the explanation is trivial but instructive .",
    "only rapidities between 0 and 1 were generated .",
    "within @xmath17 events , each having multiplicity around 200 , there are about @xmath19 particles . hence ,",
    "if their values of @xmath2 are given to less than 8 figures , we are guaranteed to have repeating values of @xmath2 in our sample . for 6 given figures",
    "we expect each value to appear on average 20 times , for 4 figures it is 2000 times and for 2 figures we are even at 200,000 times !",
    "clearly , this effect correlates the events since it artificially chooses @xmath2 from a finite number of possible values .",
    "according to its construction , the @xmath6 s will acquire smaller values on average .",
    "we have also checked that the normal fluctuation of the number of entries in a bin of the @xmath16-histogram is equal to the square root of the number of entries .",
    "we thus propose the use of quantity @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of pairs in the first bin of the @xmath16-histogram ( next to @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 is the total number of pairs , @xmath24 is the number of bins of the @xmath16-histogram , and @xmath25 is the expected variance of the number of entries in the first bin .",
    "the modulus of @xmath26 should be of the order 1 ; values considerably bigger than that indicate non - statistical differences between the events .",
    "in this section we study how the proposed method works in case of clear cut examples .",
    "first , we generate samples of `` events '' where one half of all events is generated according to gaussian distribution with the width @xmath27 . for the second half of events we keep the same width and vary the mean : we have samples with the mean shifted with respect to the other half by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . in figure",

    "we observe how the ks procedure recognises the difference of @xmath31 pretty well if the average multiplicity is 512 , and how the resolution power decreases when lowering the multiplicity to 32 .",
    "as seen in the smaller inset plot , for smaller distances between the two gaussian means the difference is not recognised , while for larger distance the difference is resolved by the test for all multiplicities .    in figure",

    "( for the setting without droplets ( i.e.  only bulk emission ) this low @xmath16 enhancement is strongly suppressed .",
    "quantitatively , this is reflected in a factor of 10 difference of the extracted @xmath26 values .",
    "the rhic results without droplet formation are also in line with the results obtained at fair energies , showing that the ks test does not produce falsly positive results when going to smaller samples with a different rapidity distribution .",
    "resonance decays also have a clustering effect on the decay products .",
    "therefore , a signal of clustering is also seen in the set of events without droplets . in case of all hadrons , these are mainly @xmath68 s and @xmath69 s .",
    "if we limit our analysis to pions only , then there is correlation due to the @xmath68 . to test this hypothesis",
    ", one can perform the ks test with protons only , since there is no resonance that would decay into two baryons .",
    "the drawback of using protons only is limited statistics in two ways .",
    "firstly , their total multiplicity is lower , e.g.  there are only 10 to 50 protons in the acceptance per rhic event .",
    "therefore , one observes fewer pairs at small @xmath16 and a peak at @xmath16 close to 1 in case there are no droplets ( see appendix ) .",
    "secondly , if the droplets are small , protons are a less ideal probe because a droplet may not have enough energy to emit more than one proton and the correlation is gone then .",
    "an alternative solution is to use pions of the same charge .",
    "these are more abundant than protons and no strong effect of resonances is seen here .",
    "note , however , that we have not included the effect of pair wave function symmetrisation which leads to bose - einstein correlations .",
    "note also , that resonances not only introduce correlations , they can also weaken the correlations due to droplets .",
    "resonance decay products obtain some momentum due to higher mass of the mother resonance .",
    "thus , the velocities of decay products will be more smeared around the velocity of the droplet which emitted the resonance than the velocities of hadrons emitted from the droplet directly .",

    "we do the ks test with charged hadrons .",
    "as expected from previous analysis ( with @xmath71 ) , a dominant low @xmath16 peak emerges for all droplet volumes down to 5  @xmath62 . from this",
    "we conclude that even small size droplets can be detected with the analysis method presented here .    as a final physics benchmark of the ks test we explore the effect of changing droplet fraction of the total multiplicity . a systematic study of how the percentage of hadrons emitted from droplets affects the result",

    "even if only one quarter of all hadrons comes from the droplets and the rest from the gas in between them , the signal is well visible and the ks test can discriminate between the formation and the non - formation of droplets .",
    "finally , we address the experimentally crucial question whether the droplet signal in the @xmath16-histogram stays recognisable if the rapidities are measured with finite resolution .",
    "we investigate this issue in figure  [ f : reso ] .     and 50% of hadrons generated from droplets .",

    "the events with smeared rapidities are then processed with the ks test .",
    "we observe a gradual weakening of the signal strength at low @xmath16 . for smearing by 0.5 units of rapidity",
    "the peak height becomes comparable with the peak resulting from resonance decays only ( cf .",
    "figure  [ f : simpquag ] ) . for even poorer resolution",
    ", the peak can not be regarded as an unambiguous signal for droplet formation .",
    "the resolution , however , is usually on the level of @xmath73 .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov test is a powerful tool in searching for non - statistical differences between events .",
    "the test itself is more general than investigated here , and applications will be presented in following papers .",
    "the logic of its use is the following : select a class of events which are `` as identical as possible '' , in particular in a very narrow centrality class .",
    "conventional scenarios predict that each event would evolve according to the same scenario and the final distributions of hadrons would be identical in all events .",
    "the ks test is able to detect deviations from this scenario .",
    "if an effect is observed , it remains to be studied what phenomenon leads to positive results .    as a currently widely discussed topic we focussed the present investigation on the possible decay of the fireball into smaller droplets .",
    "the present study showed that the ks test is perfectly suited for this task and allows to extract a prominent signal .",
    "the signal is robust even if only a small amount of the hadrons come from the droplets and survives realistic final rapidity resolution .",
    "thus , the test can be also used in a negative way : if its application on data yields only limited or no signature of non - statistical event - by - event fluctuations of the rapidity distributions , this puts limits on the scenarios assuming fireball fragmentation .",

    "<S> we propose an application of the kolmogorov - smirnov test for rapidity distributions of individual events in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the test is particularly suitable to recognise non - statistical differences between the events . </S>",
    "<S> thus when applied to a narrow centrality class it could indicate differences between events which would not be expected if all events evolve according to the same scenario . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , as an example we assume here a possible fragmentation of the fireball into smaller pieces at the quark / hadron phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> quantitative studies are performed with a monte carlo model capable of simulating such a distribution of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the kolmogorov - smirnov test is a very powerful tool for the identification of the fragmentation process . </S>"
