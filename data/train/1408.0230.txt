    "the gross - pitaevski ( gp ) equation and its multicomponent generalizations are important tools for analyzing and studying the dynamics of the bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , see the monographs @xcite and the numerous references therein among which we mention @xcite . in the 3-dimensional case these equations can be analyzed solely by numerical methods .",
    "if we assume that bec is quasi - one - dimensional then the gp equations mentioned above may be reduced to the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) perturbed by the external potential @xmath0 @xmath1 or to its vector generalizations ( vnlse ) @xmath2 the manakov model ( mm ) @xcite is a two - component vnlse with @xmath3 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the analytical approach to the @xmath4-soliton interactions was proposed by zakharov and shabat @xcite for the scalar nlse , for a vector nlse see @xcite .",
    "they treated the case of the exact @xmath4-soliton solution where all solitons had different velocities .",
    "they calculated the asymptotics of the @xmath4-soliton solution for @xmath5 and proved that both asymptotics are sums of @xmath4 one - soliton solutions with the same sets of amplitudes and velocities .",
    "the effects of the interaction were shifts in the relative center of masses and phases of the solitons . the same approach , however , is not applicable to the mm , because the asymptotics of the soliton solution for @xmath6 do not commute .",
    "the present paper is an extension of @xcite where the main result is that the @xmath4-soliton interactions in the adiabatic approximation for the manakov model can also be modeled by the ctc @xcite .",
    "more specifically , here we continue our analysis of the effects of external potentials on the soliton interactions . while in @xcite we studied the effects of periodic , harmonic and anharmonic potentials ,",
    "here we consider potential wells and humps of the form : @xmath7 if @xmath8 is negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) @xmath9 is a well ( resp .",
    "hump ) with width 1.7 at half - height / depth . adjusting one or more terms in ( [ eq : iru ] ) with different @xmath10 and @xmath11 we can describe wells and/or humps with different widths / depths and positions .    in the present paper we in fact prove the hypothesis in @xcite and extend the results in @xcite concerning the model of soliton interactions of vector nlse ( [ eq : vnls ] ) in adiabatic approximation .",
    "the corresponding vector @xmath4-soliton train is a solution of ( [ eq : vnls ] ) determined by the initial condition : @xmath12 with @xmath13 where the @xmath14-component polarization vector @xmath15 is normalized by the conditions @xmath16 the adiabatic approximation holds true if the soliton parameters satisfy @xcite : @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the average amplitude and velocity , respectively .",
    "in fact we have two different scales : latexmath:[\\[|\\nu _ k-\\nu _ 0| \\simeq \\varepsilon_0^{1/2 } , \\qquad |\\mu _ k-\\mu _ 0| \\simeq \\varepsilon_0^{1/2 } , \\qquad     we remind that the basic idea of the adiabatic approximation is to derive a dynamical system for the soliton parameters which would describe their interaction .",
    "this idea was initiated by karpman and solovev @xcite and modified by anderson and lisak @xcite .",
    "later this idea was generalized to @xmath4-soliton interactions @xcite and the corresponding dynamical system for the @xmath22-soliton parameters was identified as a @xmath4-site complex toda chain ( ctc ) .",
    "the fact that the ctc , ( just like its real counterpart  the toda chain ) is completely integrable gives additional possibilities .",
    "a detailed comparative analysis between the solutions of the rtc and ctc @xcite shows that the ctc allows for a variety of asymptotic regimes , see section 3 below .",
    "more precisely , knowing the initial soliton parameters one can effectively predict the asymptotic regime of the soliton train .",
    "another possible use of the same fact is , that one can describe the sets of soliton parameters responsible for each of the asymptotic regimes .",
    "another important advantage of the adiabatic approach consists in the fact , that one may consider the effects of various perturbations on the soliton interactions @xcite .",
    "the next step was to extend this approach to treat the soliton interactions of the manakov solitons .",
    "more precisely , using the method of anderson and lisak @xcite we derive a generalized version of the complex toda chain ( ctc ) ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq:141.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : q_k ] ) below ) as a model describing the behavior of the @xmath4-soliton trains of of the vnlse ( [ eq : vnls ] ) @xcite .",
    "this generalized ctc includes dependence on the polarization vectors @xmath23 .",
    "it allows us to analyze how the changes of the polarization vectors influence the soliton interactions .",
    "besides , the generalized ctc is also integrable with the consequence that one can predict the asymptotic regimes of the manakov solitons and can describe the sets of soliton parameters that are responsible for each of the asymptotic regimes .",
    "of course , just like for the scalar case , one can also analyze the effects of the various perturbations on the soliton interactions .",
    "in section 2 we outline how the variational approach developed in @xcite can be used to derive the perturbed ctc ( pctc ) model @xcite for @xmath24-type external potentials .",
    "we also remind the reader about the asymptotic regimes of the soliton trains predicted by the ctc @xcite . in section 3",
    "we briefly treat the @xmath4-soliton interactions of the mm without external potential . obviously",
    "in order to determine the @xmath4-soliton train for the mm , along with the usual sets of solitons parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 we need also the set of polarization vectors @xmath27 . in section 4",
    "we derive the effects of the external potentials on the soliton interactions .",
    "this is a perturbed form of the ctc ( pctc ) for generic potentials of the form ( [ eq : iru ] ) .",
    "section 5 is dedicated to the comparison between the numeric solutions of the perturbed vnlse ( [ eq : vnls ] ) with the predictions of the pctc model . to this end",
    "we solve the vnlse numerically by using an implicit scheme of crank - nicolson type in complex arithmetic .",
    "the concept of the internal iterations is applied ( see @xcite ) in order to ensure the implementation of the conservation laws on difference level within the round - off error of the calculations @xcite .",
    "the solutions of the relevant pctc have been obtained using maple . knowing the numeric solution @xmath28 of the perturbed vnlse we calculate he maxima of @xmath29 ,",
    "compare them with the ( numeric solutions ) for @xmath30 of the pctc and plot the presdicted by both models trajectories for each of the solitons .",
    "thus we are able to analyze the effects of the external potentials on the soliton interactions . finally , sections 6 and 7 contain discussion and conclusions .",
    "here we briefly remind the derivation of the ctc as a model describing the @xmath4-soliton interactions vnls systems using the variational approach @xcite .      the perturbed vector nlse ( [ eq : vnls ] )",
    "allows hamiltonian formulations with the poisson brackets @xmath31 and the hamiltonian @xmath32.\\ ] ] it also admits a lagrangian of the form : @xmath33 - h.\\ ] ]    in what follows we will analyze the large time behavior of the @xmath4-soliton train determined as the solution of the vnlse by the initial condition ( [ eq : nstr ] ) , ( [ eq : nstr2 ] ) .    the idea of the variational approach of @xcite is to insert the anzatz ( [ eq : nstr ] ) into the lagrangian , perform the integration over @xmath34 and retain only terms of the orders of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the first obvious observation is that only the nearest neighbors solitons will contribute such terms and @xmath37 here @xmath38 correspond to the terms involving only the @xmath18-th soliton ( see @xcite ) : @xmath39 finally the terms describing soliton - soliton interactions are given by : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the next step is to consider @xmath43 ( [ eq : l ] ) as a lagrangian of the dynamical system , describing the motion of the @xmath4-soliton train and providing the equations of motion for the @xmath44 ( @xmath45 for the manakov case ) soliton parameters .",
    "let us first consider the unperturbed case , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath3 . deriving the dynamical system",
    "we get terms of three different orders of magnitude : ( i )  terms of order @xmath46 ; ( ii )  terms of order @xmath47 and ( iii )  terms of order @xmath48 . however the terms of types ( i ) and ( ii ) are multiplied by factors that are of the order of @xmath48 due to the evolution equations for the soliton parameters .",
    "finally , we arrive at the following set of dynamical equations for the soliton parameters : @xmath49 in addition we obtain also a system of equations for the evolution of the polarization vectors : @xmath50 + c_k\\vec{n}_k .\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath51 are fixed up by the constraints on the polarization vectors .",
    "indeed , from @xmath52 for all @xmath53 one finds that @xmath54 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the constants @xmath51 are purely imaginary .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath55 . then from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n - k2 ] ) and ( [ eq:139.6 ] ) we find that @xmath56 become time - dependent and up to terms of the order of @xmath57 evolve linearly with time : @xmath58 .",
    "but such evolution is compatible with the second normalization condition in ( [ eq : n - k2 ] ) only if @xmath59 ; therefore @xmath60 .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:139.2 ] ) we get : @xmath61,\\ ] ] where @xmath62    besides , from ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) and ( [ eq : q_k ] ) there follows ( see @xcite ) : @xmath63 and @xmath64,\\ ] ] which proves the statement in @xcite .",
    "( [ eq:141.3 ] ) , combined with the system of equations for the polarization vectors ( [ eq:139.6 ] ) provides the proper generalization of the ctc model for the mnls .",
    "the equations for the polarization vectors are nonlinear .",
    "so the whole system of equations for @xmath65 and @xmath23 seems to be rather complicated and nonintegrable even for the unperturbed mnls .",
    "however , all terms in the right hand sides of the evolution equations for @xmath23 are of the order of @xmath57 .",
    "this allows us to neglect the evolution of @xmath23 and to approximate them with their initial values . as a result",
    "we obtain that the @xmath4-soliton interactions for the vnlse in the adiabatic approximation are modeled by the ctc , see section 3 .",
    "it is easy to see , that if all @xmath66 then the ctc ( [ eq:141.3 ] ) is a completely integrable dynamical system , just like the real toda chain .",
    "note also that the ctc models the soliton interactions for the vnlse with _ any number of components_. the effect of the polarization vectors on the interaction comes into ctc only through the scalar products @xmath67 .",
    "it is well known , that a gauge transformation @xmath68 with any constant unitary matrix @xmath69 leaves the vnlse , eq .",
    "( [ eq : vnls ] ) invariant .",
    "such transformation will change all polarization vectors simultaneously @xmath70 but preserves their scalar products , and so will not influence the soliton interaction .",
    "obviously , our ctc model is invariant under such transformations . due to the above arguments our choice of the initial values of @xmath71",
    "can be changed into @xmath72 with no effect on the interaction .",
    "that is why we specify only the scalar products @xmath73 for our runs , which we have chosen to be real .",
    "now we consider the effects of the external potentials of the form ( [ eq : iru ] ) . to this end",
    "we have to calculate the integrals in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq:123.2 ] ) and see how they would change the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ eq:139.2 ] ) .",
    "as it is clear from above , we have to replace @xmath74 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:123.2 ] ) by @xmath75 while @xmath76 remains unchanged .",
    "thus we obtain the following pctc system :    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 .    as a result for our specific choice of @xmath0",
    "we get : @xmath82 where @xmath83 and the integrals describing the interaction of the solitons with the potential ( see figure [ fig15](left panel ) ) @xmath84 the details of deriving the integrals are given in the appendix .",
    "the corrections to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , coming from the terms linear in @xmath87 depend only on the parameters of the @xmath88-th soliton ; _ i.e. _ , they are ` local ' in @xmath88 .",
    "the fact that the @xmath4-soliton trains for the scalar nlse are modeled by an integrable model ",
    "ctc allowed one to to predict their asymptotic behavior . the method to do so",
    "was based on the exact integrability of the ctc @xcite and on its lax representation .    here",
    "we shall show , that similar results hold true also for the ctc ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) modeling the soliton trains of the mm .",
    "indeed , following moser  @xcite we introduce the lax pair @xmath89 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 here the matrices @xmath91 , and @xmath92 whenever one of the indices becomes 0 or @xmath93 ; the other notations in ( [ eq : k.3 ] ) are as follows : @xmath94 one can check that the compatibility condition eq .",
    "( [ eq : k.3 ] ) with @xmath95 and @xmath96 as in ( [ eq : lb ] ) is equivalent to the unperturbed ctc ( [ eq:139.2 ] ) .",
    "the first consequence of the lax representation is that the ctc has @xmath4 complex - valued integrals of motion provided by the eigenvalues of @xmath95 which we denote by @xmath97 , @xmath98 .",
    "indeed the lax equation means that the evolution of @xmath95 is isospectral , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath99 .    another important consequence from the results of moser @xcite is that for the real toda chain one can write down explicitly its solutions in terms of the scattering data , which consist of @xmath100 where @xmath101 are the first components of the properly normalized eigenvectors of @xmath102 @xcite . for the real toda chain",
    "both @xmath103 and @xmath101 are real ; besides all @xmath104 are different",
    ". next moser calculated the asymptotics of these solutions for @xmath105 and showed that @xmath106 determine the asymptotic velocities of the particles .",
    "the formulae derived by moser can easily be extended to the complex case @xcite .",
    "the important difference is that all important ingredients such as eigenvalues @xmath104 and first components of the eigenvectors of @xmath95 normalized to 1 now become complex valued .",
    "in addition , the important asset of @xmath95 for the rtc , namely that all eigenvalues are real and different , is also lost .",
    "however the asymptotics of the solutions for @xmath105 can be calculated with the result : @xmath107 where @xmath108 in ( [ eq : l.1 ] ) is some real positive constant which is estimated by the minimal difference between the asymptotic velocities .",
    "equating the real parts in eq .",
    "( [ eq : l.1 ] ) we obtain : @xmath109 which means that the real parts @xmath106 of the eigenvalues of @xmath95 determine the asymptotic velocities for the ctc .",
    "this fact will be used to classify the regimes of asymptotic behavior .",
    "let us also point out the important differences between rtc and ctc , namely :    d1 ) : :    while for rtc @xmath110 , @xmath111 and    @xmath112 are all real , for ctc they generically take    complex values , e.g. @xmath113 ; d2 ) : :    while for rtc @xmath114 for    @xmath115 , for ctc no such restriction holds .    as a consequence",
    "we find that the only possible asymptotic behavior in the rtc is the asymptotically free motion of the solitons . for ctc",
    "it is @xmath116 that determines the asymptotic velocity of the @xmath88-th soliton . for simplicity and without loss of generality",
    "we assume that : @xmath117 ; @xmath118 for @xmath115 ; and @xmath119 .",
    "then we have :    afr : :    the asymptotically free regime takes place if    @xmath120 for @xmath115 ,    _ i.e. _ , the asymptotic velocities are all different .",
    "then we have    asymptotically separating , free solitons , see also @xcite ; bsr : :    the bound state regime takes place for    @xmath121 , _",
    "i.e. _ , all @xmath122 solitons move with the same mean    asymptotic velocity , and form a  bound state \" .",
    "the key question now    will be the nature of the internal motions in such a bound state : is    it quasi - equidistant or not ?",
    "mar : :    a variety of intermediate situations , or mixed asymptotic regimes    happen when one group ( or several groups ) of particles move with the    same mean asymptotic velocity ; then they would form one ( or several )    bound state(s ) and the rest of the particles will have free asymptotic    motion .    obviously the regimes ( ii ) and ( iii ) , as well as",
    "the degenerate and singular cases , which we do not consider here have no analogies in the rtc and physically are qualitatively different from i ) .",
    "the perturbed ctc taking into account the effects of the @xmath24-like potentials to the best of our knowledge is not integrable and does not allow lax representation .",
    "therefore we are applying numeric methods to solve it .",
    "in this section we will compare how well the pctc model derived above predicts the soliton interactions as solutions of the mm with the external potentials of kind . before",

    "this regime takes place if the initial    amplitudes are given by eq .",
