    "the shape of the gamma - ray burst s ( grb s ) @xmath0 ms resolution lightcurves in the batse gamma - ray burst catalog @xcite carry an immense amount of information .",
    "however , the chaging s / n ratio complicates the detailed comparative analysis of the lightcurves . during the morphological analysis of the grb",
    "s @xcite a subclass with fast rise - exponential decay ( fred ) pulse shape were observed .",
    "this shape is quite attractive because its fenomenological simplicity .",
    "here we use a special wavelet transformation with a kernel function based on a fred - like pulse .",
    "similar approach have been used by @xcite , but their base functions were constructed differently .",
    "we have used the discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) matrix formalism ( e.g. @xcite ) : here for an input data vector @xmath1 , the one step of the wavelet transform is a multiplication with a special matrix @xmath2 : @xmath3\\ ] ] where the @xmath4 are the 4-stage fir filter parameters defining the wavelet . to obtain these values",
    "we require the matrix @xmath2 to be orthogonal ( e.g. no information loss ) , and the output of the even ( derivating - like ) rows should disappear for a constant and for a fred - like @xmath5 input signal .",
    "these requirements give two different solutions for @xmath4 : a rapidly oscillating one and a smooth one . in the following",
    "we ll use the later one .",
    "our filter process with the fred wavelet transform consists of the usual @xmath6 digital filtering steps . during the filtering we ll loose some information",
    ", however this could be quite small . to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm on fig .  1 .",
    "we reconstructed the 100 - 320 kev 64ms ligthcurve of batse trigger 0143 from the biggest 5% of the total wavelet coefficients .",
    "the excellent reconstruction of each individual pulse is obvious .",
    "the wavelet transformation algorithm divides the phase - space into equal area regions . on fig .  2 .",
    "the wavelet transform are shown . here",
    "the dark segments are the really important coefficients - however they cover only a small portion of the total area which explains the high efficiency of the reconstruction .",
    "for a frequency - like wavelet scale analysis we would like to create a power - spectrum like distribution along the frequency axis",
    ". however , one should be careful . in the classical signal",
    "processing one uses the power spectrum from the fourier - transform , because the signals are electromagnetic - like usually , e.g. the power ( or energy ) is proportional to the square of the signal . here",
    "the lightcurves measure photon counts  so the signal s energy is simply the sum of the counts .",
    "for this reason we approximate the signal s strength as a sum the magnitude of the coefficients along the given frequency rows .",
    "this signal s strength indicate on fig  3 .",
    "( batse trigger 0143 ) the maximum power to be around @xmath7 . in each energy channel",
    "the signals are similar ( observe the logarithmic scale ) , because the signal is strong even at high energies ( channel 4 ) . for batse trigger 7343 ( with optical redshift @xmath8 ) one can observe a strong high frequency cutoff : some of the signal s high frequency part is missing .",
    "however all the 4 channels are visible , while the maximum power is around @xmath9 .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the signal s shape is quite similar to trigger 0143 if that is scaled down by a factor of @xmath10 in frequency .",
    "the fred wavelet transform measures the similarity between the different wavelet kernel functions ( here all are fred - based ) and the actual signal . to quantify the similarity we define a magnitude cutoff in the wavelet space so , that the _ reconstructed _ @xmath11 value from the filtered data should be similar to the original values .",
    "the @xmath11 value and its @xmath12 error from the photon count statistics could be easily determined from the original ligthcurve . to keep only the important features we define the @xmath13 breakpoint where @xmath14 using a cut - off point it is possible to define a compressed size ( cs ) for a burst : it is the number of bins ( in the wavelet space ) needed to restore the curve at the break .",
    "the cs value is a robust measure quantifying the similarity between the fred kernel and the different channels lightcurves .",
    "our analysis suggest that all the low energy channels # 1 , # 2 and # 3 behaves similarly , while the high energy ( @xmath15 kev ) channel is different ( which is not very surprising , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "4 . shows the _ ratio _ of the cs s against the total count lightcurves cs for channels 2 and 4 .",
    "this distributions indicate that the pulse - shapes in the long bursts high energy channel are more fred - like than the lower ones - and this is _ independent _ from the actual fred time - scale !",
