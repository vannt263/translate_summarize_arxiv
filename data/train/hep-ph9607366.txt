    "in the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet )  @xcite ( see  @xcite for reviews ) , the heavy - quark spin does not interact with gluons to leading order in @xmath2 ( where @xmath9 is the heavy - quark mass ) .",
    "therefore , this spin can be rotated ( spin symmetry ) or even switched off ( superflavour symmetry  @xcite ) without affecting the dynamics . in the heavy - quark limit ,",
    "the properties of the doublet of the ground - state pseudoscalar and vector mesons @xmath10 are therefore characterized by the spin - parity quantum numbers @xmath11 of the light degrees of freedom  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall use the superflavour symmetry to describe the ground - state mesons by a dirac wave function .",
    "however , we collect in appendix  a the most important formulae using a more conventional formalism .",
    "let @xmath12 be a scalar field describing a heavy antiquark moving at four - velocity @xmath13 with its spin switched off .",
    "then the decay constant @xmath14 of a heavy meson ( moving at the same velocity ) is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the dirac wave function of the meson , which satisfies @xmath17 a non - relativistic ( i.e.  mass independent ) normalization of @xmath16 and @xmath18 is assumed . in the heavy - quark limit , the relation between @xmath14 and the usual meson decay constants reads @xmath19    to leading order in @xmath2 , current - induced transitions between two ground - state mesons are described by a single isgur - wise form factor  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath13 , @xmath21 are the meson velocities . at next - to - leading order ,",
    "there appear @xmath2 corrections to the currents and to the lagrangian of the hqet  @xcite .",
    "the first type of corrections can be expressed via the matrix element of a dimension - four operator : and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the gluon field . ]",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 the equations of motion , @xmath26 , can be employed to relate @xmath27 to @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the result is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the `` binding energy '' , i.e.  the difference between the meson mass and the heavy - quark mass .",
    "hence , there is only one new independent form factor .",
    "the @xmath2 corrections to the lagrangian give rise to the matrix elements of two non - local operators : @xmath31 where @xmath32=i g_s t_a g_a^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] is the gluon field strength , and ( @xmath33 $ ] ) @xmath34 in the second matrix element in ( [ chidef ] ) , the indices @xmath35 and @xmath36 are restricted to the subspace orthogonal to @xmath13 .",
    "explicit expressions for the meson form factors in terms of the functions @xmath37 , @xmath28 and @xmath38 can be found in  @xcite . at moderate values of @xmath39",
    ", these functions have been studied extensively in the framework of qcd sum rules , both at leading  @xcite and next - to - leading @xcite order in the heavy - quark expansion . in the present paper",
    ", we shall consider the behaviour of the form factors in the large - recoil region @xmath3 .",
    "this region is inaccessible in the weak semileptonic decays , but it can be explored ( at least in principle ) in the production reaction @xmath40 .",
    "using methods developed for hard exclusive processes , we calculate the asymptotic behaviour of the form factors in a model - independent way .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : for @xmath3 , there is a large momentum transfer to the light quark : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is of the order of a typical hadronic mass scale . as shown in fig .",
    "[ ffdiag]a , this momentum is transferred by the exchange of a hard gluon , and the methods developed for hard exclusive processes in qcd  @xcite ( see  @xcite for reviews ) are applicable . in the `` brick wall '' frame , where @xmath43 , the projection of the total angular momentum on the @xmath44 axis ( directed along @xmath45 ) is equal to the projection of the meson spin .",
    "( recall that the heavy - quark spin has been switched off . )",
    "since it is conserved , the meson helicity changes its sign  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the isgur  wise form factor is thus determined by the interference between the leading - twist ( quark  antiquark ) wave function and the subleading - twist ( quark  antiquark and quark  antiquark  gluon ) wave functions .",
    "it is given by @xmath46 indeed , the situation is similar to the well - known case of the @xmath47@xmath48 form factor  @xcite . at order @xmath2 in the heavy - quark expansion ,",
    "there are however contributions involving the leading - twist wave function only .",
    "they conserve the meson helicity and behave as @xmath49 the leading contribution in the heavy - quark expansion , which is given by the isgur  wise function , dominates as long as @xmath50 . for @xmath1 , however , the contributions of @xmath28 and @xmath51 in ( [ i9 ] ) become the dominant ones .",
    "note that they violate the heavy - quark spin symmetry , i.e.  they contribute in a non - universal way to the various meson form factors .",
    "higher - order terms in the heavy - quark expansion ( of order @xmath52 and higher ) can not fall off slower than @xmath53 because this behaviour corresponds to the leading twist , and hence they always remain small corrections .",
    "it is instructive to consider the same situation from an opposite point of view . at",
    "asymptotically large values @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the momentum transferred to the mesons , and @xmath56 is the momentum fraction carried by the light quark ) , the form factor of a heavy meson behaves like that of the pion  @xcite : @xmath57 which exactly corresponds to  ( [ i9 ] ) .",
    "however , there is a contribution to the subleading - twist ( @xmath58 ) correction which is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "it becomes important for moderate values of @xmath60 : @xmath61 this contribution exactly corresponds to  ( [ i8 ] ) .",
    "it dominates for @xmath62 .",
    "higher - twist ( @xmath63 and higher ) corrections can not be more enhanced than @xmath59 because otherwise the form factor would diverge in the heavy - quark limit , and hence they always remain small corrections .    until now",
    ", we considered form factors for transitions induced by a current containing heavy quarks only . in the case of , say , the electromagnetic current , which also contains light - quark fields , contributions of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ ffdiag]b appear .",
    "however , they lead to the behaviour @xmath64 and can thus be safely neglected , since @xmath65 for a heavy quark .    in summary , for @xmath66 the dominant contribution to meson form factors comes from the universal isgur",
    " wise function .",
    "it involves the exchange of a longitudinal hard gluon and a change of the meson helicity , corresponding to the interference between the leading- and subleading - twist wave functions . for @xmath1 , on the other hand , the situation is the same as in massless qcd .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of meson form factors is determined by leading - twist contributions , which are not universal .",
    "they are governed by the exchange of a hard transverse gluon , which conserves the meson helicity .",
    "the sum of these two contributions describes the asymptotic behaviour of the form factors in the whole region @xmath3 .",
    "the simple picture described here is only slightly modified by the emission of gluon bremsstrahlung , which can be dealt with in renormalization - group improved perturbation theory .",
    "it leads to an additional , moderate power suppression of the form factors at large recoil .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ wf ] , we introduce the ( quark  antiquark ) meson wave functions of leading and subleading twist , @xmath67 . unlike in qcd , wave functions defined in the hqet depend on a dimensional argument @xmath68 .",
    "we investigate the moments of these wave functions and derive the symmetry relations between the various meson wave functions , which arise in the heavy - quark limit . in sec .",
    "[ evol ] , we derive the evolution equations for @xmath67 , which are analogous to the brodsky ",

    "this calculation extends the calculation of the hqet anomalous dimension of local heavy - light current operators  @xcite . a new kind of ultraviolet divergence appears in the relation between the local operators and the operators defining the wave function .",
    "therefore , the brodsky ",
    "lepage kernels do not determine the renormalization properties of the local operators completely .",
    "a similar situation is encountered in the case of the ( altarelli  parisi ) equations describing the evolution of distribution functions in the hqet  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sr ] , we investigate the properties of the wave functions @xmath67 using the qcd sum - rule approach .",

    "[ iw2 ] , we apply our results to derive the leading asymptotic behaviour of meson form factors at large recoil .",
    "first , we calculate the contribution of the interference between the leading - twist and the ( quark  antiquark ) subleading - twist wave functions to the asymptotic behaviour of the isgur  wise function .",

    "then we calculate the leading - twist contributions to the form factors appearing at order @xmath2 in the heavy - quark expansion . finally , in sec .  [ apps ]",
    "we discuss the implications of our results for the reactions @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "technical details of our calculations are presented in four appendices .",
    "before we proceed , some comments on the existing literature on the application of perturbative qcd to the calculation of heavy - meson form factors are in order .",
    "a simple model of a meson made out of two heavy quarks with unequal masses was considered in  @xcite .",
    "there it was noted that some form factors must have zeros in the physical region .",
    "we confirm this interesting observation , although we disagree with some other results of this work ( see sec .",
    "[ iw2 ] ) .",
    "a similar model was considered in  @xcite . there , a single spin structure of the heavy - meson wave function was used , which is determined from the condition that the light quark be at rest in the meson rest frame .",
    "hence , all quark  antiquark wave functions have the same shape , and this shape was assumed to be @xmath71 , with @xmath35 being the constituent mass of the light quark . as we shall see later , for a realistic heavy meson the wave functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 do not coincide , and they are not well approximated by sharply peaked functions .",
    "integrals for the form factors receive important contributions from the region of low @xmath68 values , which are missing in the peaking approximation .",
    "therefore , the results obtained using such a static quark model can at best be taken as a crude estimate .",
    "perturbative qcd and the constituent quark model were recently applied also to the semileptonic decays @xmath74  @xcite , for which @xmath75 . in our opinion , such small values of @xmath76 are far too low to treat the gluon with @xmath77 perturbatively .",
    "moreover , the calculations in  @xcite are done using a model wave function with an ad hoc @xmath78 dependence , whose longitudinal - momentum dependence contradicts the expectations based on the hqet .",
