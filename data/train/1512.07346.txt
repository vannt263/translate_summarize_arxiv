    "we obtain a transmission coefficient that shows oscillatory behavior , where we can observe the resonance tunneling .",
    "additionally , we obtain the energy spectrum of bound states by a simple and transparent way .",
    "we show that the eigenenergies obtained have great similarity to the problem of fermions in the same potential , already explored in the literature @xcite .",
    "the dkp equation for a free boson is given by @xcite ( in natural units , @xmath0)@xmath1where the matrices @xmath2  satisfy the algebra @xmath3 and the metric tensor is @xmath4diag@xmath5 .",

    "the projection operator can be written as @xcite @xmath26 . in this case",
    "@xmath12 picks out the first component of the dkp spinor .",
    "the five - component spinor can be written as @xmath27 in such a way that the time - independent dkp equation for a boson constrained moves along the @xmath28-axis , restricting ourselves to potentials depending only on @xmath29 , decomposes into @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32and the conserved currents have the form@xmath33      using the representation of @xmath2  matrices for vector bosons , given by @xcite :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 are the 3@xmath253 spin-1 matrices , @xmath36 are the 1@xmath253 matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while @xmath39 and @xmath24 designate the 3@xmath253 unit and zero matrices , respectively , the time - independent dkp equation ( see ref .",

    "now the components of the four - current are@xmath48    we can see , from ( @xmath49 ) and ( @xmath50 ) , that the solution for vector sector consists in searching solutions for two klein - gordon - like equations for @xmath51 , but @xmath52and @xmath53 are not independents because @xmath18 is the constraint that appears in both equations .",
    "cardoso and collaborators jpa had already alerted that the solutions for the spin 1 sector of the dkp equation , if they really exist , can be obtained from a restrict class of solutions of the spin 0 sector .",
    "there is not surprise because in the absence of any interaction , the free proca fields obey a free klein - gordon equation with a constraint on the components of the proca field .",

    "this is well understood because both have the same effective schrdinger equations for spinor components in square potentials .",
    "however , there is no total reflection for fermions .",
    "additionally , we can obtain the bound state solutions with the prescription @xmath90 in the transmission amplitude . in this clear way",
    ", the bound state spectrum is obtained from poles of @xmath91 , and the wave functions have the same form as ( 13 ) with @xmath92 . as expected , there are bound state solutions just for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , because the effective equation show a attractive potential between the two delta function potentials .",
    "it is like fermions bind by the same effective potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , for @xmath95 , @xmath96is the quantization condition for the problem of bound scalar bosons by an effective well potential with attractive and repulsive deltas at the borders .",
    "the condition ( 27 ) can be solved by the graphical method and the numerical solutions are show in the figure 2 .",
    "the nonminimal vector coupling is impossible in klein - gordon equation and we can observe this fact in the bound states spectrum . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors solve the minimally coupling klein - gordon equation with the same square potential , but the spectrum is completely different from the one obtained in this work .",
    "this reveals the great applicability of dkp formalism for describing physical systems with many coupling possibilities .",
    "the presence of delta functions at the borders has impact under the parity of the solutions , i.e , there is a symmetry breaking due to the delta potentials .",
    "the effective potential has no defined parity which implies in solutions without defined parity .",
    "from the figure 2 we can see that the energy levels decay more rapidilly with the @xmath97 increasing .",
    "this can be explained by the limit @xmath98 , which provides that there are more bound states with the increase of depth well .",
    "however , in the limite case    @xmath99    we obtain just an atractive delta potential at the origin @xmath100 which provides only one bound level @xcite . in figure 3",
    ", we have the behaviour of @xmath18 in function of the lenght @xmath101 for @xmath102 ( strong potential ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath103 we can see the expected only one bound state level .    from figures 2 and 3 we can conclude that there is no klein s paradox for this configuration , i.e , particle levels penetrating in the antiparticle _ continuum _ region with the increasing of @xmath104 and @xmath101 .",
    "an interesting relativistic phenomena observed from bound state spectrum is the schiff - snyder - weinberg ( ssw ) effect @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs when an attractive well for particles in a critical depth lodges bound states of particles and antiparticles in the klein - gordon equation .",
    "popov @xcite suggests that the effect is characteristic of short - range and depth potentials .",
    "our nonminimal vector potential , in the limits given by ( 28 ) , contain all the characteristics to exhibit the ssw effect in the dkp formalism . from figures 2 and 3",
    ", we can see this phenomena because the spectrum is symmetrical with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "we know that the minimally coupled case , the dkp equation reveals the ssw effect only with intense vector potential .",
    "however , in the nonminimal vector case , the ssw effect occurs independent of intensity potential .",
    "the explanation for this difference that makes our results be expected is that the dkp equation , in the presence of nonminimal vector interactions , is invariant under charge conjugation .",
    "therefore , the square potential lodges bound states of particles and antiparticles , independent of intensity potential , as seen in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "vector bosons are subject to the effective potential    @xmath105    which there is @xmath106dependence . however , for our problem , we can see that the polarization is only relate to the localization of delta functions at the borders of the square potential , i.e , if the delta potentials are attractive or repulsive .",
    "the results for scalar bosons does not depend on the position of delta functions .",
    "therefore , the same results ( @xmath107 , @xmath81 and bound states spectrum ) of scalar bosons are obtained for vector bosons subjected to the same square potential , for both possibilities @xmath108 we must remember that these results were expected since solutions for spin @xmath109 bosons can be obtained from spin @xmath110 bosons as pointed in @xcite .",
    "the square potentials are simple models much explored in quantum physics books , for example @xcite . among various applications ,",
    "l. schiff schiff used a square well potential in the klein - gordon equation to bind the di - pions , providing a satisfactory account of the observed @xmath12-wave pion - pion scattering . in the ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used a square well potential as a model that allows calculating the phonon spectral function analytically in the nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) relaxation .",
    "the authors were able to estimate an absolute value for the expected peak position of the nmr relaxation rate near the experimental data .",
    "an application of barrier potentials can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors studied the tunneling spectroscopy of collective excitations .",
    "therefore , our results can be applied to all spinless bosons systems and the many couplings in the dkp formalism enable this .",
    "for @xmath111 . ]",
    "a physical system containing spinless bosons subject to the nonminimal vector square potentials is studied in the dkp formalism .",
    "the scattering states reveal an oscillatory transmission coefficient and the interesting particle problem embedded in a delta function is obtained .",
    "we can observe that there are bound state solutions only when the time component of square potential is more intense than its spatial component @xmath112 .",
    "the energy bound states were obtained in a simple way from the poles of transmission amplitude .",
    "the parity of bound solutions is broken , similar to the fermions problem in the same potential which was already discussed in the literature @xcite .",
