    "entanglement is the most characteristic trait of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "an entangled state of a system consisting of two subsystems can not be described as a product ( or a statistical mixtures of products ) of the quantum states of the two subsystems .",
    "in such a state , the system is inseparable and each component does not have properties independent of the other components .",
    "the nonlocal character of entangled states is at the basis of many paradoxes @xcite , and of the deep difference between the quantum and the classical world .",
    "the fundamental role of entanglement has been reemphasized in recent years after the discovery that it represents an unvaluable resource for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "in fact , entanglement is at the basis of secure quantum key distribution schemes @xcite , of quantum teleportation @xcite , and of the speed - up provided by some quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that entanglement can be found only in situations involving a small number of microscopic particles .",
    "for example , a given amount of entanglement is present between two different spins in the thermal equilibrium state of a system of many interacting spins ( the so - called thermal or natural entanglement @xcite ) .",
    "however , for quantum information processing , it is the deterministic generation and manipulation of entanglement which is of paramount importance , and in these last years a number of impressive experiments has demonstrated the controlled generation of entangled states of two @xcite , three @xcite and four @xcite particles . moreover , since entanglement is one of the distinguishing features of the quantum world , it is also fundamental to understand how far it can be extended into the macroscopic domain .",
    "this is important not only to better establish how the macroscopic classical world emerges from the microscopic one ruled by quantum mechanics @xcite , but also for application purposes .",
    "for example , entangled spin - squeezed states of atomic samples are known to improve the precision of frequency measurements @xcite , and the accuracy improves with increasing number of entangled atoms .",
    "a related question is to establish if and how two macroscopic degrees of freedom of two different objects can be entangled . with this respect ,",
    "a striking achievement has been recently shown in @xcite , where the entanglement between the spin states of two separated cs gas samples containing about @xmath0 atoms has been demonstrated . at the same time we proposed a feasible experiment @xcite in which even a more macroscopic entanglement between the oscillating modes of two mirrors with an effective mass of some milligrams can be generated by the radiation pressure of the light bouncing between them",
    "( see also @xcite for a different and extremely idealized model for the preparation of motion entangled states of two cavity mirrors ) .",
    "the continuous variable entanglement between two mechanical modes could be used to improve the detection of weak classical forces in optomechanical devices as atomic force microscopes or gravitational wave detectors @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze in more detail and further develop the proposal of @xcite .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite restricted to the case of identical cavity mirrors , i.e. , considered , for each mirror , a single oscillation mode with identical effective mass , optomechanical coupling , damping rate and , above all , identical resonance frequency .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the entanglement is present only within a small bandwidth around the mechanical resonance , and since in practice two mirrors are never exactly identical , it is important to establish the conditions under which entanglement can be generated between two mechanical modes with different resonance frequencies , and its dependence on the frequency mismatch .    in section",
    "ii we describe the optomechanical system under study in terms of quantum langevin equations . in section iii",
    "we solve the dynamics of the system in the frequency domain , and then we characterize in detail the entanglement between the two mirrors .",
    "section iv is for concluding remarks .",
    "we consider an optical ring cavity in which two perfectly reflecting mirrors can both oscillate under the effect of the radiation pressure force ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the motion of each mirror is the result of the excitation of many oscillation modes , either external @xcite or internal @xcite .",
    "the former is important for suspended mirrors since the excitation of pendulum modes of the suspension system leads to global displacements of the mirror .",
    "the latter corresponds to deformations of the mirror surface due to the excitation of internal acoustic modes of the substrate .",
    "these various degrees of freedom have however different resonance frequencies and one can select the mechanical response of a single particular mode by using a bandpass filter in the detection circuit @xcite . for this reason we shall consider a single mechanical mode for each mirror , which will be therefore described as a simple harmonic oscillator . since we shall consider two mirrors with similar design , the two modes will be characterized by different , but quite close , values for the frequencies , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and for the effective masses , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    the optomechanical coupling between the mirrors and the cavity field is realized by the radiation pressure .",
    "the electromagnetic field exerts a force on a movable mirror which is proportional to the intensity of the field , which , at the same time , is phase - shifted by a quantity proportional to the the mirror displacement from the equilibrium position . in the adiabatic limit",
    "in which the mirror frequency is much smaller than the cavity free spectral range @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the diagonal of the square optical path in the cavity , see fig .  1 ) , one can focus on one cavity mode only ( with annihilation operator @xmath7 and frequency @xmath8 ) , because photon scattering into other modes can be neglected @xcite .",
    "one gets the following hamiltonian @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the dimensionless position and momentum operators of the mirrors with @xmath12=i\\delta_{ij}$ ] , @xmath13 @xmath14 are the optomechanical coupling constants , and the last terms in eq .",
    "[ h ] describe the laser driving the cavity mode , characterized by a frequency @xmath15 and a power @xmath16 ( @xmath17 is the cavity mode linewidth ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the problem , however , must include photon losses , and the thermal noise on the mirrors .",
    "it means that the interaction of the optical mode with its reservoir and the effect of thermal fluctuations on the two mirrors , not considered in hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , must be added .",
    "this can be accomplished in the standard way @xcite .",
    "we neglect instead all the technical sources of noise , i.e. , we shall assume that the driving laser is stabilized in intensity and frequency , also because recent experiments have shown that classical laser noise can be made negligible in the relevant frequency range @xcite .",
    "the full quantum dynamics of the system can be exactly described by the following nonlinear langevin equations ( in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath18 ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) are the mechanical damping rates of the mechanical modes , @xmath22 represent the vacuum white noise operator at the cavity input @xcite , and the langevin noise operators for the quantum brownian motion of the mirrors are @xmath23 .",
    "the non - vanishing noise correlations are @xmath24- i\\sin\\left[\\omega(t - t')\\right ] \\right ]   \\,,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath26 the equilibrium temperature ( the two mirrors are considered in equilibrium with their respective bath at the same temperature ) .",
    "notice that the used approach for the brownian motion is quantum mechanical consistent at every temperature @xcite .",
    "we consider the situation when the driving field is very intense . under this condition ,",
    "the system is characterized by a semiclassical steady state with the internal cavity mode in a coherent state @xmath27 , and a displaced equilibrium position for the mirrors .",
    "the steady state values are obtained by taking the expectation values of eqs .",
    "( [ nonlineqs ] ) , factorizing them and setting all the time derivatives to zero .",
    "one gets @xmath28 where @xmath29 , is the cavity mode detuning .    under these semiclassical conditions , the dynamics",
    "is well described by linearizing eqs .",
    "( [ nonlineqs ] ) around the steady state .",
    "if we now use the same symbols for the operators describing the quantum fluctuations around the steady state , we get the following linearized quantum langevin equations @xmath30",
    "the time evolution of the system can be easily obtained by solving the linear quantum langevin equations ( [ lineqs ] ) . however , as it happens in quantum optics for squeezing ( see for example @xcite ) , it is more convenient to study the system dynamics in the frequency domain .",
    "in fact , it is possible that , due to the effect of damping , and thermal and quantum noise , the two mechanical modes of the mirrors are never entangled in time , i.e. , there is no time instant in which the reduced state of the two mechanical modes is entangled , unless appropriate ( but difficult to prepare ) initial conditions of the whole system are considered .",
    "entanglement can be instead always present at a given frequency .",
    "in fact , the two mirrors constitute , for each frequency , a continuous variable bipartite system which , in a given frequency bandwidth , can be in an entangled state .",
    "the fourier analysis refers to the quantum fluctuations around the semiclassical steady state discussed in the preceding section , and the eventual entanglement found at a given frequency would refer to a stationary state of the corresponding spectral modes , maintained by the radiation mode , and which decays only when the radiation is turned off .",
    "the spectral analysis is more convenient also because in such systems the dynamics is experimentally better studied in frequency rather than in time .",
    "the same kind of spectral analysis of the nonlocal properties of a bipartite continuous variable system has been already applied in ref .",
    "@xcite which demonstrated the epr nonlocality between two optical beams of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier , following the suggestion of @xcite .    performing the fourier transform of eqs .",

    "notice that @xmath35 and @xmath36 , but @xmath37 .",
    "the simplest way to establish the parameter region where the oscillation modes of the two cavity mirrors are entangled is to use one of the sufficient criteria for entanglement of continuous variable systems already existing in the literature .",
    "these criteria are inequalities which have to be satisfied by the product @xcite or the sum @xcite of variances of appropriate linear combinations of the rescaled position and momentum operators of the continuous variable systems .",

    "the frequency bandwidth of the entanglement region rapidly decreases with increasing temperature , so that , with the chosen parameter values , entanglement disappears above @xmath78 k. as expected , the @xmath76 region where the two mirrors are entangled becomes smaller for increasing frequency mismatch ( compare the three figures ) .",
    "nonetheless these results are extremely interesting because they clearly show the possibility to entangle two _ macroscopic oscillators _",
    "( with an effective mass of @xmath79 mg ) in a stationary way , using present technology .",
    "in fact , the two modes are still clearly entangled at @xmath80 k and with @xmath74 hz ( ten times larger than the width of the mechanical resonance peaks , see fig .",
    "3 ) , while one is forced to go below @xmath80 k when the frequency mismatch is equal to @xmath81 hz ( see fig .  4 ) .    differently from temperature and frequency mismatch , and as it can be seen from the involved analytical expression above , it is difficult to determine how the degree of entanglement depends upon the other parameters .",
    "it can only be verified that , as expected , entanglement improves with increasing mechanical quality factor @xmath82 and that it strongly improves with increasing the effective optomechanical coupling constant , which is given by @xmath83 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ lineqs ] ) ) .",
    "this shows that for achieving even a more macroscopic entanglement ( i.e. , larger masses ) , one has to use smaller cavities and , above all , larger optical power .",
    "the fundamental importance of the effective coupling constant @xmath83 also helps us to show which kind of entangled state of the two mirrors is generated by the radiation pressure .",
    "in fact , when the cavity mode intensity becomes larger and larger , the optomechanical interaction tends to project the two mechanical modes onto an approximate eigenstate of @xmath84 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ h ] ) and ( [ lineqs ] ) ) , which , since in our case it is @xmath85 , is essentially equivalent to the relative distance @xmath39 .",
    "the two oscillators occupy a state that , like a standard epr state , has a very small variance of the relative distance @xmath86 . on the other hand ,",
    "since the radiation pressure does not have analogous effects on the total momentum @xmath87 , the state of the mirrors does not exhibit such a small value for the variance @xmath88 as the standard epr state does . nonetheless , at large optical intensities , as shown by the product criterion of eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , the effect of the radiation pressure force on the relative distance is sufficient to entangle the two macroscopic oscillator modes .",
    "moreover , as it can be seen from figs .  2 - 4 , the degree of entanglement @xmath56 lies even below @xmath89 at sufficiently low temperatures , allowing therefore in principle also an experimental test of epr nonlocality with macroscopic oscillators , on the basis of the inequality ( [ infer ] ) of refs .",
    "we have shown how the optomechanical coupling realized by the radiation pressure of an optical mode of a ring cavity is able to entangle two macroscopic collective oscillation modes of two cavity mirrors .",
    "using parameter values corresponding to already performed experiments involving an optical cavity mode coupled to an acoustic mode of the mirror ( with an effective mass of many milligrams ) we have shown that an appreciable entanglement is achievable at temperatures of some kelvin .",
    "this continuous variable entanglement is established at a given frequency , between the spectrally decomposed oscillation modes of the two mirrors ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite for an analogous spectral analysis of the nonlocal properties of the beams of a nondegenerate optical amplifier ) .",
    "one has a stationary entanglement , which is maintained by the strongly driven cavity mode as long as it is turned on . using the degree of entanglement @xmath56 of eq .",
    "( [ degree ] ) , suggested by the inseparability condition of eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , we have seen that the entanglement is more robust when the two mechanical resonance frequencies are equal ( fig .",
    "2 ) , but that it tolerates a resonance frequency mismatch of tens of hz , much larger than the width of the resonance peaks .",
    "the best entanglement is always achieved in the middle of the two mechanical resonances and the frequency bandwidth of the entanglement parameter region rapidly decreases with decreasing optomechanical coupling and increasing temperatures .",
    "this continuous variable entanglement between two macroscopic collective degrees of freedom can be experimentally measured using for example the three - cavity scheme described in detail in @xcite .",
    "in such a scheme , a ring cavity is supplemented with two other external cavities , each measuring the spectral components @xmath46 and @xmath47 of each mirror oscillation mode via homodyne detection . with these measurements , it is possible to obtain both variances @xmath90 and @xmath91 . as it has been verified in @xcite ,",
    "if the driving power of the meter cavities is much smaller than the driving power of the `` entangler '' cavity mode , the two additional cavities do not significantly modify the entanglement dynamics . a simplified detection scheme , involving less than three cavities is currently investigated .",
    "in fact , the homodyne detection of the entangler mode @xmath7 provides direct information on the relative distance between the mirror modes @xmath39 .",
    "the measurement of the total momentum quadrature @xmath40 could be then achieved using the result of this homodyne detection and that of the homodyne measurement of the motion of a single mirror provided by a second `` meter '' cavity mode .",
    "it is however possible that an even simpler detection scheme exists , using the entangler cavity mode only .",
    "another important aspect which has to be taken into account is that the motion of each mirror is the superposition of many oscillation modes with different resonance frequencies .",
    "we can safely verify the entanglement between the two considered oscillation modes provided that the other modes of the two mirrors are sufficiently far away in frequency so that their contribution at the analysed frequencies is negligible .",
    "moreover , the above analysis also applies , almost unmodified , to the case when the two modes belong to the same mirror .",
    "the possibility to prepare entangled state of two macroscopic degrees of freedom is not only conceptually important for better understanding the relation between the macroscopic world ruled by classical mechanics and the quantum mechanical microscopic substrate , but it may also prove to be useful for some applications .",
