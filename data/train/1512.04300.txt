    "kesteven 79 ( or g33.6 + 0.1 , hereafter kes 79 ) is a galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) first discovered by caswell et al .",
    "( 1975 ) from analysis of radio sky surveys .",
    "kes 79 is classified as a possible mixed - morphology snr ( rho and petre 1998 ) . in the radio continuum ,",
    "very large array ( vla ) observations have revealed a peculiar double - shell morphology of the snr with two incomplete concentric rings of apparently different radii ( velusamy et al .",
    "1991 ) whose origin is still under debate .",
    "the detections of a 1667  mhz oh absorption feature along the line - of - sight with @xmath2 to @xmath3  km s@xmath4 ( green 1989 ) and spatially coincident with a nearby molecular cloud ( mc ) : the co and hco@xmath5 emission at velocities in the same range ( e.g. , scoville et al .",
    "1987 , green and dewdney 1992 ) , suggest that the snr shockwave is interacting with the dense molecular clouds .",
    "the distance to the snr has been estimated to be around 6.5 to 7.5  kpc through h absorption ( case and bhattacharya 1998 ) and 7.5  kpc by h velocity measurements ( giacani et al .",
    "the apparent angular size thus implies a diameter of about 20  pc .",
    "kes 79 is also known to be a gev gamma - ray emitter from recent observations by the fermi large area telescope ( lat ) ( auchettl et al .",
    "2014 ) . considering",
    "the observed spectral shape and brightness of the gev emission , the snr is interacting with mcs ; the gamma - rays are most naturally interpreted as having a ` hadronic ' origin ; locally accelerated cosmic - ray ( cr ) protons collide with the surrounding dense clouds and produce neutral pions which subsequently decay into gamma - ray pairs .",
    "tsunemi and enoguchi ( 2002 ) reported that the x - ray spectrum of kes 79 has a thermal origin and can be described by a non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma with nearly uniform temperature and abundances ( sub - solar ) .",
    "seward et al . ( 2003 ) discovered a central compact object ( cco ) using chandra , and suggested that the snr originated from a core - collapse sn ( cc - snr ) .",
    "this snr shows filamentary structures and faint emission near the southwest ( sw ) of the outer radio shell ( sun et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "x - ray spectra with better statistics were obtained by xmm - newton observations ( giacani et al .",
    "2009 ) . the global spectrum can be fitted with a single nei plasma , where the abundances are near solar , except for ar which shows an unusually large abundance of 5.0@xmath6 solar . however , all the previous observations lack sufficient photon statistics to separate the ejecta from the circumstellar components of the x - ray emission , which obviously makes it difficult to extract the mass and nature of the progenitor star .    recently ,",
    "auchettl et al . (",
    "2014 ) compiled the accumulated data from xmm - newton observations of kes 79 and performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis .",
    "they found that x - ray spectra from about half of the region require two plasma components : a 0.24  kev pshock model with solar abundances , and a @xmath10.8  kev vpshock with super solar abundances .",
    "they inferred that the former is emitted by the shocked ambient material ( ism ) , while the latter is due to shocked ejecta . although the spectral parameters of the vpshock plasma component ( i.e. , temperatures , abundances and ionization parameters ) are found to be roughly homogeneous in space , they claimed there is a hint of higher chemical abundances near the snr center .",
    "these previous spectral studies were performed for energies below 34  kev mainly due to the high background in higher energy bands . in this paper , we report a new x - ray study of kes 79 using _ suzaku _ data in the 0.77.5  kev band , taking advantages of the low and stable in - orbit background and the high sensitivity in the hard x - ray band of the xis instrument ( mistuda et al .",
    "2007 , koyama  2007 ) .",
    "we construct a model for the galactic x - ray background emission to maximize the source photon statistics .",
    "fitting of the resulting source spectrum clearly requires a multi - temperature nei plasma and additional cie plasma component .",
    "we found non - solar abundances in the nei component with newly discovered k - shell lines of al , ar and ca .",
    "the cie plasma is close to solar abundance and is spatially extended toward the outer radio ring . a clear fe k - line near 6.4  kev from this cc - snr is also detected for the first time .",
    "we present our interpretations for the origin and structure of kes79 , particularly on the fe - line emission .",
    "all errors in this report are 90% confidence levels , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the data are obtained from the _ suzaku _ key project observations for the systematic x - ray study of mixed - morphology snrs ( pi = koyama , k. ) .",
    "we also use _ suzaku _ archival data near kes 78 , a snr adjacent to kes 79 , to estimate the local x - ray background .",
    "the observation log is summarized in table  1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath7@xmath8 , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the electron and proton number densities ( @xmath13 ) , the distance to the snr ( cm ) and emission volume ( @xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "+ [ tbl : par background ]",
    "we have shown that the x - ray spectrum of kes 79 is best described by two components : a cie plasma and a multi - temperature nei plasma . since the cie plasma has solar abundance , while the nei counterpart is non - solar , the former is most naturally interpreted as interstellar medium ( ism ) shocked by the snr blast wave .",
    "the larger extension of the cie plasma toward the outer radio shell also supports that the cie plasma is blast wave shocked ism plasma .",
    "the latter ( nei ) would be then an ejecta heated up by the reverse shock .",
    "figure  10 shows the comparison of the overall ejecta abundance pattern of kes 79 with available explosive nucleosynthesis models of type ia ( cdd1 : iwamoto et al .",
    "1999 ) and cc supernovae ( cc - sn ) ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "the measured abundance pattern broadly agrees with the @xmath13040  cc - sn models . assuming that the ejecta of kes 79 has a roughly spherical shape with a 5  arcmin radius and distance ( @xmath11 ) of 7  kpc , the x - ray emitting volume ( @xmath12 ) is @xmath15  @xmath14 , where @xmath16 is the filling factor . from the normalization of the nei emission component ( @xmath17  @xmath18 ) ,",
    "the total ejecta mass is estimated to be @xmath19 .",
    "this mass estimation is based on a h - dominated plasma . using he ,",
    "c and o abundances from ejecta models of @xmath13040  progenitor stars , the total ejecta mass is re - estimated to be @xmath20 .",
    "these are reasonably consistent with a @xmath13040  progenitor star , taking account of the distance ambiguity .",
    "the nei ( ejecta ) plasma has a temperature structure such that lighter elements are colder than the heavier elements .",
    "this trend is found in young ia snrs with onion - like structure , where the heavier elements are concentrated in the inner regions , while lighter elements are in the outer layers . as is shown in section 3.4 ,",
    "kes 79 has no onion - like structure ; heavier elements are rather depleted in the central core .",
    "therefore the observed temperature structure of this cc - snr may be indicative of some mechanism other than that of onion - like type ia structure origin .",
    "one possibility is that the heavier elements attained higher ion temperature just after shock heating .",
    "if the time scale of energy transfer from ion to electron is comparable or longer than the ejecta plasma age , the electrons around the heavier elements can be at higher temperature than those around the lighter elements . to justify this idea , we need detail simulations of shock heating and preceding energy transfer process from ions to electrons , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our work reveals that x - rays are extended to the outer ring of @xmath21@xmath22 to beyond what was previously known .",
    "the x - ray radial profile indicates the outer x - rays are associated with the outer radio shell . in the outer ring ,",
    "the surface brightness of the cie ( ism ) relative to nei ( ejecta ) is larger than that of the inner ring and center core . assuming the emitting volume of cie to be a sphere , the inner and outer regions have a similar density @xmath23  @xmath24 according to projection effect .",
    "the temperature of the cie is also the same as that in the main x - ray emitting regions .",
    "thus the ism plasma is uniformly distributed in the whole snr in terms of density and temperature .    for the angular size of @xmath25  arcmin",
    ", the radius of the outer ring is 16  pc , and the volume of the plasma is @xmath26  @xmath14 .",
    "the best - fit ism temperature of @xmath27  kev gives the expansion speed of @xmath28  cm  s@xmath4 from the strong shock relation assuming electron - ion temperature equilibration , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the mean atomic mass and the mass of a hydrogen atom , respectively .",
    "taking into account the velocity decrease in time ( @xmath32 ) of @xmath33 , the dynamical age is estimated to be @xmath34  years from the sedov self - similar solution ( sedov 1959 ) .",
    "thus kes79 is an old - intermediate aged snr .",
    "we discovered a k - shell line of fe at 6.4  kev .",
    "since model a gives a good fit , the inferred origin of the 6.4  kev line would be a low ionization fe in the ejecta .",
    "for the progenitor type inferred from the abundance pattern , the expected fe mass is around @xmath35  .",
    "this mass is not inconsistent with current cc - sn models ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "however the detection of fe lines at @xmath36  kev is very unusual for cc - snrs ( see , e.g. , yamaguchi et al .",
    "the spatial distribution of the 6.4  kev line , no emission near the core region and enhanced emission toward the boundary of the snr , is against the idea of the ejecta origin .    a dense molecular cloud near kes 79 has been found using @xmath37co data recently ( see figure 5 of giacani et al 2009 ) .",
    "the @xmath38 difference between kes 79 and the nearby background ( bg2 ) is @xmath39  @xmath40 ( table 2 ) .",
    "thus , we can assume that the molecular could with @xmath41  @xmath40 is just behind kes 79 .",
    "the empirical relation between the mass and size ( scovile et al.1987 ) gives a mean density of h of @xmath42  pc)@xmath43 , which is @xmath44  @xmath40 for this cloud .",
    "these values are roughly consistent with our estimations from the bg2 and kes79 spectra .",
    "thus , another possible origin of the 6.4  kev line is due to neutral fe , an inner - shell ionization of the molecular cloud by the locally accelerated cosmic rays ( crs ) . since the equivalent width ( ew ) of the line is larger than 2  kev , cr electrons can be excluded ( e.g. valinia et al .",
    "2000 ) , cr protons are the more probable candidate responsible for the 6.4  kev line production ( dogiel et al .",
    "the flux of the 6.4 kev line is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath38 are the cross section to produce the 6.4 kev line by particles , the velocity and density of the protons , and the line - of - sight hydrogen column density , respectively .",
    "the 6.4 kev flux is @xmath49  @xmath40  s@xmath4 .",
    "the cross section @xmath50 has a peak of @xmath51  @xmath52  hydrogen - atom@xmath4 at 10  mev in solar abundance ( romo - krger 1998 ) .",
    "we then calculate the proton energy density to be @xmath53  ev  cc@xmath4 by simply using a mono - energetic distribution .",
    "this is about 100 times larger than the canonical value @xmath54  ev  cc@xmath4 in the ism , and hence implies a production site near the snr whose forward shock is accelerating the protons responsible for the ionization .",
    "a similar connection between the 6.4 kev line and @xmath55  mev protons has observationally confirmed by nobukawa et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "the cr protons also produce the majority of the observed gamma - rays through the @xmath56-decay mechanism ( e.g. , auchettl  ( 2014 ) , lee  ( 2015 ) ) .",
    "although we can not unveil the spatial distribution of this line emission beyond the angular resolution of _ suzaku _ , the detection of the 6.4  kev line has strong implications on the local environment , and possibly for the gev gamma - ray emission .",
    "we note that the effect of cr energy losses is non - negligible in the mev energy range in a dense molecular environment . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath56-decay gamma - rays are produced by protons of energies above the pion production threshold and thus are not much affected by coulomb losses .",
    "therefore , the larger energy content inferred from the gev emission ( auchettl  2014 ) than from the 6.4  kev line ( this work ) is not surprising .",
    "since the diffusion length of @xmath55  mev protons is @xmath54  pc , the shock front of the blast wave ( site of the @xmath55  mev proton production ) should be in contact with the molecular clouds ( site of the 6.4  kev line production ) .",
    "this situation is different from the larger diffusion length of gev proton and resulting gev gamma - ray emission , and hence may also relax the apparent energy deficiency of the mev protons compared to the gev protons ; the gev gamma - ray region would have an extension larger than that of the 6.4  kev line region .",
    "we have carefully studied the galactic snr kes 79 using _ suzaku _ data and a reliable background model of grxe near the snr",
    ". a 6.4  kev k@xmath57 line from nearly neutral fe is discovered , and is found to associate spatially with dense molecular clouds interacting with kes 79 .",
    "a number of other interesting new results have also been obtained and are summarized below :    * the x - ray spectrum of kes 79 is well described by a multi - temperature nei plasma plus a low - temperature cie plasma , in addition to a @xmath16.4  kev k@xmath57 line from fe  . * the abundance pattern and mass of the nei plasma",
    "indicate that the snr originates from the core - collapse of a @xmath13040  progenitor .",
    "* the cie plasma has solar abundances and is spatially extended beyond the super - solar nei plasma , to the outer radio ring .",
    "the cie plasma is hence most probably ambient gas run over and heated by the forward shock .",
    "* the @xmath16.4  kev line feature can be produced either from the unshocked ejecta or a mc interacting with low - energy cr protons accelerated locally by the snr shock .",
    "however , its spatial association with a mc points to the latter possibility .",
    "the authors express sincere thanks to all the _ suzaku _ team members .",
