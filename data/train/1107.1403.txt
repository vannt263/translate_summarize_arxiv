    "we assume familiarity with basic matroid concepts such as contraction matroids , dual matroids , or the flat lattice @xcite .",
    "a famous binary matroid is the _ fano _ matroid @xmath3 on the set @xmath4 which can be defined as the column matroid of this @xmath5 matrix over @xmath6 :    @xmath7    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     specifically mod is given as a disjoint union @xmath8 where each row @xmath9 consists of certain @xmath10-vectors @xmath11 of length 8 , corresponding to subsets of @xmath12 in the usual way .",
    "the string of symbols ( say ) @xmath13 in @xmath14 by definition means that only vectors @xmath11 are allowed that have _ at least one _ @xmath15 in a position occupied by an @xmath16 .",
    "similarly for @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus @xmath14 contains @xmath19 vectors @xmath11 , one of them say @xmath20 .",
    "there is a systematic ( recursive ) procedure to determine the number of sets of fixed cardinality in such a _ multivalued _ row .",
    "but here we proceed ad hoc .",
    "namely , the sought bases of being the maximal independent sets , each base occurs as a maximal member of some row @xmath9 . here , incidentally , each row - maximal member also is a base ( since it has cardinality 5 ) .",
    "the row - maximal members of @xmath9 are obtained by filling each @xmath21-bubble to full capacity with @xmath22 s in all possible ways .",
    "for instance , @xmath23 in @xmath24 can be filled with four @xmath22 s in 5 ways .",
    "it follows that @xmath24 features @xmath25 bases .",
    "altogether there are @xmath26 bases @xmath27 .",
    "it is plausible that for each base @xmath27 the parameters @xmath28 required in ( 2 ) can now be calculated fast .",
    "the numbers @xmath29 can be obtained the same way ; after all they are just the numbers @xmath30 for the dual bases @xmath31 .",
    "we mention that the bottleneck in the sketched method is getting the circuits and cocircuits ( the bases and cobases are then readily found as sketched ) .",
    "how the circuits can be retrieved faster than by browsing the whole cycle space , and how the cocircuits arise _ from _ the circuits ( even the chordless ones ) , is work in progress .",
    "complete lists with tables of numbers of non - isomorphic regular matroids can be found on the web :        as it was previously explained , first we determine lists of non - isomorphic binary matroids . for @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "there are complete lists of the representatives of the isomorphism classes of all ( a ) loopless , ( b ) simple loopless , ( c ) connected simple loopless , and ( d ) connected loopless binary matroids of rank @xmath34 and size @xmath21 . as the standard representative of a matroid we choose the lexicographic smallest representative in its isomorphism class .    by testing these matroids for regularity ,",
    "we obtain complete lists of standard representatives of the isomorphism classes of ( a ) connected simple loopless and ( b ) connected loopless regular matroids of rank @xmath34 and size @xmath21 again for @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the lists of matroids of rank @xmath35 were computed by changing from a matroid to its dual . if @xmath36 is a binary matroid of size @xmath21 and rank @xmath34 , then its dual",
    ", @xmath37 is a binary matroid of size @xmath21 and rank @xmath38 .",
    "two binary matroids are isomorphic if and only if their duals are isomorphic .",
    "moreover , a matroid is regular if and only if its dual is regular . using this method we determined complete lists of ( in general non - standard ) representatives of the isomorphism classes of ( a ) connected simple loopless and ( b ) connected loopless regular matroids of rank @xmath39 and size @xmath40 .                      .",
