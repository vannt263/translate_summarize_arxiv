    "in the last years much effort was put , on both experimental and theoretical sides , into understanding the spin structure of the proton ( for reviews of the emc spin crisis , see @xcite ) .",
    "new data for the polarized deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) structure function @xmath0 from slac @xcite and the smc @xcite are consistent with the previous emc @xcite result .",
    "two different scenarios can explain the data , large anomalous sea - quark or large anomalous gluon interpretation @xcite , which are connected with the problem of the anomalous gluon contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , a renormalization group transformation can shift the anomalous contribution to the quark sector or to the gluon sector . in this way , either the anomaly manifested in the matrix element of the axial quark current is responsible for the large polarization of the sea or it can be perturbatively taken into account in the gluon coefficient function , while the quark matrix element is anomaly - free .",
    "the dependence of this renormalization group transformation on the gluon momentum fraction @xmath1 is still controversial .    from the physical point of view , it is more natural that the anomaly is attributed to the gluons .",
    "the gluonic coefficient function then absorbs only the short - distance contributions , while the quark distribution corresponds to a conserved operator and may be invoked in the low - energy description of the proton .",
    "the corresponding picture of the nucleon spin structure is most popular and the gluon polarization is considered to be its most important unknown ingredient .",
    "the problem of its @xmath1-dependence is the `` physical '' counterpart of the above - mentioned renormalization group transformation .    the accounting for the anomaly by the finite renormalization transformation is effectively resulting in the substitution in the partonic expression for the structure function @xmath0 , @xmath2 for the first moment of the spin - dependent quark distribution for each flavour .",
    "the oversimplified  naive \" @xmath1-dependent analogue is just @xmath3 however , such an expression is not compatible , in principle , with the fact that the gluon contribution starts at one - loop level only .",
    "the simplest , consistent approach was explored in ref .",
    "@xcite a few years ago , by taking the infrared ( ir ) finite part @xmath4 of the box diagram , responsible for the photon ",
    "gluon interaction : @xmath5    however , the choice of the finite part is ambiguous and the specific role of the axial anomaly remains unclear .",
    "this is why the attempt followed in ref .",
    "@xcite to perform the decomposition of the box diagram , referring to its kinematical structure .",
    "the anomaly then contributes to the singlet structure , associated with the spin structure function @xmath6 of the photon - gluon scattering as well . ] : @xmath7    attributing the anomalous gluon contribution to this structure function resulted in its @xmath8-dependence .",
    "later , this expression was obtained and exploited in different approaches @xcite . however",
    ", both derivations and interpretations of this result do not seem complete and some more solid ground is desirable .",
    "the anomalous gluon contribution plays an exceptional role in the general classification of perturbative qcd contributions .",
    "formally , it is a part of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) contribution .",
    "however , due to the well - known growth of the first moment of the spin - dependent gluon distribution , compensating one power of @xmath9 makes it essential also at leading order . the recently calculated two - loop , spin - dependent anomalous dimensions @xcite make it now possible to perform the complete nlo analysis of the experimental data @xcite .",
    "these nlo calculations were performed in the dimensional regularization using the t hooft  veltman  breitenlohner  maison ( hvbm ) scheme @xcite in which @xmath10 does not anticommute in the unphysical space - time dimensions . in this minimal subtraction ( ms )",
    "scheme both chiral invariance in the non - singlet sector and the one - loop character of the singlet axial anomaly are explicitly broken and their restoration requires an additional finite renormalization .",
    "as the hvbm scheme is used , a further renormalization group transformation is performed @xcite in order to make the result compatible with the standard factorization prescription and the low - energy intuitive description of the proton .",
    "however , only the value of the first moment was fixed in that procedure , so that there remains an ambiguity in this transformation .",
    "note that the function @xmath8 was also proposed for this purpose @xcite .    in the present article",
    ", we are suggesting the non - local generalization of the axial anomaly based on the canonical ward identities for light - ray operators .",
    "this allows us to give the natural description of both anomaly - free singlet quark distribution and anomalous gluon contribution , which fix the @xmath1-dependence of the renormalization group transformation .",
    "the final result is a rigorous proof of the @xmath8-behaviour of the anomalous contribution in nlo . here",
    ", we do not address the issue of higher loop corrections to the generalized axial anomaly .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii discusses the chiral invariance breaking of flavour non - singlet light - ray operators due to the renormalization , and their restoration by a finite renormalization",
    ". then we derive ward identities for light - ray operators and compute the non - local singlet axial anomaly , which can be expressed as a divergence from a generalized topological current . in section",
    "iii we use our results to define the anomaly - free singlet quark distribution and show the consequences for coefficient functions and evolution kernels in nlo approximation .",
    "as mentioned before , chiral invariance is broken in the hvbm scheme ; however , as it is known from the renormalization of the axial current , it can be restored by a finite renormalization , so that the non - singlet ward identity will be fulfilled .",
    "this finite renormalization constant @xmath11 can be computed for massless qcd from the requirement that the anticommutativity of @xmath10 is effectively restored @xcite , i.e. @xmath12\\psi \\bar{\\psi }      \\right\\rangle =      \\left\\langle          \\left[j^{a}_{\\mu}\\right]\\psi \\bar{\\psi }      \\right\\rangle   \\gamma^5 , \\quad \\mbox{with}\\quad z^{\\rm ns}=1-{\\alpha_s\\over\\pi } c_f + o(\\alpha_s^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13\\lambda^a\\psi$ ] with @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the axial vector and the vector current , respectively , @xmath16 is a flavour matrix , the symbol @xmath17 $ ] denotes minimal subtraction , and @xmath18 is the usual qcd colour factor .",
    "flavour and colour indices are suppressed for simplicity .",
    "the one - loop character of the singlet axial anomaly can also be ensured by some finite renormalization of the current .",
    "this required a two - loop calculation of the ward identities sandwiched between the two - gluon state .",
    "the @xmath9 correction to the corresponding @xmath19 factor , @xmath20 , coincides with the non - singlet factor @xmath21 . because of the appearance of so - called light - to - light subdiagrams , this coincidence is spoiled beyond the one - loop level .",
    "note that the one - loop approximation of @xmath22 can also be calculated by the requirement that the singlet ward identities are fulfilled for the two - quark state . since at",
    "leading order the axial anomaly does not appear in this ward identity , it follows that the finite renormalization factor is the same as that for the non - singlet channel .    the same problems as discussed above also occur for composite operators on the light - cone , which appear in the definition of spin - dependent quark distribution functions .",

    "the question is : how can we fix this finite renormalization constant ?",
    "after we have seen that the restoration of chiral invariance requires an @xmath1-dependent finite renormalization , a second question arises : does the axial anomaly also depend on @xmath1 ? to answer this question",
    "we use the equation of motion to derive ward identities for the divergence of the non - local operators ( [ defopxy ] ) .",

    "( [ wi2 ] ) then the use of the equation of motion will provide only contact terms",
    ". however , in the hvbm scheme the non - anticommutativity of @xmath10 gives an anomalous term , which should be cancelled by a finite renormalization ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , so that the anticommutativity of @xmath10 is effectively restored as discussed above .",
    "we calculated this anomalous term and after an appropriate definition of the appearing operators the finite renormalization constant ( [ resfinitenonlocal ] ) was extracted from the ward identity . as discussed above for the local case , because of the absence of the singlet axial anomaly in the ward identities for the green functions of quark fields at one - loop order , it follows that @xmath42 coincides with @xmath43 at this order .    for the singlet case ( @xmath44 )",

    "in addition to the finite multiplicative renormalization , as discussed in section ii . ] , it is also necessary to remove the axial anomaly from the definition of this function @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to define the singlet distribution function in terms of the anomaly - free operator ( [ anofreeop ] ) , which provides @xmath71 and the generalized topological current @xmath72 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ topocurrent ] ) .",
    "the problem that @xmath72 is gauge - variant , and thus that @xmath73 contains also unphysical components , can somehow be resolved by the choice of a physical gauge . in the light - cone gauge , the gauge - invariant twist-2 gluon operator @xmath74 can be expressed in the forward case by @xmath75 furthermore , from the definition of the gluon distribution function @xmath76 and from eqs .",
    "( [ defanomcont ] ) and ( [ conglonopandk ] ) , and after performing a partial integration , we find that @xmath73 is actually given in terms of the gauge - invariant gluon distribution function .",
    "thus , to remove the axial anomaly of the polarized quark distribution function it is sufficient to subtract a certain amount of the gluon distribution function : @xmath77 where the convolution is defined as @xmath78    indeed , removing the axial anomaly is equivalent to the following ( additive ) renormalization group transformation : @xmath79(x ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 are the coefficient functions , @xmath81 are the spin - dependent splitting kernels , and @xmath82 is the renormalization group coefficient of the running coupling constant .    because of gauge invariance the operator product analysis suggests that the zero moment of @xmath83 vanishes .",
    "after the transformation ( [ rengroptrans ] ) is performed , the gauge - variant axial anomaly contributes to the gluonic sector , so that the zero moment is now given by @xmath84 for completeness we give the difference of the splitting kernels in nlo : @xmath85 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta p_{qg}(x)- \\delta \\tilde{p}_{qg}(x )   & = &              \\left({\\alpha_s\\over 2\\pi}\\right)^2 n_f          \\big\\ {                  c_f\\left[(1-x)(1 - 4\\ln(1-x ) + 2\\ln x)\\right]+ \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hspace{20,5 mm }                  c_a\\left[(1-x)(-16 + 4\\ln(1-x ) ) -4(2+x)\\ln x\\right ]          \\big\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the casimir operator @xmath86 is equal to the number of colours .",

    "the evolution coincides with the one proposed by cheng @xcite .",

    "the contact with our derivation may be achieved by noting that the cancellation of normal and anomalous divergence , resulting in the effective conservation of axial current in the limit of infinite quark mass , is valid for the non - local anomaly as well .",
    "it is especially clear for the pauli - villars regularization , when the contribution of regulator fermions ( calculated in section ii ) is looking , up to the sign , precisely such us that of the quark masses , which is the starting point of the approach of cheng .    for practical purposes , irrespective of the used evolution scheme",
