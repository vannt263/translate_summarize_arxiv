    "design of chaotic electronic circuits offers a great challenge to the research community for the last three decades @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the motivation for designing a chaotic electronic circuit comes mainly from two facts : first , one can ` observe ' chaos , and can also control the dynamics of the circuit by simply changing the physically accessible parameters of the circuit , e.g. , resistor , capacitor , voltage levels , etc . ;",
    "second , there are multitude of applications of chaotic electronic oscillators starting from chaotic electronic communication to cryptography @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a chua s circuit is the first autonomous electronic circuit where a chaotic waveform was observed experimentally , established numerically , and proven theoretically @xcite-@xcite .",
    "moreover , it established that chaos is not a mathematical abstraction or numerical artifact , but is a very much realizable phenomenon .",
    "after the advent of chaotic chua s circuit , a large number of works have been reported on different methods of realization of this circuit .",
    "all of these realizations are mainly centered around following goals : inductor - free realization of chua s circuit , and realization of chua s diode .",
    "the reason behind the inductor - free realization lies in the fact that the presence of an inductor makes the circuit bulky , unsuitable for ic design , less robust , etc . in the inductor - free realization ,",
    "the inductor in chua s circuit is replaced by a general impedance converter ( gic ) that requires at least two op - amps .",
    "another approach to this end is wien - bridge based chua s circuit variant @xcite , where a wien - bridge oscillator is cascaded properly with the chua s diode . in this context ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite report a general algorithm for designing chua s circuit , in which it has been shown that a sinusoidal oscillator can be converted into chua s circuit by incorporating a proper type of nonlinearity .",
    "different realizations of chua s diode , which is the only locally active nonlinearity in the circuit , have been reported , e.g. , chua s diode using voa @xcite , @xcite , cfoa @xcite , ic realization of chua s diode @xcite , etc . also , four element chua s circuit has been reported in ref.@xcite , which is the minimum component chua s circuit till date .",
    "a detailed overview on the chua s circuit implementation can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , an inductor - free realization of the chua s circuit based on electronic analogy has been reported @xcite , @xcite , which provided the advantage of exploring the system dynamics in the negative parameter space ( i.e. , negative values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a classical chua s circuit @xcite ) .",
    "present paper reports an inductor - free realization of chua s circuit , in which we have properly cascaded a single amplifier biquad based active band pass filter with a chua s diode .",
    "the system has been mathematically modeled with three - coupled first - order autonomous nonlinear differential equations .",
    "it has been shown through numerical solutions of the mathematical model and real world hardware experiments that the circuit shows all the behaviors of a classical chua s circuit , e.g. , fixed point , limit cycle formation , period doubling cascade , chaotic spiral attractors , double scrolls , and boundary crisis .",
    "occurrence of chaos has been established through lyapunov exponents and experimental power spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized in the following manner : next section describes the proposed circuit and its mathematical modeling .",
    "numerical simulations , computations of nonlinear dynamical measures , e.g. , lyapunov exponents are reported in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "section [ sec:4 ] gives an account of the experimental results .",
    "finally , section [ sec:5 ] concludes the outcome of the whole study .",
    "the proposed circuit is shown in fig.[f1](a ) .",
    "this circuit has two distinct parts : ( i ) a second order narrow band active bandpass filter ( bpf ) , and ( ii ) parallel combination of a grounded capacitor ( @xmath2 ) and chua s diode ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xmath4 node of the bpf is connected to the parallel combination of capacitor @xmath2 and chua s diode ( @xmath3 ) through a passive resistor @xmath5 .",
    "note that , the inductor - capacitor parallel combination of a classical chua s circuit has been replaced by a resonator circuit , which is , in the present circuit , an active bpf ; resonant ( or center ) frequency of the bpf can be controlled by simply varying the resistors @xmath6 or / and @xmath7 ( instead of varying a capacitor , or an inductor ) .",
    "to keep the number of active component lesser we have chosen the single amplifier biquad based narrow band active bpf proposed by deliyannis and friend @xcite , @xcite , which consists of only one single amplifier ( in the form of an op - amp ) , two capacitors having same values ( @xmath8 ) , and four resistors ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this active bpf is a second order system with the following transfer function : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 .",
    "proper choice of @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( and hence @xmath14 ) makes the coefficient of @xmath15 in the denominator negative , which in turn brings the pole of the circuit to the right half of the @xmath15-plane , resulting a sinusoidal oscillation .",
    "real time dynamics of the system can be expressed in terms of the following two coupled first - order autonomous differential equations @xcite :    [ eq1b ] @xmath16    equation ( [ eq1b ] ) can be written as : + @xmath17 it can be seen from ( [ eqn1c ] ) that the bpf can be made to oscillate sinusoidally if one can ensure the following condition : @xmath18 .",
    "this in turn gives the condition of oscillation of the sinusoidal oscillator as : @xmath19 ; subsequently , the frequency of oscillation of the sinusoidal oscillator can be obtained from the condition:@xmath20 .",
    "thus the frequency of oscillation is obtained as : @xmath21 .",
    "chua s diode is characterized by the function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the voltage drop across @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath22 is a three segment piece wise linear function with @xmath24 and @xmath25 as the slopes , and @xmath26 is the break point voltage for those segments .",
    "variation of @xmath22 with @xmath23 has been shown in fig.[f1](b ) ( showing only the three segment region ) .",
    "@xmath22 is defined by : @xmath27 in the present work , we have chosen the voa implementation of chua s diode @xcite as shown in fig.[f1](c ) .",
    "the dynamics of the proposed circuit can be described by three - coupled first - order autonomous nonlinear differential equations in terms of @xmath23 , @xmath4 and @xmath28 ( fig .",

    "numerical integration has been carried out on ( [ eq4 ] ) using fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm with step size @xmath45 .",
    "we have chosen the resistor @xmath6 as the control parameter ( remembering that @xmath6 controls the gain and center frequency of the bpf ) ; thus in the numerical simulations , @xmath46 acts as the control parameter keeping other parameters fixed at : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "note that , the values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are generally used in a classical chua s circuit .",
    "it has been observed that , with increasing @xmath46 , for @xmath54 , the circuit shows a fixed point . for @xmath55 ,",
    "the fixed point loses its stability through hopf bifurcation , and a stable limit cycle emerges . at @xmath56 ,",
    "limit cycle of period-1 becomes unstable and a period-2 ( p2 ) cycle appears .",
    "further period doubling occurs at @xmath57 ( p2 to p4 ) , and @xmath58 ( p4 to p8 ) . through period doubling bifurcation , the circuit enters into the regime of spiral chaos at @xmath59 . with further increase of @xmath46 , at @xmath60 ,",
    "the circuit shows the emergence of a double scroll attractor .",
    "finally , the system - equations show diverging behavior beyond @xmath61 , indicating boundary crises . phase plane representation ( in @xmath62 plane ) for different @xmath46",
