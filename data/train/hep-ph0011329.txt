    "the most recent results of , which measures the size of the direct cp violation in @xmath2 , reported by ktev @xcite and na48 @xcite lead to a world average of re  = @xmath3  @xcite . this result is higher than the standard model ( sm ) predictions @xcite , opening the way to the interpretation that it may be a signal of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the sm predictions for suffer from large theoretical uncertainties @xcite such that one can not draw a definite conclusion if this observed high value of can be accommodated in the sm . in any case , one may wonder if the supersymmetry ( susy ) can be responsible for enhancing .    in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm )",
    "there is no way of generating a siable susy contribution to even if one assume that the susy cp violating phases are large and the electric dipole moments ( edm ) of the electron and neutron are less than the experimental bounds due to the cancellation between the different contributions .",
    "this is mainly due to the assumption of universal boundary conditions of the soft - breaking terms @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , without new flavor structure beyond the usual yukawa couplings , general susy models with phases of the soft terms of order @xmath4 ( but with a vanishing ckm phase @xmath5 ) can not give a sizeable contribution to the cp violating processes @xcite .",
    "this means that the presence of non  universal soft breaking terms besides large susy phases is crucial to enhance these cp violation effects . in agreement with this",
    ", it has been explicitly shown that contributions to @xmath6 are small within the dilaton  dominated susy breaking of the weakly coupled heterotic string model  @xcite , where @xmath0terms as well as gaugino masses are universal . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well  known that the strict universality in the soft breaking sector is a strong assumption not realized in many supergravity and string inspired models  @xcite .",
    "all these arguments indicate not only that the presence of non  universal soft terms can solve the problem of too large contributions to edms but also that it allows for large susy contributions in cp violation experiments .",
    "hence , in this work we will follow this avenue and analyze the effects of non  universal soft terms in cp violation in the @xmath7system  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in susy models there are new possibilities for cp violation . in particular , the soft susy breaking terms contain several parameters that may be complex , as can also be the @xmath8-parameter . in the minimal supergravity model",
    "there are only two new cp - violating phases .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath8 can be complex .",
    "but of these four phases only two are physical .",
    "first , by an r - rotation with r - charge @xmath11 for lepton and quark superfields and @xmath12 for the vector and the higgs superfields , the gaugino mass parameter @xmath13 can be made real .",
    "second , @xmath14 can be made real by a change of phase of the higgs superfield .",
    "this ensures that the higgs vacuum expectation values are real .",
    "the remaining phases can not be defined away and violate cp .",
    "one is in @xmath15 and the other in @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath8 parameter then has a fixed phase @xmath17 . in any phase convention _",
    "a= ( am^ * ) , _ b= ( bm^ * ) .",
    "these phases can cause at one loop level an electric dipole moment ( edm ) for the quarks and leptons , and therefore also for the neutron .",
    "it has been known for a long time that in the susy models the contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment are larger than the experimental limit @xmath18 e cm unless either the new ` susy phases ' are tuned to be of order @xmath19 , or the susy masses are of order a tev .",
    "such small phases can not generate sizable cp violation .",
    "also they constitute a fine tuning .",
    "this is known as  susy cp problem \" .",
    "however , in the last few it has been suggested that a natural cancellation mechanism exists whereby the electric dipole moment of the neutron may be made small without such fine - tuning . in this case",
    "large susy phases are expected and still satisfy experimental bounds on the values of edm of the electron and neutron .    in this section",
    "we will study the effect of these phases in cp violation observables as and .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 to maximize this effect .",
    "the value of the indirect cp violation in the kaon decays , @xmath21 , is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 gev . the amplitude @xmath24 .",
    "the relevant supersymmetric contributions to @xmath25 are the gluino and the chargino contributions , ( , the transition proceeds through box diagrams exchanging gluino - squarks and chargino - squarks ) .",
    "it is usually expected that the gluino is the dominant contribution . however , as we will show , it is impossible in the case of degenerate @xmath0-terms that the gluino gives any significant contribution to @xmath21 when the ckm matrix is taken to be real even with large phase of @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude of the gluino contribution is given in terms of the mass insertion @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is an average sfermion mass and @xmath29 is off - diagonal terms in the sfermion mass matrices .",
    "the mass insertion to accomplish the transition from @xmath30 to @xmath31 ( @xmath32 are flavor indices ) is given by @xmath33(3\\tilde{m}^2+\\vert x \\vert^2 ) , \\\\",
    "( \\delta^d_{lr})_{ij}&\\simeq&-\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}\\left[\\frac{k^{\\dag } ( m_u^{diag})^2 k\\ m_d}{v^2 \\sin^2\\beta \\cos\\beta }     \\right ] \\ln(\\frac{m_{gut}}{m_w } ) x , \\\\ ( \\delta^d_{rl})_{ij}&\\simeq&-\\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}\\left[\\frac{m_d\\ k^{\\dag } ( m_u^{diag})^2 k } { v^2 \\sin^2\\beta \\cos\\beta } \\right ] \\ln(\\frac{m_{gut}}{m_w } ) x , \\\\ ( \\delta^d_{rr})_{ij}&=&0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath35 in general are complex due to the complexity of the ckm matrix , the trilinear coupling @xmath0 and @xmath8 parameter .",
    "here we assume the vanishing of @xmath36 to analyze the effect of the susy phases .",
    "we notice that @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath38 , it is real and does not contribute to @xmath21 whatever the phase of @xmath0 is",
    ". moreover , the values of the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are proportional to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , hence they are quite small .",
    "indeed in this case we find the gluino contribution to @xmath21 is of order @xmath43 .    for the chargino contribution the amplitude",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the complete expression for these function can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . for low and modurate values of @xmath45",
    "the value of @xmath46 is much smaller than @xmath47 since it is suppressed by the ratio of @xmath41 to @xmath48 .",
    "however , by neglecting the flavor mixing in the squark mass matrix @xmath47 turned out to be exactly real  @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath47 is associated to the size of the intergenerational sfermion mixings , thus it is maximal for large @xmath45 .",
    "in low @xmath45 case , that we consider , the imaginary part of @xmath47 is very small , and the gluino contribution is still the dominant contribution @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , we found that is of order @xmath43 , which is less than the experimental value @xmath49 .",
    "now we consider the effect of these two phases ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) on the direct cp violation parameter .",
    "similar to the case of indirect cp violation parameter , in the gluino contribution the @xmath52@xmath52 transitions are almost real and the @xmath52@xmath53 transitions are suppressed by two up yukawa couplings and a down quark mass . moreover ,",
    "the analysis of chargino contribution is also the same as in the indirect cp violation .",
    "even the experimental bounds on the branching ratio of @xmath54 decay impose sever constraint on the lr transition .",
    "therefore we do not find any significant susy cp violation effect in too .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that cp violation effects are always very small in susy models with universal soft susy breaking terms . recently",
    ", it has been shown that the non  universality of @xmath0terms is very effective to generate large cp violation effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , the presence of non ",
    "degenerate @xmath0terms is essential for enhancing the gluino contributions to @xmath55 through large imaginary parts of the @xmath52@xmath53 mass insertions , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "these susy contributions can , indeed , account for a sizeable part of the recently measured experimental value of @xmath55 @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will present an explicit realization of such mechanism in the framework of a type i superstring inspired susy model . within this model ,",
    "it is possible to obtain non  universal soft breaking terms , i.e. scalar masses , gaugino masses and trilinear couplings .",
    "type i string models contain nine  branes and three types of five  branes ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "if we assume that the gauge group @xmath60 is on one of the branes ( 9brane ) and the gauge group @xmath61 is on another brane ( @xmath62brane ) .",
    "chiral matter fields correspond to open strings spanning between branes .",
    "thus , they have non  vanishing quantum numbers only for the gauge groups corresponding to the branes between which the open string spans . for example",
    ", the chiral field corresponding to the open string between the @xmath63 and @xmath61 branes can have non  trivial representations under both @xmath63 and @xmath61 , while the chiral field corresponding to the open string , which starts and ends on the @xmath63brane , should be an @xmath61singlet .",
    "there is only one type of the open string which spans between the 9 and @xmath62branes , which we denote it as @xmath64 .",
    "however , there are three types of open strings which could start and end on the 9brane , that is , the @xmath65 sectors ( i=1,2,3 ) , which corresponding to the @xmath66-th complex compact dimension among the three complex dimensions .",
    "if we assign the three families to the different @xmath65 sectors we obtain non  universality in the right  handed sector .",
    "in particular , we assign the @xmath67 sector to the third family and @xmath68 and @xmath69 to the first and second families respectively . under these assumption the soft susy breaking terms are obtained , following the formulae in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the gaugino masses are obtained @xmath70 while the @xmath0-terms are obtained as @xmath71 for the coupling including @xmath72 , i.e. the third family , @xmath73 for the coupling including @xmath74 , i.e. the second family and @xmath75 for the coupling including @xmath76 , i.e. the first family . here",
    "@xmath77 is the gravitino mass , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the cp phases of the f - terms of the dilaton field @xmath80 and the three moduli fields @xmath81 , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are goldstino angles , and we have the constraint , @xmath84 .",
    "thus , if quark fields correspond to different @xmath85 sectors , we have non  universal a  terms",
    ". then we obtain the following a  matrix for both of the up and down sectors , @xmath86 note that the non  universality appears only for the right  handed sector .",
    "the trilinear susy breaking matrix , @xmath87 , itself is obtained @xmath88 in matrix notation .",
    "in addition , soft scalar masses for quark doublets and the higgs fields are obtained , @xmath89 the soft scalar masses for quark singlets are obtained as @xmath90 if it corresponds to the @xmath91 sector .    in models with non - degenerate @xmath0terms we have to fix the yukawa matrices to completely specify the model .",
    "in fact , with universal @xmath0terms the textures of the yukawa matrices at gut scale affect the physics at ew scale only through the quark masses and usual ckm matrix , since the extra parameters contained in the yukawa matrices can be eliminated by unitary fields transformations . this is no longer true with non - degenerate @xmath0terms . here ,",
    "we choose our yukawa texture to be y^u=",
    "( m_u , m_c , m_t )  ,   y^d= k^ ( m_d , m_s , m_b ) k where @xmath7 is the ckm matrix . in this case one",
    "find that the mass inserion @xmath92 can be written as  @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is an average squark mass and @xmath95 the quark mass .",
    "this expression shows the main effects of the non ",
    "universal @xmath0terms . in the first place",
    ", we can see that the diagonal elements are still very similar to the universal @xmath0terms situation .",
    "apart of the usual scaling with the quark mass , these flavor  diagonal mass insertions receive dominant contributions from the corresponding @xmath96 terms plus an approximately equal contribution from gluino to all three generations and an identical @xmath8 term contribution .",
    "hence , given that the gluino rg effects are dominant , also the phases of these terms tend to align with the gluino phase , as in the minimal supergravity . therefore , edm bounds constrain mainly the relative phase between @xmath8 and gluino ( or chargino ) and give a relatively weaker constraint to the relative phase between @xmath97 ( the first generation @xmath0term ) and the relevant gaugino .",
    "effects of different @xmath96 in these elements are suppressed by squared ckm mixing angles .",
    "however , flavor  off ",
    "diagonal elements are completely new in this model",
    ". they do not receive significant contributions from gluino nor from @xmath8 and so their phases are still determined by the @xmath96 phases and , in principle , they do not directly contribute to edms .",
    "= 11 cm    in figure [ scat ] we show the allowed values for @xmath78 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 assuming @xmath100 . we have imposed the edm , and @xmath54 bounds with the usual bounds on susy masses .",
    "we can see that , similarly to the minimal supergravity , @xmath101 is constrained to be very close to the gluino and chargino phases ( in the plot @xmath102 ) , but @xmath98 and @xmath99 are completely unconstrained .    finally , in figure [ eps ] we show the values of @xmath103 versus the gluino mass in the same regions of parameter space and with the same constraints as in figure [ scat ] .",
    "as we can see due to the effect of the off - diagonal phases a large percentage of points are above or close to @xmath104 , hence , sizeable supersymmetric contribution to @xmath105 can be expected in the presence of non - universal @xmath0terms .",
    "non  universal supersymmetry soft breaking terms are a natural consequence in many supergravity or string inspired susy models . moreover , the non  universality of the @xmath0terms has a significant effect in the cp violation .",
    "we have shown that in these models a sizeable supersymmetric contribution to cp observables and can be easily obtained .",
