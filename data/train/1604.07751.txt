    "linear filtering with filters that have a phase - only transfer function finds numerous applications in optics ranging from phase - only diffractive optics elements ( doe ) , through modeling of fresnel diffraction , and the spreading of a pulse envelope in a dispersive medium , up to optical pattern recognition  @xcite .",
    "it is rarely realized that matrices which represent discrete phase - only filtering , in contrast to matrices of other kinds of linear filtering , are always unitary .",
    "this property motivated us to further investigate the possibility of using pof as a compression matrix within the framework of compressive sensing , which is the main topic of this paper .",
    "compressive sensing  @xcite(cs ) is a rapidly developing field of mathematics and signal processing with important contributions to the introduction of novel measurement methodologies and information recovery techniques that take advantage of the compressibility of the measured signal . in optics ,",
    "cs has been initially applied for computational ghost imaging  @xcite and imaging with a single - pixel camera ( spc )  @xcite , which allows for capturing images with a sole bucket detector rather than with a high - resolution array of detectors .",
    "this architecture opens the way for economic electro - optical imaging systems for infrared wavelengths  @xcite , as well as for imaging in more exotic ranges of electromagnetic radiation , such as terahertz  @xcite or millimeter waves  @xcite .",
    "the growing range of research directions and applications based on cs now include 3d imaging  @xcite , lidar imaging  @xcite , joint measurement of distance to the object and its shape  @xcite and development of 3d laser - radar devices  @xcite .",
    "cs finds applications in medical imaging  @xcite and imaging through scattering media  @xcite .",
    "it has been also applied for spectrometry  @xcite , stokes polarimetric imaging  @xcite and hyperspectral imaging  @xcite , and holography  @xcite .",
    "image encryption with compression is another major application of cs  @xcite .",
    "@xcite includes a recent review of cs in the field of information security .",
    "in this paper we focus on the possibility of using a compressive measurement of an image , in particular a measurement from a single - pixel detector , for the recovery of the spatially filtered image , when this filtered image is a lot more sparse than the original image .",
    "we show that filtering with a phase - only - filter is particularly interesting , not only because of its importance in optics but also thanks to the unitary form of the filtering matrix .",
    "we propose a pattern recognition method applicable to compressive measurements based on filtering with a phase - only matched filter  ( pof )  @xcite and lasso optimization  @xcite .",
    "this may be regarded as a refined concept of the smashed filter where a matched filter was used for target localization  @xcite . in ref .  @xcite it has been reported that a target object may be found at high compression rates .",
    "we demonstrate that images measured compressively at extremely high compression rates , at which their proper reconstruction with a quality allowing for visual examination is no longer possible , may still contain sufficient information for pattern recognition and target localization . at the same time we point to the possibility of using pof rather than other matched filters for compressive pattern recognition since it allows to obtain a very fast and efficient recovery algorithm .",
    "in this section we explain the use of linear filtering as a compression operator within the framework of compressive sensing .      in cs - based measurement methods , the signal or image @xmath0",
    "is usually reconstructed from a compressive measurement @xmath1 @xmath2 where the size of the signal is @xmath3 and the size of the measurement @xmath1 is @xmath4 .",
    "the measurement matrix @xmath5 includes information on the measurement method and its size is @xmath6 .",
    "it is additionally assumed that the signal is compressible i.e. there exists an _ a priori _ unknown sparse representation of the signal @xmath7 with at most @xmath8 non - zero elements , whereas the size of @xmath9 and @xmath0 is the same and is equal to @xmath3 .    in order to recover the signal from the measurement it is necessary to solve the optimization problem such as basis pursuit denoising or lasso  @xcite .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath10 where matrix @xmath11 is defined as the product of the measurement and compression matrices , which should be maximally incoherent , @xmath12 then , following ( [ eq.lasso ] ) , @xmath13 is determined as an approximate solution to the underdetermined set of linear equations @xmath14 with an imposed constraint on the @xmath15 norm @xmath16 .",
    "lasso optimization ( [ eq.lasso ] ) tends to recover a sparse solution @xmath13 to the set of linear equations , or a solution which contains lots of small elements such that @xmath17 .",
    "efficient numerical algorithms exist for solving the problem ( [ eq.lasso ] ) , when the matrix @xmath11 is orthogonal or semi - orthogonal ( unitary or semi - unitary for complex matrices ) .",
    "a rectangular and right invertible matrix is semi - unitary if its product with its complex conjugate transpose gives an identity matrix @xmath18 a straightforward way to assure the ( semi)orthogonality of @xmath11 is by selecting ( semi)orthogonal matrices @xmath5 and @xmath19 .",
    "we are now going to focus on matrices @xmath19 that correspond to linear filtering .",
    "such matrices have a toeplitz form and in case of digital processing usually a circulant form which is a special case of a toeplitz matrix .",
    "a @xmath20 circulant matrix may be defined with an @xmath3 element vector @xmath21 as @xmath22 a circulant matrix is diagonalized by one - dimensional discrete unitary fourier transform ( dft ) @xmath23 ( vectors and matrices in the fourier - domain will be shortly denoted with a caret ) , i.e. @xmath24 is a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements @xmath25 consisting of the dft of the vector @xmath21 , i.e. @xmath26 finally , a left - multiplication of a vector @xmath27 by @xmath19 corresponds to a circulant convolution between vectors @xmath27 and @xmath21 i.e. @xmath28 for convenience we are using a one - dimensional notation . in two dimensions @xmath23",
    "is replaced by the two - dimensional dft @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the kronecker product .",
    "images are stored in a vector form , while the circulant matrix is now block - circulant . in a shift - invariant linear system , @xmath21 is often called the point spread function , and @xmath31 the transfer function .",
    "circulant matrices representing linear filters need not to be orthogonal ( or unitary for complex matrices ) .",
    "however , an important class of unitary filters exists , namely the phase - only filters ( pof ) .",
    "in fact , when the transfer function of the filter is of the form @xmath32_k=\\exp(i \\phi_k),\\ ] ] using ( [ eq.mft ] ) and ( [ eq.transfer ] ) we may check that @xmath33 is unitary : @xmath34      circulant matrices defined in the fourier space with phase - only random elements have been used for sampling in cs by romberg  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced basis pursuit and related optimization algorithms applicable to several kinds of toeplitz and circulant matrices , however solving the optimization problem ( [ eq.lasso ] ) is simpler for unitary matrices and in consequence for pof than for other filters .",
    "we propose to apply pof as the compression matrix @xmath19 in the framework of lasso optimization . therefore equation ( [ eq.mt ] ) takes the form @xmath35 filters with a phase - only transfer function are of great importance to optics  @xcite .",
    "for instance , fresnel diffraction is a kind of pof spatial filtering occurring during propagation .",
    "indeed , the respective two - dimensional transfer function in the spatial frequency domain @xmath36 for the propagation at the distance @xmath37 equals @xmath38    in time domain the evolution of a pulse envelope is also within the second - order dispersion approximation described as pof - filtering .",
    "more general pof spatial filtering may be realized in numerous correlator - based architectures e.g.  @xcite , with phase - only spatial light modulators ( slm ) .",
    "phase - only modulation makes use of the total light energy incident on an slm , and is characterized with a high diffraction efficiency .",
    "there exist coding methods for phase diffractive optical elements ( doe ) such as iterative fourier transform algorithm which allow to encode a rather general response in phase - only elements .",
    "finally , pof matched filters have been applied to optical pattern recognition constituting a recognition method with a high discrimination capacity .",
    "phase - only filtering techniques have been successfully used for phase visualization as well as for optical encryption .",
    "the use of pof filtering jointly with cs in optics depends on its actual capability to produce a compressed signal representation .",
    "let us examine some of the aforementioned examples .",
    "for instance , a sharp image produced by fresnel diffraction at the image plane of an imaging set - up is likely to be more sparse than the same image out of focus .",
    "a pulse envelope becomes sparse at a distance which corresponds to the highest pulse compression . in the next subsection and the rest of the paper we will focus on the pof matched filter .",
    "pof filter is one of the basic filters used in optical correlation - based pattern recognition .",
    "it is defined as @xmath32_k={\\hat r_k^*}/|\\hat r_k|,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the target image . the correlation signal with the analyzed input scene",
    "@xmath0 is equal to @xmath40    the intensity distribution in @xmath41 contains image - recognition information with narrow detection - peaks at the locations of the recognized target images .",
    "it should be noted that the pof has been introduced to optical pattern recognition mainly because of the possibility to encode it on phase - only diffractive elements and in particular on spatial light modulators , while here we make use of its unitary form .",
    "it is also known to have a good discrimination capability but its definition does not result from a simple theoretical image formation model .    on top of that , pof - filtering is a unitary circulant transform which may be directly included in the cs framework .",
    "it is also important that this kind of filtering tends to transform images containing a target object into a representation with a high sparsity .    with multiple target images stored in a dictionary @xmath42 it is also needed to normalize the correlation signals before they could be compared . without further assumptions on the statistics of target occurrences ,",
    "@xmath43 may be used for target classification , where @xmath44 goes through the set of reference objects : @xmath45    both @xmath9 and @xmath41 are sparse , provided that the distribution of target objects is sparse and that the cross - correlation with background objects is small .",
    "this last example will now be further examined alongside with the pure - phase correlation ( ppc ) defined as @xmath46 which is also a well established pattern recognition method equivalent to pof - filtering of the whitened input scene .",
    "a compressive measurement for the ppc is based on @xmath47 rather than on @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath48 unlike pof , ppc belongs to nonlinear filtering techniques  @xcite with certain adaptive properties  @xcite . for both pof and ppc",
    ", @xmath9 is sparse and pof is unitary , therefore it is direct to apply lasso optimization ( [ eq.lasso ] ) , which returns the correlation plane @xmath9 .",
    "if one needs to reconstruct the input scene @xmath0 or @xmath47 from the same compressive measurement , conjugate phase - only filtering may be applied to @xmath9 . however , as we will demonstrate , target recognition can be still implemented at compression rates at which visual examination of a reconstructed image is no longer possible .",
    "in numerical experiments we found that lasso - based compressive matched pof filtering is particularly efficient when the compressive measurements are taken with measurement matrix @xmath5 consisting of rows with randomly selected wh basis , while the ppc correlation gives even better results with discrete noiselet basis . the wh transformation matrix",
    "whose size is a power of two has the following recursive form @xmath49 \\quad\\textrm{with}\\quad   h_1=1.\\label{eq.wh}\\ ] ] a respective formula for the discrete noiselet transformation is  @xcite @xmath50,\\label{eq.noiselets}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 .",
    "same as for dft , the two - dimensional transforms are obtained through the kronecker product of one - dimensional transforms , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53    .",
    "detection is based on pof - filtering for wh and dft sampling , and on ppc for noiselet sampling .",
    "probabilities shown with solid lines have been calculated for the target object in the presence of the false - target and the background , and probabilities shown with dashed lines have been obtained with an additional additive ( snr=0  db ) .",

    "we include the results obtained with dft for comparisons , however its optical implementation would be a lot more problematic . actually ,",
    "while all these methods can be easily applied numerically , only the pof - wh case can be straightforwardly implemented in an optical single - pixel detector with a binary modulator , with real non - negative images and without input scene whitening ( [ eq.white ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn1 ] we present a comparison between the three methods applied to a @xmath55 @xmath56-bit input scene showing the surface of sea with two ships : a target object and a false - target object .",
    "the scene is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.target ] .",
    "both ships have a similar brightness , orientation and size .",
    "this scene has been compressively measured using three different methods : i )  with wh sampling - according to eq .",

    "( [ eq.measurment2 ] ) with matrix @xmath5 consisting of randomly selected rows of matrix  ( [ eq.noiselets ] ) .",
    "then , the reconstruction of the pof correlation signal  ( [ eq.correl ] ) or ppc ( [ eq.white ] ) has been obtained by solving lasso optimization  ( [ eq.lasso ] ) with matrix @xmath11 defined in eq .",

    "correct recognition is possible up to extremely high compression ratios on the order of @xmath59 .",
    "this value is problem - dependent and varies with the size of the image and its content . in ref .",
    "@xcite for a different image , and a more general form of nonlinear correlation - based pattern recognition method , compression rates of @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) have been reported .",
    "we are using the spgl1 package for lasso optimization  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm has usually converged in @xmath62@xmath63 newton iterations with an execution time of @xmath62@xmath63 seconds . at the same time it fails to converge for other filters than pof i.e. for non - unitary circulant operators @xmath19 .",
    "the short convergence time of the algorithm comes in contrast to many reports of cs applications with long recovery times .",
    "we evaluate the noiselet and fast wh transforms in matlab , and they are tenfold slower compared to e.g. the highly optimized fast fourier transform ( fft ) on the same computer ( for a @xmath55 image ) . since fft involves complex floating point arithmetic , and the numerical complexity of these transforms is similar , therefore the convergence time could be potentially still scaled down significantly .",
    "theoretically , it is equivalent to recover either the original image or the pof - filtered image , as they can be easily transformed one into the other through direct or conjugate filtering .",
    "however , an approximate recovery of the ( sparse ) correlation plane with an accuracy sufficient for target detection applications is possible at much higher compression rates and , in effect , it is also a lot faster . the input scene from fig .  [ fig.target ]",
    "could be approximately reconstructed from the wh - based compressive measurement @xmath1 for compression rates @xmath64",
    ". however , such recovery is no longer possible at @xmath65 , while the target may still be detected .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn2 ] , which shows the clearly visible target detection signal reconstructed at @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn2](a ) ) alongside with the reconstructed input scene ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn2](b,c ) , for the reconstruction from conjugate filtering , and for direct reconstruction ) .    as another example",
    "we consider a combined localization and classification problem with a two - element pof dictionary and input scenes with between @xmath62 and @xmath66 randomly located non - overlapping ships of the two kinds .",
    "an example of such an input scene is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn3](a ) .",
    "the detection is considered to be successful when all objects in the scene are correctly detected and classified . in every experiment , the detection signal is reconstructed for all reference objects from the dictionary ( in our case the dictionary contains two objects ) and is normalized by the respective norm of the reference object according to eq .",
    "( [ eq.multi ] ) to make the detection signal independent of the intensity of reference objects .",
    "the locations of the highest correlation peaks are then compared against the actual locations of the target objects . once again , the percentage of detection has been calculated based on @xmath57 recognition experiments - for every scenario and compression ratio . as may be expected , the acceptable compression rate decreases with the number of objects , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn3](b ) , nonetheless it remains high .",
    "we have validated the proposed pof - based compressive target recognition method experimentally using an optical single - pixel detector shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.schem ] .",
    "we have used a @xmath67 pixel area of the ti lightcrafter dlp-4500 micromirror device ( dmd ) with a skew ( @xmath68 ) orientation with respect to the display matrix to project wh patterns onto the analyzed image .",
    "this image transformation is similar as in ref .",
    "@xcite and is dictated by the way the dmd pixels are ordered and addressed within the diamond lattice .",
    "wh functions have been normalized to take binary values of @xmath69 .",
    "then they have been grouped into @xmath70-bit packets , streamed through the hdmi bus to the dlp and displayed at the frequency of @xmath71  hz .",
    "apart from the wh functions , we have also projected their negation .",
    "this allowed us to conduct a differential measurement and to eliminate an unknown bias from the experimental set - up .",
    "the detector consisted of a photo - diode integrated with an on - chip transimpedance amplifier ( ti opt-101p ) , and of a @xmath72-bit a / d converter ( ni usb-6003 100ks / s multifunction daq ) .",
    "its distance from the object is approximately @xmath66  m. the same set - up has been also described in ref .",
    "@xcite with the only difference that here we use wh bases instead of noiselets .",
    "( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d )    in fig .",
    "[ fig.experim](a)(b ) we show the @xmath67 synthetic image used in the experiment and its reconstruction from a full set of wh basis .",
    "apart from the nonuniform illumination that could be accounted for with simple post - processing , the low snr on the order of @xmath58  db is probably the most important limitation of the set - up .",
    "the snr value results from the peak - to - peak amplitude of the measurements taken for different wh functions , which is approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than the average value of measured signal .",
    "this effectively reduces the useful resolution of the a / d converter by @xmath73-@xmath74 bits . in fig .",
    "[ fig.experim](c ) we show the probability of correct target location within the radius of @xmath66 pixels from the exact location obtained experimentally at various compression rates",
    ". a smaller resolution than in the theoretical study presented before in fig .",
    "[ fig.recogn1 ] as well as the finite snr limit the acceptable level of compression .",
    "the experimental results agree with the theoretical prediction for the estimated level of snr=@xmath58  db .",
    "nonetheless the results clearly demonstrate that cs - based recovery of the correlation signal from an incomplete measurement is feasible . a sample reconstruction of the image at @xmath75 when it is still possible to detect the target but not to see it is shown in fig  [ fig.experim](d ) .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the application of circulant matrices as compression operators for cs in optics , and we have demonstrated a compressive pattern recognition technique which allows to detect and localize a target object from a compressive measurement .",
    "it encapsulates lasso optimization , a phase - only matched filter or a pure - phase correlation adapted from optical correlation - based pattern recognition methods and a non - adaptive walsh - hadamard - based or noiselet - based compressive measurement .",
    "we have shown in a numerical experiment that for @xmath76 pixel scenes with a relatively sparse distribution of objects in the presence of a nonuniform background it is fast and reliable at extreme compression rates of @xmath77 .",
    "the acceptable compression rate is smaller at lower resolutions , more complex images , and in the presence of noise .",
    "probably the most important practical conclusion is that the application of a pof filter in a cs framework as the compression matrix leads to a very efficient recovery algorithm ( we have obtained execution times on the order of @xmath62-@xmath63 seconds for @xmath55-pixel images ) .    like any pattern recognition method and any compressive measurement",
    ", the performance of the reconstruction methods discussed in this paper is signal - dependent .",
    "the proposed method can be seen as a reimplementation of pof ( or ppc ) filtering for walsh - hadamard - based or noiselet - based compressive measurements .",
    "it converges to pof ( ppc ) at the compression rate of @xmath62 .",
    "the study of various noise - models , or generalizations of the algorithm to other transformation invariances than shift invariance  @xcite , while possible , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have shown how to use the proposed method with data from an optical single - pixel detector . at the same time",
    "non - adaptive compression is also interesting for purely numerical applications , where an image database is created at some time and stored for future reference , and at the time of storage there is no prior knowledge of the target elements it will be later scanned for . in many areas data inflow",
    "grows faster than computational power and cs - based techniques , like the one discussed here , will be gaining importance .",
