    "competing electronic phases underlie a number of the most unconventional phenomena in condensed matter systems . when this competition is sufficiently strong , the usual outcome is a phase separation .",
    "one outstanding example of this situation is provided by materials showing colossal magnetoresistance , where competing magnetic interactions lead to phase separation between conducting ferromagnetic and insulating antiferromagnetic ( afm ) regions @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", an external magnetic field can be used to control the resistance over many orders of magnitude , offering possible applications in electronic devices . in cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the competition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity forms the basis for the majority of the observed phenomena and for several classes of materials the debate can be phrased in terms of the extent to which phase separation is the outcome . the stripe phase , which has been the object of heated research interest for two decades , can be considered as a form of atomic - scale phase separation between afm and superconducting ( sc ) regions , and such self - organizing heterostructures are a direct reflection of the electronic correlations whose effects are essential to understanding the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the competition between afm and sc phases also forms the foundation for the physics of iron - based superconductors @xcite , where it is manifest in the emergence of a tetragonal sc phase upon doping- or pressure - induced suppression of an orthorhombic afm phase .",
    "iron - based superconductors have in common a quasi - two - dimensional atomic structure of weakly coupled feas or fese planes , although the exact crystal structure varies somewhat among the 1111 , 122 , 111 , and 11 families of materials @xcite ; in fact the phenomena we report here will highlight some of the important differences arising between families as a consequence of the strength of their interplane coupling .",
    "currently , the detailed phase diagram close to optimal doping ( the concentration giving the maximum sc transition temperature , @xmath8 ) remains hotly debated , with evidence cited in favor of phase coexistence , of a possible afm quantum critical point , or of heterostructures of afm and sc phases .",
    "the levels of doping and disorder , and their impact on the phases and their competition , seem to vary between structural families , defying any search for universal properties .",
    "however , this variety does open additional avenues in the search for novel forms of phase separation or heterostructure formation , and with them the scope for obtaining further clues to the mechanism of high-@xmath8 superconductivity .",
    "the 111 family is based on the materials lifeas and nafeas , with doping effected most easily as nafe@xmath2co@xmath3as .",
    "the parent compound nafeas has a separate structural transition ( @xmath9 55 k ) and magnetic transition ( @xmath10 41 k ) @xcite , the latter to an afm phase with small ordered moments ( @xmath11 0.32@xmath12/fe ) @xcite .",
    "here we choose to use the notation @xmath13 , rather than @xmath14 , to reflect the strong local - moment character of the magnetic phase , an issue to which we return in sec .",
    "the separation of @xmath15 and @xmath13 , and also the relatively low @xmath13 values , count among the initial pieces of evidence for a rather weak interlayer coupling @xcite between feas planes in the nafeas system .",
    "the crystal quality , particularly the homogeneity of dopant distribution , is thought to be among the best in any iron - based superconductors , as measured in transition widths and observed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) .",
    "nevertheless , for underdoped 111 compounds a coexistence of inhomogeneous antiferromagnetism and superconductivity has been suggested by transport @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite , and stm measurements @xcite . by contrast , the `` coexistence '' of a strongly ordered afm phase ( _ s_-afm ) and a weakly ordered one ( _ w_-afm ) on different spatial sites ( this situation may be denoted more specifically as a `` cohabitation '' ) has been reported from nmr measurements @xcite .",
    "clearly a phase inhomogeneity is observed in all of these studies .",
    "however , a detailed analysis of the intrinsic properties of the primary phases , of the exact phase diagram around optimal doping , and of the different phase volume fractions , is still required .    in this paper",

    "optimal , we find at @xmath17 0.0175 ( @xmath18 20 k ) the onset of regions of antiferromagnetism below 25 k , where the afm volume grows with cooling but the application of a magnetic field suppresses both @xmath13 and the magnetic volume fraction . at lower temperatures , superconductivity enters in the pm phase and",
    "its volume fraction increases at the expense of the afm region both on cooling and ( somewhat paradoxically ) with increasing field . for @xmath19",
    "( @xmath18 22 k ) , superconductivity suppresses not only afm order but also the critical afm fluctuations below @xmath8 , forming in the terminology of some authors the mechanism by which the afm quantum critical point is `` avoided . ''",
    "our results present direct evidence for the mutual exclusion of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , which leads to a `` volume competition '' between regions of established ( finite - order - parameter ) phases replacing each other in space in a first - order manner .",
    "this volume competition can be controlled systematically by the temperature and magnetic field , and we suggest that it exists in many other iron - based superconductors .",
    "our detailed studies of the spin - lattice relaxation rate across the phase diagram indicate the importance of both itinerant ( conduction - electron ) and local - moment ( valence - electron ) contributions to both types of order . a theoretical interpretation of the strong competition points to the key role of the very two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi surfaces in 111 systems and to orbital - selective phenomena depending on the specific bands involved at the different fermi surfaces .",

    "however , as noted in sec .",
    "iii , the situation in nafe@xmath2co@xmath3as does not appear to be the same , first in that structural and hence doping inhomogeneity is significant in 245 materials and second in that weak superconductivity can be observed throughout the sample below @xmath8 . in sec .",

    "microscopically , in the absence of doping inhomogeneity effects , the scale of the phenomenon is expected to result from a subtle interplay between electronic correlations and lattice or charge inhomogeneities ( independent of co doping ) , and could indeed be on the nanometer scale .",
    "first - order phase separation close to the afm quantum phase transition has certainly been suggested in other iron - based sc materials , most notably bafe@xmath121ni@xmath3as@xmath44 , although the fact that @xmath15 and @xmath13 merge in the 122 systems may cause qualitative differences in the phase diagram .",

    "the low - energy spin fluctuations causing the curie - weiss upturn in @xmath43 , and hence determining @xmath83 , are due only to fermi - surface electrons , so the equality with @xmath13 indicates only very weak contributions to long - range order from an inter - plane interaction @xmath96 ( sec .",

    "this result , demonstrating clearly the extremely 2d nature of the nafeas system , suggests that the cornerstone of a microscopic model should be the itinerant contribution to ( planar ) magnetic order , without which the local - moment interactions appear quite unable to order alone .    finally , we comment that the suppression of antiferromagnetism by superconductivity at low temperatures for the @xmath6 sample , even though @xmath13 exceeds @xmath8 , indicates that the sc phase possesses additional electronic or magnetic channels with which it can `` win '' against afm order .",
    "a full microscopic model of the band structure , fermi surfaces , and correlation effects due to valence - electron contributions is required to account for this effect , and here we can only present the possibilities suggested by our data .",
    "one may be that superconductivity competes only with the afm tendencies of the itinerant electrons , which in other iron - based superconductors are reinforced by sizeable local - moment contributions , but that ( previous paragraph ) the extremely 2d nature of nafeas weakens this link to the point that the afm phase is disrupted completely .",
    "the microscopic physics underlying such behavior will be found naturally in an orbital - specific model . even in a fully 2d system ,",
    "the electronic bands of iron pnictides contain five different @xmath125-orbitals , and hence many degrees of freedom in orbital symmetries and admixtures .",
    "antiferromagnetism and superconductivity are favored by itinerant electrons in bands of different orbital content , and",
    "the unique feature of nafe@xmath2co@xmath3as is that the band occupations , and thus their fermi surfaces , are inordinately sensitive to the doping because of the highly 2d nature of the system .",
    "a recent arpes study of nafe@xmath2co@xmath3as samples with small and large @xmath27 @xcite has provided some indications for orbital - selective connections between the competing afm and sc phases , specifically concerning the relative @xmath126 and @xmath127 content of the bands near the fermi surface .",
    "we suggest that similarly detailed studies of samples near optimal doping have the potential to reveal the underlying physics of nafeas .    in summary , by using nmr as a local probe sensitive to both antiferromagnetism and superconductivity ,",
    "we observe a strong volume competition between the two phases at the boundary of the antiferromagnetic phase transition in nafe@xmath2co@xmath3as .",
    "the volume fractions of the two phases can be controlled by varying both the temperature and the applied magnetic field , and show a complete mutual exclusion in real space .",
    "thus our nmr data support a first - order phase transition between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity , which is driven by the competition between their electronic order parameters in reciprocal space . as striking as the volume competition effect is the exquisite sensitivity of the competition to doping , with optimal doping and all of the phase - separation effects occuring between 0 and 2% .",
    "these phenomena have their origin in the extremely weak interplane coupling in the nafeas materials , resulting in a very two - dimensional nature of the electronic band structure , and hence of the fermi surfaces . one key anomaly compared to other iron - based superconductors",
    "is the winning of superconductivity over antiferromagnetism in real space at moderate underdopings , even where the magnetic transition temperature is higher , suggesting that the generic behavior of a two - dimensional iron pnictide may be for the electronic or magnetic channels of the fermi - surface electrons to favor superconductivity .",
    "further , because the very weak co doping also appears to be remarkably homogeneous , nafe@xmath2co@xmath3as is an excellent system in which to seek evidence of unconventional phases arising purely due to intrinsic electronic correlations . for this we obtain additional information concerning the _",
