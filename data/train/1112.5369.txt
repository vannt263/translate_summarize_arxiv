    "the elastic electromagnetic form factors of the proton are important characteristics that describe its internal structure .",
    "more precisely , the electric @xmath6 and magnetic @xmath7 form factors describe the spatial distributions of the proton s charge and magnetization as functions of four - momentum transfer squared  @xmath8 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews ) . until recently these form factors were determined only by an analysis of differential cross section of the unpolarized elastic @xmath9  scattering .",
    "let us recall that the differential cross section @xmath10 for elastic @xmath9  scattering in the one - photon exchange approximation ( see the first diagram in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) is given by the rosenbluth formula  @xcite : @xmath11 \\frac{d \\sigma_\\text{mott}}{d \\omega},\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13^{-1}$ ] is the virtual photon polarization , @xmath14  is the electron scattering angle in the laboratory frame and @xmath15  is the mott differential cross section .",
    "it follows from this formula that the proton form factors can be determined by measuring the differential cross section at fixed momentum transfer  @xmath8 , but with different electron scattering angles and incident beam energies .    in the mid - nineties , it became possible to use another method to study the proton form factors , the polarization transfer method , which was originally proposed back in  1974  . in this method",
    "a polarization of the recoil proton in the process of elastic scattering of longitudinally polarized electrons on an unpolarized hydrogen target is measured .",
    "in such a case the ratio @xmath16 is directly proportional to the ratio of transverse and longitudinal polarizations of recoil protons .",
    "for the elastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "the first diagram corresponds to the one - photon exchange approximation .",
    "the box and crossed - box diagrams describe the two - photon exchange ( the blob represents possible intermediate states of the proton).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=14.0% ]   for the elastic electron - proton scattering .",

    "the box and crossed - box diagrams describe the two - photon exchange ( the blob represents possible intermediate states of the proton).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=14.0% ]    measurements performed at tjnaf with the polarization transfer method  @xcite gave the results that are in contradiction with the results obtained by the rosenbluth method .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the polarized data of tjnaf as well as several results of the rosenbluth measurements are shown .",
    "the latter include the global analysis by walker  @xcite and new accurate rosenbluth measurement  @xcite .",
    "the most probable cause of this discrepancy is the failure of the one - photon exchange approximation to precisely describe the results of unpolarized measurements .",
    "however , application of the two - photon exchange corrections ( see the diagrams in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) runs into difficulties : on the one hand , there are no reliable calculations and , on the other hand , there are no sufficiently accurate experimental data ( for review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the two - photon exchange effect can be measured experimentally by precisely comparing the @xmath17 and @xmath1 scattering  @xcite .",
    "it is possible because the interference between the one - photon exchange amplitude and the two - photon exchange amplitude occurs with opposite sign for electrons and positrons . in 2004 , it was proposed  @xcite to perform such measurement at the storage ring  @xcite in novosibirsk .",
    "here we report on the status of this experiment .",
    "it should be mentioned that there are also two similar experiments underway at desy ( olympus collaboration  @xcite ) and at tjnaf ( clas collaboration  @xcite ) .",
    "the experiment was divided into two runs with different kinematic parameters ( for details see table  [ tab ] ) .",
    "the first run ( with a beam energy of 1.6  gev ) was conducted in late 2009 .",
    "analysis of data obtained in this run is continuing .",
    "the preliminary results are presented here ( also see ref .",

    "the particles were detected in three angular ranges : large angles ( la ) , medium angles ( ma ) and small angles ( sa ) .",
    "scattering of @xmath23 at small angles was used only for luminosity monitoring ( this is possible because the two - photon exchange effect is negligible for this kinematic range ) . in the second run ,",
    "the particles are detected in two angular ranges : large angles ( la ) and medium angles ( ma ) .",
    "the latter range is used for luminosity monitoring .",
    "kinematic parameters for both runs are shown in table  [ tab ] .",
    "the hydrogen internal gas target is used , similar to that previously used in the experiments at  @xcite .",
    "the target is an open - ended storage cell , which has an elliptical cross - section @xmath24 and a length of 400  mm .",
    "high - purity hydrogen gas is directed into the center of the storage cell .",
    "the thickness of the target is about  @xmath25 .",
    "hydrogen is pumped from the vacuum chamber using cryogenic pumps .",
    "the detector ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) consists of two identical parts ( top and bottom ) arranged symmetrically with respect to the median plane of the storage ring .",
    "azimuthal angle acceptance of the detector is  @xmath26 . in the first run ,",
    "the particles were detected in three angular ranges ( la , ma and sa ) . in the la and ma ranges the detector has a tracking system ( drift and multi - wire proportional chambers ) , calorimeters ( csi and nai crystals ) and plastic scintillators used for event triggering and for time - of - flight measurements . as for the sa range , here we used the sandwich scintillators .    in the second run , we have a slightly different configuration of the detector , but it is similar to that described above .",
    "an important feature is that here we have the possibility to reconstruct the full kinematics for some of the events with emission of hard real photons",
    ". this will allow us to test our calculations for the first - order bremsstrahlung ( see the next section ) .",
    "we use the following cuts ( in various combinations for different ranges ) for the selection of elastic scattering events : correlation between the polar angles of  @xmath27/@xmath28 and  @xmath29 ; the same for the azimuthal angles ; correlation between the lepton scattering angle and the proton energy ; correlation between the lepton scattering angle and the lepton energy ; @xmath30@xmath31 analysis for the proton identification ; and time - of - flight analysis for the identification of low - energy protons .",
    "the main sources of background events are pion production processes and machine backgrounds .    to suppress systematic errors it is important to maintain the same experimental conditions during data taking with electron and positron beams .",
    "therefore , data collection with @xmath27 and  @xmath28 beams is alternated regularly .",
    "this allows us to suppress effects of slow drift in time of the target thickness , detection efficiency and some other parameters .",
    "a typical working cycle of the experiment consists of the following stages : storing of @xmath27/@xmath28 beam up to @xmath32  ma ; ramping beam energy ( from the injection energy of 0.35  gev to  1.6 or 1  gev ) ; switching on the internal gas target and then data taking ( as long as the beam current drops to @xmath33  ma ) ; and returning to the injection energy .",
    "the full cycle with two beams ( electron and positron ) takes @xmath34 minutes , from which the data taking occupies approximately 40  minutes .",
    "the average luminosity of the experiment is about @xmath35 .",
    "the beam current integral collected in the first run is  54  kc . in the second run",
    ", we plan to collect the beam current integral of @xmath36  kc .",
    "the main possible sources of systematic errors of the measurement are as follows : different beam positions for electrons and positrons ; unequal beam energy for electrons and positrons ; time instability of detection efficiency ; drift of the target thickness in time ; and uncertainty related to the radiative corrections .",
    "for the first run , the total systematic uncertainty is now estimated as  @xmath37 ( for both la and ma ranges ) .",
    "there are three sources of information on the beam position : beam position monitors ( electrostatic pick - ups ) ; movable beam scrapers ; and reconstruction of the event vertex position using the tracking system of the detector . as for the beam energy",
    ", it is measured regularly and with good accuracy ( about 50  kev ) during the data taking by applying the compton backscattering technique  @xcite .",
    "the essence of this technique is as follows .",
    "photons from a  @xmath38 laser are scattered in a head - on collision with the stored beam .",
    "the beam energy can be determined from the spectrum of the backscattered photons that are detected by a high - purity germanium detector .",
    "not only the two - photon exchange , but also other higher - order qed processes affect the elastic scattering cross section .",
    "these processes include internal bremsstrahlung of real photons ( see the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and the processes associated with virtual photons ( vacuum polarization and vertex corrections , see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "note that the external bremsstrahlung is neglected due to the small thickness of the target .",
    "an important fact is that the internal bremsstrahlung affects the measured ratio  @xmath0 ( because the interference between the lepton bremsstrahlung and the proton bremsstrahlung occurs with opposite sign for electrons and positrons ) .",
    "the bremsstrahlung process can easily lead to a difference of a few percent between the cross sections of @xmath2 and @xmath1 elastic scattering .",
    "it is therefore very important to carefully consider the radiative corrections due to bremsstrahlung .",
    "in addition , the radiative corrections due to bremsstrahlung depend on the detector geometry , its spatial and energy resolutions and the kinematic cuts used in event selection .",
    "accounting for all these factors is only possible with careful simulation of the detector . for this purpose , a new monte  carlo event generator  @xcite , called ( elastic scattering of electrons and positrons by protons ) , has been developed .",
    "the generated events ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are used for geant4 simulation of the detector response .",
    "we apply the exact calculation   for the first - order bremsstrahlung .",
    "the main features of this calculation are as follows .",
    "first , we do not use the peaking approximation or even the soft photon approximation .",
    "second , we consider both lepton bremsstrahlung and proton bremsstrahlung .",
    "third , in the proton line we use the full electromagnetic vertex operator  @xmath41 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the real photon emission .",
    "in addition , we apply the calculation   for the first - order bremsstrahlung with the delta - isobar @xmath42 excitation .",
    "we use this calculation as an estimate of the contribution of the first - order bremsstrahlung with the proton excitations in the intermediate state .",
    "a detailed description of these calculations and the esepp event generator will be published elsewhere .    as for the other processes ( vacuum polarization and vertex corrections )",
    ", we use the standard approach described in refs .  .",
    "multiple soft photon emission  @xcite is not taken into account , as the estimates show that it can be neglected under our experimental conditions .",
    "as usual , only the infrared divergent parts of the two - photon exchange amplitude and the proton vertex correction are taken into account .",
    "these terms exactly cancel with the corresponding infrared divergent terms from the bremsstrahlung process .",
    "preliminary results of the first run are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] in comparison with all available world data on the ratio @xmath0 ( in the range @xmath43 ) .",
    "it can be seen that our results have better accuracy than the data available . for the la range ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 )",
    "the result is @xmath46 , and for the ma range ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) the result is @xmath49 . here , the first error is statistical and the second is systematic .",
    "these results are preliminary because some minor corrections have not yet been made ( for example , corrections related to the variation of beam energy and position ) .",
    "note that before applying the radiative corrections , these values were @xmath50 for the la range and @xmath51 for the ma range .         the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] show the theoretical predictions for the ratio  @xmath0 due to the two - photon exchange  @xcite .",
    "these data were kindly provided by prof .",
    "blunden  @xcite .",
    "the solid and dashed lines correspond to the kinematics of the first and the second runs , respectively .",
    "if these predictions are correct , then the expected size of the two - photon exchange effect in the second run should be approximately the same as for the la range in the first run . at the same time , the elastic @xmath52 scattering cross sections are larger for the kinematics of the second run .    the second run of the experiment is underway , and we are not ready to present results yet .",
    "we plan to get results in two or three experimental points in the range @xmath53 with total errors of about  @xmath54 .",
    "we have described the status of the novosibirsk experiment on the precise comparison of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 elastic scattering cross sections .",
    "the results of our measurement are more accurate than the data currently available .",
    "the experimental data give the size of the two - photon exchange effect in elastic electron - proton scattering .",
    "this information is important to explain the recently observed discrepancy between new polarized measurements and old data on the proton electromagnetic form factors .",
    "special attention is given to the radiative corrections , in particular , to the first - order bremsstrahlung .",
    "we have developed the event generator , which is based on the accurate calculation of the first - order bremsstrahlung beyond the soft - photon approximation .",
