    "measurements of peculiar velocities with galaxies rely on distance indicators to subtract the hubble expansion , and have achieved notable success in probing peculiar velocities using galaxy surveys out to @xmath0mpc ( e.g. see review by strauss & willick , 1995 ) .",
    "however , individual galaxy distance indicator surveys are typically restricted to isolated parts of the sky , which should then be corrected for when reconstructing galaxy flow characteristics , such as the amplitude of the bulk flow on a given scale ( e.g. watkins et al . 2009 ) .",
    "snia surveys input highly accurately measured individual distances ( turnbull et al .",
    "2012 ) , but are sparse and require corrections for sky coverage effects ( rathaus et al .",
    "more critically , in all of such measurements the galaxy velocity is probed with respect to the frame of the hubble expansion and translated into the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) rest frame after assuming that the _ entire _ cmb dipole is of purely kinematic origin caused by the doppler effect due to the local motion of our galaxy , local group etc .",

    "the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ; sunyaev & zeldovich , 1972 ) measures directly the peculiar velocity of clusters with respect to the cmb and does not require subtracting the velocity due to the hubble expansion",
    ". therefore ksz offers an alternative method to probe peculiar velocity field at larger distances potentially inaccessible to galaxy distance indicator methodologies .",
    "its main disadvantage is that the temperature fluctuations due to the peculiar motion of individual clusters are much smaller than the cosmological cmb signal , foreground emissions , instrumental noise or the thermal sunyaev - zeldovich anisotropies ( tsz ; sunyaev & zeldovich , 1970 ) from the thermal motion of electrons in the potential well of clusters . as a result",
    ", the peculiar velocity of a single cluster has yet to be determined .",
    "kashlinsky & atrio - barandela ( 2000 , hereafter ka - b ) thus proposed a method to probe the bulk motion of clusters of galaxies collectively using all - sky cmb maps combined with an all - sky x - ray cluster catalog .",
    "they pointed out that one can construct a statistic , the dipole moment evaluated at cluster locations over a fixed aperture containing the entire x - ray emitting gas , which can probe the bulk flow down to cosmologically interesting levels for the _ wmap _ and _ planck _ instrumental configurations .",
    "the ka - b method requires filtering out the primary cmb component _ without removing the ksz signal _ , and isolating the tsz contribution to the measured dipole . for the former , in ka - b we proposed a variant of the wiener filter , designed to minimize the contribution from primary cmb with the known mean power spectrum , whereas the tsz component can be attenuated if in clusters the gas x - ray temperature , @xmath1 , decreases toward the outer parts as it was indeed found empirically ( atrio - barandela et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the ka - b method was first applied to the 3-yr _ wmap _ cmb data coupled with an extended cluster catalog where , surprisingly , a statistically significant dipole over the cluster apertures containing _ zero _ monopole was found for a volume of median / mean depth of @xmath2mpc ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 , hereafter kabke , kabke2 ) . within the statistical and systematic calibration uncertainties this corresponded to the cluster sample moving at @xmath3km / s in the direction of the cmb dipole .",
    "kabke termed this the  dark flow \" speculating that it may be reflective of the _ effective _ motion across the entire cosmological horizon .",
    "if true , this is equivalent to at least a part of the all - sky cmb dipole being of primordial origin , a possibility that requires an isocurvature component in the primordial density field ( matzner 1980 , turner 1991 , mersini - houghton & holman 2009 ) . using a further expanded cluster catalog and _ wmap _ 5-yr cmb maps kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2010 , hereafter kaeek ) showed that the cluster dipole correlated with cluster properties , increasing in amplitude for the most x - ray luminous and massive clusters , as expected from sz contributions ( the tsz contribution being small over the final apertures as evidenced by the zero monopole there ) .",
    "atrio - barandela et al . ( 2010 , hereafter akeke ) have developed - analytically and numerically - the formalism to understand the error budget of the ka - b method , which can and should be applied to any such measurement as a consistency check .",
    "kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2011 , hereafter kae11 ) have shown that the results can be probed with public cluster data which they have posted for interested investigators at www.kashlinsky.info/bulkflows/data_public .",
    "the methodology of the analysis , the results and their potential implications have been extensively reviewed in kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter kae12 ) .    motivated by the final _ wmap _ 9 yr and _ planck _ 1 yr data releases",
    "we have scrutinized our previous ",
    "dark flow \" measurements with the further developed methodology and present the results here .",
    "we do not address our interpretation of the signal here : throughout we refer as the  dark flow signal \" to the statistically significant dipole remaining at cluster positions and with an amplitude which correlates with x - ray cluster luminosity pointing , within the uncertainties , in the direction of the all - sky cmb dipole .",
    "wmap _ does not have the frequency coverage required to distinguish a ksz dipole from the dipole generated by a random distribution of the tsz anisotropy , we evaluated the final dipoles at apertures containing zero monopole . since the mean tsz monopole is an upper bound on the tsz generated dipole , this aperture guarantees that the measured dipole was not due to the tsz effect .",
    "importantly , planck has measured on both sides of the zero - tsz frequency at 217 ghz and has provided the appropriate data to test whether the dipole contains a significant tsz contribution . for this",
    "data we just require the aperture to be large enough for the errors integrate down and leave a statistically significant dipole .",
    "we will show that , at the same aperture , the _ planck_-based results are fully consistent with those of _",
    "wmap _ , providing a very important consistency check .",
    "the measured dipole turns out to be independent of frequency and is consistent with the cmb black body energy spectrum and therefore , can not be due to tsz or foreground residuals since those components vary with frequency .",
    "we find the same results as before with the _ wmap _ 9 yr data analysis , but given the lower noise levels of that dataset and the new methodology here we can isolate the signal better .",
    "we then apply the methodology to _ planck _ 1 yr data and we find full consistency with the _ wmap _ results .",
    "there appears a statistically significant `` dark flow '' signal at cluster locations with the dipole amplitude which correlates with cluster x - ray luminosity and the direction pointing within the uncertainties to the direction of the all - sky cmb dipole .",
    "if the measured signal with all its properties can arise from something other that ksz , we would welcome this discussion .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : for completeness we briefly revisit the methodology , the data processing pipeline and the error budget of the ka - b measurement . then in sec .",
    "3 we present the analysis of the _ wmap _ 9 yr data , which supports empirically the error budget estimations derived in sec . 2 and our previous measurements . sec .",
    "4 addresses our measurement of the dark flow signal with the _ planck _ 1 yr data .",
    "we find full consistency between the _ wmap _ and _ planck _ results , except that for the map at 30  ghz and in particular cluster configurations , that could be affected by low - level systematics , consistent with the effects of striping due to the _ planck _ observing strategy .",
    "the `` dark flow '' measured in _",
    "planck _ is significant at better than the 99% confidence level .",
    "when combined with the fact that the signal correlates with cluster x - ray luminosity and points in the direction of the all - sky cmb dipole , the significance of the existence of the primordial contribution to the cmb dipole , known as `` dark flow '' , is even larger . throughout this paper",
    "we use the x - ray cluster catalog compiled for the kaeek study .",
    "a more advanced and expanded catalog is now being worked on and upon its completion we will present the results from its application .",
    "a cluster in the direction @xmath4 , moving with a peculiar velocity @xmath5 , will generate a temperature anisotropy @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the projected electron density along the line of sight , @xmath8 the speed of light and @xmath9 is the cmb blackbody temperature .",
    "a sample of clusters randomly located in the sky moving with an average velocity @xmath10 will produce a temperature anisotropy @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the angle with respect to the apex of the motion . at the position of clusters , microwave temperature anisotropies have several components : primary cmb , tsz and ksz components , foreground residuals and instrument noise .",
    "ka - b estimated how these terms integrated down with many clusters concluding that at the resolution of _ wmap _ and _ planck _ channels the dominant contribution to the noise of the ksz measurement would be from primary cmb anisotropies .",
    "ka - b proposed to use the known statistical properties of the primary cmb to filter out this contribution and increase the signal - to - noise of the probed ksz term .",
    "the ka - b proposed filter minimizes the difference @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being the instrumental noise ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "akeke have shown analytically and numerically that it effectively removes the primary cmb signal down to the cosmic variance . in @xmath15-space",
    "the ka - b filter is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the actual realization of the radiation power spectrum in _ our sky _ that includes noise , tsz , ksz , foreground residuals , and primary cmb ; @xmath18 is the power spectrum of the @xmath19cdm model realization that best fits the data , and @xmath20 is the antenna beam .",
    "_ wmap _ and _ planck _ have measured the microwave sky at different frequencies with varying angular resolution .",
    "we implement our filter taking into account the specifics of each of the _ wmap _ differencing assembly ( da ) or the _ planck _ channels .",
    "our pipeline for measuring the dark flow signal works as follows :    1 .",
    "we start with foreground - cleaned all - sky microwave maps . 2 .",
    "the data of each channel are multiplied by the galactic and point source mask . to facilitate comparison with our previous results we chose the _ wmap _",
    "3 .   next , monopole , dipole , and quadrupole are subtracted from the regions outside the mask",
    ". then we compute the multipole expansion coefficients @xmath21 correcting for the mask .",
    "the @xmath21 coefficients are multiplied by the filter @xmath22 before transforming them back into real space to create the filtered map . since the quadrupole and octopole are aligned with the dipole the filter is set to zero for @xmath23 to avoid any cross - talk between those scales that could mimic a dipole .",
    "the monopole and dipole outside the mask are removed from the filtered maps .",
    "the dipoles are computed at the cluster positions using fixed aperture for all clusters for a given depth , x - ray luminosity cutoff configuration .    our first results , presented in atrio - barandela et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and kabke1,2 were obtained using different apertures .",
    "we estimated the size of the region that emitted 99% of the x - ray flux , @xmath24 , for each cluster and computed dipoles in units of @xmath24 .",
    "the results were found to be very similar to those using a fixed aperture zero monopole for all clusters so we present the results using fixed apertures where errors are simpler to compute and can be evaluated by analytic means providing multiple cross - checks ( akeke ) .    as indicated in the introduction , kaeek showed that when binned by cluster x - ray luminosity , the cluster dipole measured in filtered maps correlated with central tsz anisotropy in unfiltered maps , with larger amplitudes corresponding to the most x - ray luminous clusters , as expected from sz contributions . due to the inhomogeneous distribution of clusters on the sky ,",
    "the mean tsz anisotropy ( or monopole ) could generate a significant dipole and/or other higher order multipoles .",
    "it is important to demonstrate that the measured dipole was not due to the tsz effect .",
    "_ wmap _ operated in the rayleigh - jeans cmb regime and did not provide enough direct information to subtract the tsz contributions from the measured dipoles . to ensure that in _ wmap _ data the measured dipole was not dominated by the tsz monopole we used the fact that all tsz multipoles due to the inhomogeneous distribution of clusters on the sky , including the dipole , would be bounded from above by the monopole .",
    "then , in step [ 6 ] we repeated the measurement for different apertures and selected the dipole measured at the _ zero monopole _ aperture to ensure that the tsz component did not contribute to the measurement .",
    "this aperture is no longer necessary when using",
    "data , where the tsz vanishes at 217ghz and any dipole there will be free from tsz contributions .",
    "we compute errors numerically using the same configurations and apertures that were used to evaluate the dipole at the cluster positions in kaeek . in kae12",
    "we discussed four different methods to evaluate numerically the errors and showed their mutual consistency ( sec . 10.3 ) .",
    "our dipole is measured at cluster pixels so the error on this measurement is determined by the distribution of the random dipoles in the data away from the actual clusters .",
    "we evaluate these random dipoles by placing filled aperture discs at random positions in the sky with the same angular extent as was used to measure the dipole at the cluster location .",
    "we remove all pixels within 80 arcmin from the center of all known clusters to make sure that the randomly distributed discs do not overlap with them . by using the realization of the primary cmb as given by the actual sky to measure the dipole and its error we take into account the effect of all possible systematics existing in the filtered data , such as foreground residuals , inhomogeneous and correlated instrument noise , as well as any artifact that could have been introduced by our pipeline like mode coupling and power leakage between the galactic mask and the cosmological signal remaining in the filtered data . in atrio - barandela ( 2013 )",
    "we discussed the different biases and inefficiencies that exist between different types of simulations that can result on overestimating the errors .",
    "in akeke we developed an analytical insight to detail the different contributions to the error bars and their properties when the instrumental noise is gaussian - distributed and foreground residuals are negligible .",
    "more details are given in akeke and kae12 ( sec .",
    "10.3 ) , where it is shown that numerical simulations of the actual cmb sky give errors in excellent agreement with the analytical theory .",
    "this formalism clarifies the relation between the errors of the monopole and of the three dipole components and their scaling with the number of clusters ; it is briefly summarized below .",
    "the filtered maps have variance @xmath25 .",
    "while the filter erases a large fraction of the primary cmb anisotropy , _ it leaves a residual due to cosmic variance that is common to all frequencies_. the realization of the radiation power spectrum as seen from our location , @xmath17 , differs from the underlying power spectrum @xmath26 by a random variable of zero mean and ( cosmic ) variance @xmath27 ( abbott & wise 1984 ) .",
    "in addition , the instrument noise is also present with a power spectrum @xmath28 . neglecting foreground residuals in the foreground - cleaned maps",
    ", akeke have demonstrated that the variance of the filtered map is given by propagating the cosmic variance ( also , see sec 10.3.1 of kae12 for a more detailed derivation ) @xmath29= \\sigma_{cv , fil}^2+\\sigma_{{\\cal n},fil}^2(t_{obs } ) \\label{eq : sigma_fil}\\ ] ] this expression is valid in the limit of zero tsz contribution and so does not reflect the fact that the final errors will depend on the radius of the aperture chosen around each cluster , so they need to be computed numerically .",
    "an error - aperture dependence is to be expected since the residual cmb and noise have different spectra as shown in akeke ( see fig .",
    "1 ) ; the residual cosmological cmb signal dominated at @xmath30 while the noise dominated at @xmath31 . by taking larger apertures",
    "the instrument noise integrates down and the residual cmb dominates the error budget . for this reason the final errors on _ wmap _ and _ planck _ will be similar even if they have very different noise levels . for _ wmap",
    "_ we chose an aperture that guarantees that there are no contributions to the dipole due to the tsz effect . at this aperture errors",
    "integrate down and leave a statistically significant dipole .",
    "nevertheless , eq .  ( [ eq : sigma_fil ] ) is very instructive since it shows that the variance of the filtered maps depends mainly on two components : ( a ) the residual cmb not removed by the filter due to cosmic variance ( cv ) and ( b ) the noise that decreases with increasing time of observation @xmath32 .",
    "1 of akeke demonstrates empirically the high accuracy of the above expression .    by construction ,",
    "the filtered maps have no intrinsic monopole or dipole .",
    "since we measure these two moments from a small fraction of the sky , our limited sampling generates an error due to the ( random ) distribution of these quantities around their mean zero value .",
    "this error is proportional to the rms dispersion of the filtered map , the size of the fixed aperture around each cluster and the number of clusters @xmath33 of the catalog . for a fixed aperture ,",
    "the cosmic variance term of eq  ( [ eq : sigma_fil ] ) scales as @xmath34 while the noise term scales as @xmath35 , being @xmath36 the number of pixels within a fixed aperture around each cluster .",
    "the sampling variances of the monopole and three components of the dipole @xmath37 depend on how homogeneously clusters sample the sky .",
    "a direct calculation shows that the monopole ( @xmath38 ) and three dipole ( @xmath39 ) errors are : @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the clusters direction cosines .",
    "if clusters were homogeneously distributed in the sky then @xmath42 and the errors on the dipoles would be related to that on the monopole as expected : @xmath43 , since three quantities are evaluated from the same data as the monopole . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec:3.2 ] , this expression is only approximately true since , due to the galactic mask , the error on the x and y components of the dipole is slightly larger than that of the z - component ( see akeke , sec 10.3.2 and fig 10.7 of kae12 , for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the analytical formalism summarized in this section neglects the contribution of possible foreground residuals but _ they are already included in the numerically computed statistical uncertainties _ since , as mentioned above , we compute errors using the same realization of the sky than the data and , therefore , including foreground residuals as well as all other systematics .",
    "we find that eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_fil ] ) and ( [ eq : error ] ) agree with the errors found in simulations from the actual sky showing empirically that foreground contributions are small .",
    "the lower noise levels of _ planck _ as compared with _",
    "wmap _ as well as different and independent systematics , allow a second and in some ways independent measurement of the ksz signal , providing further test of our filtering scheme .",
    "the ka - b filter has been designed to remove the cosmological signal by minimizing the difference between the data and the instrumental noise , i.e. , the filter minimizes @xmath13 .",
    "the filter oscillates around zero , @xmath44 , where the noise is negligible and @xmath45 where the noise dominates .",
    "if the noise decreases , the filter will remove all signals down to the limit imposed by cosmic variance ( kabke2 ) . since cosmic variance decreases as @xmath46",
    ", lowering the noise implies that the filter will remove the signal at high @xmath15 s more effectively .",
    "then , whether the tsz and ksz signals survive or not , our filtering will depend on how these contributions are distributed in @xmath15-space .",
    "for instance , the average tsz anisotropy when evaluated at the cluster locations is a monopole and , in the absence of mask , filtering will distribute it preferentially to even multipoles while the bulk flow due to all the clusters is a dipole and it will be distributed preferentially to odd multipoles . in other words ,",
    "the filter depends on the instrument noise ( see sec  2.1 ) and maps with noise of different amplitude will give different filtered maps ; this will change the redistribution of the tsz and ksz components , intrinsic cmb and foreground residuals , changing the amplitude and direction of the measured dipole . therefore , due to the difference in noise amplitude and properties , it is important to compare the results obtained with _",
    "wmap _ and _ planck _ to isolate the effect of systematics .",
    "we first present the results of our analysis of the dark - flow signal in the final _ wmap _ 9 yr data . to facilitate the comparison with our earlier results , we use the kp0 mask to remove the galaxy and the x - ray cluster catalog assembled for the kaeek study .",
    "this catalog contains 980 clusters outside _ wmap _ kp0 mask , with redshifts @xmath47 and x - ray luminosities in the rosat @xmath48 band of @xmath49erg / s . of those ,",
    "598 have x - ray luminosities @xmath50erg / s .",
    "we consider four cumulative redshift bins , selecting clusters by redshift : @xmath51 . in each redshift bin",
    ", we define three independent cluster subsamples according to their luminosity .",
    "these subsamples are @xmath52 ( in the same units as before ) for clusters with @xmath53 and @xmath54 for all other bins .",
    "the number of clusters and other properties of each subsample are given in table  1 of kaaek .",
    "in total we only have 11 different bins since the bins @xmath55 and @xmath56 with @xmath57erg / s differ by two clusters and their results are almost identical .          in kabke , kaeek and kae11",
    "we have analyzed the subsequent data releases of _ wmap _ 3 , 5 and 7 yr data , respectively .",
    "we have consistently constructed the filter from the same data that we used to compute the dipoles . with each release ,",
    "the noise level in the map has decreased , changing the filter .",
    "motivated by the discussion in the sec .",
    "[ subsec : filter - noise ] we can now test the robustness of the detected dipole signal with respect to the noise level of the filter ; i.e. , we can test the effect of the noise in redistributing the signal in the @xmath15-space of the filtered maps and its effects on the measured dipole . for this purpose ,",
    "we have constructed four filters for each of the eight single frequency all - sky cmb maps using the data from the 3 , 5 , 7 and 9 yr releases . during these integrations",
    "the rms instrument noise has been reduced by a factor @xmath58 and so each subsequent filter would remove progressively a larger fraction of the intrinsic cmb signal .",
    "the four different filters were then applied to the _ wmap _ 9 yr data of the ultimate noise achieved with that instrument .",

    "[ fig : ak1 ] , where one can see also the differences in the maps of different resolution going from q at @xmath59 to w at @xmath60 .",
    "since the noise is largest at the w da s and lowest at q more structure survives in the former than in the latter filter .",
    "however , combining the four w da s decreases the instrument noise by a factor of 2 .",
    "the overall s / n of the kaeek measurement is driven by the most luminous x - ray clusters as should be if the dipole arises from the sz cluster components . in fig .",

    "nevertheless , the difference with the results at a fixed aperture , say 25 or 30arcmin , are negligible since the residual monopole is always small , proving that the dipole is not contaminated by the tsz monopole .",

    "the planck collaboration provides templates to correct foreground emission at different frequencies and this will be the approach we will use here .",
    "a joint analysis of iras and planck three highest frequency channels showed that dust varies strongly on small scales due to dust evolution , extinction and local effects , particularly in high - contrast molecular regions . to correct the thermal dust emission we need to take into account its great variability and to this purpose use the _ planck _ dust model that gives the three parameters that define the modified black - body emission law ( dust - grains temperature , emissivity index and optical depth ) at the reference frequency of 353  ghz @xcite .",

    "although we can not estimate the effect of these noise inhomogeneities on the data , since we compute error bars using the filtered maps used to compute the dipole , like in _ wmap _ , they will be accounted for in our error bar estimates .",
    "_ wmap _ and _ planck _ scanning strategies are very different , so comparison between both data sets is important to isolate systematics . to facilitate the comparison , we filter the cmb signal and compute the dipole at the cluster location following the same steps as in _",

    "compared with the _ wmap _ filters shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ak1 ] , the filters of the two lowest lfi frequencies are similar to those of _ wmap _ but the other filters are very different due to differences in resolution and instrument noise .",

    "like in _ wmap _ , error bars on the dipole are driven by the error on the monopole and are approximately given by eq .",

    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : planck_results1 ] show a remarkable consistency among themselves and with those of _ wmap _ 5yr data .",

    "only the theoretical model @xmath26 is common to all filters .",
    "the consistency of the measured dipoles shows that our results are neither generated by artifacts introduced by our pipeline nor are dominated by systematics present on the data .",
    "the spectral distribution confirms our earlier findings with wmap : the dipole can not be due to the tsz effect or from a systematic associated with foreground residuals in the data as the measured dipole remains constant at all frequencies except for the offset at 30  ghz , which is most stripe - dominated .",
    "the dipole is clearly different of what it would be if it was due to tsz effect as suggested by @xcite . in this case , the dipole had to be zero at 217  ghz and have the opposite sign at 353  ghz , none of which is observed .",

    "the statistical significance has been computed by generating @xmath120 random dipoles with zero mean and rms dispersion the uncertainty in each dipole component for each cluster configuration and finding the fraction of random dipoles with amplitude larger than the measured value .",
    "the statistical significance exceeds 99% in the three most significant bins , the three bins with the brightest clusters , @xmath121erg / s .",
    "first , notice that at 70 ghz monopoles are larger than those at 143ghz , but the ratio is smaller than @xmath122 , i.e. , it is smaller than the ratio of the tsz amplitude at 70ghz to 143ghz .",
    "the 70ghz channel has lower resolution ( see sec  4.2 ) and dilutes cluster anisotropies more than 143ghz .",
    "second , the largest monopoles and dipoles corresponds to the most luminous 130 clusters with @xmath123 but the highest significance corresponds to the 208 clusters with @xmath55 .",
    "the second bin has a larger number of clusters and the dipole components are measured with a slightly better signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this small difference results in great variations on the statistical significance since we are exploring the tail of the distribution .",
    "the dipoles measured at the different _ planck _ frequencies display remarkable consistency , except for 30  ghz , and exhibit a strong correlation with the tsz monopole .",
    "these results are consistent with the dipoles measured previously in _",
    "wmap_. in fig .",
    "[ fig : wmap59_planck ] we compare the three components of the dipole for the three x - ray luminosity bins of clusters with redshift @xmath124 measured in _ wmap _ 5 , 9yr and _ planck _ at 100ghz , represented by triangles ( red ) , diamonds ( blue ) and solid circles ( black ) , respectively . in the x - axis , the 5 yr data _",

    "[ fig : wmap_planck ] are not yet relevant , the systematic offset in the @xmath79-component of the dipole or the discrepant results of the 30  ghz channel could be the result of systematics present in the _ planck _ data .",
    "we have already noted in figs  [ fig : planck_maps ] and [ fig : stripes ] that foreground - cleaned _ planck _ nominal maps contain very strong non - gaussian features . even if stripes correspond to differences in the number of observations ( or weights ) in the data , they are not erased but are rather enhanced by filtering .",
    "the filter depends on the noise , @xmath128-features could introduce some effect , mostly in the 30  ghz map , the channel with the largest intrinsic noise of all the _ planck _ frequencies .",
    "there are other effects that could be more pernicious .",
    "the low weight stripes are often there because over most of the sky there are 2 distinct sets of observations 6 months apart while at the beginning or end of the period there is only one set of observations .",
    "this has several effects , first because there is only one set of data , there is a single correction for long term drifts so whatever effects are there one has fewer data sets to average over .",
    "this increases the systematic effects according to the number of data sets which is a small number .",
    "secondly there are fewer data to check these long term drifts against other data .",
    "finally in the middle of a data set one can interpolate , while at the end one must necessarily extrapolate which is intrinsically more uncertain .",
    "these effects lead to higher noise at low frequencies .",
    "the pattern of the _ planck _ observations puts the low temporal frequencies at low spatial frequencies . as can be noted from fig .",
    "11 of @xcite systematic effects have higher than proportional noise at low frequencies and this effect would be largest at 30  ghz , where the noise is higher , than at other channels and could be the underlying reason why the dipole has not been equally preserved by the filter than in wmap .",
    "as indicated in sec  [ sec4.3 ] , understanding the effect of stripes would require to analyze the time ordered data and goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our results differ markedly from an earlier analysis of _ planck _ data using the internal linear combination map ( @xcite , hereafter pir-13 ) , a foreground clean map similar to smica constructed to measure the ksz effect .",
    "the tsz contribution in their map was removed to less than a few percent of its original value .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "collaboration claim not to have found any detection of a bulk flow as measured in any comoving sphere extending to the maximum redshift covered by their cluster sample .",
    "in fact , they found a dipole for their full cluster sample ( see fig .",
    "10 of pir-13 ) similar to ours but overestimated their error bars , diluting the statistical significance of their measurement .",
    "the planck collaboration used two flawed methods to compute errors .",
    "1 ) they rotated the cluster template around the z - axis ; this method underestimates the error on the z - component and overestimates it in the x and y - components , given an overall increment on the error of modulus ( see atrio - barandela ( 2013 ) , table  1 and figs .  2 and 3 ) .",
    "2 ) they computed the errors measuring dipoles with the actual distribution of clusters over simulated cmb skies , but their simulations did not mimic the data accurately enough . in the real sky , filtering leaks power from high galactic latitude to the galactic plane . in their simulated maps",
    "the planck collaboration did not apply any galactic mask , preventing the power leakage to the plane of the galaxy . as a result ,",
    "their simulated maps contain higher power than the actual sky ( see atrio - barandela ( 2013 ) figs .  4 and 5 ) , again overestimating their errors by a similar amount than in their rotation method ( see atrio - barandela 2013 for a full discussion ) .",
    "in addition , they did not find a larger dipole for their 200 most massive clusters . while some differences may arise from the differences in cluster samples ,",
    "the lack of correlation between dipole and monopole is probably due ( a ) to their binning and ( b ) to having eliminated the tsz component from their map , a component which we have shown not to have an effect on the measured dipole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : planck_results1 ] ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : ak4 ] and [ fig : planck_results2 ] we have demonstrated that the largest dipole originates from clusters with @xmath121erg / s and @xmath123 . adding clusters with higher redshift in the same luminosity bin reduces both the monopole and dipole , consistent with clusters being more diluted by the antenna .",
    "if their subsample of massive clusters is , on average , at higher redshifts , then their dipole would be smaller than the values we have found . to verify the dipole - monopole correlation they ought to have measured the tsz from foreground clean maps at different frequencies , to check if their most massive clusters produced the largest tsz monopole or not .",
    "we have computed the dipole at the cluster locations using the same techniques for _ wmap _ and _ planck_. we find a `` dark flow '' signal which correlates with x - ray properties , and is therefore likely related to cluster gas , and not to the primary cmb , foregrounds or noise .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with our earlier findings and are consistent both in _ wmap _ 9 yr and in _ planck _ 1 yr . those instruments used different scanning strategies , which resulted in different systematics and , while small differences remain , the close agreement is reassuring of the real nature of the dipole signal .",
    "specifically we found that :    * the dipole at the zero monopole aperture remains at cluster positions at the same level as in kaeek .",
    "* the dipole at cluster positions correlates with the tsz monopole , a proxy for x - ray luminosity . *",
    "the signal is consistent among the different multi - year _ wmap _ integration filters and with all _ planck _ frequencies , except for a small , typically @xmath110 , offset at 30  ghz . *",

    "wmap _ is similar to that found in kaeek , and is larger for _ planck _ than for _ wmap_. * within the uncertainties the signal points in the direction of the all - sky cmb dipole . *",
    "if one accepts the ksz interpretation of the detected statistically significant signal the equivalent velocity is @xmath3km / s , within the systematic and statistical calibration uncertainties discussed by kashlinsky et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , kaeek and atrio - barandela et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .    while we deliberately avoid interpretation here , we note that the measurements are consistent with the  dark flow \" proposition ( kabke ) , namely the existence of a primordial cmb dipole of non - kinematic origin , which then presents itself as an effective motion across the entire cosmological horizon",
    ". no other alternative interpretation of the measured signal has been advanced although it would be of scientific interest . instead ,",
    "the debate concentrated along the lines of trying alternative filtering schemes , which may erase the signal ( atrio - barandela et al . 2012 ) . indeed , an all - sky filtering can not imprint a dipole exclusively at cluster positions , which would in addition correlate with cluster x - ray luminosity , but given the still limited significance of the measurement of about @xmath129 , other filtering schemes can reduce the measurement below being statistically significant ( see fig . 13 of @xcite , where such alternative filtering schemes start picking up the ksz signal at velocities exceeding 4,000 - 6,000 km / sec ) .",
    "if the `` dark flow '' corresponds to a large scale motion it is of interest to compare with peculiar velocities derived using other methods .",
    "first , @xcite have measured the aberration of the cmb temperature fluctuations due to our local motion , constraining the amplitude of large scale flows in the direction of the solar motion , i.e. , constraining the motion of the local group projected in that direction but not the full vector .",
    "velocity estimates relying on distance indicators are affected by their uncertainties .",
    "for instance , watkins & feldman ( 2014 ) argue that their previous results overestimated the flow due to their distances being underestimated by 10% .",
    "probes of the velocity field on scales @xmath130mpc depend on the value of the hubble constant and the current discrepancies between local measurements and the _ planck _ value makes these measurements even more uncertain .",
