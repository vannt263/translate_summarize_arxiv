    "the scalar - tensor theories ( for a complete review for applications in cosmology , see , e.g. , @xcite ) have been proposed based on the main idea which asserts that the gravitational coupling is time - dependent , an idea related to the large number hypothesis by dirac  @xcite .",
    "he suggested that the gravitational constant @xmath0 decreases with the age of the universe , an assumption that can be in agreement with a few consideration of geological facts  @xcite .",
    "then , the dirac s idea has been developed by other physicists by constructing new versions of the scalar - tensor theories in which the gravitational constant has been replaced by a scalar field  @xcite , and consequently it must satisfy a generalized conservation law proposed in the theory . in 1961 , the simplest version of the scalar tensor theories was proposed by brans and dicke primarily motivated by cosmology and the mach s principle  @xcite .    using different methods , exact cosmological solutions",
    "have been obtained for the isotropic flrw models , the anisotropic bianchi types i - ix and the related kantowski - sachs models by assuming various kinds of the ordinary matter in the context of the bd theory ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , it has been shown that by applying a specific reductional procedure for the conventional bd theory in @xmath1-dimensional space - time , a mbdt in @xmath2 dimensions is obtained  @xcite .",
    "the mbdt has four sets of field equations , in which two sets of them , regardless of the geometrical origin of the matter and scalar potential , are mathematically similar to those derived from the bd standard action with a scalar potential .",
    "one set of the mentioned mbdt field equations is the extended version of the conservation equation introduced in induced matter theory ( imt ) , see e.g. ,  @xcite . finally , the forth equation retrieved in mbdt has no analog in the conventional bd theory as well as in scalar tensor theories .    to gain an insight into the physical features of the mbdt and comparing the properties of its geometrically induced matter and scalar potential with the ordinary ones assumed in the context of the bd theory as well as with observational data ,",
    "several investigations have been presented by considering both the spatially flat flrw universe ( in four  @xcite and arbitrary  @xcite dimensions ) and the bianchi type i cosmology  @xcite .",
    "we should note that , up to our knowledge , the solutions of the non - flat flrw space - time have not been obtained in either the higher - dimensional bd theory or the mbdt scenario .",
    "moreover , the herein solutions associated to flat space are wider than the ones obtained in  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the induced scalar potential and matter in the mbdt lead us to an accelerating universe in late times ( as it will be seen in this work ) and we do not require to add a scalar potential by hand such as some phenomenological scenarios in the context of the db theory  @xcite .    the aim of this paper will be to employ the mbdt to reduce the five - dimensional flrw solutions ( for all values of the curvature ) on a suitably projected four - dimensional space time . we will show that the induced matter obeys the barotropic equation of state and consequently this geometrically originated matter can be examined for particular choices of well - know matter types in the universe .",
    "subsequently , the properties of obtained extended solutions will be analyzed and then they will be compared with the ones obtained from the four dimensional bd theory ( with or without a scalar potential ) as well as with observational data .",
    "we will further show that all the solutions can be considered as the generalized versions of the well - known solutions of the bd theory ( e.g. , the dehnen - obregon , nariai , ohanlon - tupper solutions ) in four dimensional space - time .    in this work",
    ", the expressions for physical quantities will be obtained neither by using the conformal time nor by defining other variables to explain the behavior of the scale factor and scalar field , but instead , we will discuss the behaviors from their corresponding direct physical expressions .",

    "we show that the induced matter obeys the barotropic equation of state and consequently it can play the role of either the ordinary matter or dark matter - dark energy in the universe . by assuming a few known values for the equation of state parameter",

    "moreover , a few classes of our solutions have no analog in comparison with those obtained by means of corresponding conventional setting .",
    "we should note that herein solutions still can be generalized by assuming an ordinary matter in the bulk and/or supposing that the bd scalar field and the components of the metric to be functions of the extra coordinate @xmath17 . * in order to obtain the herein solutions , we have not introduced conformal time and other variables different from the scale factor and the bd scalar field , see , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "* as our mbdt setting @xcite has been formulated in arbitrary dimensions , thus , it can be employed not only for obtaining the reduced solutions ( for a specified model ) in @xmath298-dimensions but also it can be examined for deriving the solutions in @xmath299-dimensions .",
    "this manner of studying lower dimensional gravity theories ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and references therein ) can be of interest in probing a relationship between such theories and the standard four dimensional standard bd theory , as well as introducing a procedure of producing exact solutions in @xmath299 dimensions that are , as might be expected , related to the vacuum @xmath298-dimensional solutions .",
    "subsequently , we can also investigate what happen for the behaviors of the physical quantities in the particular cases , especially , when the bd coupling parameter goes to infinity .",
