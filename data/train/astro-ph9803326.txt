    "understanding the status and evolution of dwarf galaxies is of crucial importance in current astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "they are important ingredients in common scenarios of galaxy formation , either as building blocks or as left - overs of the formation process ( silk 1987 ) .",
    "in addition , dwarf galaxies forming at redshift around and below 1 have been suggested to be responsible for the excess of faint blue galaxies seen in deep photometric surveys ( babul @xmath9 rees 1992 ; babul @xmath9 ferguson 1996 ) .",
    "dwarf galaxies come in three main classes : ( i ) dwarf spheroidals , which contain population  ii stars and have low surface brightness ( e.g. , wirth & gallagher 1984 ) ; ( ii ) dwarf irregulars , with various levels of star - formation activity and a high gas mass ( hunter & gallagher 1986 ) ; ( iii ) starbursting dwarfs , including blue compact dwarfs ( thuan 1991 ) , h  ii galaxies ( terlevich  1991 ) , and blue amorphous galaxies ( sandage & brucato 1979 ) . the boundary between dwarf and giant galaxies is usually taken to be around @xmath10 mag ( tammann 1994 ) .",
    "an intriguing property of dwarf galaxies is the pronounced dichotomy between the two main classes of dwarf spheroidals and dwarf irregulars : most dwarfs are either gas - poor spheroids or gas - rich disk - like systems , with very few transition objects ( van den bergh 1977 ) .",
    "the relationship between the two classes is still poorly understood : attempts to unify the complex zoo of dwarf galaxies have not been fully successful ( binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "some effort has been made to understand the interrelationship between individual classes in terms of an evolutionary sequence ( e.g. , gallagher , hunter , & tutukov 1984 ) .",
    "starbursting dwarfs can play a key role : a powerful starburst might strip a gas - rich dwarf irregular of its gas and transform it into a gas - poor dwarf - elliptical ( kormendy 1985 ; marlowe 1997 ) .",
    "understanding the star - formation histories in starbursting dwarf galaxies is a prerequisite for understanding evolutionary connections between different object classes ( e.g. , gallagher 1996 ) since during cosmologically brief periods of time their star formation increases dramatically .",
    "this has profound implications for the interstellar medium .",
    "stellar winds and supernovae inject energy and may cause a ` blow - out ' , initiating a galactic superwind ( heckman 1995 )",
    ". numerous examples of galactic superwinds are known from observations ( e.g. , heckman , armus , & miley 1990 ) and their cosmological implications have been discussed ( e.g. , de young & heckman 1994 ) .",
    "however , attempts to relate the superwind properties and the star - formation histories in individual galaxies are quite rare and do not go beyond a qualitative level ( heckman  1990 ; leitherer , robert , & drissen 1992 ) .",
    "yet establishing such a relation is crucial for theoretical models of the superwind hydrodynamics ( suchkov  1994 ; tenorio - tagle & muoz - tuon 1997 ) .",
    "ngc  1569 (= ugc  3056 = arp  210 = vii  zw  16 = iras  4260 + 6444 ) has been indicated by gallagher , hunter , @xmath9 tutukov ( 1984 ) as an outstanding object in their sample of active star forming galaxies .",
    "indeed , it is a prime candidate for a detailed study of the star - formation history in a starburst galaxy since at @xmath11  mpc it is the closest starburst galaxy known ( israel 1988a ) . adopting the literature reddening @xmath12 = 0.56 ( israel 1988a ) , photometry of individual stars is feasible with hst down to @xmath13 .",
    "this corresponds to stars with mass of about 3  m@xmath6  in their core - helium burning phase , and consequently to a look - back time of @xmath00.4  gyr ( e.g. , schaller  1992 ) .",
    "the properties of ngc  1569 are typical of a dwarf galaxy . with a distance modulus of @xmath14 = 26.71 ,",
    "its total absolute b magnitude is @xmath15 ( israel 1988a ) , which is intermediate between the two magellanic clouds .",
    "its total mass and hydrogen content are estimated @xmath16  m@xmath6  and @xmath17  m@xmath6 , respectively ( israel 1988a ) .",
    "numerous studies of the chemical composition exist .",
    "the published range of oxygen abundances is very narrow : @xmath18 ( hunter , gallagher , & rautenkranz 1982 ) , 8.37 ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ) , 8.26 ( devost , roy , & drissen 1997 ) , 8.29 ( gonzlez - delgado et al . 1997 ) , and 8.19 ( kobulnicky & skillman 1997 ; martin 1997 ) .",
    "searches for chemical composition gradients were done by devost et al . and",
    "kobulnicky & skillman .",
    "no significant evidence for chemical inhomogeneities was found .",
    "if [ o / fe ]  =  0.0 is assumed , the average metallicity of ngc  1569 is @xmath19  , with about 0.2  dex uncertainty .",
    "thus , ngc  1569 is a gas - rich system with smc - like composition in a relatively early stage of its chemical evolution .",
    "the most detailed study of the warm ( @xmath010@xmath20  k ) gas of ngc  1569 was done by waller ( 1991 ) , who found evidence for a link between the star - formation history and the morphology and kinematics of extended gas structures .",
    "the same connection is suggested by hot ( @xmath010@xmath21  k ) gas observed with the rosat and asca satellites ( heckman  1995 ; della ceca  1996 ) .",
    "the extended x - ray emission is consistent with a starburst driven galactic superwind which could in principle lead to a large - scale disruption of the interstellar medium .",
    "evidence for large numbers of supernovae was also found from the non - thermal radio spectrum ( israel 1988b ) .",
    "one of the most spectacular properties of ngc  1569 are its ` super star clusters ' .",
    "these high - density star clusters were first detected and discussed by arp & sandage ( 1985 ) and melnick & moles , & terlevich ( 1985 ) and later studied by oconnell , gallagher , & hunter ( 1994 ) , ho & filippenko ( 1996 ) , de  marchi  ( 1997 ) , and gonzlez - delgado  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the super star clusters reflect a recent starburst in which at least @xmath22  m@xmath6of gas was transformed into stars within about 1  pc .",
    "super star clusters are similar to young galactic globular clusters observed shortly after their formation ( meurer 1995 ) .",
    "pre - costar hst studies of the field population were done by oconnell ( 1994 ) and vallenari & bomans ( 1996 ) ( hereinafter vb ) . according to the latter authors , ngc",
    "1569 experienced a strong starburst until a few myr ago , when its activity subsided .",
    "the repaired hst offers the possibility of significant improvement over these previous studies .",
    "we have therefore embarked on an extensive spectroscopic and photometric hst study in an attempt to confront the observational data with the predictions of theoretical models , and derive detailed informations on the star formation ( sf ) history in ngc  1569 . in a first paper ( de marchi  1997 ) we discussed the photometry of the sscs , while in this paper we present the results for the resolved stars in the same field , which are interpreted in terms of the recent sf history via theoretical simulations .",
    "the data and their analysis are described in section  2 .",
    "the derived color - magnitude diagram and luminosity function are in section  3 .",
    "our theoretical models are described in section  4 .",
    "they are compared with the observations in section  5 . in section  6",
    "we discuss our results and their implications for the evolution of dwarf galaxies , and we present in section  7 our general conclusions .",
    "the observations of ngc1569 described in this paper were obtained with wfpc2 on board the hst on 1996 january 10 ( ut ) .",
    "ngc1569 was centered in the field of view of the planetary camera ( pc ) yielding an effective plate scale of @xmath23pixel@xmath7 and a @xmath24 field of view .",
    "the plate scale and field of view of the adjacent wide field chips ( wf ) are @xmath25pixel@xmath7 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "images were obtained in three broadband filters , f380w , f439w and f555w , whose photometric properties are similar  yet not identical  to the johnson @xmath27 filters , and are described in detail in the wfpc2 handbook ( biretta 1996 ) .",
    "since the photometric quality of the f380w images turned out to be poor , it was not possible to measure stars fainter than @xmath024  mag with photometric errors smaller than @xmath00.2  mag .",
    "we have then concentrated our analysis on the f439w and f555w data only , and used the f380w images to check for spurious detections ( see below ) .",
    "a set of 16 deep exposures was collected for each of these filters , all of duration 630 s in f439w and 450 s in f555w .",
    "images were taken at 4 different positions , dithered by a few pixel in order to improve the sampling of the final combined images , to recover faint stars with reliability , and to eliminate high frequency noise .",
    "the whole dataset has been processed using the standard stsci pipeline procedure .",
    "after correction for geometrical distortion , images taken with the same filter have been registered and combined to remove cosmic ray hits .",
    "total exposure times of the final combined images are @xmath010,000  s and @xmath07200  s in f439w and f555w , respectively . for each filter ,",
    "a set of short exposures was also obtained to provide photometric measurements of stars which would saturate in the deep images .",
    "exposures of 20 s , 40 s , and 60 s duration were obtained for the f555w , f439w , and f380w filters , respectively , at two different pointings and are described in de  marchi  ( 1997 ) .",
    "many bright star clusters and several thousand stars are clearly visible in the deep wf+pc images .",
    "the automated star detection routine daofind was applied to the data , by setting the detection threshold at @xmath28 above the local background level .",
    "we carefully examined by eye each individual object detected by daofind and discarded saturated stars , a number of features ( psf tendrils , noise spikes , etc . )",
    "that daofind had misinterpreted as stars , as well as a dozen extended objects ( star clusters ) whose full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) exceeded that of typical stellar objects in pc frames ( fwhm @xmath29pixel ) by a factor of two or more .    in this way",
    ", a total of @xmath07000 unsaturated stars were detected in the field covered by the pc .",
    "the severe crowding of our images , particularly towards the center of the galaxy , led us to prefer the use of the psf - fitting daophot photometry package over the simpler , but more limited , aperture photometry techniques .",
    "a sample psf was built by using three relatively isolated and moderately bright stars (  @xmath2  @xmath2  21.5 ) located on opposite sides with respect to the body of the galaxy .",
    "instrumental magnitudes measured in this way were converted into the wfpc2 synthetic system vegamag as indicated in holtzman  ( 1995 ) .",
    "interested readers are referred to that paper for further details on the characteristics of the wfpc2 photometric system . in this paper ,  and",
    "refer to the wfpc2 synthetic system .",
    "although these magnitudes are very similar to johnson @xmath30 and @xmath31 magnitudes , no attempt has been made to convert our magnitudes into the standard johnson system .",
    "the main source of uncertainty in our photometry is crowding , particularly in the central regions of ngc1569 , where the average star - to - star distance is on the order of @xmath04  pixels . the photometric error estimated by daophot ( ) , and",
    "confirmed by artificial star tests ( see below ) , is smaller than @xmath32mag in both bands down to  @xmath2  @xmath2  24 , and it grows to @xmath00.3  mag at magnitude 26 in both bands .",
    "the behavior of the photometric error with magnitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma ] .",
    "we carried out a series of artificial star tests in order to estimate the fraction of stars lost to crowding as a function of their brightness .",
    "we ran 10 trials in each of the two filters , by adding each time a number of artificial stars not exceeding @xmath33 of the total number of objects in the frame , to avoid overcrowding .",
    "the magnitudes of the artificial stars were distributed according to the empirical luminosity function .",
    "recursive daofind runs , with the same parameters as in the reduction of the scientific data , allowed us to assess the fraction of added stars that were recovered and the magnitudes at which these objects were detected . since the artificial star routine ( addstar ) places objects at random over the area of the frame , these tests provide an average value of the photometric incompleteness in our images .",
    "artificial star tests were run on both filter frames , but the f439w image , being less deep , in practice defines the overall completeness limit .",
    "all artificial stars not recovered in the f555w frames were also missing in the f439w ones .",
    "this is partly due to the intrinsic color of the stars , and partly to the lower efficiency of the instrumental setup ( wfpc2 + f439w ) in the bluer band .",
    "since the assumed color distribution of the artificial stars follows the mean locus observed in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , the incompleteness factors derived in the two filters are not independent and , as such , the overall incompleteness fraction is set by the larger of the two values at each magnitude .    for each artificially added star we compared the input magnitude with",
    "that at which the star was recovered , and found no systematic difference .",
    "in addition , the standard deviation of the recovered values is in excellent agreement with the @xmath34 uncertainty of the photometric reduction at any magnitude level .",
    "our simulations show that at  @xmath2  25.0 on average about 30% of the artificial stars added to the pc chip are not detected by the automated routine , but this number goes down to only 8% at  @xmath2  23.5 . at magnitude levels",
    "brighter than  @xmath2  23 all artificial stars are detected , except when they fall on top of one of the bright super star clusters .",
    "our photometry is , therefore , @xmath0100% complete for  @xmath35  23 .",
    "table  [ tab - compl ] shows the completeness factors as a function of the f439w magnitude , as determined by the artificial star tests .",
    "these are the values adopted in our theoretical simulations .",
    "the artificial star experiments provide us with a statistical estimate of the number of stars lost to crowding .",
    "there is , however , another issue that must be considered when comparing the observations with theoretical simulations : blending affects the derived magnitude of detected objects .",
    "the extent to which the images of two stars can merge with each other , thereby resembling a single object with photometric properties different from those of the parent stars , is a function of their angular separation and of their magnitude difference .",
    "if the projected angular distance between two stars is smaller than the psf - fwhm , they will be detected as a single object by the photometric routine , and the number of stars lost because of this is included in the incompleteness factors . concerning the photometric error , we select objects with @xmath35 0.1mag and take 0.1mag as an estimate for the photometric accuracy of the data .",
    "thus , we are essentially interested in those cases in which the uncertainty introduced by blending on the determined magnitudes is larger than this value .",
    "this occurs when the blended stars differ in magnitude by less than @xmath02  mag .",
    "our tests show , however , that even in this case the sharp psf of the pc camera considerably limits the effects of blending , in spite of the high density of stellar objects in our frames .",
    "the results of the artificial star experiments , as well as statistical considerations , indicate that the probability of blending for a pair of stars differing less than 2mag in flux amounts to @xmath36 for objects brighter than  @xmath2  25 .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that blending introduces a large photometric uncertainty .",
    "blending of objects with a large magnitude difference is much more frequent . in this case , the fainter component is virtually lost with a small effect on the brighter one , and this is accounted for in the simulations by correcting for photometric error and incompleteness .",
    "two of the wf frames have also been reduced , the third having been discarded because of the presence of a highly saturated star .",
    "we found @xmath01000 objects with @xmath35 0.2mag in both the f555w and f439w filters .",
    "since the general characteristics of the stellar distributions in the cmds derived for the wf and for the pc frames are very similar , we proceeded with a quantitative analysis only for the cmd derived from the pc frames .",
    "[ fig - cmdo ] shows the cmd in the hst f439w and f555w bands resulting from the analysis of the region of ngc  1569 contained in the pc field of view . as discussed by de marchi  ( 1997 )",
    ", this region contains three super star clusters ( sscs ) , two of which form a close pair which is barely resolved .",
    "only integrated photometry is feasible for the sscs , which are not resolved into stars .",
    "the resulting @xmath37 and @xmath38 colors are indicative of young ages , but is not possible to date the clusters precisely .",
    "the diagram in panel a ) shows the 2809 objects measured in both the f555w and f439w bands with a photometric error  @xmath35  0.2 , while the diagram in panel b ) shows the subsample of 801 objects with  @xmath35  0.1 . by comparing the two panels it is apparent that the major features of the galaxy stellar population are well delineated in both cases .",
    "clearly , the diagram with the tighter selection criterion contains a lower number of stars because it reaches a brighter magnitude limit , and because it rejects most of the objects with extreme colors .    in the cmd shown in panel",
    "a ) there are some very blue objects , populating the bottom left corner .",
    "taking into account the average extinction affecting our field , objects appearing with (    )  @xmath3  0.5 have intrinsic colors bluer than @xmath2  1 .",
    "however , neither galactic nor extragalactic objects can have colors that blue : both white dwarfs with magnitudes in the relevant range , and the bluest qsos have intrinsic @xmath39 .",
    "we have thus examined in detail all the 72 objects with ( )  @xmath40 and photometric error @xmath35 0.2mag in both bands .",
    "they are all concentrated in the region of the pc field dominated by the main body of ngc  1569 , suggesting that these extremely blue objects originate from phenomena associated with the galaxy ( either physical or spurious ) , and not from background or foreground effects . a detailed examination in all of the three photometric bands revealed that most of these objects are spurious detections , due to noise peaks falling on the wings of stellar images , or to the blend of 2 stars .",
    "when selecting only the objects with errors @xmath35 0.1mag no point source with extremely blue color is found . since the shape and position of the bulk of the blue plume and of the red tail",
    "look unaffected by the selection criterion , we will adopt the diagram in panel b ) as reference observational cmd for the stellar population in the field of ngc  1569 .",
    "the general morphology of the cmd of ngc  1569 is similar to that of local group irregulars observed from the ground ( see , e.g. , freedman 1988 ; tosi  1991 , hereinafter tgmf ; greggio  1993 , hereinafter gmtf ; marconi  1995 , hereafter mtgf ; gallart , aparicio , @xmath9 vlchez 1996b ) , with a quite scattered distribution and a prominent concentration of stars in the blue plume .",
    "the cmd shows a smaller fraction of red stars , but this is mostly due to the selection effect of the magnitude limit for object detection in the f439w frame .",
    "indeed , the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 diagram of ngc  1569 obtained vb shows a significant population of red ( mostly intermediate age ) stars .",
    "the median color of the blue plume ( )  @xmath2  0.45 is quite red as a consequence of high foreground extinction . by correcting this color for the average foreground reddening @xmath43 as estimated from uv observations by israel ( 1988a ) , an intrinsic ( )",
    "@xmath44  =  0.1 is derived .",
    "this is equal to or slightly redder than the median @xmath45 color of the blue plumes in other nearby irregulars ( see , e.g. , mtgf and gallart  1996b for ngc 6822 ; tgmf for sextans b ; bresolin  1993 and gmtf for ngc 3109 ) .",
    "however , since gonzlez - delgado  ( 1997 ) have derived @xmath46 for the super star clusters in ngc  1569 ( using uv , optical and near - ir spectra ) , it may well be that this galaxy is affected by internal differential reddening .",
    "thus , the intrinsic colors of the blue plume stars could be bluer than the previous estimate .    given the low galactic latitude @xmath47  =  + 11@xmath48 of ngc  1569 , the observed cmd is likely to be populated by a significant number of foreground stars .",
    "despite our original request , the time allocated on hst was not sufficient to take exposures of adjacent fields and measure directly the galaxy contamination .",
    "since the cmd derived from the wf images looks very similar to that derived from the pc frames , the galaxy extends substantially over the wf frames , which can not then be safely used to discriminate between members and foreground / background objects .",
    "however , using ground based observations , vb derive a very low density of external field objects in the direction of ngc  1569 .",
    "thus our cmd should be almost unaffected by foreground / background contamination .",
    "the full dots in fig .",
    "[ fig - fl ] represent the luminosity function ( lf ) of the 801 selected stars of ngc  1569 , whereas the open circles correspond to the stars with 0  @xmath1  ( )  @xmath1  0.5 , which in the following will be referred to as the _ reference blue plume_. this subsample has been selected simply for the purpose of comparing our results with those relative to other galaxies and/or other authors , and does not represent either the whole blue plume or the pure main sequence ( ms ) stars .    in the past ,",
    "the lf of the blue plume was usually adopted for estimating the mass function , under the assumption that it is essentially populated by ms stars .",
    "however , as already noticed for other irregulars ( e.g. , freedman 1988 ; tgmf and gmtf ; gallart  1996b ) , the comparison of the observational cmd with theoretical stellar models demonstrates that the blue plume is populated also by a significant fraction of stars at the hot edge of the blue loop evolutionary phase .",
    "this represents a serious problem for authors deriving the initial mass function ( imf ) from the luminosity functions of the blue plume assuming it contained only ms stars .",
    "the ms  post - ms blend is apparent also in the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 diagrams described by vb . as discussed there and in the next section , it is virtually impossible to discriminate ms from post - ms stars at the brightest magnitudes , where the morphology of the theoretical evolutionary tracks of massive stars in the cmd leads to the merging of the blue edges of the loops into the region populated by ms stars .",
    "our ( ) selected _ reference blue plume _ is therefore just a compromise between the requirement of removing as much as possible the evolved stars and the need of keeping the brightest ms objects .",
    "the slopes of the lfs are usually derived with least squares linear fitting to their complete portions . however , as shown in gmtf and mtgf , the large statistical fluctuations due to the small number of sampled stars , especially at the brightest magnitudes , may significantly alter the results of a method requiring data binning . to overcome this problem ,",
    "we have applied a maximum likelihood fitting to evaluate the slope of the lf in the _ reference blue plume_. down to  =  23 , where our sample is complete ( see previous section ) , the slope turns out to be @xmath49 log @xmath50 .",
    "this value is higher than @xmath51 derived by vb , a result of the different methods : for instance , a linear fit gives a flatter slope of @xmath52 for our data set .",
    "furthermore , the fit of vb is not restricted to the data portion where completeness is reached .",
    "our slope @xmath53 is consistent with the average @xmath54 derived by freedman ( 1985 ) and hoessel ( 1986 ) from a large sample of irregulars .",
    "it appears , however , slightly steeper than the slopes derived by us in a homogeneous way ( see tgmf ; gmtf ; mtgf ) for four nearby dwarf irregulars , whose average value is @xmath55 .",
    "the observed cmd and the ( total ) lf described in the previous section have been compared to corresponding theoretical simulations , based on stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "this method has proven to be a powerful tool to investigate the star formation history of galaxies with young stellar populations ( see tosi 1994 ; greggio 1994 ) .",
    "synthetic cmds are constructed via monte  carlo extractions of ( mass , age ) pairs , according to a prescribed imf and a star - formation rate ( sfr ) law .",
    "the extracted object is placed on the theoretical h ",
    "r diagram ( hrd ) by interpolating on evolutionary tracks , and its luminosity and effective temperature are converted into magnitudes using tables for bolometric corrections and colors . a photometric error and incompleteness test ,",
    "both as measured on the observational frames , is finally applied , and the synthetic star is placed on the cmd .",
    "once the number of objects populating the synthetic cmd equals that of the observed one , the procedure is stopped , yielding the quantitative level of the sfr consistent with the observational data , for the prescribed imf and shape of the sf law .",
    "this procedure automatically accounts for the stochastic nature of the sf process , small number statistics , photometric errors , and incompleteness factors affecting the real data .",
    "in addition , it easily allows us to explore the effects of using different sets of stellar tracks .",
    "we have considered several sets of stellar tracks ( table  [ tab - mod ] ) in order to compare their effect on the derived sf history , and to check their adequacy in reproducing the main features of the observed cmd .",
    "the interpolation algorithm was carefully chosen to reproduce the main characteristics of the evolutionary sequences . due to numerical effects ,",
    "the short lived , post - ms phases may be underrepresented in the monte  carlo simulations .",
    "thus , the tracks have been trimmed in subphases , and for each extracted object the evolutionary subphase is first determined .",
    "interpolation between adjacent tracks is then performed within the appropriate subphase .",
    "this procedure ensures that the main features of the synthetic diagrams , ( e.g. , the blue - to - red ratio , the ratio between the ms and post - ms objects , the number of w - r stars , etc . )",
    "are consistent with the adopted set of tracks .",
    "the luminosity and effective temperature of the synthetic objects are converted into magnitudes and colors by interpolating on tables constructed from the collection of model atmospheres by lejeune , cuisinier , @xmath9 buser ( 1997 ) , which cover ( although non - uniformly ) the effective temperature and gravity ranges : 2000  k  @xmath35  @xmath35  50,000  k , 1.02  @xmath35  log  @xmath56  @xmath35  5.5 , and are characterized by several values of the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) , with solar elemental ratios .",
    "it should be noticed here that the tracks used for the simulations do not reach very low gravities , or temperatures lower than @xmath03600  k. therefore , the model atmospheres used for our synthetic diagrams are essentially those of kurucz ( 1992 ) . the sets at metallicities [ fe / h ]  =  0.5 and [ fe / h ]  =  1 have been selected for our application .    the conversion tables have been prepared as follows . for each model atmosphere in the grid ,",

    "the reddening is varied , within the observational estimate , in such a way that the average color of the synthetic blue plume agrees with the observations .",

    "this is motivated by the fact that the overall appearence of the cmd is sensitive to the morphology of the blue loops , which in turn critically depends on z ( ritossa 1996 ) .",
    "we have also explored the difference in the derived interpretation when adopting the padova set of tracks at z = 0.004 .",

    "the adopted imf exponent is @xmath70 ( in these units the salpeter s exponent is 2.35 ) .",

    "the synthetic blue plume extends up to too bright magnitudes and the bright portion of the lf is overpopulated over a wide magnitude range .",
    "these characteristics appear in all the simulations with this sets because they are related to the shape of the tracks on the cmd .",
    "infact , due to the relatively short color extension of the blue loops of models with mass around 5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - cmdth008 ] for the @xmath71 set ) , the faint portion of the blue plume has to be mainly populated by ms stars .",
    "this is a consequence of the photometric incompleteness in the f439w frames , which depletes the number of evolved stars when their colors are too red .",
    "thus , with these tracks a large number of massive stars is required , whose post - ms progeny shows up as bright evolved supergiants . in the specific case of the @xmath67  =  0.008 tracks , at magnitudes brighter than  @xmath2  21.5",
    "we find post - ms objects with masses between 15 and 25  m@xmath6 , which are the evolved progeny of fainter ms objects populating the blue plume in the range  @xmath2  25    22.5 .",

    "the cmds in fig .",

    "the excess objects are still present , yet shifted to intermediate and red colors . for @xmath67  =  0.004 , the adoption of a high mass loss rate would only affect the evolution of the most massive stars ( @xmath72  m@xmath6  ) , spanning a mass range which is almost not populated in our cmd .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - cmdth001 ] , the loops for the geneva tracks with @xmath67  =  0.001 extend to very blue colors , and a substantial fraction of the faint blue plume can be populated by relatively low mass stars in their core helium burning phase .",

    "this apparent discrepancy would be even more amplified for the larger distance .    while none of these arguments by itself provides convincing evidence for or against one or the other distance , taken together they all point toward the shorter distance .",
    "however , a larger distance would imply younger ages for the stars in our observed cmd , as well as larger levels of the recent sfr . to test the effect of the uncertainty in the distance to ngc  1569 we have computed simulations assuming a distance of 4 mpc .",

    "the simulations assume a still ongoing sf ( bottom panel ) and a recent stop , at 5 myr ( top panel ) , and again the slope of the imf has been chosen to minimize the number of massive stars .",
    "it can be noticed that , even adopting a large distance , a stop in the recent sf activity is preferred , not to overpopulate the bright end of the lf . the level of the sfr in these simulations is higher by a factor of @xmath0 2.8 with respect to what derived with the shorter distance .",
    "in the previous section we have shown that the geneva tracks with metallicities @xmath67  =  0.008 and 0.004 do not allow us to reproduce the main features of the observed cmd and lf , regardless of the adopted combination of imf and sfr .",
    "on the contrary , we find a fair agreement between the simulations and the data when adopting either the geneva tracks with @xmath67  =  0.001 , or the padova tracks with @xmath67  =  0.004 , the latter value being consistent with the metallicity derived observationally .",
    "these results , however , are mostly based on the shape of the blue loops , which are intrinsically uncertain . therefore , we can neither conclude that there is an indication for a lower metallicity in this galaxy , nor that the input parameters used in the padova tracks are to be preferred to those in the geneva tracks , as our analysis does not allow us to constrain the shape of the tracks down to this level of detail .",
    "rather , we maintain that both sets of tracks have the combination of input physics and metallicity parameter that yields a good representation of our data .",

    "\\ii ) during the last 0.10.15  gyr the sfr has been approximately constant",
    ". if quiescent periods have occurred , they did not last longer than @xmath010  myr .",
    "\\iii ) the best agreement is generally reached with imf slopes steeper than salpeter s , but the latter would not be inconsistent with the data .",
    "\\iv ) the average sfr in our field is approximately 3 , 1 , and 0.5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  for imf slopes of 3 , 2.6 , and 2.35 , respectively .",
    "these values refer to stars with masses ranging from 0.1 to 120 m@xmath6 but it should be emphasized that our data only constrain the star formation of objects more massive than @xmath04.5  m@xmath6 . the dependence of these derived values on the adopted set of tracks , reddening and shape of the sf law is found to be small .",
    "\\v ) assuming that the minimum mass for a type ii sn explosion is 8 m@xmath6 the derived sfr implies that in the last 0.1  gyr in our region about @xmath82 type ii events have occurred , for an imf slope ranging from 3 to 2.35 .",
    "it may seem that enhancing the recent sfr while steepening the imf would lead to the same result , and to some extent this is true : enhancing the recent sf would populate the cmd with young , and therefore massive , stars , thereby counterbalancing the effect of a steepening of the imf ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - synth2fl ] and fig .",
    "[ fig - synth3fl ] ) .",
    "however , we find that acceptable solutions have parameters in a relatively small range . in other words , when the shape of the sfr is radically different from the one giving a fair solution , it is difficult to obtain acceptable simulations by varying the imf slope ( and vice versa ) . indeed",
    ", the two parameters do not act in precisely the same way , as strengthening the recent sf with respect to the past enhances the population along the younger isochrones by a constant factor .",
    "conversely , varying the slope of the imf affects the distribution of stars along all the isochrones .",
    "thus , for example , when the imf slope is too flat , the lf of the synthetic population is so skewed towards the bright end that only very complicated sf histories may fit the data . as can be seen from figs .",
    "[ fig - cmdth008 ] and [ fig - cmdth001 ] , the shape of the tracks , and therefore of the isochrones as well , is such that in a given magnitude bin we find stars of different generations and different masses , so that it is not possible to disentangle the effects of sfr and imf .",
    "the number of stars falling within suitably chosen boxes in the cmd ( e.g. , bertelli  1992 ) may allow this task .",
    "however , it is very hard to define these suitable boxes in this case , due to the shape of the tracks for massive models in the observed cmd and to the photometric errors .",
    "this cautionary note applies in particular to the splitting of the population of the blue plume into the ms and post - ms contributions . for these reasons we need theoretical simulations , rather than isochrone superposition , to interpret the data",
    "moreover , as shown by our experiments , the shape of the blue loops heavily affects the synthetic cmd and lf so that the final solution depends on the adopted set of tracks .",
    "the flexibility of the simulation code allows us to easily explore this parameter space as well .",
    "it is also worth noting that the sf stop that we infer in the field of ngc  1569 is not particularly sensitive to the adopted upper mass cut off for the imf .",
    "for example , when the mass distribution is truncated at @xmath040  m@xmath6 the synthetic diagrams obtained with an ongoing sf are still overpopulated at the brightest magnitudes . indeed , lowering the mass cut off does not appreciably alter neither the slope of the lf , nor the overall ratio between the objects populating the fainter and brighter portions of the lf .",
    "conversely , when stopping the sf activity a few myr ago , the whole ms population is reduced with respect to the evolved one .",
    "our quoted values for the sfr refer to a single - slope imf with stars distributed from 0.1 to 120  m@xmath6 , and their dependence on the lower mass cut - off is of course very high .",
    "for example , the mass in stars within 0.1 and 1  m@xmath6  is @xmath00.55 , 0.75 , and 0.9 of the total for @xmath73 , 2.6 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , these values depend on the imf slope at the low mass end . in a recent study by gould , bahcall , @xmath9 flynn ( 1997 ) ,",
    "the imf for m dwarfs in the galactic disk can be fitted by a two - slopes imf , with a break at @xmath83  m@xmath6 and with a slope @xmath84 ( in our usual units ) in the low mass range . when adopting these prescriptions for the low mass end of the imf , and varying the slope of the mass distribution only over the range @xmath85 m@xmath6  , our average sfrs become @xmath00.8 , 0.5 , and 0.3  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  for slopes of 3 , 2.6 , and 2.35 , respectively .",
    "the only previous study primarily dedicated to the resolved stellar population in the field of ngc  1569 is that by vb . by using pre - refurbishment wfpc images ,",
    "these authors derive the cmd in the f555w and f785lp filters , roughly equivalent to the @xmath31 and @xmath41 bands .",
    "the method used for the interpretation of the data relies , like ours , on simulations of cmds based on evolutionary tracks , but without including the effect of photometric errors and incompleteness .",
    "an additional difference concerns the use of the lf as a tool to discriminate between possible models .",
    "vb conclude that ngc  1569 experienced a global burst of sf from 0.1  gyr to 4  myr ago , and that a previous episode of sf had taken place in the galaxy , at a substantially lower rate .",
    "our observations are not deep enough in the f439w band to detect the agb stars that reveal this older episode in the @xmath41 vs @xmath42 diagram . as for the recent sf history ,",
    "our results are roughly consistent with their finding .",
    "we prefer an earlier stop of the sf activity , since , when adopting an sf rate ongoing up to 4 myr ago , the synthetic lf tends to be overpopulated at the bright end , especially for the padova tracks with z=0.004 , which is the same set adopted by vb .",
    "vb could not establish quantitatively this effect without the comparison of the theoretical and observed lfs .",
    "in addition , we believe that the photometric incompleteness prevents the determination of the epoch at which the burst started , since stars older than 0.15@xmath50.1 gyr would go mostly or totally undetected in our images .",
    "finally , the level of the sfr of the recent burst that we derive using the same set of tracks and imf is consistent with theirs , judging from the estimate of the recent snii activity .",
    "to summarize , our results are in general agreement with vb , but we believe that our conclusions are more robust , due to both the superior quality of the refurbished hst data , and to the method employed for the interpretation .",
    "ngc  1569 has been suggested to be in a post - starburst phase ( israel 1988a ) .",
    "the definition of the starburst and the post - starburst phase is a matter of choice .",
    "here we define the starburst phase as being characterized by ongoing sf . with this definition",
    "the field population of ngc  1569 clearly is in a post - starburst phase since we find that the cmd requires no sf activity over the last few myr .    on the other hand , in the same region",
    "there are many hii regions and three sscs , whose age is likely to be younger than 10  myr ( gonzlez - delgado  1997 ) .",
    "therefore the stellar population in ngc  1569 is made of two components : the resolved stars with ages older than @xmath0 10  myr , and the stars in the sscs , which formed more recently .",
    "the resolved stellar component is in a post - starburst stage , while the most recent star formation is taking place in the sscs .",
    "this finding may suggest a picture of discrete sf events mainly generating sscs , which dissolve to create the field stellar population in a certain time interval .",
    "the @xmath010 myr quiescence period would correspond to a characteristic time step of the discrete sf activity .",
    "on the other hand , the compactness of the sscs suggests that they are gravitationally bound systems , and that they are true young globular clusters ( ho @xmath9 filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , the age of the brightest component of ssc - a has been estimated to be as old as 8  myr ( gonzlez - delgado  1997 ) , and still presents a half - light radius of @xmath01.6  pc ( de marchi  1997 ) . therefore the field population is likely to be the relic of a major episode of sf which involved the whole observed region , and which ended several  myr ago .",
    "the sf activity in the field is most likely responsible for the outflow of the interstellar medium analyzed by waller ( 1991 ) , who derived a kinematic age of 10 to 60  myr for the h@xmath77 filaments around ngc  1569 .",
    "this sf activity , however , has not depleted the gas reservoir , and more recent sf is currently occurring in the hii regions and in the sscs .",
    "this may suggest that only the densest regions are able to collapse to form stars following the burst of sf and its consequent energy input in the ism .",
    "the sfr in dwarf irregulars has been found to be characterized by long activity periods , separated by short interburst phases ( _ gasping sf _ , e.g. , tosi 1994 ) . in this respect ,",
    "the field stellar population in ngc  1569 exhibits similar properties , with a sf occurring at an approximately constant level over @xmath00.15  gyr , with quiescence periods shorter than @xmath010  myr .",
    "a quantitative comparison is instructive . among the different possible ways in which the strength of the star formation activity can be characterized , we consider the sfr per unit surface ( see hunter",
    "@xmath9 gallagher 1986 ) .    at a distance of 2.2 mpc ,",
    "the observed pc field surveys an area of approximately 0.14  kpc@xmath86 , so that our derived recent sf rates are about 20 , 7 , and 4  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  kpc@xmath87 , for imf slopes of 3 , 2.6 , and 2.35 , respectively ( again having extrapolated the imf down to 0.1  m@xmath6 ) .",
    "it is worth recalling that the typical sfr quoted for the solar neighborhood ( e.g. timmes , woosley , @xmath9 weaver 1995 ) is @xmath01000 times lower than this value .",
    "the comparison of the sfr in ngc  1569 with those derived for other dwarf irregulars is not straightforward since there is a non - trivial dependence on the method used to measure the sfr .",
    "even when considering the sfr derived from the analysis of the cmd via theoretical simulations , there may be systematic differences due to the adopted set of stellar tracks ( greggio 1994 ) . finally , the sfr depends on the adopted imf , both on the slope and on the mass cut - offs , the latter being not always clearly specified in the literature .    with this caveat in mind ,",
    "the recent sfr derived via theoretical simulations for dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group range from approximately @xmath88  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  kpc@xmath87 to @xmath89  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  kpc@xmath87 ( mtgf ; tolstoy 1996 ; gallart  1996a ) .",
    "when allowing for the uncertainties introduced by the different methods used , we can conclude that the recent sfr in ngc  1569 is @xmath0 100 times larger than in the most active local dwarf irregular .",
    "ngc  1569 fully deserves its classification as a ( post)-starburst galaxy , as opposed to normal , star - forming galaxies .",
    "could it be that strong sf bursts took place in dwarf irregulars in the past ? the chemical properties , and the gas content of the most active of them are not consistent with the extrapolation of the currently observed activity over a long time .",
    "chemical evolution models show that several bursts of sf may have occurred in these galaxies , but separated by long quiescence periods .",
    "strong bursts of sf could perhaps be accommodated but the duty cycle of this activity has to be low ( matteucci @xmath9 tosi 1985 ; pilyugin 1994 ; marconi , matteucci , @xmath9 tosi 1994 ) .",
    "more direct information on the past sf activity occurred in dwarf irregulars has been derived for some local group objects by analyzing the stellar population along the giant branches ( gallart  1996a ; aparicio , gallart , @xmath9 bertelli 1997a , b ) .",
    "although the sfrs derived in this way are less detailed and reliable than those deduced from the analysis of the ms and core he - burning stars , there is no hint that these galaxies experienced a much stronger sfr in the past than recently . on the other hand , the analysis of the giant branches does not permit a fair time resolution , and the past activity in these galaxies could also have been characterized by recurrent strong bursts , whose average rate is reflected by the bright portion of the cmd .    the cmd derived by vb exhibits a well populated agb , which definitely argues for previous sf in ngc  1569 .",
    "vb concluded that a sf episode took place at a significantly lower rate than the most recent one between 1.5 and 0.15  gyr ago .",
    "however , the values of these parameters are uncertain due to observational and theoretical limitations .",
    "nevertheless , the mere presence of agb stars gives evidence for a previous sf activity at intermediate ages .",
    "ages as old as @xmath010 gyr can be probed only with nicmos observations looking for the presence of stars at the tip of the first red giant branch in the infrared .    in the meantime ,",
    "indirect information on the past sf history can be derived from chemical evolution arguments .",
    "a recent determination of the oxygen , nitrogen and helium abundances in the interstellar medium of ngc  1569 was done by kobulnicky & skillman ( 1997 ) . comparing their values to the predictions of chemical evolution models for bursting dwarfs (",
    "marconi , matteucci , @xmath9 tosi 1994 ) we find that several bursts of sf may have happened in this galaxy , provided that strong galactic winds have occurred .",
    "the products of snii explosions should be preferentially lost in these winds , thus keeping the overall metallicity low .",
    "to summarize , the comparison of the sf history in ngc  1569 and that of dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group is inconclusive .",
    "while the general characteristics of the sf appear very similar , the level of the current sfr in ngc  1569 seems significantly larger than that of the dwarf irregulars in the local group over their whole lifetime .",
    "this suggests that ngc  1569 is distinctively more active than the local group dwarf irregulars .",
    "an evolutionary link between dwarf spheroidals and dwarf irregulars has been suggested several times ( e.g. , kormendy 1985 ; binggeli 1994 ) .",
    "strong bursts of sf are known to have occurred in dwarf spheroidals in the past ( e.g. , smecker - hane et al .",
    "unfortunately , to our knowledge a quantitative determination of the level and duration of these bursts has not yet been attempted .",
    "the evidence that ngc  1569 is currently experiencing a galactic outflow seems well documented , an effect which would turn the galaxy into an inconspicuous , perhaps forever fading object . on the other hand ,",
    "the ultimate fate of the expanding gas is rather uncertain , due to the complications of hydrodynamic modelling . a stronger case could perhaps be made by comparing the sfr in the bursts which occurred in the dwarf spheroidals , to what we measure for ngc  1569 .",
    "we now consider the possible relevance of galaxies like ngc  1569 to the interpretation of faint galaxy counts . to do this ,",
    "we first discuss the possible evolutionary path for the sfr in this galaxy .",
    "the direct census of the stellar population in ngc  1569 suggests that a strong burst of sf has occurred at a rate of @xmath00.5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7 , with a duration of @xmath00.15  gyr .",
    "this level of the sfr can not have been sustained over a long period of time .",
    "the total mass of the galaxy as estimated by israel ( 1988a ) is @xmath03.3  @xmath90  m@xmath6 . considering a sfr of 0.5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  as representative of the whole galaxy ( i.e. neglecting the activity in the regions external to our pc field , and considering a turn - over in the imf at the low mass end ) it only takes @xmath00.7  gyr to cycle the entire mass into stars .",
    "the gas exhaustion timescale is longer than this because of the mass return from stellar winds and supernovae .",
    "however , this corresponds to a small correction since 1  gyr after its birth a single age stellar population has returned only @xmath00.2 of its total mass ( for a salpeter imf ) .",
    "thus it seems very unlikely that such a high sfr could have been supported throughout a lifetime of several gyr , even allowing for the occurrence of galactic winds in the past , which would imply a larger initial mass .",
    "furthermore , the metallicity resulting from such extreme activity would inevitably be much larger than derived from the spectra of hii regions .",
    "though the above estimate for the gas exhaustion timescale is sensitive to the adopted lower mass cut - off , the metal production depends on the mass range that we directly observe .",
    "we thus suggest that , in spite of the rather constant sfr characterizing the more recent epochs , the average past sfr in ngc  1569 should have been much lower , perhaps with short intense bursts coupled with long quiescence periods .    considering the energy input from the recent burst of sf , vb suggest that at least part of the gas currently present in ngc  1569 will be lost from the galaxy .",
    "we confirm this expectation , since our snii rate is consistent with what found by vb .",
    "however , the burst giving birth to the stars in our observed field did not completely exhaust the gas reservoir , since the sscs and hii regions are younger than the field .",
    "it could be that , while the burst of sf was able to initiate a general outflow of the ism , the highest density clumps succeeded in collapsing to form stars , possibly stimulated by the sn explosions .",
    "the ultimate fate of the outflowing gas depends on several uncertain factors , including dissipation .",
    "in addition , hydrodynamic models for bursting dwarfs suggest that , once the energy input from stellar winds and supernovae has ceased , the interstellar medium in the outer disk of the galaxy falls back to the center , where it could power a successive burst of sf ( dercole @xmath9 brighenti 1998 ) .    to summarize , the recent burst could be the strongest sf episode in this galaxy over its entire lifetime , though the future evolution is rather uncertain . among the various models proposed in the literature to explain the excess population of faint blue galaxies , we consider those by gronwall @xmath9 koo ( 1995 ) and babul @xmath9 rees ( 1992 ) . in the model proposed by gronwall @xmath9 koo ( 1995 )",
    ", the blue galaxy population does not evolve .",
    "the luminosity evolution of ngc  1569 is likely to be characterized by on and off phases , corresponding to the recurrent bursts , with long interburst periods .",
    "therefore , if ngc  1569 were a typical object in the class of galaxies mostly contributing to the excess blue objects , a constant luminosity evolution of the population could be accomplished only with an appropriate number evolution of the galaxies of this kind  not a very attractive scenario .",
    "in other words , it seems unlikely that ngc  1569 represents the local counterpart of the galaxies mostly contributing to the faint blue counts in the gronwall @xmath9 koo ( 1995 ) model .    according to babul @xmath9 rees ( 1992 ) , the excess blue objects are bursting dwarf galaxies ( at redshifts close to @xmath01 ) which , after the burst , become gas - free because of sn explosions .",
    "later evolution is bound to passive fading .",
    "thus , ngc  1569 can not be regarded as a possible descendant of the bursting dwarfs , since it is bursting now .",
    "still , its properties may be relevant to the babul @xmath9 rees model . in a quantitative study of this models , babul @xmath9 ferguson ( 1996 )",
    "show that the current constraints on the faint galaxy population can be met if the sfr in the bursting dwarfs is large , so that the object is bright enough to contribute to the counts at the appropriate redshift .",
    "our derived sfr for the most recent burst in ngc  1569 seems close to the rate of @xmath01  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  required by their model .",
    "however , babul @xmath9 ferguson adopt a burst duration of 10  myr , one order of magnitude lower than what found here for ngc  1569 .",
    "the success of their model depends on the combination of the duration of the burst , efficiency of star formation , and on the decay rate of the dwarf galaxy formation probability .",
    "it is likely that longer burst durations can be accommodated when varying the other parameters . the model by babul @xmath9 ferguson also requires substantial dimming of the bursting dwarfs after the major burst .",
    "this is needed in order to avoid an excess of objects at brighter magnitudes , where the counts are dominated by the evolution of bigger galaxies . as emphasized before",
    ", we do not know if ngc  1569 will definitely lose its gas .",
    "the fact that ngc  1569 has experienced at least one previous burst and that the most recent one has had a relatively long duration , raises doubts on this hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , the case of ngc  1569 demonstrates that dwarf galaxies are capable to sustain bursts of sf of the magnitude required by this model .",
    "in this paper we have presented hst wfpc2 f555w and f439w photometry of resolved stars in the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc  1569 .",
    "about 2800 stars were measured with photometric error smaller than = 0.2mag out of a total of @xmath07000 objects detected .",
    "the corresponding cmd extends down to ,  @xmath2  26 , and is complete for  @xmath3  23 .",
    "it samples stars more massive than @xmath04  m@xmath6 allowing us to derive the sf history over the last 0.15  gyr .",
    "the interpretation of the data has been performed via theoretical simulations , based on stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "we have considered several sets of stellar tracks from the geneva and padova groups , and were able to reach a satisfactory representation of the data adopting either the geneva tracks with @xmath67  =  0.001 , or the padova tracks with @xmath67  =  0.004 .",
    "since the applicability of these tracks is related to the shape of the blue loops , which is sensitive to details in the input parameters used in the computations , we consider it premature to dismiss alternative sets of evolutionary tracks .",
    "the two sets provide a similar picture of the recent sf history in the field of ngc  1569 .",
    "the galaxy has experienced a general burst of sf , of duration @xmath91  gyr , at an approximately constant rate . the burst seems to have stopped @xmath05    10  myr ago but sf continues in the hii regions and in the sscs .",
    "if this general burst consists of successive episodes , these must have occurred at a similar rate , and be separated by short quiescent periods .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior looks similar to that inferred for dwarf irregulars in the local group .",
    "quantitatively , though , the level of the sfr in this recent burst in ngc  1569 is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher .",
    "we find that the salpeter imf is consistent with the observed cmd and lf , but our best simulations are characterized by slightly steeper slopes ( 2.6  3 ) .",
    "this seems to disagree with observations of other starbursts which generally indicate a salpeter slope ( leitherer 1997 ) .",
    "the present study , however , refers to the field population of stars less massive than @xmath030  m@xmath6 , whereas most starburst imfs are derived for the nuclear burst and for dense ob clusters in the mass range above @xmath020  m@xmath6 . since most of the sf activity in the ngc  1569 field has subsided about 7  ",
    "10  myr ago , we have no direct information on the imf of those stars with lifetimes less than this value .",
    "the corresponding minimum masses are around 30  m@xmath6 .",
    "the field - star imf in our galaxy and in the magellanic clouds is steeper ( biased against massive stars ) than the cluster imf ( massey , johnson , @xmath9 degioia - eastwood 1995a ; massey  1995b ) , with the cluster value being close to salpeter . this could be due to a richness effect , where the most massive stars are not observed simply because of their small expected numbers .",
    "ngc  1569 may be another case where the most massive stars with masses above @xmath030  m@xmath6  are preferentially formed in clusters , but we emphasize the different mass range sampled by our and that of lmc / smc studies .",
    "our preferred imf is quite similar to that derived for field stars of comparable mass in our galaxy .",
    "this is in agreement with the notion of a virtually constant imf , at least as far as the shape is concerned , and does not support the expectations of flatter slopes in starbursting regions ( e.g. , padoan , nordlund , @xmath9 jones 1997 ) , or in low metallicity environments , as sometimes invoked to better reproduce the properties of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , vazdekis  1996 ) .    in the past",
    ", the sf in ngc  1569 is likely to have proceeded at a substantially lower average rate than in the recent burst .",
    "this follows from the estimate of the gas exhaustion timescale , and from the relatively low metallicity of the ism in this galaxy .",
    "this leaves the possibilities of either an approximately constant sfr , or short strong bursts , with long interburst periods .",
    "detailed chemical evolution models are needed to explore quantitatively the possible evolutionary paths for ngc  1569 , and this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "the recent burst of sf is certainly not the first episode in ngc  1569 ( see also vb ) but may be the last .",
    "the velocity field of the ionized gas ( tomita , ohta , @xmath9 saito 1994 ) and energetics arguments support this possibility ( heckman  1995 ) .",
    "if this was the case , in the future ngc  1569 may turn into a dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "in addition , its luminosity evolution would be characterized by passive fading , which seems required by the babul @xmath9 ferguson ( 1996 ) bursting dwarfs model to explain the excess faint galaxy counts .",
    "however , it is also possible that the outflowing gas falls back onto the galaxy , triggering a successive burst of sf , an option which has to be explored with the computation of detailed hydrodynamic modelling for bursting dwarf galaxies ( dercole @xmath9 brighenti 1998 ) . in spite of these uncertainties",
    ", our results shows that dwarf galaxies are capable of sustaining bursts of sf at large enough rates to be relevant for the interpretation of the faint galaxy counts .",

    "<S> we present wfpc2hst photometry of the resolved stellar population in the post - starburst galaxy ngc  1569 . </S>",
    "<S> the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) derived in the f439w and f555w photometric bands contains @xmath02800 stars with photometric error @xmath1 0.2 mag down to ,  @xmath2  26 , and is complete for  @xmath3  23 . adopting the literature distance modulus and reddening , our cmd samples stars more massive than @xmath04  , allowing us to study the star formation ( sf ) history over the last @xmath00.15  gyr . </S>",
    "<S> the data are interpreted using theoretical simulations based on stellar evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> the synthetic diagrams include photometric errors and incompleteness factors . </S>",
    "<S> testing various sets of tracks , we find that the ability of the models to reproduce the observed features in the cmd is strictly related to the shape of the blue loops of the sequences with masses around 5  . </S>",
    "<S> the field of ngc  1569 has experienced a global burst of star formation of duration @xmath40.1  gyr , ending @xmath0 5@xmath510  myr ago . during the burst , the sf rate was approximately constant , and , if quiescent periods occurred , they lasted less than @xmath010  myr </S>",
    "<S> . the level of the sf rate was very high : for a single - slope initial mass function ( imf ) ranging from 0.1 to 120  we find values of 3 , 1 , and 0.5  m@xmath6  yr@xmath7  for @xmath8 , 2.6 , and 2.35 ( salpeter ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when scaled for the surveyed area , these rates are approximately 100 times larger than found in the most active dwarf irregulars in the local group . </S>",
    "<S> the data are consistent with a salpeter imf , though our best models indicate slightly steeper exponents . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications of our results in the general context of the evolution of dwarf galaxies .    </S>"
