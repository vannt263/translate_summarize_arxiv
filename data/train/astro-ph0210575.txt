    "much of our knowledge of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) comes from the rest - frame uv line absorption that it imprints on the spectra of background quasars : the forest of neutral hydrogen and associated metal lines such as and .",
    "the forest thins out at low redshift , and cosmological simulations predict that the continuing process of structure formation heats a substantial fraction of intergalactic gas to temperatures where it produces little hydrogen absorption , and where the dominant ionization stages of heavier elements have absorption transitions at x - ray wavelengths rather than uv .",
    "one of the few prospects for detecting this low density , shock - heated gas is via the `` x - ray forest '' of absorption lines it should produce in quasar spectra ( hellsten , gnedin , & miralda - escud(1998 ) ) .",
    "here we discuss x - ray forest searches , with focus on absorption towards h1821 + 643 ( @xmath0 ) using a high resolution ( @xmath1 ) spectrum obtained with the x - ray observatory .",
    "the baryon density implied by big bang nucleosynthesis and the estimated primordial deuterium abundance , @xmath2 ( burles & tytler ( 1998 ) ; here @xmath3 ) , exceeds the density of baryons in known stars and x - ray emitting gas by roughly an order of magnitude ( fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "the lower density regime of the `` warm - hot intergalactic medium '' ( whim , cen & ostriker , 1999 ) could constitute a major fraction of the `` missing '' low redshift baryons .",
    "hydrodynamic cosmological simulations predict that 30 - 50% of the baryons reside in this phase at @xmath4 ( dav ' e et al .",
    "hst and fuse detections of ( @xmath5 ) absorption lines towards h1821 + 643 ( tripp , savage , & jenkins 2000 , hereafter tsj ) offer a tantalizing hint of this baryon reservoir .",
    "adopting conservative assumptions of [ o / h]@xmath6 and an ionization fraction @xmath7()=0.2 ( which is close to the maximum in photo- or collisional ionization ) , tsj conclude that the gas associated with these weak absorbers accounts for @xmath8 of the cosmic baryon budget , comparable in total mass to all other known low redshift components combined . for most reasonable assumptions about the physical conditions of this absorbing gas , the dominant ionization state should be or , and @xmath9 lower than 0.2 , implying a substantially higher baryon fraction .",
    "we chose h1821 + 643 for our x - ray forest search for two reasons : ( 1 ) it is one of the brightest x - ray quasars at moderate redshift , and ( 2 ) it has been studied carefully for intervening absorption ( tsj ; ( oegerle 2000 ) .",
    "the latter is important because even long observations with gratings were expected yield a low s / n spectrum , and searching at redshifts with known absorption allows one to adopt a lower effective threshold for significant detection , greatly increasing the odds of success .",
    "furthermore , detections of or upper limits on x - ray absorption provide new constraints on the physical conditions of the six known absorbers ( z1=0.26659 , z2=0.24531 , z3=0.22637 , z4=0.22497 , z5=0.21326 , z6=0.12137 ) .",
    "[ h ]    we observed h1821 + 643 with letg for 480 ksec ; the 2128    spectrum is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the spectrum was fitted with a smooth continuum plus a gaussian absorption line at the @xmath1021.602  wavelength for each of the redshifts z1 to z6 ( see mathur 2002 for details of observations and analysis ) .",
    "this fit yielded @xmath11 detections at z2 and z6 . applying",
    "the same procedure at the expected wavelengths of the @xmath1218.969  line yielded a significant detection only at z6 .",
    "the existence of features with @xmath13 significance at several wavelengths predicted _ a priori _ on the basis of absorption suggests that we have indeed detected x - ray forest lines from highly ionized oxygen in these systems .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the coincidence between observed features and known absorption redshifts is , in fact , just a coincidence .",
    "we calculate the probability of a coincidence , in the absence of a true physical correlation , to be about 5% .",
    "since this probability is not extremely small , we will be cautious in interpreting our observations , considering both the possibility that we have true detections of several x - ray forest absorbers and the possibility that we have only upper limits .",
    "we convert the observed line equivalent widths to corresponding column densities for each ion species assuming optically thin gas .",
    "the z2 system has an inferred column density of @xmath14 , while the z6 system has @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "upper limits for undetected systems are typically @xmath17 for and @xmath18 for . using these",
    ", we estimate @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the six observed systems and compare them to theoretical predictions ( chan 2002 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows tracks in @xmath20 vs.@xmath19 plane for the intergalactic medium for a range of temperatures and densities . the dot - dashed line is for pure collisional ionization",
    "while the other contours include photoionization by the uv and the soft x - ray background , and correspond to overdensities @xmath21 , 10 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the right panel shows lines of constant temperature . comparing the two panels",
    "shows that @xmath19 is primarily a diagnostic of gas temperature , while @xmath20 constrains the gas density for a given value of @xmath19 .",
    "this behavior reflects the competing roles of photoionization and collisional ionization , with the latter being more important for higher temperatures , higher densities , and lower ionization states .",
    "the filled points with @xmath24 error crosses mark the two detected systems at z2 and z6 . for the remaining four systems , we plot arrows showing the @xmath24 upper limits on @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "[ h ]    = 5.0truein    at the @xmath25 level , our measurements and limits have a number of interesting implications .",
    "first , there are variations in the ion ratios from system to system .",
    "second , the upper limits on the undetected systems restrict their locations in the temperature - density plane .",
    "for example , the z4 system must have @xmath26 , and if it is close to this temperature , it must have @xmath27 .",
    "third , the overdensities implied by the best - fit line parameters of the detected systems at z2 and z6 are significantly below the values @xmath28 corresponding to virialized systems . in physical terms , the co - existence of detectable amounts of , , and requires that photoionization play a central role in determining the abundance ratios , which is possible only if the density is fairly low .",
    "the major uncertainty in determining the contribution of systems to the cosmic baryon budget is @xmath9 , and this quantity is what we can estimate using the x - ray observations .",
    "we treat all of our @xmath29 detections as real , but where we have only @xmath24 measurements or upper limits , we conservatively assume the lowest and column densities consistent with the physical expectation that @xmath30 .",
    "this calculation yields @xmath31^{-1 } \\rangle = 32 \\pm 9 $ ] , substantially higher than the conservative value of 5.0 that tsj assumed .",
    "combined with the tsj result , this ratio implies @xmath32 for @xmath33=-1 $ ] , which substantially exceeds the contribution of any other known low redshift baryon component , representing an appreciable fraction of the baryons predicted by bbn .",
    "the implications discussed above are only as compelling as the detections themselves .",
    "constraints on the physical conditions of the igm at the @xmath29 level are rather weak . the conclusion that @xmath34 , with a tighter upper limit for stronger absorbers , holds robustly , but stronger physical constraints on the systems at the @xmath29 level require higher s / n than our present observations afford .",
    "however , we can still derive an upper limit on @xmath31^{-1 } \\rangle$ ] , even if the @xmath29 lines are not real detections .",
    "the result is @xmath35^{-1 } \\rangle < 60 $ ] at @xmath24 and @xmath35^{-1 } \\rangle < 79 $ ] at @xmath29 . in combination with the tsj numbers ,",
    "even the @xmath24 upper limit is consistent with @xmath36 .",
    "if we had obtained null results for all of the systems , then the upper limit on @xmath37 would have come out well below @xmath38 .",
    "our results show that definitive measurements of x - ray forest absorption are extraordinarily difficult .",
    "fang ( these proceedings ) claim a 4.5@xmath39 detection of an intervening system towards pks 2155 - 304 .",
    "however , xmm - newton observations ( rasmussen , these proceedings ) rule out any detection at the reported significance . thus , even with the great technological advance of and xmm - newton , we do not have fully convincing evidence yet of any x - ray forest absorption beyond the local group . mapping",
    "the warm - hot igm appears to be _ constellation - x _ science . a 500 ksec observation with _ constellation - x",
    "_ grating will result in an equivalent width limit of 2.8 m  ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "if the grating resolution is further improved to r=3000 , then x - ray lines as weak as 1.4m  will be detected .",
    "the higher resolution is important because there may not be tall trees in the x - ray forest .",
    "the tantalizing but still ambiguous hints of x - ray forest absorption in current observations are frustrating to live with for half a decade or more before the launch of _ constellation - x_. in the mean time there are a couple of options for progress .",
    "we can wait for a blazar to flare up ; a good s / n spectrum may then be possible in a reasonable time .",
    "however , the number of x - ray forest systems with column densities large enough to be observable with gratings is expected to be only about one per unit redshift .",
    "this makes success unlikely .",
    "the best way forward may be a deep ( 1ms ) observation of h1821 + 643 .",
    "h1821 + 643 remains the best target for such an investigation because of its x - ray brightness and well studied absorption , and because the _ chandra _ spectrum presented here provides 500 ksec of existing data and clear objectives for a future observation .",
