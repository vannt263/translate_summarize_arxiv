    "network datasets comprising _ edge _ measurements @xmath0 of a binary , symmetric , and anti - reflexive relation on a set of @xmath1 nodes , @xmath2 , are fast becoming of paramount interest in the statistical analysis and data mining literatures  @xcite .",
    "a common aim of many models for such data is to test for and explain the presence of network _ structure _ , primary examples being _ communities _ and _ blocks _ of nodes that are equivalent in some formal sense .",
    "algorithmic formulations of this problem take varied forms and span many literatures , touching on subjects as diverse as spectral graph theory  @xcite , statistical physics  @xcite , theoretical computer science  @xcite , economics  @xcite , and social network analysis  @xcite .",
    "one popular modeling assumption for network data is to assume dyadic independence of the edge measurements when conditioned on a set of latent variables  @xcite .",
    "the number of latent parameters in such models generally increases with the size of the graph , however , meaning that computationally intensive fitting algorithms may be required and standard consistency results may not always hold . as a result , it can often be difficult to assess statistical significance or quantify the uncertainty associated with parameter estimates .",
    "this issue is evident in literatures focused on community detection , where common practice is to examine whether algorithmically identified communities agree with prior knowledge or intuition  @xcite .",
    "this practice is less useful if additional confirmatory information is unavailable , or if detailed uncertainty quantification is desired .",
    "confidence sets are a standard statistical tool for uncertainty quantification , but they are not yet well developed for network data  @xcite . in this paper , we propose a family of confidence sets for network structure that apply under the assumption of a bernoulli product likelihood .",
    "the form of these sets stems from a stochastic blockmodel formulation which reflects the notion of latent nodal classes , and they provide a new tool for the analysis of estimated or algorithmically determined network structure .",
    "we demonstrate usage of the confidence sets by analyzing a sample of 26 adolescent friendship networks from the national longitudinal survey of adolescent health ( available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth ) , using a _ baseline _ model that only includes explanatory covariates and heterogeneity in the nodal degrees .",
    "we employ these confidence sets to validate departures from this baseline model taking the form of _ residual _ community structure .",
    "though the confidence sets we employ are known to be conservative  @xcite , we show that they are effective in identifying putative residual structure in these friendship network data .",
    "we represent dichotomous network data via a sociomatrix @xmath3 that reflects the adjacency structure of a simple , undirected graph on @xmath4 nodes . in keeping with the latent variable network analysis literature , we assume entries @xmath5 for @xmath6 to be independent bernoulli random variables with associated success probabilities @xmath7 , and complete @xmath8 as a symmetric matrix with zeros along its main diagonal .",
    "the corresponding data log - likelihood is given by @xmath9 where each @xmath10 can itself be modeled as a function of latent as well as explanatory variables . typically , the nodal indices themselves impart no inferential information and the latent variable formulation is exchangeable ; in fact , in lieu of independence one may start with a much weaker assumption that the graph itself is generated from an exchangeable distribution ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "exchangeability accommodates many types of dependencies that are of interest in network analysis , such as triadic closure .",
    "given an instantiation of @xmath8 and a latent variable model for the probabilities @xmath7 , it is natural to seek a quantification of the uncertainty associated with estimates of these bernoulli parameters .",
    "a standard approach in non - graphical settings is to posit a parametric form for each @xmath10 and then compute confidence intervals with respect to the corresponding parameter values , for example by appealing to standard maximum - likelihood asymptotics .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , the formulation of most latent variable network models dictates an increasing number of parameters as the number of network nodes grows ; as we have observed in our own exploratory data analysis , this amount of expressive power appears necessary to capture many salient characteristics of network data . as a result ,",
    "standard asymptotic results do not necessarily apply , leaving open questions for inference .      to illustrate the complexities that can quickly arise in this inferential setting , we adopt a latent variable network model with a standard flavor : a logistic regression model that simultaneously incorporates aspects of blockmodels , additive effects , and explanatory variables ( see  @xcite for a more general formulation ) . specifically",
    ", we incorporate a @xmath11-class stochastic blockmodel component parameterized in terms of a symmetric matrix @xmath12 and a membership vector @xmath13 whose values denote the class of each node , with @xmath10 depending on @xmath14 . a vector of additional node - specific latent variables @xmath15",
    "is included to account for heterogeneity in the observed nodal degrees , along with a vector of regression coefficients @xmath16 corresponding to explanatory variables @xmath17 .",
    "thus we obtain the log - odds parameterization @xmath18 where we further enforce the identifiability constraint that @xmath19 .    intuitively , the blockmodel component of model   serves to enforce stochastic equivalence of nodes in the same class  @xcite , after accounting for node - specific additive effects and covariates .",
    "blockmodeling in this manner is historically motivated by the deterministic notion of structural equivalence  @xcite , under which the network must remain identical under any relabeling of nodes within each community .",
    "while this notion is typically too strong to hold exactly , relaxations such as regular equivalence and other variations @xcite can be thought of as deterministic precursors to the stochastic blockmodel  @xcite and its modern extensions  @xcite .",
    "analogous to the deterministic setting , exact maximization of the corresponding log - likelihood @xmath20 is computationally demanding even for moderately large @xmath11 and @xmath4 , owing to the total number of possible nodal partitions induced by @xmath21 .",
    "however , when @xmath21 is fixed the corresponding conditional likelihood maximization task is convex , and so we may adopt a stochastic expectation - maximization ( em ) approach to inference in which @xmath21 is treated as missing data  @xcite .    1",
    ".   set @xmath22 and initialize @xmath23 .",
    "2 .   for iteration @xmath24 , do : + e - step : :    sample    @xmath25 +    ( e.g. , via gibbs sampling ) m - step : :    set    @xmath26 +    ( convex optimization ) 3 .",
    "set @xmath27 and return to step 2 .    exact sampling of @xmath21 according to the e - step of algorithm  [ alg:1 ] requires computing the normalizing constant of @xmath28 , and so we may instead approximate this step by a series of univariate draws from a coordinate - wise gibbs sampler that conditions on all other elements of @xmath21 in turn . when @xmath11 is moderate , both steps of algorithm  [ alg:1 ] are computationally tractable , since the gibbs sampler requires only discrete distributions over @xmath11 values , and the m - step optimization problem is convex .",
    "we note that the confidence sets developed in section [ sec : confsets ] will accommodate the sub - optimality of algorithm  [ alg:1 ] .",
    "when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are fixed to zero , model   reduces to a re - parameterization of the standard stochastic blockmodel .",
    "consistency results for this model have been developed for a range of conditions  @xcite ; alternative fitting methods with lower computational complexity , such as spectral clustering  @xcite and modularity maximization  @xcite , are also available for the stochastic blockmodel , with  @xcite noting that such approaches appear to perform well in practice .",
    "however , it is not clear how uncertainty in @xmath21 and @xmath29 should be quantified or even concisely expressed : in this vein , previous efforts to assess the robustness of fitted structure include  @xcite , in which community partitions are analyzed under perturbations of the network , and @xcite , in which the behavior of local minima resulting from simulated annealing is examined ; a likelihood - based test is proposed in  @xcite to compare sets of community divisions .    without the blockmodel components @xmath21 and @xmath29 , the model of eq .   reduces to a generalized linear model whose likelihood can be maximized by standard methods .",
    "if @xmath15 is further constrained to equal @xmath30 , the model is finite dimensional and standard asymptotic results for inference can be applied .",
    "otherwise , the increasing dimensionality of @xmath15 brings consistency into question , and in fact certain negative results are known for the related @xmath31 exponential random graph model  @xcite .",
    "specifically ,  @xcite reports that the maximum likelihood estimator for the @xmath31 model exhibits bias with magnitude equal to its variance .",
    "although estimation error does converge asymptotically to zero for the @xmath31 model , it is generally not known how to generate confidence intervals or hypothesis tests ;  @xcite prescribes reporting standard errors only as summary statistics , with no association to @xmath32-values .",
    "the predictions of  @xcite were replicated ( reported below ) when fitting simulated data drawn from the model of eq .   with parameters matched to observed characteristics of the adolescent health friendship networks .      instead of quantifying the uncertainty associated with estimates of the model parameters @xmath33 , we directly find confidence sets for the bernoulli likelihood parameters @xmath34 . to this end , for any fixed @xmath11 and class assignment @xmath21 , define symmetric matrices @xmath35 in @xmath36^{k \\times k}$ ] element - wise for @xmath37 as @xmath38 with @xmath39 denoting the maximum number of possible edges between classes @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( i.e. , the corresponding number of bernoulli trials ) .",
    "thus @xmath42 is the expected proportion of edges between ( or within , if @xmath43 ) classes @xmath40 and @xmath41 , under class assignment @xmath21 , and @xmath44 is its corresponding sample proportion estimator .    intuitively , @xmath45 measures _ assortativity _ by @xmath21 ; whenever the sociomatrix @xmath8 is unstructured , elements of @xmath45 should be nearly uniform for any choice of partition @xmath21 .",
    "when strong community structure is present in @xmath8 , however , these elements should instead be well separated for corresponding values of @xmath21 .",
    "thus , it is of interest to examine a confidence set that relates @xmath44 to its expected value @xmath45 for a range of partitions @xmath21 . to this end",
    ", we may define such a set by considering a weighted sum of the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 $ ] denotes the ( nonnegative ) kullback  leibler divergence of a bernoulli random variable with parameter @xmath48 from that of one with parameter @xmath32 .",
    "a confidence set is then obtainable via direct application of the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath49 be comprised of @xmath50 independent @xmath51 trials , and let @xmath52 .",
    "then with probability at least @xmath53 , @xmath54    because eq .",
    "holds uniformly over all class assignments , we may choose to apply it directly to the value of @xmath21 obtained from algorithm  [ alg:1]and because it does not assume any particular form of latent structure , we are able to avoid the difficulties associated with determining confidence sets directly for the parameters of latent variable models such as eq .  .",
    "however , it is important to note that this generality comes at a price : in simulation studies undertaken in  @xcite as well as those detailed below , we have observed the bound of eq .   to be loose by a multiplicative factor ranging from 3 to 7 on average .",
    "recalling our above discussion of estimator consistency for the related @xmath31 model , we undertook a small simulation study to investigate the consistency of maximum - likelihood ( ml ) estimation in a `` baseline '' version of model   with @xmath55 and the corresponding ( scalar ) value of @xmath29 set equal to zero .",
    "we compared estimates for the cases @xmath56 versus @xmath15 unconstrained for 500 graphs generated randomly from a model of the form specified in eq .",
    "based on school 8 of the add - health data set .",
    "the number of nodes @xmath57 and covariates @xmath17 matched that of school 8 in the adolescent health friendship network dataset , and the regression coefficient vector @xmath58 , set to match the ml estimate of @xmath16 for school 8 , fitted via logistic regression with @xmath59 .",
    "the covariates @xmath17 comprised of an intercept term , an indicator for whether students @xmath60 and @xmath61 shared the same gender , an indicator for shared race , and their difference in school grade .    the inclusion of @xmath15 in the model of eq",
    ".   appears to give rise to a loss of estimator consistency , as shown in table [ tab : sim ] where the empirical bias of each component of @xmath16 is reported .",

    "with @xmath11 in the range 26 to 50 draws from a restricted version of the model corresponding to each of the 26 schools in our dataset . in the same manner described above , each simulated graph shared the same size and covariates as its corresponding school in the dataset , with @xmath16 fixed to its ml - fitted value with @xmath59 .",
    "the empirical divergence term @xmath64 under the approximate ml partition determined via algorithm  [ alg:1 ] was then tabulated for each of these 1300 fits , and compared to its 95% confidence upper bound given by eq .  .",

    "[ fig : divergence histogram ] that the largest divergence observed was less than 41% of its corresponding bound , with 95% of all divergences less than 22% of their corresponding bound .",
    "this analysis verifies that , despite the issues associated with estimator consistency in the context of latent variable models , our confidence sets can be used as a tool to assess putative network structure .",
    "this analysis also provides an indication of how inflated the confidence set sizes are expected to be in practice ; while conservative in nature , they seem usable for practical situations .",
    "we now turn our attention to an analysis of friendship networks from the national longitudinal survey of adolescent health ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite for a recent analysis and in - depth discussion .",
    "previous studies have looked for trends which held across several schools , such as clustering by race @xcite . within a school ,",
    "however , it may be desirable to go beyond reported covariates such as gender , race , or grade in describing social structure .",
    "here we examine the schools individually to find residual block structure not explained by the covariates .",
    "since we will be unable to verify such blocks by checking against explanatory variables , we rely on the confidence sets developed above to assess significance of the discovered block structure .",
    "recall from section  [ sec : confsets ] that eq .   enables us to calculate confidence sets with respect to bernoulli parameters @xmath65 for any class membership vector @xmath21 in terms of the corresponding sample proportion matrices @xmath66 .",
    "then , by comparing values of @xmath66 to a baseline model obtained by fitting @xmath67 ( thus removing the stochastic block component from eq .  ) , we may evaluate whether or not the observed sample counts are consistent with the structure predicted by the baseline model .",
    "this procedure provides a kind of notional @xmath32-value to qualitatively assess significance of the residual structure induced by any choice of @xmath21 .    in section  [ sec : datadescription ]",
    "below , we describe the dataset . then , in section  [ sec : modelchecking ] , we verify empirically that the models provide reasonable fits and conclusions , first by fitting our baseline model ( @xmath55 ) and checking its behavior , and then by fitting a `` pure '' stochastic blockmodel ( @xmath68 ) and observing that we can recover block structure corresponding to held - out grade covariates . in section  [ sec : residblockstruct ] , we consider estimates of @xmath21 obtained via algorithm  [ alg:1 ] for @xmath11 in the range 26 , and use our notion of confidence sets introduced above to evaluate how unlikely the corresponding observed configurations of @xmath66 are , relative to an underlying set of bernoulli random variables whose parameters are assumed to be equal to those fitted under our baseline model .",

    "[ sec : sim ] , for each student pair the corresponding vector @xmath17 of explanatory variables comprised an intercept term , binary indicator variables indicating shared gender and shared race , and an ordinal value equal to the absolute difference in the grades of the students ; model   was then fitted to these data , with results described below .",

    "the parameter fits were examined and an analysis of deviance was conducted .",
    "the fits were observed to be well behaved in this setting ; estimates of @xmath16 and their corresponding standard errors indicate a clustering effect by grade that is stronger than that of either shared gender or race .",
    "the fitting thus appears consistent with the previous analysis of  @xcite , in which student friendship clusters were observed to closely align with grades .",
    "an analysis of deviance , where each variable was withheld from the model , resulted in similar conclusions : average deviances across the 26 schools were @xmath6369 , @xmath63238 , and @xmath633760 for gender , race , and grade respectively , with @xmath32-values below @xmath69 indicating significance in all but 3 , 7 , and 0 of the schools for each of the respective covariates ; these schools had small numbers of students , with a maximum @xmath4 of 108 .    because standard analysis techniques do not apply to the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath29 , before fitting the full model we first fit models using these terms separately , and checked if the results were intuitive .",

    "estimates of @xmath16 did not undergo qualitative significant changes from their earlier values when the restriction @xmath56 was lifted .    a `` pure '' stochastic blockmodel ( @xmath70 )",

    "we also expanded the covariates by giving each race and grade pairing its own indicator function .",

    "<S> latent variable models are frequently used to identify structure in dichotomous network data , in part because they give rise to a bernoulli product likelihood that is both well understood and consistent with the notion of exchangeable random graphs . in this article we propose conservative confidence sets that hold with respect to these underlying bernoulli parameters as a function of any given partition of network nodes , enabling us to assess estimates of _ residual _ network structure , that is , structure that can not be explained by known covariates and thus can not be easily verified by manual inspection . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the proposed methodology by analyzing student friendship networks from the national longitudinal survey of adolescent health that include race , gender , and school year as covariates . we employ a stochastic expectation - maximization algorithm to fit a logistic regression model that includes these explanatory variables as well as a latent stochastic blockmodel component and additional node - specific effects . </S>",
    "<S> although maximum - likelihood estimates do not appear consistent in this context , we are able to evaluate confidence sets as a function of different blockmodel partitions , which enables us to qualitatively assess the significance of estimated residual network structure relative to a baseline , which models covariates but lacks block structure . </S>"
