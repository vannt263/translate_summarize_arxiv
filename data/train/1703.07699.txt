    "an optical double trap is generated using two cross - polarized beams from a continuous - wave infrared laser ( @xmath63  nm ) , split by a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "one polarization is frequency shifted by 40 mhz with an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) to suppress effects related to interferences of the two trapping beams . before entering the chamber ,",
    "the two orthogonal polarizations are recombined using a second pbs , and focused by a n.a.=0.8 objective .",
    "the transverse position of the focus depends on the beam angle at the objective back - focal - plane .",
    "the relative angle of the two trapping beams can be easily changed using a telecentric @xmath64 setup combined with a steering mirror ( sm , newport fast steering mirror ) .",
    "in addition , the optical power of each trapping beam can be adjusted using half - wave plates ( hwp ) . therefore , by changing the angle and adjusting the power we can tune the symmetry and the depth of the optical double - well potential .",
    "+        an additional green laser ( @xmath65  nm ) is used for measurement .",
    "it is combined with the trapping beams using a dichroic mirror ( dm ) .",
    "the beam size of the measurement laser at the objective back - aperture is chosen such that the effective na for this beam is roughly @xmath66 .",
    "this helps to reduce the nonlinearities in the position measurement over the whole optical double trap .",
    "the measurement beam is then recollimated with an aspheric lens ( asl ) , and isolated from the trapping beam using a 532  nm band pass filter ( bpf ) . + the detection scheme is based on a common path interferometer and is described in ref .  .",
    "in short , the motion of the particle is imprinted in the phase of the re - scattered light , which interferes with the non - scattered transmitted light beam .",
    "the phase modulation is thus converted into an amplitude modulation that is directly recorded using fiber coupled 80 mhz balanced detectors ( 1807-fc , newport ) . for a particle close to the focus of the measurement beam",
    ", recording the raw signal provides a signal proportional to the particle s @xmath67-motion .",
    "similarly , by splitting the beam vertically [ or horizontally ] with a d - shape mirror ( dsm ) , a signal proportional to the @xmath68 [ or @xmath32 ] motion is obtained . as it will be deeply discussed in the next section , a particle traveling further from the optical axis , as in the present work",
    ", will introduce non linearities in the measurement scheme .",
    "thus , an accurate description of the particle dynamics will require accounting for these nonlinearities .",
    "a voltage is recorded on the three detectors . to reconstruct the full dynamics of the particle",
    "it is important to connect the recorded voltage to a distance in nanometre through a calibration factor @xmath70 .",
    "recent experiments involving levitated particles in vacuum work in a regime where the recorded signal is simply linear with the particle position , and as a consequence , the calibration factor @xmath70 is a constant . in the present work",
    "the particle can travel in a larger spatial range , and the detection scheme is not linear anymore . to account for these nonlinearities",
    "we introduce the calibration functions @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the considered axis , and @xmath73 the position of the particle .        to experimentally determine the @xmath74 functions ,",
    "a particle is trapped using a single trapping beam .",
    "the fast steering mirror associated to a telecentric system allows scanning the trap particle through the focal plane of the objective ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sxx_11x11]-(a ) ) . at each point of this focal plane",
    "the particle dynamics is recorded for 2  s using a fixed measurement beam .",
    "the telecentric system allows keeping the eigen - axis of the particle trapping potential aligned with the measurement axis .",
    "the power spectral density ( psd ) is computed from the recorded time traces for the 3 measurement axes @xmath68 , @xmath32 and @xmath67 .",
    "each of the psds can present 3 peaks , at the three eigenfrequencies @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , corresponding to the three eigen - axis of the trap . this rise from cross coupling between the different measurement axes . indeed , under certain circumstances the @xmath68-detector may , for example , detect a signal coming from the @xmath32 and/or the @xmath67 particle s motion ( fig .  [",
    "fig : sxx_11x11]-(b ) ) . to completely characterise the detection nonlinearities , including axes cross coupling , each of these three peaks is fitted by the function @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are adjustable parameters , and @xmath81 the measurement axis . as an example , a psd @xmath82 recorded for the particle away from the measurement beam s centre is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sxx_11x11 ] .",
    "the measurement is overlaid with analytical fitting functions according eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfit ] ) .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath83 of the three peaks present in the psd",
    "give an idea about how each detector is sensitive to the particle motion , both along the axis of interest , and along the two orthogonal axes ( cross coupling ) .",
    "these amplitudes , normalized by the overall maximum amplitude @xmath84 , for the three trap eigen - frequencies and for each detector are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sensxy ] . as expected , we observe that the detection sensitivity is constant only nearby the centre of the measurement beam .",
    "when going further away the sensitivity drops for the three measurement axes .",
    "similarly , if each detector is sensitive only to one axis close to the measurement beam s centre , going further away introduces cross coupling .",
    "such a behaviour is theoretically expected and has already previously been used to extend the spatial range of particle dynamics studies  @xcite .    in the present case , since the particle is localised around the centre of the measurement beam for the @xmath68 and @xmath67 axes , and is only travelling further in the @xmath32-double trap axis ( blue dotted rectangle area in figure  [ fig : sensxy ] ) we assume that cross coupling can be neglected and that the detection sensitivity depends only on @xmath32-axis . by virtue of the equipartition theorem ,",
    "the integrated area under the power spectral density is proportional to the bath temperature @xmath85  @xcite .",
    "therefore , from the fit of the psd we extract the calibration function for each axis : @xmath86 that converts the measured voltage on the detector to particle displacement in meters . to reduce noise",
    "this calibration function is integrated along @xmath68 axis on the blue dotted rectangle area of figure  [ fig : sensxy ] .",
    "the obtained calibration functions for the three different axes are shown in figure  [ fig : calibxyz ] .",
    "these functions are fitted by a 10th order polynom ( red solid line ) that is used to calibrate the particle position from the recorded time traces . from these calibration functions we estimate the sensitivity of our measurement .",
    "the typical noise on the detectors is on the order of 300  @xmath18v . given that the conversion factor for @xmath68 and @xmath32 axes is better than 50  nm / mv we deduce that the position is known with a precision better than 15  nm . for the @xmath67 axis ,",
    "the sensitivity is almost ten times worse due to the use of a weakly focused measurement beam .",
    "however , errors in the @xmath67 axis position estimation only affects the theoretical rate estimation weakly , since this axis is orthogonal to the trapping axis .        measuring the psd of the particle dynamics also allows retrieving information about the environmental damping @xmath0 .",
    "the particle dynamics , while trapped in the centre of the measurement beam is recorded at different gas pressures and the psd is computed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calib]-(a ) ) .        from the fits we retrieve the value of the environmental damping @xmath0 and",
    "verify its linear relationship with the pressure @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : calib]-(b ) ) .",
    "as expected from kinetic theory for a 68  nm radius particle  @xcite , we experimentally measure @xmath87  hz / pa . +      to determine the particle jumping rate we split the space into two sub - spaces @xmath88 and @xmath89 . these two sub - spaces are separated by a dividing surface , which sets the boundary between the two traps @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "transition rates are extracted from the time autocorrelation function @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the binary population function defined as @xmath92 and @xmath93 is the fluctuation of @xmath91 .    with this approach , the resulting rate constant",
    "is not affected by the exact position of the dividing surface .",
    "therefore , for simplicity , we choose the @xmath94 plane as a separating surface .",
    "thus , the population binary function is obtained by assigning to each measurement point @xmath95 of the particle motion , the value @xmath96 an example of the time evolution of the population function @xmath91 is shown in figure  [ fig : ha ] .",
    "+ the time autocorrelation @xmath97 of a particle jumping between two traps is characterized , in general , by a transient for short times ( due to correlated recrossings ) followed by an exponential decay  @xcite .",
    "an exponential fit @xmath39 of the long - time behaviour yields the jumping rate @xmath98 .",
    "+          as explained in the main text , the optical potential is derived from the particle distribution function @xmath12 obtained by histogramming the particle position time trace .",
