    "in their survey for ob stars in the field of the carina nebula ( ngc3372 ) , forte & orsatti ( 1981 ) discovered an early o type star in the darkest region of the nebula .",
    "this star ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6 ; v=12.05 ) , number 15 in their list of new ob stars , was assigned a spectral classification o4v on photographic image tube spectrograms .",
    "the star has been named in subsequent literature .    in an infrared study of the stellar population in the direction of the carina nebula , smith ( 1987 )",

    "fo15 was observed as a faint x - ray source in einstein satellite x - ray images of the carina nebula ( chlebowski et al .",
    "because one of the most often proposed mechanisms for producing x - rays from o - type stars are colliding stellar winds in binary systems , we decided to include fo15 in our ongoing optical spectroscopic observations in search for o - type binaries .    in this paper",
    ", we will present our spectroscopic observations of fo15 showing this star to be a double  lined binary system with a short orbital period .",
    "after our spectroscopic analysis was essentially complete , fo15 also appeared as an eclipsing binary in the all sky automated survey ( asas ) ( cf .",

    "twenty five spectral images of fo15 were obtained with the 2.15-m telescope at complejo astronmico el leoncito ( casleo ) in san juan , argentina , during several observing runs between february 1996 and march 2003 .",
    "we used , alternatively , the cassegrain boller & chivens ( b&c ) spectrograph , with a 600 lmm@xmath8 grating and a pm  516@xmath9516 20@xmath10 m pixel ccd as detector , and the reosc echelle spectrograph , in its simple dispersion mode .",
    "for the reosc spectra a tek  1024@xmath91024 pixel ccd , with pixel size of 24@xmath10 m was used as detector .",

    "we used a slit width of 2 arcsec for all our casleo spectra .",
    "exposure times for the stellar images ranged between 30 minutes and 1 hour , resulting in spectra of signal - to - noise ratio between 50 and 150 , depending on seeing and transparency .",
    "he - ar and cu - ar comparison arc images were observed with the b&c and reosc spectrographs , respectively , at the same telescope position as the stellar images immediately after or before the stellar exposures .",
    "the usual series of bias and flat - field frames were also obtained for each observing night .",
    "one high resolution spectral image of was obtained with eso - vlt ut2 ( kueyen ) and the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) in december 2001 .",
    "the setting used produced a blue spectrum covering the region 3260 - 4520 with a resolution ( 2 pixels ) r = 67000 and a red one spanning from 4580 to 6690 at a spectral resolution ( 2 pixels ) r = 58000 .",
    "high gain , 2 @xmath9 2 binning mode was used .",
    "a signal - to - noise of @xmath1150 was achieved in this observation .",
    "further three high resolution spectra were obtained at las campanas observatory ( lco ) , as follows : one in december 2002 , with the magellan ii ( clay ) 6.5-m telescope and magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) double echelle spectrograph ( bernstein et al . 2003 ) .",
    "a 1 @xmath9 3 binning was applied achieving a resolution of 19000 in the red spectrum ( 4500 - 7200  ) and 29000 in the blue spectrum ( 3200 - 4700  ) , at a signal - to - noise ranging from 60 to 200 in the red and from 40 to 100 in the blue in a 1200s exposure using a 1 arcsec slit width .",

    "th - ar comparison lamps were secured for every high resolution observation as well as the usual series of bias and flat - field exposures .",
    "all the spectral images were processed and analyzed with standard iraf routines .",
    "mike spectra were extracted using the iraf tasks contained in the _ mtools _ package , developed by j. baldwin and available for downloading from lco website .",
    "our spectra of confirm that the stellar spectrum corresponds to an o  type star , as illustrated in fig.[fig02 ] . in this figure",
    "we also observe that the heii absorption at @xmath154686 is stronger than any of the other heii lines , a proposed signature of a zero  age  main  sequence luminosity class ( vz ) for o stars ( cf . walborn & blades 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "a visual inspection of our first spectra of which we obtained at casleo in 1996 , december , during successive nights , showed that the stellar hydrogen absorption lines moved from the blueside to the redside of the nebular emissions , a signature of a rather high amplitude orbital motion in a binary system .",
    "this was confirmed with further observations , which also showed that the neutral helium lines appeared double at maximum velocities , but ionized helium lines always appeared single , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] , which depicts two spectra obtained at casleo during approximately opposite orbital phases of the binary ( see below ) .",
    "the spectrum of appears somewhat variable , as occasionally faint niii emisson at @xmath15 4634 - 40 appears , as seen in the upper spectrum of fig.[fig03 ] .",
    "however , the radial velocities of this emission do not clearly correspond to any of the binary components , and it may arise in the zone of interaction of the close components .",
    "nebular emission lines are observed in our spectra , as well as nebular hei @xmath15 3888 absorption .",
    "the interstellar absorption lines of caii and nai appear multiple . these are common features observed towards the giant hii region of carina ( e.g. walborn & hesser 1975 , walborn et al .",
    "the main components of caii absorption in our echelle spectra have a heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath16 , the nebular [ oiii ] @xmath15 5007 emission a velocity of @xmath17 , and the nebular hei @xmath15 3888 absorption of @xmath18 .",
    "we have used these velocities to check the consistency of the stellar radial velocities derived from our lower resolution spectra .",
    "spectral classification of components in a close binary systems is not as straightforward task as classifying spectra of single stars . in very close systems of hot stars , such as fo15 ,",
    "mutual heating effects may introduce a spectral appearance with hotter effective temperature .",
    "furthermore , spectral variations due to the interaction of stellar winds of the components are often observed .",
    "we have chosen the usual approach to classify the binary components of in the spectrograms observed when the spectral lines have their maximum separation . to determine the spectral types",
    ", we measured in our higher resolution spectra the equivalent widths of the hei and heii lines .",
    "we then used the cuantitative classification criteria for o - type stars as described by conti & alschuler ( 1971 ) , comparing the equivalent widths of hei@xmath154471 vs. heii@xmath154542 .",
    "we also compared hei@xmath154922 vs. heii@xmath155411 , as suggested by kerton et al .",
    "according to these criteria , we obtained for the primary component of a spectral classifications of o5.5v .",
    "we note however , that the spectrum observed near the orbital phase when the primary star is in front of the system ( see fig .  [ fig02 ] ) and the contribution of the secondary to the spectrum is expected to be minor , corresponds to a spectral type about one subtype later than o5.5 , when compared with the digital spectral atlas of o - type stars published by walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary component is more difficult to ascertain .",

    "heii@xmath155411 absorption of the secondary component may also be present , but it appears blended with the diffuse interstellar bands at @xmath125404 and 5420 .",
    "the spectral type of the secondary component probably is o9.5v , but could be slightly later .",
    "we do not observe in our optical spectra of  any mass - loss indicators ( signs of strong stellar winds ) , such as those listed e.g. by hutchings ( 1978 ) .",
    "the balmer h@xmath7 line is observed in absorption in both binary components , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figha ] .",
    "the radial velocity of this absorption agrees with the values derived from he lines , indicating that the h@xmath7 absorption is mostly photospheric , and not formed in the accelerated part of an expanding atmosphere .",
