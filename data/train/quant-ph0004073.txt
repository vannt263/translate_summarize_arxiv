    "when max planck introduced the concept of quantization one hundred years ago @xcite , he was painfully aware that this theory did not fit in with maxwell s highly successful theory of electromagnetic radiation . specifically , the assumption that the energy of the continuous light field can only have a discrete set of values appears to be in contradiction with the necessary continuity of interference phenomena . in the more complete formalism of quantum mechanical operators and states ,",
    "this strange relationship of a discrete light field intensity given by a photon number @xmath0 and the continuous quadrature components @xmath1 and @xmath2 is expressed by the operator equation @xmath3 if @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 were given by real numbers , continuous shifts in @xmath1 and @xmath2 such as the ones caused by interference with another field mode should cause continuous changes in @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are operators with non orthogonal eigenstates .",
    "precise knowledge of the eigenvalue of @xmath0 therefore restricts the possible knowledge about @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this uncertainty between the photon number @xmath0 and the quadrature components @xmath1 and @xmath2 is a necessary requirement for the discreteness of the eigenvalues of the photon number @xmath0 .",
    "however , uncertainty can not explain the quantization of photon number .",
    "even arbitrarily small changes in @xmath1 and @xmath2 cause either no change in photon number , or seemingly discontinuous `` quantum jumps '' changing the photon number by at least one full photon .",
    "the randomness of these quantum jumps may seem to defy further analysis .",
    "yet , equation ( [ eq : opsum ] ) indicates some correlation between the photon number @xmath0 and the quadrature components @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in order to investigate this correlation , it is useful to consider quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements with a finite measurement resolution @xcite .",
    "since the measured light field is not absorbed in a qnd measurement , further measurements performed on a different property of the same field are possible @xcite . in this manner ,",
    "photon number measurements may be combined with quadrature component measurements . even though the measurement interaction introduces some noise into the field ,",
    "the finite measurement resolution permits a limitation of noise to the minimum required by the uncertainty relations .",
    "the measurement result of the qnd measurement can then be correlated with the outcome of the final measurement performed on the same light field mode @xcite .",
    "since the noise introduced in the qnd measurement should not depend on the measurement result , this correlation reveals fundamental quantum mechanical properties of the original light field state .",

    "a measurement of @xmath7 can still be avoided by reading out the noise variable @xmath8 .",

    "if the meter variable @xmath6 is read out , however , information about the system variable @xmath7 is obtained while the uncertainty of the noise term @xmath8 causes an uncontrollable change in all other system properties @xmath12 .    by identifying the measurement readout of @xmath6 directly with the most likely value @xmath14 of @xmath7",
