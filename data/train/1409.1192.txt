    "trapped ions are a highly controllable system with strong interactions and thus find many applications , for example in precision measurements , quantum computing or quantum sensing  @xcite .",
    "currently , a growing number of experiments combines trapped ions with ultracold atoms  @xcite , allowing to study the dynamics of a single ion immersed in an atomic bose - einstein condensate  @xcite or to control chemical reactions of a single ion and ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "further prospects include the idea to build a quantum simulator with a hybrid system of ultracold ions and atoms to emulate solid - state physics  @xcite or to form ultracold molecular ions  @xcite .",
    "any experimental proposal based on a hybrid system of ultracold ions and atoms has to face two issues .",
    "the first one is the choice of trapping method for the ions ; the second one is potential losses due to chemical reactions between ions and atoms .",
    "although optical traps for ions have become available  @xcite , radio - frequency ( rf ) based paul traps still constitute the most popular choice  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the time - dependent rf potential induces micromotion of the ion that limits the minimum temperature that can be achieved  @xcite .",
    "the impact of micromotion can be minimized by choosing a large ion to atom mass ratio  @xcite .",
    "an yb@xmath0 ion immersed in an ultracold gas of li atoms is thus a perfect candidate to construct a hybrid ion - atom experiment . besides the large ion to atom",
    "mass ratio to facilitate cooling , the relatively simple electronic structure of the ( liyb)@xmath0 molecular ion , with the entrance channel yb@xmath0(@xmath4)+li(@xmath4 ) well separated from other electronic states , reduces potential nonradiative losses .",
    "nevertheless , to estimate the rates for radiative loss as well as the ratio of elastic to inelastic collision cross sections , reliable knowledge of the electronic structure is needed .",
    "this is essential both for realizing sympathetic cooling of the ion by the atoms  @xcite and for coupling a crystal of trapped yb@xmath0 ions to a cloud of ultracold fermionic li atoms , as proposed for building a quantum simulator to emulate solid - state physics  @xcite .",

    "the collision can entail the following processes : elastic scattering ( a ) , superelastic ( spin - changing ) scattering ( b ) , radiative charge transfer ( c ) , radiative association ( d ) , photoassociation to ground ( e ) or excited ( e ) states , and feshbach resonance based magnetoassociation ( f ) . ]    to the best of our knowledge , the electronic structure and collisional properties of the yb@xmath0 ion interacting with the li atom have not been investigated theoretically  . here",
    "we fill this gap and report an _ ab initio _ study of the interactions of the yb@xmath0 ion with the li atom , the system of interest in an ongoing experiment  @xcite .",
    "first , we investigate the electronic structure of the ( liyb)@xmath0 molecular ion by means of state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ techniques .",
    "next , we employ the electronic structure data to investigate the prospects for sympathetic cooling , spontaneous radiative association , laser - induced association ( photoassociation ) , and observation of feshbach resonances .",

    "[ fig : kinelvsb_fer ] and  [ fig : kinelvsb_bos ] present the rates for radiative losses , that is , radiative association and radiative charge transfer , as a function of magnetic field for collisions of the same species at the same temperatures as in figs .",
    "[ fig : kelvsb_fer ] and  [ fig : kelvsb_bos ] .",
    "in contrast to the elastic scattering rates , feshbach and shape resonances are clearly visible for all investigated temperatures . far from resonances the typical rates for elastic scattering are , as expected , at least three orders of magnitude larger than the rates for radiative losses .    comparing figs .",
    "[ fig : kelvsb_fer ] and  [ fig : kelvsb_bos ] to figs .",
    "[ fig : kinelvsb_fer ] and  [ fig : kinelvsb_bos ] , a different temperature dependence of the rates for elastic scattering and radiative losses is observed .",
    "this can be understood by analyzing the mechanisms of the two processes : the elastic rates are dominated by reflection from the long range potential . for higher partial waves with a large centrifugal barrier which dominate at high collision energies , the appearance of feshbach resonances",
    "is strongly suppressed . by contrast",
    ", radiative losses occur at short internuclear distance only . for high partial waves ,",

    "the characteristics of feshbach resonances such as the density of resonances , the temperature dependence of elastic and inelastic cross sections , and the feasibility of controlling the ion - atom interaction with an external magnetic field are similar to those discussed above .",
    "in particular , they depend on the choice of the entrance channel characterized by the hyperfine states of atom and ion and the scattering length",
    ". different isotopes of yb can be used to control the structure of feshbach resonances due to the different masses . however , this control is somewhat limited since , due to the much smaller mass of the li atom , the scattering length depends less on the mass of the yb atom as compared to mass - balanced mixtures .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the scattering length can be exploited to ensure the condition needed for sympathetic cooling .",

    "[ fig : kinelvsb_fer ] ( top and middle panel ) . tuning the magnetic field to such a value",

    "[ fig : kelvsb_fer ] and  [ fig : kelvsb_bos ] , to increase the elastic rate constant while keeping inelastic losses at bay .",
    "the exact positions of the feshbach resonances will depend on the true value of the scattering length .",
    "however , the characteristics of the presented results , such as the density of resonances , are general and depend essentially on the hyperfine structure and nature of colliding ion and atom .",
    "we therefore expect our predictions to be valid , independent of the specific value of the background scattering length .",
    "the magnetic field dependence can also be employed to enhance the inelastic rate constants , in case one is interested in the observation of cold chemical reactions .",

    "for example , a non - resonant laser field will lead to a strong stark effect that can be used to control energy level shifts state - selectively .",

    "our results predict a sufficiently large ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering cross sections , and thus feasibility of sympathetic cooling , in the temperature range between 10@xmath3mk and 10@xmath122k for both small and large values of the scattering length .",
    "prospects for sympathetic cooling all the way down to 10@xmath3nk for the ion trapped in an optical dipole trap also look good .",
    "however , at these very low temperatures , resonances may have a detrimental effect , and our predictions come with some uncertainty due to the unknown exact value of the scattering length .",
    "we have critically assessed the validity of our results by scaling the interaction potential , assuming an accuracy of the _ ab initio _ data of @xmath160 . except for extremely narrow ranges of the scaling factor",

    "the probability that the true interaction potential corresponds to an unfavorable value of the scaling factor is very small , and such an unfortunate case could be remedied by changing the isotope .",

    "this implies excellent prospects for building a quantum simulator using yb@xmath0 ions immersed in a gas of ultracold li atoms , bringing quantum simulation of solid - state physics with amo experiments a step closer to reality  @xcite .    moreover , since radiative association is found to dominate radiative inelastic processes , ( liyb)@xmath0 is also a good candidate for observing ultracold atom - ion chemical reactions . _",

    "photoassociation can utilize one - photon transitions to levels with moderate binding energies .",
    "the formation of molecular ions in their absolute ground state will require additional raman transitions .",
    "our calculated photoassociation spectra are also important for optical trapping since they indicate that photoassociation losses are likely to occur at wavelengths close to 1064@xmath3 nm . since photoassociation lines are typically quite narrow , it should be possible to avoid these losses by proper tuning of the trapping laser .",
    "our calculations indicate in which regions transitions are to be expected but would need to be corroborated by spectroscopy for quantitative predictions .",
    "molecular ions offer a particularly interesting perspective for photoassociation and related spectroscopies , in that state - selective detection of a single molecular ion in the trap should be possible .",
    "such a detection scheme can be based on a change of the trapping frequency due to the change of the ion mass when the bond is formed or broken .",
    "state selectivity could be achieved by exploiting the differences in the stark shifts of different rovibrational levels which modify the spectrum of the trapped ion .",
    "one can thus envision a series of photoassociation and dissociation experiments , detected by changes in the fluorescence wavelength .",
    "similarly , one can photo - induce , and potentially control , ion - neutral chemical reactions by laser excitation of li into the @xmath75 state . due to the favorable shape of the corresponding @xmath161 state , this might provide an alternative and more direct route for producing molecular ions in their absolute ground state than photoassociation into the @xmath6 ground electronic state .    to conclude , li+yb@xmath0 represents an extremely promising example of hybrid atom - ion systems .",
    "good prospects for sympathetic cooling should allow for its application in quantum simulation in the not too distant future  @xcite , and several pathways to molecule formation imply interesting avenues for cold controlled chemical reactions .",

    "<S> the electronic structure of the ( liyb)@xmath0 molecular ion is investigated with two variants of the coupled cluster method restricted to single , double , and noniterative or linear triple excitations . </S>",
    "<S> potential energy curves for the ground and excited states , permanent and transition electric dipole moments , and long - range interaction coefficients @xmath1 and @xmath2 are reported . </S>",
    "<S> the data is subsequently employed in scattering calculations and photoassociation studies . </S>",
    "<S> feshbach resonances are shown to be measurable , despite the ion s micromotion in the paul trap . </S>",
    "<S> molecular ions can be formed in their singlet electronic ground state by one - photon photoassociation and in triplet states by two - photon photoassociation ; and control of cold atom - ion chemistry based on feshbach resonances should be feasible . </S>",
    "<S> conditions for sympathetic cooling of an yb@xmath0 ion by an ultracold gas of li atoms are found to be favorable in the temperature range of 10@xmath3nk to 10@xmath3mk ; and further improvements using feshbach resonances should be possible . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these results suggest excellent prospects for building a quantum simulator with ultracold yb@xmath0 ions and li atoms . </S>"
