    "new accelerators like cebaf , mami - b and cosy will investigate hadron observables at a scale intermediate to the low - energy region where hadron phenomena mainly reflect the underlying principles of chiral symmetry and its dynamical breakdown and to the high momentum region where the `` strong '' interaction has the appearance of being a perturbation on free - moving quarks and gluons .",
    "a reasonable theoretical description of intermediate energy physics therefore has to satisfy at least the following requirements : formulated in terms of quarks and gluons it has to account for a mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) and identify the related goldstone bosons in the measured spectrum of quark bound states .",
    "in addition , all the correlation functions have to transform properly under the renormalization group of quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , _ i.e. _ at large momenta one should recover the correct anomalous dimensions .",
    "only if these requirements are fulfilled the theoretical framework is fast in those grounds of the theory of strong interaction that are well established .",
    "furthermore , it is desirable to formulate a microscopic picture of the cause of confinement .    in this context growing interest",
    "has been focused on the euclidean dyson ",
    "schwinger equations ( dse s ) as a tool for developping and applying non - perturbative methods in quantum field theories , a recent review on this subject is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "realistic models of qcd derived through truncation of the dse tower are _ applicable in the whole euclidean momentum space _ and , among others , have the following features : quark condensation gives rise to dcsb , the chiral goldstone bosons are identified with the lowest mass pseudoscalar quark - antiquark bound states , perturbative qcd is matched at large momenta , and a study of the analytic structure of the quark propagator provides some insight into the mechanism of confinement .",
    "the dse s include the bethe - salpeter equations ( bse s ) for bound states , especially the ones describing physical mesons @xcite .",
    "the bse s are coupled to the dse s for the quark and gluon propagators , _",
    "i.e. _  the bse s need as input at least the full renormalized quark and gluon propagators which  for calculating the meson mass spectrum , for instance  have to be known at complex euclidean momenta far away from the real axis . in principle",
    ", the quark and gluon propagators can be determined from their dse s . as these are coupled to the infinite tower of dse s",
    "one is not able to solve the equations exactly .",
    "possible approximation schemes are based on the truncation of the dse tower : some @xmath1-point functions like the gluon propagator and the quark - gluon vertex are parametrized choosing _ anstze _ such that certain requirements are fulfilled .",
    "important constraints are imposed by the discrete and continuous symmetries of qcd most of which are formulated in ward or slavnov - taylor identities .",
    "additional input may be taken from hadron phenomenology .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the analytic structure of the quark propagator using the euclidean dse for the quark self energy in rainbow approximation where the full quark - gluon vertex is replaced by the perturbative one .",
    "the main ingredient for our study is a color diagonal gluon propagator whose transverse part vanishes at zero four momentum : @xmath2 herein @xmath3 denotes the ( spacelike ) gluon momentum and @xmath0 is an energy scale to be determined .",
    "this form of the gluon propagator is motivated by very distinct considerations .",
    "one is based on the complete elimination of gribov copies within a lattice formulation of non - abelian gauge theories@xcite : landau gauge is fixed uniquely with the help of a ` thermodynamic parameter ' .",
    "the resulting functional integral is dominated by field configurations on the gribov horizon .",
    "this implies that the gluon propagator vanishes for small momenta @xmath3 as @xmath4 .",
    "in a couple of different studies a gluon propagator of the form ( [ stingl1 ] ) is obtained by considering a generalized perturbative expansion of the seven superficially divergent proper vertices of qcd which are allowed to depend non - analytically on the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the field strength approach ( fsa ) to qcd supports the form ( [ stingl1 ] ) for being the dominant part of the infrared quark - quark interaction@xcite ; however , the color structure of the fsa gluon propagator is not diagonal . at last",
    ", some recent lattice calculations obtained a gluon propagator which allow a fit of the form ( [ stingl1 ] ) ( but which do not rule out a fit using a standard massive particle propagator)@xcite .",
    "as the gluon propagator ( [ stingl1 ] ) has no poles for timelike momenta it may be argued that it describes confined gluons .",
    "instead , the gluon propagator has poles on the imaginary axis , @xmath5 , and therefore the gluon ` decays ' after some time @xmath6 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the gluons being screened . on the other hand ,",
    "the gluon propagator ( [ stingl1 ] ) is smaller than the perturbative one for all momenta : @xmath7 .",
    "this has drastic consequences for dcsb as we will show : for the values of @xmath0 that are suggested by the lattice studies of ref .",
    "@xcite chiral symmetry will be realized in the nambu - goldstone mode for unrealistic large coupling constants only .",
    "we also find that quarks are not confined in this model , at least for a large range of model parameters @xmath0 .",
    "a similar study was undertaken by hawes et al.@xcite . in this work the gluon propagator ( [ stingl1 ] ) and",
    "a non - trivial quark - gluon vertex has been used to calculate the quark propagator in the spacelike region .",
    "their results are similar to ours , especially they find unconfined quarks .",
    "in contrast to our work where the analytic continuation to timelike momenta is performed explicitly and a pole signaling free massive quasi quarks as asymptotic states is found , hawes et al .  use a test for confinement employing a fourier transformation of the quark schwinger functions .",
    "the large time behavior of these fourier transforms indicate asymptotic states of massive deconfined quarks .    in sec .  2 we present our model dse for the quark self energy",
    "we also discuss the _ ansatz _ eq .",
    "( [ stingl1 ] ) for the gluon propagator in more detail . in sec .  3 we present the numerical solution for the quark self energy at real euclidean momenta and discuss the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry . in sec .  4",

    "( [ sderen ] ) one has to put in the full gluon propagator and the full quark - gluon vertex ; an exact investigation of the quark dse  ( [ sderen ] ) therefore requires solving their dse s , too .",

    "each of them again fulfills its own dse .",

    "we have used a small cut - off , . however , the solutions do not depend on a further increasement of @xmath157 as the chiral symmetric solutions do not display the scaling behavior  ( [ scaling ] ) as in the case of the nambu - goldstone phase",
    ". the numerical error in fig .",
    "6 is about 1% to 5% ; it is largest close to the imaginary axis .",
    "it is obvious that for all the angles  @xmath156 the real parts  @xmath152 at zero momentum ( ) are identical ; the imaginary parts   which are not shown vanish for small momenta within the numerical accuracy .",
    "for the iteration of eq .",
    "( [ atriv ] ) does not converge due to the ( integrable ) singularities of the gluon propagator .",
    "nevertheless there is no signature of any further non - analyticity close to the imaginary axis .",
    "we therefore conclude that there is a strong indication for the vector part of the quark self energy being analytic .",
    "then the quark propagator has only one pole , namely the one at .    in the nambu - goldstone phase , , the integral kernels @xmath147 and @xmath148 from eqs .",
    "( [ fa ] ) and ( [ fb ] ) are not holomorphic on the whole complex momentum plane either .",
    "there has to be a pole contribution from the contour integration in eq .",
    "( [ ana ] ) . as the angular integrals over @xmath57 and @xmath58 do not carry a pole singularity the scalar and the vector parts of the quark propagator have at least one pole .",
    "if this singularity is not lying on the real axis but within the complex plane the wick rotation can not be performed navely . if it is placed on the timelike axis the nave wick rotation is allowed as long as the causal behavior of the quark propagator is suitably determined .",
    "we have not found any singularities except the kinematical ones and the mass pole on the real axis .",
    "even though we are not able to draw compulsory conclusions this numerical result strongly indicates that the quark propagator is analytic within the whole complex momentum plane except on the real timelike axis .",
    "this statement is also supported by the analysis within different dse models @xcite where it is found that poles of the quark propagators are lying quite close to the real axis .",
    "in addition , the analyticity condition  ( [ zeitloes ] ) is quite easily understood from a physical point of view . under the action of the wick rotation",
    "the euclidean mass term becomes times the corresponding minkowski term , a kinetic fermionic term keeps `` unmodified '' . in terms of the quark propagator functions",
    "this reads : @xmath158 where denotes the euclidean and the corresponding minkowski four momentum squared close to a mass pole of the quark propagator . in minkowski space",
    "we therefore just recover one of the `` solutions ''  ( [ zeitloes ] ) which is not surprising .    summarizing this section",
    ", there are strong indications that the euclidean quark propagator of the dse model specified by the gluon exchange  ( [ stingl ] ) can be continued back to minkowski space . within a small region around the mass pole  ( [ mc ] )",
    "the minkowskian quark propagator has a klln - lehmann representation and it therefore resembles the propagator of a massive stable fermion . for a restricted set of parameters we have been able to verify this numerically .",
    "due to the numerical problems associated with the kinematical singularities we are not really able to prove this statement rigorously for all values of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , it is the most plausible conclusion drawn from the properties of the functions  @xmath147 and @xmath148 as discussed in this section .",
    "we have investigated the euclidean dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the quark self energy for an infrared vanishing gluon propagator in rainbow approximation .",
    "we have found that this model is not appropriate for describing hadron phenomenology due to several reasons .",
    "first , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) occurs either for unphysically large coupling constants only or for a small ir scale , @xmath159 .",
    "the strength and the scale of dcsb are then independent of @xmath0 : the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry is mainly driven by the term added to obtain the correct uv behavior and _ not _ by the infrared part .",
    "in addition , continuation to timelike momenta reveals that the quark propagator possesses a pole . as our numerical method",
    "is only reliable for ir mass scale parameters @xmath0 larger than the created dynamical quark mass ( see the discussion in subsection  [ subsecmass ] ) this pole can be unambigously identified for such values of @xmath0 only . to be explicit , we do not claim that there is no pole , we only state that within our method it can not be found even if it exists .",
    "however , the occurrence of a mass pole in the propagator can be related to the propagation of a stable particle .",
    "therefore it is clear that quarks are not confined in this model , at least for a large range of the ir parameter  @xmath0 .",
    "this is in contradiction to results obtained in ref .",
    "there heavy quarkonia have been studied using a non - relativistic reduction of the gluon propagator  ( [ stingl ] ) together with a quark propagator and a quark - gluon vertex which result from the dse studies of ref .",
    ". however , in this work the quark - quark interaction  ( [ stingl ] ) has been replaced by a coulomb potential .",
    "the resulting equation for the quarkonium bound states is just a lippmann - schwinger equation for hydrogen with the exception that the non  trivial quark propagators of ref .",
    "@xcite have been used .",
    "these propagators are then probably the reason for the `` confining mechanism '' described in ref .",
    ". stated otherwise , the unusual behavior of the quarks have been put in `` by hand '' . such a mechanism is not supported by our calculations .    instead , our results are in accordance with those of hawes et al .",
    "@xcite who have studied the quark propagator for spacelike momenta only and have extracted the quark mass from the large time behavior of the schwinger functions .",
    "additionally , they have used non - trivial quark - gluon vertices .",
    "the good quantitative agreement of our results with those of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the rainbow approximation is a good approximation for this model interaction .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the influence of a non - trivial quark - gluon vertex is concentrated in the infrared which for the studied case is suppressed by the infrared vanishing gluon exchange .",
    "even though a study of the analyticity of the quark propagator is hampered by numerical difficulties we have found convincing evidence for the quark propagator being analytic within the whole complex euclidean momentum plane except the timelike ( negative real ) axis .",
    "this has two consequences : first , it is possible to perform the nave wick rotation .",
    "second , and more important , the model does _ not _ lead to quark confinement .",
