    "recently , the perovskite - type oxides , which display ferroelectric and magnetic properties , have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in multifunctional magnetoelectric devices@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath1 is a good candidate which exhibits the coexistence of ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic orders with high curie temperature@xcite and n@xmath2el temperature@xcite .",
    "numerous studies have been performed on @xmath1 samples and especially , more recently , on thin films . generally , bottom and top electrodes are fabricated to form a capacitor configuration for ferroelectric measurements .",
    "the physical origin of the interfacial layer has been proposed to be process - induced domain evolution or the effect of lattice misfit between the electrode and surface of the film .",
    "the interfaces in @xmath1 film capacitors have already been verified by using x - ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscope high - angle annular dark - field imaging@xcite , and the effect of the interface on the dielectric behavior of @xmath1 film capacitor was also investigated in experiment@xcite . for epitaxial system ,",
    "the substrate - induced strains have been proven to have great influence on the ferroelectric properties of ferroelectric material@xcite .",
    "the previous studies show that substrate - induced strains can lead to a substantial increase in spontaneous polarization for bfo films@xcite .",
    "the mechanical substrate effects and thickness dependence of ferroelectric properties in epitaxial bfo films are investigated within the framework of landau - devonshire theory .",
    "although the interface between the electrode and the bfo layer has been reported in experiment@xcite , there is no theoretical investigation of the interfacial effect on the polarization of bfo film . in this paper ,",
    "the interfaces between electrode and @xmath1 layer are considered with different film thickness .",
    "it is found that the interface will have great influence on the polarization and the hysteresis behavior of ultrathin @xmath1 films . due to the interfacial effect ,",
    "the maximum polarization on the p - e loop of thin film can be lower(or higher ) than that of thickness film , and the maximum polarization can also be thickness - independent through the competition between the interfacial effect and the compressive stress under an adequate applied field .",
    "here , we consider a @xmath1 film grown on @xmath3 substrate with a bottom @xmath4 electrode and a top @xmath5 electrode@xcite . it is known that there is a clear and sharp interface between @xmath1 layer and the bottom @xmath4 electrode , and a rough , inter - diffused interface between @xmath1 layer and the top @xmath5 electrode , which can be confirmed by the cross - section hr - tem image@xcite .",
    "it is reasonable that the interface between bfo and the bottom electrode can be neglected for simplicity .",
    "therefore , we simulate the @xmath1 film by a ferroelectric layer with a top non - switching interface , and investigate the effects of the interface on the p - e loop with different film thickness . the electric displacement across bfo layer is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the permittivity , the local electric field and the spontaneous polarization of bfo layer , respectively .",
    "the electric displacement across the interface is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 stand for the permittivity and the local electric field of interface .",
    "the applied field @xmath13 can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the thickness ratio of interface .",
    "the continuity of the total current density across the film can be expressed as @xmath16 combining eq .",
    "( 1 ) with eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath17e_{f}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + [ v(\\epsilon_{f}+\\chi_{f})+\\epsilon_{in}(1-v)]\\dot{e}_{f},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the conductivities of top interface and @xmath1 layer , respectively , @xmath20 is the electric susceptibility of @xmath1 layer , which equals @xmath21@xcite @xmath22\\}^{-1},\\\\ \\delta&=&e_{c}[log(\\frac{1+p_{fr}/p_{fs}}{1-p_{fr}/p_{fs}})]^{-1},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote the remanent polarization , saturate polarization and coercive field of @xmath1 layer , respectively , which can be determined through landau - devonshire theory@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 films with different thickness are supposed to grow on ( 001)-oriented @xmath3 substrate . a tetragonal structure of @xmath1 thin film based on cubic perovskite structure with symmetry lowered to p4mm(neglect the small monoclinic distortion of about @xmath26 of c axis )",
    "is suggested with an elongated c axis@xcite .",
    "the polarization for such a single phase is along with @xmath27 axis .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of pseudo cubic @xmath1 film is expressed as the function of magnetization @xmath28 , polarization @xmath9 , temperature @xmath29 and misfit strain @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the in - plane lattice parameter for substrate and @xmath32 is the equivalent cubic lattice constant of free standing film .",
    "we do not include the magnetic effect and the coupling between magnetic order and ferroelectric order , owing to a relative weak magnetic order compared to the stronger ferroelectric one .",
    "the thermodynamic potential of @xmath1 layer can be written as following , @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the electrostricitive coefficient , @xmath37 is the elastic compliances , and the dielectric stiffness coefficient @xmath38 .",
    "the equilibrium state polarization @xmath9 under a local field @xmath8 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) can be numerically resolved from eq .",
    "( 5 ) by @xmath39 , @xmath40 in order to introduce the misfit strain into the epitaxial @xmath1 film , an effective substrate lattice parameter @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 , which is used to calculate the misfit strain @xmath43 instead of actual substrate lattice parameter @xmath31 , and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 is the equilibrium linear misfit dislocation density at the deposition temperature @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the critical film thickness corresponding to the generation of misfit dislocation .",
    "all the coefficients in landau expansion used in this letter are given in ref .",
    "from eq .  ( 6 ) , we calculate the spontaneous polarization @xmath9 without considering the interface . the hysteresis behavior of the single @xmath1 layer is shown in fig .  1 , where solid line stands for the hysteresis loop of the 77-nm - thick film , and dotted line for the 960-nm - thick film .",
    "the remanent polarization of the @xmath49 nm @xmath1 film is @xmath50 , which is close to the polarization of single crystal@xcite .",
    "we can see that the spontaneous polarization increases as the thickness decreases , and our results are qualitatively consistent with previous theoretical works@xcite .",
    "it is obviously that the compressive stress between @xmath1 layer and substrate @xmath3 will remarkable increase the polarization , and the spontaneous polarization @xmath9 will increase with the decrease of thickness .",
    "however , as observed by afm@xcite and simulated by the capacitor configuration@xcite , there really exists an interface between top electrode and @xmath1 layer .",
    "so , the measured polarization is not the polarization of a single ferroelectric layer . in the following",
    ", an interface between the top @xmath5 electrode and @xmath1 layer is introduced , and two @xmath1 film samples of thickness @xmath51 nm and @xmath49 nm are selected in our simulation@xcite .",
    "the dielectric constant and the conductivity of the @xmath1 layer are selected as 100@xcite and @xmath52@xcite , respectively . due to the interface",
    "is formed between the metal material and @xmath1 layer , we assume its conductivity and dielectric constant take the values of @xmath53@xcite and @xmath54 .",
    "the thickness of interface is introduced by taking into account the thickness ratio of interface to @xmath1 layer .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 will increase as the decrease of film thickness , and the ratios @xmath55 are taken as @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the two samples .    for a given sinusoidal field @xmath13",
    ", the effective field @xmath8 can be calculated from eq .",
    "( 3 ) as a function of time @xmath58 . then the polarization @xmath9 at the @xmath59th increment in time",
    "is calculated by using @xmath60 .",
    "the simulated hysteresis loops corresponding to different applied fields are shown in fig .  2 , the frequency of the applied field in our simulation is @xmath61khz .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "2 denote the loops of 77-nm - thick film , and the dotted lines stand for the loops of 960-nm - thick film . from fig .",
    "2(a ) to ( d ) , the maximum field are selected as @xmath62 mv / cm , @xmath63 mv / cm , @xmath64 mv / cm and @xmath65 mv / cm , respectively . by taking into account the interface ,",
    "the local field @xmath8 will decrease as the decrease of thickness under the same applied field .",
    "for the 960-nm - thick film , due to the small proportion of the interface component , the local field @xmath8 is close to the applied field , and the p - e loop is already saturated in fig .",
    "2(a ) , whereas the p - e loop for 77-nm - thick film does not saturated , and the maximum polarization on the p - e loop is smaller than the saturated polarization of 960-nm - thick film .",
    "one can see , from fig .  1 and fig .",
    "2(a ) , that the interface will great suppress the polarization of the ultrathin film , and the interfacial effect of an ultrathin film is more important than the internal stress effect under a low applied field .",
    "for a selected applied field @xmath66=@xmath63",
    "mv / cm in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the maximum polarization on the p - e loop is independent on the thickness of the film , which is the consequence of the competition between the interfacial effect and the internal compressive stress effect . in fig .",
    "2(c ) , the maximum polarization of the ultrathin film is larger than that of the thick film , which had also been observed in experiment(see fig .",
    "4(d ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and it shows that the interfacial effect is less dominant for the ultrathin film under a high applied field . as further increasing the maximum field ,",
    "the polarizations for the two samples are both saturated , and the saturated polarization of the 77-nm - thick film is larger than that of the 960-nm - thick film . in addition , the p - e loops for materials such as @xmath1 film are often dominated by leakage current , and the saturated p - e curve in fig .",
    "2(d ) for an ultrathin film can only be observed for samples with high resistivity and high breakdown field .        in summary",
    ", the epitaxial @xmath67 film is simulated by a multilayer model which takes the effect of interface .",
    "it is found that the existence of interfacial layer will increase the coercive field , and change the shape of the p - e loop , especially for an ultrathin film .",
    "the p - e loop will become more slant for the ultrathin film , which is resulted from the decreasing of the effective field in @xmath1 layer . for different maximum fields ,",
    "the maximum polarization of the ultrathin film can be smaller(or larger ) than that of the thick film . for an adequate applied field ,",
    "the maximum polarization on the p - e loop could be thickness - independent , and the origin is caused by the competition between the interfacial effect and the internal compressive stress .",
    "it is concluded that the effect of interface between the electrode and @xmath1 layer has great influence on the polarization of @xmath1 film .",
    "when measuring the saturated p - e loops for multiferroic ultrathin films with metal contacts , one should apply a field large enough to saturate the polarization .",
