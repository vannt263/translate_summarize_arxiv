    "lee and lee ( 2004 ) consider a global monopole as a candidate for the galactic dark matter riddle and solve the einstein equations in the weak field and large @xmath0 approximations , for the case of scalar tensor gravity ( where @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the bare gravitational constant ) .",
    "the potential of the triplet of the scalar field is written as : @xmath3 , the line element of the spherically symmetric static spacetime results as : @xmath4 where the functions @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are given in their eq .",
    "19 . from the above , lee and lee ( 2004 )",
    "write the geodesic equations , whose solution , for circular motions , reads : @xmath8    -0.7truecm    where @xmath9 is the ordinary stellar mass distribution . in the above equation , they interpret the first ( constant ) term , that emerges in addition to the standard keplerian term , as the alleged constant ( flat ) value @xmath10 that the circular velocities are thought to asymptotically reach in the external regions of galaxies , where the ( baryonic ) matter contribution @xmath11 has decreased from the peak value by a factor of several .",
    "furthermore , they compare the quantity @xmath12 with the spiral circular velocities at outer radii and estimate : @xmath13 . the crucial features of their theory ( at the current stage ) are : the `` dm phenomenon '' always emerges at outer radii @xmath0 of a galaxy as a constant threshold value below which the circular velocity @xmath14 can not decrease , regardless of the distance between @xmath0 and the location of the bulk of the stellar component .",
    "the theory implies ( or , at its present stage , seems to imply ) the existence of an observational scenario in which the rotation curves of spirals are asymptotically flat and the new extra - newtonian ( constant ) quantity appearing in the modified equation of motion , can be derived from the rotation curves themselves . as a result",
    ", the flatness of a rc becomes a main imprint for the nature of the `` dark matter constituent '' .",
    "the aim of this comment is to show that the above `` paradigm of flat rotation curves '' of spiral galaxies ( frc ) has no observational support , and to present its inconsistency by means of factual evidence .",
    "let us notice that we could have listed a number of objects with a serious gravitating _",
    "vs. _ luminous mass discrepancy having steep ( and not flat ) rc s and that only a minority of the observed rotation curves can be considered as flat in the outer parts of spirals .",
    "however , we think that it is worth to discuss in detail the phenomenology of the spirals rc s , in that we believe that it is the benchmark of any ( traditional or innovative ) work on `` galactic dark matter '' , including that of lee and lee ( 2004 ) .",
    "the `` phenomenon of dark matter '' was discovered in the late 70 s ( bosma 1981 , rubin et al .",
    "1980 ) as the lack of the keplerian fall - off in the circular velocity of spiral galaxies , expected beyond their stellar edges @xmath15 ( taken as 3.2 stellar disk exponential scale - lengths @xmath16 ) . in the early years of the discovery",
    "two facts led to the concept of flat rotation curves :    \\1 ) large part of the evidence for dm was provided by extended , low - resolution hi rc s of very luminous spirals ( e.g. bosma 1981 ) whose velocity profile did show small radial variations .",
    "2 ) highlighting the few truly flat rotation curves was considered a way to rule out the claim that non keplerian velocity profiles originate from a faint baryonic component distributed at large radii .",
    "it was soon realized that hi rc s of high - resolution and/or of galaxies of low luminosity did vary with radius , that baryonic ( dark ) matter was not a plausible candidate for the cosmological dm , and finally , the prevailing cosmological scenario ( cold dark matter ) did predict galaxy halos with rising as well as with declining rotation curves ( navarro , frenk and white , 1996 ) .",
    "the frc paradigm was dismissed by researchers in galaxy kinematics in the early 90 s ( persic et al .",
    "1988 , ashman , 1992 ) , and later by cosmologists ( e.g. weinberg , 1997 ) . today",
    ", the structure of the dm halos and their rotation speeds is thought to have a central role in cosmology and a strong link to elementary particles via the nature of their constituents , ( e.g. olive 2005 ) and a careful interpretation of the spirals rc s is considered crucial .",
    "let us stress that a frc is not a proof of the existence of dark matter in a galaxy . in fact , the circular velocity due to a freeman stellar disk has a flattish profile between 2 and 3 disk scale - lengths .",
    "instead , the evidence in spirals of a serious mass discrepancy , that we interpret as the effect of a dark halo enveloping the stellar disk , originates from the fact that , in their optical regions , the rc are often steeply rising .",
    "let us quantify the above statement by plotting the average value of the rc logarithmic slope , @xmath17 between two and three disk scale - lengths as a function of the rotation speed @xmath18 at the disk edge @xmath15 .",
    "we remind that , at 3 @xmath16 in the case of no - dm self - gravitating freeman disk , @xmath19 in any object , and that in the lee and lee proposal @xmath20 ( see eq .",
    "1 ) .    we consider the sample of 130 individual and 1000 coadded rc s of normal spirals , presented in persic , salucci & stel ( 1996 ) ( pss ) .",
    "we find ( see fig .",
    "1b ) : @xmath21 ( r.m.s . = 0.1 ) , where @xmath22 . a similarly tight relation links @xmath23 with the galaxy absolute magnitude ( see fig .",
    "for dwarfs , with @xmath24 , we take the results by swaters ( 1999 ) : @xmath25 ( r.m.s .",
    "= 0.2 ) that results in good agreement with the extrapolation of eq .",
    "the _ large range _ in @xmath23 and the high values of these quantities , implied by eq . 2 and evident in fig . 1 , are confirmed by other studies of independent samples ( e.g. courteau 1997 , see fig .",
    "14 and vogt et al .",
    "2004 , see figures inside ) .",
    "therefore , in disk systems , in region where the stars reside , the rc slope takes values in the range : @xmath26 i.e. it covers most of the range that a circular velocity slope could take ( -0.5 ( keplerian ) , 1 ( solid body ) ) .",
    "let us notice that the difference between the rc slopes and the no - dm case is almost as severe as the difference between the former and the alleged value of zero .",
    "it is apparent that only a very minor fraction of rc s can be considered as flat .",
    "its rough estimate can be derived in simple way . at luminosities @xmath27 ,",
    "( @xmath28 is the knee of the luminosity function in the b - band ) the spiral luminosity function can be assumed as a power law : @xmath29 , then , by means of the tully - fisher relationship @xmath30 ( giovanelli et al . , 1997 ) combined with eq .",
    "2a , one gets : @xmath31 finding that the objects with a solid - body rc ( @xmath32 ) are one order of magnitude more numerous than those with a `` flat '' rc ( @xmath33 ) . in short , there is plenty of evidence of galaxies whose inner regions show a very steep rc , that in the newtonian + dark matter halos framework , implies that they are dominated by a dark component , with a density profile much shallower than the `` canonical '' @xmath34 one .",
    "-0.3truecm    at outer radii ( between 6 - 10 disk scale - lengths ) the observational data are obviously more scanty , however , we observe a varied and systematics zoo of rising , flat , and declining rc s profiles ( gentile et al .",
    "2004 ; donato et al .",
    "the evidence from about 2000 rc s of normal and dwarf spirals unambiguously shows the existence of a systematics in the rotation curve profiles inconsistent with the flat rotation curve paradigm . the non stellar term in eq .",
    "1 must have a radial dependence in each galaxy and vary among galaxies . to show this",
    "let us summarize the rc systematics .",
    "in general , a rotation curve of a spiral , out to 6 disk scale - lengths , is well described by the following function : @xmath35\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the normalized radius , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are free parameters , @xmath40 is the contribution of the stellar disk at @xmath15 and @xmath41 is the core radius of the dark matter distribution . using a sample of @xmath42 1000 galaxies , pss found that , out to the farthest radii with available data , i.e. out to @xmath43 , the luminosity specifies the above free parameters i.e. the main average properties of the axisymmetric rotation field of spirals and , therefore , of the related mass distribution . in detail ,",
    "2 becomes the expression for the _ universal rotation curve _",
    "( urc , see fig . 2 and pss for important details ) .",
    "thus , for a galaxy of luminosity @xmath44 ( b - band ) and normalized radius @xmath45 we have ( see also rhee , 1996 ) : @xmath46 -0.85truecm @xmath47   { x^2 \\over",
    "x^2 + 2.25\\,({l\\over l_*})^{0.4 } } \\biggr]^{1/2}\\ ] ] the above can be written as : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the halo mass inside @xmath15 and k of the order of unity .",
    "then , differently from the lee and lee ( 2004 ) claim and the frc paradigm , the `` dark '' contribution @xmath50 to the rc varies with radius , namely as @xmath51 , @xmath52 in each object . finally ,",
    "also the extrapolated `` asymptotic amplitude @xmath53 '' varies , according to the galaxy luminosity , between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( see also pss ) in disagreement with the lee and lee ( 2004 ) predicted constant value of @xmath56 .",
    "let us conclude with an _ important _ point : this paper is not intended to discourage testing out whether a theory , alternative to the dm paradigm , can account for an outer flat rotation curve , but to make us sure that this is the ( simplest ) first step of a project meant to account for the actual complex phenomenology of rotation curves of spirals and of the implied physical relevance of the mass discrepancy ( e.g. gentile et al .",
