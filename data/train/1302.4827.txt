    "in addition , it has been argued that critical fm fluctuations near a quantum phase transition could mediate spin - triplet superconductivity  @xcite , and actually , ( iv ) in the above indicates that the superconductivity in ucoge is intimately coupled with the ising fm spin fluctuations .",

    "we show , from model calculations on the basis of the scenario of fm spin fluctuation - mediated superconductivity in ucoge , that unconventional temperature and angle dependence of @xmath3 is consistently understood by adopting the characteristic longitudinal fm fluctuations revealed experimentally . besides , by comparing calculations for possible pairing states , we also discuss candidates of sc gap symmetries in ucoge .",
    "in this section , we introduce a simple model to study @xmath3 in ucoge at ambient pressure where the ferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist . although ucoge has a complicated multi - band structure , since the spin fluctuations dominate the low energy physics in ucoge , we can use a simplified model to study its superconductivity with appropriately taking into account the critical fm spin fluctuations observed in the experiments  @xcite .",

    "a typical energy scale of the quasiparticles is @xmath47 ( k ) estimated from the specific heat  @xcite and the coherence temperature  @xcite . since the anisotropy in the resistivity in ucoge is small as discussed in the introduction , we use an isotropic dispersion @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the lattice constant and @xmath6 is the chemical potential .",
    "we fix the electron density per site as @xmath50 which leads to a small but nearly spherical fermi surface .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , the anisotropic mass model can not explain the anomalous angle dependence of @xmath3 . in our model ,",
    "the anisotropy in @xmath3 arises from the exchange term and the pairing interaction term in eq.([eq : action ] ) .",
    "we use an energy unit @xmath51 and a length unit @xmath52 .    the second term of eq.([eq : action ] )",
    "includes the exchange splitting of the fermi surface in the fm phase which is assumed to be large compared to the sc transition temperature at zero - field @xmath53 .",
    "the exchange field is parallel to the @xmath26-axis and fixed to be @xmath54 , which would lead to suppression of the pauli depairing effect against in - plane magnetic fields in the equal spin pairing states of the superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "this is a key assumption to understand the large anisotropy in @xmath3 in the present study , because the equal spin pairing states are not robust against the in - plane zeeman field while the observed @xmath55 are huge in ucoge .",
    "however , we put a remark on this assumption .",
    "ucoge has a multi - band structure with a strong spin - orbit interaction and 5@xmath56 states are located near the fermi level . in such a system , it is possible that , even if the magnetization in the fm state is small , the exchange splitting for each fermi surface is large . actually , in the band calculations , the orbital magnetizations and the spin polarizations cancel to result in a small total magnetic moment .",
    "the present assumption can be checked by nmr knight shift measurements in the sc states .    finally , the last term in eq .",

    "although the origin of this magnetic field dependence in the susceptibility is not so clear , we have a possible explanation for it . according to the band calculation ,",
    "the 5@xmath56 bands in ucoge have some semi - metallic like structures around several @xmath66-points  @xcite . for such structures ,",
    "the density of states would be @xmath67 , which results in @xmath68 near the criticality . in this scenario ,",
    "detailed structures in the bands are important , and therefore , the spin fluctuations in ucoge under a magnetic field can depend on sample qualities .",
    "this problem will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we note that the coupling constant @xmath69 should be regarded as a renormalized one including the vertex corrections which enhance the sc transition temperatures .",
    "although we have postulated a simple analytic @xmath70-dependence in @xmath71 , there might exist non - analytic corrections @xmath72 in 3-dimensional isotropic systems @xcite .",
    "the non - analytic corrections are important in connection with fluctuation - induced first order phase transitions . however , since the first order character of the fm transition is weak , and critical fm fluctuations are well developed in ucoge as discussed in sec.[sec : intro ] , it would be legitimate to neglect the first order character , and assume that @xmath71 is analytic in @xmath70 as long as calculations of the superconducting properties are concerned .",
    "in addition , if exist in the ising - like system , the non - analytic corrections would not change the present study qualitatively as discussed in  @xcite .      in this study , we focus on the anisotropy between the @xmath24 and @xmath26-axes upper critical fields ( @xmath73 and @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , it was reported that the @xmath25-axis upper critical field @xmath74 shows a `` s - shaped '' curve at high fields , and relations to the reentrant superconductivity in urhge were discussed  @xcite . in urhge , the magnetization flips at a critical @xmath75 and the spin fluctuations at @xmath76 are considered to be different from those of @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "similar scenarios are expected to hold also in ucoge where the s - shaped @xmath74 would indicate a crossover of the superconductivities of different mechanisms under magnetic field along the @xmath25 axis .",
    "the problem of @xmath74 in ucoge is an another issue and will be studied elsewhere .    to determine the upper critical field @xmath3 in the @xmath78-plane , we solve the linearized eliashberg equation in the presence of a vector potential  @xcite .",

    "a short notation @xmath82 is used hereafter .",

    "the gap function depends both on the momentum in the relative coordinate and the center - of - mass coordinate , and is expanded as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the lowest level landau function .",
    "we solve the linearized eliashberg equation for two cases corresponding to the classification by the magnetic point group @xmath87 for ucoge which has an orthorhombic crystal structure  @xcite .",

    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 are real coefficients .",
    "both of the gap functions are determined by self consistent calculations , and the resulting sc states are non - unitary because of the presence of the exchange field @xmath94 .",
    "we note that , under the applied magnetic field @xmath43 , the calculated gap functions are distorted and has lower symmetry than that of the cubic lattice in the present model .",

    "other neglected terms in the self energy are much smaller than @xmath99 in magnitude .",
    "as noted in the previous section , the coupling constant @xmath69 is a renormalized one .",
    "in the present study , the coupling constant is fixed as @xmath100 which is rather large to give a high transition temperature so that the numerical costs are reduced .",
    "however , qualitatively , our main results do not depend on the value of @xmath95 .",
    "for this value of @xmath95 , the mass enhancement factor @xmath101 is @xmath102 , which is not so large because the density of states at the fermi surface is small in the present parameters .",
    "the transition temperature for the a state without magnetic field is @xmath103 which we regard as 1.0 k according to the experiments for ucoge .",
    "then , the hopping integral is fixed as @xmath104 k throughout in our study , and the order of this value is consistent with the coefficient of the linear specific heat @xmath105 mj / k@xmath106mol  @xcite and the coherence temperature @xmath107 k  @xcite .",
    "we also fix the lattice constant , @xmath108 which leads to an effective mass for the orbital motion of the cooper pairs @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the bare electron mass .",
    "correspondingly , we fix @xmath111 t , which is consistent with the nmr experiments  @xcite .      before discussing numerical results of @xmath3 of the present model",
    ", we note that the orbital limit @xmath112 depends on positions of gap nodes in general  @xcite .",
    "a simple explanation is as follows .",
    "let us consider a superconductor with isotropic fermi surface which has nodes in a gap function .",
    "the effective velocity for the cyclotron motion of the orbital depairing effect can be of the form of @xmath113 for the basis function @xmath114 corresponding to the sc gap symmetry , where @xmath115 is a velocity of electrons . for @xmath114 with horizontal line nodes , when the magnetic field is parallel to the @xmath26-axis , the cyclotron motion is suppressed at the nodes where in - plane @xmath116 is zero , resulting in a large orbital limiting field .",
    "the cyclotron motion is not suppressed for @xmath117 because @xmath118 is non - zero on the fermi surface , which leads to the anisotropy of the orbital limiting field @xmath119 .",
    "on the other hand , for the point node gap function , @xmath116 can not be zero except for the poles of the fermi surface @xmath120 which are realized as cross points of two line nodes @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , for point nodes at the poles of the fermi surface , the order is turned over , @xmath123 . following this consideration ,",
    "if there is no suppression of the pairing interaction and the pauli depairing effect is negligible , @xmath124 is expected for the a ( b ) state .",
    "we now turn to discussions of calculation results .",
    "temperature dependence of @xmath125 with @xmath126 for the a state is shown in fig .",

    "@xmath73 exhibits a strong coupling behavior and reaches @xmath128 .",
    "although the precise value of @xmath129 depends on the choice of @xmath130 and @xmath95 , strong coupling calculations of @xmath3 naturally explain the upward curvature in @xmath73 and its large value observed in the experiments , which is a key to understand the anomalous anisotropic behavior in @xmath3 .",
    "the calculated anisotropy ratio @xmath131 becomes @xmath132 in consistent with the experiments , although the fermi surface of our model is merely spherical .",
    "we emphasize that , for @xmath3 to have a large anisotropy between the @xmath24 and @xmath26-axes , the experimentally observed @xmath133-dependence in the susceptibility is crucially important .",

    "<S> identification of pairing mechanisms leading to the unconventional superconductivity realized in copper - oxide , heavy - fermions , and organic compounds is one of the most challenging issues in condensed - matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> clear evidence for an electron - phonon mechanism in conventional superconductors is seen by the isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperatures @xmath0 , since isotopic substitution varies the phonon frequency without affecting the electronic states . in unconventional superconductors , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fluctuations have been proposed to mediate superconductivity , and considerable efforts have been made to unravel relationships between normal - state magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity . here , we show that characteristic experimental results on the ferromagnetic ( fm ) superconductor ucoge ( @xmath1 k and @xmath2 k ) can be understood consistently within a scenario of the spin - triplet superconductivity induced by fm spin fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> temperature and angle dependencies of the upper critical magnetic field of the superconductivity ( @xmath3 ) are calculated on the basis of the above scenario by solving the eliashberg equation . </S>",
    "<S> calculated @xmath3 well agrees with the characteristic experimental results observed in ucoge . </S>",
    "<S> this is a first example that fm fluctuations are shown to be a pairing glue of superconductivity . </S>"
