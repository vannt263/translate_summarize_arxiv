    "the physics program at cleo is at the forefront of heavy flavour research .",
    "the emphasis is on the decay of charm hadrons , beauty mesons and tau leptons .",
    "there is also active research in 2-photon physics , upsilon spectroscopy and production characteristics of charm hadrons .    in this talk ,",
    "i will focus on the disagreement between the experimental value of the b semileptonic branching fraction and predictions of theoretical models ; the experimental value being the smaller of the two . in order to `` fix '' the model predictions ,",
    "one has to increase the number of charm quarks produced in the decay of a b quark , and also the rate for b decays of the type , @xmath0 .",
    "i will discuss cleo results which shed light on this issue .",
    "i will first present results on an isospin violating decay of the @xmath1 meson .",
    "the results shown here are based on data taken at the cornell electron storage ring using the cleo - ii detector .",
    "the cleo - ii detector has excellent charged and neutral particle detection over @xmath2 of @xmath3 .",
    "electrons and muons are detected with high efficiency and low fake rates .",
    "detector details can be found elsewhere@xcite .",
    "the data were collected on the @xmath4(4s ) resonance , with center of mass energy of 10.58 gev , and in the continuum , 60 mev below .",
    "the on resonance luminosity was 3.3 fb@xmath5 , which corresponds to about @xmath6 @xmath7 mesons produced .",
    "the off resonance luminosity , which is used to model the continuum background under the @xmath4(4s ) , was 1.6 fb@xmath5 . to study charm hadrons",
    ", one can use both on and off resonance data , which amounts to about @xmath8 @xmath9 pairs produced . the total number of reconstructed charm hadrons at present , which includes @xmath10 , etc .",
    ", is @xmath11 .",
    "the results presented here are based on about 70% of the total luminosity .",
    "up to now , only the radiative decay of the @xmath1 has been observed@xcite .",
    "the only strong decay allowed , @xmath12 , is `` forbidden '' by isospin .",
    "however , isospin is not an exact symmetry , e.g. , @xmath13 , and the presence of the decay @xmath14 .",
    "it has been argued on the basis of chiral perturbation theory that @xmath12 is non - vanishing .",
    "the decay is mediated by a virtual @xmath15 , which has a significant @xmath16 content , which then `` mixes '' into a @xmath17 , due to the fact that the former also has a large non - strange component .",
    "the second step violates isospin .",
    "the tree level diagram for this decay , gluon emission to produce a @xmath17 , is ozi - suppressed , whereas the electromagnetic production mechanism is down by a factor of @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude for this decay mode is proportional to the mass difference between the u and d quarks . since the radiative decay , @xmath19 , is suppressed due to the partial cancellation of the charm and strange quark magnetic moments , it is possible to observe the isospin violating decay .",
    "the @xmath20 meson is reconstructed in the @xmath21 decay mode , which has a large ( detection efficiency @xmath22 branching fraction ) and is relatively background free@xcite .",
    "the @xmath17 has to pass strict selection criteria in order to be considered . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pizero ] , i present the mass difference , @xmath23 , for events which fall within the @xmath17 and @xmath20 mass regions .",
    "the points with error bars indicate a clear signal , yielding @xmath24 events .",
    "the dashed line is the contribution due to random combinations , which has been modelled using the sidebands in the @xmath17 and @xmath20 mass distributions .",
    "a fit to the dashed histogram yields @xmath25 events , consistent with zero . if , instead , we plot the @xmath20 mass , after requiring cuts on the mass difference , we again have a clear signal .",
    "counting events in the signal region , 142  mev / c@xmath26  mev / c@xmath27 , we observe 16 signal and 5 background events .",
    "taking into account that the sidebands are twice the width of the signal region , we obtain the binomial probability of getting 16 ( or more ) signal events out of a total of 21 events to be @xmath28 , which corresponds to a statistical significance of at least 3.9 standard deviations . normalizing this reaction to the radiative decay",
    ", we obtain the branching fraction ratio ,    @xmath29    the presence of both the radiative and pionic decay modes implies that the spin - parity of the @xmath1 belongs to the `` natural '' series ( @xmath30 , 2@xmath31 , ... ) .",
    "the most likely scenario is @xmath30 , same as @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the pionic decay mode is very close to the kinematic threshold ; we use it to measure the mass difference of @xmath1 and @xmath20 , which is determined to be @xmath34 mev / c@xmath27 , in excellent agreement with the previous cleo measurement ( using the radiative mode ) , @xmath35 mev / c@xmath27 .",
    "these values are somewhat larger but more precise than the pdg@xcite value of @xmath36 mev / c@xmath27 .",
    "one of the more intriguing issues in b physics is the disagreement between the experimental value and theoretical predictions for the b semileptonic branching fraction . after accounting for qcd corrections ,",
    "the theoretical predictions range from @xmath37 , whereas the most model independent experimental value ( cleo ) is @xmath38 .",
    "this `` disagreement '' may not seem real , but the problem is that these theoretical models also predict that the number of charm quarks ( @xmath39 ) produced per decay of a b quark is about 1.30 instead of the measured value ( cleo ) , @xmath40 these predictions imply that the rate of the @xmath0 transition is boosted from 0.15 to about 0.30 ; the lower the theoretical prediction for @xmath41 , the higher the prediction for @xmath39 and @xmath42 .",

    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from these yields , the ratio of the relative strengths of @xmath0 and @xmath43 transitions in @xmath44 decays is determined to be , @xmath45 nowhere near @xmath46 , which is what one may expect if @xmath47 applied universally to all b decays .",
    "in addition , this result is consistent with the ratio being @xmath48 , which is what one expects from naive phase - space arguments .",
    "however , to have a more conclusive result , we need more data , more techniques of tagging the flavour of one b.    @xmath49 is another decay mode where one can probe the importance of the @xmath0 transition .",
    "this decay mainly occurs via the internal w diagram with the @xmath50 accompanied by @xmath51 popping as in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn]b or @xmath52 accompanied by light quark - pair popping , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn]d , respectively .",

    "[ fig : feyn]a .",
    "if @xmath53 \\approx 1/3 $ ] and the ratio of @xmath51 to light quark - pair popping is about 0.15 , then one could expect the ratio , @xmath54 .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath55 in the @xmath56 modes , respectively .",
    "the on ( data points ) and off ( shaded ) resonance contributions to @xmath57 and @xmath58 mass distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : csc0 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : cscp ] , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath59 events for @xmath60 and @xmath61 events for @xmath62 .",
    "to calculate a ratio for inclusive @xmath63 production , we have to estimate the absolute branching fraction scale for @xmath63 decays .",
    "we do this by assuming that the semileptonic widths for all charm hadrons is the same , and that @xmath64 saturates the @xmath63 semileptonic width ( similarly for @xmath65 ) .",
    "this leads to upper limits on the branching fraction of @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "i should point out that these assumptions are not very reliable , and only serve to make a `` crude '' estimate .",
    "using cleo data for the semileptonic data , we get that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 . using these estimates , we find that @xmath71)~\\approx~1.5\\pm~0.7 $ ] , which is not terribly conclusive .",
    "this result is consistent with a small rate for @xmath43 transitions in baryon production , which is in sharp disagreement with the result from @xmath72 correlations .",
    "most likely , the branching fraction scale for the charmed baryons is wrong .",
    "@xmath0 transitions do take place , as evidenced by @xmath73 , charmonium states .",
    "our preliminary results indicate that the rate for @xmath0 is not enough to solve the @xmath41 `` problem '' .",
    "we find this branching fraction to be @xmath74 instead of the expected 12% , and we also find @xmath39 , the number of charm quarks / b quark to be @xmath75 instead of 1.3 .",

    "@xmath77 @xmath78 the ratio of the vector to pseduoscalar final states in @xmath20 semileptonic decays is about the same as one finds in non - strange d semileptonic decays ( @xmath79 ) . in the past , most theoretical models predicted this ratio to be 1 .",
    "* we have made the first measurement of exclusive @xmath80 decays , @xmath81 @xmath82 these branching fractions have been obtained using isospin constraints between the final states @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
