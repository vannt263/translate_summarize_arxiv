    "exclusive radiative decays of the heavy vector states @xmath19 and @xmath0 have been the subject of many experimental and theoretical studies . for the experimenter , the final states from @xmath42 are easy to identify and measure in that they have a high energy photon and low multiplicity of other particles .",
    "backgrounds also tend to be small .",
    "theoretically the emission of the photon leaves behind a glue - rich environment from which to learn about the formation of resonances from two gluons or to discover new forms of hadronic matter .",
    "because gluons ( @xmath43 ) themselves carry the quantum number of `` color '' , qcd allows for states with _ no _ valence quarks ( @xmath44 ) , but only gluon constituents : `` glueballs '' .",
    "qcd also allows for more exotic combinations such as @xmath45 `` hybrids '' .",
    "these glueballs and hybrids are not just more resonances in the spectrum - they represent fundamentally different forms of matter from the mesons and baryons with which we are so familiar .    for the @xmath19 charmonium system ( the @xmath46 state of @xmath47 )",
    "many such radiative two - body decays have been observed@xcite , with some of the dominant ones being @xmath48(1270 ) , @xmath5 , and @xmath49 . however , the only such observation in the radiative decay of the @xmath0 ( the @xmath46 state of @xmath50 ) is by cleo@xcite in the final state @xmath51 , in which an enhancement in the di - pion invariant mass consistent with being the @xmath52(1270 ) meson was observed .",
    "a recent cleo search@xcite for the radiative production of the @xmath53 meson yielded only an upper limit .    in this article",
    "we present a search for the radiative production of the other isoscalar pseudoscalar , namely the @xmath6 meson . as with the final state @xmath49 ,",
    "this channel has received significant theoretical attention . the work of krner , khn , krammer , and schneider  @xcite and the followup publication by khn @xcite use highly virtual gluons to predict minimal suppression of radiative pseudoscalar production as the vector meson mass goes from that of the @xmath19 to that of the @xmath0 .",
    "intemann  @xcite used the vector dominance model ( vdm ) to predict branching fractions for @xmath1 taking into account the interference between the @xmath0 and @xmath54 , the major contributing vector mesons in the model .",
    "baier and grozin @xcite showed that for lighter vector mesons ( such as the @xmath19 ) there might be an additional `` anomaly '' diagram that contributes significantly to the radiative decays .",
    "ball , frre , and tytgat worked along similar lines  @xcite .",
    "however , baier and grozin note that their approach applies directly to the `` singlet '' member of the meson nonet .",
    "feldmann , kroll , and stech@xcite pursue the ideas of mixing in the decay constants of the pseudoscalars to derive ratios of their radiative production .",
    "chao@xcite has taken this approach further , determining mixing angles such as @xmath55 between the @xmath56 and @xmath6 in order to calculate radiative branching fractions .",
    "finally , the recent work of ma jian - ping  @xcite uses factorization at tree level with non - relativistic qcd matrix elements to describe the heavy vector meson portion multiplied by a set of twist-2 and twist-3 gluonic distribution amplitudes .",
    "the other search we present here is for the radiative production of the @xmath16(2220 ) , also known as the @xmath57(2230 ) , in @xmath0 decay .",
    "many theoretical calculations of the spectrum of glueballs predict a @xmath58 state in the area of 2.2 gev/@xmath59 .",
    "a candidate for this tensor glueball has been seen by some experiments , but not by others@xcite .",
    "the most complete claim of observation is by the bes collaboration who have published results@xcite for @xmath60(2220 ) with the @xmath16(2220 ) reconstructed in @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 as well as for @xmath65@xcite and for @xmath66@xcite . of significant interest",
    "are several non - observations .",
    "cleo has not seen the @xmath16 in two - photon interactions@xcite , which would lend credence to its being a glueball .",
    "however , a narrow resonance in this mass region was not seen in @xmath63 production by either jetset @xcite or , more recently , by crystal barrel@xcite .",
    "this non - observation sheds doubt on the very existence of the @xmath16 .",
    "our analyses used 61.3 pb@xmath3 of @xmath4 data recorded at the @xmath0(1s ) resonance ( @xmath67 gev ) with the cleo ii detector@xcite operating at the cornell electron storage ring ( cesr ) .",
    "this corresponds to the production of @xmath68 @xmath0(1s ) mesons@xcite .",
    "in addition , significantly larger samples taken near in time to this @xmath0(1s ) data but at energies at or just below the @xmath0(4s ) were used for comparison to the underlying continuum .",
    "the momenta and ionization loss ( @xmath69 ) of charged tracks were measured in a six - layer straw - tube chamber , a ten - layer precision drift chamber , and a 51-layer main drift chamber , all operating in a 1.5  t solenoidal magnetic field .",
    "photon detection and electron suppression were accomplished using the high - resolution electromagnetic calorimeter consisting of 7800 thallium - doped csi crystals .",
    "the work presented here used only events with the primary , high - energy photon in the barrel portion of this detector , defined as @xmath70 , because the energy resolution for photons and reconstruction efficiency of the recoiling neutral mesons are degraded in the end cap regions and because the efficient , well understood triggers involve only the barrel region of the calorimeter . between the central drift chamber and the electromagnetic calorimeter , strips of scintillating plastic",
    "were used for triggering and for measuring time - of - flight .",
    "proportional tracking chambers for muon identification were located between and outside the iron slabs that provide the magnetic flux return .",
    "the monte carlo simulation of the detector response was based upon geant@xcite , and simulation events were processed in an identical fashion to data .",
    "our search for @xmath71 involved the decays @xmath72 , @xmath73 , or @xmath74 ; the latter two will collectively be referred to as @xmath10 .",
    "we followed procedures very similar to those used in our recent publication on the @xmath49 final state@xcite . in order to maximize detection efficiency and minimize possible systematic biases , we employed a minimal number of selection criteria , with combinatoric background largely suppressed by requiring reconstruction of both the @xmath0 and @xmath6 mesons .",
    "events were required to have the proper number of quality tracks ( either zero or two ) of appropriate charges and at least three calorimeter energy clusters ( which may or may not be associated with the tracks ) , of which one had to correspond to an energy of at least 4 gev and be in the barrel fiducial volume ( @xmath75 @xmath76 0.71 ) .",
    "in addition , we required that the events pass trigger criteria @xcite , based purely on the calorimeter , that were highly efficient and could be reliably simulated .    for reconstructing @xmath77 candidates ,",
    "the photon candidates had to have minimum depositions of 30 ( 50 ) mev in the barrel ( endcap ) regions@xmath12@xmath78@xmath12@xmath79 ; the region between this and the barrel fiducial region is not used due to its poor resolution . ] and could not be associated with any charged track ; in addition , at least one of the two photons had to be in the barrel region .",
    "the @xmath9 invariant mass had to be within 50 mev/@xmath59 ( @xmath80 ) of the known @xmath77 mass@xcite ; such candidates were then kinematically constrained to that mass .",
    "the photon candidates used in reconstructing the @xmath6 meson in @xmath9 had to deposit a minimum of 60 ( 100 )  mev in the barrel ( endcap ) calorimeter regions , could not be identified as a fragment of a charged track deposition , and had to have a lateral profile consistent with that of a photon .    for the @xmath81 modes we then built @xmath6 candidates from @xmath8 or @xmath7 .",
    "simulation events were used to determine the detector mass resolution for these two signal modes : @xmath82 and 9.0 mev/@xmath59 , respectively .",
    "candidates had to be within @xmath83 of the known @xmath6 mass .",
    "in the case of the @xmath84 final state , no photon could be common to more than one @xmath77 combination . to suppress qed backgrounds in the @xmath85 final state",
    ", a charged track was rejected if its momentum , @xmath86 , from the drift chamber matched its energy , @xmath87 , as measured in the calorimeter as 0.85 @xmath12@xmath88@xmath12  1.05 .",
    "then , @xmath0 candidates were formed by combining the high - energy photon ( @xmath87@xmath894 gev ) with the @xmath6 candidate , requiring that this photon not already be used in reconstructing the event . to be considered ,",
    "such a candidate had to have an invariant mass within @xmath90 mev/@xmath59 of @xmath91 , a window of roughly three times the detector resolution as obtained from our simulations .",
    "although , in general , multiple candidates per event were not restricted , there were two exceptions : ( i ) in the case of @xmath73 , if two @xmath6 candidates shared more than four photons , the candidate with the better combined @xmath92 for mass fits to the three @xmath77 candidates was accepted ; and ( ii ) in the case of @xmath74 , if two candidates for the neutral pion shared a daughter photon , the one with the better fit to the @xmath77 mass was taken .",
    "after these highly - efficient procedures were applied , we found _ no _ candidates in either the 61.3 pb@xmath3 of @xmath0(1s ) data or in 189 pb@xmath3 of continuum data samples.(4s ) resonance , we note that @xmath93 meson decays can not have a high energy photon so that the analysis of these data yields only @xmath94 or qed backgrounds . ]    from monte carlo simulations , the overall efficiencies for each channel , @xmath95 , were determined to be @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the decay chains ending in @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "the uncertainties here include the statistics of the monte carlo samples and our estimates on possible systematic biases , which we discuss below . including the branching fractions for the @xmath6 decays@xcite and their uncertainties gave @xmath98 = ( 8.7 \\pm 0.5)\\%$ ] for @xmath99 .    for the final state @xmath100 ,",
    "the significant qed background compelled us to change the order of the constraints on the meson reconstruction and to add one additional selection criterion . here",
    "we _ first _ took three photons , as defined above , and required that @xmath101 300 mev/@xmath59 .",
    "then we took the photons in pairs and plotted the spectrum of @xmath102 .    a large background exists in both the @xmath0(1s ) and @xmath0(4s ) data sets , peaking near 0.40 gev/@xmath59 . from scanning such events",
    "it is evident that these are @xmath103 events with pair production by one of the photons giving a final state of @xmath104 .",
    "tracks were not reconstructed in this subset of events due to the timing characteristics of the energy - based triggers in cleo  ii .",
    "such conversion events have their showers separated only in azimuth , in that the lepton pair has zero opening angle and any observed separation is due only to the bending by the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , to suppress this @xmath104 background , we removed events for which the angular separation in the calorimeter had no polar angle ( @xmath105 ) component .    to show that most of the remaining @xmath100 background is of qed or continuum origin and not from the @xmath0(1s ) , we took the higher - energy data and performed the same analysis .",
    "we then subtracted this spectrum of @xmath102 from the @xmath0(1s ) spectrum , after scaling it by the relative integrated luminosity , the relative reconstruction efficiencies , and the relative production rates .",
    "the last of these is determined from @xmath94 continuum simulations at the two energies , for which we counted the number of events having one two - photon combination with an invariant mass within @xmath106 of @xmath107 .",
    "the mass resolution of @xmath108 = 15.7 mev/@xmath59 is taken from simulation of signal events .",
    "the result of this subtraction is shown in figure [ subtraction_fit ] ; the integral of the entries in this figure is @xmath109 , consistent with zero .",
    "we then performed a binned likelihood fit of the @xmath0(1s ) data , using the value of the corresponding bin in the scaled distribution from the @xmath0(4s ) data and a gaussian signal function . here",
    "the gaussian had a mean of the established @xcite value of the mass of the @xmath6 meson and a width taken from our simulations of the signal ( @xmath110 mev/@xmath59 ) .",
    "the result of the fit is shown in figure  [ subtraction_fit ] , yielding @xmath111 events .",
    "bin - by - bin statistical variations in the @xmath0(4s ) spectrum were taken into account by performing this procedure multiple times , each time randomly assigning the number of events in each @xmath0(4s ) bin , according to the statistics of that bin .",
    "the distribution function used in determining the limit was the average of these several functions .    for this mode",
    "our overall reconstruction efficiency from signal simulation , including possible systematic biases and statistical uncertainties from the simulation , is @xmath112    the major sources of possible systematic uncertainty in our efficiency calculation for @xmath1 are shown in table [ systerr ] .",
    "these follow closely those detailed in our prior study of @xmath113@xcite .",
    "the degree of uniformity and definition of the fiducial volume of the barrel calorimeter ( @xmath1142.2% ) relates to our modeling the detector response to the proper angular distribution for this radiative @xmath0 decay .",
    "uncertainties in charged - track reconstruction ( @xmath1141.0% per track ) , and trigger effects ( @xmath1142.0% ) were determined from previous detailed cleo studies of low - multiplicity @xmath115-pair and @xmath9 events .",
    "similar studies allowed determination of the possible uncertainty in the reconstruction of @xmath77 and @xmath6 mesons from photons@xcite ( @xmath1143% per meson ) ; this relates to our ability to find and measure the daughter photons and , in the case of the neutral pions , to have the two - photon invariant mass be within the @xmath116 window around the established @xmath77 mass .",
    "our ability to model the @xmath88 requirement in the @xmath85 final state was assessed using charged pions from @xmath117 decays and assigned an uncertainty of @xmath118 .",
    "shower leakage and other calorimeter effects make the mass distribution for @xmath0 candidates asymmetric ; based on cleo experience with exclusive radiative @xmath93 meson decays@xcite we have assigned an uncertainty of @xmath119 regarding our ability to model these effects .",
    "based on a study of varying the mass resolution , @xmath108 , in fits to the data before all the final criteria were imposed , we assign a systematic uncertainty of @xmath1145% from this source .",
    "these uncertainties were added in quadrature , along with the statistical uncertainty associated with the size of monte carlo samples , to obtain the overall systematic uncertainty in the efficiencies .",
    ".systematic uncertainty contributions , as relative percentages , to the efficiency for the studied decay modes for @xmath1 .",
    "the combined uncertainties were obtained using quadrature addition . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ resultstab ]    as a comparison we have also computed the upper limits following the traditional approach of summing up the poisson distribution @xmath120 to 90% c.l . for @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ", this gives limits of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively .",
    "ignoring backgrounds the corresponding upper limits on the product branching fractions , including systematic effects , are @xmath125 for @xmath61 , @xmath126 for @xmath127 , and @xmath128 for @xmath63 .",
    "note that this method can lead to under - coverage , as outlined in the paper by feldman and cousins  @xcite .",
    "the only other reported analysis  @xcite of @xmath11 is by crystal ball  @xcite , which determined a 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit of @xmath129 ; our limit of @xmath130 is @xmath131 times more stringent .",
    "we can then use our new limit on @xmath11 , the measured enhancement@xcite near 1270 mev/@xmath59 in @xmath132 , and the measurements of @xmath133(@xmath134(1270))@xmath135 and @xmath133(@xmath136  @xcite to create interesting ratios . here",
    "we assume that the observed structure in the di - pion mass spectrum near 1270 mev/@xmath59 in the @xmath0 study is totally due to @xmath52 production , which implies @xmath133(@xmath137(1270))@xmath138 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath139    @xmath140    and , looking instead at the ratios of the two final states for a given vector parent ,    @xmath141    @xmath142    these results were obtained by including the various uncertainties in a monte carlo technique . in the last two of the ratios , we assume that all the uncertainties from the @xmath19 and @xmath0 measurements are uncorrelated .",
    "our limits show that the branching fractions into @xmath5 and @xmath48(1270 ) behave differently in the cases of @xmath19 and @xmath0 , although not as dramatically as in the case of @xmath113@xcite .",

    "this range of predictions is well below our new limit .",
    "ma uses a technique in which the decay amplitude factorizes into a non - relativistic piece describing the bound state of the heavy quarkonium and an expansion in `` twist '' to characterize the conversion of the gluons into the final state meson .",

    "[ resultstab ] we show the results from bes@xcite for these channels in radiative @xmath19 decay , scaled by a factor of @xmath156 .",
    "this scaling arises from the naive expectation that the amplitude for the radiative process of meson formation varies directly as the quark charge ( to couple to the photon ) and inversely as the quark mass ( from the fermionic propagator between the photon emission and the resonance formation ) .",
    "one then squares this to get the rate and corrects for the full widths of the heavy quarkonia@xcite to obtain    @xmath157    here we have used masses of 1.7 gev/@xmath59 and 5.2 gev/@xmath59 for the charm and bottom quarks , respectively . as shown in table [ resultstab ] and in figure [ summaryfigure ] , our limits on radiative @xmath16(2220 ) production",
