    "a particularly simple and efficient control scheme is time - delayed feedback which occurs naturally in a number of biological systems including neural networks where both propagation delays of electrical signals connecting different neurons and local neurovascular couplings lead to time delays @xcite .",

    "chaos control techniques have been first applied experimentally _ in vitro _ in a spontaneously bursting neural network @xcite using a method proposed by ott , grebogi and yorke @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this method , the time - delayed feedback method by pyragas @xcite and its extensions @xcite do not require detailed information on the system to be controlled , and they are non - invasive , i.e. , once the target state is reached , the control force vanishes . however , one needs to tune the feedback gain and the delay time .",

    "such electrical synapses are less common than chemical synapses , but it has been shown in hippocampal slices that high - frequency synchronized oscillations are independent of chemical synaptic transmission @xcite , and physiological , pharmacological , and structural evidence was provided @xcite that axons of hippocampal pyramidal cells are electrically coupled ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ( a ) ) .",
    "time delays in the coupling must be considered particularly in the case of high - frequency oscillations .    the simplest model that displays features of neural interaction consists of two coupled neural systems .",
    "a single electrical synapse can lead to synchronized co - operative behaviour between two axo - axonally coupled hippocampal pyramidal cells when only one of them is stimulated antidromically at high frequency @xcite .",
    "moreover , such neurons have been shown to reflect antidromic spikes ( propagating opposite to the normal direction ) at the soma , but a continuous reverberating activity is not generated by axonal reflections in two axo - axonally coupled cells alone @xcite . in order to describe the complicated interaction between billions of neurons in large neural networks ,",
    "the neurons are often lumped into highly connected sub - networks or synchronized sub - ensembles .",
    "such neural populations are usually localized spatially and contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons @xcite . in this sense ,",
    "the model of two mutually coupled neurons may also serve as a paradigm of two coupled neural sub - ensembles .",
    "starting from such simplest network motifs , larger networks can be built , and their effects may be studied . for example , starting from two interconnected reticular thalamic neurons with oscillatory behavior , it was shown in @xcite how more complex dynamics emerges in ring networks with nearest neighbors and fully reciprocal connectivity , or in networks organized in a two - dimensional array with proximal connectivity and `` dense proximal '' coupling in which every neuron connects to all other neurons within some radius . in another example @xcite , a neural population was itself modeled as a small sub - network of excitable elements , to study hierarchically clustered organization of excitable elements in a _ network of networks_.    in the following , we consider two mutually coupled neurons modelled by the paradigmatic fitzhugh - nagumo system @xcite in the excitable regime : @xmath5\\nonumber\\\\          \\dot{y}_1 & = & x_1 + a + d_1 \\xi_1(t ) \\nonumber\\\\          \\epsilon_2 \\dot{x}_2 & = & x_2 - \\frac{x_2 ^ 3}{3 } - y_2 + c[x_1(t-\\tau)-x_2(t)]\\nonumber\\\\          \\dot{y}_2 & = & x_2 + a + d_2 \\xi_2(t )      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to single neurons ( or neuron populations ) , which are linearly coupled with coupling strength @xmath0 . the variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 are related to the transmembrane voltage and @xmath10 , @xmath11 refer to various quantities connected to the electrical conductance of the relevant ion currents .",
    "here @xmath12 is an excitability parameter whose value defines whether the system is excitable ( @xmath13 ) or exhibits self - sustained periodic firing ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the timescale parameters that are usually chosen to be much smaller than unity , corresponding to fast activator variables @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and slow inhibitor variables @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the synaptic coupling between two neurons is modelled as a diffusive coupling considered for simplicity to be symmetric @xcite .",
    "more general delayed couplings are considered in @xcite .",

    "the mutual delay @xmath17 in the coupling is motivated by the propagation delay of action potentials between the two neurons @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "each neuron is driven by gaussian white noise @xmath18 @xmath19 with zero mean and unity variance .",
    "the noise intensities are denoted by parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .    besides the delayed coupling we will also consider delayed self - feedback in the form suggested by pyragas @xcite , where the difference @xmath20 of a system variable @xmath21 ( e.g. , activator or inhibitor ) at time @xmath22 and at a delayed time @xmath23 , multiplied by some control amplitude @xmath2 , is coupled back into the same system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme](b ) ) . such feedback loops might arise naturally in neural systems , e.g. , due to neurovascular couplings that has a characteristic latency , or due to finite propagation speed along cyclic connections within a neuron sub - population , or they could be realized by external feedback loops as part of a therapeutical measure , as proposed in ref .",
    "this feedback scheme is simple to implement , quite robust , and has already been applied successfully in a real experiment with time - delayed neurofeedback from real - time magnetoencephalography ( meg ) signals to humans via visual stimulation in order to suppress the alpha rhythm , which is observed due to strongly synchronized neural populations in the visual cortex in the brain @xcite .",
