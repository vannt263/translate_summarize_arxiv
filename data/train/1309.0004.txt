    "as the riddle indicates , to first order galactic disk light falls off exponentially with radius .",
    "this trend was observed early on @xcite . within a few decades",
    ", it was discovered that not all spirals are a simple exponential plus a central bulge @xcite ; some edge - on spirals appeared to be sharply truncated at large radius ( van der kruit 1979 ; van der kruit & shostak 1982 ; shostak & van der kruit 1984 ; van der kruit 1987 ; de grijs et al.2001 ; kregel et al.2002 ; pohlen et al.2002 ; kregel & van der kruit 2004 ) . more recently , large deep studies ( erwin et al.2005 ; pohlen & trujillo 2006 ( pt06 ) ; erwin et al.2008 ( epb08 ) ; gutirrez et al.2011 ( geab11 ) ) have shown breaks are common in the surface brightness exponential fall - off in spirals .",
    "type  i profiles follow a single exponential to the full probed depth ; these are surprisingly rare .",
    "the majority of late - type spirals now appear to be `` truncated '' ( type  ii ) where the disk light continues to fall off , but more steeply beyond the break ( pt06 ) .",
    "lastly , many spirals have `` anti - truncated '' ( type  iii ) profiles where the fall off is _ shallower _ beyond the break ( erwin et  al.2005 ) .",
    "figure  5 of pt06 shows examples of type  i , ii , and iii spirals .",
    "why there are three different radial profile types ( i , ii , and iii ) is still a mystery , including why light falls off as an exponential at all .",
    "ideas proposed to explain why there are three different profile types include angular momentum limits in a collapsing protogalactic cloud @xcite or star formation ( sf ) thresholds caused by radial variations in gas density or phase @xcite . one recent development deals with radial color trends .",
    "bakos et  al.(2008 ) found that type  ii spirals have redder colors beyond the break ; their interpretation is that interactions with spiral arms cause older , redder stars to migrate outwards .",
    "additionally , the color changes appear to be due to differing stellar populations such that the mass - to - light ratio varies , so type  ii breaks exist in the light distribution but are much less conspicuous in the mass profile .",
    "some simulations further support this interpretation @xcite , although simulations by @xcite indicate that a disk - metallicity gradient and an inside - out formation scenario may also be important .",
    "additionally , younger et  al.(2007 ) have suggested that type  iii profiles may generally be caused by minor mergers .",
    "spirals are not the only galaxies with different stellar profile types : disk - like dwarf galaxies also have these properties . presented broadband ( @xmath10 and some @xmath11 ) disk surface photometry for 136 dwarfs and found that @xmath730% have a surface brightness break .",
    "additionally , dwarfs have a fourth classification : flat or even increasing intensity with increasing radius in the central regions ( fi ) before falling off beyond some break .",
    "figure  [ rep7 ] shows example dwarf galaxy profiles of the different types .",
    "zhang et  al.(2012 ) performed a spectral energy distribution analysis of a subset of 34 of the above 136 dwarfs .",
    "they found that 27 dwarfs ( @xmath780% ) have type  ii profiles corresponding to a steeper radial decline of the sf rate ( sfr ) in the outer areas with respect to the inner disk .",
    "they also found that outer disk scale lengths are shorter in bluer bands ( probing young stellar populations ) than in redder bands ( probing older stellar populations ) , at least for type  ii dwarfs .",
    "they interpreted these results as an outside - in shrinking of the star - forming disks .",
    "this is in contrast to spirals where evidence suggests an inside - out disk evolution ( e.g.larson 1976 ; chiappini et al.1997 ; mo et al.1998 ; naab & ostriker 2006 ) .",
    "breaks are not only seen in the local universe , but also at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath12 ; prez 2004 ; trujillo et  al.2009 ) .",
    "studied 238 type  ii galaxies separated into three redshift bins : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 and also compared their results to the @xmath16 sample of pt06 .",
    "they found trends between the break radius , @xmath17 , the surface brightness at the break , @xmath18 , the inner scale length , @xmath19 , and the ratio of @xmath20 with @xmath5 as well as trends with redshift such that type  ii galaxies at higher redshift have shorter @xmath17 , brighter @xmath18 , roughly unchanging @xmath19 , and smaller @xmath20 than local analogs .",
    "dwarfs are the most common type of galaxy in the universe and the closest analogs to the building blocks of larger systems , so they are important to understand for piecing together the process of galaxy formation .",
    "disk - like dwarfs do not have spiral arms but still have type  ii profiles , so a radial color trend analysis similar to that of bakos et  al.(2008 ) is needed for dwarfs . the first step in the statistical analysis",
    "is to fit type  i , ii , and iii profiles as reliably as possible to a large sample of dwarf surface brightness profiles .",
    "upon further examination of the original 136 profiles from @xcite supplemented with five additional dwarfs as well as ancillary data at additional passbands , we noticed that more profiles than identified by hunter & elmegreen may be fit as well ( if not better ) by broken exponentials instead of a single exponential .",
    "often breaks became more evident when additional passbands were examined .",
    "furthermore , different bands highlight different stellar populations ( such as uv and h@xmath2 for recent sf ) , so any changes with wavelength could be evidence of galaxy evolution .",
    "therefore , we undertook a re - examination of the profile types of the entire 141 dwarf sample in up to 11 passbands .    here",
    "we present the statistical results of a human - assisted computerized fitting of the multi - wavelength data set of surface brightness profiles . in section 2",
    "we review the sample and the data sources .",
    "we explain the fitting process , including many complications , in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains copious results before we end with a summary and brief discussion .",
    "future papers in this series will focus on topics such as radial color trends and mass profiles , break relationships to gas surface density and kinematics ( in the smaller little things41 galaxy subsample ) , and an exploration of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) images for each profile type .",
    "our galaxy sample ( see table  [ sample ] ) is from the survey of hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 ) , which includes 94 dwarf irregulars ( dims ) , 26 blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , and 20 magellanic - type spirals ( sms ) .",
    "( the sm f567 - 2 is missing from this study and two dims , f473-v1 and f620-v3 , have been added . )",
    "bcds are similar to dims , but with central concentrations of gas , stars , and sf .",
    "they are generally believed to be undergoing a burst of sf .",
    "sm galaxies mark the transition between late - type spirals and the irregular galaxy class .",
    "most of the galaxies were chosen to be relatively nearby ( @xmath2130 mpc ) , not obviously interacting , containing gas so they could be forming stars , and with a wide range in @xmath5 and sf rate surface density .",
    "hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 ) presented narrow - band h@xmath2 images of these galaxies obtained in 22 observing runs primarily at lowell observatory .",
    "( note that sometimes no h@xmath2 emission was detected . )",
    "optical broad - band images of galaxies are dominated by the past 1  gyr of sf whereas near infrared light integrates the sf over a galaxy s lifetime .",

    "the surface photometry from the legacy projects included 3.6  @xmath4 m data but not 4.5  @xmath4 m , resulting in significantly more 3.6 than 4.5 @xmath4 m profiles .",
    "we were careful to remove or mask out foreground stars and background objects , and in most cases we did a 2d fit to the sky around the galaxy before subtraction .",
    "note that significant care was taken to prevent over- or under - subtraction of the sky to ensure that breaks are not artifacts of data handling ( see section 3.3 of hunter & elmegreen 2006 as well as hunter et al.2011 for a discussion of sky subtraction and comparisons between images obtained with different telescopes ) .",
    "the surface photometry was azimuthally averaged by integrating in ellipses that increase in semi - major axis length in @xmath710  steps . though these galaxies are irregular in shape , this analysis appears to work well .",
    "( see section 3.4 about asymmetries . ) for each galaxy , the geometric parameters ( morphological center , position angle , and minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath26 ) were determined from the @xmath6-band outer isophotes and applied to all passbands the same way .",
    "see section 3 and table 2 of hunter & elmegreen ( 2004 , 2006 ) for more details on the surface photometry including the geometric parameters and ellipse widths .",
    "the surface brightness uncertainties were determined from poisson statistics using galaxy and sky counts and range from @xmath70.001 mag in the ( relatively ) bright , central regions to @xmath71 mag in the fainter outskirts .",
    "( see equation  1 and the surrounding text in hunter & elmegreen 2006 for more details . )",
    "while it is possible to fit profile breaks by eye , when there are 141 galaxies and data in up to 11 passbands , it is preferable to devise an automatic method .",
    "more importantly , in these small and faint dwarfs with as few as four points in their radial profiles , sometimes it is difficult to decide qualitatively ( 1 ) if there should be a break and ( 2 ) where the break should occur .",
    "consequently , a program was written to determine the `` best '' fit , single or double exponentials , for each of the total 776 profiles .",
    "because exponentials in surface brightness appear as lines when the data is treated logarithmically ( i.e. , in magnitudes ) , `` broken '' or `` double '' exponentials are synonymous with two - line fits .",
    "single and double exponentials are not the only functions that could be used to fit surface brightness profiles : sersic functions @xcite could also be used . however , for a direct comparison with spirals ( such as the study of bakos et  al.2008 ) , the single and double exponential fits are required .",
    "also , sersic fits could naturally fit type  i and ii ( down - bending ) profiles , but some additional changes would need to be applied to the equations to fit type  iii ( up - bending ) profiles .",
    "lastly , cases where the inner and outer sections are precisely two exponentials , without any curvature , will not be well fit by sersic functions .",
    "a re - fitting of the complete sample with adjusted sersic equations may be a project for a future paper in this series .",
    "for all the linear fitting , we started with a minimizing @xmath27 function from @xcite , which returns the slope , @xmath28-intercept , and corresponding probable uncertainties .",
    "if @xmath28 standard deviations are used to weight the data , the function also returns @xmath27 and the goodness - of - fit probability @xmath29 ( that the fit would have @xmath27 this large or larger ) calculated from the incomplete gamma function .",
    "if no weighting is applied , @xmath29 is returned as 1.0 and the returned value of @xmath27 is normalized to unit standard deviation on all points . for each of the 141 dwarf galaxies , each passband profile",
    "is examined by the program separately .",
    "consequently , the program determines the best fit for each passband independently .",
    "the first step is to determine the best type  i linear fit of all the radial data for the galaxy and passband under consideration .",
    "weighting by 1/@xmath30 is used because the original 1/@xmath31 weighting gave visibly poor fits to the data because the uncertainties are not distributed via a gaussian function , instead ranging from 0.001 to @xmath71 mag .",
    "consequently , 1/@xmath31 weighting would weight some data as much as @xmath32 times more than others , yielding a fit very biased by the ( inner ) data with very low uncertainty . to keep the different radii independent yet",
    "still account for higher uncertainties of some data , the 1/@xmath30 weighting was used as a compromise between complete uncertainty weighting and no weighting at all .",
    "next the program iteratively breaks the radial profile into every possible pair of subsets with at least two data points ( see section 3.2.4 about fitting only two data points ) and determines the best linear fit of each subset , again using 1/@xmath30 weighting .",
    "figure  [ method ] illustrates this procedure for the @xmath6 data of ddo  43 .",
    "when isolating every possible pair of subsets , the program tries ( 1 ) including each inner point in both subsets ( i.e. , sometimes the break occurs essentially at a `` knee '' point , where that point fits well on both sides , shown in the left side of figure  [ method ] ) as well as ( 2 ) testing each inner point on only one side ( i.e. , alternately the break occurs firmly in between two points , shown in the right side of figure  [ method ] ) .",
    "the `` best '' broken fit has ( 1 ) the minimum sum of the @xmath27 values from the inner and outer fits such that ( 2 ) a `` break '' ( i.e. , intersection of the inner and outer linear fits ) occurs between the correct data points .",
    "this second test was implemented to prevent fits with very low summed @xmath27 values where the `` break '' occurred at unphysically negative or very large radii .    in this manner ,",
    "1/@xmath30 weighting is used for the type  i fitting and determining the data set separations for the break locations but no weighting is used for the final broken fits .",
    "the uncertainties on values such as the scale length ( @xmath33slope ) , the break location ( @xmath17= the radius where the two fits intersect ) , the surface brightness at the break ( @xmath18 ) , and ratios such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 where the @xmath36 and @xmath37 subscripts denote inner and outer sections , respectively , are determined from propagating the uncertainties on the slope and @xmath28-intercept values .",
    "uncertainty propagation is always calculated under the assumption that the variables are not correlated ( i.e. , uncertainties in @xmath17 and @xmath38 are both calculated from the slopes , but that is ignored when determining the uncertainty in @xmath34 ) . when 1/@xmath30 weighting was used for each segment of a broken profile ,",
    "the propagated uncertainties on calculated values were typically larger than the values themselves . in the no weighting case ,",
    "the uncertainties on the slope and intercept values are multiplied by a factor of the reduced @xmath27 values to normalize @xmath27 to unit standard deviation on all points in an attempt to estimate the unknown standard deviations of the data points .",
    "since the reduced @xmath27 values are typically very small , corresponding to excellent fits , this process significantly decreases the final uncertainties .",
    "consequently , for the final fitting of the broken segments , no weighting is used , resulting in uncertainties smaller than their calculated values .",
    "note , however , that these uncertainties are only lower limits since systematic uncertainties ( such as zero point and distance uncertainties ) have not been included .",
    "ideally , the above fitting should determine the best fit of each profile .",
    "however , some intervention was necessary to deal with complications .",
    "first of all , how should the program choose whether a profile is better fit by a single exponential ( type  i ) or a broken profile ( type  ii , iii , or fi ) ? some parameters which logically should contain useful information are the individual values of @xmath27 , goodness - of - fit probability @xmath29 , as well as slope similarity on both sides of the break .",
    "we checked the values of these parameters in cases that were either clearly type  i or had strong breaks by eye to gauge how well they would do in distinguishing cases .",
    "unfortunately , there was no one obvious method to discriminate between the two cases . for the comparison between dwarfs and spirals to be meaningful ,",
    "the dwarf profiles needed to be classified as single or broken as reliably as possible , so some care was taken to determine how to distinguish between these two classifications .",
    "many of the profiles that appeared to be well fit as type  i by eye had @xmath39 , indicating an excellent fit , where the @xmath40 subscript indicates the single fit to the complete profile .",
    "others had @xmath41 where the @xmath36 and @xmath37 subscripts represent the inner and outer fits of the best broken fit .",
    "the factor of 0.8 was determined empirically ; the visual inspection of the best - fit profiles preferred this value over other values .",
    "however , it is understandable that a multiplicative factor less than 1 may be necessary .",
    "if the data truly define a single line , the fit should get better with more data points to average out noise .",
    "consequently , the factor of 0.8 serves to decrease the average @xmath27 value from the two broken fits since each will have of order half the size of the whole sample and thus have fewer data points to constrain the fit .",
    "alternately , in general if the data truly define two lines , then the @xmath42 value will be large anyway .",
    "thus the program defines a profile to be broken unless @xmath39 or @xmath41 .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is a measure of the break strength such that very broken profiles should have tiny @xmath44 values .",
    "figure  [ pfig ] shows the distribution of @xmath44 by percentage of profile types for the @xmath6 band data set .",
    "since the distribution of type  i profiles is relatively separate from those of the broken ( ii , iii , and fi ) profiles , the classification between broken and single fits appears to be robust .",
    "a one - dimensional ( 1d ) two sample kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test ( implemented from @xcite ) yields a probability @xmath45 that the distribution of @xmath44 for the type  is is the same as for those of the broken profiles but 29% , 10% , and 5.3% chances that the iii and fi , iii and ii , and ii and fi @xmath44 values are drawn from the same distributions , respectively .    in retrospect , we realized that the slope difference between the two sides and the average slope uncertainty could be used to determine if a profile should be type  i or broken .",
    "a broken profile should have a slope difference larger than the average uncertainties whereas the reverse should be true for type  i profiles .",
    "of the 16 instances of type  i profiles in @xmath6 , only one ( haro  8) would be broken by this test and all 125 profiles that were originally classified as being broken are still broken by this test .",
    "unfortunately , the above prescription for identifying single from broken profiles is not perfect , so human intervention was needed even after implementing the `` automatic '' way to determine between single and broken profiles described above .",
    "the profiles of some galaxies were _ forced _ to be single , broken , or even single in at least one passband but broken in others because the program was not sophisticated enough to make the best determination in all cases . of the 141 galaxies ,",
    "the program was allowed to choose between single or broken for 99 ( 70% ) of the sample . of the remaining 42 galaxies , 23 ( 16% of the total )",
    "were forced to be broken , 4 ( 3% of the total ) were forced to be single , and 15 ( 11% of the total ) were forced to be broken in some bands but single in others . while those percentages at first appear disturbing because they could have an effect on the percentage types discussed in section 4.3 , in every case that a profile was forced to be single or broken , information from multiple bands was used to make the decision .    out of the 23 forced breaks ,",
    "18 had clear breaks chosen by the program in most bands , but in at least one band , the break was hidden by large uncertainties , but still apparent to the eye .",
    "the remaining five did not have particularly large uncertainties but did have program - assigned breaks in most bands and nearby visible breaks in the remaining bands , so all were just forced to be broken , though the program still chose where the break should occur in each passband separately .",
    "these profiles were forced to be broken essentially to increase the samples of breaks in poorly represented passbands .",
    "the four that were forced to be unbroken appeared single in all four to seven bands , but the program was fooled by a little noise in a few bands . of the remaining 15 that were forced to be broken in some bands but single in others , six had at least one band that should be single ( by the program s standards , either because it should be type  i or because the data in that band did not go deeply enough to probe the break area of other bands ) but profiles in at least three passbands that should be broken ( by the program s standards ) and at least one additional band where the break was again hidden by large uncertainties , yet still visible . in those six cases",
    "the breaks that were hidden from the program by large uncertainties were forced to be broken .",
    "two more had clear breaks in all the passbands except one band that was not deep enough and thus was just forced to be single .",
    "the last seven had some clear breaks but at least some data , mostly in h@xmath2 , that really should have been type  i.      some hand - trimming of outlying points was needed in 53 galaxies ( 38% ) primarily due to deviations from sf clumps , especially in h@xmath2 and the bluer bands .",
    "a large subsample of the images with eliminated data was inspected visually to confirm that sf clumps are generally responsible for the eliminated outlying data .",
    "( figure  [ ddo50 ] shows an example galaxy with many eliminated points . )    in 20/53 ( 16% of the 129 with detectable h@xmath2 ) , only h@xmath2 outliers were eliminated because of at least one of the following : ( 1 ) the same trend was visible in the h@xmath2 data as in additional bands on both sides of the questionable point , ( 2 ) there was no clear large scale trend in the h@xmath2 data , but some small scale trends were consistent with those in other passbands whereas eliminated h@xmath2 points were not , ( 3 ) eliminated h@xmath2 points were discrepant from the remaining points by roughly the equivalent of 1 mag , and/or ( 4 ) the questionable points had large uncertainties with respect to the others .",
    "note that the h@xmath2 data are prone to being erratic because single regions can drastically affect individual radial bins .    of the remaining 33 galaxies , 16 had data eliminated in h@xmath2 as well as in some other band , 11 had either no h@xmath2 data at all or none by the outer radius of the questionable data , and the remaining six had h@xmath2 consistent with the general trend at the location of the questionable point in at least one other band .",
    "as with the h@xmath2 outliers , there were 17 cases where at least one outlier in some band was eliminated because the same clear trend was visible on both sides of the questionable point in that band and frequently in others as well .",
    "there were nine instances ( one included in the previous case of 17 ) where a point or two at either the inside or the outside was eliminated from the fits to prevent an additional break caused by just one slightly high or low point .",
    "five ( of the 33 ) galaxies ( ddo  46 , ddo  50 , ic  10 , ic  1613 , and ngc  6822 ) had outer data in at least two bands eliminated because they appeared to be an additional excess beyond the fitted broken profiles , but not a third exponential component .",
    "ddo  50 alone had 62 data points from 7 passbands ( fuv , nuv , @xmath10 , h@xmath2 , and 3.6  @xmath4 m ) eliminated due to 14 annuli with outliers , including 40 points in the excess region in the outermost 7 annuli .",
    "an examination of the 2d images for all five dwarfs indicates that the outer excess is caused by asymmetric sf clumps ( as in figure  [ ddo50 ] ) or perhaps even a limited field of view in a few cases .    in the three remaining ( of the 33 ) galaxies ( f620-v3 , haro  8 , and mrk  5 ) , each second point from the center",
    "was eliminated from all the observed bands because they appeared to be outliers from the general trend",
    ". however , the elimination of these points is particularly important in these three cases because without those outliers , the rest of the data are extremely well fit by a single exponential , i.e. , they are classified as type  i. because the first point in each of these cases was so identically on the line defined by the third through final points , a broken profile created an awkward overall fit to the data .",
    "consequently , eliminating the second point in each of these galaxies seems justified because all the remaining data define an excellent single exponential profile .",
    "figure  [ siganal ] shows the results of an analysis of the discrepancy between the eliminated data points and the final fits .",
    "table  [ tabelim ] lists numbers of eliminated and total data points . in the upper panel of figure  [ siganal ]",

    "as described in section 3.1 , the program splits each profile into every possible pair of continuous subsets containing _ at least two data points_. the decision to allow a minimum of _ two _ ( instead of three ) data points per section was motivated by many visible breaks in _ multiple _ bands after only two data points .",
    "( for example , see the profiles of ddo  155 and ddo  171 in the online version of figure  1 . ) these profiles would have been very difficult to fit without two data segments .",

    "@xmath47 weighting : _ when the minimizing @xmath27 function from @xcite is used to fit two points with @xmath47 weighting , it uses the weighting to return uncertainties on the slope and @xmath28-intercept but the goodness - of - fit probability @xmath29 can not be calculated because it depends on the number of points subtracted by two . also , the default @xmath27 is zero . to prevent a bias in defining breaks with two points on one side over using more data per side ,",
    "the @xmath27 values were changed for the two points case . in general , @xmath27 is increased by @xmath48 . for two points ,",
    "we assume that @xmath49 so @xmath50 .",

    "the 4.5  @xmath4 m statistics are severely limited by the small sample and the h@xmath2 statistics reflect the dominance of resolved sources in the azimuthal averaging .",
    "our final complication is that we found nine galaxies in our sample of 141 ( 6% ) whose profiles are better fit by three lines instead of two , and consequently contain two breaks .",
    "doubly broken profiles , though relatively uncommon , are not unheard of . in two large samples of spiral galaxies , a handful of so - called _",

    "interestingly , none of these studies found a spiral type  iii galaxy with an additional outer break .",
    "eight of the nine two break galaxies in our study first stood out when the program fit one break in some bands but a different break in others .",
    "visibly both breaks were apparent in more than one band .",
    "the ninth galaxy , ddo  125 , only has data in @xmath6 and the more erratic h@xmath2 .",
    "however , the one break fit to the ddo  125 @xmath6 band data was visibly poorer than most of the one break fits whereas the two break fit cleanly goes through every point .",
    "the basic program was not sophisticated enough to fit two breaks , so we forced it to fit three pieces by giving the data in two overlapping sections . in this manner , the program determined the location of the first break from the inner and middle data and then the second break from the middle and outer data .",
    "since it fit the middle section twice , the scale length and @xmath28-intercept uncertainties from the two versions of the fit were compared for each passband that contained two breaks , a total of 39 profiles .",
    "initially some differences were found due to the somewhat arbitrary decision of how to split the data for the two breaks .",
    "however , in almost every case , the fit with the lower uncertainty on the scale length also had the lower uncertainty on the @xmath28-intercept .",
    "this trend was applied to make the program use the better middle fit .",
    "the input was also iteratively adjusted to improve agreement between the two fits of the middle sections .",
    "once all the fitting was done , the next task was to subdivide the broken profiles into types  ii ( down - bending ) , iii ( up - bending ) , and fi ( flat inside or increasing ) .",
    "the most difficult subdivision was isolating the fi profiles from their parent ii type .",
    "empirically the fis were assigned to profiles having an inner slope less than 0.075 , corresponding to an inner scale length that is either greater than @xmath714.5 kpc or negative due to the surface brightness increasing from the center to the break .",
    "virtually all the profiles where the uncertainty on the inner scale length was larger than the value itself also appeared relatively flat inside , so this was an additional qualification for type  fi .",
    "the subdivision of the remaining broken profiles as either type  ii or iii was determined by a simple comparison between the inner and outer scale lengths ( or slopes ) such that iis are steeper beyond the break and thus have a shorter outer scale length ( larger slope ) and iiis are the reverse .",
    "( see table [ tabii_iii ] for some defining relationships about type  ii and iii profiles . )",

    "the h@xmath2 profile type was frequently disregarded when determining the overall profile type of each galaxy , listed in column 8 of table  1 . in some instances ,",
    "some bands had one profile type while at least one other had a different type .",
    "these galaxies , with _",
    "multiple _ profile types , are considered separately throughout the analysis .",
    "since fi is just a special case of type  ii profiles , galaxies with a combination of fi and ii are not considered to have multiple profile types . however , since there are enough fi / ii galaxies , they are considered a subcategory of type ii profiles .      one obvious method of checking the results of the fitting is to compare the breaks to those determined previously in hunter & elmegreen ( 2006 ) . although fewer profiles were fit with breaks in that study , there is still a large enough sample for comparison .",
    "figure  [ orignew ] shows the original @xmath6-band break locations plotted as a function of the values determined here . within the uncertainties",
    ", there is excellent agreement . the only clearly outlying data point ( a fi / ii break in the lower left ) belongs to mrk  178 .",
    "the profile of this bcd was originally fit with one break whereas it is one of the few two break profiles in this study .",
    "consequently , the discrepancy is not surprising .",
    "several other points are only just barely discrepant beyond their uncertainties .",
    "these are all irregular galaxies , so an important aspect to consider is if our first analysis step , azimuthal averaging , is even justified .",
    "to some extent , the intriguing trends ( or consistencies ) with @xmath5 , profile type , and wavelength in section 4 indicate that the fit parameters ( central and break brightnesses , scale lengths , and break locations ) are physically meaningful .",
    "( complete scatter plots could have indicated some potentially serious problems ! ) however , since the ends do not necessarily justify the means , we explored the nature of the breaks from simple cuts along the major axis of a few representative galaxies in figure  [ cuts ] . from these cuts",

    "note that pt06 and epb08 subclassify their type  ii profiles , but in a very different manner than what we have used here .",
    "there are no analogs to fi profiles in spirals .",
    "of the nine dwarf profiles that were best fit by two breaks in this study , four are iii+ii , three are some kind of ii+iii , and two are some kind of ii+ii where the inner and outer breaks are listed first then second , respectively .",
    "( one of both the ii+iii and ii+ii categories has a compound fi / ii as the inner break . ) as noted in section 3.2.5 and broken down in table  [ tab4studies ] , a few cases of iii+ii and ii+ii profiles have been identified in large samples of spiral galaxies ( pt06 , epb08 , geab11 ) . however , no iii+ii profiles have previously been presented and yet this mixed type is the most common in our sample of 141 dwarfs .",
    "also , the two early - type studies found no instances of ii+ii profiles whereas the two late - type studies found a total of four of these , indicating that hubble type might be related to a double downbending profile .",
    "of course , all the two break galaxy considerations are severely limited by small number statistics .",
    "the rarity of two break galaxies suggests that these mixed profiles perhaps only result from special circumstances .",
    "the similar percentages from the early - type to late - type studies suggest no trend with hubble type for two break galaxies , with the possible exception of double down - bending profiles .",
    "note that ddo  53 is the only galaxy in our sample with two breaks in the uv data but only one break in the other observed passbands .",
    "however , the uv data of ddo  53 do probe significantly farther out than the other bands .",
    "since epb08 and geab11 only explored @xmath99-band profiles , their studies do not contain information about breaks in different bands . using @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "pt06 presented one instance ( ic  1067 ) with a type  ii @xmath74 profile but a @xmath75 profile barely consistent with being type  i. however , macarthur et al.(2003 ) presented surface brightness profiles for 121 late - type spirals in the @xmath111 bandpasses and used a `` transition '' class for galaxies whose profiles change from type  ii in the optical to type  i in the infrared .",
    "consequently , a change of type with passband is not unprecedented . of the 13 dwarfs with multiple types for different passbands ,",

    "the peak of the fis lies between the two type  ii peaks ; the probability that log  sfr@xmath118 of the fis follows the same distribution as the iis is small ( 1.4% ) .",
    "since the dwarf survey was initially chosen to be relatively isolated , most of the galaxies have tidal indices indicative of being relatively isolated , so nothing useful can be said about any possible relationship between current isolation and profile types .",

    "profiles that are well fit by a single line ( or exponential ) are type  i whereas profiles requiring two lines ( double exponential ) with a steeper or shallower fall - off beyond the break are type  ii or iii , respectively .",
    "we also compare our dwarf results to three large studies of spirals : pt06 , epb08 , and geab11 .",
    "we have found the following :    cccc[b ] @xmath69 & 8,9 ( top ) & brighter & brighter + @xmath68 & 8,9 ( middle ) & brighter & brighter + @xmath18 & 8,9 ( bottom ) & brighter & brighter + @xmath97 & 11,12 ( top ) & @xmath119 ; steepens & @xmath120 ; shallows + @xmath38 & 11,12 ( middle ) & @xmath121 ; shallows & @xmath7constant + @xmath17 & 11,12 ( bottom ) & constant & constant + @xmath109 & 14 ( top ) & increases & decreases + @xmath110 & 14 ( middle ) & increases & decreases + @xmath34 & 14 ( bottom ) & decreases & constant    clear trends exist between @xmath5 and fit parameters ( see table  [ tabmb ] ) .",
    "brighter galaxies have brighter centers , larger inner and outer scale lengths , and break locations at larger radius .",
    "all of these trends extend smoothly from dwarfs to spirals .",
    "several parameters are independent of @xmath5 : ( 1 ) dwarfs have constant central colors ; ( 2 ) @xmath18 in @xmath6 appears to be roughly constant at 24 mag  arcsec@xmath83 with a standard deviation of 1 mag  arcsec@xmath83 for dwarfs and spirals , regardless of profile type ; ( 3 ) the ratios of @xmath109 and @xmath34 ( the latter only for type  iiis ) are essentially independent of @xmath5 , though differ with passband and profile type .",
    "( again , see table  [ tabmb ] . )    dwarf type  ii and iii profiles differ significantly with respect to their _ inner _ parameters ( @xmath69 and @xmath97 ) but their outer ( @xmath68 and @xmath38 ) parameters are similar , at least in the @xmath6-band . by contrast ,",
    "spiral types  ii and iii are different in both inner and outer parameters .",
    "dwarf type  iis break roughly twice as far out in linear scale as dwarf iiis but at roughly the same @xmath18 values whereas spiral type  ii and iii break locations are very similar .",
    "one difference in the outer regions of dwarf profiles is that @xmath38 values are equivalent in h@xmath2 and @xmath6 in type  iiis whereas type  ii @xmath38 values are significantly larger in h@xmath2 than in @xmath6 but slightly smaller in fuv than in @xmath6 .",
    "is this due to a difference in ( 1 ) the structure of the disks or ( 2 ) the sf histories ?",
    "we will explore this further in a future paper .",
    "for pure dwarf type  iis , the inner scale lengths _ decrease _ for redder bands ( at least from fuv to @xmath6 ) whereas they _ increase _ for redder bands for dwarf  iiis ( see table  [ tablambda ] ) .",
    "the outer scale lengths for dwarf  iiis are relatively constant ( or barely decrease ) from fuv to 3.6  @xmath4 m and generally overlap the single scale length in type  i profiles .",
    "however , @xmath38 may increase for redder bands for all dwarf type  ii profiles , as seen by @xcite .",
    "even so , the break location is relatively constant with respect to wavelength for both type  ii and iii dwarfs .",
    "dwarf galaxies are consistent with late - type galaxies in trends between profile types and galaxy hubble type such that later - type disk galaxies have more type  iis and fewer type  is and type  iiis than early - type disk galaxies .",
    "we present the first four reported galaxies with mixed surface brightness profiles of the type  iii+ii ( i.e. , an up - bending break followed farther out by a down - bending break ) .",
    "we also present 13 dwarfs with different profile types in different bands .",
    "perhaps most remarkable is that a study of breaks in surface brightness profiles has any meaning at all in dwarf galaxies .",
    "these systems are generally irregular in appearance and sf is distributed stochastically in lumps that can be large relative to the size of the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , we find that these relatively isolated dim , bcd , and sm galaxies have azimuthally - averaged surface brightness profiles that are regular and exhibit an array of breaks similar to those seen in spirals .",
    "furthermore , we have found regularity and trends in the break parameters , many of which continue into the regime of giant spiral galaxies .",
    "one key feature is that the surface brightness at the break radius in @xmath6 is generally the same over 10 mag in integrated galactic @xmath5 .",
    "the standard deviation is roughly 1  mag , but the interesting point is that there is no trend with @xmath5 ( see the bottom , second panel from the left , of figure  8) .",
    "this may imply something fundamental about the relationship between the break radius and the stellar surface density , perhaps in turn implying a characteristic change in the sf process or efficiency at that radius .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the break , as measured by the difference between the outer and inner projected central surface brightnesses , and the ratio of inner to outer disk scale lengths are also remarkably constant with @xmath5 , again implying a regularity in the nature of the change at the break radius .",
    "however , the surface brightness at the break varies from one band to another , so the constant @xmath18 in @xmath6 may result from competing influences , for example sf and mass redistribution .",
    "interestingly , these behaviors apply to both type ii and iii breaks , even though we might expect different processes to be at play in producing the different profile types . in spite of these regularities",
    ", we do not see any relationship between break type and other galactic parameters , including the presence of bars or integrated sf rate except that bcds , with their centrally concentrated sf activity , are more likely to be type iii than are dim or sm galaxies .",
    "another key feature is the comparison between type ii and iii parameters for both dwarfs and spirals . for dwarfs ,",
    "the inner parameters are very different , the outer parameters are much more similar , and the type ii profiles break roughly twice as far out as the iiis but at roughly the same surface brightness .",
    "figure  [ sumfig ] summarizes these aspects for dwarf profiles by showing : ( 1 ) the type  iii inner profiles are much steeper than their type  ii counterparts , ( 2 ) the type  ii and iii outer profiles are roughly parallel , and ( 3 ) the type iii profiles break closer in than the iis . also , the inner type iii slope is steepest in the blue whereas the reverse is true for the inner type ii slopes , although it is not as pronounced .",
    "note that most bcds have type  iii profiles but the type iii bcds do not stand out specifically from the full type iii sample .",
    "consequently , it seems that all type  iii dwarfs are the same kind of beast where their inner steepening results from sf in their inner parts @xcite .",
    "perhaps bcds are just the brightest or most concentrated population of type iii dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ cartoon ] illustrates these differences between type  ii and iii dwarf profiles as well as their changes with passband .",
    "we have plotted representative @xmath6 and fuv profiles with parameters determined from averages or fits to trends from tables  5 - 8 evaluated at @xmath123 .",
    "the type  iii inner profile has a scale length that increases from the fuv to redder bands , so the slope of the profile is steeper in the fuv and the light falls off more quickly with radius than in @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , for the type  ii inner profile , the slope is shallower in the fuv than in @xmath6 .",
    "the fuv is dominated by young stars formed over the past 200  myrs , while @xmath6 is dominated by older stars formed over the past 1  gyr for on - going sf . thus , these trends with wavelength suggest evolution over time , going from the solid lines to the dashed lines in the figure as a galaxy evolves .",
    "the evolution of the profiles from @xmath6 to fuv for type  ii dwarfs suggests a trend of sf _ depletion _ in the inner disk , making the inner regions shallower . for type",
    "iii inner disks , the trend is just the opposite : increasing central sfr over time , possibly from _ accretion _ , which makes the inner regions steeper .",
    "this interpretation for type  iiis is consistent with a history of interactions or minor mergers ( e.g. , younger et  al.2007 ) that force a central concentration of gas and sf , particularly in bcds which are usually type  iii .",
    "thus , the profile types and their trends with wavelength could be revealing differences in the evolutionary histories among dwarfs .",
    "the outer regions do not change nearly as much with stellar population age or profile type as the inner regions . figure",
    "[ cartoon ] hints that the outer slope is slightly steeper in the fuv than @xmath6 for the type  iis , but that the reverse is true for type  iiis .",
    "these outer wavelength trends are based on data from figure  [ offsets ] where the `` trends '' are very weak and the data are marginally consistent with no trend when the variations in the mean are taken into account .",
    "consequently , the outer trends in figure  [ cartoon ] could be an artifact of the averaging process .",
    "however , if the type  ii steeper outer fuv is real , it would be consistent with long term outside - in shrinking of the outer star - forming disk , as found by @xcite , and contrary to the inside - out paradigm for spirals .",
    "if the type  iii shallower outer fuv is real , it would be inconsistent with the findings of @xcite ; however , this is not surprising since their sample was dominated by type  ii dwarfs .    between type  ii and iii spirals , ( 1 )",
    "the inner parameters are very different ( like dwarfs ) , ( 2 ) the outer parameters differ ( unlike dwarfs ) , but ( 3 ) the profiles break at roughly the same radius ( also unlike dwarfs ) .",
    "the difference between the dwarf and spiral outer profiles may be related to radial migration from interactions with spiral arms @xcite , a mechanism that does not work in dwarfs .",
    "radial color trends should shed some light on this situation .    in subsequent papers",
    ", we will examine correlations between surface brightness breaks and color profiles , compare the breaks with gas surface density profiles , and look at 2d structure in the galaxies and its contribution to the breaks .",
    "after examining these additional aspects , we will be in a better position to discuss what we have learned about the nature of surface brightness breaks and their causes in dwarf galaxies .",

    "<S> radial surface brightness profiles of spiral galaxies are classified into three types : ( i ) single exponential , or the light falls off with one exponential to a break before falling off ( ii ) more steeply , or ( iii ) less steeply . </S>",
    "<S> profile breaks are also found in dwarf disks , but some dwarf type  iis are flat or increasing out to a break before falling off . here </S>",
    "<S> we re - examine the stellar disk profiles of 141 dwarfs : 96 dwarf irregulars ( dims ) , 26 blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ) , and 19 magellanic - type spirals ( sms ) . </S>",
    "<S> we fit single , double , or even triple exponential profiles in up to 11 passbands : @xmath0 fuv and nuv , ground - based @xmath1 and h@xmath2 , and @xmath3 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath4 m . </S>",
    "<S> we find that more luminous galaxies have brighter centers , larger inner and outer scale lengths , and break at larger radii ; dwarf trends with @xmath5 extend to spirals . </S>",
    "<S> however , the @xmath6-band break surface brightness is independent of break type , @xmath5 , and hubble type . </S>",
    "<S> dwarf type  ii and iii profiles fall off similarly beyond the breaks but have different interiors and iis break @xmath7twice as far as iiis . </S>",
    "<S> outer type  ii and iii scale lengths may have weak trends with wavelength , but pure type  ii inner scale lengths clearly @xmath8 from the fuv to visible bands whereas type  iii inner scale lengths @xmath9 with redder bands . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the influence of different star formation histories on profile type , but nonetheless the break location is approximately the same in all passbands . </S>",
    "<S> dwarfs continue trends between profile and hubble types such that later - type galaxies have more type  ii but fewer type  i and iii profiles than early - type spirals . </S>",
    "<S> bcds and sms are over - represented as types  iii and ii , respectively , compared to dims . </S>"
