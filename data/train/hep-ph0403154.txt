    "is there any new physics ( np ) beyond the standard model ( sm ) ? probably yes , if high - energy physics does not want itself to be lost in a mire of unanswered questions .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most widely discussed options of np , in both its r - parity conserving ( rpc ) and r - parity violating ( rpv ) incarnations .",
    "however , susy introduces a plethora of new particles , and even in its most constrained version , a few more arbitrary input parameters over and above to that of the sm .",
    "thus , it has become imperative to constrain the susy parameter space as far as possible from existing data .",
    "there are , of course , direct bounds on the sparticle masses from collider data .",
    "these bounds are typically weaker for rpv susy than for the rpc version , since in the former case the final - state signal is radically different and more possible channels are open . apart from them , there are bounds on the parameter space from low - energy processes , whose amplitudes can be affected by intermediate sparticle states . for rpc susy",
    ", the new amplitudes must be at least at one - loop level , so that they can compete with the sm amplitude and show up only if the sm amplitude is also suppressed .",
    "the new amplitudes may appear at tree - level if r - parity is violated , and hence there is a greater chance of constraining rpv susy models from low - energy data .",
    "there is another good reason to focus upon the rpv version : most of the precision low - energy processes from which one can obtain bounds are flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) type .",
    "now , there are some elegant mechanisms of suppressing fcnc effects in rpc susy , but absolutely none ( except putting some flavor - changing yukawa - type couplings equal to zero , or vanishingly small , by hand ) if we have rpv .",
    "thus , the bounds on the parameter space of rpv susy coming from fcnc processes are in a sense more robust .",
    "in this paper we use the data from @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing to constrain the relevant couplings for rpv susy . for the latter we use both @xmath3 and @xmath4 constraints , while for the former we use the results on @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we do not discuss other cp violating parameters like @xmath7 , since that has large theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we have also discussed some correlated channels leading to leptonic and semileptonic decays .",
    "we do not consider the @xmath8 system since there is only a lower bound on @xmath9 .",
    "this , in turn , means that there is no such upper bound on the relevant np couplings ; we can only have a lower bound , which is consistent with zero .",
    "the situation should change dramatically once the hadronic b machines , producing copious @xmath8 mesons , come on line .",
    "do we have any motivation to invoke np for the k and the b systems ?",
    "in other words , is there any inconsistency of the experimental data with the sm predictions ?",
    "the answer is yes for the b system , though the error bars are still large to draw any definite conclusion ( but we have reasons to be hopeful ) .",
    "the sore thumbs are ( i ) the abnormally high branching ratios ( br ) for the generic channels @xmath10 @xcite , and @xmath11 for flavor eigenstates , @xmath12 for a state whose flavor composition is immaterial , and b for a generic @xmath13 meson . ] ( ii ) the direct cp - asymmetry in the channel @xmath14 as found by belle @xcite , ( iii ) the discrepancy in the extracted value of @xmath4 from @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite , and ( iv ) the so - called `` @xmath17 '' puzzle : the abnormal enhancement of electroweak penguins in @xmath18 decays @xcite .",
    "however , one must not be over - enthusiastic since these channels are nonleptonic and qcd uncertainties are yet to be fully understood .",
    "but one may hope more such anomalies from leptonic and hadronic b - factories . for the k system ,",
    "the nonleptonic channels are notoriously difficult for any systematic analysis of np effects @xcite , but for the first time we are having precise data ( or bound ) on leptonic and semileptonic k decay channels from brookhaven and da@xmath19ne .",
    "it is always better to be ready for any unexpected result .",
    "another motivation for supersymmetry comes from the neutrino mass .",
    "it has been shown that the existence of nonzero neutrino mass may have observable signatures in b - physics @xcite like the enhancement of the @xmath20 amplitude and also @xmath21 , the mass difference between two @xmath8 mass eigenstates , if one assumes some unified rpc susy theory . in rpv susy",
    ", one may have a definite texture at the gut scale ( only a few rpv couplings are nonzero ) and can generate the whole lot of nonzero rpv couplings at the weak scale through renormalization group evolution and ckm - type mixing @xcite .",
    "one expects a signature of those rpv couplings relevant for neutrino mass generation in the b - factory data .",
    "must the rpv couplings be complex ?",
    "the answer is that there is no a priori reason why they should be all real . even if there is some real gut texture",
    ", the weak scale couplings may turn out to be complex .",
    "the phase of one single coupling can be absorbed in the sfermion field , but a nontrivial phase should be there in a product of two such couplings .",
    "effects of rpv susy on k and b physics have been discussed extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "constraints coming from @xmath1 and @xmath2 mixing have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a culmination of the effort in the following sense : ( i ) this is the first time that both sm and all rpv contributions ( including their phases ) have been taken into account for the systems under consideration ; ( ii ) the short - distance qcd corrections have been implemented upto next - to - leading order ( nlo ) accuracy ( there is scope for questioning this procedure for the k system ; this will be discussed later ) ; ( iii ) both cp - conserving and cp - violating constraints have been discussed for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 systems ; ( iv ) some discrepancies in the relevant formulae used in some of the earlier works have been corrected ; and ( v ) correlated signals for leptonic and semileptonic decays have been discussed .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the relevant formulae necessary for the analysis .",
    "section 3 deals with the numerical inputs and section 4 with the analysis of the results .",
    "decay channels mediated by the same couplings are touched upon in section 5 , while we conclude and summarize in section 6 .",
    "some calculational details have been relegated to the two appendices .",
    "let the neutral mesons be generically denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , with the valence quark content @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "for the cases under study , @xmath26 can be either @xmath27 or @xmath28 . for @xmath8 system , replace @xmath26 by @xmath29 and @xmath27 by @xmath28 .    the off - diagonal element in the @xmath30 effective hamiltonian causes the @xmath31 mixing .",
    "the mass difference between the two mass eigenstates @xmath32 is given by ( following the convention of @xcite ) @xmath33 with the approximation @xmath34 .",
    "this , however , is true for the b system only .",
    "let the sm amplitude be @xmath35 where @xmath36 for the @xmath37 system and approximately zero for the @xmath1 ( and also for @xmath38 ) system .",
    "we follow the @xmath39 convention for the unitarity triangle @xcite .",
    "if we have @xmath40 number of np amplitudes with weak phases @xmath41 , one can write @xmath42 as @xmath43 and the mass difference between mass eigenstates as @xmath44^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are going to be our basic formulae .",
    "the only task is to find @xmath45 and @xmath46 .    for the @xmath1 system @xcite",
    ", @xmath47 is non - negligible , and we can write @xmath48^{1/2},\\nonumber\\\\ \\delta \\gamma&=&-4~im\\left [ ( m_{12}-{i\\over 2}\\gamma_{12 } )   ( m^*_{12}-{i\\over 2}\\gamma^*_{12})\\right]^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath49 .",
    "since the dominant decay is to the @xmath50 final state , one can neglect @xmath51 and write @xmath52 the cp - violating parameter @xmath6 is given by @xmath53 which can be written as @xmath54 note that @xmath55 has both short - distance ( sd ) and long - distance ( ld ) contributions .",
    "the ld contribution is not calculable ; what one calculates from the box amplitude is the sd part .",
    "that is why one generally uses the experimental value of @xmath56 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ epsa - k ] ) .    for @xmath1 system ,",
    "the short - distance sm amplitude is @xmath57 where generically @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the k meson decay constant , and @xmath60 ( also called @xmath61 in the literature ) and @xmath62 parametrize the short- and the long - distance qcd corrections , respectively ( @xmath62 is a phenomenological parameter , thrown in to parametrize the ld contribution ) .",
    "the tiny top - quark loop dependent part responsible for cp violation has been neglected .",
    "the function @xmath63 is given by @xmath64 for the @xmath2 system , we have an analogous equation , dominated by the top quark loop : @xmath65 there is not enough motivation to consider the @xmath38 system right now , since there exists only a lower bound on @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this can accomodate arbitrarily large np couplings , starting from zero .",
    "however , if the np amplitude has a nonzero phase , then there will be an effective phase in @xmath38 mixing amplitude , whose presence may be tested in the hadronic b factories . whether there is any detectable new physics in @xmath38 mixing ( this is particularly relevant since the @xmath67 penguin transition , at least for nonleptonic decays , shows hint of an anomalous behaviour )",
    "can be effectively tested in hadronic b machines , which will measure @xmath21 as well as the cp asymmetries in @xmath68 and hopefully @xmath69 .",
    "detection of np signals in the double vector meson modes requires angular analysis of the decay products but hopefully can be done in future colliders @xcite .    in the presence of np ,",
    "the general @xmath70 effective hamiltonian can be written as @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the regularization scale , and @xmath73 where @xmath26 is either @xmath29 or @xmath28 , and @xmath74 .",
    "the subscripts 1 and 8 indicate whether the currents are in color - singlet or in color - octet combination .",
    "the @xmath75s are obtained from corresponding @xmath76s by replacing @xmath77 .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath78 at @xmath79 include np effects , coming from couplings and internal propagators .",
    "however , for most of the np models , and certainly for the case we are discussing here , all np particles are heavier than @xmath80 and hence the running of the coefficients between @xmath80 and @xmath81 are controlled by the sm hamiltonian alone . in other words",
    ", np determines only the boundary conditions of the renormalization group ( rg ) equations . for the evolution of these coefficients down to the low - energy scale , we follow ref .  @xcite , which uses , for @xmath2 mixing , @xmath82 gev .",
    "the low - scale wilson coefficients , using the nlo - qcd corrections , are @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 being the scale of np , which , for susy , may be taken to be the average of the squark and the gluino masses .",
    "we will use @xmath86 gev throughout the paper . for the numerical values of @xmath87 , @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath27 matrices we refer the reader to eq .",
    "( 10 ) of ref.@xcite ( to avoid confusion with the wilson coefficients , we use the symbol @xmath27 for the matrix denoted by @xmath88 in @xcite ) . all the numbers are not relevant for our discussion ; the modification of the np operators due to the short - distance qcd corrections is discussed in section 4 .",
    "it will be shown that only operators @xmath89 and @xmath90 are relevant at the scale @xmath79 , while there is a slight admixture of @xmath91 at the low - energy scale .",
    "the operators @xmath76 are also to be renormalized at the scale @xmath72 .",
    "the expectation values of these operators between @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the scale @xmath72 are given by @xmath94 where @xmath95 the @xmath96-parameters , whose numerical values are given in section 3 , have been taken from @xcite .",
    "note that the expectation values are scaled by factor of @xmath97 over those given in some literature due to our different normalization of the meson wavefunctions .",
    "it is trivial to check that both conventions yield the same values for physical observables .",
    "analogous expressions follow for the @xmath1 system , with @xmath98 , and @xmath99 with @xmath100 gev .",
    "the running of the wilson coefficients is given by an equation which is exactly analogous to eq .",
    "( [ running - b ] ) @xcite but with different @xmath87 , @xmath29 and @xmath27 matrices , which are evaluated at @xmath101 gev .",
    "the @xmath96-parameters , which include all nonperturbative effects below the scale @xmath72 , are different too .",
    "it is noteworthy that the nlo corrections as discussed above can not be applied when there are light quarks like @xmath102 flowing in the loop , since the operator product expansion takes a different form @xcite .",
    "this will be the case when we switch on the rpv interaction .",
    "there should be an enhancement coming from large logarithms ; however , this puts on a tighter constraint on the rpv couplings .",
    "since these qcd corrections are not known , we use the same procedure as adopted for heavy particles , and probably deduce somewhat lenient constraints on the parameter space for those particular couplings .",
    "it is clear from equations ( [ k - sm ] ) and ( [ b - sm ] ) that at least in the sm , one can either evaluate the matrix element of @xmath103 at @xmath80 and compute the running to the low energy scale , or alternatively can use the parameters @xmath104 and @xmath105 , to be determined from the lattice studies .",
    "we adopt the latter method for calculating the sm amplitudes , scanning over the whole range of these parameters , so that even the nonperturbative effects can be successfully taken into account , including all the uncertainties .",
    "this gives us the most conservative bounds on the np parameters .",
    "the np amplitude is calculated using the former method .",
    "r - parity is a global quantum number , defined as @xmath106 , which is @xmath107 for all particles and @xmath108 for all superparticles . in the minimal version of supersymmetry and some of its variants , r - parity",
    "is assumed to be conserved _",
    "ad hoc _ , which prevents single creation or annihilation of superparticles .",
    "such models have a natural candidate for dark matter , and have telltale signatures in collider searches as large missing energy .",
    "however , models with broken r - parity can be constructed naturally , and such models have a number of interesting phenomenological consequences @xcite . some of these r - parity violating models can be motivated from an underlying gut framework @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in order to avoid rapid proton decay one can not have both lepton number and baryon number violating rpv couplings , and we shall work with a lepton number violating model .",
    "this leads to both slepton ( charged and neutral ) and squark mediated decays , and new amplitudes for @xmath31 mixing , where particles flowing inside the box can be ( i ) charged sleptons and up - type quarks , ( ii ) sneutrino and down type quarks , ( iii ) squarks and leptons . one or both of the scalar particles inside the box can be replaced by @xmath109 bosons , charged higgs bosons and goldstone bosons ( in a non - unitary gauge ) ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we follow the usual practice of avoiding the so - called `` pure susy '' contributions to the box amplitudes , _",
    "i.e. _ , those coming from charginos , neutralinos or gluinos inside the loop .",
    "not only the strongly interacting superparticles are expected to be heavier than the electroweak ones ( and hence the contribution being suppressed ) , but also one can choose susy models where these contributions become negligible ( _ e.g. _ , alignment in the squark sector , or higgsino - dominated lighter chargino , to kill off the respective boxes . ) since the current lower bound on the slepton mass is generally weaker than that on squark mass by a factor 2 - 3 , the slepton mediated boxes have greater chance to be numerically significant .",
    "we start with the superpotential @xmath110 where @xmath111 are quark and lepton generation indices ; @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the @xmath114-doublet lepton and quark superfields and @xmath115 is the @xmath114-singlet down - type quark superfield respectively . written in terms of component fields ,",
    "this superpotential generates six terms , plus their hermitian conjugates :    @xmath116 + h.c.\\ ] ]    with such a term , one can have two different kind of boxes , shown in fig .  1 , that contribute to @xmath31 mixing : first , the one where one has two sfermions flowing inside the loop , alongwith two sm fermions @xcite , and secondly , the one where one slepton , one @xmath109 ( or charged higgs or goldstone ) and two up - type quarks complete the loop @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the first amplitude is proportional to the product of four @xmath117 type couplings , and the second to the product of two @xmath117 type couplings times @xmath118 .",
    "we call them l4 and l2 boxes , respectively , for brevity , where l is a shorthand for @xmath119",
    ".    we will constrain only products of two @xmath117-type couplings at a time , and assume a hierarchical structure , _",
    "i.e. _ , only one product is , for all practical purpose , simultaneously nonzero ( but can have a nontrivial phase )",
    ". this may not be physically the most appealing scenario but keeps the discussion free from unnecessary complications .",
    "for any product , there are individual bounds on each of them , the product of which we call the direct product bound ( dpb ) .",
    "interesting bounds are those which are numerically smaller , and hence stronger , than the corresponding dpbs , the more the better .",
    "this turns out to be the case for almost all the products .",
    "a list of the individual bounds at the weak scale can be found in @xcite .    at this point ,",
    "let us clarify how the bounds are obtained .",
    "there are , generically , three boxes : sm , l2 and l4 . for l2 boxes , one can have same or different up - type quarks flowing inside the loop . for the former case , there is also an l4 counterpart , _",
    "i.e. _ , the coupling that gives rise to the l2 box can also generate an l4 box .",
    "the operator for the l2 box is @xmath90 , while that for the l4 box is @xmath89 .",
    "the rg evolution generates a small @xmath91 admixture to @xmath90 at the low - energy scale , while @xmath89 is just multiplicatively renormalized .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is obtained from a coherent sum of these three amplitudes , and there can be intricate interference patterns depending on the magnitudes and the phases of them . a general trend , however , is easy to follow .",
    "the pure sm part is proportional to @xmath120 times some ckm factor .",
    "the l2 box is proportional to @xmath121 , and the l4 box goes as @xmath122 . for small values of the @xmath123 coupling ,",
    "l2 contribution dominates over l4 , and the `` bound '' ( as obtained by @xcite ) is controlled by l2 .",
    "we will see that if the phases are included , this procedure does not give the bounds , so the numbers obtained in this way are not listed in tables 1 and 2 . for larger values of the coupling ,",
    "l4 becomes dominant , and if there happens to be a cancellation between sm and l2 amplitudes , l4 controls the show .",
    "that is , the solution describes a contour in the @xmath124 plane .",
    "there are certain points , far from the origin , where there happens to be a complete destructive interference between sm and l2 boxes .",
    "thus , if the product has an arbitray phase , it is always the l4 term that gives the bound when the quarks inside are the same .",
    "we will see explicit examples of this later .",
    "if the up - type quarks in the box are different , there is no corresponding l4 contribution ( actually , there is , but that comes from four different @xmath117 type couplings which we neglect systematically ) , and the treatment becomes simpler .    a note of caution here . in the literature ,",
    "most of the bounds on the rpv couplings are not absolute , but scale with the corresponding sfermion mass that comes in the propagator . for a product coupling , the dependence is typically @xmath125 .",
    "the results are usually quoted for @xmath126 gev , and bounds for higher @xmath127 are straightforward to obtain .",
    "however , for the l4 boxes , there can be two distinct type of amplitudes , one through a quark - slepton box , and the other through a squark - lepton box . for our analysis",
    ", we take all sleptons to be degenerate at 100 gev , and all squarks to be degenerate at 300 gev ( 100 gev squarks are already ruled out ) .",
    "thus , it is not easy to scale the bounds quickly ; a good way is to remember ( and scale accordingly ) that at the amplitude level , the squark contribution is about 10% of the slepton contribution , and the second way , to get a more rough scaling , is to neglect the squark contribution altogether .",
    "= 4.5 cm    the effective hamiltonian for the l4 box has been computed in @xcite , with degenerate sfermions . for a nondegenerate case ,",
    "the expression reads ( @xmath128 for @xmath1 and @xmath129 for @xmath2 boxes ) @xmath130\\tilde{o_1}\\nonumber\\\\ & { } & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath131 with @xmath132 , which justifies the omission of this function in the last term , where we have explicitly assumed all leptons to be massless .",
    "in fact , this is also a reasonable assumption for all quarks except the top quark",
    ".    there may be another l4-type amplitude , with left - handed quarks as external legs and right - handed down - type squarks and neutrinos ( and quarks and sneutrinos too ) flowing inside the box . neglecting the fermion masses",
    ", the effective hamiltonian reads @xmath133\\tilde{o_1}.\\ ] ] note that this bounds a different combination . as we will see soon , there is a corresponding l2 box with the same coupling as in @xmath134 , but none for @xmath135 .",
    "( the reason is simple : @xmath109-bosons couple only to left - chiral quarks , and scalar couplings are negligible . )",
    "thus , all @xmath136 combinations are expected to yield the same bound .",
    "the case for the l2 box is more complicated . a simplified treatment , keeping all bosons ( sleptons , ws , and higgs bosons ) to be degenerate at 100 gev , neglecting the qcd corrections , and saturating the experimental number with rpv amplitude alone , was given in @xcite .",
    "only real rpv couplings were considered since there was no data for cp violation in the b system at that time .",
    "we improve the calculation by incorporating all the above factors , but note that the bounds quoted in @xcite for @xmath137 are still surprisingly close to the mark .",
    "in fact , with the introduction of rpv phases , the possibility of destructive interference between the amplitudes opens up , and one would have expected a weaker bound than in @xcite .",
    "consideration of the cp violating parameters @xmath138 and @xmath6 helps us to put a tighter set of constraints .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , in this approximation , is given by @xmath139 o_4,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 , and @xmath141 and @xmath142 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs bosons that give mass to the down- and the up - type quarks respectively ( not to be confused with the phase of @xmath143 ) .",
    "for nondegenerate masses the expression is expectedly more complicated : @xmath144 o_4,\\nonumber\\\\ & { } & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145s are factors that come out of the box diagram integration ( the superscripts indicate the sm boson in the loop ) .",
    "note that as expected , the higgs- and goldstone - box contributions are negligible for @xmath146 . the expressions for these factors in t hooft - feynman gauge",
    "are given in appendix a.    the hamiltonian is slightly modified if we consider two different up - type quarks @xmath147 and @xmath148 inside the loop : @xmath149o_4,\\nonumber\\\\ & { } & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and again the integration factors @xmath150 are shown explicitly in appendix a. note that the hamiltonian is evaluated at @xmath79 and the matrix elements are to be evaluated at the proper low - energy scale .",
    "apart from these new amplitudes , there are a number of other boxes , a detailed list of which is given in appendix b , which are proportional to four @xmath119 type couplings",
    ". they may be important in a scheme with a definite texture for such couplings , but for our present study , we do not consider them any further .",

    "the theoretical prediction of @xmath4 , obtained from a fit excluding the direct experimental results , is taken from @xcite : @xmath160 we also use @xcite @xmath161    this brings us to the only possible caveat of our analysis .",

    ", we assume only one rpv product coupling to be nonzero at a time .",
    "we take all sleptons to be degenerate at 100 gev , and all squarks at 300 gev .",
    "we also take @xmath177 ( very low values are excluded by lep , and the numbers are not sensitive to the precise choice of @xmath178 ) , and the charged higgs boson mass as 200 gev ( lower values are disfavored from @xmath179 ) .",
    "our bounds are summarized in tables 1 and 2 , for the k and the b systems respectively .",
    "the procedure has been outlined in section 2 , and is identical for both systems . however , for the @xmath1 system , the sd contribution may not be the full story . if the sd contribution is smaller , the contribution to @xmath5 is also smaller , and hence the analysis runs for a smaller @xmath5 and gives tighter bounds on the relevant rpv couplings .",
    "the bounds we obtain are , therefore , the most lenient ones .",
    "it appears that the constraints on the @xmath1 system are essentially controlled by @xmath6 , particularly when we allow for complex rpv couplings . in the sm ,",
    "the cp violating part is suppressed by the ckm factors ; with rpv there is no such suppression , and thus one gets tight constraints .",
    "they are shown in the third and fourth columns of table 1 .",
    "the second column shows the constraints for real rpv couplings .",
    "unless the l2 box contains a ckm phase , the imaginary part coming from rpv is zero , and there is no bound coming from @xmath6 ; the only constraint is that coming from @xmath5 .",
    "these entries have been marked with a dagger .    for the @xmath2 system",
    ", one noteworthy thing is that the bounds on the real and the imaginary parts of any product coupling are almost the same .",
    "( that is why we show only the real part ; the same bound applies to the imaginary part too .",
    "we found it to differ by at most 10% in a few cases . )",
    "this is , of course , no numerical accident . to understand this ,",
    "let us analyze the origin of these bounds .",
    "there are two main constraints for the b system : @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "there will be a region , centered around the origin ( since @xmath3 can be explained by the sm alone ) of @xmath180 plane , where @xmath181 is small and the phase can be arbitrary .",
    "this is the sm - dominated region , where rpv creeps in to whatever place is left available . a conventional analysis , taking",
    "both sm and rpv but assuming incoherent sum of amplitudes , should generate this region only .",
    ".bounds on @xmath156 combinations from @xmath1 mixing and @xmath6 , shown for cases when the product is strictly real and when the product may be complex .",
    "the table displays the magnitudes only , and not the signs .",
    "weakest dpbs , displayed in the last column , occur for @xmath182 .",
    "they are from @xcite except that we scale them for 300 gev squarks wherever necessary , unless they hit the perturbative bound .",
    "the entries marked with a dagger are bounded from @xmath5 , see text .",
    "the one marked with a double dagger is bounded from tree - level @xmath1 mixing , and those marked with a @xmath183 have bounds of the order of @xmath184 from squark - mediated @xmath185 ( see text ) .
