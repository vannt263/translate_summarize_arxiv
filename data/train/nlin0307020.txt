    "as in the preceding paper @xcite ( paper i ) , we study maps of the phase plane , which have an unstable fixed point ( an -point ) and an associated homoclinic tangle of stable and unstable manifolds ( fig .",
    "[ fpsp ] ) .",
    "the stable and unstable manifolds intersect transversely , bounding a region of phase space ( called the `` complex '' ) from which a trajectory may or may not escape .",
    "we consider an initial distribution of points along a curve passing through the complex ( the line of initial conditions ) .",
    "the escape - time plot is the number of iterates of the map required for a point to escape the complex , plotted as a function along the line of initial conditions ( fig .",
    "[ fetp ] ) . for chaotic systems ,",
    "such escape - time plots have a complicated set of singularities and structure at all levels of resolution @xcite .",
    "these fractal escape - time plots play a central role in a variety of classical decay and scattering problems ; we have been particularly motivated by the ionization of atoms , especially hydrogen in parallel electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the escape - time plot of a discrete map is divided into `` escape segments '' , intervals over which the escape time is constant . in paper",
    "i , we proved that there exist certain important sequences of consecutive escape segments , which we called epistrophes , at all levels of resolution .",
    "the epistrophes are characterized by the epistrophe theorem , whose core results are : ( 1 ) each endpoint of an escape segment spawns a new epistrophe which converges upon it ; ( 2 ) in the limit @xmath2 , every epistrophe converges geometrically , with rate equal to the liapunov factor @xmath3 of the -point ; ( 3 ) the asymptotic tails of any two epistrophes differ by a simple scaling .",
    "the focus of paper i was the asymptotic behavior of epistrophes . in the present paper ,",
    "we address how epistrophes begin .",
    "we use the topological structure of the homoclinic tangle and the line of initial conditions to show that there is a certain minimal set of escape segments . for this",
    "minimal set , we prove the epistrophe start rule ( theorem [ t1 ] ) , which says that after a sufficiently large time , each epistrophe begins some number of iterates @xmath4 after the segment that spawned it ( i.e. the segment upon which the epistrophe converges . ) the number @xmath4 is the same for all epistrophes of a given map and is dependent on the topological structure of the tangle ; explicitly , @xmath5 , where @xmath1 is the minimum delay time of the complex , that is , the minimum number of iterates a scattering trajectory spends inside the complex . the bulk of our effort is devoted to developing an algebraic algorithm for constructing the minimal set of escape segments for a general line of initial conditions .",
    "this algorithm allows us to compute the initial structure of the escape - time plot for iterates before the epistrophe start rule sets in .",
    "the algorithm is then used to prove the epistrophe start rule itself .",
    "a critical aspect of this paper is our use of homotopy theory .",
    "we develop the necessary formalism in sect .",
    "[ shld ] , and prior knowledge of homotopy theory is not required .",
    "homotopy theory provides an algebraic framework for describing the topological structure of curves in the phase plane .",
    "as we shall explain , the phase plane has a set of `` holes '' into which the line of initial conditions can not pass .",
    "a symbol sequence can be used to describe how the line circumvents these holes .",
    "as the dynamics maps the line forward , there is an induced dynamics on the symbol sequence , representing a new kind of symbolic dynamics which we call `` homotopic lobe dynamics '' . from the symbol sequence",
    ", one can readily read off the structure of the minimal set of escape segments .",
    "lines with different symbol sequences may have different minimal sets ; however , at long enough times , these minimal sets always obey the epistrophe start rule .    some escape segments , such as that marked with an asterisk in fig .",
    "[ fetp ] , are not within the minimal set guaranteed by the topology .",
    "these segments are `` surprises '' which , within the present topological analysis , we can not predict . since they break the regular structure and since they often have no obvious connection with any of the epistrophes , we call them `` strophes '' as in sect .",
    "iiib of paper i. strophes interfere with the self - similar structure of the fractal and typically do not go away in the asymptotic limit , resulting in what we called `` epistrophic self - similarity '' in sect .",
    "iiic of paper i. despite the presence of these strophes , the minimal set often seems to accurately describe the early and intermediate time structure of the escape - time plot .",
    "patterns similar to our epistrophe start rule have been seen in other work . in the numerical study of tiyapan and jaff@xcite , epistrophes and the epistrophe start rule are evident in the structure of the initial angle - final action plot ( analogous to the escape - time plot ) .",
    "similarly , jung and coworkers @xcite used symbolic dynamics to construct a tree - diagram that gives a comparable description of a scattering system . in each case , the authors consider a specific line of initial conditions that is far outside of the complex and is topologically simple .",
    "easton @xcite , followed by rom - kedar and others @xcite , showed that recursive patterns also apply to homoclinic intersections between the stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "thus , it may not be surprising that comparable patterns should apply to the intersections between the stable manifold and an arbitrary line of initial conditions , at least at sufficiently large iterate . but at what iterate does this pattern set in , and what is the minimal set before it sets in ?",
    "algorithm [ a1 ] answers both these questions , as well as giving a simple proof of the epistrophe start rule .",
    "an important observation is that the escape - time plot depends both on the topology of the tangle and on the topology of the line of initial conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    ". figure [ fpsp ] shows a phase space portrait for this map , along with the line of initial conditions @xmath10 considered here .",

    "we review the basic picture of phase space transport described in paper i and refs .",
    "the map @xmath6 has an unstable fixed point ( -point ) denoted @xmath11 and having liapunov factor @xmath12 , which is the larger of the two eigenvalues of @xmath6 linearized about @xmath11 .",

    "the forward and backward iterates @xmath16 are homoclinic intersections with the same sense as @xmath15 .",
    "the homoclinic intersection @xmath17 and its iterates @xmath18 have the opposite sense .",
    "the _ escape zone _",
    "@xmath19 is the lobe bounded by the segments of @xmath13 and @xmath14 joining @xmath15 to @xmath17 .",
    "it maps forward to the lobes @xmath20 , @xmath21 , which all lie outside the complex , and backward to the lobes @xmath22 , @xmath23 , which all intersect the complex .",

    "the escape zone @xmath29 maps from inside to outside the complex and the capture zone @xmath24 maps from outside to inside the complex ; the lobes @xmath29 and @xmath24 together form what is called a _ turnstile _",
    "it is important to emphasize that all points which escape in @xmath30 iterates lie in the escape zone @xmath22 .    in the escape - time plot shown in fig .",
    "[ fetp ] , the number of iterates @xmath31 to escape is plotted as a function along the line of initial conditions @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fetp ] is analogous to fig .  2 of paper i , but for a different choice of @xmath10 .",
    "for a given @xmath31 , the set of escaping points is partitioned into open intervals called _ escape segments _ ; an escape segment is one connected component of @xmath32 .",
    "for example , the first three escape segments at @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fetp ] correspond to the three intersections of @xmath10 with the lobes @xmath22 , @xmath34 , shown in fig .",

    "the epistrophe theorem of paper i says that the escape - time plot contains sequences of escape segments , called epistrophes .",
    "several epistrophes are denoted by arrows in fig .",
    "the first epistrophe starts at @xmath35 and converges monotonically upward , containing one escape segment for each @xmath36 .",
    "a second epistrophe begins at @xmath37 and converges downward upon the endpoint of the @xmath35 segment .",
    "we say that the @xmath35 segment `` spawns '' this epistrophe .",

    "[ sesr ] . in general ,",

    "[ sgroupoid ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath43 in fig .",

    "similarly , all segments of the epistrophes spawned by the @xmath50 segments have winding number @xmath51 . the data in fig .  [ fetp ] thus suggests that all segments of an epistrophe have the same winding number and that this number is one greater than the winding number of the segment which spawned the epistrophe .",
    "this rule will be precisely formulated and proved in a separate publication .",
    "we introduce a new kind of symbolic dynamics , where the symbol sequences refer to paths in the plane ( rather than trajectories of the map . )",
    "this symbolic dynamics allows us to identify and describe a minimal set of escape segments along an arbitrary line of initial conditions .",
    "the theory of homotopy is central to our development  @xcite .",
    "homotopy theory allows us to ignore the detailed positions of the stable and unstable manifolds and concentrate instead on their global topological structure .",
