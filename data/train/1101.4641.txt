    "we investigate each of these possibilities in turn .",
    "the measurement of the column densities of @xmath1 and @xmath2 of h@xmath3 is performed by profile fitting to spectra of the lyman ( @xmath100-@xmath101 ) band in the ultraviolet , recorded with copernicus or fuse .",
    "the h@xmath3 transitions are optically thick , and are completely opaque in the line cores . given the difficulties in accurately retrieving column densities from optically thick transitions , one might worry that the inferred @xmath0 is contaminated by uncertainties caused by radiative transfer .",
    "according to b.  l.  rachford ( private communication , 2010 ) , the detailed shape of the combined profile of the @xmath1 line and the two @xmath2 lines is quite sensitive to the ratio of the column densities of these two rotational levels , and thus provides a very useful probe of @xmath0 .",
    "because multiple vibronic bands of h@xmath3 , which are known to be relatively free of contamination by stellar lines , are used in the determination of @xmath0 , it is difficult to envision any systematic errors that could affect the measurements .",
    "the statistical errors in the column density measurements are typically @xmath40.1 dex , and we can therefore conclude that the ultraviolet measurements provide an accurate and fairly precise measure of the ratio of @xmath21 to @xmath22 for h@xmath3 .",

    "since h@xmath3 is formed in a highly exothermic reaction on grain surfaces , its nascent rotational ( and spin ) distribution is presumed to represent a high temperature @xcite . in the high temperature limit",
    ", h@xmath3 should be formed with an _",
    "ortho_:_para _  ratio of 3:1 .",
    "if an insufficient number of reactive collisions occur between the formation of an h@xmath3 molecule and its subsequent destruction ( by photodissociation or cosmic - ray ionization ) , then the average _ ortho_:_para",

    "if some of the h@xmath3 resides in hotter , mostly atomic gas where h@xmath6 is not abundant , that hot h@xmath3 would cause the observed line - of - sight @xmath0 to exceed @xmath0 in the molecular cloud .",
    "we expect that such contamination would not be a major effect , as h@xmath3 is known to self - shield very effectively from the interstellar radiation field ; thus , the amount of h@xmath3 in primarily atomic ( and presumably warmer ) gas is likely to be quite small compared to the amount of h@xmath3 in the molecular cloud itself .    to estimate the magnitude of this effect more quantitatively , we take a simple cloud model with a hotter outer region and cooler inner region .",

    "we then computed the line - of - sight @xmath0 that would be derived considering both regions of gas .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in figure [ figt01los ] .",
    "taking the diffuse cloud model of @xcite with a constant density ( @xmath142  @xmath137 ) and standard uv radiation field ( @xmath143 ) illuminating the cloud from one side , we then determined the amount of h@xmath3 expected to be in the outer region for comparison with observed h@xmath3 column densities in diffuse clouds .",
    "we define the transition from the outer to inner regions to be at @xmath144 ( @xmath145  @xmath25 ) , about half of the total color excess ( hydrogen column density ) found to supply self - shielding effects in h@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "integrating @xmath146 in the outer region gives @xmath147  @xmath25 .",
    "because this model effectively only treats one side of a cloud , we compare this value to half of the total h@xmath3 column densities reported in table [ tblresults ] .",
    "the two extreme cases are hd 110432 and hd 154368 , where the outer region accounts for about 1/4 and 1/12 of the total cloud , respectively . taking the observed values of @xmath0 and using the appropriate curves on figure 2 , we estimate the temperature of the inner cloud region for each of the 5 sight lines considered herein .",
    "the results are marked in figure 2 as cross hairs , and show that the line - of - sight values of @xmath0 overestimate the inferred inner cloud values of @xmath0 by only about 510 k. as such , the observed values of @xmath0 should be relatively close to the true values of @xmath0 in molecular clouds .",
    "we therefore assume for the remainder of this paper that the line of sight @xmath0 does represent the diffuse molecular cloud kinetic temperature .      from the preceding discussions , we conclude that uv measurements accurately measure the column densities of @xmath1 and @xmath2 of h@xmath3 in diffuse clouds , that the chemical reaction between h@xmath98 and h@xmath3 occurs @xmath148 times during the life of an average h@xmath3 , and that the steady state of this chemical reaction leads to an _",

    "we therefore judge these rate coefficients to be reliable within the context of this theoretical approach .",
    "the park & light code ( provided by k. park , private communication 2009 ) requires five input parameters : the kinetic temperature , the rotational temperature of h@xmath6  and h@xmath3 , and the three branching fractions @xmath178 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 . for these calculations ,",

    "an interesting aspect of these results is that the steady state @xmath64 at some temperatures is actually _ below _ the value of 0.5 expected based on statistical weights alone ( often called the `` high - temperature limit '' ) .",
    "this appears to be a robust result for @xmath193 , at least in the range of @xmath178 explored here .",

    "we derive a more complete steady state expression ( equation [ ssp3 ] ) including the effects of both the h@xmath6 + h@xmath3 reaction and nuclear - spin - dependent dr rates ( @xmath217 and @xmath218 for _",
