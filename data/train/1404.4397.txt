    "another important feature of the helical dirac fermions observed in topological insulators is that the fermi contours are circular for small values of the chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) in the conduction band and acquire a snowflake @xcite shape as @xmath2 increases .",
    "this has been assigned by fu @xcite to a hexagonal warping term in the hamiltonian of such charge carriers .",
    "this term has a strong signature in the optical conductivity .",
    "@xcite the usual flat background @xcite associated with the interband transitions in graphene is predicted to show instead a large near linear increase with photon energy above the interband threshold .",
    "it is also possible to introduce a gap in the helical electrons by magnetic doping @xcite of the surface states to break time reversal symmetry and thus produce massive dirac fermions in @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite finally we note that the dirac spectrum at the surface of a ti usually displays considerable particle - hole asymmetry which can be modeled with a small sub - dominant schrdinger quadratic in momentum kinetic energy piece to the hamiltonian which is in addition to the dominant dirac piece .",
    "the asymmetry provides an hourglass or goblet shape to the valence band dispersion curves . @xcite",
    "while perhaps small , the schrdinger piece has been shown to provide important modifications @xcite in the magneto optics of such systems as compared with what is found in graphene @xcite or the related single layer silicene .",
    "@xcite in this paper we will be primarily interested in the effect of hexagonal warping on the berry curvature , orbital magnetic moment , berry phase , in and out of plane spin texture , matrix elements for optical absorption and on the circular dichroism , we will also consider the effect of including a gap as a primary element and of a subdominant non relativistic schrdinger contribution to the hamiltonian .",

    "berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment are described .",
    "section iii considers the berry phase of such a system and in particular how it is changed by the warping and quadratic in momentum schrdinger term .",

    "section v describes optical absorption of circular polarized light and dichroism .",

    "when a hexagonal warping term of @xmath196 is included we obtain the red curve which shows that the dichroism is greatly reduced over its isotropic value and is very small for values of @xmath2 greater than about @xmath197 . if however , in addition to the warping we include a schrdinger term with @xmath198 ( with @xmath199 the bare electron mass ) we obtain the green dashed curve which has moved closer to the isotropic results than is the case for the red curve .",

    "both decrease monotonically with increasing @xmath2 but in all cases there are significant quantitative differences and contrary to what was found before when spin and berry phase were compared the dichroism does not translate directly into a quantitative measure of @xmath204 . here",

    "similar issues arise and have been studied extensively when spin polarized angular resolved photoemission is considered .",

    "first , hexagonal warping leads to an increasing absorption for @xmath231 greater than its threshold value in the solid curves for right circular polarized light @xmath232 ( top frame ) in contrast to the case without warping ( bottom frame ) where a decreasing absorption is seen .",
    "note that for @xmath233 the absorption edge is determined by the gap and falls at @xmath234 .",
    "for @xmath230 it is at @xmath235 .",
    "for left circular polarized light it is the dotted curves which arise and here again the absorption rises more sharply when hexagonal warping is included .",
    "the curves with warping are concave up while those without are concave down .",
    "a second feature that we wish to emphasize is that the degree of dichroism is significantly affected by hexagonal warping .",
    "for example in the red curves just above threshold at @xmath236 , the ratio of the absorption from right to left polarized light is about @xmath237 when we neglect warping while it decreases to @xmath238 with warping .",
    "the ratio of the difference between @xmath232 and @xmath228 normalized to its sum is related to the hall angle and is given by @xmath239 this ratio is shown as the open circles in fig .  [ fig10 ] as a function of photon energy @xmath231 for the parameters used in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] namely , a gap @xmath59 , a chemical potential @xmath230 and a hexagonal warping parameter @xmath240 .",
    "the dichroism is seen to decrease with increasing @xmath241 and has its maximum above the main interband absorption edge of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] at @xmath242 , where the ratio in ( [ ratio ] ) is about 0.6 .",

    "( [ eta ] ) and ( [ ome ] ) , we get for @xmath245 the black dashed curve which does not agree well with the open circles . in particular note that these differ by a factor of 2 at @xmath246 . on the other hand near perfect agreement",
    "is obtained when @xmath247 and @xmath248 are separately averaged before their ratio is taken which gives the solid red curve .",
    "it is clear from this comparison that @xmath249 is not a good measure of the dichroism when there is hexagonal warping . in this case numerator and denominator in the first equality in ( [ degree ] ) need to be separately averaged and then their ratio taken .",
    "we make one final point .",

    "( [ curve ] ) .",
    "if we place the chemical potential at @xmath229 i.e. to fall in the gap the integral for the hall conductivity reduce to that given in eq .",
    "( [ phase ] ) for the berry phase where the integral goes to infinity .",
    "this gives @xmath252 which shows that the hexagonal warping term leaves the quantized value of the hall conductivity unchanged as we expect .",
    "the presence of an hexagonal warping term in the hamiltonian for the helical dirac electrons at the surface of a topological insulator changes the fermi surface to a snowflake shape at large values of chemical potential from a circle at small values .",
    "here we showed how this term changes the orbital magnetic moment when a gap is also included . without warping ,",
    "the orbital magnetic moment @xmath253 is isotropic in momentum space and directly proportional to the gap @xmath177 . with warping and",
    "no gap @xmath254 is non - zero but its value depends on the angle of @xmath1 in the 2-d surface states brillouin zone with lines of zero along 3 directions , @xmath49 , @xmath255 thus changing sign six times .",
    "its angular average at fix absolute value of momentum @xmath1 however vanishes . with a gap",
    "this cancelation no longer holds and @xmath254 recovers the behavior it has when there is no warping as long as @xmath1 is small . as @xmath1 increases isotropy is lost and there are three contours along which @xmath256 becomes zero and on crossing one of these contours there is a change in sign .",
    "hexagonal warping , as does the presence of a gap , changes the berry curvature and consequently the berry phase around a constant energy contour . without warping ,",
    "a known result is that a gap reduces the berry phase .",
    "here we show that this effect is reduced when there is warping and the phase returns to a value close to @xmath47 as the strength of the warping @xmath60 is increased .",
    "the spin texture is also changed .",
    "the component of the spin in the @xmath1 plane remains locked perpendicular to its momentum but now its magnitude is no longer @xmath257 as it is when the gap is zero but now varies with angle as well as with the magnitude of @xmath1 . with a gap but no warping @xmath79 , the pattern is isotropic in @xmath258 space with magnitude of the spin in the ( @xmath259 ) plane starting from zero at @xmath56 and increasing to @xmath257 at large @xmath72 such that @xmath260 . for @xmath60",
    "non zero the spin pattern is anisotropic and depends on angle although it still starts at zero for @xmath56 and is isotropic in this limit .",
    "but as k increases , the pattern becomes anisotropic and at large value of @xmath72 it tends towards zero rather than saturate to one half as for the @xmath79 case .",
    "the @xmath261-component of spin follows a complimentary pattern as the total spin must be @xmath257 . without warping but with a gap ,",
    "the value of @xmath112 starts at @xmath262 at @xmath56 , drops towards zero at large @xmath72 and is isotropic independent of the angle of @xmath1 .",
    "for the finite @xmath60 case however the magnitude of @xmath112 can become zero as the magnitude of @xmath1 increases in certain directions and can change sign .",
    "in other directions there is no zero and no sign changes .",
    "thus warping introduces a rich spin texture not present when it is neglected .",
    "we find that the fermi surface average of the z - component of spin provides a quantitative measure of the berry phase in all cases considered here .",
    "this holds for warping as well as well as inclusion of a subdominant non relativistic quadratic in momentum schrdinger term in the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in addition to the dominant relativistic dirac term .",
    "this piece introduces particle hole asymmetry and provides corrections to both berry phase and spin texture .",
    "the degree of circular dichroism is changed by the warping , as is the square of the optical matrix element for interband absorption .",
    "the degree of circular polarization is defined as the normalized difference between right and left hand such interband matrix elements .",
    "it follows closely the pattern in @xmath1 space established for the orbital magnetic moment .",
    "in fact it is proportional to @xmath254 with an additional denominator which modulates its behavior slightly but provides no important qualitative changes .",
    "these effects translate into changes in the frequency dependent ac interband conductivity .",
    "both longitudinal and transverse ( hall ) conductivity are altered and the degree of dichroism is decreased .",
    "for example for a warping of @xmath263 , a gap of @xmath59 and a chemical potential @xmath230 , the ratio of the absorption from right to left polarized light just above the absorption threshold decreases from 8 to 4 . in discussions of dichroism",
    "it is customary to relate it to the ratio of the optical matrix elements defined in eq .",
    "( 38 ) and consider its dependence on momentum @xmath1 .",
    "here however @xmath264 is an angular dependent quantity and so averaging this ratio as in eq .",
    "( 39 ) gives a different answer than averaging numerator and denominator separately as in eq .",
    "( 40 ) before taking their ratio .",
    "we find that it is this second procedure that needs to be used to get quantitative measure of the dichroism .",
    "another results is that while the dichroism is found to correlate qualitatively with the constant energy surface average of the z - component of spin , the correspondence between these two quantities is not quantitative while it is between the berry phase and @xmath265    as has been stressed recently by wright and mckenzie and others @xcite an essential element of topological insulator surface states is the existence of particle - hole asymmetry which results from the presence of a quadratic in momentum schrdinger contribution to the hamiltonian .",
    "this term does not change the wave function although it modifies the energy .",
    "thus the berry curvature , orbital magnetic moment and spin texture at zero temperature are unaffected . on the other hand",
    "a quantity that is averaged over a constant energy contour such as the berry phase or fermi surface averaged z - component of spin is changed because the contour itself depends on the schrdinger contribution to the energy .",
    "nonetheless the dc hall conductivity remains quantized and unchanged at a value of @xmath266 when the chemical potential @xmath229 falls in the gap .",
    "this is also true for the warping which modifies the berry curvature but leaves the value of the dc hall unchanged .",
