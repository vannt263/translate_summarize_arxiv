    "this work addresses the problem of extending the basic results of the the theory of hopf algebras to the context of autonomous pseudomonoids",
    ". we will focus mainly on two constructions : hopf modules and the drinfeld double of a hopf algebra .",
    "left autonomous pseudomonoids , introduced in @xcite , generalise not only hopf and ( co)quasi - hopf algebras but also ( pro)monoidal enriched categories .",
    "in fact , this is the conceptual reason underlying the well - known fact that the category of finite - dimensional ( co)representations of a ( co)quasi - hopf algebra is left autonomous .",
    "our starting point is the so - called _ theorem of hopf modules _ for ( co)quasi - hopf algebras @xcite , that extends the classical result for ordinary hopf algebras @xcite .",
    "a coquasibialgebra @xmath5 , although not associative in @xmath6 , is an associative algebra in the category @xmath7 of @xmath5-bicomodules and thus we can consider the category of left @xmath5-modules in @xmath7 .",
    "this is by definition the category of @xmath5-hopf modules .",
    "there is a monoidal functor from the category of right @xmath5-comodules to the category of @xmath5-hopf modules sending @xmath8 to the tensor product bicomodule @xmath9 , where @xmath8 is considered as trivial @xmath5-comodule on the left .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that when @xmath5 is a coquasi - hopf algebra this functor is an equivalence , and in a dual fashion , that a finite - dimensional quasibialgebra is quasi - hopf if and only if the module version of this functor is an equivalence .",
    "we prove that an analogous result holds if we replace coquasibialgebras by map pseudomonoids ( _ i.e. , _ pseudomonoids whose multiplication and unit have a right adjoint ) , hopf modules by the eilenberg - moore construction for certain monad and coquasi - hopf algebras by left autonomous map pseudomonoids .",
    "moreover , in our general setup no finiteness condition is necessary .",
    "we take this as an indication that the concept of dualization is more natural than the one of antipode .",
    "when the monoidal bicategory involved is right closed , and in particular when it is right autonomous , our hopf module construction can be internalised .",
    "naturally , this internalisation need not exist , being an eilenberg - moore construction for some monad on the endo - hom object @xmath10 $ ] of the map pseudomonoid @xmath0 .",
    "however , it does exist when the map pseudomonoid is left autonomous , and its object part is equivalent to @xmath0 .",
    "the centre of a monoidal category was defined in @xcite , and more recently generalised to the _ centre construction _ for pseudomonoids @xcite .",
    "a classical result reads that , for a hopf algebra @xmath5 , the category of two - sided hopf modules is monoidally equivalent to the centre of the category of @xmath5-(co)modules ; this has been extended to the case of quasi - hopf algebras in @xcite .",
    "both versions use the category of yetter - drinfeld modules as an intermediate stage in proving the equivalence .    in our general context , the lax centre of a left autonomous map pseudomonoid is the eilenberg - moore construction for a certain monad on the pseudomonoid , and if this is also right autonomous , then the lax centre is in fact the centre . in this way",
    "we reduce the problem of the existence of the lax centre of such pseudomonoids to the problem of the existence of a particular eilenberg - moore object .",
    "no analogue of the yetter - drinfeld modules appear in our construction . if we think of a hopf algebra as an autonomous pseudomonoid in the appropriate monoidal bicategory , its centre is equivalent to the _",
    "drinfeld double _ of the hopf algebra .",
    "this shows that the centre construction generalises the classical quantum double construction for hopf algebras .",
    "when we apply our results to the bicategory of @xmath4-modules , we are able to show that any left autonomous map pseudomonoid has a lax centre . in particular , any left autonomous monoidal @xmath4-category has a lax centre in @xmath11 .",
    "we shall describe the content of each section .    in section [ thmhopf.s ]",
    "we introduce the hopf modules for a map pseudomonoid @xmath0 in a monoidal bicategory @xmath12 as the eilenberg - moore construction for a certain monad in @xmath13 $ ] , and explain what we mean by the theorem of hopf modules .",
    "section [ opmon.s ] surveys some well - known facts about lax actions and opmonoidal morphisms .",
    "when the monad in the definition of hopf modules is representable by a monad @xmath14\\to [ a , a]$ ] in @xmath1 , we call an eilenberg - moore construction for it a _ hopf module construction _ for @xmath0 .",
    "this is introduced in section [ inthopf.s ] along with the proof that @xmath15 is a opmonoidal monad . a hopf module construction , of course",
    ", need not exist in general .",
    "in section [ existence.s ] we use completions under eilenberg - moore objects to study the existence of hopf module constructions . to that end , we extend these completions to a @xmath16-functor on @xmath16 , and then to a homomorphism of tricategories on @xmath3 .",
    "in section [ maintheorem.s ] we prove our main result : a map pseudomonoid @xmath0 is left autonomous if and only if the theorem of hopf modules holds for @xmath0 . also , we use the results of the preceding section to show that a map pseudomonoid is left autonomous if and only if it has a hopf module construction of a particular form , relating the problem of the existence of a dualization with a completeness problem .    in section [ s : frob ]",
    "we look at the relationship between autonomous and frobenius pseudomonoids .",
    "section [ centre.s ] deals with the relation between the hopf module construction and the lax centre construction .",
    "we show that for a left autonomous map pseudomonoid @xmath0 there exists a opmonoidal monad on @xmath0 for which an eilenberg - moore construction is exactly the lax centre of @xmath0 . moreover , if @xmath0 is also right autonomous then the lax centre coincides with the centre of @xmath0 , and one exists if and only if the other does .",
    "the last two sections are devoted to the applications .    in section [ vmod.sec ]",
    "we treat the example of the bicategory @xmath17 of @xmath4-modules , for a complete and cocomplete closed symmetric monoidal category @xmath4 . as shown in @xcite , a left autonomous pseudomonoid in @xmath17 whose multiplication , unit and dualization are representable by @xmath4-functors",
    "is exactly a left autonomous @xmath4-category in the usual sense that every object has a left dual .",
    "the bicategory @xmath17 has eilenberg - moore objects for monads and therefore any map pseudomonoid in it has a hopf module construction and any left autonomous map pseudomonoid has a lax centre , of which an explicit description is provided .",
    "we also exhibit for a promonoidal @xmath4-category @xmath18 , a canonical equivalence of @xmath4-categories @xmath19\\simeq z_\\ell([{\\ensuremath{\\mathscr{a}}},{\\ensuremath{\\mathscr{v}}}])$ ] ; here the lax centre on the left hand side is the one of @xmath18  as a pseudomonoid in @xmath17 , while on the right hand side we have the lax centre in @xmath20 .",
    "the example of the bicategory of comodules over a braided monoidal category is studied in the section [ comodules.sec ] . along with explicit descriptions of the general constructions of the previous sections ,",
    "we show how our work generalises results in @xcite on the theorem of hopf modules .",
    "for example , a coquasibialgebra @xmath21 has a dualization ( which in this case is a left @xmath22 and right @xmath21-bicomodule ) if and only if the theorem of hopf modules holds for @xmath21 .",
    "thus , admitting dualizations instead of mere antipodes @xmath23 , we are able to drop the finiteness conditions on c required in @xcite .",
    "we also show that the hopf module construction always exists for finite dimensional coquasibialgebras , and that our notion of the theorem of hopf modules , which implies the one of @xcite , is in fact equivalent to it when @xmath21 is finite dimensional . finally , by means of the results in section [ centre.s ]",
    ", we show that if @xmath21 is a finite coquasi - hopf algebra , then the centre of @xmath21 exists and is equivalent to the drinfeld double of @xmath21 .    while preparing a definitive version of this work the author recieved the preprint @xcite , where pastro and street study what they call doubles of monoidal enriched categories . they are lead to structures in the bicategory of @xmath4-modules very similar to some of the ones we describe in section [ vmod.sec ] .",
    "the author would like to thank martin hyland for his support throughout the preparation of this work and reading several versions of it .",
    "also thanks to ross street for useful correspondence and spotting some mistakes in a previous version .",
    "in this section we introduce the analogue for a map pseudomonoid of the category of hopf modules .",
    "we call _ maps _ the 1-cells in a bicategory with right adjoint .",
    "recall that a gray monoid @xcite is a monoid in the monoidal category @xmath16 . for a detailed treatment of the category",
    "@xmath16 see @xcite . as a category , @xmath16 is just the category of 2-categories and 2-functors .",
    "however , the monoidal structure we are interested in is not the one given by the cartesian product .    a _ cubical functor _ in two variables is a pseudofunctor between 2-categories @xmath24 with the following property : when we fix one of the variables we get a 2-functor , and for any 1-cell @xmath25 in @xmath26 the constraint @xmath27 is equal to the identity . for any pair of 2-categories @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,",
    "there is a 2-category @xmath30 equipped with a cubical functor @xmath31 inducing a bijection between cubical functors @xmath32 and 2-functors @xmath33 .",
    "this defines a monoidal structure on @xmath16 , which moreover is symmetric with the symmetry induced by the usual one for the cartesian product .",
    "a gray monoid is the same as a one - object @xmath16-category in the sense of enriched category theory , and therefore it can be thought of as a one - object tricategory , that is , a monoidal bicategory ( see @xcite ) . by the coherence theorem in @xcite ,",
    "any monoidal bicategory is monoidally biequivalent ( that is , triequivalent as a tricategory ) to a gray monoid .",
    "this allows us to develop the general theory by using gray monoids instead of general monoidal bicategories",
    ".    our main examples of monoidal bicategories will be the bicategory of comodules @xmath34 in a monoidal category @xmath4(see section [ comodules.sec ] ) and the bicategory of @xmath4-modules @xmath17 ( see section [ vmod.sec ] ) .",
    "let @xmath1  be a gray monoid and fix a map pseudomonoid @xmath35 in @xmath1 , that is , a pseudomonoid whose unit @xmath36 and multiplication @xmath37 are maps .",
    "recall from @xcite that a pseudomonoid , in addition to the unit and multiplication , is equipped with isomorphisms @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 satisfying three axioms which ensure , as shown in @xcite , that any 2-cell formed by pasting of tensor products of these isomorphisms , 1-cells and pseudonaturality constraints of the gray monoid is uniquely determined by its domain and codomain 1-cells .",
    "if @xmath41 is a map pseudomonoid , then @xmath42 is a _ pseudocomonoid _ , that is , a pseudomonoid in the opposite gray monoid . by definition",
    "the unit isomorphism @xmath43 of the pseudocomonoid @xmath42 is the mate of the constraint @xmath44 , and thus the following equality holds .",

    "one can define a pseudomonad on the 2-category @xmath46  as a pseudomonoid in the monoidal 2-category @xmath47 of pseudofunctors , pseudonatural transformations and modifications .",
    "a pseudocomonad is a pseudocomonoid in the same monoidal 2-category .",

    "<S> we study the existence of the internalisation of this notion , called the hopf module construction , by extending the completion under eilenberg - moore objects of a 2-category to a endo - homomorphism of tricategories on @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is the equivalence between the existence of a left dualization for @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath0 is left autonomous ) and the validity of an analogue of the structure theorem of hopf modules . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the hopf module construction for @xmath0 always exists .    </S>",
    "<S> we use these results to study the lax centre of a left autonomous map pseudomonoid . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the lax centre is the eilenberg - moore construction for a certain monad on @xmath0 ( one existing if the other does ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is also right autonomous , then the lax centre equals the centre . </S>",
    "<S> we look at the examples of the bicategories of @xmath4-modules and of comodules in @xmath4 , and obtain the drinfeld double of a coquasi - hopf algebra @xmath5 as the centre of @xmath5 . </S>"
