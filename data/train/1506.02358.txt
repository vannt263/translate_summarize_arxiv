    "massive stars with the mass @xmath8 on the zero age main sequence are supposed to explode as supernovae at the end of their lives @xcite .",
    "the explosion is actually instigated by implosion of the central core , which is later inverted and leads eventually to the ejection of outer envelopes and the formation of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes .",
    "exactly how that occurs is still a matter of fierce debates ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the stellar core just prior to collapse will be either consisted of irons ( referred to as the fe core in the following ) or composed of oxygen and neon mainly ( called the one core hereafter ) @xcite .",
    "the initial mass @xmath9 is the main factor to determine which is obtained in the end : stars on the lightest end of the spectrum of massive stars ( @xmath10 ) will have the one cores in the last stage of their lives whereas more massive stars will produce the fe cores @xcite .",
    "all the fe cores will eventually collapse gravitationally whereas only a fraction of the one cores will implode with the rest resulting in white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the masses that separate these different regimes are not well determined yet , since these stars commonly experience pulsational instabilities that are accompanied by mass ejections toward the end of their lives , which are very difficult to compute numerically @xcite .    in the quasi static evolutions of massive stars ,",
    "the carbon burning produces the one cores as an ash .",
    "if the star is massive enough ( @xmath11 , the central temperature becomes high enough to ignite these ash elements to produce si and eventually fe . in lighter stars , on the other hand , further burnings do not occur because the one core can be supported by degenerate electrons without any energy generation . the core acquires mass thereafter , however , through shell burnings while the outer envelopes shedding their masses through the pulsations and winds @xcite .",
    "if the final core mass , which is determined by these competing processes , is small and the central density does not reach the threshold @xmath12 , the result will be the formation of the one white dwarf as an end point of the evolution @xcite . in the opposite case ,",
    "i.e. , if the core becomes massive enough so that the central density could exceed the threshold of @xmath13 , then electron captures on mg would commence @xcite",
    ". once this happens , the core contracts further , accompanied by the rise of density and temperature .",
    "when the density reaches the critical values of @xmath14 , the electron captures on ne , one of the major elements , start and the implosion is much more accelerated , eventually leading to supernova explosions called the electron - capture supernovae ( ecsne ) .",
    "when the temperature reaches @xmath15 in the gravitational collapse , ne and o are ignited at the center , which is soon followed by si burnings , and the deflagration starts to propagate outward to convert the one core to the fe core .",
    "the latter is actually in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) with iron group elements being dominant .",
    "the conversion generates heat and the nse core becomes much hotter than the one core before the conversion .    in the case of more massive stars ,",
    "the temperatures are higher and electrons are not degenerate until the formation of the fe core .",
    "when the central temperature exceeds @xmath16 in the fe core , photo - dissociations of nuclei take place , which are actually a gradual change in the nuclear abundance in nse with lighter nuclei becoming more abundant . since this is an endothermic process , the accompanying pressure reduction triggers the collapse of fe core , which eventually leads to supernova explosions , to which we refer as the fe - core collapse supernovae or feccsne for short in this paper .",
    "these differences in the stellar evolutions to produce the one or fe core are reflected in the marked differences in the density profiles of the progenitors just prior to the core collapse : the one cores are in general less massive than the fe cores ; the density decreases very rapidly outside the core and the envelope is much more tenuous in the one cores . as a consequence ,",
    "the supernova dynamics itself may be different between them . as mentioned already",
    ", the mechanism of ccsne has been a long - standing unsolved problem for many decades .",
    "the initial implosion of the core is reversed by the outward sweep of the shock wave produced by the bounce that occurs for the inner part of the core when the central density exceeds the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the shock wave is not strong enough to get through the core completely and is stagnated inside the core .",
    "researchers are exploring the way to revive the stalled shock wave and for the moment the so - called neutrino heating scenario is supposed to be most promising @xcite . in this scenario , a fraction of neutrinos emitted copiously from a proto neutron star are re - absorbed by the matter below the shock wave and the resultant matter - heating reinvigorates the shock wave and produces explosion eventually .",
    "the mechanism is notoriously inefficient , however , and hydrodynamical instabilities of some sorts are believed to be necessary to boost the heating @xcite .",
    "although there is no consensus in the supernova society at present on whether the neutrino heating mechanism really works or not @xcite , we are rather certain that it can produce explosion successfully at least for the one core even without the boost by the hydrodynamical instabilities . as a matter of fact ,",
    "detailed numerical simulations demonstrated @xcite that shock revival occurs rather early thanks to the compact core and the tenuous envelope with the neutrino signals that lack the sign of the instabilities .",
    "the resultant explosion is believed to be weak with the energy being @xmath18 .",
    "this may not be a problem for ecsne , however , since sn1054 , which produced the crab pulsar , is supposed to be such an event @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are crucial not only in the mechanism of ccsne but also in observations as vindicated in sn1987a @xcite .",
    "indeed ccsne are one of the most important targets of the nascent neutrino astrophysics @xcite .",
    "it is true that the pns cooling phase following the shock revival makes the greatest contributions to neutrino emissions . as a matter of fact",
    ", this phase lasts for @xmath19 and radiates as neutrinos most of the energy of @xmath20 that are liberated by the gravitational collapse and stored as the internal energy in the proto neutron star ( pns ) @xcite . however , neutrino emissions commence much earlier on .",
    "it is well known in stellar evolution theory that neutrino emissions dominate photon radiations in the stellar cooling after c burning .",
    "there are five processes responsible for the neutrino emissions : 1 .",
    "annihilations of electron - positron pairs , 2 .",
    "plasmon decays , 3 .",
    "photo - pair processes , 4 . bremsstrahlungs by electrons and positrons accelerated by nuclei and 5 .",
    "electron captures on nuclei and free nucleons .",
    "which process is dominant depends on the density and temperature of matter in general @xcite but the first two processes are normally the most important in the late phase of the massive star evolution . in particular , the pair annihilation is dominant at high temperatures whereas the plasmon decay becomes more important at lower temperatures .",
    "what is important here is that the neutrinos emitted by these processes prior to collapse may be observable if the supernova occurs in our vicinity , e.g. , within 1kpc .",
    "@xcite calculated the luminosities and spectra of the neutrinos emitted by the pair annihilations during the c- , ne- , o- , si - burnings for a 20 @xmath21 progenitor model with the monte carlo method and estimated the detection events for 6 terrestrial neutrino detectors .",
    "they found that the mean energies of neutrinos are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 for the c- , ne- , o- and si - burnings , respectively . assuming that the distance to the supernova is @xmath26",
    ", they evaluated the event numbers would be 41 for super - kamiokande and 4 for kamland .    in this paper , we investigate the possibility to distinguish the ecsn from feccsn by the observation of the pre - collapse neutrinos . employing a latest realistic progenitor model with an one core @xcite as well as those with fe cores ( private communications with takahashi ) ,",
    "we calculate the temporal evolutions of the luminosities and spectra of the neutrinos emitted via the pair annihilations and plasmon decays , the two main emission reactions .",
    "we also evaluate roughly the expected numbers of detection events both for water cherenkov detectors and for liquid scintillators , taking neutrino oscillations into account . as the representative detectors of these two types in current operation , we choose super - kamiokande and kamland . although the latter detectors have much smaller fiducial volumes than the former , they have better sensitivities at low energies .",
    "note that the average neutrino energies predecited by @xcite are lower than the typical energy thresholds @xmath27 for these large water cherenkov detectors .",
    "in addition to these detectors , we also consider hyper - kamiokande , a planned next - generation water cherenkov detector , and juno , a larger - scale liquid scintillator under construction .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the progenitor models for ecsn and feccsn are described in section 2 ; our method to calculate the luminosities and spectra of the neutrinos emitted by the pair annihilation and plasmon decay is summarized in section 3 and detailed in appendix ; the results are presented in section 4 , and finally the summary and discussions are given in section 5 .",
    "we employed realistic progenitor models with 8.4 , model in their original paper by @xcite . after taking into account convective overshooting in their stellar evolution calculation",
    ", they found that the smaller stellar mass produced essentially the same one core at the end of the evolution .",
    "we have hence decided to adopt this updated number in this paper . ]",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 calculated by takahashi et al . @xcite .",
    "the first one produces the one core that will give rise to the ecsn whereas the last two generate fe cores , which will result in the feccsne .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath30 model is not very different from those of the other two until the c - burning .",
    "once a core composed of oxygen and neon is formed , they evolve differently . in the lightest model",
    ", the central temperature does not reach the value needed to ignite ne , decreasing initially owing to thermally activated neutrino emissions .",
    "the one core contracts on the kelvin - helmholtz time scale as a result .",
    "the shell he - burning increases the mass of the core , which is now supported by degenerate electrons .",
    "as the core becomes fatter , the central density and , as a consequence , the chemical potential of electrons also rise there .",
    "the @xmath30 model is massive enough to exceed the density threshold @xmath31 for the electron capture on @xmath32 .",
    "the electron capture enhances the contraction of the one core .",
    "since the electron captures are exothermic , the temperature increases rather rapidly in this phase .",
    "when the central density reaches @xmath33 , @xmath34 starts to capture electrons , further accelerating the core contraction . when the central temperature reaches @xmath15 , the o+ne burning takes place .",
    "then the temperature rises quickly and the nuclear statistical equilibrium , or nse , is established at @xmath35 .",
    "the nse region expands at @xmath36 as the burning of o+ne propagates outward as a deflagration .",
    "electron captures on iron group elements as well as on free protons occur in the nse region just as in the fe core of feccsne and finally lead to a rapid collapse of the core .    in the case of more massive progenitors of @xmath28 and @xmath29 ,",
    "the one cores achieve high enough temperatures to ignite ne and subsequently o and si stably with electrons being non - degenerate , to produce fe cores finally .",
    "the masses of these cores grow in time as the si burning continues and the gravitational collapse is induced normally by photo - dissociations of heavy nuclei at @xmath37 .",
    "it is a rule of thumb that the more massive the progenitor is , the higher temperature they have for a given density .",
    "this is particularly so , however , when comparing @xmath28 and @xmath29 models with the @xmath30 model . in the latter model ,",
    "the core is much cooler until the o+ne deflagration produces nse , the fact which has consequences in the neutrino emissions in the pre - supernova stages as shown later .",
    "the neutrino emissions in the pre - supernova stages from massive stars that produce fe cores were studied by some authors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the neutrino emissions from the one cores that will yield ecsne later .",
    "we employed the @xmath28 and @xmath29 models mainly for comparison to elucidate qualitative differences that the one cores may make .",
    "figures  [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] present the evolutions of these three progenitor models in different ways .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] is the hr diagram , in which the temporal changes in the luminosities @xmath38 and effective temperatures @xmath39 are shown as trajectories .",
    "it is found that the more massive the star is , the more luminous it is but , otherwise , the evolutions are similar to each other . the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the temporal changes in the central densities and temperatures as trajectories in the @xmath40 diagram .",
    "it is evident that three evolutionary paths are not very different from each other initially up to @xmath41 .",
    "as mentioned above , the @xmath30 star gets cooled via neutrino emissions efficiently after c - burning and the central temperature becomes much lower than those in other two models , for which the central temperatures increase continuously up to the onset of collapse . in the lightest model ,",
    "the temperature rises rapidly at @xmath42 , at which the electron captures first on mg and then on ne enhance the core contraction and the o+ne burning commences at some point , producing the nse core and heating up the matter in it .",
    "after nse is established , the central temperature becomes comparable to or a bit higher than those in the fe cores of @xmath28 and @xmath29 models .",
    "the electron captures on heavy elements accelerate the gravitational collapse that leads to core bounce in the @xmath30 model whereas the photo - dissociations of iron groups elements trigger the collapse in the other two models .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the changes in various quantities at the center as functions of time .",
    "note that the horizontal axis is the time to collapse . since it is not easy to define the times of the onset of collapse unambiguously , we choose them simply as the final times in the stellar evolution models , at which @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the @xmath45 model whereas @xmath46 and @xmath44 for the @xmath47 model and @xmath48 and @xmath49 for the @xmath50 model .",
    "it is clear again that the @xmath30 model is different from the other two qualitatively .",
    "this is most manifest in the third panel , in which the degeneracy of electrons @xmath51 is shown .",
    "reflecting the fact that the core is much cooler in this model , electrons are strongly degenerate after c - burning .",
    "we will find later that this feature will cause qualitative differences in the neutrino emissions from these progenitors .",
    "it is incidentally pointed out that the electron fraction @xmath52 drops rather rapidly in the @xmath30 model once the nse core is formed by the o+ne deflagration and electron captures on heavy elements take place .",
    "figures  [ fig4 ] , [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] give the radial profiles of density , temperature , electron degeneracy and electron fraction at five different epochs for the three progenitor models , respectively . in the left panels",
    "these variables are plotted against radius whereas the mass coordinate is used in the right panels .",
    "the qualitative differences between the @xmath30 model and the other two are evident .",
    "in fact , we can identify the propagation of the deflagration wave , which sweeps through the one core from the center , producing the hot nse core behind .",
    "it is also recognized that the electron fraction drops only in the nse region .",
    "figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] show , on the other hand , that the electron capture proceeds in the entire fe cores . in the next section",
    "we formulate the neutrino emissivities for the electron - positron annihilation and plasmon decay and evaluate them for the profiles given here .",
    "of the five neutrino - emission processes that are supposed to occur in massive stars , i.e. electron - positron pair annihilation , plasmon decay , photo - pair process , bremsstrahlung and electron capture , the first two are more important than the others in general .",
    "having in mind the applications to stellar evolution calculations , @xcite obtained useful fitting formulae to the energy loss rates for these processes .",
    "they also drew a phase diagram in the @xmath40 plane to indicate which reaction is dominant for a given combination of density and temperature . according to their results and the evolutionary paths of our models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the electron pair annihilation will be dominant for the @xmath28 and @xmath29 models , which form fe cores and will hence produce the feccsne whereas the plasmon decay will be the most important neutrino - emission process for the @xmath30 model , which will result in the ecsn .",
    "we will see in the next section that this is indeed the case . in order to evaluate the numbers of detection events for the terrestrial neutrino detectors , not only the energy loss rate but also the spectra are needed . in the following ,",
    "we describe the formulae that we employed in this work to numerically evaluate the luminosities and spectra of neutrinos for the electron - positron pair annihilation and plasmon decay .",
    "when the temperature in the core becomes @xmath53 , the number of photons with high enough energy to produce electron - positron pairs becomes large .",
    "as the temperature increases , these pairs become highly abundant , being in chemical equilibrium with photons .",
    "although they annihilate each other to generate photons most of the time , they produce from time to time pairs of neutrino and anti - neutrino via weak interaction . @xmath54",
    "the feynman diagram corresponding to this process is displayed in fig .",

    "we evaluate them at different times so that their time evolutions could be obtained .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the number luminosities of different neutrino species for the three progenitor models as functions of the time to collapse .",
    "the contributions from the pair annihilation and the plasmon decay and their sum are plotted separately for the @xmath30 model whereas only those from the pair annihilation are shown for the other two progenitors .",
    "the left panel displays the results for the electron - type neutrinos and those for the other types are presented in the right panel .",
    "since there is no heavy charged lepton in the progenitor cores , there is no difference between the mu - type and tau - type neutrinos . to the production of electron - type neutrinos , on the other hand , not only the neutral current but the charged current also contribute .",
    "the number luminosities of electron - type neutrinos are hence larger by an order of magnitude than others in general .",
    "this is particularly true of the plasmon decay in the @xmath30 model .",
    "in fact , the number luminosity by the plasmon decay is larger than by the pair annihilation for the electron - type neutrinos whereas the former is much smaller than the latter for the mu- and tau - type neutrinos .",
    "the difference between the neutrino flavors , although not so drastic , are also recognized for the pair annihilation .",
    "much more remarkable in the figure is qualitative differences between the one core and the fe cores . among other things ,",
    "the fe cores emit a substantial amount of neutrinos from much earlier on than the one core .",
    "this is simply due to their higher temperatures as mentioned earlier .",
    "the electron - positron pairs are more abundant , producing neutrinos copiously . in fact , the one core is so cold until the electron capture on mg is opened that electrons are strongly degenerate and , as a consequence , positrons are scarce , making the neutrino luminosity from the pair annihilation negligibly small .",
    "unfortunately , the plasmon contribution is also tiny as long as the temperature is very low , since only a small amount of plasmons are thermally populated then .",
    "it is hence understandable that the neutrino luminosity becomes substantial in the one core only after the electron captures and the subsequent burnings of oxygen and silicon heat it up , which occur less than a second before collapse . even after the formation of the nse region ( @xmath142 ) inside the core ,",
    "the number luminosity of the one core is much smaller than those of the fe cores . as a matter of fact",
    ", @xmath143 neutrinos are emitted in the @xmath50 model while in the @xmath45 model the number of emitted neutrinos is only @xmath144 .",
    "note , however , that the luminosity increases very quickly in the last few hundred milliseconds in the one core and it is still increasing rapidly at the end of our calculation . at this point the central density is @xmath145 and no more data are available from the stellar evolution calculation .",
    "unlike the fe cores , the one core is rather slowly contracting even at this point , with the nse region being expanding gradually .",
    "we hence expect the luminosity continues to rise further until neutrinos are trapped inside the core , which will be somewhat delayed , since the neutrinos considered here have smaller energies ( @xmath146 ) than those produced by electron captures during collapse ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "we show the corresponding energy luminosity evolutions in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . unlike the number luminosity",
    ", the energy luminosity of anti - neutrinos is different from that of their partner neutrinos for the electron - positron pair annihilation .",
    "they are hence displayed separately in the figure . in the case of the plasmon decay , however , the vector current contribution is dominant over other contributions and we ignore the latter completely in this paper .",
    "in that approximation , there is no distinction between the energy luminosity of neutrinos and that of the partner anti - neutrinos .",
    "it is apparent that the essential features are nearly the same as those in the number luminosities .",
    "the energy luminosities for the fe cores are much larger than those for the one core through the entire evolutions up to collapse . although the luminosities are different between the neutrinos and anti - neutrinos in the same flavor , differences are indiscernible in the figure .",
    "one thing to note here is that the energy luminosity of @xmath148 from the plasmon decay is smaller than the that from the pair annihilation , the opposite trend to what we found in the number luminosity ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ) .",
    "this happens because the average energies of neutrinos are quite different between the two emitting processes , which will be demonstrated shortly .",
    "incidentally , both the number and energy luminosities are larger for the @xmath29 model than for the @xmath149 model .",
    "this is simply because the temperatures are a bit higher for the former than for the latter according to the general rule that the more massive the star is , the hotter it is .",
    "figure  [ fig11 ] shows the normalized number spectra of different neutrino species , which are evaluated for the pair annihilation and plasmon decay individually at different times for each of the three progenitor models .",
    "note that upper panels correspond to earlier epochs in this figure .",
    "the results for the @xmath45 model are plotted in the left panels and are limited to the last @xmath150 , since the luminosities are too small at earlier times as seen above .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the peak neutrino energy for the plasmon decay is @xmath151 and is not much changed in this phase .",
    "these values are substantially lower than those for the pair annihilation .",
    "in fact , the neutrinos produced by the pair annihilation have @xmath152 on average .",
    "this is exactly the reason why the number luminosity of electron - type neutrinos from the plasmon decay is larger than that from the pair annihilation whereas the corresponding energy luminosities have the opposite order .",
    "it is also evident that the spectra for the pair annihilation are much broader than those for the plasmon decay and , as a consequence , a greater number of high energy neutrinos are emitted in the pair annihilation , the fact that makes this process more important from the observational point of view , since the cross section of the inverse @xmath72 decay process that is employed for detection by the terrestrial detectors is approximately proportional to the square of neutrino energy .",
    "we can also recognize that neutrinos have higher peak energies than anti - neutrinos of the same flavor .",
    "the difference is largest for the electron - type neutrino .",
    "the origin of these differences is the disparity between electrons and positrons in the cores , with the former being more abundant .    the middle and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] show the normalized number spectra for the @xmath149 and @xmath29 models , respectively . in these plots",
    "the plasmon decay is ignored and only those from the pair annihilation are displayed .",
    "note that the time spans are quite different in these plots from that for the @xmath30 model .",
    "this is because the fe cores emit neutrinos longer as mentioned earlier .",
    "what is most remarkable here is the fact that the peak energies for these fe cores are much lower than those of the one core . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the peak energies ( @xmath153 ) for the former is even smaller than the threshold energy @xmath154 for the inverse @xmath72 decay .",
    "the difference stems from the fact that electrons are more degenerate and have larger chemical potentials in the one core ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . for the same reason ,",
    "the difference between the neutrinos and anti - neutrinos of the same flavor is much less pronounced in the fe cores although the trend is the same .",
    "we will investigate what consequences the features we have seen in this subsection may have on the detectability of the neutrinos emitted from the different progenitors in the next subsection .",
    "based on the results obtained so far , we roughly evaluate the expected number of neutrinos that will be detected in the terrestrial detectors such as super - kamiokande and kamland . both the water cherenkov and liquid scintillation detectors will observe the inverse-@xmath72 decay reaction @xmath155 which is induced by the pre - supernova neutrinos when they hit the targets in the detectors .",
    "following @xcite , we express the cross section @xmath156 of this interaction as @xmath157,\\ ] ] in which the emitted positron energy and 3-momentum are denoted by @xmath158 and @xmath159 , respectively , with @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 being the neutron , proton and electron rest masses , respectively ; the vector and axial - vector form factors are assumed to be @xmath163 , @xmath164 and the constant @xmath165 is given as @xmath166 with the radiative correction @xmath167 and the cabbibo angle @xmath168 .",
    "then the event rate at a detector , @xmath169 , is expressed as @xmath170 in which @xmath171 and @xmath55 denote the target number in the detector and the distance between the star and the detector , respectively . for simplicity , we assume that the detection efficiency is @xmath172 above the threshold @xmath173 .",
    "the features we assume in this paper are summarized in table  [ detector ] for super - kamiokande , kamland , hyper - kamiokande and juno . for the latter two",
    ", the actual numbers will be different from those listed in the table .",
    "since it is not our intention here to give very accurate estimates on the event numbers , we believe that they are good enough .",
    "the cumulative event number @xmath174 is obtained by the integration over the time : @xmath175    in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ eq : eq42 ] ) , the number spectrum should be modified with an appropriate account of neutrino oscillations .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] the mixing lengths and the density scale heights along with the density profiles for the three progenitor models .",
    "we assume here that the neutrino energy is @xmath176 and that the mass hierarchy is inverted .",
    "since the envelope of the @xmath30 is much more tenuous than those for the other two models and the density gradient is much steeper accordingly , the ratio of the scale height to the mixing length becomes smallest for the one core model at the resonance , which is marked with a star in the figure , just as expected .",
    "it is evident , however , that the scale height is still larger than the mixing length by a order of magnitude even in that case .",
    "we hence assume adiabatic oscillations in the following .",
    "this is certainly justified for the normal hierarchy , since there is no resonance in the anti - neutrino sector .",
    "it is noted , however , that the mass and structure of the outer envelope of the 8.4@xmath177 model are highly uncertain just prior to collapse . since the envelope was ignored in the evolution calculation after the completion of c burning , we attach it again to the core model , assuming that it is hydrostatic and its temperature and chemical composition profiles are unchanged from those at the end of c burning .",
    "the number spectrum of the electron - type anti - neutrino is then given as follows : @xmath178 in this expression , the subscript @xmath179 means the original spectra before the neutrino oscillations are taken into account ; @xmath180 stands for @xmath181 or @xmath182 , both of which we assume to have the same spectra ; the so - called survival probability @xmath183 is given in the adiabatic limit as @xmath184 with @xmath185 , @xmath186 for normal hierarchy and @xmath187 for inverted hierarchy @xcite . in the above expression , the @xmath188 and @xmath189 are the elements of the unitary matrix @xmath190 transforming the mass eigen states to the flavor eigenstates as @xmath191 it is normally parametrized by three mixing angles , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 and a cp - violating phase , @xmath195 , as @xmath196 with the common shorthand notations of @xmath197 and @xmath198 for @xmath199 .",

    ", more than 1 neutrinos will be detected a day before collapse both at super - kamiokande and kamland , which seems to be consistent with the preceding paper @xcite .",
    "the total event numbers are also comparable between the two detectors although the detector volumes are vastly different .",
    "this is mainly due to the sensitivity of kamland to low energy neutrinos ( see table  1 for the energy threshold of each detector ) .    in the case of the one core model , on the other hand ,",
    "the expected event numbers are much smaller than those for the fe core models .",
    "this is so in spite of the fact that the peak energy of @xmath0 is about twice larger for the one core than for the fe cores after the formation of nse core in the former .",
    "it turns out that the duration of such neutrinos is simply too short in the one core . since the volume of the nse core is small accordingly , the luminosity itself is smaller for the one core .",
    "both the water cherenkov detector and liquid scintillation detector may see a major scale - up in the near future . for example , hyper - kamiokande is a planned next - generation water cherenkov detector with volume expected to be @xmath201 times larger than that of super - kamiokande .",
    "juno , on the other hand , is a liquid scintillation detector with the size @xmath202 times as great as that of kamland ans is currently under construction .",

    "the cumulative event numbers are shown in fig.[fig16 ] as functions of time .",
    "the distance to the source is again assumed to be @xmath203 .",
    "it is found that for the @xmath29 model with an fe core , the total event number reaches @xmath204 for juno , which means that we may observe @xmath205 events even if the source is located at @xmath26 .",
    "hyper - kamiokande , on the other hand , will observe @xmath206 events , which is not much different from those for super - kamiokande .",
    "this is because of the somewhat high energy threshold of @xmath207 we employ here .",
    "if this were as small as the one for super - kamiokande , the event number would be larger by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "the disadvantage of the high energy threshold is also vindicated in the expected event numbers for the @xmath149 model .",
    "since the peak energy of neutrino is somewhat lower in this model , the event numbers at hyper - kamiokande is even smaller than those at super - kamiokande . in the case of the @xmath45 model with an one core",
    ", the event numbers are expected to be much smaller than unity even for these large scale detectors and the distance as small as @xmath203 .",
    "we are hence forced to conclude that it is highly difficult to observe the pre - supernova neutrinos from one cores .",
    "put another way , no detection of such neutrinos from a nearby ccsn in the future may indicate that it is an ecsn .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the pre - supernova neutrino emissions from the one - core forming progenitor and compared them with those from the more massive fe - core producing progenitors , aiming to distinguish ecsne form more common feccsne by future observations of a near by supernova . employing the realistic progenitor models , we have calculated the temporal evolutions of the luminosities and spectra of the neutrinos emitted by these stars via the electron - positron pair annihilations and plasmon decays .",
    "based on these results , we have then roughly evaluated the numbers of detection events for super - kamiokande and kamland as the representative water cherenkov and liquid scintillation detectors , respectively , in current operation .",
    "we have also considered hyper - kamiokande and juno , which may be operational in the near future .",
    "we have found that the electron - positron pair annihilation dominates over other neutrino - emission processes in the fe - core producing models whereas in the one - core generating model the plasmon decay is dominant until the nse core is formed at the center , after which the pair annihilation prevails quickly and the neutrino luminosity rises rapidly . since the contraction proceeds slowly in the latter case ,",
    "the central density is larger just prior to collapse and , as a result , emitted neutrinos have larger peak energies than in the fe cores , which is advantageous from the observational point of view .",
    "it is also found that the neutrinos emitted via the plasmon decay have much smaller energies ( @xmath151 ) and will be undetected on the terrestrial detectors that employ the inverse decay reaction with the energy threshold of @xmath208",
    ".    based on these results we have roughly estimated the number of detection events for super - kamiokande and kamland .",
    "we have seen that both will detect tens of neutrinos from the feccsne if they are located at @xmath203 from the earth whereas neither will be able to detect the ecsne even at this small distance .",
    "if we envisage next - generation detectors such as juno , these numbers may be increased by an order of magnitude . on the other hand",
    ", hyper - kamiokande may not be advantageous for the detection of such low energy neutrinos unless the energy threshold is as low as that of super - kamiokande .",
    "it should be pointed out that the neutrino emissions will continue after the gravitational collapse of the core commences . as mentioned earlier , the core contraction is slow in the @xmath30 model even when the central density reaches @xmath145 and it may take another few hundreds msec until core bounce . since the neutrino luminosity is till rising rapidly even at the end of calculation .",
    "it is hence expected that the actual event numbers will be increased substantially .",
    "some delay of the neutrino trapping , which will actually terminate the neutrino emissions , owing to the lower neutrino energy will be also advantageous in this respect .",
    "it is hence important to calculate the neutrino light curve up to core bounce , after which ordinary supernova neutrinos will prevail .",
    "although we have not considered the plasmon decay for the fe cores in this paper , it may be comparable to or even dominant over the pair annihilation in the late phase according to the right panel of fig .",
    "we hence compare the total emissivities of these two processes just prior to core - collapse for the @xmath50 model in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] . in the central region",
    "@xmath209 , the plasmon process emits more energy indeed . in the outer part of the core",
    ", however , the pair annihilation becomes dominant and emit far greater amounts of energy in neutrinos .",
    "this is due to the strong dependence of the pair annihilation on the temperature ( see the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "note also that the plasmon decay is suppressed at lower densities ( see the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) . integrating these emissivities over the radius , we find that the total emitted energy from the plasmon process is @xmath210 , which is much smaller than that from the pair annihilation ( @xmath211 ) and justifies our neglect of the plasmon decay in the fe - core progenitor models .",
    "so far we have seen that the pre - supernova neutrino emission is qualitatively different between the one and fe cores , which fact is reflected in the expected event numbers on the terrestrial detectors .",
    "actual detectability is crucially dependent on the background noises at detectors , however .",
    "although it is much beyond the scope of this paper to take them into account in detail for each detector and discuss the detection possibility quantitatively , we can touch the issue briefly : if we adopt several hundreds@xmath212 as a typical background for super - kamiokande , neutrinos from feccsne may be detected at @xmath213 if the source is located at @xmath203 .",
    "the background will be reduced substantially if the neutron tagging is enhanced with gd @xcite .",

    "the neutrinos from fe cores may be detected to @xmath215 .",

    ", however , the reduction of the energy threshold will be more crucial as mentioned above . in this paper , we have considered only two relatively light fe - core progenitors .",
    "it is certainly important , though , to study more systematically pre - supernova neutrinos from different progenitors .",
    "it should be also stressed that the expected event numbers for these models may change by a factor of a few if one considers various uncertainties in the stellar evolution calculation .",

    "<S> aiming to distinguish two types of progenitors of core collapse supernovae , i.e. , one with a core composed mainly of oxygen and neon ( abbreviated as one core ) and the other with an iron core ( or fe core ) , we calculated the luminosities and spectra of neutrinos emitted from these cores prior to gravitational collapse , taking neutrino oscillation into account . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the total energies emitted as @xmath0 from the one core are @xmath1 , which is much smaller than @xmath2 for fe cores . </S>",
    "<S> the average energy , on the other hand , is twice as large for the one core as those for the fe cores . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrinos produced by the plasmon decays in the one core are more numerous than those from the electron - positron annihilation in both cores but they have much lower average energies @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> although it is difficult to detect the pre - supernova neutrinos from the one core even if it is located within 200@xmath4pc from the earth , we expect @xmath5 and @xmath6 events for fe cores at kamland and super - kamiokande , respectively , depending on the progenitor mass and neutrino - mass hierarchy . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers might be increased by an order of magnitude if we envisage next - generation detectors such as juno . </S>",
    "<S> we will hence be able to distinguish the two types of progenitors by the detection or non - detection of the pre - supernova neutrinos if they are close enough ( @xmath7 ) . </S>"
