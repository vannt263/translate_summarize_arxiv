    "measurements of peculiar velocities provide direct probes of the mass distribution in the universe putting constraints on models of large - scale structure formation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "advances on new distance indicators ( @xcite ; @xcite ) have allowed estimates of peculiar flows in the local universe up to @xmath8mpc ( see @xcite , or @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the results from using elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) suggest a large coherence length and amplitude of the local peculiar velocity field .",
    "the results from analysis of 1,355 spirals using the tully - fisher relation to determine distances ( @xcite ) would lead to an even larger coherence length and a similar amplitude .",
    "other samples are also in agreement with the great attractor findings ( @xcite ) . in a more controversial finding @xcite find from analysis of clusters of galaxies that the peculiar flows can be coherent over a much larger scale than the great attractor findings .",
    "all the results indicate significant deviations from the hubble flow with a large coherence length .    since peculiar velocities probe the mass distribution and also depend on the density parameter @xmath2 one can determine the latter by comparing the mass distribution implied by the velocity field with the observed distribution of galaxies .",
    "the density parameter is thus determined to within the uncertainty of the bias factor @xmath9 by determining the factor @xmath10 .",
    "other analysis of the peculiar velocity information may be applied in order to obtain the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite developed the potent method whereby the mass distribution is reconstructed by using the analog of the bernoulli equation for irrotational flows .",
    "they used the method to analyze to great detail the peculiar velocity field out to about 60@xmath11mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite compared the previously determined velocity field with the observed distribution of galaxies and concluded that the best fit is with @xmath12 .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the components of the velocity tensor @xmath13 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite has analyzed this tensor for the markiii peculiar velocity data to reconstruct the large - scale power spectrum obtaining consistency within the cdm model with @xmath14 . in a similar study",
    "@xcite obtain a different result @xmath15 indicating the need of further analysis .",
    "in this paper we study the peculiar velocity field through a statistical analysis of cobe normalized cdm numerical simulations and observational data taken from the mark iii catalog .",
    "our comparison of models and observations take into account observational uncertainties and possible biases , and variations of the results according to different observers in fully non - linear numerical simulations .",
    "we use the mark iii catalog ( @xcite;@xcite;@xcite ) as a suitable data set to analyze the peculiar velocity flow .",
    "this catalog lists tully - fisher and @xmath16 distances and radial velocities for spiral , irregular , and elliptical galaxies . in our analysis",

    "our statistics are based on a direct comparison between the observations and mock catalogs derived from the numerical simulations .",
    "the cobe normalized cdm models studied require no strong bias , so we have adopted @xmath50 in the simulations .",
    "this assumption is not crucial in the results of our studies since we have analyzed mock catalogs with different bias parameters @xmath51 finding no significant differences in the statistical results presented in this work .    also , we have studied the effects produced by different limiting radial distances in our comparison of models and observations by setting two different catalog depth limits @xmath52 , and @xmath53 @xmath54 ( 1764 and 2854 galaxies respectively ) .",
    "we have considered an analysis of bulk motions as measured by the distribution of peculiar velocities of neighbor galaxies using mean values , dispersions and kurtosis ( as a suitable parameter to measure departures from gaussianity ) to describe the velocity distribution .",
    "we define shells of radius @xmath55 @xmath54 and width @xmath56 @xmath57 centered in each of the galaxies of the sample and we compute the difference between each galaxy radial velocity in the shell ( @xmath58 ) and the mean motion of the galaxies in a sphere of radius @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we compute the dispersion and kurtosis ( d , k respectively ) of these relative velocities across the shells as a function of @xmath61 .",

    "we have computed the ratio ( m ) of the mean of this distribution to the dispersion d described in the preceding paragraph .",
    "the parameter m provides a useful information on the coherence of the velocity flow by measuring the mean systematic to random motion ratio of shells of radius @xmath61 ( note that m differs from the definition of the cosmic mach number given by @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath64    we have also provided a different statistical characterization of the peculiar velocity field through an analysis of the distribution of relative radial velocities of pairs of galaxies ( @xmath58 and @xmath65 ) as a function of separation ( for simplicity we use the same variable @xmath61 as the shell radii of the previously defined statistics @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "we have computed the corresponding dispersion ( d1 ) and kurtosis ( k1 ) and we calculate the average modulus of the pair peculiar velocity difference ( @xmath68 ) . a measurement of the pairwise coherence of the flow is also provided by estimating the average of the product of radial peculiar velocities of pairs of galaxies with separation @xmath61 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "@xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    the d1 parameter corresponds to the mean pairwise velocity dispersion usually estimated from the distortion of the correlation function in redshift - space .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the d1 results obtained from the peculiar velocity data would not be directly comparable with the correlation function distortion findings .",
    "this is mainly due to the presence of biases and uncertainties in the peculiar velocity data and the different hypotheses adopted in the redshift - space correlation analysis ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "we have considered 100 random observers in each numerical simulation by defining cones with different positions and orientations in our computational volume .",
    "also , given the presence of a strong radial gradient in the data we have attempted to study its possible effects on the determinations of velocity statistics . the observed radial gradient corresponds approximately to a selection bias due to a magnitude limit cutoff .",
    "this can be seen from the observed distribution of absolute magnitudes which is nearly gaussian with mean @xmath74 ( the knee of the luminosity function ) and @xmath75 .",
    "nevertheless , for our statistical purposes it is not necessary to adopt a monte - carlo model using the galaxy luminosity function in the simulations .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of strong dependence of observed galaxy luminosities with environment .",
    "therefore , it suffices to reproduce the observed radial gradient in the numerical models through a monte - carlo rejection algorithm .",
    "accordingly , we use this procedure to reproduce in the mock catalogs derived from the numerical simulations , the observed galaxy radial gradient .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the resulting number of particles of the mock catalogs to be of the order of the number of galaxies in the observational sample .",
    "we find that the radial gradient is very important since it significantly changes the results of the statistics when errors are included .    in order to quantify the effects of observational errors in galaxy distance estimates we have considered gaussian errors in the galaxy absolute magnitudes of the tf relation with dispersion @xmath76 @xmath5 corresponding to relative errors in distances @xmath77",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "namely , we assign to each particle in the mock catalog a new distance @xmath78 where @xmath79 is taken from a gaussian distribution with dispersion corresponding to the tf uncertainty . then , as the particle peculiar velocities are inferred from the galaxy redshift and distance , @xmath80 .",
    "we have also explored the effects produced by a possible tf zero - point offset ( either positive or negative ) in the statistical results . in our analysis we have considered absolute magnitude offsets @xmath81 corresponding to twice the @xmath82 uncertainty derived in @xcite , and have been adopted to test their effects on the statistics .",
    "the mean galaxy peculiar velocities are enhanced due to the scatter of the tf relation by a factor approximately proportional to their distances .",
    "since our statistics deal with small angular separations between the galaxies , the tf scatter will mostly affect the results involving relative radial peculiar velocities . on the other hand",
    ", the coherence of the flow would be significantly enhanced by an offset in the tf zero - point ( either positive or negative ) due to the systematic motion of the galaxies added to the true velocity field .",
    "we have also considered the effects of a fraction of spuriously high peculiar velocities in the mark iii catalog . to constraint the number of these systematically large velocities in the data we have added to the peculiar velocities of a given fraction of particles of the mock catalogs a velocity taken from an even probability distribution @xmath83 within @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and zero elsewhere ( @xmath86 is the dispersion of the observed distribution of peculiar velocities ) .",
    "the kurtosis parameter involves the 4-th power of the difference between the observed value of a given quantity and the mean of its distribution ( see eq .",
    "[ k ] or eq .",

    "it can be seen in this figure the lack of importance of the tf scatter and zero point offset ( @xmath92 @xmath5 and @xmath93 @xmath5 respectively ) in contrast to the strong effect of spurious large velocities . a modest fraction ( @xmath94 ) of such velocities",

    "both affect significantly the coherence of the velocities ; tf zero - point offsets rise @xmath69 in a factor proportional to @xmath61 ; while the scatter reduces the coherence at large separations @xmath61 and increases it at small @xmath61 .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with those derived from the velocity correlation function ( see for instance @xcite ) where a coherence length of @xmath104 @xmath54 is observed for the aaronson sample of the markiii catalog . from our analysis we find a larger value of the coherence length @xmath105 @xmath54 .",
    "however we note that this spatial scale defined by a lack of velocity correlation depends on the catalog depth , and very strongly on tf scatter since at distances @xmath106 @xmath54 , the associated uncertainties in the peculiar velocities are of comparable magnitude to the flow coherence .",

    "moreover , the changes in the statistics from one catalog depth to the other in the observations and in the mock catalogs are similar indicating that the conclusions derived are not depth dependent .",
    "however , the dispersion arising from different observer positions is considerably larger in the @xmath117 @xmath54 case which suggests the use of the deeper sample .",

    "we find that the observed scatter of the tf relation plays a very important role when deriving constraints to the cosmological parameters . if errors in galaxy distance estimates are neglected , the observed magnitude of the @xmath68 results show consistency with high density cdm models ( @xmath133 ) . when the observed tf scatter @xmath134 is taken into account a significant disagreement with observations",

    "we have applied the same statistical tests to the subsample corresponding to mathewson data and we find similar results than those of the total sample .",
    "it should be noted that the variations on the statistics arising from different observers are significantly enhanced when errors on the peculiar velocities are included .",
    "this fact make more difficult the distinction between the models .",
    "error bars in figures 1 to 5 show the variations of the results arising from different observer positions in the models and serve as a test for the dependence of the observational results on our particular position in space . in our analysis of biased models",
    "we have not found relevant differences in the results of the statistical analysis of samples with different density thresholds .",
    "the selection of low ( high ) density particles in the simulations does not produce very relevant effects in the statistics although lower ( higher ) values of @xmath69 and @xmath68 are observed due to the oversampling ( undersampling ) of high density particles where random motions dominate .",
    "finally when comparing models and observations , we find that neither the k , k1 , m , nor @xmath69 statistical tests are sensitive to the density parameter of the models .    we find crucial to consider properly the intrinsic scatter of the tully - fisher relation in studies of the peculiar velocity field .",
