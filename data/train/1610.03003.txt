    "information about the short - lived nuclei are essential to revealing some of the long - standing mysteries of the astrophysical rapid proton capture process ( @xmath2-process ) @xcite , namely , the main astronomical site and its mechanism . @xmath0 decay can be a good way to study some specific resonances in the daughter nucleus under some stellar environments , for example , determine the spin and parity of the resonances populated in the @xmath0 decay on the basis of the selection rules . a large number of decay channels including @xmath0-delayed particle emission will open due to the high @xmath0 decay energy and low separation energy of nucleons at the drip - lines .",
    "studies of the @xmath0 decay and @xmath0-delayed particle emission of exotic nuclei also advanced our understanding of the nature of the basic interactions which affect the structure of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4ne(@xmath5)@xmath1na reaction is part of the breakout sequence from the hot cno cycle , as @xmath1na is located on the onset of @xmath2-process .",
    "the reaction rate of ( @xmath5 ) reaction is dependent on resonance energies and resonance strengths ( @xmath6 ) . for the @xmath4ne(@xmath5)@xmath1na reaction of astrophysical interest ,",
    "its reaction rate is dominated by low - energy resonant levels in @xmath1na .",
    "the nuclear properties ( excitation energy , spin and parity , partial decay widths ) of the states near and just above the proton - separation threshold in @xmath1na play a key role to estimate the reaction rate .",
    "in particular , the first excited state above the threshold was found at 2645  kev in @xmath1na , whereas its property has been controversial for 30  years",
    "the resonance energy was well - known but only an upper limit of the resonance strength was obtained .",
    "a series of experimental and theoretical studies through the @xmath1ne(@xmath7)@xmath1na charge exchange reaction @xcite , the @xmath1ne(@xmath5)@xmath1na reaction with radioactive @xmath4ne beams via inverse - kinematics method @xcite , shell - model calculations @xcite , and various other approaches @xcite have been conducted .",
    "however , the spin and parity assignment of the state is unsettled even after these extensive investigations .",
    "the two most likely spin and parity for this state are 1@xmath8 and 3@xmath8 .",
    "the state can be populated in the allowed transition of @xmath1 mg in the former case while in the latter case the transition will be strongly forbidden @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 mg can be used as an alternative way to investigate the configuration of the 2645  kev state in @xmath1na . apart from the measurement of the decay properties of the resonances populated in the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 mg , other motivations for studying the @xmath0 decay of the lightest bound magnesium isotope , i.e.",
    ", @xmath1 mg are to measure the @xmath0 decay strength distribution and investigate the quenching of gamow - teller strength in @xmath0 decay , to test the isobaric multiplet mass equation and to study the isospin symmetry in comparison with the mirror decay and the mirror nucleus @xcite .    the @xmath0 decay study of @xmath9 proton - rich nucleus @xmath1 mg has been performed with various detection methods .",
    "the @xmath0-delayed protons from @xmath1 mg decay were first observed through helium - jet techniques by d. m. moltz _",
    "et al_. @xcite in 1979 , providing the first test of the validity of the isobaric multiplet mass equation for the @xmath10 quintet in spite of the low statistics and the high contamination from @xmath1na . in 1992 ,",
    "two @xmath0-delayed proton spectroscopic studies of @xmath1 mg were performed by s. kubono _",

    "both of them implanted the projectile fragments into silicon detectors and more @xmath0-delayed proton peaks from @xmath1 mg decay were observed .",
    "s. kubono _",
    "et al _ estimated an upper limit of 1% for the branching ratio to the 2637  kev state in @xmath1na and assigned this state to be the analog of the 3175  kev 1@xmath11 state in @xmath1f , while j. grres _",
    "reduced this upper limit to 0.2% .",
    "the most comprehensive @xmath0 decay spectroscopy of @xmath1 mg was performed by a. piechaczek _",
    "et al_. @xcite in 1995 .",
    "both of the protons and @xmath12-rays were measured , from which an improved decay scheme of @xmath1 mg was constructed .",
    "an upper limit of 0.1% for the branching ratio to the 2645  kev state was determined as well . recently in 2012 , j. p. wallace _ et al_. @xcite performed a @xmath0-delayed proton spectroscopic study by implanting the ions into a very thin double - sided silicon strip detector .",
    "they reported a more stringent upper limit on the branching ratio to the 2647  kev state of 0.02% with a 90% confidence level , which strongly supported a 3@xmath11 assignment , being the analog of the 2966  kev 3@xmath11 state in @xmath1f .",
    "a breakdown of the isobaric multiplet mass equation in the @xmath13 quintet was reported by a. t. gallant _ et al_. @xcite .",

    "the isobaric multiplet mass equation for the @xmath10 quintet was found to be revalidated .",
    "it is a serious challenge to assign the proton peaks to the right decay branches and reconstruct the decay scheme as numerous states in @xmath1na and the proton daughter nucleus @xmath4ne are populated in the @xmath0 decay of @xmath1 mg @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we report the detailed information about the complicated decay of @xmath1 mg obtained by measuring the emitted particles and @xmath12-rays in the @xmath0 decay with high efficiency and high resolution . for the sake of completeness , the preliminary results of an experiment @xcite performed a few months after the present experiment were also included in this paper .",
    "the experiment was performed at the heavy ion research facility of lanzhou ( hirfl ) @xcite in december 2014 . a @xmath15si primary beam at 75.8  mev / nucleon with an intensity of @xmath1637  ena ( @xmath162.6  pna ) impinged on a 1500  @xmath17 m thick @xmath18be target .",
    "the main setting of the radioactive ion beam line in lanzhou ( ribll ) @xcite for the selection of the secondary beam was optimised on @xmath19si , and the relevant results will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the ions in the secondary beam were identified by energy - loss ( @xmath20 ) and time - of - flight ( tof ) with respect to two focus planes of the ribll given by silicon detectors and two scintillation detectors , respectively . in the secondary beam ,",
    "the accompanying @xmath1 mg ions were provided with an average intensity of 0.59  particles per second and an average purity of 0.13% . in order to develop an advanced detection system with high detection efficiency and low detection threshold for charged - particle in the decay ,",
    "several technologies and solutions were conceived and implemented .",
    "details concerning the detection setup were described in ref .",
    "@xcite , and here we give only the main features .",
    "the isotopes of interest were implanted into two double - sided silicon strip detectors ( dssd1 of 149  @xmath17 m thickness and dssd2 of 66  @xmath17 m thickness ) , which also served as the subsequent decay detectors .",
    "a 314  @xmath17 m thick quadrant silicon detector @xcite ( qsd1 ) was mounted downstream to serve as an anticoincidence of the penetrating heavy ions and also to detect the charged particles escaping from the dssd2 .",
    "a 1546  @xmath17 m thick qsd2 was installed downstream to detect the @xmath0 particles . qsd3 and",
    "qsd4 , each with a thickness of @xmath16300  @xmath17 m , were installed at the end to suppress the possible disturbances from the penetrating light particles ( @xmath21h , @xmath22h , @xmath23h , and @xmath24he ) coming along with the beam .",
    "besides , the silicon detectors were surrounded by five clover - type hpge detectors , which were employed to measure the @xmath12-rays . in front of the silicon detectors array ,",
    "an aluminum degrader was installed to adjust the stopping range of the ions in the dssds .",
    "the known @xmath0-delayed protons from @xmath25 mg decay @xcite measured in the previous stage of the experiment were used for the energy calibrations of the dssds .",
    "the known @xmath0-delayed @xmath12-rays from @xmath19 mg decay @xcite and @xmath26si decay @xcite measured in the latter stage of the experiment were used for the absolute efficiency calibrations of the clover detectors .",

    "the total @xmath0-delayed particle spectrum from @xmath1 mg decay measured by the two dssds is presented in fig .  [ particlespec ] .",
    "the time difference between an implantation event and all the subsequent decay events was limited within five half - life windows ( 450  ms ) .",
    "charged - particles escaping from the dssd will deposit incomplete energies in the dssd and the residual energies of the escaping charged - particles can be measured by the other dssd with high efficiency . fig .",
    "[ particlespec ] shows the sum of the deposited energy in dssd1 and dssd2 .",
    "the @xmath0 pile - up effect of the particle spectrum can be reduced by requiring a coincidence with @xmath0 signals in the qsd2 .",

    ", a @xmath162340 kev peak was indicated in the @xmath0-delayed particle spectrum from @xmath1 mg decay .",
    "it is to be noted that the shape of their @xmath162340 kev peak is much broader than those of other peaks , while the relatively better resolution and higher sensitivity achieved in the present work made it possible to clearly distinguish the two peaks unresolved in their @xmath162340 kev peak .",
    "the proton decay branching ratios can be calculated by counting the @xmath0-delayed proton decay events in the particle spectrum , divided by the numbers of the implanted @xmath1 mg ions .",
