    "magnetic fields are important for understanding galactic dynamics and star formation processes . to date , various methods for measuring interstellar magnetic fields",
    "have been devised to probe the star - forming regions in our galaxy and in external galaxies @xcite . when background starlight passes through dust grains aligned with the local magnetic field , the light is linearly polarized by dichroic extinction parallel to the grain s long axis .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is a unique target for studying magnetic fields and star - forming processes . due to its proximity and",
    "face - on orientation , large - scale interactions with the halo of the milky way and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , and small - scale structures of the local star - forming regions , can be traced @xcite .",
    "previous studies of magnetic fields in the lmc were carried out using multi - frequency surveys of diffuse synchrotron emission in radio bands @xcite .",
    "optical polarization @xcite have shown the existence of large - scale magnetic fields in the lmc .",
    "however , these results were restricted to only bright stars .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter w07 ) also showed the detailed polarization map of ngc 2100 on the eastern side of 30 doradus and its surrounding regions , in optical bands .",
    "the near - infrared band has an advantage over the optical band .",
    "this is because the background starlight in star - forming regions suffers heavy extinction @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter n07 ) studied magnetic field structures 7.7@xmath0 @xmath1 7.7@xmath0 around 30 doradus using near - ir polarimetry .",
    "they revealed more detailed magnetic field structures that are aligned roughly in the east - west direction compared with the previous results in the optical band @xcite .",
    "these field structures are associated with expanding shells around 30 doradus .",
    "we carried out a near - ir photometric and polarimetric study for the 39@xmath0 @xmath1 69@xmath0 fields in the northeastern part of the lmc .",
    "the target fields contain four important star - forming regions , 30 doradus , n158 , n159 and n160 . the initial investigation of polarimetric data around 30 doradus was presented in @xcite .",
    "however , the survey was limited to a 20@xmath0 @xmath1 20@xmath0 region and the data were hampered by unstable weather conditions . in this paper , we analyzed additional data sets for more regions .",
    "the procedures to obtain the photometric results are described in section 2 .",
    "we compiled photometric and polarimetric data for each observation field in a catalog . in section 3 , we examined the origin of the polarization , based on the wavelength dependence . in section 4 , we showed polarization vector maps for each observation field and discussed the related magnetic field structures .",
    "we also calculated magnetic field strengths in five sample fields .",
    "finally , we discussed the correlation of our polarization results with dust emission and co distribution .",
    "we observed the northeastern regions in the lmc with the infrared camera sirius @xcite and the polarimeter sirpol @xcite at the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) 1.4 m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) on 2008 december 25@xmath530 and 2011 december 2@xmath511 .",

    "we checked the output magnitude variations in 40 sequential frames to filter bad data affected by non - photometric weathers . the fields with magnitude variation larger than 0.03 mag were rejected ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we used source extractor ( sextractor ) for source detection and aperture photometry @xcite .",
    "various sextractor parameters were optimized ( i.e. , detection threshold of 5 @xmath10 , background box size of 16 pixels , background filter of 3 @xmath1 3 meshes , and aperture diameter of 8 pixels ) .",
    "we measured the instrumental magnitudes of stars for four wave - plate angles in the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 bands .",
    "the pixel coordinates of the sources were converted to celestial coordinates using the 2mass all sky point source catalogue @xcite .",
    "the instrumental magnitude and color were calibrated using the equations below : + @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the instrumental magnitudes and the colors from the stokes @xmath15 images , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the magnitude and the color in the 2mass system .",

    "@xcite first formulated the wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization in the galaxy , and @xcite modified the empirical relationship between the wavelength and the size of the dust grains .",

    "for the 30 doradus region , n07 presented a slightly different power - law index of @xmath19 @xmath54 0.9 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig7 ] , our result is consistent with that of n07 . for your reference , we also plotted the sources matched with the akari lmc point - source catalog to check the possibility of intrinsic polarization ( see section [ sec : akari_mir ] for details ) .",

    "this means that the observed polarization in the lmc is of interstellar origin .",
    "@xmath55 stars are often associated with nebulosity and therefore the polarization might be intrinsic rather than interstellar .",
    "we examine this possibility from mid - infrared observation data of the akari lmc point - source catalog . using a color - color diagram and a color - magnitude diagram of the five photometric bands at 3.2 , 7 , 11 , 15 , and 24 @xmath6 m ,",
    "@xcite classified the sources with dusty c - rich and o - rich @xmath55 stars .    in our catalog ,",
    "208 sources have been matched to the akari lmc point sources in the 3.2 , 7 , and 11 @xmath6 m bands .",
    "the matched akari sources were divided into @xmath55 stars without dusty envelope and dusty c - rich / o - rich @xmath55 stars .",
    "however , distributions of the polarization degrees and position angles do not show any significant differences between two groups .",
    "in addition , the matched akari sources do not show any different power - law relationship ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this implies that the detected polarization is of interstellar origin rather than being intrinsic to @xmath55 stars .",
    "figures  [ fig9 ] and  [ fig10 ] show the @xmath2-band polarization maps in the observed lmc fields .",
    "each vector represents a point source with @xmath42 @xmath43 3 .",
    "the number of selected stars was 875 , 1,468 , and 732 , in the @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 bands , respectively .",
    "most of these vectors are directed either from north to south or from northeast to southwest .    in the region around 30 doradus ( figure  [ fig9 ] ) , most of the polarization vectors have directions from northeast to southwest . in the southeastern region from 30 doradus , the distribution of polarization vectors shows a shell - like structure encircling @xmath56 field .",
    "w07 presented the magnetic field structure of ngc 2100 , of which the western part overlapped our fields .",
    "the polarization feature in the region of overlap shows similar polarization vector patterns .",
    "w07 reported that the origin of the magnetic field geometry around ngc 2100 includes massive outflows moving eastward from the 30 doradus region .",
    "the coherent pattern of the polarization vectors in the north and south of @xmath56 field is consistent with that of w07 .",
    "they reported that the pattern is influenced by magnetic field lines along the eastward outflows .",
    "in addition , other patterns in @xmath56 field can be explained by interaction between the environment of ngc 2100 and the eastward outflows .",
    "the large - scale outflow from 30 doradus is one plausible source of the influence on the structural formation of the supergiant shell on the western side of 30 doradus ( lmc 3 region ) .",
    "overall vectors in the western regions of 30 doradus show coherent patterns toward the direction of the lmc 3 region identified in previous studies @xcite . as suggested by w07 ,",
    "the extended uniform patterns of a magnetic field can be a clue to large - scale outflows toward the boundaries of a supergiant shell .",
    "the polarization vectors in figure  [ fig10 ] show complex distribution . at the eastern part ,",
    "most of the polarization vectors are directed north - south .",
    "however , vectors at the other side show a different distribution structure , more like a tilted s - shape .",
    "we suspect that these patterns of polarization vectors are related to the magnetic field lines south of 30 doradus .",

    "we examined the magnetic field strength of the fields overlapped with those described by w07 and other sample fields using the analysis of @xcite , which is described by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean density , @xmath59 is the velocity dispersion in the line - of - sight , and @xmath60 is the dispersion in the gaussian fit of polarization position angles .",
    "@xcite presented a 21 cm neutral hydrogen interferometric survey of the lmc in a catalog of hi gas clumps or clouds with 16 , 32 , and 64 k brightness temperature thresholds . by matching their catalog locations with positions of our observed fields",
    ", we obtained @xmath59 from their survey results .",
    "the applied @xmath59 of the matched sample fields are tabulated in table  [ tbl-4 ] .",
    "as @xcite reported , the value of a factor of order unity , q , shows the best result when the value from @xcite is adopted . by simulation",
    ", @xcite determined that q is approximately 0.46@xmath50.51 , when the observed dispersions in polarization position angles indicate relatively strong magnetic field strengths ( @xmath60 @xmath49 25@xmath9 ) .",
    "we set the value of q to be 0.5 , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we used column ( 14 ) in table  [ tbl-3 ] to select sample fields showing coherent distribution of polarization position angles . for the coherent distribution",
    ", @xmath60 was calculated by a gaussian fit centered at average polarization position angles in table  [ tbl-3 ] .",
    "we tested whether the distribution of polarization position angles is well fitted to a gaussian distribution by applying the martinez - iglewicz normality test @xcite , @xmath61 where @xmath15 is the martinez - iglewicz test statistic , @xmath62 is average polarization position angles in the @xmath2 band .",
    "if the distribution possesses significant deviation from normality , it indicates the presence of possible sub - structure . to eliminate these cases , we selected fields showing test value @xmath15 close to @xmath441@xmath44 ( table  [ tbl-4 ] ) .",
    "w07 used hi number density from @xcite to estimate mean density in their observed fields .",
    "we also assumed the number density of 4 @xmath63 as used in w07 .",
    "as seen in table  [ tbl-4 ] , we tabulated the magnetic field strengths for the five sample fields .",
    "one of them is the same region considered in w07 , and it shows a similar magnetic field strength .",
    "the derived magnetic field strengths and sizes of the selected regions are similar to the properties of a typical cloud complex ( i.e. , scale 10@xmath5100 parsecs and magnetic field strength ranging from 10 to 30 @xmath6 g ) as reported by @xcite .      in order to understand the pattern of polarization vectors , we examined our @xmath2-band polarization map by comparing the literature on mid to far - infrared dust emission maps and co gas emission maps .",
    "we assume that the position angle of polarization indicates the direction of the magnetic field , because the observed polarization originated from interstellar dust grains with short axis aligned with the local magnetic field in the lmc .",
    "the irac data ( 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8 @xmath6 m ) from the spitzer sage @xcite were compiled to trace dust emission features in the lmc fields more clearly .",
    "although we have done a comparison with the herschel data ( 100 , 160 , and 250 @xmath6 m ) from the heritage project @xcite , we did not find any features different from those in the spitzer data , due to relatively poor resolution .",
    "the irac data are displayed as a color composite image ( shown in figures  [ fig11 ] and  [ fig12 ] ) , and we overlaid our polarization vector map on these figures .",
    "the polarization vectors showing prominent patterns indicate the direction of the local magnetic field lines and we indicated these patterns with a green shaded curve in both figure  [ fig11 ] and  [ fig12 ] .",
    "the overall trend of the polarization vectors shows east - west direction across the 30 doradus region ( p1 in figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "other distinctive patterns of polarization vectors are located at the outskirts field of 30 doradus , associated with dust emission features ( p2 , p3 , and p4 in figure  [ fig11 ] ) .",
    "p2 is located at the northwestern boundary of the dust emission feature and it shows a u - shaped structure .",
    "n07 found a similar u - shaped structure of polarization vectors , and they proposed that expanding shells in 30 doradus affected complex cloud structures and the associated magnetic field .",
    "p3 and p4 exhibit apparent patterns with similar direction to that of bright emission features .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows the distribution of polarization vectors mainly following the molecular cloud ridge around star - forming regions of n158 , n160 , and n159 .",
    "the vectors located at pattern p1 show distinct elongation extending southward , with direction similar to that of the dust emission structure .",
    "p2 also shows a uniform pattern directed north - south direction , but its shape is slightly curved along the dust emission feature .",
    "these patterns ( p1 and p2 ) are regarded as magnetic field lines related to the extended feature of the molecular cloud ridge . however , polarization vectors located at the southwestern part of figure  [ fig12 ] show patterns different from those of the eastern part .",
    "polarization vectors in patterns p3 and p4 tend to be aligned in a tilted s - shape and east - west , respectively .",
    "we observed that the dust emission feature in the southwestern part of figure  [ fig12 ] seems to be extended in this direction .",
    "on the other hand , polarization vectors in the star - forming regions ( central part of 30 doradus in figure  [ fig11 ] and bright emission features in figure  [ fig12 ] ) do not show any significant pattern .",
    "this is thought to be due to the turbulent and complex magnetic fields of the sub - structures in the star - forming region . to verify the structure of the expected turbulent magnetic fields ,",
    "more detailed polarimetric data are required .",
    "we also did a comparison with a velocity - integrated contour map of @xmath64co emission .",
    "nanten @xmath64co(@xmath3=1 - 0 ) emissions have been detected in giant molecular cloud complexes in the lmc @xcite .",
    "although prominent @xmath64co emission features are located in the central 30 doradus region , and in star - forming regions in the southern molecular cloud ridge , close correlation between magnetic fields and @xmath64co emission features was not found .",
    "we concluded that the observed polarization vectors reflect a dust cloud structure resulting in polarization by dichroic extinction , and that they trace magnetic fields associated with dust clouds around star - forming region .",
    "we conducted near - ir imaging polarimetry for a large areal region covering ( @xmath65 ) on the eastern side of the lmc .",
    "we made a band - merged catalog of photometric and polarimetric data in @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 bands . in this catalog",
    ", we compiled 1,858 stars in the region , brighter than 14 mag in @xmath2 band and @xmath42 @xmath43 3 for least one band . the magnitude",
    ", polarization degree and polarization position angle were listed in the catalog .",
    "in addition , we provided information on absolute proper motion and magnitudes of @xmath66 and @xmath67 matched from spm data . using this catalog , we obtained polarization vector maps and did a statistical analysis of polarization for the fields observed in the lmc .",
    "previous similar catalogs did not cover such a large continuous area of the lmc ( e.g. , @xmath68 by w07 ) , nor did they use the infrared range . therefore , this catalog is a unique , up - to - date collection of polarization measurements for the lmc region .",
    "the degree of polarization for the 106 sources in our catalog shows wavelength dependence similar to those reported by n07 .",
    "we concluded that most of the sources in our catalog exhibit interstellar polarization , and that the dominant polarization mechanism is the result of dichroic extinction by dust grains aligned along magnetic fields , rather than due to intrinsic polarization of stars . using the polarization vector maps",
    ", we traced the correlation of the polarization and the large - scale magnetic field structures in the observed regions .",
    "the geometry of the large - scale magnetic field structures around 30 doradus , and of the southern star - forming regions , show relationships with the environment of nearby supergiant shells and the gaseous spiral features toward the south , respectively .",
    "the estimated magnetic field strengths for the selected fields ( within one hundred parsecs ) are in the range 3@xmath525 @xmath6 g , as determined by the chandrasekhar - fermi method .",
    "judging from their size and magnetic field strength , those regions are regarded as a cloud complex associated with a nebula in the lmc .",
    "prominent patterns of polarization vectors mainly follow dust emission features in mid to far - infrared bands , which implies that the large - scale magnetic fields are well involved in the structures of the dust cloud in the lmc , except for the dense star - forming regions .",
    "the cross matching of the data in this catalog , with that in other catalogs for in the lmc , will give useful information for probing the structure of magnetic fields and other astrophysical phenomena .",
