    "observers play a central role in quantum mechanics but there exists no measure of intrinsic information associated with a quantum state . the notions from classical information theory can not be applied directly here because of the fundamental uncertainty in the quantum description . for example , after the spin of a spin-@xmath3 particle has been measured to be in a particular direction , there is still the probability @xmath4 that it will have a spin in a new direction at an angle of @xmath5 from the previous one . or a photon that has been polarized in a certain direction will still have a certain probability of being found in other directions .",
    "each such measurement , thus , provides new information .",
    "this phenomenon of endless information is the flip side of uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , the question of information can be made meaningful if it is connected to the nature of the measurement apparatus .",
    "quantum interference experiments on single photons or other particles reveal that the results give us information about the measuring apparatus ; the photon ` senses ' the entire measuring apparatus and it can not be considered to be localized [ 3 - 8 ] .",
    "it is due to this property that interaction - free measurements can be performed@xcite .",
    "it stands to reason that if the measurement system is more intricate than an interferometer , this increased complexity will be correspondingly reflected in the measurement .",
    "we consider the situation when the apparatus is linearly distributed .",
    "we ask the question whether the last measurement in this apparatus can reveal to us information regarding the previous stages of the apparatus . in other words , we wish to speak not of any _ intrinsic _ information of the object , but rather of the change caused by the object in the information of the classical distributed apparatus .",
    "we first look at the information that can be extracted from a photon . a qubit is a quantum state of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 are in general complex numbers and @xmath8 the information that can be extracted from a qubit depends on the measurement apparatus .",
    "one may ask : what is the maximum information in bits that can be obtained from a qubit ? we do not answer this question directly , but show how the information in a qubit can depend on the measurement apparatus and present a scheme where it can exceed two bits .    for convenience , we assume that the qubits are coded in the polarization of photons .",
    "the states @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent horizontally and vertically polarized photons , respectively .",
    "the information exchange protocol may be defined by the transmission , according to a clock , of photons , which are detected using appropriate polarizing filters .",
    "it is quite clear that at each tick of the clock one could easily look for one of at least three possibilities    @xmath11    this can be accomplished by a detector which is a horizontally polarizing filter that is followed by a photo - detector @xmath12 .",
    "the polarizing filter is itself hooked to a measurement apparatus @xmath13 which can determine whether the filter has absorbed any photons .",
    "this is shown in figure 1 .",
    "if we represent the two @xmath14 measurements as a vector , we have the following possibilites :    .detector values and the corresponding states [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     this forms three classes with probabilities of @xmath15 .",
    "the average information provided by this is @xmath16  bits .",
    "this example illustrates how the task of computing the intensity spectrum is equivalent to determining the partitions of @xmath0 .",
    "the properties of the partition function are well known .",
    "it is known that the partition function @xmath17 satisfies the following property@xcite :    @xmath18    for large @xmath0 , we can use the approximation    @xmath19    since the partitions define the number of classes of the intensity spectrum at the detector , we can compute the average information @xmath20 by using the actual probabilities for the classes .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 . if all of these classes were equally likely , then the information is    @xmath21    since the equal probability case represents the maximum entropy , the relation ( 9 ) is an upper bound for the measurement arrangement described in the paper .    for convenience , this relation may be written as    @xmath22    since , the class membership is based on the combinations of the different partitions of @xmath0 , rather than the combinations of @xmath0 directly as in the binomial distribution , the discrepancy between the actual information value and its upper bound is much less in the quantum case as compared to the classical case .",
    "the analysis done in this paper shows that a quantum measurement gives information roughly @xmath23 times that provided by the corresponding classical measurement , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "as @xmath0 becomes large , the advantage over classical measurement becomes enormous .",
    "put differently , for the same performance , one would need of the order of @xmath24 classical elements where only @xmath0 quantum elements would suffice .",
    "this exponential advantage is what makes quantum algorithms for solving problems faster than the corresponding classical algorithms .",
    "this is also the explanation for why , from a computational point of view , quantum interactions are so fundamentally different from classical interactions .",
    "this paper has considered the nature of the measurement process from the point of view of intrinsic information .",
    "another perspective is to study situations which depart from classical logic ; these include the aharonov - bohm , the epr , and the hansbury brown - twiss effects@xcite .",
    "a setting for detection of objects without any interactions with the object was presented by elitzur and vaidman@xcite with the mach - zehnder particle interferometer as the measurement apparatus .",
    "when both paths are clear , the particles are registered in one detector only .",
    "but if one of the paths is blocked then there is a fifty percent chance that the other detector will receive the particle .",
    "if this happens , then clearly one has determined the blockage of the path without having interacted with the object of the blockage . using the notion of distributed measurement@xcite",
    ", the percentage for detecting without interaction can be further increased .",
    "if the photons are transmitted over two paths rather than one , we increase the variables that can be changed .",
    "the research reported in this paper suggests several new investigations .",
    "one may wish to examine apparatus which is distributed in more than one spatial dimension and study the use of entangled states as well as that of coupled epr particles ."
