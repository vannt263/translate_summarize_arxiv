    "reflected brownian motions in a wedge with constant reflection angles on the two sides were characterized by varadhan and williams in  @xcite .",
    "recent work by lawler , schramm and werner  @xcite on sle establishes a connection between one of these reflected brownian motions ( with reflection angles of  @xmath0 with respect to the boundary ) , chordal sle@xmath1 and the exploration process of critical percolation .",
    "they show that these three processes generate the same hull , using an argument that we shall outline in the following paragraph .",
    "the connection was carried even further by julien dubdat  @xcite .",
    "he compared sle@xmath1 and the aforementioned reflected brownian motion in an equilateral triangle , started from a given corner and conditioned to cross the triangle to a given point  @xmath2 on the opposite side .",
    "for these two processes , he showed that the conditional probability that the side to the right of the starting point is the last side visited before reaching  @xmath2 , is the same .",
    "he also showed that , under the assumption that sle@xmath1 is the scaling limit of the exploration process of critical percolation , this conditional probability can be used to prove watts formula for critical percolation ( see  @xcite ) .    the argument used in  @xcite to establish",
    "the connection between the three models is as follows .",
    "let  @xmath3 be a stochastic process in an equilateral triangle  @xmath4 , started from a corner and stopped when it first hits the opposite side  @xmath5 .",
    "define the _ hull _",
    "@xmath6 as the compact set of points in  @xmath4 disconnected from  @xmath5 by the trace of  @xmath7 up to time  @xmath8 .",
    "denote by  @xmath2 the hitting point of  @xmath5 , and by  @xmath9 the hitting time .",
    "we shall refer to the probability distribution of the point  @xmath2 as the `` exit distribution '' .",
    "for all three processes mentioned above , the exit distribution is uniform on the side of the triangle . together with conformal invariance and the locality property ( see section  [ ssec : invariance ] below and  @xcite ) , shared by all three processes , this exit distribution determines the law of the hull  @xmath10 .",
    "the three processes therefore generate the same hull .",
    "this argument can be generalized to stochastic processes in arbitrary triangles that are conformally invariant and have the locality property : if the exit distributions of two such processes are the same , in particular if they are both uniform , then the processes generate the same hull .",
    "the papers of lawler , schramm , werner  @xcite and dubdat  @xcite show that in equilateral and isosceles triangles there exist reflected brownian motions that have uniform exit distributions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize this result to arbitrary triangles , to review properties of these reflected brownian motions and to discuss distribution functions associated with these processes and the hulls they generate .      to present an overview of the present paper , we first need to introduce some notation . given two angles @xmath11 such that @xmath12 , we define the wedge @xmath13 as the set @xmath14 .",
    "we also define @xmath15 as the triangle in the upper half of the complex plane such that one side coincides with the interval  @xmath16 , and the interior angles at the corners @xmath17 and  @xmath18 are equal to @xmath19 and  @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the third corner is at @xmath21 . when @xmath22 , the domain @xmath15 is similarly defined as the ( unbounded ) polygon having one side equal to the interval  @xmath16 , and interior angles @xmath19 and  @xmath20 at the corners @xmath17 and  @xmath18 .",
    "we then identify the point at  @xmath23 with the `` third corner ''  @xmath24 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath25 and  @xmath26 are two angles of reflection on the left and right sides of the wedge @xmath13 , respectively , measured from the boundary with small angles denoting reflection away from the origin ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we shall use the abbreviation rbm@xmath28 to denote the corresponding reflected brownian motion in the wedge @xmath13 . for a characterization and properties of these rbms , see varadhan and williams  @xcite ( note that here we use a different convention for the reflection angles , namely , the angles @xmath29 and  @xmath30 of varadhan and williams correspond in our notation to the angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that in every wedge  @xmath13 there is a unique rbm@xmath33 with the following property : started from the origin , the first hitting point of the rbm of any horizontal line segment intersecting the wedge is uniformly distributed .",
    "this special behaviour is obtained by taking the reflection angles equal to the angles of the wedge , that is , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . restricting the wedge to a triangle",
    "we can reformulate this result as follows :    [ the : main ] let @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and let  @xmath36 be an rbm@xmath37 in the triangle @xmath15 started from  @xmath24 and stopped when it hits  @xmath38 $ ]",
    ". set @xmath39\\}$ ] and @xmath40 .",
    "then  @xmath2 is uniform in  @xmath38 $ ] .    to prove this theorem",
    "we will cover the wedge  @xmath13 with a well - chosen lattice , and then define a random walk on this lattice . by construction , this random walk will have the desired property that it arrives on each horizontal row of vertices on the lattice with the uniform distribution . taking the scaling limit then yields the desired result .",
    "the proof is split in two sections . in section  [ sec : restricted ] we consider the easier case where the angles @xmath19 and  @xmath20 are in the range @xmath41 $ ] such that @xmath42 .",
    "section  [ sec : generic ] treats the extension to arbitrary triangles , which is considerably more involved .",
    "section  [ sec : properties ] collects some properties of the two - parameter family of rbms . in particular , as was noted by dubdat  @xcite , we can show from the discrete approximations that the imaginary parts of the rbms are essentially 3-dimensional bessel processes .",
    "this allows us to describe the time - reversals of the rbms , and sheds some light on how the rbm@xmath37 behaves in the domain  @xmath15 for angles @xmath11 such that @xmath22 .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : distributions ] we compute several distribution functions associated with the rbms and the hulls they generate .",
    "this also reveals intriguing connections between rbms started from different corners of the same triangle .",
    "throughout this section , we assume that the angles @xmath19 and  @xmath20 are fixed and restricted to the range  @xmath41 $ ] such that @xmath43 . we shall construct a random walk in the wedge  @xmath44 whose scaling limit is an rbm@xmath37 and whose horizontal coordinate is uniformly distributed all the time , and thereby prove theorem  [ the : main ] for these restricted values of @xmath19 and  @xmath20 .",
    "the generalization to a generic triangle will be treated in section  [ sec : generic ] .          throughout this paper",
    "we shall make use of a distorted triangular lattice , defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath45 and  @xmath46 be two angles in the range @xmath41 $ ] such that @xmath47 ( as we shall see later on , the range for @xmath45 and  @xmath46 is chosen such that the transition probabilities for our random walk are positive ) .",
    "we define @xmath48 as the set of vertices @xmath49 building the triangular lattice depicted in figure  [ fig : lattice ] . throughout the paper",
    "we shall make use of the variables @xmath50 , @xmath51 and  @xmath52 to denote the lattice dimensions .",
    "when we use these variables , the values of @xmath45 and  @xmath46 will always be clear from the context .    to introduce some further notation ,",
    "let us first consider how one defines a random walk @xmath53 on  @xmath48 that converges to standard complex brownian motion in the full plane , before we consider the random walk in the wedge  @xmath54 in the following subsection .",
    "we set @xmath55 and for each @xmath56 , @xmath57 is chosen among the nearest - neighbours of  @xmath58 according to the probabilities @xmath59 , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 as depicted in figure  [ fig : lattice ] .",
    "we may then write the position  @xmath57 of the random walk as a sum of steps @xmath62 where each step  @xmath63 is a complex - valued random variable taking on the possible values @xmath64    to obtain a two - dimensional brownian motion as the scaling limit of the random walk  @xmath65 , it is sufficient that the covariance matrix of the real and imaginary parts @xmath66 and  @xmath67 of each step is a multiple of the identity .",
    "this gives two equations for the probabilities @xmath59 , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 : @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath59 , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 can be determined from these equations , yielding @xmath71 where @xmath72^{-1}$ ] is the normalization constant .",
    "one may verify that @xmath45 and  @xmath46 must satisfy @xmath47 to make all three probabilities nonnegative .",
    "we conclude this subsection with a short discussion of how one obtains the scaling limit of the random walk  @xmath65 .",
    "to do so , for every natural number  @xmath73 one may define the continuous - time , complex - valued stochastic process  @xmath74 as the linear interpolation of the process @xmath75 making jumps at the times @xmath76 . here , @xmath77 is the variance of the real and imaginary parts of the steps  @xmath78 , that is , @xmath79={\\mathop{\\rm\\bf\\null e}\\nolimits}[v_n^2]$ ] .",
    "it is then standard that @xmath80 converges weakly to a complex brownian motion in the full complex plane  @xmath81 when @xmath82 ( topological aspects are as described in the introduction of varadhan and williams  @xcite ) .",
    "we now return to the wedge @xmath83 with angles @xmath19 and  @xmath20 fixed in the range  @xmath41 $ ] such that @xmath84 .",
    "clearly , this wedge is covered nicely with vertices of the lattice  @xmath48 when we set @xmath85 and  @xmath86 , see figure  [ fig : wedgesimple ] . for the duration of this section we consider these values of @xmath45 and  @xmath46 to be fixed .",
    "later , when we generalize to arbitrary triangles , the relation between @xmath87 and @xmath88 will not be so simple , which is why we already reserve the symbols @xmath87 to denote the angles of the lattice .",
    "we shall denote by  @xmath89 the set of vertices obtained by taking the intersection of  @xmath90 with  @xmath91 .",
    "we shall call the vertices of  @xmath92 having six nearest neighbours along the lattice directions _ interior vertices_. the origin will be called the _ apex _ of  @xmath92 , and the remaining vertices will be referred to as the _ boundary vertices_. the set of boundary vertices may be further subdivided into _ left boundary vertices _ and _ right boundary vertices _ , with the obvious interpretation .        given a vertex  @xmath93 of  @xmath92 , a reflected random walk @xmath94 on  @xmath92",
    "is defined as follows .",
    "we set @xmath95 and for each  @xmath56 , if @xmath96 is an interior vertex , then @xmath97 is chosen among the six nearest - neighbours of  @xmath96 according to the probabilities @xmath59 , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 as before .",
    "this guarantees that the scaling limit of the random walk is brownian motion in the interior of the wedge .",
    "it remains to specify the transition probabilities for the random walk from the boundary vertices and the apex .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case where the transition probabilities on all left boundary vertices are the same , and likewise for the right boundary vertices .",
    "we write @xmath98 $ ] for the expected value of the first step of the random walk started from the vertex  @xmath99 , and assume that it is nonzero at all the boundary vertices and the apex . then",
    ", as we shall prove in section  [ ssec : scalinglimit ] , the random walk converges to a reflected brownian motion .",
    "moreover , the directions of reflection on the sides of the wedge are given by the directions of @xmath98 $ ] at the left and right boundary vertices .",
    "it follows that by playing with the transition probabilities from the boundary vertices we can obtain different rbms in the scaling limit .",
    "there is , however , only one choice of transition probabilities for which the random walk has the following special property : started from the origin , the random walk first arrives on any row of the lattice with the uniform distribution on the vertices of that row .",
    "we will refer to this special case as the _ uniform ( random ) walk_. to derive its transition probabilities one proceeds as follows . in a picture where we represent the steps of the walk by arrows",
    ", we have to make sure that every vertex in a given row has two incoming arrows with probability  @xmath60 from vertices in the same row , and two incoming arrows with probabilities @xmath59 and  @xmath61 from vertices in the rows above and below .",
    "this completely determines the transition probabilities from the boundary vertices , see figure  [ fig : wedgesimple ] for a picture of the solution .    in formula , if  @xmath93 is a left boundary vertex , then we have the following transition probabilities for the uniform walk : @xmath100 = p[x , x + ( u+v ) ] = b , \\\\   & & p[x , x + u + { { \\rm i}}h ] = a , \\\\   & & p[x , x - u - { { \\rm i}}h ] = a+c , \\\\   & & p[x , x + v - { { \\rm i}}h ] = c,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the transition probabilities from the right boundary vertices are defined symmetrically , as shown in figure  [ fig : wedgesimple ] . at the apex",
    "we simply choose the transition probabilities to each the two vertices directly below the apex equal to  @xmath101 .",
    "it will now be convenient to decompose the position  @xmath97 at each step of the uniform walk as @xmath102 .",
    "then @xmath103 is a nonnegative integer denoting a row of vertices on the lattice , and @xmath104 is a nonnegative integer denoting the position on the @xmath103th row . observe that there are a total of @xmath105 vertices on the @xmath106th row , so that @xmath104 ranges from @xmath17 to @xmath107 .",
    "henceforth , we shall always adopt this convention of numbering rows on the lattice in top - down order , and vertices on each row from left to right .    by construction ,",
    "the uniform random walk  @xmath108 started from the origin has the property that at every time @xmath109 , the position of the walker is uniformly distributed on the rows of the lattice .",
    "more precisely , for the uniform walk  @xmath108 the following lemma holds :    [ lem : uniform ] for all  @xmath110 , if @xmath111 is a sequence of natural numbers such that @xmath112 and @xmath113 for all @xmath114 , then for each @xmath115 , @xmath116       = { \\mathop{\\rm\\bf\\null p}\\nolimits}[j_n = j\\mid k_n = k_n ] = \\frac{1}{n(k_n)}.\\ ] ] in particular , if @xmath117 and @xmath118 is the first time at which the walk visits row  @xmath106 , then for each @xmath119 , @xmath120 = \\frac{1}{n(k)}.\\ ] ]    the first claim of the lemma is proved by induction . for @xmath121 the claim is trivial . for  @xmath122 , @xmath123\\phantom{\\int_i } } \\nonumber\\\\    & & = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{k_{n-1 } } { \\mathop{\\rm\\bf\\null p}\\nolimits}[j_n = j , k_n = k_n\\mid k_{n-1}=k_{n-1}]\\ ,             { \\mathop{\\rm\\bf\\null p}\\nolimits}[k_{n-1}=k_{n-1 } ] }            { \\sum\\limits_{k_{n-1 } } { \\mathop{\\rm\\bf\\null p}\\nolimits}[k_n = k_n\\mid k_{n-1}=k_{n-1}]\\ ,             { \\mathop{\\rm\\bf\\null p}\\nolimits}[k_{n-1}=k_{n-1}]}.    \\label{equ : uniform }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the induction hypothesis , it is easy to compute the conditional probabilities in the numerator and denominator of this expression from the transition probabilities given earlier .",
    "we first assume  @xmath124 .",
    "then for @xmath125 these conditional probabilities are @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath128 they are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , and for all other  @xmath131 they vanish .",
    "when @xmath132 the contributions from the apex take a different form , but the computation is equally straightforward . now observe that the quotient in equation  ( [ equ : uniform ] ) has the same value if the event @xmath133 is replaced by @xmath134 .",
    "the first claim of the lemma follows .",
    "the second claim of the lemma is then a straightforward consequence .    to prove convergence of the uniform walk to a reflected brownian motion",
    ", we shall need an estimate on the local time spent by the walk on the boundary vertices of  @xmath92 .",
    "this estimate is provided by lemma  [ lem : localtime ] below .",
    "the proof of lemma  [ lem : localtime ] is postponed to section  [ ssec : intertwiningdiscrete ] , since the proof will give us some intermediate results that we will need only in section  [ sec : properties ] .",
    "consider the walk  @xmath108 , killed when it reaches row  @xmath135 , and let  @xmath93 be a fixed boundary vertex of  @xmath92 .",
    "then the expected number of visits of  @xmath108 to  @xmath93 before it is killed is smaller than @xmath136 . [",
    "lem : localtime ]      given a point  @xmath93 in  @xmath54 , the scaling limit of the reflected random walk started from a vertex near  @xmath93 is obtained in a similar way as described in section  [ ssec : lattice ] .",
    "that is , if @xmath137 is a sequence in  @xmath92 such that @xmath138 for all @xmath139 , then for every natural number @xmath73 we define the continuous complex - valued stochastic process  @xmath140 as the linear interpolation of the process @xmath141 making jumps at the times @xmath76 . here",
    ", @xmath77 is again the variance of the real and imaginary parts of the steps @xmath142 of the random walk in the interior of the wedge .",
    "then it is clear that the random walk converges to a complex brownian motion in the interior , but the behaviour on the boundary is non - trivial .",
    "it is explained in dubdat  @xcite how one proves that the scaling limit of the random walk  @xmath143 is in fact reflected brownian motion with constant reflection angles on the two sides , started from  @xmath93 .",
    "the core of the argument identifies reflected brownian motion as the only possible weak limit  @xmath144 of  @xmath145 .",
    "we repeat this part of the argument below , mainly to allow us in section  [ sec : generic ] to point out some technical issues that need to be taken care of when we generalize to arbitrary triangles .",
    "we use the submartingale characterization of reflected brownian motion in  @xmath54 ( see  @xcite , theorem  2.1 ) , which states the following . let  @xmath146 be the set of bounded continuous real - valued functions on  @xmath54 that are twice continuously differentiable with bounded derivatives . assume that the two reflection angles @xmath25 and  @xmath26 on the sides of  @xmath54 are given .",

    "to prove convergence of our random walk to an rbm , it is therefore sufficient to show that there are two angles @xmath25 and  @xmath26 such that if  @xmath151 is a function as described above , then for all @xmath152 @xmath153 \\geq 0 .",

    "note that the conditioning in the submartingale property is taken care of because the starting point  @xmath93 is arbitrary .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to verify  ( [ equ : submartingale ] ) up to the stopping time @xmath157 for some large number  @xmath158 .",
    "we will make use of this to have uniform bounds on the error terms in our discrete approximation .",
    "we now show  ( [ equ : submartingale ] ) .",
    "let  @xmath151 be a function in  @xmath146 , and write @xmath159 for the jump times of  @xmath3 .",

    "lemma  [ lem : localtime ] shows that when the starting point of the walk is  @xmath17 , the expected local time spent on the boundary vertices up to time  @xmath9 is of order  @xmath177 .",
    "then one can use the markov property to see that this is enough for us to ignore the @xmath168 term in the limit .",

    "more precisely , the integers @xmath191 and  @xmath190 are defined such that @xmath192 and @xmath193 ( for an illustration , see figure  [ fig : extravertices ] ) .",
    "conversely , given two integers @xmath191 and  @xmath190 and the lattice  @xmath48 , the vertices @xmath186 and  @xmath187 are fixed by these equations .",
    "observe that @xmath191 and  @xmath190 must satisfy @xmath194 to make sure that @xmath187 lies to the right of  @xmath186 .",
    "figure  [ fig : extravertices ] shows the wedges one obtains for different choices of @xmath191 and  @xmath190 on a given lattice .",
    "the main claim of this subsection is that for any choice of the angles @xmath19 and  @xmath20 , there is a choice of integers @xmath195 and of the lattice angles @xmath87 such that the wedge one obtains as described above coincides with the wedge  @xmath13 .",
    "this results is a direct consequence of lemma  [ lem : geometry ] below .",
    "the proof of the lemma , which will give explicit formulas for @xmath195 and @xmath196 in terms of the angles @xmath19 and  @xmath20 , is postponed to the end of this subsection .",
    "[ lem : geometry ] let @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "then there is a choice of ( possibly negative ) integers @xmath191 and  @xmath190 with @xmath197 , and angles @xmath198 $ ] with @xmath47 , such that @xmath199    we remind the reader that in section  [ sec : restricted ] we considered a random walk on a wedge with angles @xmath183 $ ] such that @xmath200 .",
    "the situation described there corresponds to the special choice of @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 in lemma  [ lem : geometry ] .",
    "thus , the random walk construction of section  [ sec : restricted ] is a special case of the more general construction we are considering in this section .",
    "we would also like to remark at this point that the choice of @xmath195 and @xmath87 in lemma  [ lem : geometry ] is not unique in general .",
    "for instance , we will see in the proof of lemma  [ lem : geometry ] that it is always possible to choose the angles @xmath87 in the range @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "thus , there are angles @xmath88 such that the choices made in the proof of the lemma and in the construction of section  [ sec : restricted ] are different .    from now on",
    ", we will assume that the values of @xmath45 and  @xmath46 are fixed as in lemma  [ lem : geometry ] , so that the lattice @xmath90 is fixed .",
    "as we explained above , the lattice provides a nice covering of the wedge  @xmath83 .",
    "following the conventions introduced in section  [ sec : restricted ] , we shall denote by  @xmath89 the set of vertices obtained by taking the intersection of  @xmath205 with  @xmath91 .",
    "we again subdivide the set  @xmath92 into the _ apex _ , _ interior vertices _ and _ left _ and _ right boundary vertices_. we now conclude this subsection with the proof of lemma  [ lem : geometry ] .",
    "assume first that both @xmath19 and  @xmath20 are smaller than  @xmath206",
    ". then we can take @xmath207 and solve equations ( [ equ : alpha ] ) and  ( [ equ : beta ] ) for @xmath45 and  @xmath46 to obtain @xmath208 observe that since @xmath209 and @xmath210 , the angles @xmath45 and  @xmath46 are in the range  @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "it remains to consider the case when either @xmath19 or  @xmath20 is at least  @xmath211 , and by symmetry it suffices to assume @xmath212 .",
    "then , we can for instance set @xmath213 , and let  @xmath214 be the smallest positive integer such that @xmath215 .",
    "we then set @xmath216 and the angles @xmath45 and  @xmath46 are given by the equations ( [ equ : phi ] ) and  ( [ equ : psi ] ) as before . from the inequalities @xmath217 plus the fact that @xmath218 , it follows that @xmath45 and  @xmath46 are in the range  @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "now that we have chosen the lattice on the wedge  @xmath54 , the next task is to define a random walk  @xmath143 on  @xmath92 whose scaling limit is reflected brownian motion . as in section  [ ssec : wedge ] , we will focus on the special case of the uniform walk , i.e. , the random walk on the lattice that stays uniform on the rows all the time .",
    "earlier we explained how one defines this random walk in the case @xmath201 . in this subsection",
    "we will describe what one has to do to generalize to other wedges , i.e. , to the case where @xmath191 or  @xmath190 or both are nonzero . in the following subsection we will then spell out the transition probabilities of the uniform walk for this general case .",
    "it is clear that we should define the transition probabilities from the interior vertices in the same way as before .",
    "this will guarantee that the random walk will converge to brownian motion in the interior of the wedge .",
    "the nontrivial task is to define the transition probabilities from the boundary vertices and at the top of the wedge .",
    "once these are defined , we will use the strategy of section  [ ssec : scalinglimit ] to identify the scaling limit as a reflected brownian motion .",
    "let us therefore reconsider the arguments used there to identify the scaling limit , to see if they still apply to general wedges .",
    "looking back at section  [ ssec : scalinglimit ] we see that it is still sufficient to verify equation  ( [ equ : submartingale ] ) for appropriate functions  @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , equation  ( [ equ : braces ] ) is still valid after making a taylor expansion .",
    "however , we emphasize that in the previous section the sum over the boundary vertices picked up contributions from only one left boundary vertex and one right boundary vertex on every row of the lattice .",
    "this is no longer the case in the general situation , as we shall now discuss .",
    "remember that the boundary vertices are defined as those vertices having less than six nearest - neighbours in  @xmath92 .",
    "now consult figure  [ fig : extravertices ] .",
    "then we see that for a given value of  @xmath191 , the number of left boundary vertices on each row of the lattice is fixed and equals @xmath219 .",
    "likewise , for given  @xmath190 the number of right boundary vertices on every row is @xmath220 .",
    "( an observant reader will notice that if @xmath191 or  @xmath190 is negative , then on the first few rows of the lattice the number of boundary vertices is less than  @xmath221 .",
    "this is a complication that we will deal with later on . )",
    "we conclude that the sum in equation  ( [ equ : braces ] ) picks up  @xmath222 contributions from the left boundary vertices in every row .",
    "each of these contributions is proportional to the derivative of  @xmath151 near the boundary in the direction of @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "we have to guarantee that these contributions add up to something positive if  @xmath151 has positive derivative along some ( yet to be determined ) fixed direction on the left side of the wedge .",
    "to do so , it is clearly sufficient to impose that @xmath98 $ ] is the same at all the left boundary vertices , and this is what we shall do",
    ". the corresponding condition will be imposed at the right boundary vertices .",
    "it is clear from the discussion in section  [ ssec : scalinglimit ] that the scaling limit of the random walk will be a reflected brownian motion .",
    "moreover , the directions of reflection on the two sides of  @xmath54 will be given by the values of @xmath98 $ ] at the left and right boundary vertices .",
    "let us remark that the condition that @xmath98 $ ] is the same at all the boundary vertices may be more than necessary , but by imposing this condition we avoid having to estimate the differences in expected local time at different boundary vertices .    in summary , we will look for transition probabilities from the boundary vertices that satisfy the following conditions :    1 .",
    "the summed transition probability to a given vertex from vertices in the row above is @xmath223 , and likewise from vertices in the row below .",
    "[ conditions ] 2 .",
    "the summed transition probability to a given vertex from vertices in the same row is @xmath127 .",
    "the expected value of the first step of the walk from every left boundary vertex is the same , and likewise for the right boundary vertices .",
    "observe that condition  1 introduces an up - down symmetry which is not inherent in the geometry of the problem , but will be of importance later .",
    "explicit expressions for all the transition probabilities of the uniform walk will be given in the following subsection .",
    "this will show that for any  @xmath195 it is possible to choose the transition probabilities such that they satisfy conditions  13 .    to conclude this subsection , we point out one further complication that we already commented on earlier .",
    "this complication arises when either @xmath191 or  @xmath190 is negative , because then the first few rows of the lattice will contain less than @xmath221 vertices in total .",
    "hence we will have to specify separately the transition probabilities on these first rows of the lattice . as we shall discuss below",
    ", this complication is quite easy to handle .",
    "consider once again figure  [ fig : extravertices ] and recall the definition of the integers @xmath191 and  @xmath190 in section  [ ssec : lattice_gen ] , illustrated in the figure .",
    "then one notes that each row of the lattice contains exactly @xmath224 vertices more than the row above .",
    "in other words , the total number of vertices on row  @xmath106 of the lattice is @xmath225 . from this one",
    "can compute that if either @xmath191 or  @xmath190 is negative , then the first row of the lattice that contains at least all of the @xmath221 boundary vertices is row @xmath226 , where @xmath227 for example , for @xmath228 and  @xmath229 the numbers of left and right boundary vertices are @xmath230 and  @xmath231 , respectively .",
    "however , the first two rows of  @xmath92 contain only @xmath232 and  @xmath233 vertices in total , so that the first row of the lattice that contains at least @xmath221 vertices is row  @xmath234 .",
    "the remaining problem is then to define the transition probabilities from the vertices in the first @xmath226  rows of the lattice .",
    "it is not very difficult to choose the transition probabilities on these first few rows such that the walk will trivially stay uniform on the rows of the lattice .",
    "in fact , we can choose the transition probabilities such that conditions 1 and  2 above are also satisfied at rows @xmath18 up to  @xmath235 , as we shall see below .",
    "this guarantees that the walk does indeed stay uniform on rows",
    ". we can not make condition  3 hold on the first @xmath226  rows .",
    "this is no problem , since this condition was only introduced to prove convergence to reflected brownian motion , as we discussed above , and the local time spent at the first  @xmath226 rows is negligible .      in the previous subsection we described in words how one should define the transition probabilities of the uniform walk in the generic wedge  @xmath236 .",
    "here we shall complete the uniform walk construction by providing explicit expressions for all of the transition probabilities .",
    "we then complete the proof of theorem  [ the : main ] by computing the directions of reflection for the rbm obtained in the scaling limit .",
    "to get us started , given a vertex  @xmath93 of  @xmath92 we set @xmath237 . in the interior of the wedge",
    "we define the transition probabilities as before .",
    "that is , when  @xmath97 is an interior vertex , @xmath238 is to be chosen from the six neighbouring vertices with the probabilities @xmath59 , @xmath60 and  @xmath61 as in figure  [ fig : lattice ] . at the apex , that is , if @xmath239 , the walk moves to either of the vertices on row  @xmath18 of the lattice with probability @xmath240 .",
    "if @xmath191 and  @xmath190 are both nonnegative , then it only remains to specify the transition probabilities from the boundary vertices .",
    "however , when either @xmath191 or  @xmath190 is negative a little more work needs to be done near the top of the wedge , as explained in the previous subsection . in that case",
    ", we recall the definition of row  @xmath226 from the previous subsection . for every @xmath241",
    ", we set the transition probability from each vertex in row  @xmath106 to each vertex in rows  @xmath242 equal to  @xmath243 .",
    "furthermore , for every vertex in row  @xmath106 that have both a left and a right neighbour , the transition probabilities to these two neighbours are equal to  @xmath60 . to the two vertices on row  @xmath106 on the sides of  @xmath54 ( that have only one neighbour ) we assign transition probabilities to the single neighbour and to the vertices themselves equal to  @xmath60 .",
    "this takes care of all the nonzero transition probabilities near the top of the wedge .",
    "it remains to define the transition probabilities from the boundary vertices .",
    "as we explained in the previous subsection , we are looking for transition probabilities that satisfy conditions  13 on page  .",
    "below we shall give explicit expressions for these transition probabilities from the left boundary vertices for arbitrary @xmath244 .",
    "this is in fact sufficient to allow us to derive the transition probabilities for all possible wedges ( i.e.  for all combinations of @xmath191 and  @xmath190 ) , as we shall explain first .",
    "observe that by left - right symmetry we can derive the transition probabilities from the right boundary vertices for any given  @xmath190 , if we know the corresponding transition probabilities from the left boundary vertices for @xmath245 . because the case @xmath246 was already covered in section  [ ssec : wedge ] , it only remains to show that one can obtain the transition probabilities from the left boundary vertices for negative  @xmath191 from those for positive  @xmath191 .",
    "to do so , observe from figure  [ fig : extravertices ] that the left side of a wedge  @xmath54 with given @xmath247 coincides with the right side of a ( different ) wedge  @xmath248 with @xmath249 .",

    "we exploit the up - down symmetry inherent in condition  1 on page  .",
    "it follows that it is indeed sufficient to provide the transition probabilities from the left boundary vertices for positive  @xmath191 only .",
