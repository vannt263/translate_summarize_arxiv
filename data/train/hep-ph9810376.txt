    "<S> it is also demonstrated that the near threshold @xmath2 reaction is a practical reaction to measure isospin breaking in the @xmath1 system , which was first predicted by weinberg about 20 years ago but has never been experimentally tested .    since the discovery of a large mass difference between the up and down quarks ( @xmath3 ) there has been considerable interest in the possibility of observing dynamical isospin breaking in the pion - nucleon system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical consensus is that the magnitude of isospin breaking is not @xmath4 , but instead is @xmath5 @xcite , where @xmath6 0.2 gev . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> it will be shown for the first time that the @xmath7 reaction is an excellent candidate to measure dynamic isospin violations due to the up , down quark mass difference .    </S>",
    "<S> weinberg first showed that there is an isospin violating effect in the s wave @xmath1 scattering length @xmath8 due to the up , down quark mass difference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this predicted effect , which occurs for @xmath9 scattering or charge exchange but not for @xmath10 scattering , has more recently been calculated by chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted magnitude of this effect is the same ( to within a factor of @xmath11 in @xmath12 scattering and charge exchange reactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the magnitude of @xmath13 is small , the relative magnitude of the isospin violating term is @xmath14 30 % @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , for charge exchange where the isospin conserving amplitude is larger , the relative isospin violation is estimated to be @xmath14 2 to 3 % @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the ( dynamic ) isospin breaking effect of the up and down quark mass difference is shown to be present in the near threshold @xmath15 n @xmath16n reaction . </S>",

    "<S> the magnitude of this unitary cusp is due to the large ratio of the electric dipole multipole amplitudes , @xmath22 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first derivations of the unitary cusp @xcite used a k matrix approach to calculate the effect of charge exchange in the final state . due to their single scattering approximation , these calculations violate unitarity as will be discussed below . the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) </S>",
    "<S> calculations are basically isospin conserving but the biggest isospin non - conserving effect due to the pion mass difference ( which is almost purely electromagnetic in origin ) is inserted by hand @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations also violate unitarity due to their truncation at the one loop ( single rescattering ) level . </S>",
    "<S> there has been recent progress in performing chpt calculations in @xmath1 scattering which take the isospin violations due to the coulomb interaction into account @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the approximations made in the k matrix @xcite and published chpt papers @xcite can be overcome by using a 3 channel s matrix approach in which unitarity and time reversal invariance are satisfied ( a preliminary version of this work has been presented previously @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this has the advantage that both static and dynamic isospin breaking , and final state multiple scattering ( to all orders ) , are taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the s matrix for the 3 open channels @xmath23 can be written as :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 represent elastic @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath20 scattering with phase shifts @xmath28 , and @xmath29 respectively , @xmath30 represents the @xmath31 charge exchange amplitude , @xmath32 is a real number , and @xmath33 represents the inelasticity due to charge exchange . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> the off diagonal matrix elements for the photo - production of the @xmath27 and @xmath20 channels are written as @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are proportional to the multipole amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> for the important case of production of s wave pions these are the @xmath38 transverse ( longitudinal ) multipoles . although not explicitly written here , the s matrix elements are for a fixed value of w , the total cm energy , and the quantum numbers l and j , the @xmath39 orbital and total angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the notation of using 0 ( c ) for the neutral ( charged ) channel is conveniently generalized to neutron targets where the three channels are @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .    </S>",

    "<S> these equations show the connection between electromagnetic pion production and @xmath1 interactions . </S>",
    "<S> note that the phase shifts @xmath28 , and @xmath29 appear as @xmath51 in photopion reactions compared to @xmath52 in elastic scattering because the @xmath53 interactions take place in the final ( initial ) state only . </S>",

    "<S> have been neglected with the exception of @xmath58 which is small compared to both @xmath59 and @xmath29 ( except at the @xmath60 threshold ) , and the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions which is put in by hand . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest @xmath61 effect found in @xmath1 scattering @xcite and in photoproduction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the @xmath61 terms have been worked out , although not presented here . in general </S>",
    "<S> they produce a small coupling between the electromagnetic and @xmath1 sectors , so that e.g. the 2x2 @xmath1 sector of the s matrix is no longer separately unitary . </S>",
    "<S> when the experimental situation reaches a sufficient level of accuracy these corrections should then be implemented .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq2 ] is a generalization of the final state interaction theorem of fermi and watson @xcite who first pointed out the connection between photo - pion production and @xmath1 scattering . in their derivation , as in this one , time reversal and unitarity ( to order @xmath56 ) </S>",
    "<S> were assumed . </S>",
    "<S> however they made the additional assumption that if one could neglect @xmath56 ( and higher order terms ) isospin would be conserved ( this was before the time of quarks ) . </S>",
    "<S> this reduces the dimensionality of the s matrix to 2x2 which gives the simple solution @xmath62 where i=1/2,3/2 is the isospin of the @xmath1 system . </S>",
    "<S> if isospin were conserved , so that the two thresholds are degenerate , eq .  </S>",

    "<S> however isospin conservation is badly violated in the threshold region due to the threshold energy difference between the @xmath67 and @xmath68 channels and the additional dynamic isospin violating effect due to the up and down quark mass difference . </S>",
    "<S> this generalization of the fermi - watson theorem removes the approximation of isospin conservation . </S>",
    "<S> note the interesting feature that below the @xmath20 threshold there are only two open channels and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq2 ] reduces to the form of the fermi - watson theorem , i.e. @xmath36 = real number @xmath69 or , equivalently , that @xmath70 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is of interest to show the connection between the s matrix formulation which takes the final state scattering into account to all orders and the original k matrix derivations @xcite which only took a single final state scattering into account . </S>",
    "<S> this single scattering limit can be taken by expanding @xmath71 , and neglecting second order terms like @xmath72 , thus obtaining @xmath73 . by examing the region below the @xmath20 threshold where @xmath74 is continued as @xmath75 </S>",
    "<S> , it is observed that @xmath76 this means that the single scattering approximation does not obey unitarity , although in this particular case the numerical effects are not large . </S>",
    "<S> the chpt calculations to one loop have a similar unitarity problem as was discussed by the chpt authors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the connection between @xmath77 to the multipole amplitudes @xmath78 is @xmath79 . </S>",

    "<S> [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] lead to a unitary cusp . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath85 , and @xmath86 for the transverse multipole , or @xmath87 for the longitudinal multipole . </S>",
    "<S> below the @xmath20 threshold @xmath74 is continued as @xmath88 . </S>",

    "<S> the magnitude of the unitary cusp , @xmath91 , is defined as the coefficient of @xmath74 :    @xmath92    the value of @xmath91 can be calculated from the experimental value of @xmath93 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming isospin is conserved @xmath94 @xcite . for @xmath95 </S>",

    "<S> combining the two experimental ( theoretical ) numbers gives @xmath98 @xmath99 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although it has not been previously noticed , the same physical mechanism that causes the isospin breaking in @xmath1 scattering and charge exchange also enters into @xmath91 . </S>",
    "<S> this follows from unitarity and time reversal ( eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq2 ] and [ eq3 ] ) , combined with the prediction of isospin breaking for the s wave scattering lengths for charge exchange reactions @xmath100 , that there is an isospin violating contribution to @xmath91 ,    @xmath101    in the second line it has been assumed that there is no quark mass effect on @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> it is estimated that @xmath103 2 to 3% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a better theoretical calculation of this effect should be performed .    the electric dipole amplitude @xmath104 with its unitary cusp is presented in figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the recent mainz / taps @xcite and saskatoon @xcite results for @xmath105 are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , where only the statistical errors are shown . </S>",
    "<S> the small deviations between the data sets suggest the magnitude of the systematic errors . considering this </S>",
    "<S> , the agreement between the calculated curves and the data is satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are the chpt calculation with three empirical low energy parameters used in fitting the data @xcite , and a unitary fit to the data @xcite using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq3 ] which has @xmath106 @xcite and a linear function of photon energy for @xmath107 with two parameters which were fit to the data . for this case @xmath108 </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and the effect of the two step charge exchange reaction is dramatic in the real ( imaginary ) part below(above ) the @xmath20 threshold . </S>",
    "<S> approximately 1 mev above the @xmath20 threshold the @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> the negative sign in @xmath110 makes @xmath111 have the opposite sign from @xmath112 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that both the power counting rules of chpt and the constraints of unitarity lead to pion rescattering in the final state as a critical dynamical ingredient . </S>",
    "<S> although the unitary and chpt curves both agree with the data for @xmath105 there is an important difference between them . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath91 = 2.78 @xcite calculated for the @xmath17 reaction is smaller then the one calculated using the separately predicted values of @xmath113 and @xmath114 of @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can be clearly seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this discrepancy , which was discussed by the chpt authors @xcite , is due to the fact that the chpt calculation is carried out to one loop which is not sufficient for @xmath111 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a general feature of chiral perturbation theory in which the imaginary part of the amplitude is not calculated as accurately as the real part , and thus unitarity is only approximately satisfied at a given order @xcite . as will be discussed below the difference between the unitary and one loop chpt values of @xmath91 </S>",
    "<S> can be observed in future experiments in which @xmath111 will be measured directly .    to accurately measure the magnitude of the unitary cusp and to exploit the connection between electromagnetic pion production and low energy @xmath1 interactions </S>",
    "<S> , one must measure @xmath111 . in photoproduction </S>",
    "<S> this requires experiments with polarized beams and/or targets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of brevity the formulas connecting the cross sections and polarization observables to the multipoles @xcite will not be quoted here . to briefly demonstrate the power of polarized photo - pion experiments , </S>",
    "<S> two asymmetries are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] : @xmath116 for linearly polarized photons with an unpolarized target ; and t for unpolarized photons but with a target polarized normal to the reaction plane . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in fig .  [ fig3 ] use the p wave predictions of chiral perturbation theory @xcite and the unitary fit to @xmath117 discussed above @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath116 is primarily sensitive to the p wave multipoles and since the unitary fit has essentially the same p wave multipoles as chpt , the curves for chpt and the unitary fit are almost identical . by contrast , t is sensitive to a linear combination of p wave multipoles times @xmath111 , and shows its rapid rise above the @xmath20 threshold . for t , </S>",
    "<S> the large difference in @xmath111 between the unitary fit @xcite and chpt to one loop @xcite should be straightforward to distinguish experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> a proposed experiment with tagged photons using an active , polarized proton target at mainz estimates that @xmath91 can be measured to @xmath118 to 2% @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results could be obtained using a laser backscattering source @xcite or small angle electron scattering with polarized , internal , targets in a storage ring facility @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several possible strategies to test isospin conservation from measurements in the near threshold @xmath119 reaction . </S>",
    "<S> a definitive demonstration of this effect would involve precision measurements of the real and imaginary parts of @xmath117 for the unitary cusp contributions to the @xmath120 and @xmath17 reactions . </S>",
    "<S> although the predicted effect of @xmath14 2 to 3% in @xmath91 is larger than the usual @xmath141% effect expected on the basis of electromagnetic effects , it represents a serious experimental challenge to accomplish this goal , particularly since free neutron targets are not available to make this measurement . a simpler strategy would be to perform a precision measurement of the unitary cusp for the @xmath121 reaction , extract the value of @xmath91 , and compare the result of with the value obtained using unitarity and isospin conservation quoted above . </S>",
    "<S> an equivalent strategy is to obtain @xmath122 from the measured value of @xmath91 and compare it to the accurately measured value of @xmath123 @xcite , obtained from the width of the 1s state in pionic hydrogen , to see if there is any deviation from the pure isospin prediction that these values are equal and opposite @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that there is a psi proposal @xcite to improve the pionic hydrogen measurement so that the error in @xmath123 will be reduced to @xmath14 1% .    </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of interest to discuss the information that might be obtained from measurements of the s wave @xmath1 scattering lengths , @xmath8 , from photopion reactions with the values that have been obtained using conventional pion beams . </S>",
    "<S> the values for @xmath8 for several physical channels are presented in table  [ tab1 ] ( the appropriate isospin relations @xcite were used when required ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most accurate and direct measurements come from pionic hydrogen experiments @xcite . in order to test isospin symmetry </S>",
    "<S> the psi group has also measured pionic deuterium in order to get at the @xmath124 scattering length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately the two body corrections in deuterium are large and add significantly to the error which makes the isospin conservation test uncertain at the required level of accuracy , so that these values are not quoted here . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the two most recent empirical analyses of the @xmath1 data for pion kinetic energies greater than @xmath14 30 mev , extrapolated to threshold , are also presented @xcite in table  [ tab1 ] . in the said study </S>",
    "<S> the scattering lengths come from a dispersive analysis , the errors are hard to ascertain and are not quoted @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral perturbation theory results @xcite are consistent with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> if isospin symmetry is exact there are two independent scattering lengths in the i = 1/2 , 3/2 states , and six possible physical @xmath125n elastic scattering and charge exchange reactions , so that there are many possible tests if three or more channels can be measured precisely . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the gap that can be filled by measurement of the final state @xmath125n interactions in photopion production , e.g. @xmath27 or @xmath126 in the @xmath127 reaction .    </S>",
    "<S> .s - wave @xmath1 scattering lengths @xmath8 for several channels in units of @xmath128 ( n = n or p ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another test of isospin conservation has been made for medium energy @xmath125n scattering ( pion kinetic energy from 30 to 100 mev ) @xcite . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> the scattering amplitudes in the i = 1/2 and 3/2 states were obtained from the data for @xmath129 elastic scattering . from these , the prediction for the @xmath130 charge exchange amplitude made on the assumption of isospin conservation was compared to the empirical charge exchange amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> an isospin violation at the @xmath131 level has been found by both analyses @xcite , primarily in the s wave amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> these analyses depend on the quality of the data and on the accuracy of the coulomb corrections , which have been criticized as being inconsistent with the strong interaction calculations that were employed @xcite . if isospin is indeed violated at the 7% level , it is not clear how to relate this to the isospin breaking predictions for the s wave scattering length @xcite which is applicable at lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> what is required is an extension of the isospin breaking calculations to medium energies . </S>",
    "<S> a test of the existing predictions requires experiments at lower energies which would measure the s wave scattering lengths .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the measurement of @xmath111 above the @xmath20 threshold discussed above , one could contemplate the more difficult measurement when only the @xmath27 channel is open . as was discussed previously , from a measurement of both the @xmath132 and @xmath133 parts of @xmath117 ( or @xmath134 ) one obtains @xmath59 , for which there is a predicted @xmath135 isospin breaking effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , because of the small expected size of @xmath136 in the energy region below the @xmath20 threshold , this is a very difficult task . </S>",
    "<S> it may be at the limits of feasibility using either a laser backscattering source , where an intense photon flux is concentrated in a small energy interval @xcite , or with internal target , small angle scattering with polarized internal targets @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the connection between the @xmath137 reaction and @xmath138 scattering has been presented in a rigorous , model - independent way , which is unitary and time reversal invariant , and where the isospin breaking due to the threshold difference between the @xmath68 and @xmath67 channels , and the mass difference between the up and down quarks , is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a predicted unitary cusp due to the two step @xmath139 charge exchange reaction . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the unitary cusp is given by @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> this unitary cusp has been recently observed in photoproduction experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown for the first time that there is a dynamical isospin breaking effect in the value of @xmath91 , due to the mass difference of the up and down quarks , in electromagnetic pion production . </S>",
    "<S> this is linked by unitarity and time reversal invariance to a predicted quark mass effect in @xmath141 scattering and pion charge exchange @xcite . at present </S>",
    "<S> there are accurate measurements for @xmath142 and @xmath143 from pionic atoms performed at psi @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> to check isospin conservation requires at least one more precision measurement in another charge channel . </S>",
    "<S> this is more readily performed in electromagnetic meson production for two reasons : 1 ) in order to accurately measure the s wave scattering length , it is important to work at very low energies ( e.g. @xmath144 10 mev ) at which @xmath1 experiments are hard to perform since the low energy charged pions decay and also since @xmath60 beams can not be made at any energy ; and 2 ) in electromagnetic pion production one can access charge states that can not be reached with conventional pion beams ( this is important for isospin checks ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that photoproduction experiments with polarized targets can lead to a precise measurement of the small but interesting isospin violating effects . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the polarization observables in photoproduction discussed above , similar information can be obtained in threshold @xmath60 electroproduction from the combination of the transverse- longitudinal ( tl and tl ) structure functions @xcite . this possibility will be discussed in a future publication . finally we stress that the important program of precisely measuring the @xmath1 and photopion reactions that are required to test the predicted isospin violation , is difficult but feasible . </S>"
