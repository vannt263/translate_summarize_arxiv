    "nowadays the lagrangian kinematics description for finite element method of geometric nonlinear structures is utilized mainly in two solution techniques , i.e. total lagrangian formulation and updated lagrangian formulation . in this paper",
    "we investigate a less common solution technique for geometrically nonlinear problems , i.e. the lagrange co - rotational ( cr ) formulation .",
    "key features of the lagrange cr formulation are efficiency and robustness , i.e. computation of tangent matrices is is low - priced , the method is easy to parallelize and can be used with various discretization techniques .",
    "large class of problems with finite rotations but small strains , e.g. post - buckling stability analysis , damage and fracture mechanics , modelling of dynamic fragmentation of bodies made from quasi - brittle materials , solid fluid interaction , analysis of post - stressed structures or discreet body dynamics can be solved efficiently with the use of co - rotational formulation .",
    "as noted above , the lagrange cr formulation can be applied together with discretization techniques not suitable for total lagrangian formulation or updated lagrangian formulation . in this paper",

    "application of the cr formulation together with hts elements results in a powerful synergy , which is exemplified on a case study problem presented in the paper .",
    "although the presented methodology is applied to problems of solid mechanics , the presentede method can be applied to image recovery , where extraction of rigid body motion from image is an issue .",

    ". full literature review can be fond in @xcite . despite the large body of literature on co - rotational formulations , formulation of a best fit rotation functional",

    "we apply it to a particular instance of the hybrid trefftz stress elements . in authors view combination of the hts element with the cr formulation is a good example of the robustness of the co - rotational approach : we apply the cr formulation to a discontinuous displacement approximation , exclusively determined only on element boundary . moreover , unlike for the classical displacement finite element method , the employed displacement approximation does represent a partition of unity .          in the spirit of hybrid fe formulations ,",

    "the stress field and the associated displacement field are derived from appropriate trefftz functions .",
    "for example , the stress and displacement field could be given as polynomial functions derived from the airy s stress function .",
    "alternatively , the trefftz functions can be extended to functions which can take into account singularities or are suitable for a particular boundary value problem .",

    "following the solution of the displacement degrees of freedom , the stress degrees of freedom can be recovered on an element by element basis , a process that can be easily parallelized .",
    "it is noted , that independent displacement approximation on elements faces , as presented here , lead to larger number of unknowns in comparison to classical fem .",
    "nevertheless , the matrix sparsity , which has a significant impact on the efficiency of direct and iterative solvers , is minimised in the presented approach due to the association of the displacement degrees of freedom with faces rather than vertices and due to the fact that any given face can only have two neighbouring elements in either 2d or 3d .",

    "we note that the change of the rotation angle is a source of nonlinearities and a direct control of the rotation angle positively affects the stability of the newton method .",
