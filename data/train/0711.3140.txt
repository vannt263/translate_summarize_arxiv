    "we conclude that spatial variations in interstellar absorption are mostly responsible for the large range in x - ray colors seen in figure [ colorxray ] .",

    "this is clearly an unreasonably short shock age for a 3000 yr old snr .",
    "problems arise also if low ( @xmath36 @xmath21 ) electron densities are assumed , as such low - density gas with lmc abundances is too faint in x - rays .",

    "these severe difficulties suggest that the alternative explanation of strong o lines in terms of o - rich ejecta is the correct one . the determination of plasma conditions and abundances within the ejecta would require a separate , detailed spectroscopic analysis involving a superposition of heavy - element ejecta and blast wave emission .",
