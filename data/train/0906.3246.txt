    "differential equations with delayed in advanced arguments occur in many applied problems , see @xcite , especially in mathematical economics .",
    "there are natural delays in impact and processing in the economic models , like the policy lags @xcite .",
    "government s stabilization policy can be destabilizing due to delays in policy response @xcite ( if the delays are large enough ) .",
    "an advanced term may , for example , reflect the dependency on anticipated capital stock @xcite .",
    "however , apart from the case of constant coefficients , there are only few results on delayed - advanced ( mixed ) differential equations .",
    "the present paper partially fills up this gap .",
    "it mainly deals with non - oscillation problems : we obtain criteria when a nonoscillatory solution with a prescribed tendency ( either nonincreasing or nondecreasing ) exists .",
    "recently results on oscillation of delay differential equations ( dde ) have taken shape of a developed theory presented in monographs @xcite-@xcite .",
    "most of oscillation criteria for dde can be extended to equations of advanced type ( ade ) ( see @xcite-@xcite and also the recent papers @xcite-@xcite ) . however , for mixed differential equations ( mde ) , i.e. , equations with delay and advanced arguments , the theory is much less developed .    in this paper",
    "we consider a mixed differential equation @xmath2 with variable coefficients @xmath3 , one delayed ( @xmath4 ) and one advanced ( @xmath5 ) arguments . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "oscillation of such equations has not been studied before , except partial cases of autonomous equations @xcite-@xcite , equations of the second or higher order @xcite-@xcite and equations with constant delays @xcite . in @xcite nonoscillation only of equation ( [ 1ab ] ) and higher order equations was considered , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 have the same sign . in @xcite",
    "the author considers a differential equation with a deviating argument without the assumption that it is either a delay or an advanced equation .",
    "hence the results of @xcite can be applied to mde ( [ 1ab ] ) .",
    "the results of the present paper and of @xcite are independent .",
    "we consider equation ( [ 1ab ] ) under the following conditions :    ( a1 ) @xmath8 are lebesgue measurable locally essentially bounded functions , + @xmath9 @xmath10    ( a2 ) @xmath11 .    for equation ( [ 1ab ] ) we can consider the same initial value problem as for delay equations : @xmath12    * definition .",

    "we consider the two remaining cases where coefficients have different signs : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "for these cases we obtain some rather natural explicit nonoscillation conditions for equation ( [ 1ab ] ) : in section 2 for the former case , in section 3 for the latter one .",
    "finally , section 4 involves discussion of the results and outlines some open problems on mde .",
