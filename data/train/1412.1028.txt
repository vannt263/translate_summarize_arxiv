    "hawking famously showed @xcite that black holes emit a stationary thermal flux with temperature @xmath0 which is perceived by the asymptotic observers at late - times .",
    "but that is not all that happens in the system that undergoes a gravitational collapse .",
    "for example , in a typical collapse scenario ( see fig .",
    "[ penrosecol ] ( left ) ) , the usual hawking effect is understood due to the ` peeling ' of modes that travel close to the horizon just before the collapse and escape to infinity with an infinite redshift .",
    "this is depicted by ray number @xmath1 and the corresponding static observer encounters a temperature with the standard tolman shift which becomes unity in the asymptotic limit .",
    "however , we can have a similar null ray numbered @xmath2 here , which would be just inside the horizon and hits the singularity at some finite time . the infallers",
    "( radial or otherwise ) would encounter this situation .",
    "the third possibility is of the ray @xmath3 that is inside the collapsing star all the time and here we would have comoving observers ( the inside spacetime being friedmann for dust collapse ) .",
    "thus , we can have many different observers / frames which _ should _ see the effect of collapse on the quantum vacuum differently and there is a rich structure beneath waiting to be explored .    on a related note , a class of observers termed the _",
    "infallers _ have recently sprung a hot debate in the community on what would happen _ at the horizon crossing _",
    " la the hawking effect .",
    "it is usually argued @xcite on the basis of equivalence principle that the infalling observer should see a quantum vacuum state while crossing the horizon and nothing special .",
    "however , this line of thought has been questioned lately by amps @xcite claiming on the quantum - information - theoretic grounds that the infalling observers will encounter a _ firewall _ at the horizon . amidst these speculations which are not completely understood at this time",
    ", we seek to know what happens at least _ semi - classically _ , relying on the well - established grounds .",

    "they found that the effective temperature increases for a detector dropped from infinity on a radially infalling geodesic as the infall progresses and reaches the temperature _ four _ times the hawking temperature at the horizon .",
    "as much as this result is intriguing , it should be noted their analysis does not give any direct link with the detector response nor does it provide any understanding to how thermal or non - thermal the effect is .",
    "another point of concern is the choice of vacuum which they choose to be some new unconventional state in extended schwarzchild geometry .",
    "we might think the peculiar result could be an artefact of this contraption .",
    "but more importantly , the use of both the ingoing and outgoing eddington - finkelstein coordinates together is not suitable if we wish to study the interior of the black hole horizon .    with this retrospection of the cards on the table",
    ", we now proceed to bring in a new deck @xcite with the following assumptions and characteristics : ( a ) we introduce a new set of globally defined coordinates which are regular everywhere .",

    "( c ) we define and study a suitably defined time - dependent ` temperature ' function also relating it explicitly to udw response functions by an _ adiabatic expansion _ and finally ( d ) we look at the observables  energy density and fluxes  built from the renormalized stress energy tensor ( rset ) which explicitly depend on observer s kinematics for an alternate description .",
    "this also confirms the results of the effective temperature approach .",
    "this paper is meant to give a concise description of the formalism and results obtained in the previous works @xcite which relate with the collapse of a thin null shell ( ingoing vaidya geometry ) and to provide a preview of the results ( relating to time - like dust collapse ) which are a work in progress @xcite .",
    "without further ado , we shall present the new procedure and its application to the thin null shell collapse . as remarked earlier , it begins with the introduction of the _ new _ coordinates .    *",

    "this construction is completely general and valid for any type of collapse . for the vaidya collapse where the thin null shell lies at @xmath7 separating the inside minkowski from the schwarzchild exterior ,",
    "this coordinatization can be computed ( by ray tracing ) in terms of the eddington - finkelstein ingoing coordinates to give @xmath8 and @xmath9\\quad\\quad\\textrm{for}\\ v\\geq0 , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the lambert @xmath12-function .",
    "the metric in these coordinates is given ( with @xmath13 ) by , [ nullmetric ] * * field setup : * the minimally coupled massless scalar field in the @xmath14-wave approximation at @xmath4 is given by ~_r , that is , superposition of two spherical waves one impinging directly and one that comes after a reflection from @xmath15 .",
    "this also gives the interpretation to the coordinates @xmath5 as being tied to the eikonal approximation .",
    "* * detector response : * the response of a detector @xcite moving on a general trajectory @xmath16 can be written as ( ) = 2_0^ds e^-is g((),(-s ) ) where the wightmann function , @xmath17 takes the logarithmic form @xcite , [ 2d ] g(x , y)((v_+(x)-v_+(y)-i0)(v_-(x)-v_-(y)-i0 ) ) for @xmath14-waves .",
    "this splits the response into two : @xmath18 decoupling the ingoing and outgoing modes giving _ two temperatures _ ! the response function in its generality is difficult to compute analytically .",
    "however , if @xmath19 is any solution of the differential equation , ( ) = -k ( ) ( ) with @xmath20 as the slowly varying function , then we can consider the adiabatic expansion of the response functional , which gives , @xmath21 = \\f{2\\pi}{\\omega(e^{\\omega / t}-1)}\\big(\\,1\\,+\\ ,   \\f{\\dot{t}(\\tau)}{t(\\tau)^{2}}\\f{\\omega}{8\\pi t(\\tau)}\\f{e^{\\omega/2t(\\tau)}}{\\sinh^{2}(\\omega/2t(\\tau))}+\\cdots\\big).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is , all observers , asymptotic or non - asymptotic will perceive a _ quasi - thermal _ spectrum at t_=|| which is related to the ` peeling ' condition .",

    "* * energy density and fluxes : * for an alternate prescription , we can compute the rset of the quantum field in @xmath24 dimensions from @xmath25 for @xmath14-waves , the @xmath26 dimensional counterpart is usually considered @xcite by multiplying the above expressions with the inverse square distance @xmath27 .",
    "given the velocity of the observer @xmath28 and a vector @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , we can construct two local invariant observables _ energy density _ and _ flux _ as @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively and which depend explicitly on the observer s kinematics .",

    "with the above procedure , the usual hawking effect for an asymptotic observer at rest relative to the hole can be recovered as follows .",
    "for this observer , @xmath38 satisfies -=and subsequently v^-()-v^-(-s)e^-(-s)/2(s/2 ) which recovers _ thermal spectrum _ at @xmath39 [ thermalspectrum ] _",
    "while @xmath40 in this case . for a non - asymptotic static observer at some finite radius @xmath41 from the hole ,",
    "the temperature gets scaled by the redshift factor , @xmath42 .",
    "while many other trajectories can be considered , we shall look at the results for the radially infalling observer characterized by energy per unit rest mass , @xmath43 or the initial radius from where the infall begins , @xmath44 .",
    "the analysis of the effective temperatures here then shows a dependence on @xmath43 and is presented in table  [ radialtemp ] ( these results are also seen to hold in the case of time - like collapse@xcite ) .",
    "the non - stationarity of the regime shows in having two temperatures now .",
    "the temperature @xmath33 presents itself with a doppler shift for @xmath45 and the result in the near - horizon limit matches with ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath46 , i.e. , for the detector dropped in from infinity .",
    "the surprise is that in the near - horizon region @xmath36 ( incoming modes ) dominates over @xmath33 ( outgoing modes ) for @xmath47 ( see fig  [ inoutnearh ] left ) which implies a duality between the asymptotic and the near - horizon observer in that the near - horizon observer sees a dominant and high radiation from the _ sky _ @xcite .",
    "however , it is to be noted that the adiabaticity in these cases is @xmath48 and hence the temperatures can only be interpreted in the uv limit .    from another angle , we can compute the energy density and fluxes for various observers .",
    "for the static observers in the late - time limit , we have , @xmath49 these expressions reduce to the hawking energy density and flux for the asymptotic observers with @xmath50 and otherwise the temperature is given by the tolman blueshift factor .",
    "the _ onset _ of thermality depends on the location of the observer .",
    "it is earlier for the near - horizon observers and late for those away from the horizon .",
    "the flux diverges at the horizon .",
    "the energy density presents a contrast that in the near - horizon region it reaches a maximum positive value , then decreases and becomes negative ( fig .",
    "[ infalluf ] ) .",
    "this corresponds to negative energy fluxes directed into the black hole which have been discussed before ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .     in the near horizon limit which shows dependence on energy and the dominance of ingoing mode ( @xmath36 ) over outgoing ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath51 . *",
    "* we have the flux in the near horizon region confirming the effective temperature results.,title=\"fig : \" ]   in the near horizon limit which shows dependence on energy and the dominance of ingoing mode ( @xmath36 ) over outgoing ( @xmath33 ) for @xmath51 . *",
    "* we have the flux in the near horizon region confirming the effective temperature results.,title=\"fig : \" ]    [ infalluf ]   or @xmath52 here ) and diverge only at the eventual singularity .",
    "for the static observers , as we go near the horizon , the flux diverges at the horizon due to infinite acceleration .",
    "the energy density , however , reaches a maximum and then decrease to become negative and diverges negatively at the horizon.,title=\"fig : \" ]   or @xmath52 here ) and diverge only at the eventual singularity . for the static observers ,",

    "the energy density , however , reaches a maximum and then decrease to become negative and diverges negatively at the horizon.,title=\"fig : \" ]    for the radially infalling observer , the energy density and flux increases ( see fig .",
    "[ infalluf ] ) as the infall occurs and is _ finite _ and _ regular _ at the horizon for the infall beginning far from the horizon and diverges only at the eventual singularity . at the horizon ,",
    "these observables are given by , @xmath53 which show agreement with the effective temperatures such that for @xmath47 , that is , if the infall occurs starts close to the horizon , a high flux is perceived at the horizon crossing ( see fig .",
    "[ inoutnearh ] right ) .    * but why the clicking ?",
    "* we can show by considering artificial black holes which are flat at the horizon , that the effective temperature due to outgoing modes @xmath33 vanishes at the horizon and also the flux contribution corresponding to it .",
    "however , the effect due the ingoing modes remains .",
    "this shows that curvature has something to do with the detector response and the flux .",
    "when the outgoing modes do not feel the curvature at the horizon , we see no effect but the ingoing modes surely encounter some curvature while travelling to the horizon and account for the observed effect . the varying riemann curvature ( as the infall progresses )",
    "gives the clicking at the horizon .",
    "we see that using a new set of tools and procedure unravels some new and surprising results in the age old problem of quantum fields in gravitational collapse . the response of an udw detector can be computed using the adiabatic expansion and",
    "hence we see not one but _ two _ temperatures attributed to ingoing and outgoing modes .",
    "this formalism can be applied to many different trajectories . in particular , we see for the infalling radial observers , in the near - horizon limit , the temperature due to ingoing modes dominates over outgoing modes for _ slowly _ moving detectors .",
    "a look at the energy density and flux confirms this .",
    "so the punchline is that _ if you wish to drop into the black hole , start far off_. also , now we know , at least semi - classically , that there _ is _ clicking at the horizon and we need to dig in further for more insights .",
