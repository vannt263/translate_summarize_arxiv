    "assuming the gravitational field to be weak and the test particles to move slowly , we can give the newtonian limit of our equations .",
    "this reads @xcite : @xmath212 where we assume @xmath213 with @xmath214 very small and @xmath215 to be the minkowski metric . proceeding as in classical mechanics , we find the virial theorem @xmath216 where @xmath217 denotes the temporal average and @xmath218 is the kinetic energy .",
    "hence , the virial theorem does nt change for @xmath219 as compared to the newtonian limit of the standard schwarzschild case @xmath21",
    ". however , note that the kinetic energy @xmath220 has a @xmath2-dependence since @xmath221 since the average of the potential energy @xmath222 does not depend on @xmath2 and the virial theorem holds for all @xmath2 this means that when @xmath223 the angular velocity @xmath224 increases .",
    "we have  in fact  seen this effect when studying the perihelion shift of planets .",
    "for the same interval of eigentime , the planet moves further in a space - time with @xmath223 as compared to in a space - time with @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , it is easy to show that kepler s third law @xmath225 , where @xmath220 is the period of the orbit and @xmath226 the semimajor axis also does nt change .",
    "this is easiest to see when considering circular and planar orbits with @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath44 . for these",
    ", we let @xmath227 and substitute @xmath228 from @xmath229 into @xmath230 ( see ( [ rcompo ] ) and ( [ thetacompo ] ) ) . after separation",
    "the two sides can be integrated to give the period of the orbit .",
    "the relation will contain a dependence on @xmath2 .",
    "however , note that the integration in @xmath0 is from @xmath231 to @xmath232 such that the @xmath2 cancels and @xmath220 and @xmath226 are independent of @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we have constructed the complete set of geodesics in the space - time of a schwarzschild black hole pierced by a cosmic string .",
    "we have classified the geodesics according to their energy , angular momentum aligned with the axis of the string @xmath29 , the ratio between total angular momentum and @xmath29 , the horizon radius of the black hole and the deficit angle ( or energy per unit length of the string ) .",
    "we found that the change of the deficit angle does nt effect the @xmath45 motion , but that the @xmath46 motion changes significantly .",
    "moreover , the motion of the particles is in general not planar .",
    "we found a bound of the energy per unit length of the string comparing our results with experimental tests of general relativity . from perihelion shift and light deflection we found @xmath180 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "the existence of cosmic strings may also influence the creation of gravitational waves since for inspirals and flybys the deficit angle modifies the angular velocity and , thus , the temporal change of the effective quadrupole responsible for the emitted gravitational wave .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can be generalized to rotating black holes , i.e. to the space - time of a kerr black hole pierced by a cosmic string .",
    "they can further be generalized to a schwarzschild  de sitter black hole pierced by a cosmic string .",
    "for treating such orbits one has to apply hyperelliptic integration developed in @xcite .",
    "we expect the same enlarged variety of orbits as we encountered in schwarzschild  de sitter space  time as compared to schwarzschild space  time .",
