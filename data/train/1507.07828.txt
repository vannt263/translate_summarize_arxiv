    "with our perspective of more than a century , the different attempts to construct phase space distributions for quantum phenomena seem a bit surprising . from the very beginning , after the work of de broglie in 1926 @xcite , the big fathers of the quantum theory knew a formulation of quantum phenomena that leads to a true phase space distribution . according to de broglies theory , it is possible to define simultaneously a position and a momentum for an electron .",
    "however , they preferred conscientiously to renounce this _ natural _",
    "path for constructing _ true _ phase space probability distributions .",
    "they looked for alternative ways to build a phase space distribution within the orthodox interpretation .",
    "all _ orthodox _ attempts have inherent difficulties .",
    "for example , the wigner or husimi distribution functions are quasi - probability distributions . the prefix _ quasi _ accounts for such difficulties . in this paper",
    ", we argue that de broglie showed the path for a true phase space quantum distribution .",
    "the beginning of the twentieth century brought surprising non - classical phenomena : max planck s explanation of the black body radiation @xcite , the work of albert einstein on the photoelectric effect @xcite , the niels bohr s model to account for the electron orbits around the nuclei @xcite , etc . in order to provide an explanation for the underlying physics of such new phenomena",
    ", physicists were forced to abandon classical mechanics to develop novel , abstract and imaginative theories and formalisms . + in 1924 , louis de broglie suggested in his doctoral thesis that matter , apart from its intrinsic particle - like behavior , could exhibit also a wave - like one @xcite .",
    "three years later he proposed an interpretation of quantum phenomena based on non - classical trajectories guided by a _ wave field _  @xcite .",
    "this was the origin of the pilot - wave formulation of quantum mechanics that we will refer as bohmian mechanics to account for the following work of david bohm @xcite . in the bohmian formulation ,",
    "an individual quantum system is formed by a point - like particle whose local velocity is defined from a guiding wave .",
    "the concept of an electron trajectory is , therefore , intrinsic to the bohmian theory @xcite and a phase space with well - defined position and momentum becomes a _",
    "natural _ construction .",
    "contemporaneously , max born and werner heisenberg , in the course of their collaboration in copenhagen with niels bohr , provided an original explanation of all quantum phenomena without the need of trajectories @xcite .",
    "this was the origin of the so - called copenhagen interpretation ( also known as the _ orthodox _ formulation ) of quantum phenomena . in the copenhagen interpretation ,",
    "an individual quantum system exhibits its wave or its particle nature depending on the experimental arrangement .",
    "however , it is not possible to retain the concept of trajectory because the theory itself forbids simultaneous definition of position and local velocity for an electron .",
    "therefore , strictly speaking , there is no phase - space in the _ orthodox _ formulation of quantum mechanics .    in spite of these _",
    "orthodox _ difficulties , the scientific community has done a constant effort to effectively develop additional formalisms or theories to define a quantum phase space with position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 .",
    "the first attempt was due to hermann weyl @xcite in 1927 and eugene wigner @xcite in 1932 , who developed the so called wigner - weyl transform between the hilbert space and a new quantum phase space .",
    "the independent works realized by hip groenewold @xcite and joe moyal @xcite lead to a complete formalism where the time evolution of a quantum system itself was defined in phase space alone ( not in the hilbert space ) . for",
    "a proper discussion see also @xcite .",
    "the wigner function is a quasi - probability distribution because it gives negative values at some regions of the phase space . of course",
    ", such negative values do not invalidate the physical contents of the wigner function because it reproduces the correct charge and current densities when properly integrated .",
    "in addition , some relevant works do also give physical explanation to these negative values @xcite . their main argument",
    "is that as far as we can not measure these probabilities , they are a correct and acceptable mathematical tool . at the end of the day ,",
    "only positive probabilities corresponding to measurable observables will be recorded . in 1940",
    ", kodi husimi@xcite developed a non - negative phase - space probability function , the so - called husimi distribution .",
    "however , in spite of being a non - negative phase - space distribution , it is also a quasi - probability distribution because it does not reproduce correctly values of the charge and current densities when integrated .    by construction ,",
    "bohmian mechanics , orthodox quantum mechanics and wigner distribution functions give exactly the same empirical results for all ( non - relativistic ) quantum mechanical phenomena .",
    "therefore , all of them are perfectly valid tools to develop practical solutions for quantum problems .",
    "every formalism has pros and cons .",
    "for example , when dealing with phase space , it is unquestionable that the wigner distribution has had a large practical utility in many quantum problems , even in our days @xcite .",
    "this special issue devoted to the use of the wigner function in the computation of quantum electronics shows its unquestionable success .",
    "therefore , the main goal of this paper is not to criticize the quasi - probability nature of the wigner distribution , but to point out that bohmian mechanics provides an original quantum theory with well - defined phase space .",
    "it is possible to construct a _ true _ distribution of probability in phase space . at the present moment ,",
    "it is not evident if such bohmian distributions can be as useful as the wigner ones , but it seems obvious that this true phase space distribution merits to be investigated .      in classical mechanics ,",
    "a particle has well - defined position @xmath2 and momentum @xmath3 .",
    "then , if we consider a large number @xmath4 of trajectories ( for example , by repeating the same experiment with different initial conditions ) , it is possible to define a classical phase space distribution @xmath5 by counting the number of trajectories at each point @xmath6 of the phase space :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the actual position and momentum of the @xmath10-th particle at time @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "the evolution of this classical phase space distribution can be found by directly solving the newton laws of the @xmath4 trajectories or by solving the boltzmann equation .",
    "+ at this point , we want to clarify that the discussion done in this paper will be focused on one - particle systems .",
    "the function @xmath5 is constructed by repeating the experiment @xmath13 times ( or by dealing simultaneously with @xmath4 independent particles ) .",
    "all conclusions elaborated in this paper about one - particle phase space probability functions can be straightforwardly generalized for many - particle systems , but with a large increment of notation complexity that would later become irrelevant for our conclusions . but @xmath14 . ]",
    "for the same reason , we will consider only one spatial degree of freedom and one momentum degree of freedom for each particle .",
    "the proper definition of the _ phase space _ is not so obvious in quantum mechanics .",
    "first , let us notice that there are several different but _ empirically _ equivalent theories that successfully account for all quantum phenomena . strictly speaking",
    ", there is no phase space in the copenhagen ( _ orthodox _ ) quantum theory .",
    "the local position and local momentum do not exist , simultaneously , in that theory .",
    "let us start by discussing why there is no phase space in the copenhagen ( _ orthodox _ ) quantum theory . according to dirac",
    ", the observables are represented by operators in hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the commutator of these operators specifies which quantities can be known simultaneously and which not @xcite . in the case of the position operator @xmath15 and the momentum operator @xmath16",
    ", we have :    @xmath17|\\psi \\rangle=\\hat{x}\\hat{p}|\\psi\\rangle-\\hat{p}\\hat{x}|\\psi\\rangle = i\\hbar|\\psi\\rangle \\label{commutator}\\ ] ]    therefore the orthodox theory does not support the simultaneous knowledge of local positions and momenta . strictly speaking ,",
    "there is no phase space in the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics . nevertheless , within the orthodox quantum mechanics",
    ", we will see later that the wigner formalism defines a phase space with a well - defined value for the position and the momentum of particles , through the use of the wigner - weyl transform .",
    "let us specify what we understand by a well - defined probability distribution in the phase space , say @xmath18 , for a quantum ( or classical ) system .",
    "one desires that this probability distribution fulfils the probabilities axioms to @xmath19 and thus we will not write them explicitly . ] :    @xmath20    in addition , its marginal distribution should give the usual position or charge probability distributions of an electron in eq .",
    "( [ marg1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) .",
    "we notice also that the words charge or current densities can be misleading when a wave packet is partially transmitted or reflected , and",
    "the charge is in fact either fully transmitted or fully reflected , not both , when measured . ] :    @xmath21    expression ( [ marg1 ] ) is an important quantity in quantum transport because it is related to the charge density , which is a very relevant magnitude in any self - consistent solution of the electron transport .",
    "another important quantity built from this distribution is the current density , which can be expressed as :    @xmath22    several attempts have been done trying to provide such a phase space quantum distribution @xmath18 .",
    "hereafter we report the wigner distribution function @xcite ( which is nothing else but a mathematical wigner - weyl transform of the density matrix ) and the husimi distribution ( a smoothed version of the wigner distribution function ) .",
    "the negative values of the wigner distribution function in some regions of the phase space avoids the possibility of this wigner distribution function to be a true probability function .",
    "the husimi distribution , by construction , has non - negative @xcite values .",
    "however , it does not reproduce correctly the marginal distributions ( [ marg1 ] ) and ( [ current ] ) .",
    "+ if one is interested in a _ true _ probability distribution in phase space , it seems appropriate to use a quantum theory that has a well - defined phase space , i.e. a theory that explicitly accounts for well - defined positions and local momenta @xcite . such theory exist .",

    "the wave - function provides the local velocity of the particle that provides the electron trajectory when properly integrated . in summary ,",
    "bohmian mechanics is a theory which provides a well - defined position and momentum for a particle .",
    "thus , contrarily to the orthodox theory , the bohmian theory allows the existence of a _ physical _ and _ natural _ phase space . by construction ,",
    "such bohmian probability distribution is non - negative and it satisfies all the probability axioms in order to be a correct probability distribution . _",
    "if the scientific community is interested in describing quantum phenomena in phase space , why not using the bohmian distribution function ? _ + after this large introduction , in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] wigner , husimi and bohmian distributions are defined and we compare their properties . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we show numerical results for the phase space of the mentioned distributions when an electron impinges on a double barrier .",
    "we discuss and show numerically some disadvantages of the wigner and husimi distributions , which are not present in the bohmian distribution . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] conclusions are exposed .",
    "several appendixes discuss many technical details omitted in the main text .",
    "next , we define and compare the wigner , husimi and bohmian phase space probability distributions for quantum systems .",
    "one quite common way of describing a quantum mechanical system in phase space is by the so - called wigner distribution ( @xmath23 ) . for a given state @xmath24",
    ", one can construct the density matrix operator @xmath25 and express it in the position representation @xmath26 or in the momentum representation @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , somehow , the wigner distribution can be interpreted as an intermediate representation between this two and it is given by a wigner - weyl transform of the density matrix :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 .",
    "we notice that the ( mathematical ) variable @xmath1 in the wigner ( quasi ) phase space @xmath6 appears due to a fourier transform of a type of autocorrelation function of the wave function . in the case of mixed states ,",
    "the density matrix can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 specifies the fraction of the ensemble in the pure state @xmath32 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we avoid the explicit time dependence of the wave function and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the wigner distribution function for a mixed state is the following :    @xmath33    hereafter , being the extension to mixed states straightforwardly @xcite achieved without any modification in the conclusions reached in this paper , for simplicity , we will consider only pure states .",
    "the wigner distribution is a quasi - probability distribution because it does not satisfy , in general , the condition given in eq .",
    "( [ cond1 ] ) for a well - defined phase space probability distribution . in appendix  [ neg_wig ]",
    "we can see why this distribution can be negative at some regions of the phase space .",
    "in addition , in sec .  [ sec3 ]",
    "we report a numerical example where the probability in the phase space is clearly negative .",
    "we can calculate also @xmath34 and @xmath35 directly using eq .",
    "( [ marg1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) .",
    "the results obtained ( the derivation can be seen at appendix  [ wigner_derivations ] ) are :    @xmath36    @xmath37    being @xmath38 the angle of the polar representation of the wave function @xmath39 ( for a detailed explanation see appendix  [ wigner_derivations ] ) .",
    "the results ( [ q_w ] ) and ( [ j_w ] ) are the ones that one will get by directly using @xmath24 . at this point , because of ( [ q_w ] ) and ( [ j_w ] ) , we see that @xmath40 is a good candidate to study quantum transport .",
    "however , we will see later that it is dangerous to take seriously the wigner ( quasi ) phase space when further developing the basic steps described here .",
    "for example , when including transitions between the phase space points @xmath6 and @xmath41 due to the ( fermi golden rule ) scattering .",
    "the husimi distribution ( @xmath42 ) is another possible phase space distribution built from the copenhagen school . in this case , it does satisfy the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) by construction . for this purpose",
    ", we use a set of minimum non - orthogonal uncertainty states localized in phase space ( @xmath43 ) @xcite . using them , the husimi distribution is the following :    @xmath44    if we use that @xmath45 , we achieve the following equation where it is reflected the positiveness of the husimi distribution :    @xmath46    however",
    ", it is not also a true probability distribution because it does not fulfil the marginal property ( [ marg1 ] ) .",
    "it can be also seen that the husimi distribution is just a gaussian smoothed and @xmath1 in the husimi ( quasi ) phase space @xmath6 are a smoothed version of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables of the wigner ( quasi ) phase space . ] version of the wigner distribution @xcite :    @xmath47    next , we will calculate the charge and current densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 similarly as done for the wigner function ( to see the complete derivation see appendix  [ wigner_derivations ] ) :    @xmath50    @xmath51    we can clearly see , that these results are the ones obtained for the wigner function , but smoothed by a gaussian function . from eq .",
    "( [ husimi ] ) we can understand why the husimi distribution does not accomplish eq .",
    "( [ marg1 ] ) .",
    "the broadening of the probabilities changes the momentum and position distributions . for these reasons",
    "it is considered also a quasi - probability distribution .",
    "the difficulties in properly providing the current and charge densities are a dramatic drawback for the correct simulation of quantum electronic devices with the husimi distribution .      in order to explain the bohmian phase space distribution",
    ", we briefly explain bohmian mechanics .",
    "it is a theory related to waves and particles .",
    "the evolution of the wave function is a solution of the typical schrdinger equation :    @xmath52    the wave function itself defines a local velocity for particles ,    @xmath53    let us emphasize that particles , here , mean point - like particles . for a more detailed explanation",

    "( [ distribution_bohmian ] ) , @xmath8 is a position of the trajectory in eq .",

    "( [ vel ] ) with the electron mass @xmath58 .",
    "let us emphasize that , by construction , the phase space distribution constructed with bohmian mechanics is always non - negative .",
    "the number of bohmian trajectories with momentum @xmath59 at the position @xmath0 must be positive ( or zero if there are no particles ) .    at this point",
    ", we want to emphasize an important clarification about the experimental measurement of the bohmian position and momentum . because of expression @xmath60 , in a single experiment , one can measure the position or the momentum , not both .",
    "however , contrarily to the copenhagen school , the bohmian theory does not renounce to a well - defined definition of position and momentum because of the mentioned experimental limitation .",
    "in addition , as we will further discuss in the conclusions , the bohmian phase space distribution is experimentally accessible from a proper treatment of the experimental data obtained from a weak measurement of momentum and positions in a large ensemble of experiments .    from the bohmian distribution , we can calculate the charge and current densities .",
    "@xmath61    @xmath62    as we can see , these results are exactly the same as the ones obtained from the wigner distribution ( and different from the ones obtained from the hussimi distribution ) .",
    "therefore , the bohmian distribution is an excellent tool to study quantum electron transport .",
    "in addition , in the next section we will show how the bohmian phase space distribution does not have the problems found for the wigner and the husimi distributions .",
    "according to the conceptual discussions in the previous sections , here , we provide numerical examples for the three mentioned quantum phase space distributions and the related charge density and current density . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a simple one - dimensional gaussian wave packet impinging in a symmetric double barrier . at the initial time",
    "@xmath63 , the wave function of a gaussian wave packet at the left of the barrier is :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the initial spatial variance of the wave packet , @xmath66 is the initial central position and @xmath67 is the central wave vector .",
    "in addition , for the husimi evolution , we used also the same dispersion : @xmath68 .",
    "the time evolution of the initial wave packet is computed by numerically solving the schrdinger equation ( [ scho ] ) .",
    "then , we compute the three quantum phase space distributions at three different times corresponding to the initial time @xmath69 , the time @xmath70 when the wave packet is interacting with the barrier and the time @xmath71 when the interaction is nearly finished and the initial wave packet is clearly split into a transmitted and a reflected components .",

    "[ fig1]-[fig3 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that the bohmian and husimi distributions have non - negative values everywhere at any time , satisfying clearly the first probability axiom ( [ cond1 ] ) . at the initial time , the wigner distribution is also non - negative , however , in later times at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , negative values appears in some regions of the phase space",
    ". we will further discuss such unphysical feature and their consequences later .",
    "we also want to emphasize that the bohmian distribution has only one value of the velocity at each position ( this is just a consequence that the wave function can take only a single - value at each position . ) .",
    "in fact , a realistic example in quantum transport must deal with open systems .",
    "then , the pure state has to be substituted by a mixed state ( a sum of conditional wave functions in the bohmian language ) and the bohmian distribution will provide a distribution of velocities ( each conditional wave function will have its own velocity ) at each position in a very natural way .",
    "we just avoid the consideration of mixed states to simplify the present discussion .",
    "next , we compare the charge and current densities calculated using eq .",
    "( [ marg1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) for the three quantum distributions .",
    "let us emphasize again that , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , the values obtained from the wigner and bohmian distributions are always exactly equal . however , the values of eq .",
    "( [ q_h ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ j_h ] ) for the husimi distribution does not provide the correct charge and current densities obtained from the wave function .",
    "we clearly see that the modulus squared of the wave packet ( blue lines ) in fig.[wp0 ] , fig.[wp1 ] and fig.[wp2 ] are equivalent to the charge density of the wigner and bohmian distributions , but not to the husimi one .    after confirming , from the numerical simulations ,",
    "the main features that we expect from the distributions ( i.e. the negative values of the wigner distribution , the mistaken results for the charge and current densities for the husimi distribution and the success in both aspects of the bohmian distribution ) we further discuss an important undesired characteristic of the wigner distribution . after the interaction with the double barrier , say at the time @xmath73 , the initial wave packets @xmath56 splits into a reflected @xmath74 part and a transmitted @xmath75 part .    as seen in the plot fig.[wp2 ] of the modulus squared of the wave function , the reflected part and transmitted part are located at both sides of the barrier ( not inside ) .",
    "identically , in the wigner distribution in fig.[wf2 ] we easily recognize the spatial locations of @xmath40 from the reflected @xmath74 and transmitted @xmath75 parts .",
    "however , in addition , there are large non - zero values ( negative and positive , because when integrating in this region of the phase space the result must be zero ) of @xmath40 in the middle of the barrier , @xmath76 , at places where no probability presence of the electron is supposed to be according to fig.[wp2 ] .",
    "the mathematical reason of such spurious result is clear from the wigner - weyl transform . at time @xmath73 , the spatially separated reflected @xmath74 and transmitted @xmath75 parts of the wave function @xmath56 have to be spatially displaced a distance @xmath77 to compute @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ wigner - psi ] ) .",
    "in particular , for the value of @xmath78 , we get @xmath79 and @xmath80 , plus @xmath81 and @xmath82 . finally , according to eq .",
    "( [ wigner - psi ] ) , the @xmath40 at time @xmath73 at position @xmath83 for any value of the momentum @xmath1 is :    @xmath84    since @xmath85 is the distance between barrier and the reflected part , which we consider equal to the distance between the transmitted part of the barrier , the product @xmath86 in ( [ error ] ) is different from zero at the barrier region @xmath87 .    in order to clarify the consequences of this unphysical feature described in eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) ( we know from the wave function evolution that there are no electron probability there ! ) , we remind that by integrating the positive and negative values of @xmath40 around @xmath87 we will reproduce correctly the charge density at this point .",
    "there is no charge density at position @xmath88 in fig.[ch2 ] .",
    "however , if one tries to gives a physical meaning to @xmath40 at these points in fig.[wf2 ] ( as a _ true _ physical probability distribution of the electron at the phase space ) , one must be very careful .",
    "for example , let us imagine that we introduce an _ ad - hoc _ scattering term ( due to impurities , for example ) in the quantum equation of motion of the wigner function .",
    "if such _ ad - hoc _ term is introduced as a transition from an old phase space point @xmath89 towards a new point @xmath90 through the fermi golden rule probability @xmath91 , we are moving electrons from places ( for example @xmath88 ) where there are no electrons . the mistake in the transition of probability from regions without electrons",
    "is because we introduce the scattering mechanism by hand as an extra _ ad - hoc _ term in the quantum equation of motion of the wigner function .",
    "obviously , this spurious effect will not be present if the scattering mechanism ( with the impurity ) is introduced directly in the hamiltonian inside the quantum equation of motion .",
    "the mentioned undesired features will not occur within the bohmian distribution , because as seen in fig .",
    "[ bf2 ] , we only see non - zero ( positive ) probabilities at locations where the electron may be reflected or transmitted , but not in other regions .",
    "in this work , we discuss the motivations and interests for constructing a _ true _ ( well - defined ) phase space distribution for quantum systems .",
    "we have shown that , both , the wigner and husimi distributions ( related to _",

    "( [ negative_wigner ] ) , carries negative values that can not be supported by a well - defined quantum probability distribution in phase space .",
    "of course , when properly integrated , correct probability distributions are found out for the charge and current densities . however ,",
    "the _ ad - hoc _ manipulation of the wigner distribution function can lead to incorrect results ( we saw for instance in sec .",

    "only has positive values .",
    "however , we can not obtain successfully the charge and current densities .",

    "from this unquestionable result , the copenhagen school renounces to an ( ontological ) definition of the momentum at one particular position ( i.e. renouncing , in fact , to a proper definition of the phase space ) , while the bohmian school did not renounce to it .",
    "nowadays , with our technological advances in carefully measuring ( i.e. interacting with ) a quantum system , the wigner and bohmian phase space distributions are , in fact , associable with experiments in a laboratory . in both cases ,",
    "the trick is repeating the experiment many times ( not only one ) and treating the data of such a large ensemble of experiments in a proper way . regarding the wigner function , it is measured using the so - called quantum tomography . for example , one can measure the electric field quadratures @xcite in many different experiments . using these data and with the help of some mathematical expressions",
    ", a phase space can be reconstructed through the wigner function distribution ( with its negative values ) .",
