    "all laboratory flames are subject to the terrestrial gravitational field whose influence on the process of deflagration is often prominent .",
    "in fact , for many premixed flames evolving spontaneously this influence is dominant as regards formation of the large - scale flame structure .",
    "this is because deflagrations involve flows of markedly different densities , characterized by essentially subsonic fluid velocities .",
    "a simple dimensional analysis suggests that under these conditions , the relative gravity impact can be estimated as @xmath2 it follows that propagation of all hydrocarbon - air flames in tubes wider than 1 cm is strongly affected by the gravitational field , the impact being especially pronounced for flames with low local consumption rates .",
    "observations fully confirm this conclusion . under the action of gravity , the front area considerably increases , and proportionally increases the flame speed . in the regime of uniform movement , _",
    "i.e. , _ when the flame speed remains grossly constant , it may be tens times the normal flame speed .",
    "for instance , the normal flame speed in the mixture of @xmath3 methane with air under standard conditions is about 0.1 m/s , while its propagation speed in tubes of 1 m diameter is 1.5 m/s .",
    "a vulgar description of the gravitational influence on flame dynamics is that it is a kind of buoyancy effect , and in the case of flame propagation in horizontal tubes goes as follows @xcite .",
    "the light products of combustion moving upward tend to occupy space above the heavy fresh gas , which causes the flame front to tilt and spread along the tube .",
    "this view is actually inadequate , if only because it implies that the process of flame spreading ought to last indefinitely . indeed ,",
    "if buoyancy were the driving force , any tilted flame configuration would be unstable against further front flattening , which would result in unbounded growth of the flame speed .",
    "as a matter of fact , no description of flame behavior in terms of forces can be adequate , because this behavior is essentially determined by the properties of the mass flow through the flame front , and it is flow velocities that are the right terms to describe these properties .",
    "the true mechanism governing flame evolution in the strong gravitational field is the baroclinic effect  the gravity - induced generation of vorticity inside the flame front .",
    "it is thus vortical motion of the burnt gases that is responsible for the formation of titled flame configuration .",
    "flame spreading stabilizes when vorticity generated by the flame front curvature becomes comparable to the baroclinic vorticity ( cf . sec .",
    "[ reduction ] ) .    in view of practical and theoretical importance of horizontal flame propagation",
    ", it was thoroughly investigated already at the dawn of modern combustion science .",
    "the very existence of the regime of uniform movement was established by mallard and le chatelier @xcite , after which it was scrutinized by mason and wheeler @xcite , mason @xcite , coward and greenwald @xcite , and in the famous works by coward and hartwell @xcite .",
    "the latter summarized and extended the results of the preceding works to infer normal flame speeds in mixtures of various composition , and to establish relationship between the propagation speed and tube diameter , which was shown to be more complicated than the simple power law .    despite extensive experimental data acquired on the horizontal flame propagation",
    ", there has been lack of adequate theoretical description of this process .",
    "the reason for this is obvious : the large increase of flame velocity caused by the gravitational field implies that the process is strongly nonlinear , and hence is out of reach of the classic approach based on explicit solving of the bulk flow equations .",
    "the necessity to solve these equations explicitly is indeed the stumbling block of this approach already in the case of freely propagating flames , which restricts its applicability to flames with weak gas expansion .",
    "namely , the fresh - to - burnt gas - density ratio , @xmath4 must be close to unity in order to damp the nonlinear effects @xcite . under this condition ,",
    "the horizontal flame propagation was considered in @xcite .",
    "the relative flame velocity increase within the small @xmath5-expansion is small by definition , as is vorticity produced by the flame . at the same time , laboratory flames have @xmath6 and produce strongly nonlinear rotational flows of burnt matter . therefore ,",
    "application of the weak gas expansion approximation to flames in horizontal tubes can be only of academic interest .",
    "furthermore , the above remark on the role of the baroclinic effect shows that the potential flow models such as frankel s @xcite , or the bubble model @xcite are also irrelevant .",
    "the latter , for instance , replaces the flame by an open inert bubble moving in a horizontal channel , and gives for the steady flame speed the value @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the gravity acceleration , @xmath9 the channel width ) , which badly disagrees with observations . as was already mentioned , relation between the flame speed and tube diameter ( channel width ) is not that simple .",
    "a way round the problem of solving the bulk equations was found in @xcite where exact equations for the fresh gas velocity at the flame front ( the _ on - shell _ velocity , for brevity ) were obtained for two - dimensional ( 2d ) steady flame with arbitrary gas expansion .",
    "specifically , it was shown that the velocity field of burnt gases can be decomposed into rotational and potential components in such a way that the on - shell value of the former can be explicitly expressed in terms of the on - shell fresh gas velocity , while retaining incompressibility and boundedness of the latter .",
    "these properties of the unknown potential component were then used to exclude it from the set of jump conditions at the front by applying an integral identity ( the _ dispersion relation _ ) following from the cauchy theorem .",
    "the result is an exact complex integro - differential equation ( the _ master equation _ ) for the on - shell fresh gas velocity and the flame front position , which together with the evolution equation constitutes a closed system .",
    "this _ on - shell formulation _ was subsequently generalized to unsteady flames @xcite , and applied to various essentially nonperturbative problems @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give rigorous theoretical description of horizontal flame propagation . using the on - shell formulation",
    ", it will be shown that the problem of uniform flame movement admits complete solution in the 2d case .",
    "namely , the set of the on - shell equations will be reduced in sec .",
    "[ reduction ] to a single second - order differential equation for the front position .",
    "this reduction relies on the large front - slope asymptotic expansion of the master equation , constructed in @xcite .",
    "experiments show that in sufficiently wide tubes , flames are subject to a kind of turbulent motion observed as a swirling of the flame front .",
    "occurrence of a small - scale structure generally makes the large - slope approximation inapplicable .",
    "an auxiliary but important result proved in sec .",
    "[ widechan ] is that regarding the large - scale flame evolution , the leading - order effect of this structure is to renormalize the normal flame speed ; the proof follows closely @xcite .",

    "consider a 2d flame propagating in an initially quiescent gaseous mixture filling horizontal channel of width @xmath9 with ideal walls .",
    "relevance of this picture to the three - dimensional laboratory flames will be discussed in sec .",
    "we choose cartesian coordinates @xmath10 so that the @xmath11-axis is along the upper channel wall , @xmath12 being in the fresh gas .",
    "then the flame front position at time @xmath13 can be described by an equation @xmath14 let @xmath15 denote cartesian components of the gas velocity vector @xmath16 even though the flame speed in horizontal tubes often considerably exceeds the normal speed , gas flows induced by the propagating flame remain essentially subsonic .",
    "this allows the fluid be considered as incompressible , and its density , @xmath17 be taken constant on both sides of the flame front .",

    "derivation of eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) is based on a periodic continuation of the flame pattern along the @xmath26-axis , which proceeds in two steps : first , using the boundary conditions @xmath34 ( which express impermeability and ideality of the upper wall ) , the given flame pattern is carried from the physical domain @xmath35 $ ] over to @xmath36 $ ] by reflection with respect to the @xmath11-axis .",
    "the resulting symmetric pattern satisfying @xmath37 is then periodically continued along the whole @xmath26-axis ( using the same boundary conditions at the other wall ) .",
    "this trick is very convenient as it allows one to avoid explicit account of the boundary conditions , but it is physically inadequate in the presence of gravitational field perpendicular to the walls .",
    "this is because reflection performed at the first step leads to a discontinuity in the gravitational field ",
    "its strength , @xmath38 being directed downward in the physical domain , turns out to be directed upward in the image domain , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) . in itself",
    ", this discontinuity is not a problem , because whether or not given configuration is physically relevant depends on its principal feasibility , and in the present case it is not difficult to find a setting realizing physical conditions of the symmetric configuration .",
    "namely , occurrence of a discontinuity in @xmath39 suggests that the terrestrial gravitational field is to be replaced in the symmetric case by the field of a thin dense layer located near the plane @xmath40 taking its surface density equal to @xmath41 ( @xmath42 @xmath43 is the newton gravitational constant ) then yields gravitational field of the same strength as terrestrial , but opposite to it in the physical domain , so that the proper symmetric pattern is as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . in this",
    "setting , the true flame configuration is obtained by a vertical translation from the image domain , @xmath44 or by flipping the physical domain , @xmath45 moreover , one can avoid this technical complication by introducing an electrically charged layer instead of the gravitating one , and assuming that the fresh and burnt gases are uniformly charged like the layer , with vanishingly small ( to neglect electric interaction of different gas elements ) charge densities standing in the same ratio as the mass densities , _ viz . , _",
    "@xmath46 but in any case , the symmetric configuration can not be periodically continued in the @xmath26-direction , because of interference of the fields produced by the layers : since the field of each additional layer is homogeneous , it can not be neglected in the physical domain , which makes the continuation meaningless .",
    "fortunately , the on - shell description can be reformulated in a way that permits application to symmetric flame configurations independently of whether they admit periodic continuation .",
    "this reformulation was developed in @xcite for flames propagating in symmetric channels with arbitrarily curved walls .",
    "it uses the method of green functions to explicitly take into account boundary conditions at the walls , which leads to the following modification of the master equation @xmath47 ' - \\frac{m\\omega_+}{v^2_+ } + \\frac{1+if'}{2b}\\int_{-b}^{+b}d\\eta\\frac{m(\\eta)\\omega_+(\\eta)}{v^2_+(\\eta)}\\right\\ } = 0\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 this equation differs from eq .",
    "( [ master1 ] ) by the last term in the braces , which is proportional to the spatial average of the second term across the channel .",
    "as was noticed in @xcite , the structure of the new term suggests that it describes an effective gravitational field along the channel , which appears in the system as a result of the curved flame evolution . for steady flame propagation in straight channels ,",
    "such effective gravity presumably should vanish , for the opposite would mean that the flame is self - accelerating .",

    "it does vanish as the average of an odd periodic function .",
    "however , its imaginary part is even , and there is no apparent reason why it should be zero . using the small @xmath5-expansion , it can be shown that this quantity is indeed zero at least to the fourth post - sivashinsky approximation ( which corresponds to retaining terms of the seventh order in @xmath5 in the master equation ) @xcite , but the general proof is still lacking .",
    "we return to this issue in secs .",
    "[ ident ] , [ conclusions ] .    equation ( [ master2 ] ) will be used below in the study of uniform flame movement .",
    "it was already mentioned that the speed of uniform movement in wide horizontal tubes largely exceeds the normal flame speed .",
    "experiments indicate that flames propagating in tubes of diameter @xmath50 cm have fairly smooth elongated fronts , in which case flame speed is directly proportional to the front area . in wider tubes , flames develop complex unsteady small - scale structures observed as a widening of the front .",
    "the envelope surface retains highly elongated shape , but now part of the velocity increase is due to the small - scale wrinkling , which according to @xcite adds @xmath51 to the speed of uniform movement in comparison with the smooth patterns .",
    "it follows that in the corresponding 2d case of flame propagation in channels of moderate all channels with @xmath52 ought to be qualified as wide . in the present investigation",
    ", however , it is more convenient to associate this term with the onset of instability of smooth flame configuration . ]",
    "width ( @xmath5310 cm ) , the front slope is large , @xmath54 everywhere across the channel except narrow regions near the walls , where the front slope drops down to zero .",
    "the width of these regions is of order of the cutoff wavelength , @xmath55 related to the finite front - thickness effects which determine flame structure near the front end - points .",
    "@xmath56 is generally larger for slower flames , but in no case does it exceed a few millimeters , whereas @xmath572.5 cm in the experiments considered below .",
    "thus , flame propagation in channels of moderate width can be adequately studied within the large - slope approximation . in wider channels ( @xmath5810 cm ) , condition @xmath59 is violated by the small - scale wrinkling , remaining valid only on average . as will be proved in sec .",
    "[ widechan ] , the results obtained for smooth fronts hold true for wrinkled flames described in terms of averaged flow variables , which makes the large - slope approximation universally applicable to flame propagation in channels of any width .",
    "a fact of fundamental importance for implementation of the large - slope approximation is the locality of steady flame patterns at large flow velocities , first discovered in the study of anchored flames @xcite .",
    "this locality means that in regions where @xmath54 front curvature at any point is uniquely determined by the front position and its slope at the same point .",
    "a similar statement is true of the on - shell gas velocity . in other words ,",
    "these functions satisfy ordinary differential equations . and",
    "@xmath60 at any point .",
    "in this way , a nonlocal impact of flame anchors was described in @xcite . ]",
    "the underlying mathematical reason is that the operator @xmath61 which mainly determines the nonlocal structure of the master equation , becomes localizable when the front slope is large .",
    "namely , its large - slope expansion reads , in the natural units ( we consider henceforth the symmetric pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the sign function , @xmath64 it is because of the step - like asymptotic form of the integral kernel of @xmath31 that the master equation reduces eventually to an ordinary differential equation .",
    "the other possible source of non - locality is the last term in eq .",
    "( [ master2 ] ) , which depends on the values of @xmath65 at every point of the front , including the regions where the large - slope approximation is not valid .",
    "a remarkable fact to be proved below is that this term does not prevent localization , falling off eventually from the master equation .    the following version of eq .",
    "( [ hcurvedf1 ] ) , expressing the action of @xmath31 on a derivative , is also useful : @xmath66 where the prime denotes derivative of the function with respect to its argument , @xmath67 an important result proved in @xcite is that this formula holds true for functions allowed to have a discontinuity at the origin .      the local rate of consumption of fresh gas is determined by the so - called evolution equation which expresses the normal fresh gas velocity relative to the front as a local functional of the front slope and the on - shell gas velocity . in view of this locality ,",
    "the evolution equation for zero - thickness flames is that for planar flames , _ viz . , _",
    "@xmath68 ( dot denotes time differentiation ) , whereas account of the transport processes inside the front adds to the right - hand side terms proportional to the front thickness .",
    "the relative value of these terms is of order @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the wavelength of the front wrinkling .",
    "therefore , they do not affect flame propagation in channels of moderate width .",
    "on the other hand , it was already mentioned that the results obtained for smooth patterns apply also to wrinkled flames upon averaging over the small - scale structure .",
    "hence , it will be sufficient to use the master equation along with the evolution equation for zero - thickness steady flames , which in terms of the cartesian velocity components reads , in the natural units , @xmath71 in the leading order of the large - slope expansion , it can be written as @xmath72 this is for @xmath73 _ i.e. , _",
    "@xmath74 in the configuration of fig .",

    "hence , the longitudinal component of the on - shell gas velocity , @xmath76 is @xmath77 next , the total mass conservation implies that @xmath78 therefore , of the same order is the ( smooth ) front slope , @xmath79 equation ( [ evolutiongen1 ] ) then implies that the other ( transversal ) velocity component @xmath80 an equation relating the three functions can be obtained from the following dispersion relation @xcite @xmath81 which is a consequence of potentiality , incompressibility and boundedness of the flow upstream .",

    "we note that in view of locality of the steady flame structure , announced in the preceding section , initial conditions for the ordinary differential equations satisfied by @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 can be specified at any internal point of the physical domain where the front slope is large , say , @xmath109 the values of the slope and the on - shell velocity at this point determine the whole flame pattern . ) .",

    "the question as to what extent the results of 2d analysis are applicable in 3d situation is quite nontrivial , and in each particular problem requires special consideration . to settle it in the present case",
    ", we turn to fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] which is a series of snap - shot photographs of the early stage of flame evolution after ignition , made at equal time intervals , in a glass tube of @xmath320 cm @xcite .",
    "it shows that as the flame travels along the tube , its initially hemispherical front not only tilts but also flattens , as is evident from the fact that the front image becomes thinner .",
    "this observation suggests that the flame shape in the regime of uniform movement can be described using 2d tools , and implies that the channel width is to be set equal to the tube diameter . as to the speed of uniform movement , it was proposed in @xcite that the 2d values are to be multiplied by a factor @xmath321 to obtain the flame speed in a tube ( of diameter equal to the channel width ) , the reason being that this relation holds for bubbles of similar shape .",
    "however , as was already mentioned in introduction , the theory of bubble motion is irrelevant to flame propagation . as a matter of fact",
    ", there is a solid reason to expect that no such factor is to be introduced in flame theory .",
    "the point is that unlike bubbles , flames propagate because they consume fuel ; the rate of this consumption is proportional to the flame front area , which is determined by the slope of front elements , rather than their azimuth with respect to the tube axis .",
    "thus , the relative velocity increase of 2d and 3d flames is the same if they have the same average slope .",
    "the misleading analogy with bubbles helps to consider this issue from a somewhat different standpoint . to get insight into how flame dimensionality might affect its speed , compare propagation of flames and bubbles in a channel and in a tube of equal size",
    ". to simplify geometry , it is more convenient to deal with vertical propagation , wherein 3d shapes can be assumed axisymmetric . consider first bubble motion , and let the 3d bubble shape be obtained from the corresponding 2d channel pattern by rotating it around the tube axis .",
    "the bubble speed depends essentially on the relative cross - sectional area of the jet formed between the bubble and the walls , which is evidently larger in the 3d case .",
    "the same geometrical reason suggests that if it were possible to obtain an axisymmetric flame by rotating a 2d pattern around the tube axis , then the speed of this flame would indeed be larger than the speed of its 2d original as proposed in @xcite , since the front slope grows with distance from the tube axis .",
    "however , such rotation would violate flow continuity , for the gas elements burnt near the tube wall come from regions of lesser radial distance from the axis ( cf .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) , whereas the flow far upstream remains homogeneous .",
    "therefore , instead of increasing the speed of propagation , 3d flame has to reduce its longitudinal spread to maintain flow continuity . on the other hand ,",
    "retaining continuity in the case of bubbles of fixed shape is not a problem , for their motion is not bound to satisfy such condition as the constancy of local consumption rate .",
    "we thus see that the difference in the mechanisms governing propagation of bubbles and flames implies essentially different sensitivity to the flow dimensionality .",
    "it can be added that in complete analogy with the 2d case , the effect of small - scale 3d front structures amounts to renormalization of the local propagation law ( the proof is almost identical to that given in the preceding section ) . to be sure",
    ", these arguments do not affirm equality of propagation speeds of 2d and 3d flames , but they point toward certain rigidity of the flame speed with respect to manifestations of the three - dimensional nature of the problem , such as occurrence of pronounced 3d front structures , or circularity of the tube cross - section . on these grounds , the speed of uniform movement of flame in a tube of diameter @xmath322 will be identified henceforth with the speed of steady 2d flame propagating in a channel of equal width , @xmath323      for flat - on - average flames , heat losses to the tube walls are usually of minor importance in regard to the flame speed , for their relative value rapidly decreases with increasing tube diameter .",
    "thus , although preventing flame propagation in very narrow tubes , heat losses are practically negligible in tubes of a few centimeters diameter .",
    "for instance , the speed of downward propagation of planar methane - air flames near the limits of inflammability ( in which case the gravity and transport effects completely stabilize planar front ) is the same in tubes of @xmath324 cm and @xmath325 cm @xcite , implying that even for slowest flames the cooling effect is negligible already in tubes of @xmath326 cm diameter .",
    "things are different , however , for horizontally propagating flames , because the large flame spread along the tube considerably enhances heat outflow from the front , reducing thereby the flame speed .",
    "the rate of this outflow is , in the ordinary units , @xmath327 where @xmath328 is the area of the tube surface surrounding the front ( the factor @xmath329 accounts for the fact that heat is transferred only from the hot side of the front ) , @xmath330 the temperature difference between the cold wall and burnt gas , and @xmath331 the heat transfer coefficient . on the other hand , the longitudinal heat flux due to deflagration",
    "is @xmath332 where @xmath333 is the specific heat of combustion , and @xmath334 is the cold gas density .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath335 where @xmath336 is the average specific heat capacity of fresh gas , gives the relative velocity drop due to the heat losses to the walls .",
    "it is seen that this parameter depends neither on @xmath337 nor on @xmath174 in application to flame propagation in methane - air mixtures under standard conditions , @xmath338kg / m@xmath339 @xmath340 ranges 1.3 to 1.8kj / kg@xmath341k , depending on the methane concentration , while the heat transfer coefficient for tubular air / metal heat exchangers ranges 5 to 35w / m@xmath342k @xcite .",
    "as no relevant information is given in the cited workscm ( cf .",
    "this conclusion was apparently shared by coward and hartwell despite their discovery that the large increase of flame speed in horizontal tubes is the result of large longitudinal flame spread . ]",

    "it is worth recalling in this connection that the master equation ( [ master2 ] ) itself was derived in the sense of analytic continuation to the limit of zero viscosity @xcite .    to identify relevant solutions",

    "the above consideration leads us to the conclusion that the rapid change in flame speed , observed in the range of concentrations @xmath512 to @xmath513 represents transition between type i and type ii regimes of flame propagation . to get insight into the nature of this transition ,",

    "[ fig12 ] containing the flame speed data in @xmath514 mixture .",
    "the following consideration shows that this data points toward existence of an intermittency of the two regimes in transient mixtures .",

    "in fact , the error of calculation for this tube diameter is @xmath517 for type i and @xmath518 for type ii solution , so the distance of the mark from either curve is well above the error of calculation ( this mark is due to @xcite according to which the experimental error is about @xmath519@xmath520).cm , the data is inconclusive , since the two curves are close to each other , whereas calculational error is relatively large for this tube diameter , @xmath521 this observation can be easily explained if we admit that the flame undergoes transitions between the two regimes as it travels in the tube .",
    "this explanation is suggested by the very fact that the given mixture is transient , and is most naturally formulated in terms of stability of the solutions .",
    "indeed , that the mixtures with @xmath522 propagate only type i flames means evidently that type ii solutions are unstable in these mixtures ( or , at least , that they are considerably less stable than those of type i ) , and that situation is opposite in mixtures with @xmath523 it is therefore natural to expect that in the @xmath514 mixture , the two types of solutions are approximately even regarding their stability properties .",
    "intermittency occurs if both solutions are unstable or neutrally stable .",
    "the coexistence of two solutions with similar stability properties is not sufficient to establish intermittency in the case when they are stable , for it would not exist without a mechanism that continuously provokes switching of the propagation regimes .",
    "however , such mechanism is readily identified .",
    "namely , it is not difficult to see that fluctuations of the heat flux due to heat losses into the walls are sufficient to trigger transition from one regime of flame propagation to the other . for this to happen ,",
    "the heat inflow / outflow , @xmath524 necessary to accelerate / decelerate the flame must be comparable to the difference of kinetic energies of gases in the two regimes , and occur on a time interval less than the characteristic time of perturbation damping . for the gravity - controlled flame evolution this time is of order @xmath525 multiplying it by @xmath526 from sec .  [ losses ] yields @xmath527w for type i solution ( @xmath528 ) , or in the natural units , @xmath529 for type ii solution ( @xmath530 ) the figure is @xmath456 times larger . on the other hand ,",
    "the kinetic energy of gases in the volume surrounded by @xmath531 can be evaluated as @xmath532 which gives @xmath533 and @xmath534 therefore , even a few - percent local fluctuation of the heat transfer coefficient will produce @xmath535 sufficient to switch the propagation regime .",
    "the resulting intermittency can in principle be observed as a recurring appearance of an inflection point at the front head ( cf . figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "the above stability consideration implies that flames in transient mixtures are particularly susceptible to such fluctuations , but the described mechanism may work also in mixtures where the two regimes of flame propagation are of markedly different stability . in that case , a more intensive fluctuation of the heat flux is required to perturb the flame , as the damping time is shorter in more stable regimes , and no proper intermittency occurs .    for an experimental evidence of the proposed scenario ,",
    "let us turn to the work @xcite remarkable , in particular , by its scrupulous exposition of the experimental procedures .",
    "regarding flame propagation in a tube @xmath536 m long and @xmath537 cm in diameter , the authors mention that `` some experiments demonstrated that there was a varying of the flame speed throughout the tube , an occurrence which was more frequent the more disturbed the external atmosphere , '' and emphasize that experiments were made only when the wind was negligible near the open end of the tube ( cf .",
    "17 , 20 , and 22 in @xcite ) .",
    "the latter precaution excludes direct atmospheric impact on the burnt gas flow , implying that the observed variations in the flame speed are caused by variations of the external conditions along the tube . that the value of the heat transfer coefficient strongly depends on the ambient air conditions is well known .",
    "returning to consideration of the function @xmath440 one finds that the flame speed behavior at methane concentrations larger than @xmath538 is quite similar to that at @xmath539 namely , comparison of the theoretical and experimental data for a @xmath540 mixture , fig .",
    "[ fig13](a ) , shows that this mixture sustains type ii regime , whereas flames propagating in @xmath541 and @xmath542 mixtures are of type i in tubes of any diameter , as is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig13](c),[fig13](d ) , and as was contemplated in the qualitative analysis of the experimental data , given earlier .",
    "figure [ fig13](b ) suggests that the @xmath543 mixture is transient , again in conformity with the observation that the flame speed decreases most rapidly on the interval @xmath544 although proximity to the right end - point of this interval does not give good grounds to affirm intermittency in this mixture : the distance of the experimental marks for @xmath515 cm and @xmath516 cm from the curve representing type i solution only slightly exceeds the calculational errors ( @xmath545 and @xmath504 respectively ) .",
    "analysis of the horizontal flame propagation , carried out in sec .",
    "[ onshell ] , revealed existence of two different types of steady flame patterns formed under the strong influence of the gravitational field .",
    "characteristic of type i flames is the existence of an inflection point at the flame front head , with an associated pronounced maximum of transversal component of the on - shell fresh gas velocity .",
    "the longitudinal component of the gas velocity increases monotonically along the front in both cases , but more rapidly in type ii flames which always propagate faster than type i flames under the same conditions .",
    "next , it was found in sec .",
    "[ ident ] that there is exactly one solution of each type , satisfying the physical requirement of asymptotic homogeneity of the burnt gas flow . at last , detailed comparison with the experimental data on methane - air flames , performed in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] , showed that both regimes are realized in practice : mixtures near the limits of inflammability propagate only type i flames , whereas flames in mixtures close to the stoichiometric composition follow the faster type ii regime .",
    "this result resolves the difficulty mentioned in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] , namely that the experimental data for the flame speed versus tube diameter can not be fitted into a single - valued function : two flames with equal @xmath455 have different velocities in tubes of the same diameter because they propagate in regimes of different type .",
    "furthermore , inflection points in the functions @xmath445 correspond to transitions between the two regimes of flame propagation , which take place in the regions characterized by rapid changes of the flame speed .",
    "the comparison also clarifies the origin of infections in the curves representing flame speed versus tube diameter .",
    "namely , the small - scale wrinkling that develops in wide tubes effectively increases the normal flame speed , reducing thereby the heat losses : according to eq .",
    "( [ loss ] ) , they are damped by a factor @xmath546 this effect is especially pronounced in mixtures near inflammability limits where the heat losses are significant , and is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig13](c),[fig13](d ) . of course",
    ", this leaves open the question why complex front structures develop in tubes of @xmath547 cm , but this is entirely a stability issue .",
    "incidentally , occurrence of these structures can not be described as a result of development of the darrieus - landau instability : behavior of flame perturbations in the highly nonlinear flows generated by flames propagating with @xmath548 is completely different from that found for planar flames @xcite . in this connection ,",
    "a general fact to be emphasized is that formation of steady flame patterns as well as dynamics of disturbances of flames with @xmath548 is essentially determined by vorticity production in the flame . in the considered case of horizontal flame propagation",
    ", this process is controlled by the baroclinic effect .    a technical issue that deserves special discussion is the identification of physical solutions . as was already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ ident ] , the requirement of asymptotic homogeneity of the burnt gas flow , used to select physical solutions , is intimately related to the fact that within the on - shell approach , flow dynamics is considered in the limit of vanishing viscosity .",
    "it was also pointed out that the criterion identifying physical solutions may probably be formulated as the requirement of vanishing of the parameter @xmath136 that describes effective gravity in the system , although this can not be asserted based on approximate evaluation of @xmath136 in sec .",
    "[ ident ] .",
    "what can be affirmed , however , is that @xmath136 is certainly nonzero far from physical solutions , and in view of equivalence of gravity and translatory acceleration , this has an important implication regarding the phenomenon of flame self - acceleration .",
    "to explain the point , let us allow for small but nonzero viscosity .",
    "this introduces no appreciable changes in the structure of type i or type ii solutions , but significantly changes criterion for selecting physical solutions .",
    "the reason is that the viscous drag exerted by the walls , which now can not be neglected , causes additional energy losses by the gas flow , increasing with the distance traveled by the flame . for sufficiently small viscosity ( such that the viscous length @xmath549 ) this process can be considered quasi - steady .",
    "to compensate for the additional losses , a larger kinetic energy flux @xmath369 is required .",
    "an immediate consequence is that this causes _ deceleration _ of type i flames , and _ acceleration _ of type ii flames , as is evident from fig .",
