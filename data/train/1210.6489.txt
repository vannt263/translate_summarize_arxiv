    "the observation of superconductivity in the noncentrosymmetric heavy fermion compound cept@xmath0si opened up a new field of research on superconductors,@xcite which nowadays stands in the focus of intense research efforts ( for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most notably , subsequent to the discovery of superconductivity in cept@xmath0si similar superconducting states were observed in closely related ce intermetallics , _ viz .",
    "_ , cerhsi@xmath0 , ceirsi@xmath0 , cecoge@xmath0 and ceirge@xmath0.@xcite similar to other ce heavy fermion superconductors,@xcite for the noncentrosymmetric systems there is a close relation between ( the suppression of ) magnetic order and the appearance of superconducting states.@xcite these observations mostly were derived from studies of the ground state properties of the materials under externally applied pressure . here , in particular , the behavior of cept@xmath0si has been investigated quite extensively under applied pressure.@xcite    at ambient pressure , cept@xmath0si was reported to crystallize in the tetragonal noncentrosymmetric cept@xmath0b structure ( space group @xmath8),@xcite with lattice parameters @xmath9    and @xmath10  . based on various studies by means of thermodynamic as well as microscopic techniques",
    "the system was characterized as heavy fermion ( @xmath11 j / mole k@xmath12 ) superconductor below @xmath5  k ( 0.45 k in a high quality single crystal).@xcite moreover , it was established that superconductivity coexists with a long - range antiferromagnetically ordered state , with an ordering wave vector @xmath13 of strongly reduced moments @xmath14/ce being detected below the n@xmath15el temperature @xmath6 k.@xcite    the superconducting state in cept@xmath0si is believed to be of an unconventional nature , although as yet a detailed description of superconductivity has not been developed .",
    "further , the lack of inversion symmetry causes a spin - orbit splitting of the fermi surface , which might generate chiral spin states.@xcite as result of the various pressure studies , most notably it is found that the antiferromagnetic state is already suppressed at a pressure of about 0.6 gpa , while superconductivity persists up to a pressure of 1.5 gpa .",
    "thus , for noncentrosymmetric cept@xmath0si the appearance of superconductivity is closely linked to the suppression of magnetic order , although here quantum critical behavior has not been observed in the various physical properties .",
    "the ternary compound cept@xmath0b is isostructural to the heavy fermion superconductor cept@xmath0si , with lattice parameters @xmath16    and @xmath17 .@xcite with these - compared to cept@xmath0si - much smaller lattice parameters it might be argued that chemical pressure effects take place here , such that in some sense cept@xmath0b would represent a high pressure variant of cept@xmath0si . however , with the replacement of si by b the electron count is lower by one electron in cept@xmath0b . naively , one could argue that this should tend to weaken the hybridization strength because of a lower electron density corresponding to a reduced chemical pressure .",
    "effectively , the experimentally observed physical properties of cept@xmath0b appear to lead to the conclusion that this material is a local moment magnet with much weaker electronic correlations than cept@xmath0si . based on thermodynamic and transport experiments",
    "it has been established that cept@xmath0b undergoes two magnetic transition at low temperatures , the first one into a presumably antiferromagnetic ( afm ) state below @xmath3 k , the latter one into a state with a weakly ferromagnetic ( fm ) signature below @xmath18 k. here , to account for the two magnetic phases in cept@xmath0b one would argue that there is a transition of large magnetic moments ( order of magnitude @xmath19 ) into an antiferromagnetic structure below @xmath20 , and which transforms into a weakly ferromagnetic one below @xmath21 through canting of the magnetic moments . within this line of thought",
    ", the canting might be a consequence of the lacking inversion symmetry , as this would give rise to an additional magnetic exchange term , the dzyahloshinskii - moriya interaction.@xcite here , a magnetic exchange term @xmath22 between two spins @xmath23 , @xmath24 on sites without inversion symmetry , if combined with a ferro- or antiferromagnetic coupling , produces complex magnetic states such as canted or helical structures.@xcite    surprisingly , in a recent study of the magnetically ordered phases of cept@xmath0b by means of neutron scattering and muon spin rotation ( @xmath25 ) this scenario could not be verified.@xcite on the one hand , in @xmath25 experiments both transitions @xmath20 and @xmath21 have been identified as bulk transitions .",
    "as well , the muon precession frequency does suggest the presence of a fairly large ordered magnetic moment in both phases . on the other hand , in neutron powder diffraction",
    "no additional intensity from scattering in the magnetically ordered phase has been observed .",
    "as yet , this failure to detect magnetic intensity in neutron scattering is not understood .",
    "given that cept@xmath0si and cept@xmath0b are isostructural , the question arises if there is a relationship between the magnetically ordered phases in both compounds .",
    "one possible route to study this topic is an alloying experiment on the series of materials cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 for @xmath26 . here",
    ", it can be studied how the antiferromagnetic state of cept@xmath0si evolves out of that of cept@xmath0b , and if the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure plays a role in defining the magnetic ground state . in the following",
    "we will present such a study . we will characterize the structural and physical ground state properties of the alloying series cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 , and in particular will discuss our data in terms of chemical pressure effects .",
    "polycrystalline samples of cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 , @xmath26 , have been prepared by high frequency melting the constituents in stoichiometric ratio under argon atmosphere in a water - cooled copper crucible .",

    "notably , the change of the @xmath30 axis parameter is much larger ( about 7 % from cept@xmath0b to cept@xmath0si ) than the @xmath29 axis parameter ( less than 2 % ) , which would indicate some anisotropy of this chemically exerted pressure .",

    "while there is some variation of the absolute values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 derived from different techniques , overall we find a continuous transformation of the antiferromagnetic phase in cept@xmath0b into that of cept@xmath0si , with a smooth suppression of ordering temperatures .",

    "the magnetic phase diagram has to be discussed in context with the evolution of the other physical parameters of the alloying series cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
    "the suppression of magnetic order is accompanied by a significant enhancement of electronic correlations , as evidenced by the increasing electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath80 .",
    "qualitatively , this behavior can be discussed within the concept of the doniach phase diagram , which considers the competition of long range magnetic order from an rkky - like exchange and the kondo effect.@xcite here , the basic idea is that there is a difference in the dependence on the magnetic coupling strength @xmath94 of the characteristic energy scales of the rkky - exchange , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 density of states at the fermi energy ) , and the kondo energy , @xmath97 $ ] .",
    "for comparatively small @xmath94 values the rkky - exchange dominates , causing magnetically ordered local moment states to occur .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath94 values the kondo screening will prevail , and long - range order will be suppressed .    the resistivity and the @xmath37 dependence of the curie - weiss temperature indicate that for both cept@xmath0b and cept@xmath0si the kondo energy scale is of the order 10k , and increases with @xmath37 by about a factor of two .",
    "further , the curie - weiss temperature @xmath98 indicates that the basic magnetic energy scale @xmath99 is slightly larger than @xmath60 ( 25 to 45k ) and which increases with @xmath37 , too . in result , with replacing b by si in cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 a doniach - like phase diagram is traversed , starting with the local moment magnet cept@xmath0b . for increasing si content",
    "@xmath37 the kondo effect is enhanced and tends to win over magnetic order , with the end point of the heavy fermion antiferromagnetic superconductor cept@xmath0si .",
    "commonly , such doniach - like phase diagrams are observed in pressure experiments or in isoelectronic chemical pressure studies . in our case ,",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated .",
    "chemically a negative pressure is exerted in the alloying series cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 with a large increase of the lattice parameters with @xmath37 .",
    "the negative pressure effect is also corroborated by the observation of a decreasing crystal field splitting with @xmath37 .",
    "this negative pressure , however , appears to be counteracted by the increasing electron count while replacing b by si .",
    "adding one conduction electron might lead to a small shift of the fermi energy , thus affect the density of states at the fermi level , @xmath100 .",
    "however , as first approximation the replacement of b by si is often considered to not significantly change band structure properties.@xcite these elements only produce flat and broad bands at the fermi level , and which should not be of great relevance to the magnetic properties of the materials . in consequence , as result of our experimental study , cept@xmath0b appears to represent a low pressure variant of cept@xmath0si .",
    "in fact , pressure experiments carried out so far on cept@xmath0b are broadly consistent with this statement.@xcite here , for pressure up to 1.85gpa only a slight increase of @xmath20 by about 10% is observed , without qualitative changes to the character of the magnetic ground state . within the concept of the doniach model , this observation would reflect that cept@xmath0b is still deep in the local moment region of the doniach phase diagram , and that a much larger pressure would be required to drive the system into the range of strong electronic correlations and close to a magnetic instability .",
    "consequently , it would be very interesting to see if the properties of cept@xmath0b under very high pressure resemble those of cept@xmath0si , and in particular if the system becomes superconducting .",
    "there are a couple of further points to be considered in context with the phase diagram of cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 .",
    "first , there is the non - observation of superconductivity for cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 , @xmath101 , down to 0.3k . strictly speaking , to ultimately settle this experimental case",
    ", it would be necessary to carry out experiments to lower temperatures ( @xmath102he/@xmath103he ) as well as for samples cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 with values @xmath37 closer to 1 .",
    "conceptually , however , the rapid suppression of superconductivity by doping with non - magnetic elements is in line with the ideas and observations about unconventional superconductivity in general ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and in cept@xmath0si specifically.@xcite    secondly , there is the issue about the relationship between the antiferromagnetic states in cept@xmath0b and cept@xmath0si .",
    "based on our observations , we conclude that the simple antiferromagnetic structure of cept@xmath0si , with @xmath13 , evolves out of the antiferromagnetic phase of cept@xmath0b . for the latter compound",
    ", however , it has been demonstrated that the afm structure does not consist of a @xmath13 ordering,@xcite but instead possesses a different ( possibly rather complex ) magnetic structure .",
    "the question arises , if there is a continuous transformation of the magnetic structure in cept@xmath0b into that of cept@xmath0si , or if it is instantaneous , and how this does affect the magnetic fluctuation spectrum .",
    "this , in turn , might be of relevance to the issue of the coupling mechanism of unconventional superconductivity in cept@xmath0si .",
    "similarly , the suppression of weak ferromagnetism with @xmath37 might be associated to modifications of the magnetic fluctuation spectrum relevant to superconductivity .",

    "<S> we present a study of the main bulk properties ( susceptibility , magnetization , resistivity and specific heat ) of cept@xmath0b@xmath1si@xmath2 , an alloying system that crystallizes in a noncentrosymmetric lattice , and derive the magnetic phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the materials at the end point of the alloying series have previously been studied , with cept@xmath0b established as a material with two different magnetic phases at low temperatures ( antiferromagnetic below @xmath3k , weakly ferromagnetic below @xmath4k ) , while cept@xmath0si is a heavy fermion superconductor ( @xmath5k ) coexisting with antiferromagnetism ( @xmath6k ) . from our experiments we conclude that the magnetic phase diagram is divided into two regions . in the region of low si content ( up to @xmath7 ) the material properties resemble those of cept@xmath0b . upon increasing the si concentration </S>",
    "<S> further the magnetic ground state continuously transforms into that of cept@xmath0si . </S>",
    "<S> in essence , we argue that cept@xmath0b can be understood as a low pressure variant of cept@xmath0si . </S>"
