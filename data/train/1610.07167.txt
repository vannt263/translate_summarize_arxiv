    "we will study the entropy spectrum of lyapunov exponents , that is , the topological entropy of level sets of points with a common given lyapunov exponent .",
    "this subject forms part of the multifractal analysis which , in general , studies thermodynamical quantities and objects ( such as , for example , equilibrium states , entropies , lyapunov exponents , birkhoff averages , and recurrence rates ) and their relations with geometrical properties ( for example , fractal dimensions ) .",
    "those properties are often encoded by the topological pressure .    in the uniformly hyperbolic context multifractal analysis",
    "is understood in great depth and has found already far reaching applications .",
    "there is a huge literature on this subject . to highlight a collection of results in the field at different stages of development ,",
    "we refer , for example , to @xcite ( analyticity of pressure and its consequences ) , @xcite ( multifractal analysis for conformal expanding maps and smale s horsehoes ) , and @xcite ( mixed spectra and restricted variational principles ) . in many of those references",
    ", particular attention is drawn to so - called geometric potentials because of their close relation to lyapunov exponents , entropy , and srb measures .",
    "two key properties of uniformly hyperbolic systems , under which the classical context of multifractal analysis was developed so far , are the specification property ( studied for example in  @xcite ) and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium states .",
    "the multifractal analysis theory extends also to ",
    "one - sided \" nonuniformly hyperbolic systems , that is , for example to nonuniformly expanding maps where the presence of a nonpositive lyapunov exponent is the only obstruction to hyperbolicity , that is , the spectrum of lyapunov exponents covers a range of hyperbolicity and the zero exponent bounds this range from one side , see for example @xcite ( expansive markov maps of the interval ) and @xcite ( multimodal interval maps ) .",
    "so far , there is not much understanding of a multifractal analysis for more complicated types of nonhyperbolic systems .",
    "it is difficult to describe all the situations that can happen in general ; one natural class of systems to focus on could be the systems with a designated line field ( associated with the oseledets decomposition ) for which the lyapunov exponent takes both positive and negative values arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "naturally , we assume topological transitivity , hence the system in question can not split into  one - sided \" nonuniformly hyperbolic parts .    probably , the simplest setting of such a  two - sided \" nonhyperbolic dynamical system is a step skew - product with a hyperbolic horseshoe map in its base and circle diffeomorphisms in its fibres .",
    "the nonuniform hyperbolicity arises from the coexistence of contracting and expanding regions which are blended by the dynamics .",
    "the system exhibits ergodic measures which positive and negative fiber lyapunov exponents .",
    "an important feature is the occurrence of ergodic _ nonhyperbolic measures _",
    "( i.e. , with zero lyapunov exponent ) with positive entropy .",
    "the considered dynamics is topologically transitive and simultaneously has  horseshoes \" which are contracting and  horseshoes \" which are expanding in the fiber direction .",
    "moreover , these horseshoes are intermingled and there coexist dense sets of periodic points with negative and positive fiber lyapunov exponents . the precise setting",
    "is discussed in section  [ sec : preli ] .",
    "the present paper is a continuation of  @xcite where properties of the space of invariant measures were investigated . here",
    "we will concentrate on the multifractal analysis of the entropy of the level sets of fiber lyapunov exponents .",
    "we follow a thermodynamic approach based on a restricted variational principle .",
    "the philosophy is that to obtain relevant multifractal information about the respective class of exponents one should not consider the whole variational - topological pressure , but instead its restrictions to ergodic measures with corresponding exponents , so - called _ restricted pressures_. the use of restricted ( sometimes also called _ hidden _ )",
    "pressures was initiated in  @xcite ( for rational maps of the riemann sphere ) and subsequently used , for example , in  @xcite ( for non - exceptional rational maps ) and @xcite ( for multimodal interval maps ) .",
    "as the difficulty in our setting comes from the coexistence of negative , zero , and positive fiber lyapunov exponents and as zero exponent measure are notoriously difficult to analyze , a natural solution is to consider the restricted pressures defined on the ergodic measures with negative and positive exponents , respectively ( it turns out that zero exponent ergodic measures do not play a significant role ) . this approach is made possible by the fact that the uniformly hyperbolic subsystems with negative / positive lyapunov exponents ( but not the system as the whole ) satisfy the specification property .    summarizing our results :",

    "we combine a thermodynamical and an orbitwise approach . on the one hand , we study the restricted variational pressure functions and extract properties from its shape . here , one of the big selling points of this approach is that it gives us convexity for free , which turns out to be a surprisingly useful property . on the one hand , in our approach we put our hands on the orbits of the level sets ( the amount of their entropy provides explicit information about them ) , using natural recurrence properties of the systems ( which is guided by the concept of so - called blending intervals in @xcite ) , and follow the  orbit - gluing approach \" ( which lead us to the notion of skeletons of the dynamics in @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that we always work in the lowest possible regularity and consider @xmath2 circle diffeomorphisms as fiber maps .",
    "let us return to the discussion of the zero lyapunov exponent .",
    "the greatest obstacle in our investigation , as usual in the study of nonhyperbolic systems , are points and measures with zero exponent . while for nonzero exponents we can give the full description of the lyapunov exponent level sets , including the restricted variational principle and the exact formula for their entropy , we have very restricted tools for studying the zero exponent level set @xmath11 .",
    "we are able to describe the entropy of this set , but the restricted variational principle can not be obtained by our methods .",
    "let us observe that the fact that @xmath12 has positive topological entropy was obtained in a similar context in @xcite by proving the existence of ergodic measures with positive entropy and zero exponents . in this paper",
    "this property is obtained as a surprising consequence of the shape of the pressure map . though positive , we also show that the topological entropy of @xmath11 is strictly smaller than the maximal , that is , the topological entropy of the system .",
    "the systems we study always have ( at least ) two hyperbolic ergodic measure of maximal entropy , one with negative and one with positive fiber lyapunov exponent .",
    "indeed , this is an immediate consequence of @xcite , obtained from a different point of view of our system as a random dynamical system , that is , as a product of independent and identically distributed circle diffeomorphisms , also observing the fundamental fact that our hypotheses exclude the case that our system is a rotation extension of a bernoulli shift .",
    "it is a particular case of a result in a more general setting  @xcite , stated for accessible partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms having compact center leaves , see also  @xcite . under the additional assumption of proximality , with",
    "@xcite we even can conclude uniqueness of ergodic measure of maximal entropy with negative and positive exponents .",
    "finally , we point out that the systems that we study are models for robustly transitive and nonhyperbolic diffeomorphisms and sets with compact central leaves  @xcite . from another point of view , which in fact provides some of our tools , the systems can be also considered as actions of a group of diffeomorphisms on the circle or as random dynamical systems .",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath1 , be the usual shift map on the space @xmath14 of two - sided sequences .",

    "accordingly , we split the set of all _ ergodic _ measures and consider the decomposition @xmath36 into measures with negative , zero , and positive fiber lyapunov exponent , respectively . in our setting , each component is nonempty . in general",
    ", it is very difficult to determine which type of hyperbolicity `` prevails '' .",
    "for that we will study the spectrum of possible exponents and will perform a multifractal analysis of the topological entropy of level sets of equal ( fiber ) lyapunov exponent .    to be more precise ,",
