    "an area of active interest is to engineer non - trivial quantum states of the harmonic oscillator through a controlled manipulation of the two - level systems with which it interacts .",

    "the transitions in the internal state of each ion are accompanied by changes in the vibrational state of a particular normal mode @xcite .",

    "several non - classical states have been prepared experimentally and fully characterized by quantum state tomography , including fock states , superpositions of fock states , schrdinger cat states and squeezed vacuum states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the decoherence of these states has been investigated by using specially engineered reservoirs @xcite . however , despite several promising theoretical proposals for their generation , to date , motional fock states have only been successfully created by applying a sequence of rabi @xmath0-pulses  tuned to the blue- and red - sidebands for a single ion @xcite . while this approach is conceptually simple ,",

    "the approach has several significant advantages over existing proposals , namely : ( i ) it is simple to implement , since only a single laser pulse is required ; ( ii ) the state preparation is very fast , since it occurs in a single step ; ( iii ) because there is only a very limited time for decoherence , the overall fidelity can be high ; ( iv ) our technique is naturally robust against fluctuations in the laser rabi frequency and detuning , since it utilises adiabatic passage ; ( v ) the technique holds up even when the first - order lamb - dicke approximation begins to break down .",

    ", the characteristic pulse width for our global - addressing technique is therefore [ t_global ] t = = .",
    "the total interaction time for a sech pulse can be taken as @xmath134 .    in order to estimate deleterious effects of heating on our scheme , we assume @xmath135 .",
    "this is the reasonable maximal value of the coupling ( implying minimal pulse duration ) , for which no extraneous excitations in other vibrational modes are created @xcite and the rotating - wave approximation is satisfied .",
    "is enough to satisfy the rotating - wave approximation in this case ( see e.g. @xcite ) . ] for a trap frequency of as in @xcite , we find that total interaction time of @xmath136s is sufficient for 0.9999 fidelity ( @xmath137 ) for @xmath138 ions . with a heating rate per ion of approximately 5 phonon / sec @xcite",
    ", we predict heating of about @xmath139 phonons in total .",
    "decoherence effects may be further reduced by using a higher - order vibrational mode with a lower heating rate , if each ion is addressed individually , i.e. , @xmath140.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each individual coupling strength , @xmath141 now contains the dimensionless factor @xmath22 defined in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian_full ] ) @xcite . by tuning the relative amplitude of each individual laser appropriately ,",
    "it is possible to produce the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .      alternatively , as a trade - off between the technical simplicity of using a single laser pulse and the low heating rates afforded by higher - order modes",
    ", one can use a single ion repeatedly instead of @xmath1 ions in a single step ; then phonons can be added or subtracted sequentially instead of all in one step . in this case , the difference between addressing one out of a chain of @xmath1 ions ( fig .",
    "[ three_approaches]c ) and a single trapped ion ( fig .",
    "[ three_approaches]d ) is the heating rate , which scales linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "below , for clarity , we consider the approach involving one ion from a chain of @xmath1 ions ( fig .",
    "[ three_approaches]c ) , and compare this to the global addressing technique discussed in subsection [ global_heating ] ( fig .",
    "[ three_approaches]a ) .",
    "the advantages of using a single ion are the lower heating rates of higher - order modes , and the use of a single laser .",
    "it also permits the creation of number states of arbitrary phonon number , rather than in multiples of the total number of ions .",
    "however , we stress that the single - ion multiple - step scenario requires a significantly higher fidelity in each step , @xmath142 instead of @xmath74 , for the global - addressing technique presented here .",
    "this higher fidelity requires larger pulse duration for a fixed peak rabi frequency .",
    "the characteristic pulse width for a repeated - local - addressing technique with a single ion requires @xmath1 steps with an @xmath1 times lower error [ cf .",
    "eq .  ] , [ t_local ]",
    "the total interaction time for a sech pulse is again @xmath143 .",
    "the single - ion implementation therefore requires longer time than the global - addressing technique , by a factor of @xmath144 .",
    "for example , for @xmath145 and @xmath138 ions , this factor is about 1.5 . therefore the number of heating events during the preparation of the fock states increases by the same factor .",
    "in summary , our global - addressing technique allows for a shorter time duration than single - ion techniques , and in addition , offers an appealing simplicity of implementation , with the need to engineer a single interaction only .    finally , we consider the preparation of motional states of a single ion , as shown in fig .",
    "[ three_approaches]d , whereby a sequence of adiabatic pulses can be applied to add or remove phonons one at a time . in this respect",
    "the proposal is similar to earlier work involving single ions , such as @xcite which used sequential pulses of precise area .",
    "however , our method possesses a significant advantage over previous work ",
    "namely a natural robustness with respect to experimental imperfections .",
    "this robustness arises from the adiabaticity of the process , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ section_fock ] , and should allow a significant increase in the fidelity of the preparation procedure .",
    "we have shown how vibrational fock states of a trapped - ion chain can be produced in a single step and using a single laser pulse .",
    "this is achieved by sweeping the laser frequency through resonance with a motional - sideband of the centre - of - mass vibrational mode .",
    "the key theoretical ingredient of our proposal is a particular choice of basis states in which to analyse the problem ( the generalized morris - shore basis ) , wherein the hilbert space factorizes into a collection of independent ladders .",
    "sweeping the laser detuning through resonance induces a ` bow - tie ' multiple - level crossing . with the proviso that the pulse area and detuning satisfy an adiabaticity condition",
    ", this pulse connects the lowest and highest levels of each ladder .",
    "moreover , the zero - phonon and @xmath1-phonon fock states are located at the opposite ends of the longest chain , which provides an extremely simple recipe for creating phonon fock states in a single step .",
    "since the state preparation takes place adiabatically , it is naturally robust against fluctuations in the experimental parameters , such as the laser detuning and chirp , the rabi frequency , and the pulse duration .",
    "numerical simulations show that the technique also performs well on the boundary of the lamb - dicke regime .",
    "our technique may also be used to prepare ghz states of the ions internal degrees of freedom and superpositions of motional fock states of the whole chain .",
    "we estimate that the fidelity of each step could be over @xmath116 for an eight - phonon fock state if the centre - of - mass mode and a single laser pulse are used , and we have also suggested several ways in which heating effects could be further reduced .",
