    "planets are believed to be formed out of dust grains that collide and accrete into larger and larger bodies in the gaseous protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) @xcite .",
    "the remarkable growth of dust into planets covers 40 orders of magnitude in mass , and can be divided into three regimes . at centimeter size or less , chemical bond and electrostatic forces allow small dust grains to stick to each other to form larger aggregates @xcite . at kilometer or larger sizes ( i.e. , planetesimals and larger bodies ) , gravity is strong enough to retain collision fragments , leading to the formation of planetary embryos / cores @xcite , and ultimately to terrestrial and giant planets @xcite .",
    "the intermediate size range lies in the regime of planetesimal formation .",
    "this is probably the least understood process in planet formation , largely because of solid growth in this regime is subject to a bottleneck known as the  meter size barrier \" .    in the intermediate size range ,",
    "aerodynamic coupling between gas and solids is important .",
    "the gaseous disk is partially supported by a radial pressure gradient , and rotates at sub - keplerian velocity , while solid bodies tend to orbit at keplerian velocity . consequently",
    ", solid bodies feel a headwind and drift radially inwards due to gas drag .",
    "the infall time scale is of the order @xmath6 years for meter - sized bodies @xcite , which poses strong constraint on the timescale of planetesimal formation .",
    "moreover , the collision velocity between meter sized boulders and other bodies is large enough to result in bouncing or fragmentation @xcite , rather than growth . to overcome the meter size barrier , collective effects that form planetesimals out of meter sized or smaller bodies appear to be essential .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed the turbulent concentration of chondrule sized particulates by factors of up to @xmath7 by extrapolating experimental results to high reynolds numbers .",
    "it such dense regions , mutual gravity of the particulates as a whole can overcome ram pressure and draw them together to form planetesimals @xcite , although the intermittency in the turbulence might work against particle concentration @xcite .",
    "one favorable model of planetesimal formation involves gravitational instability ( gi ) in the settled dust layer in the midplane of ppds @xcite . in the absence of turbulence in the disk ,",
    "the dust layer would become thinner and thinner until gi sets in and leads to formation of planetesimals by gravitational collapse and fragmentation .",
    "however , as first pointed out by @xcite , turbulence generated by vertical shear across the midplane dust layer ( via the kelvin - helmholtz instability , hereafter khi ) prevents dust grains from continuously settling well before gi is able to operate .",
    "based on the classical criterion for the onset of the khi and solar metalicity for height - integrated dust to gas mass ratio ( hereafter , solid abundance , denoted by z ) , the maximum solid density in disk midplane was found to be generally 1 - 2 orders of magnitude lower than the roche density for the onset of gi @xcite .",
    "inclusion of coriolis force @xcite as well as radial shear @xcite do not alter the conclusion qualitatively .",
    "it appears that increasing the local solid abundance by a factor of 2 - 10 times solar is needed for this mechanism to operate .",
    "this factor may be achievable by photoevaporation of gas @xcite , and by the radial variations of orbital drift speeds induced by gas drag @xcite .",
    "an important ingredient of particle - gas interaction in the midplane solid layer is the backreaction from particles to the gas .",
    "the momentum feedback from solids to gas is responsible for khi which tends to maintain a finite thickness of the solid layer .",
    "when the solids are not too strongly coupled to the gas , the backreaction leads to a powerful drag instability @xcite , now termed the  streaming instability \" ( hereafter si , @xcite ) .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the si is that it very efficiently concentrates particles into dense clumps @xcite , and enhances local particle density by a factor of up to @xmath8 .",
    "such enhancement in particle density is sufficient to trigger gi , and @xcite found in their simulations that planetesimals form rapidly once self - gravity is turned on .",
    "the sizes of the planetesimals formed in the simulations are about a few hundreds kilometers , consistent with constraints deduced from observations of asteroid and kuiper belt objects that planetesimals are formed big @xcite .",
    "these results provide a very promising path for forming planetesimals by si followed by gravitational collapse .",
    "planetesimal formation is also affected by external turbulence in ppds .",
    "the typical mass accretion rate of @xmath9yr@xmath10 for t - tauri stars @xcite indicates efficient angular momentum transport in ppds .",
    "magnetic field seems certain to play a crucial role in the transport process , most noticeably by the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "the turbulence generated by mri strongly affect the settling of small dust grains @xcite , but more interestingly , it promotes the concentration of decimeter to meter sized bodies @xcite .",
    "ppds are , however , only weakly ionized .",
    "the main ionization sources such as cosmic rays and x - rays from the protostar only ionize the surface of the disk , making the surface layers  active \" to mri driven turbulence , while the midplane remains poorly ionized and  dead \" @xcite .",
    "accretion is therefore layered and mainly proceeds in the active zone .",
    "moreover , the presence of small dust grains substantially increases disk resistivity and reduces the extent of the active layer @xcite .",
    "these non - ideal mhd effects due to partial ionization and dust resistivity , as well as the layered accretion structure in ppds tremendously complicate the story of planetesimal formation .    in this paper , we consider a _",
    "local _ patch of ppds and study the dynamics of gas and solids in the disk midplane .",
    "we perform shearing box hybrid simulations with both gas and particles using the athena code @xcite .",
    "the implementation of the particle module and code tests are presented in @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of backreaction from particles to gas allows us to investigate both the si and khi simultaneously .",
    "the local model is necessary for studying si because the scale of particle clumping is much smaller than gas scale height and requires at least @xmath11 cells to be properly resolved @xcite .",
    "the self - gravity from particles is neglected .",
    "although self - gravity will ultimately play an important role in planetesimal formation , our focus is its precursor : clumping of particles . neglecting self - gravity also has the advantage that our results can be easily scaled to different disk parameters and have very broad applications ( see  [ ssec : scaling ] ) .",
    "we have also neglected the thermodynamics in our work , which may affect the buoyancy of the gas , but the dynamics of the particles are generally unaffected @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal is to build the most realistic _ local _ model of ppds possible , including all of the non - ideal mhd effects as well as dust grains / solid bodies in a self - consistent manner . in this paper , however , we focus on the dynamics in the dead zone , and therefore can neglect mhd .",
    "this simplification is justified in two ways .",
    "first , conductivity calculations have shown that the inner part of ppds ( @xmath12au ) almost always contains a dead zone @xcite .",
    "second , this approach separates the hydrodynamic effects ( si ) from non - ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) effects , which sets the foundation for more sophisticated work . in reality",
    ", the dynamics in the dead zone can be affected by the turbulence in the active layer @xcite .",
    "for example , the gas motion in the disk midplane may exhibit strong low - frequency ( compared with orbital frequency @xmath2 ) vertical oscillations excited by the turbulence in the upper layer , and no coherent anti - cyclic vortices are found @xcite .",
    "its influence to the dynamics of the solids is not clear and is left for future investigations .",
    "an important ingredient of our simulations is the size distribution of particles . a wide size distribution of dust grains from micron to millimeter or centimeter size in the ppds",
    "is routinely deduced from the modeling of their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of dust coagulation also result in a broad range of particle sizes @xcite . in the most recent work that incorporates up - to - date laboratory collision experiment results @xcite , the particle size range that dominates the total solid mass spans about 1 - 3 magnitude , typically from sub - millimeter to decimeter range .",
    "we note that although @xcite also considered a size distribution of particles , their particle size is relatively large and the size range is narrow ( maximum particle size is 4 times the smallest ) . in this paper , we choose the particle size range to span 1 - 3 orders of magnitude , and we assume uniform particle mass distribution in logarithmic size bins .",
    "our choice of the particle size distribution roughly agrees with outcome of coagulation model calculations and serves as a first approximation of reality .",
    "we perform a parameter survey on particle size range and height - integrated particle to gas mass ratio ( or solid abundance ) that cover a substantial fraction of parameter space relevant to planetesimal formation .",
    "these simulations self - consistently include the mutual interactions between gas and particles of all sizes ( extending the early analytical work by @xcite who assumed all particles are passive ) , and will help us better understand the environment and precursor of planetesimal formation .",
    "we perform both two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulations , where the 2d simulations are axisymmetric ( i.e. , in the radial - vertical plane ) .",
    "we note that khi is most prominent in the azimuthal - vertical plane @xcite , although fully capturing khi requires fully 3d simulations including radial shear @xcite . on the other hand , 2d simulation in the radial - vertical plane",
    "is sufficient to capture si @xcite .",
    "while 3d simulations are necessary to capture all possible physical effects in the disk midplane layer , we show in  [ ssec : khisi ] that khi is unlikely to be present in all our 3d simulations , because the turbulence generated by si is strong enough to prevent the particles from further settling to trigger khi .",
    "therefore , 2d simulations are also a valid approach to the problem , and are much less time - consuming than the corresponding 3d runs . moreover , comparison between 2d and 3d simulations can be used for discerning multi - dimension effects , and as a guidance for future studies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : setup ] , we describe our simulation method , model parameters and scaling relations .",
    "we also describe the basic properties of the saturated state in all our simulations .",
    "we study various aspects of our simulations in the subsequent four sections . in  [",
    "sec : vertical ] we discuss the vertical structure of the particle layer . in particular , we address the question of what is the dominant process of the midplane dynamics , khi or si ?",
    "we further analyze which particles are actively participating in the instabilities , and which particles behave only passively . in  [",
    "sec : clumping ] we study the conditions for forming dense clumps from the si , which preludes planetesimal formation .",
    "the composition and dynamics of the dense clumps is also analyzed .",
    " [ sec : radial ] deals with the radial transport of particles , including both radial drift and radial diffusion .",
    "we study particle collision velocities in  [ sec : collision ] .",
    "we conclude our paper in  [ sec : discussion ] by summarizing our results and discussing various implications for planetesimal formation .",
    "in particular , we summarize the logical connections between various physical effects that may enhance each other and promote planetesimal formation .",
    "we consider local ppd models and formulate the equations of gas and solids using the shearing sheet approximation @xcite .",
    "we choose a local reference frame located at a fiducial radius , corotating at the keplerian angular velocity @xmath2 .",

    "the last term in the momentum equation represents the backreaction ( or momentum feedback ) from particles to gas : @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the local mass density and velocity of particles of type @xmath20 . in this paper",
    "we neglect the effect of magnetic fields and focus on the interaction between gas and solids in the dead zone of ppds @xcite .",
    "an isothermal equation of state for the gas is used throughout this paper , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the isothermal sound speed .    similarly ,",
    "the equation of motion for particle @xmath17 of type @xmath20 can be written as @xmath27 in the above equation , we have added an inward force term @xmath28 to mimic the effect of an outward radial pressure gradient in the gas @xcite , where @xmath29 is the difference between gas velocity and the keplerian velocity in the absence of particles . this term will shift both gas and particle azimuthal velocities by @xmath29 relative to those in the real system . to avoid confusion , we always use @xmath30 and @xmath31 to denote velocities that corresponds to the real system ( i.e. , subtracting the azimuthal velocity component from the simulation by @xmath29 ) .",
    "particle self - gravity is ignored as we focus on the dynamics in the midplane of the ppd dead zone and precursor of the planetesimal formation .    in our simulations , we have applied an orbital advection algorithm for both gas and particles @xcite , and the actual velocities used in the simulation are measured relative to the linearized keplerian shear flow : @xmath32 for gas flow , and @xmath33 for individual particles .",
    "measuring velocities in units of the sound speed , time in units of @xmath34 , and length in units of the gas scale height @xmath35 , the parameters in the problem are reduced to the following :    1 .",
    "the dimensionless particle stopping time @xmath36 for particle species @xmath20 .",
    "2 .   the solid abundance parameter @xmath37 for each particle species , which measures the height - integrated particle to gas mass ratio .",
    "3 .   the parameter characterizing the strength of the radial pressure gradient @xmath38 .",
    "below , we apply a disk model and provide the scaling relation between the disk model parameters and these dimensionless parameters used in our simulation .",
    "we adopt a generalized solar nebular model where the disk is vertically isothermal and all the disk quantities have a power law dependence on the radius @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the gas surface mass density , @xmath41 is the disk temperature , @xmath42 is the mass of the central star , and @xmath43au .",
    "these parameters fix the disk model .",
    "although the global disk profile may not follow the simple power law form , we can always approximate a local patch of the disk in the above form , which is very general .",
    "in the standard minimum - mass solar nebular ( mmsn ) model @xcite , we have @xmath44 .",
    "the radial profiles of other physical quantities are @xmath45 where in the calculation of the sound speed , we assume the mean molecular weight @xmath46 .    the background gas density profile is @xmath47 where subscript  @xmath48 \" denotes  background \" . using this gas density and sound speed",
    ", one can derive the radial pressure gradient in the gaseous disk , thus obtain the amount of reduction @xmath29 in the gas rotation velocity .",
    "after some algebra , we can derive the pressure length scale parameter @xmath49 note that @xmath50 depends on both radius and height .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper , our simulation box is concentrated in the disk midplane where @xmath51 , therefore we can neglect the dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath53 . in the last equation of the above formula",
    ", we have applied the power law indices of the mmsn model .",
    "the dependence on disk temperature @xmath54 , stellar mass @xmath55 as well as disk radius @xmath56 is relatively weak .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the dependence of @xmath52 on disk mass is only through the surface density profile parameter @xmath48 , free from the scaling parameter @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , the value @xmath58 should apply to a wide range of disk models .",
    "next we consider the scaling relations for the dimensionless stopping time .",
    "because the gas motion in ppds is expected to be subsonic , the relevant drag laws from the gas to the solids in ppds are the epstein drag law @xcite , which applies when particle size is smaller than the gas mean free path , and the stokes drag law , which applies for larger bodies .",
    "we assume all solid bodies have spherical shapes , then the stopping time in these two regimes can be expressed as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 g @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the density and radius of the solid body , @xmath63 is the mean free path of the gas , and @xmath64@xmath65 is the molecular collision cross section @xcite . from the above equations , we see that the particle stopping time depends linearly on gas density in the epstein regime .",
    "nevertheless , the gas density can be regarded as constant near the disk midplane where we study .",
    "therefore , in our local simulations , we can safely take @xmath3 as depending on particle size @xmath62 only .    to better handle the relation between particle size and its corresponding stopping time",

    "radii , the epstein regime applies to much larger particles .",
    "fiducially , we consider the mmsn model at 1 au , and set the pressure length scale parameter @xmath70 .",
    "this parameter is kept fixed in all our simulations . instead of considering a particle size distribution in radius",
    ", we consider the distribution in @xmath71",
    ". then one can easily translate it into particle radius given the parameters of the disk model .",
    "we discretize a continuous particle size distribution into a number of bins .",
    "each bin covers half a dex in @xmath71 in the logarithmic scale . for simplicity , we assume a uniform particle mass distribution across the bins , that is , all the particle bins ( or particle species ) have equal amount of mass .",
    "the parameters for the size distribution is therefore the minimum and maximum dimensionless stopping time @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( translated to @xmath74 and @xmath75 respectively ) .",
    "physically , our assumption means that most of the mass of the solids resides in the size range between @xmath74 and @xmath75 and roughly follows a flat distribution in logarithmic scale . to control the total particle mass",
    ", we use the total solid abundance parameter @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the number of particle types ( bins ) .",
    "currently the best estimate of the solar metallicity is about @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "a substantial fraction of the metal elements may reside in dust grains and grow into larger bodies . in our simulations , we consider three abundance values @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this choice covers a relatively wide range of disk metallicities .",
    "moreover , because our simulation focuses on a local patch in a ppd , the local abundance may not necessarily be equal to the averaged value in the ppd .    as we explained in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , we perform simulations in both 2d and 3d .",
    "our 2d simulations are in the @xmath81-@xmath82 plane ( i.e. axisymmetric ) .",

    "azimuthal boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "vertical gravity is included in our simulations , and we choose reflection boundary condition in the @xmath82 direction , which is the same as that in @xcite . in general , we use 256 cells in the radial ( and azimuthal , if applicable ) direction .",
    "guided by @xcite , properly resolving the si with @xmath83 requires about @xmath84 cells per pressure length scale @xmath85 . with this required resolution , our simulation box size is typically small , spanning only about @xmath86 .",
    "such small box size is also necessary to capture the typical wavelength of the khi , if present @xcite . in our simulations",

    "larger @xmath90 are used when @xmath77 is smaller to keep the total number of particles similar in all our simulations .",
    "our choice of particle number guarantees at least one particle per cell per particle type around the disk midplane , as required for numerical convergence @xcite .    in our simulations",
    ", we set the initial particle density profile to be a gaussian centered on disk midplane with scale height @xmath91 for all particle types .",
    "the particle and gas velocities are computed from a multi - species nakagawa - sekiya - hayashi ( nsh ) equilibrium , where the classical single - species nsh equilibrium @xcite solution is generalized to include multiple species of particles ( see appendix [ app : nsh ] ) .",
    "note that different particles have different velocities , and the velocities of particles and gas depend on @xmath53 .",
    "the choice of our simulation box size and boundary conditions in the vertical direction merit further discussion . in the simulations , gas - particle interaction in the disk midplane generates turbulence and excites vertical motions in the gas .",
    "ideally the vertical box size should extend to a few @xmath92 , similar to what is used for mri simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however , this would make 3d simulations too expensive .",
    "we have conducted a series of tests in 2d with a single particle species @xmath1 using different vertical box sizes and either reflecting or periodic boundary conditions . in both cases ,",
    "particles settle to the disk midplane with a spatial distribution reminiscent of sinusoidal waves that slowly drift in the radial direction .",
    "we find that the particle scale height is more intermittent when using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , periodic boundary conditions appear to suppress asymmetric modes in the gas azimuthal velocity around the disk midplane . using reflecting boundary conditions , we find essentially no difference between the particle scale heights and clumping properties obtained from different vertical box sizes once the box height is much larger than the particle scale height , although it takes longer for the system to reach a quasi - steady state when a larger vertical box size is used .",
    "the drift velocities of the wave - like pattern of particles do differ when different vertical box sizes are used , but they are unlikely to affect the properties discussed in  [ sec : vertical ] to  [ sec : collision ] .. guided by these results , as long as the vertical boundary of our simulation box is well above the scale height of all particle species , one should get converged results from the simulations .",

    "to study the properties of turbulent diffusion , one approach would be to assume some functional form for the vertical profile of the diffusion coefficient @xmath113 , and fit the particle density profiles . however , after several experiments we found it difficult to fit the density profile of all particle species _ simultaneously _ with any simple functional form of @xmath113 .",

    ", we pose the question in another way : what is the effective vertical diffusion coefficient _ at the disk midplane _ for the particles that are driving the turbulence ? since we have identified the si as the source of the midplane turbulence , one expects particles with relatively large stopping times to drive the turbulence both from a theoretical point of view @xcite and from non - stratified simulations of si ( @xcite , bai & stone , unpublished ) . to address these questions more quantitatively , we find the following approach particularly useful .",
    "we fit the horizontally averaged vertical density profile of the largest particles @xmath117 in each simulation using the classical picture of turbulent diffusion . since these particles ( as well as particles with slightly smaller @xmath71 )",
    "actively drive the disk turbulence , the gas turbulent diffusion coefficient across this particle layer can be regarded as constant .",
    "therefore , the vertical density profile of these particles is expected to be gaussian , with scale height @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the turnover time of largest eddies . the basic assumption behind this formula is stochastic turbulent forcing on passive particles with the autocorrelation function of the turbulence @xmath120 , corresponding to a kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "we do not have much knowledge of @xmath121 for si turbulence , but expect it to be comparable to the orbital time ( the only time scale of the problem ) , and take @xmath122 .",
    "the exact value of @xmath123 does not matter much , since it only gives an order unity correction to @xmath124 .    by fitting the vertical density profile of the largest particles with a gaussian we obtain @xmath125 for all simulations , and the results",
    "are summarized in table [ tab : vertdiff ] . for 3d runs ,",
    "the results are also plotted in figure [ fig : profile3d ] as dashed lines .",
    "we see that the vertical profiles of the largest particles are well fitted with a gaussian .",
    "in addition , we predict the vertical density profile for other particle species , using equation ( [ eq : hp ] ) and assuming a diffusion coefficient which is constant with height . obviously , this will overpredict the scale heights for small particles , since they respond to the turbulence passively .",
    "however , for particles that actively participate in the instability , we expect their density profile to be comparable to the predicted profile , since they are driving turbulence to maintain @xmath126 close to @xmath125 across their scale heights . in this way , we are able to identify the particle species that are responsible for the disk turbulence ( hereafter termed as  active \" particles )",

    "this density enhancement further favors strong concentration of particles by si , which explains the trend we have observed in figure [ fig : dparmax ] .",
    "the particle clumping also depends on the particle size distribution . in the r41",

    "since khi is unlikely to be present in these simulations , the different results between our 2d and 3d simulations should be attributed to the different behavior of the si in 2d and 3d .",

    "the maximum particle density is already comparable with the roche density , and in this case we expect the formation of a few planetesimals from the simulations as in @xcite .",
    "particle concentration properties are known to depend on numerical resolution . to assess the validity of our results",
    ", we have also performed the same set of simulations with half our standard resolution .",
    "we find the same dichotomy between strong clumping and no clumping .",
    "the only exception is the r30z3 - 3d run : it shows strong particle clumping in the low - resolution run which does not dissolve as in our standard resolution run .",
    "the reason is that the turbulence generated from the lower resolution run is weaker , thus particles settle more which favors clumping .",
    "this test justifies the necessity of conducting high resolution simulations . in the mean time",

    "the cpdf measures the probability of a particle residing in a region with total particle density larger than @xmath169 . in figure",
    "[ fig : dparpdf ] , we plot the cpdfs of the three runs : r21z3 , r30z3 and r10z3 . at relatively high densities with @xmath170",
    ", we see that in all three cases , the dense regions are composed of particles with the largest stopping times . in run r21z3 - 2d",
    ", the mass fraction of different particle species in the dense clumps is increasing with particle stopping time @xmath71 , and is completely dominated by the largest particles @xmath83 . in the case of r30z3 - 2d and r10z3 - 2d , where the largest particles have @xmath171 , the composition of the clumps are dominated by the two largest particle species . contribution from other particle species to the clumps",
    "is almost negligible by mass .    for r21z3 and r30z3 runs",
    ", 3d simulations do not show particle clumping , therefore , the resulting cpdfs differ substantially from those in 2d runs .",
    "nevertheless , these cpdfs provide typical examples for simulations without clumping .",
    "the shapes of the cpdfs from different particles are very similar , and curves for larger particles are located to the right of those for smaller particles , consistent with the vertical stratification of particles . for run r10z3 - 3d , the particle clumping is stronger than the 2d case , and the densest clumps are almost equally made of particles with @xmath1 and @xmath172 .",
    "next , we consider the motion of the dense clumps . in figure",
    "[ fig : satpar ] , we mark the location of the densest point with a red dot in runs with strong particle clumping . by monitoring the location of the densest point with time",
    ", we find that it wanders slowly .",
    "another useful way of studying the dynamics of the clumps is by tracking the radial trajectories @xmath173 of a sample of particles .",
    "we relocate the particle positions when they cross the radial boundaries of our simulation box so that their trajectories are continuous . by tracing a large number of particles in the saturated state of our runs",
    ", we obtain the distribution of @xmath174 for each particle species at time interval @xmath175 . in figure",
    "[ fig : raddiffuse ] we show the probability distribution of @xmath174 for a number particle species from our run r10 - 3d .",
    "when @xmath110 , no particle clumping occurs .",
    "the distribution of @xmath174 is close to a gaussian ( or a parabola in logarithmic scale ) and the width increases with @xmath175 , consistent with undergoing a random walk .",
    "meanwhile , the center of the distribution drifts inward with time ( see  [ sec : radial ] for more discussion ) .",
    "however , when particle clumps are present , as in the @xmath111 case , the shape of the distribution deviates substantially from a gaussian , especially for particles that make up the clumps ( the largest particles , shown in the blue and green curves ) . for these clump - making particles",
    ", the width of particle distribution still increases with @xmath175 , as expected from turbulent diffusion , but a substantial fraction of theses particles stay nearly stationary without drifting ( near @xmath176 ) , making the resulting distribution more and more elongated with time .",
    "the leftmost location of the particle distribution moves inward with time , and is set by the radial drift velocity .",
    "more interestingly , we see almost evenly separated multiple peaks in the distribution function . in fact",
    ", the separation between these peaks equals the radial size of our simulation box .",
    "the physical picture becomes clear that the clumps stop some of the particles from drifting radially , and particles are kept in the clump for a few orbits or more before leaving for the next clump .",
    "similar behavior is observed for other runs with particle clumping .",
    "as expected from particle - gas equilibrium , particles experience head wind from the gas and drift radially inward . particles with different stopping times drift at different velocities . at the same time , the instabilities generated at the disk midplane diffuse the particles .",
    "these two processes transport particles radially in ppds , and is the subject of this section . in particular , we show that it is important to study the radial transport of particles by considering particles of all sizes simultaneously , rather than individually .",
    "we calculate the averaged radial drift velocities for each particle species from all our runs , and the results are shown in figure [ fig : raddrift ] . the measured mean drift velocities are shown in squares ( 2d ) and circles ( 3d ) .",
    "we have also plotted the @xmath177 limits for particle drift velocity based on the rms fluctuations , which are indicated in blue and red vertical bars . in the figure ,",
    "the velocities are normalized to @xmath29 .",
    "clearly , the radial drift velocity monotonically decreases with particle stopping time , and the drift is fastest for marginally coupled particles .",
    "the classical result on the radial drift of particles is the nsh equilibrium solution @xcite .",
    "it describes the equilibrium state between solids and gas in unstratified ( neglecting vertical gravity ) keplerian disks , where gas is partially supported by radial pressure gradient . in the nsh equilibrium ,",
    "the drift speed is given by @xmath178 we emphasize that the conventional nsh solution is obtained by considering a single species of solids .",
    "equation ( [ eq : singlensh ] ) does not simply generalize to the case with multiple - species of particles by replacing @xmath132 to @xmath23 for each particle species @xmath20 . in appendix",
    "[ app : nsh ] we provide the generalized formula for multi - species nsh equilibrium , and the solution involves evaluation of an inverse matrix of order @xmath179 .",
    "it reflects the fact that although different particle species do not interact directly with each other , they are indirectly coupled via their interactions with gas .    in figure",
    "[ fig : raddrift ] , the bold solid lines show the expected radial drift velocities from single - species nsh equilibrium .",
    "we see that there are large deviations from the measured mean drift velocities , with two notable features .",
    "first , for relatively large particles , the drift velocities are reduced from single - species nsh values .",
    "the reduction is strongest for runs with the largest @xmath5 .",
    "second , the smallest particles drift _ outward _ , rather than inward as expected from the single - species nsh solution .        to calculate the expected radial drift velocity from a multi - species equilibrium , we first use the particle density profiles extracted from ",
    "[ ssec : profile ] and calculate the drift velocity in each vertical bin .",
    "the drift velocity is then weighted by particle density in each bin to yield the mean drift velocity .",
    "the results are plotted in dashed and dash - dotted lines ( for 2d and 3d runs respectively ) in figure [ fig : raddrift ] .",
    "we see that these curves provide an excellent fit to the measured mean radial drift velocities in all simulations .",
    "in fact , the two features mentioned above are natural consequences of the multi - species solution . due to the sub - keplerian motion of the gas , particle drag increases gas angular momentum , leading to outward drift of gas . in the presence of both weakly coupled and strongly coupled particles , the strongly coupled particles are tied to the gas and therefore drift outward with the gas . marginally coupled particles still drift inward , but due to the influence of the smaller particles , these particles feel a weaker headwind ( i.e. , the gas azimuthal velocity is closer to the keplerian value ) , resulting in a smaller drift velocity compared with the single - species solution . with increasing @xmath5 , thus higher midplane particle density , the gas becomes more entrained by the solids , leading to stronger reduction of the drift velocity for large particles .",
    "the residuals from the multi - species nsh solution fit to the measured mean drift velocities are largest for particles with largest @xmath71 , likely due to their participation in si , and/or clumping . in the non - stratified simulation of @xcite , it was shown that in the saturated state of si , the radial drift velocity is either increased or decreased depending on run parameters . in our simulations , these effects are secondary compared with the multi - species effect .",
    "the measured drift velocities from 2d ( squares ) and 3d ( circles ) simulations generally agree with each other .",
    "the ( small ) differences can be attributed to the differences in the particle vertical density profiles .",
    "so far we have focused on the mean radial drift velocities . in the saturated state of our simulations ,",
    "the particle radial drift velocities follow a distribution , due to the si .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : raddrift ] that in most of the runs , the fluctuation level is about @xmath180 .",
    "this fact is closely related to the radial diffusion of particles discussed in the next subsection .",
    "based this observation , we can estimate the particle radial diffusion coefficient to be @xmath181 .",
    "the radial diffusion of particles is generally characterized by the radial diffusion coefficient @xmath182 . from our simulations",
    ", we can measure @xmath182 for different particle species based on the random walk model of particle diffusion .",
    "we calculate the distribution of shift in the particle radial position at various time intervals @xmath175 as in figure [ fig : raddiffuse ] , and measure the width ( rms ) of the distribution @xmath183 as a function of @xmath175 .",
    "the spreading due to a random walk results in an gaussian distribution , and @xmath183 is related to the diffusion coefficient by @xmath184 for each particle species , we measure @xmath185 for different @xmath175 , and fit the slope in of the @xmath186 curve by linear regression .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig : radmix ] .",
    "the range of the radial diffusion coefficient is consistent to within an order of magnitude of the estimate in the last subsection based on the spread of radial drift velocities .",
    "it is also comparable with the vertical diffusion coefficient at disk midplane estimated in ",
    "[ ssec : profile ] ( see table [ tab : vertdiff ] ) .",
    "below we discuss these results further .",
    "first , the above procedure for measuring the diffusion coefficient does not apply to runs that show strong particle clumping . as we see in figure [ fig : raddiffuse ] , the distribution of @xmath174 deviates strongly from a gaussian due to the influence of the clumps .",
    "the measured width of the distribution is about half the distance traveled by the fastest drifting particles ( those that are not confined in the clumps ) , and we observe that @xmath185 scales as @xmath187 rather than @xmath175 from our measurement .",
    "therefore , the measured @xmath182 from r21z3 - 2d , r30z3 - 2d and r10z3 ( both 2d and 3d ) runs for those clump making particles ( or the largest two particle species in the run ) is not valid . in figure",
    "[ fig : radmix ] , we see the measured @xmath182 for these particles have anomalously large values .",
    "such particles can reside in the disk for much longer than if there were no clumping .",
    "next , we discuss diffusion of non - clumping particles . in each simulation",
    "the measured @xmath182 generally approaches an asymptotic value for particles with @xmath188 , but is different between different particle species for particles with @xmath189 .",
    "this can be due to multiple reasons .",
    "first , similar to the vertical diffusion of particles , the radial diffusion coefficient also depends on the vertical position in the disk , and the radial diffusion in the disk midplane is expected to be the strongest .",
    "our measured @xmath182 can be considered as a vertically averaged quantity .",
    "therefore , @xmath182 is expected to be larger for particles with larger @xmath71 , since they stay closer to the midplane .",
    "this trend is observed in runs r41 and r21 .",
    "second , different particles react differently to the turbulence . in the case of kolmogorov turbulence ,",
    "the particle diffusivity scales as @xmath190 @xcite .",
    "this may be responsible for the decrease of @xmath182 towards @xmath1 in r30 and r10 runs with @xmath110 and @xmath158 .",
    "thirdly , different particles participate in the si in different ways ( i.e. , actively or passively ) .",
    "the si may strongly affect the transport properties of the active particles , with the extreme example being the clump - making particles discussed above . despite the different values of @xmath182 for different particle species",
    ", one may take the asymptotic value of @xmath182 as measured from the smallest particles as characteristic of the radial diffusion coefficient in the gas .",
    "these asymptotic values correlates with the vertical diffusion coefficient well ( see table [ tab : vertdiff ] ) .    to address the effectiveness of radial diffusion compared with radial drift , we denote the mean radial drift velocity to be @xmath191 , and the diffusion coefficient to be @xmath192 .",
    "after time @xmath193 , the ratio @xmath194 reflects the relative importance between radial drift and turbulent diffusion , where @xmath195 .",
    "diffusion is important when @xmath196 . from figure",
    "[ fig : raddrift ] , we see that for the largest particles , @xmath197 . from figure",
    "[ fig : radmix ] , we have @xmath198 .",
    "therefore , the effect of radial diffusion of particles becomes negligible compared with radial drift beyond @xmath199 orbital periods .",
    "again , this discussion does not apply to the situation when particle clumping is present , where large particles can be retained in the clumps and some of them may survive the radial drift .",
    "the initial stage for planetesimal formation is the growth of solid bodies by mutual collisions .",
    "the size distribution of particles in the ppds therefore depends on the outcome of two - body collisions , which further depends on the properties of the colliding particles ( e.g. , size and porosity ) and collision velocity .",
    "laboratory experiments show that at low collision velocities ( @xmath200m@xmath201s@xmath10 ) , collisions generally lead to sticking or bouncing .",
    "larger collision velocities tend to result in fragmentation ( see the review by @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , sticking can also occur with collision velocities up to @xmath202m@xmath201s@xmath10 in some regimes ( see figure 11 of @xcite ) .",
    "the particle size distributions used in this paper can be considered as a first approximation to the outcome of grain growth in ppds . in turn",
    ", we can measure the two - body collision velocity produced by the si from our simulations and investigate whether our selected particle size distribution is consistent with the outcome of collisional coagulation .",
    "we measure the relative speeds of all particle pairs within a distance @xmath203 in the saturated state of our simulation snapshots .",
    "these velocities form a representative sample of particle relative velocity distribution ( rvd ) in the vicinity of a tracer particle .",
    "we assume that particles that collide with this tracer particle would have the same rvd .",
    "the measured rvd depends somewhat on the choice of @xmath203 . in practice , we choose @xmath203 to be a quarter of a cell size , in order to reduce the ( misrepresented ) measured collision velocity between strongly coupled particles ( see figure [ fig : coll_mean ] and the discussion that follows ) , while maintaining good statistics . to obtain the distribution of collision velocities with a tracer particle , the rvd",
    "must be weighted by the relative velocity , since the collision frequency is enhanced at larger relative velocities .",
    "the corresponding cpdfs ( similar to  [ ssec : clumpcomp ] ) are shown and discussed in appendix [ app : collision ] . in this context , it measures the probability of a particle that undergoes collision with relative velocity greater than a given value .",
    "particle velocities are normalized to the gas sound speed @xmath26 in our simulations . in all the results presented in this section , we adopt @xmath204 km s@xmath10 , corresponding to the mmsn model at 1au .        in order to visualize the particle collision velocities in a compact way",
    ", we characterize the cpdfs by the median collision velocity ( at @xmath205 ) and its @xmath177 limits ( at @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : coll_mean ] we show the median collision velocities and @xmath177 limits for various pairs of particle species from all our 3d simulations .",
    "results from 2d simulations are generally similar , and are not plotted . to interpret these results , we consider two sources of the collision velocities : radial drift and turbulence .",
    "to calculate the contribution from radial drift , we evaluate the multi - species nsh equilibrium in each vertical cell bin @xmath208 ( @xmath209 ) , from which we obtain the relative radial drift velocity @xmath210 between each pair of particle types @xmath211 in that bin .",
    "the relative velocity is further weighted by collision frequency in that bin , proportional to @xmath212 . integrating over all the vertical bins , we obtain the expected collision velocity from radial drift , which is shown as solid curves in figure [ fig : coll_mean ] .",
    "we see that with the exception of run r10z3 - 3d , these curves fit the median collision velocities very well , meaning that relative radial drift is the dominant source of collision velocities .",
    "r10z3 - 3d is the only 3d run that shows strong particle clumping , and the measured median collision velocity is strongly reduced from our predictions .",
    "this is clearly seen in the cpdf plot ( see figure [ fig : coll_pdf ] in appendix [ app : collision ] ) .",
    "however , in these simulations , the median collision velocity no longer characterizes the overall collision velocities because the shapes of the cpdfs are strongly deformed due to the clumping .",
    "in fact , there is still a high - velocity tail in the cpdf of collision velocity , which reaches values as high as @xmath213 m s@xmath10 .",
    "this tail is most likely caused by collisions outside the clump , as indicated in figure [ fig : coll_dpar ] , and our predicted collision velocities should apply in these low density regions .",
    "the relative radial drift velocity can not account for the collision velocity between particles with the same stopping time ( therefore all solid curves reach a zero point in figure [ fig : coll_mean ] ) . to remedy this limitation",
    ", we further consider the contribution from turbulence .",
    "so far turbulence induced particle collision velocities has been studied theoretically only in the framework of passive particles in uniform kolmogorov turbulence @xcite , and in mri turbulence @xcite .",
    "we consider the closed form expression of turbulent collision velocities by @xcite , which is based on the kolmogorov spectrum . although these assumptions do not quite apply in our simulations , we adopt this approach as an approximate treatment of turbulence induced collision velocities .",
    "we use their equation ( 16 ) , and more specifically , we fix the turn over time for the smallest eddy to be @xmath214 , and take @xmath215 as an approximation ( where @xmath216 is the turn over time of the critical eddy with which the particle in question is marginally coupled ) . the turn over time of the largest eddy @xmath217 ,",
    "is considered as a fitting parameter is the same as @xmath121 defined in equation ( [ eq : hp ] ) , where the latter is set to @xmath34 for simplicity .",

    "we have experimented with choosing different @xmath203 in our calculations and found that the asymptotic value roughly scales linearly with @xmath203 when @xmath203 is less than grid size , because the gas velocity is not resolved at scales less than a grid cell . from figure",

    ".   si plays the dominant role in the dynamics of ppd midplane when the largest solids have stopping times @xmath4 .",
    "particles with @xmath4 actively participate in si , while smaller particles behave passively .",
    "khi is not observed in all our simulations , which suggests that it may be important only when all particles have @xmath188 .",
    "2 .   the strength of the turbulence generated by the si and the scale height of the particle layer are self - regulated .",
    "there exists some threshold solid abundance , above which increasing @xmath5 will result in weaker turbulence , which promotes particle settling , leading to rapid drop of the thickness of the particle layer and strong particle clumping .",
    "si can concentrate particles into dense clumps with solid density exceeding the roche density , which acts as the prelude of planetesimal formation .",
    "the particle clumping generally requires the presence of relatively large particles with @xmath4 .",
    "it also sensitively depends on solid abundance , in favor of super - solar metallicity .",
    "4 .   the dense particle clumps are mostly made of the largest particles with size range spanning less than one order of magnitude .",
    "these particles are trapped in the clumps for several orbital times before leaving the clumps , providing a way for large particles to survive radial drift .",
    "the mean radial drift velocity for each particle species agrees well with a multi - species nsh equilibrium solution ( see appendix a ) . strongly coupled particles drift outward , and the radial drift velocity for particles with larger @xmath71 is strongly reduced relative to the conventional single - species nsh value , especially at large @xmath5 .",
    "this can increase the lifetime of the largest particles by a factor of a few .",
    "turbulence generated by the si leads to radial diffusion of particles , but the diffusion is slow and its effect is negligible compared with radial drift after about @xmath199 orbital periods ( for the largest particles ) .",
    "particle clumping effectively enhances radial diffusion by retaining a fraction of large particles in the clumps .",
    "mutual collision velocity between @xmath4 particles is dominated by the difference in their radial drift velocities , and agrees well with calculations using the multi - species nsh equilibrium .",
    "the collision velocity is strongly reduced towards large disk metallicity relative to predictions from single - species nsh solution .",
    "collision velocity induced by si turbulence is only secondary .      in this subsection",
    "we combine the results summarized in the previous subsection and discuss various implications for planetesimal formation .",

    "see text for details .",
    ", width=302,height=340 ]      our simulations show a dichotomy in the parameter space in which strong particle clumping occurs .",
    "strong clumping requires the presence of relatively large particles with @xmath4 , and the abundance of these particles to be super - solar .",
    "these two requirements are represented by the two arrows connecting @xmath234 and  grain growth \" to  planetesimals \" in figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "these two requirements can compensate each other : to form planetesimals , less grain growth is required if the solid abundance is large enough . in the case that all solids are strongly coupled to the gas , enhancing the disk metallicity by a factor of 5 - 30 may be able to trigger gi followed by planetesimal formation @xcite .    the particle size that corresponds to @xmath235 depends on the disk model and distance from the central star . in the mmsn model , this stopping time corresponds to @xmath236 cm particles at 1au , and @xmath236 mm or smaller particles at 5au or beyond , according to equation ( [ eq : taus ] ) .",
    "these particle sizes are about the maximum particle size obtained in the recent dust coagulation calculations @xcite . for more massive disks , the corresponding particle size will be enlarged by a factor of @xmath57 in the epstein regime . since",
    "grain growth becomes more difficult when the particle size exceeds a millimeter , the si scenario of planetesimal formation prefers less massive disks , or the outer part of the disk .",
    "enrichment of the local abundance of solids is possible by several effects , already briefly mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "here we focus on the mechanism proposed by @xcite . for a particle at a fixed size ( small , with @xmath237 at all disk radii considered ) , the ( single - species ) nsh radial drift velocity in ppds decreases as the particle drifts inward .",
    "therefore , radial drift causes the particles to pile - up towards the inner regions , leading to enhancement of the local abundance of solids .",
    "depending on the time scale , the largest enhancement factor can reach @xmath238 in @xmath239 years @xcite , starting in the outer disk and moving inwards .",
    "this process corresponds to the arrow pointing from  radial pile - up \" to @xmath234 in figure [ fig : summary ] .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the radial drift velocity is reduced when local abundance of solids increases .",
    "this effect provides positive feedback to the enrichment process : particles pile up because the radial drift velocity is smaller at smaller disk radii .",
    "the enrichment of solid material at small disk radii further reduces the radial drift velocity , leading to stronger pile - ups .",
    "this effect corresponds to the arrow pointing from @xmath234 to  radial pile - up \" in figure [ fig : summary ] .",
    "we see that the enrichment of the abundance of solids and the particle pile - up form a feedback loop that enhance each other .",
    "therefore , we expect even stronger solid enrichment in the inner region of ppds than previous calculations @xcite sufficient for si and/or gi to form planetesimals within ppd dead zone .",
    "the radial drift velocity adopted in grain coagulation models ( e.g. , @xcite ) is generally taken from a single - species nsh equilibrium .",
    "however , we have shown that as particles settle to disk midplane , the radial drift velocity is reduced due to multi - species effects , and smallest particles can even drift outward rather than inward .",
    "more sophisticated modeling of grain growth is needed to incorporate the multi - species effects .",
    "one consequence of the multi - species nsh equilibrium is that the enhancement of local abundance of solids strongly reduces the radial drift velocity , hence the particle mutual collision velocity . because the radial drift velocity dominates the collision velocities for relatively large particles , we expect particles to grow larger in regions with large abundance of solids , due to the reduced collision velocity there .",
    "this effect is illustrated as an arrow pointing from @xmath234 to  grain growth \" in figure [ fig : summary ] . in turn",
    ", grain growth form large particles from smaller ones , increasing the population of large particles , hence @xmath234 , leading to the arrow pointing in the opposite direction . again",
    ", these two effects form a feedback loop , promoting grain growth and enrichment of solid material .",
    "all our simulations ignore external sources of turbulence , particularly the mri , by working in the dead zone of ppds .",
    "even very weak external turbulence with @xmath240 may stir up the solids and maintain them at a height that may be insufficient for si to form dense particle clumps ( see table [ tab : vertdiff ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that planetesimal formation is facilitated by mri due to the long - lived overdensity regions that effectively trap the particles .",
    "however , they chose very large particle size with @xmath241 .",
    "when smaller particles are used , they are diffused to a much larger height . although si may still be present with mri turbulence and form elongated structures @xcite , particle overdensities are small .",
    "moreover , the mutual particle collision velocity is much higher in mri turbulence @xcite , which inhibits particle growth .",
    "therefore , we expect the dead zone to be the more favored region for planetesimal formation , and planetesimal formation should be easier in ppds with a larger ( radial ) extent of the dead zone .",
    "this is shown as the arrow pointing from  dead zone \" towards  planetesimal formation \" in figure [ fig : summary ] .    at the same time , the vertical and radial extent of the dead zone in ppds strongly depend on the abundance of micron - sized and smaller grains @xcite , which is reflected in the arrow connecting @xmath233 and  dead zone \" .",
    "whether there is any connection between @xmath234 and @xmath233 is uncertain .",
    "both @xmath234 and @xmath233 should be correlated with the overall disk metallicity . moreover , with more large particles ( larger @xmath234 , collisional fragmentation may lead to more small grains ( larger @xmath233 ) . despite many uncertainties , we draw a dashed double - arrow between @xmath234 and @xmath233 as our speculated connection between the two particle populations .",
    "if such connection exist , it represents the third way for ( local ) solid abundance enrichment to promote planetesimal formation .",
    "our simulations take a local patch from a simple global disk model in which all physical quantities follow a power - law dependence on disk radii .",
    "the global structure of ppds may be more complicated . in particular",
    ", the presence of a dead zone in ppds changes the steady - state disk surface density profile , and may lead to local pressure maxima at the snow line @xcite , and the inner edge of the dead zone @xcite .",
    "these pressure bumps are able to trap particles very efficiently .",
    "moreover , solids can also be trapped in long - lived vortices @xcite , although their existence is in debate .",
    "finally , the structure of ppds may be very non - steady , and undergo periods of outburst @xcite .",
    "global models take into account large - scale variations of disk structure and can follow the disk evolution . currently , the numerical resolution required for resolving the si is prohibitively high for running 3d global simulations . nevertheless , one can perform local simulations in different disk environments , and piece them together to form a global picture , as in @xcite .",
    "our simulations focus on the dynamics in the vicinity of the disk midplane with very limited radial and vertical box sizes and no magnetic field .",
    "this is mainly constrained by the fine grid resolution required for this study . in reality ,",
    "mri turbulence in the active layers may excite vertical oscillations in the disk midplane@xcite .",
    "moreover , turbulent diffusion of ions may produce magnetic activity at the disk midplane , making it  undead \" @xcite .",
    "finally , turbulent mixing of particles may become important when the active layer is relatively thick @xcite . including these effects into numerical simulations of planetesimal formation",
    "requires enlarging our box size in all dimensions by a factor of at least 10 .",
    "moreover , 3d rather than 2d simulations are necessary to maintain sustained mri turbulence .",
    "such simulations are computationally expensive , however recently the static mesh refinement ( smr ) algorithm in the athena mhd code has been parallelized .",
    "the cost of hybrid ( particles and gas ) simulations of layered disks can be substantially reduced by using fine resolution at the disk midplane ( to capture the si ) and in the active layers ( to capture the mri ) , while using coarse resolution everywhere else . with smr ,",
