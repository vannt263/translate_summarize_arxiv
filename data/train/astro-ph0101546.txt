    "unified models of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) propose that all types of agn are fundamentally the same although the presence of a dusty molecular torus prevents the observation of the broad line region for particular line of sights . in this picture type 1 agn ( e.g. seyfert 1/qso ) are those for which the nucleus can be directly observed , while in type 2 agn ( e.g. seyfert 2 ) it is obscured by the torus ( e.g.lawrence and elvis , 1982 and antonucci , 1993 ) .",
    "strong support for this model has been given by x - ray , near - ir and mid - ir observations showing that type 2 agn are characterized by strong absorption whilst type 1 agn are relatively unabsorbed ( turner 1997 , alonso - herrero , ward , kotilainen , 1997 , maiolino 1998 and clavel 2000 ) .",
    "in this framework the infrared radiation is interpreted in terms of thermal emission from hot dust grains heated by the high energy central source emission ( optical to x - ray continuum , see e.g. granato , danese , franceschini 1997 ) .",
    "barcons ( 1995 hereafter b95 ) investigated the 12@xmath5 m to hard x - ray ( hx , 2 to 10 kev ) flux ratios of a sample of nearby agn and galaxies using _ iras _ and _",
    "heao1 a-2 _ observations .",
    "they found that type 1 agn have larger hx/12@xmath5 m flux ratios than type 2 agn whilst normal galaxies have very weak hx emission .",
    "this implies high column densities ( log(n@xmath10)@xmath1122 @xmath12 ) in the type 2 objects , supporting the basic unified model hypothesis .",
    "the study of b95 was necessarily restricted to nearby objects .",
    "the investigation of this flux ratio to deeper fluxes and higher redshifts will probe the properties of luminous sources such as qsos and broad absorption line qsos ( balqsos ) and provide clues to the constancy of agn activity in the universe .",
    "the _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ x - ray satellites have been successful in determining the hx properties of agn and have resolved @xmath030% of the hx background into discrete sources , mostly type 1 and type 2 agn ( e.g.  ueda 1998 , 1999 , cagnoni 1998 , fiore 1999 and akiyama 2000 ) .",
    "the recent launch of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ x - ray satellites have now made it possible to probe to fainter fluxes at hx energies .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations ( e.g.  mushotzky 2000 , fiore 2000a , brandt 2000 , giacconi 2000 and hornschemeier 2000 ) have uncovered a number of hx emitting , but optically apparently normal galaxies .",
    "the hx slopes of the sources are sufficiently hard that , when combined with the hx emitting agn sources , they can account for @xmath1175% of the hx background ( e.g.  mushotzky 2000 , giacconi 2000 and hornschemeier 2001 ) .",
    "comparisons to deep sub - mm surveys have shown that these hx sources are almost always unassociated with sub - mm sources ( e.g. hornschemeier 2000 ; severgnini 2000 ; fabian 2000 , barger 2000 ) , which instead appear to be star forming systems . due to the expected association between hx and mir emission a closer correlation should be found in the mid - ir band .",

    "the _ bepposax _ observations were taken with both the lecs and mecs instruments .",
    "the lecs observations are not considered here due to their lower sensitivity and much poorer psf below 2 kev .",
    "the mecs observations ( boella 1997b ) , from 1.3 to 10 kev , cover 5 of the 9 sub - fields in the s1 region of elais ( see fig .",

    "slightly better accuracies have been achieved in those fields where we have been able to identify more than one source at another wavelength and perform a positional shift of the x - ray sources to match the more accurate optical positions ( see table 1 ) .",

    "source detection was performed using ximage with the interactive routine _",
    "sosta_. when measuring the counts of a source a box of 13 pixels ( each pixel corresponds to 8 arcsecs ) was used .",
    "this was found to maximize the signal to noise .",
    "as the psf is much wider than the positional uncertainty , the effect on the flux from poor centroiding with weak sources is negligible .",
    "the net counts were automatically corrected for vignetting , sampling dead time and the point spread function . for each source",
    "the background was measured in large apertures at nearby orthogonal sky positions .",
    "the conversion from counts to fluxes was determined using a power law of @xmath19=0.7 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we experimented with a range of column densities ( 20@xmath6log(n@xmath29)@xmath623 ) but found small differences ( @xmath010% ) in the conversion factors as compared to the uncertainty in the counts of the x - ray sources and the flux uncertainties of the mir sources , which are of the order of 30% ( serjeant 2000 ) .",
    "the overall conclusions are not affected by these uncertainties .",
    "we initially found 13 sources at the snr@xmath113 poisson level in either the 1.3 to 10 kev ( t ) or 2 to 10 kev ( hx ) band although 2 of these sources could be unreliable because of possible source confusion ( sources s2 and s4 ) , and are included in a supplementary table ( see tables 2 and 3 and fig .",

    "we would expect @xmath61 spurious source due to background fluctuations . considering the relatively small cosmic volume sampled ,",
    "the snr@xmath30@xmath113 number counts of sources are reasonably consistent with those found by giommi , perri and fiore ( 2000 ) , see fig .",

    "these sources are used in all the further analysis .",
    "the softness ratios of the sources were determined following the procedure of fiore ( 2000b ) with the ratio defined as ( s - h)/(s+h ) where s = count rate in 1.3 to 4.5 kev band and h = count rate in 4.5 to 10 kev band , see fig .",

    "bepposax _ and _ asca _ surveys ( e.g.  akiyama , 2000 and la franca 2000 ) sources have been matched to optical counterparts . in these studies",
    "the high optical source density often results in @xmath111 possible optical counterpart within the large _ bepposax _ and _ asca _ error boxes .",
    "the relatively low source density of mir in this study results in less ambigious source matching although we are implictly assuming that an _ isocam _ source within a _ bepposax _ error box is associated with the hx source .",
    "this association is expected within the unified model of agn ( antonucci , 1993 ) and is found from both observational and theoretical tests of this model ( e.g.  b95 , granato , danese and franceschini , 1997 , krabbe , boker and maiolino , 2000 and alonso - herrero , 2001 ) .",
    "these x - ray and infrared observations are two orders of magnitude deeper than those of b95 ( see fig .",
    "we measured 3@xmath8 x - ray upper limits for all the spectroscopically classified mir sources , labeled in fig 1 .",
    "this was performed by measuring the counts at an mir source position in the same fashion as for the detected sources .",
    "the measured upper limits depend on the off - axis distance and range from 10@xmath1 @xmath17 on - axis to 3 - 5x10@xmath1 @xmath17 off - axis .",
    "in this discussion we comment on the hx - mir source identifications and compare the observed hx - mir properties of the _ bepposax _ and _ isocam _ objects to those of other samples previously reported in the literature ( e.g. b95 and elvis 1994 , hereafter e94 ) .",
    "as already discussed we found 7 mir sources ( including the 2.6@xmath8 _ isocam _ source ) within the 16 error - boxes ( @xmath060 arcsec , 95% significance , see section 2 ) of the _ bepposax _ detections .",
    "we have obtained optical spectroscopy for 6 of these sources ( la franca in prep . and",
    "gruppioni in prep . ) , see table 4 .",
    "as the optical spectroscopic campaign targetted those sources with 17@xmath3520.5 mags , we did not obtain a spectroscopic identification for the brightest source .",

    "the 2.6@xmath8 _ isocam _ source is associated with a galaxy at @xmath7=0.325 and has @xmath37@xmath39 erg s@xmath14 if the association is real . based on the distribution of object types found in other _",
    "bepposax _ and _ asca _ surveys ( e.g.  akiyama et al , 2000 and la franca 2000 ) we would expect to find two type 2 sources in our study .",
    "we find none which seems surprising but is not significant ( 1@xmath8 ) given the small number of sources .",
    "one of the two low redshift qsos ( @xmath401 ) is radio detected ( source 3 , @xmath7=0.559 , @xmath41 = 1.5 mjy , gruppioni 1999 ) .",
    "balqsos are rarely detected in the x - ray , particularly in the soft band , possibly due to large absorption of the x - ray emission ( gallagher 1999 ) .",
    "this is the first time a high redshift balqso has been detected in both the mir and hx .",
    "the unclassified source 8 is a bright optical source with an extended optical profile and is possibly detected at 90@xmath5 m ( @xmath42 = 81 mjy , efsthathiou 2000 ) .",
    "its soft hx ratio ( section 4.2 ) is consistent with either an agn or a thermal bremsstrahlung emitting source .",
    "its high hx / mir flux ratio ( section 4.3 ) suggests the former and it is probably a nearby seyfert galaxy .",
    "the detection of a normal galaxy seems surprising although many apparently normal galaxies have been detected in recent _ chandra _ surveys ( e.g. mushotzky 2000 , fiore 2000a , brandt 2000 , giacconi 2000 and hornschemeier 2000 ) although none have such a high x - ray luminosity and many tend to have harder x - ray spectral slopes .",
    "this object has an hx / mir flux ratio , x - ray spectral slope and luminosity similar to qsos although lacks the typical qso broad optical emission lines .",
    "other interesting possibilities are that it is a bl lac object , although the lack of radio emission and a strong calcium break suggest against this , or a dominant cd cluster galaxy with the x - ray emission coming from the cluster medium .",
    "the expected log(hx / mir ) ratio for this latter possibility is @xmath324.7@xmath430.4 ( e.g. edge and stewart , 1991 and bregman , mcnamara and oconnell , 1990 ) . due to the uncertain nature of this source",
    "these possibilities are not further pursued .",
    "we have compared the softness ratios ( see fiore 2000b ) to those expected for various hx seds , see fig .",
    ". the softness ratios of the qsos , although extremely uncertain , show a variety of soft and hard sources 0.5@xmath6(s - h)/(s+h)@xmath6 - 0.5 , similar to those found in the _ bepposax _ hellas survey ( fiore 2000b ) .      we have compared the observed hx / mir flux ratios to those expected for a variety of object types",
    "b95 statistically studied the correlation between hx and 12@xmath5 m for the _ iras _",
    "12@xmath5 m sample of agn and emission line galaxies ( rush , malkan , spinoglio , 1993 , hereafter rms ) .",
    "the 12@xmath5 m sample represents the properties of mir sources in the local universe whilst the redshifts of these _ isocam_/_bepposax _ objects are substantially higher . therefore in order to compare this study to that of b95 it is necessary to take into account the effects of redshift and the construction of spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are necessary . in the generation of seds",
    "we have decided to take an empirical approach due to the uncertain contribution of agn and galactic activity at mid - ir wavelengths ( e.g.  see the detailed modelling of cen a which is clearly an agn although its infrared emission appears to be dominated by galactic processes , alexander , 1999 ) . to do this",
    "we firstly evaluated and constructed hx and infrared seds of qsos , seyfert 2 and hii galaxies and then normalized the x - ray sed to reproduce the hx / mir flux ratios of the local value at @xmath440 as determined by e94 for qsos , and by b95 for seyfert 2 and hii galaxies .",
    "only a few seyfert 2s were detected at hx energies by b95 although the hx / mir flux ratio distribution is very similar to the _ iras _",
    "60@xmath5 m selected , hx detected 16 seyfert 2 galaxies in alexander ( 2001 ) ( log(hx / mir)=-7.0@xmath430.7 ) .",
    "the b95 hx / mir flux ratio for the hii galaxies is an upper limit .",
    "the hx seds were taken from pompilio , la franca and matt ( 2000 ) for the cases of qso and seyfert 2 ; the qso sed is a two part power law whilst the seyfert 2 sed uses this same spectrum convolved with the seyfert 2 absorbing column density distribution found by maiolino ( 1998 ) .",
    "the seyfert 2 galaxies in the maiolino study were not mir selected .",
    "however , the column density distribution is very similar to that found for far - ir selected seyfert 2 galaxies ( i.e.  log(@xmath45)@xmath022 to 25 @xmath12 , alexander , 2001 ) .",
    "the hii galaxy hx sed was determined assuming a bremsstrahlung thermal spectrum with kt=5.8 kev , as found for the starburst galaxy ngc253 ( cappi 1999 ) .",
    "the seyfert 2 and hii galaxy infrared seds were determined using the xu ( 1998 ) empirical algorithm which takes the four _ iras _ band fluxes to predict an overall 2 to 120@xmath5 m sed assuming three basic components : agn , starburst and cirrus .",
    "the @xmath612@xmath5 m emission is predicted from the _ iras _ colours and produced using agn , starburst and cirrus observational templates which include pah emission and dust absorption features .",
    "the sample used to determine these seds was the rms sample as classified by alexander and aussel ( 2000 ) .",
    "these seds do not account for starlight , which can potentially be a large contributor for @xmath46@xmath67@xmath5 m and would lead to underestimates of the hx / mir ratios .",
    "therefore we have only used these seds for z@xmath61 , which is sufficient for the non - qso sources . for the qsos",
    "we have used the empirically determined sed of e94 which includes the contribution from starlight and gives a good match to the low redshift optically selected pg qsos ( schmidt and green , 1983 ) . as this sed",
    "is derived mostly from low redshift sources , we are assuming little sed evolution for z@xmath63 ( see section 4.3.1 for discussion ) .",
    "the hx / mir flux ratios of the _ bepposax_/_iso _ sample are shown in fig .",
    "the errorbars associated with the seds take into account the statistical spread in the hx / mir ratios measured locally by b95 . in the case of seyfert 2s and",
    "qsos the effect of redshift is to increase the hx flux with respect to the mir flux .",
    "the difference with redshift is not dramatic for either object type because the assumed hx column densities are quite low , although see section 4.3.2 for the case of a compton thick source ( log(n@xmath10)@xmath1124 @xmath12 ) .",
    "the hii galaxies are difficult to detect in the hx at any redshift but particularly at high redshift where the hx k - correction is positive . in the case of a higher temperature of the x - ray emitting gas than that assumed here",
    ", the hx / mir ratio will stay constant to higher redshifts , dropping off significantly at the exponential cut - off energy ( i.e. at @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the bremsstrahlung temperature in kev ) .",
    "the flux ratio distribution of the hx / mir upper limits are shown in fig .",
    "7b . the mean hx upper limit and log(hx / mir ) are 3.3x10@xmath1 @xmath34 and @xmath325.1 respectively .",
    "to detect all the sources requires significantly deeper x - ray observations .",
    "hx observations of the northern elais fields will be carried out by _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ to limiting fluxes of @xmath03x10@xmath49 and 10@xmath50 @xmath34 respectively .",
    "assuming the mean flux and hx / mir flux ratio of this _ bepposax _ survey , the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys should reach mean flux ratios of log(hx / mir)@xmath0@xmath327.1 and log(hx / mir)@xmath0@xmath326.6 although clearly some objects with lower ratios will also be detected .",
    "survey ( two acis - i 16 arcmin pointings ) covers a small area but should detect all the agn and some hii galaxies within the field of view whilst the _ xmm - newton _ survey covers a similar area to this survey and should detect all the qsos , most of the seyfert 2 galaxies and a few hii galaxies .      the majority of the hx - mir associated sources are qsos .",
    "the observed qso hx / mir flux ratios appear consistent with that of the median e94 qso sed .",
    "the e94 uvsx sample includes 47 quasars selected to have at least 300 counts in the einstein ipc and with v@xmath617 mags to be observable by iue ; 29 members are radio quiet and 18 radio loud .",
    "the sample is consequently biased toward objects at low redshifts ( although 7 objects have @xmath511 , 4 @xmath512 , 1 @xmath513 ) , of moderate luminosity and with high x - ray to optical flux ratios .    in order to increase the statistics of our comparison we added to the mir sample qsos from andreani , franceschini and granato ( 1999 ) with @xmath52200 mjy , and created as a comparison an optically selected sample using 12@xmath5 m detections or upper limits of the pg optically selected qsos from sanders ( 1989 ) . to increase the number of objects at high redshift",
    "we have taken those objects from neugebauer ( 1986 ) with z@xmath112 .",

    "these flux ratios are consistent with each other and with the e94 sed .",
    "this suggests that mir selected qsos of r@xmath620 mags come from the same population as optically selected qsos and that there is little sed evolution for z@xmath63 .    as a further and more definitive test",
    "we have compared the log(b / mir ) ratios of all the mir detected qsos in the s1 region to those of the pg qso sample ( schmidt and green , 1983 and sanders et al , 1989 ) , see fig .",
    "the advantage of this comparison is that we can use the full qso set from both the elais and pg surveys",
    ". the mir qsos are consistent with the flux ratios of the e94 sed and the pg qsos .",
    "this further strengthens the evidence that mir selected qsos of r@xmath620 mags come from the same population as optically selected qsos .",
    "although the statistics are still poor , low redshift balqsos seem to be located in a different region of the hx / mir plane to qsos , see fig .",
    "this is consistent with that expected from an absorbed source .",
    "the low - redshift qso , that lies close to the balqsos in the hx / mir plane shown in fig .",
    "8 , is a narrow line seyfert 1 galaxy ( izw1 ) , an unusually red source ( e.g.  see e94 ) which may be different to the general qso population ( e.g. see brandt and gallagher , 2000 ) .",
    "our balqso has a hx / mir flux ratio similar to that found for normal qsos , apparently in contradiction with that found for low redshift balqsos .",
    "this difference could be due to the negative hx k - correction effect of an absorbed hx spectrum , see fig .",
    "we can test whether the observed hx / mir flux ratio is compatible with that expected for an absorbed hx source by constructing a possible balqso sed .",
    "we have chosen to use the compton thick hx spectrum of the type 2 qso object iras09104 + 4109 ( franceschini 2000 ) and the qso infrared sed of e94 , normalised to the hx / mir ratio of iras09104 + 4109 .",
    "the positive effect of redshift on the hx emission can clearly be seen ( see fig .",
    "8) showing that a high redshift hx absorbed source can have a similar hx / mir flux ratio to an unabsorbed source . therefore",

    "this suggests that high redshift balqsos should be comparatively easy to detect in the hx band , allowing the true fraction of balqsos in the high redshift qso population to be determined .",
