    "in the week light flux , that propagates through medium , polarization of electromagnetic field does not depend on the intensity of light and is defined unambiguously by the polarization of the field incident on the interface of vacuum and the matter under study .",
    "this relationship is changed radically in nonlinear optics , where the indices of refraction and absorption are the functions of the radiation intensity .",
    "this may lead us to polarization multi - stability and polarization chaos . when the intensity in the `` input '' is changed adiabatically in the `` output '' polarization",
    "is not yet the simple function and consists of stable and unstable areas [ 1 ] . at certain values of medium and radiation parameters ,",
    "when we have in the `` input '' stationary radiation , in the `` output '' polarization undergoes auto - oscillatory changes or polarization pseudo - chaotic changes in time may happen , which have continuous frequency spectrum [ 1 ] .",
    "polarization instability , due to nonlinear gyrotropy , is a matter of great interest for nonlinear optics of biological objects and exiton spectroscopy in solid states .",
    "the dependence of natural optical activity of isotropic medium on the intensity of electromagnetic wave is the simplest example of manifestation of nonlinear gyrotropy [ 2 ] .",
    "nonlinear gyrotropy manifests itself clearly in such substances that are characterized by strong non - locality of nonlinear response .",
    "the ratio of characteristic size of medium to the wavelength plays the role of the spatial dispersion representative that determines the scale of non - locality . therefore [ 3 ] , the effects of spatial dispersion of nonlinearity and polarization instability connected with them may be important first of all in the cholesterol liquid crystals near the phase point of transition into the isotropic state @xmath0 , in chiral biological macromolecules @xmath0 and in semiconductors near the absorption resonances of exiton and bi - exitons @xmath1 [ 1 ] .",
    "the idea was developed to explain the polarization instability , according to which nonlinear gyrotropic medium may be described as the unity of nonlinear oscillators presented by the kuhn s nonlinear model [ 1 ] .",
    "the author of the mentioned article could obtain the implreit material equations of gyrotropic medium , in which cubic nonlinearity of molecular oscillators is taken into account and which permits the indistinct solutions for medium response .",
    "first kuhn introduced one of the popular oscillator models for optically active medium .",
    "its detailed description may be seen in [ 4 ] . and",
    "we concentrate on some details .",
    "the kuhn s molecule is formed by two oscillators , which are connected to each other by elastic interaction and they oscillate along the mutually perpendicular directions .",
    "the oscillators are separated in space .",
    "the kuhn s molecule has right - left asymmetry i.e. it is a chiral molecule .",
    "the response of medium consisting of the kuhn s molecules is non - local agitation of one of the oscillators conducted to the second end of the molecule .",
    "the size of the molecule determines the characteristic scale of spatial dispersion . in spite of simplicity",
    "the kuhn s model is quite productive .",
    "for example , the ensemble of the kuhn s molecules oriented randomly represents the simplest model of isotropic gyrotropic medium .",
    "if we assume that the distance between the oscillators is zero , or if we rule out the bond between oscillators , the ensemble of kuhn s molecules randomly oriented represents the simplest model of isotropic non - gyrotropic medium .",
    "generalization of the kuhn s model on the problems of nonlinear polarization optics presents one of the important directions of macroscopic modeling .",
    "this kind of generalization requires taking into account the nonlinear elastic forces in molecules .",
    "let us examine the variant of nonlinear oscillator model according to the article [ 4 ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the molecule consists of kinetic energy of both charges , potential energy of elastic deformation and energy of oscillators interaction taking into account nonlinear members .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the inharmonious of individual oscillator and to the case of cubic nonlinearity bond between oscillators : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is a natural frequency of individual oscillator , @xmath4 determine there interaction , @xmath5 determines anharmonicity of oscillations .",

    "but if @xmath11 and vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 are noncollinear , the kuhn s oscillators system loses symmetry with respect to any finite transformation and acquires spiral structure ( chirality ) , i.e. it shall have different interaction with light of right and left polarization . in the simplest case the direction of the oscillations is orthogonal @xmath14 and equilibrium positions",

    "we have obtained , using van - der pole generalized method [ 5 , 6 ] , the analytical solutions . in case of strong nonlinearity , when it is impossible to use analytical methods , numerical methods are used for this purpose .",

    "the last forth paragraph of the paper is devoted to generalization of the kuhn s model for infinit clain of interacting oscillators .",
    "as we mentioned in introduction , the aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of the kuhn s nonlinear oscillations influenced by the plane polarized light wave .",

    "let us rewrite the set of equations ( 2 ) in the generalized coordinates in the following form : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 let us look for solutions of the set ( 3)in the form of solutions of linear set of equations : @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 are slowly varying in time functions , @xmath42 - the natural frequencies of linear uniform set of equations , which are solutions of the following equation : @xmath43 @xmath44 and the rest of the coefficients are determined with the help of the following equations : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 substituting these expressions in ( 5 ) yields : @xmath49 @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58    as we have noted above , @xmath41 are slowly varying functions of time . additional condition that will be imposed on these functions is the following : the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates must have the same form as in the case of the constant @xmath41 coefficients .",
