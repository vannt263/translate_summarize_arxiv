    "massive gravity has its own series of developments as a modified gravity beyond general relativity . back in 1939 ,",
    "fierz and pauli investigated a first model of massive gravity @xcite .",
    "the model was a linearized general relativity , where the fluctuation of geometry propagates a spin-2 graviton , plused linear interactions which , in a particle physics language , corresponds to giving a non - zero mass to the graviton , hence the name `` massive gravity '' .",
    "this model was supposed to be coincide with general relativity in a massless limit but it faced a theoretical crisis when discontinuities in such limit were found by van dam , veltman , and zakharov @xcite .",
    "in particular , the discontinuities were found as different predictions between fierz - pauli massive gravity and general relativity .",
    "the problem remained for several years until vainshtein proposed a way out by introducing higher - order interactions into the fierz - pauli massive gravity @xcite .",
    "in other words , he claimed that inside a particular scale , coined vainshtein radius , any predictions from the linear theory can not be trusted unless nonlinear contributions are taken into account .",
    "however , adding such nonlinearities , claimed by boulware and deser , not only fixes the discontinuity problem but also introduces a theoretical inconsistency , namely a boulware - deser ghost @xcite .",
    "this ghost is an extra degree of freedom , apart from 5 degrees of freedom originally existing in the linear massive gravity , whose kinetic term has a wrong sign .",
    "the ghost problem had been a blockage for the massive gravity theory until recently in 2010 , de rham , gabadadze , and tolley found suitable nonlinear interactions which does not excite the boulware - deser mode , dubbed drgt massive gravity @xcite .",
    "thus , massive gravity became again an active field of study .",
    "although it was just a generalization back then , massive gravity has its modern motivations .",
    "introducing a non - zero mass to a graviton shrinks the scale at which the gravity works .",
    "in other words , the graviton mass weakens the gravitation at large scale . as a result",
    ", it allows a cosmic acceleration and hence may be able to describe the mysterious dark energy in its language .",
    "this motivates cosmologists to study its cosmological implications .",
    "moreover , since de rham , gabadadze , and tolley found the healthy nonlinear massive gravity , the theory had again opened a door to various researches on massive gravity , not only its cosmology but people also study astrophysical objects in the theory like black holes @xcite . for cosmological models of massive gravity , it has been found that the solutions in the models with minkowski fiducial metric do not admit the flat and closed flrw solutions for the physical metric @xcite . in order to obtain the all kinds of flrw solutions , one may consider a general form of the fiducial metric @xcite .",
    "it has been found , however , that there are some inconsistencies when cosmology is taken into account .",
    "for example , some degrees of freedom cease to exist when the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) ansatz is assumed @xcite .",
    "this leads to numerous studies beyond the drgt massive gravity @xcite .",
    "one of those is to generalize a constant graviton mass to be varied by other scalar field , dubbed mass - varying massive gravity @xcite .",
    "the theory is proven to be free of boulware - deser ghost .",
    "however , cosmological implications of such model indicates the universe with subdominant contributions from massive gravity",
    ". in particular , the graviton mass is governed by an inverse of a scale factor of the universe which will vanish at late time .",
    "consequently , such model can not give a proper explanation to the cosmic expansion caused by the massive graviton .",
    "in this work , we propose an alternative way to construct a mass - varying massive gravity . not only by a scalar field ,",
    "but the graviton mass is also determined by the kinetic term of the scalar field .",
    "moreover , the scalar field is governed by a k - essence lagrangian @xcite . under the flrw ansatz",
    ", we found a solution whose the graviton mass do not necessarily vanish at late time .",
    "moreover , by assuming both the k - essence and the graviton mass behave as perfect fluids , we found that the graviton mass can give rise to a `` dust - like '' matter while combining with other contributions it is possible to have an equation of state parameter close to @xmath0 , as suggested by recent observation @xcite .",
    "such matter may be responsible for a dark matter , another mysterious content known to exist in addition to the ordinary matter . since the graviton mass can give rise to both of the dark contents , it is tempting to consider its evolution whether there exists an epoch in which both contents in the dark sector are comparable , the so - called cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : eom ] , the proposed model is addressed along with its equations of motion in the flrw background .",
    "we also discuss some crucial properties of the model in this section where we have shown the existence of the dust - like matter expected to be responsible for the dark matter . with",
    "helps from appropriate assumptions , we show in section [ sec : trial ] the solution to this model which corresponds to the dark energy and the non - vanishing characteristic of the graviton mass existing in this model . after getting some perspectives , we begin the dynamical system analyses in section [ sec : dyna ] to find all possible fixed points and their stabilities and the extended analyses are covered in section [ sec : exdyna ] .",
    "we conclude our work in the last section by the discussion on key ideas of our work and on whether or not the coincidence problem is alleviated .",
    "we consider a mass - varying drgt massive gravity action where the graviton mass is varied by the k - essence field .",
    "usually , one may consider a graviton mass as a function which varies as the scalar field propagates @xcite .",
    "however , in this work , we will consider the graviton mass not only as a function of the scalar field @xmath1 but also its kinetic term @xmath2 .",
    "the action of such model can be expressed as @xmath3 + v(x,\\phi ) ( \\mathcal{l}_2[g , f ] + \\alpha_3\\mathcal{l}_3[g , f ] + \\alpha_4\\mathcal{l}_4[g , f ] )   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad+ p(x,\\phi)\\bigg ] .",

    "@xmath7 s represent the interactions of the @xmath8th order of the massive graviton , and @xmath9 is a lagrangian of the k - essence field . in particular ,",
    "those interactions of the massive graviton are constructed from two kinds of metrics and can be expressed as follows , @xmath10&=\\frac{1}{2}\\left([\\mathcal{k}]^2-[\\mathcal{k}^2]\\right ) , \\label{l2 } \\\\",

    ", one can choose it to be any kind of metric which shares the same symmetries as the physical metric does .",

    "we consider the cosmological implications of the proposed model , where the isotropic and homogeneous universe is assumed whose spacetime is represented quite well by the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as follows , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a lapse function , @xmath21 represents a scale factor which determines the scale of the spatial distance , and @xmath22 is the spatial maximally symmetric metric whose the spatial curvature is characterized by @xmath23 corresponding to the open , flat , and closed geometry respectively .",

    "( [ eqn : neom ] ) is a friedmann equation with extra matter contents coming from the graviton mass . as a partner to the friedmann equation",
    ", the so - called acceleration equation corresponds to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : aeom ] ) .",
    "since we have the bianchi s identity relating the equations of motion , these 5 equations of motion are not entirely independent .",
    "note that this set of equations recovers the original self - accelerating cosmology when the square of a graviton mass @xmath36 is constant by which the usual condition @xmath37 is obtained readily from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : stuckeom ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , as @xmath36 being constant is no longer the case , the equations of motion look even more complex than those in general relativity . to simplify the following calculations , we choose @xmath38 such that the k - essence field behaves as perfect fluid .",

    "( [ eqn : neom ] ) .",
    "interestingly , this looks exactly like a continuity equation of a `` dust - like '' matter with an interaction to the other matter sector determined by the flow rate of the form @xmath52 .",

    "in case of a constant @xmath55 , this ensures one of the properties that this matter shares with the dust ; the energy density is as inversely proportional to @xmath56 as the dust is . according to such characteristics , it is reasonable to interpret @xmath51 as a dark matter . by doing so",
    ", this kind of dark matter possesses some interesting features .",
    "firstly , @xmath51 is a dust - like matter which can arise naturally from the massive gravity sector indicating that dark matter may be just an artifact of the varying graviton mass caused by the kinetic term of the k - essence field .",
    "moreover , this claim is still valid even in the case of @xmath57 .",
    "since a graviton mass can represent dark energy in a generic class of the drgt massive gravity , this suggests a unification of the dark sector , namely dark energy and dark matter , by such varying graviton mass .",
    "secondly , by having this kind of matter in the theory , we may expect this model of mass - varying massive gravity to solve the cosmic coincidence problem , where the universe is known to be composed mainly of comparable amounts of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "thanks to the unification suggested above , it may be possible to provide an explanation on the coincidence problem by the existence of the graviton mass alone while the cosmic acceleration also counts .    since the equations of motion are coupled in a very cumbersome way , to get a whole picture of this system we need to perform a dynamical analysis , which is the main subject in the very last section .",
    "however , we can still get some rough descriptions , as a guideline to the dynamical analysis , by introducing some simple assumptions to the system , which is done in the next section .",
    "it is widely known that our universe is expanding with acceleration for which dark energy is responsible .",
    "there is recently an observational evidence indicating that the observed effective equation of state parameter of the dark energy is close to @xmath0 @xcite . in this section",
    ", we shall adopt this characteristic by treating all the contributions from the graviton mass to have such property .",
    "we define @xmath58 from the above definition , the corresponding equation of state parameter is defined as @xmath59    by treating @xmath60 as an energy density of dark energy , we set @xmath61 and then we have the following condition , @xmath62 to simplify the calculation , we use the perfect - fluid form of @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ vperfect ] ) .",
    "consequently , eq . ( [ matchingeos ] ) becomes @xmath63 eq .",

    "( [ sol : exponent ] ) , @xmath66 since @xmath67 , and hence @xmath68 and @xmath69 are constant , this equation can be integrated easily , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an integration constant .",
    "now we have @xmath72 furthermore , eq . ( [ sol : x ] ) can possibly determine a relation between the scale factor and the rate of change of the scalar field since @xmath73    the expression of @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dedmass ] ) shows the evolution of the ( square of ) graviton mass as @xmath31 evolves . in the previous model of mass - varying massive gravity @xcite ,",
    "in which the minkowski fiducial metric is used , the varying graviton mass shrinks as the scale factor grows . in this model , however , the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : dedmass ] ) determines whether the graviton mass will shrink or not as the scale factor grows , or remain constant in case that the exponent vanishes .",
    "note that this crucial difference is caused by the different form of the fiducial metric , which is the flrw metric in this case compared with the minkowski one in the previous models .",
    "this result indicates the sensitivity of the fiducial metric existing in the generic drgt massive gravity where different fiducial metrics set different stages for the system and provide different solutions @xcite .",
    "one more crucial point of this analysis is that the contributions from the graviton mass can have the same equation of state parameter as dark energy while one of those contributions possesses characteristics of dust , namely the term @xmath74 . from eq .",
    "( [ darkmatter ] ) , such term belongs to the dark matter @xmath51 .",
    "this may be a way out for the cosmic coincidence problem since we may infer that varying graviton mass is responsible for a dark matter via the term like @xmath74 , as we have claimed in the previous section , while it can still drive the accelerating expansion .",
    "to verify this idea , and to seek for a finer description of this model , we will perform a dynamical analysis , which is in the next section .",
    "in this section , we will consider dynamics of the universe governed by this new class of mass - varying massive gravity using the method of the autonomous system . due to the complexity of the graviton mass",
    ", we will begin this section with a simple analysis by considering the flat flrw where @xmath75 and assuming that @xmath76 are constant over time , thus @xmath77 . from this assumption ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath55 is simply determined by eq .",

    "let us define dimensionless variables as follows , @xmath83 by using these variables , the equations of motion can be written in the form of autonomous equations as @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",

    "we will extend our analysis to a more general case with @xmath44 being the variable in the next section .",
    "the effective equation of state parameter can be written in terms of the dimensionless variables as @xmath88 from these autonomous equations , corresponding fixed points can be found by evaluating @xmath89 and @xmath90 in eq .",

    "we have constructed a new class of the mass - varying massive gravity in which not only the k - essence field but also its kinetic term determine the variation of the graviton mass .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : eom ] that there is a possibility for the graviton mass to live at late time compared with the previous model whose the graviton mass only depends on the scalar field and shrinks as the universe grows @xcite .",
    "after simple manipulations and under particular assumptions , we found that a `` dust - like '' matter which behave like a non - relativistic dust can naturally comes out from the graviton mass and it is a possible candidate for a dark matter .",
    "this can be seen more clearly in the case @xmath57 in which the dark matter comes solely from the varying graviton mass .",
    "having such matter in the system , this model of massive gravity can describe the cosmic accelerating expansion with the equation of state parameter close to @xmath0 while the universe is not entirely dominated by the dark energy part contributed also by the graviton mass .",
    "this property signals a possibility of having the universe composed of comparable amounts between dark energy and dark matter , known as the cosmic coincidence problem . to obtain a finer description on this , the usual method of the dynamical analysis",
    "is performed by taking the dark matter candidate into account and the results are carefully investigated on the issue of the coincidence problem .",
    "for the first simple case , the exponent of the kinetic term in the graviton mass @xmath44 is kept to be constant .",
    "we found the fixed points which correspond to various epochs in the history of the universe such as the matter - dominated period and massive - gravity - dominated periods .",
    "however , to have those fixed points with the appropriate stabilities in the evolution of the universe , the results suggest a system with @xmath44 as additional variable .",
    "the more general case , where @xmath44 is allowed to vary , is investigated where the radiation is included .",
    "while the result covers all the fixed points in the constant @xmath44 case , this allows the evolution in which there exist a matter - dominated period as well as a late - time expansion epoch .",
    "there are several crucial points in this investigation .",
    "firstly , we obtain the universe in which the graviton mass serves as both dark energy and dark matter while it can still drive the cosmic acceleration . secondly , to solve the coincidence problem",
    ", we obtain a universe with the effective equation of state parameter significantly below @xmath0 unless both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are set to be equal with one another for the entire evolution of the universe . since the analyses are under particular assumptions , this model still has rooms to be studied in a more complicated way .",
    "for example , one can exclude the assumptions proposed in this work for a more complex system or one can consider this model in a different aspect like its astrophysical implications . not only on the applications , but studying on the theoretical consistency , whether there exists",
    "a ghost instability or not , is also a worthy challenge which we leave it as a future work . apart from those mentioned , one may think of constraining the model with various observations .",
    "this idea is also interesting since the observations may judge the fate of this model by tightening it with constraints .",
