    "we call _ herbrand constructive _ any intermediate logic  a logic stronger than intuitionistic but weaker than classical  which enjoys a strong form of herbrand s theorem : for _ every _ provable formula @xmath1 , the logic proves as well an herbrand disjunction @xmath2\\lor \\ldots \\lor a[m_{k}/\\alpha]\\ ] ] of course intuitionistic logic is trivially herbrand constructive , but classical logic is not : @xmath3 is arbitrary ! in between , there are several interesting logics which do have the property . yet for herbrand constructive logics there are no known natural deduction formulations with associated curry - howard correspondences , except in trivial cases .",
    "we launch here a new series of papers to fill this void .",
    "we begin with dummett s first - order and second - order logic @xmath4 : intuitionistic logic extended with the so - called dummett linearity axiom @xmath5 @xmath0 was introduced by dummett @xcite as an example , in the propositional case , of a many - valued logic with a countable set of truth values .",
    "its propositional fragment is also called gdel - dummett logic , because it is based on the truth definition given in gdel s seminal paper on many - valued logics @xcite . in this case",
    ", the logic can be formalized by corsi s sequent calculus @xcite or by the more elegant hypersequent calculus devised by avron @xcite , @xcite . surprisingly , avron s hypersequent calculus does not work for first - order @xmath0 :",
    "only recently tiu @xcite provided a more involved version of it , which indeed corresponds to @xmath0 at the first - order .",
    "in all this story , natural deduction is the great absent .",
    "since it is one of the most celebrated logical deduction systems , the question is : how is that possible ?",
    "the first issue is that @xmath0 is evidently a non - constructive system : for example , it proves the excluded middle for all negated formulas : @xmath6 ; and dummett s axiom poses even more problems . as it is well known , natural deduction was put aside by its own inventor , gentzen , precisely for the reason that he was not able to prove a meaningful normalization theorem for classical natural deduction , whilst he _ was _ for the intuitionistic case @xcite .",
    "it indeed took a surprisingly long time to discover suitable reduction rules for classical natural deduction systems with all connectives @xcite , @xcite .",
    "even this accomplishment , however , is still not enough : although dummett s axiom is classically provable , the known classical natural deduction systems fail to provide a refined computational interpretation of @xmath0 .",
    "the trouble is that @xmath0 proofs are not closed under classical reductions , because during the normalization process instances of dummett s axiom are replaced by reductio ad absurdum in @xmath7-calculus @xcite and in @xcite , and by excluded middle in @xcite .",
    "the second issue is that existential quantifiers are witnessed by multiple terms and so a parallel computational mechanism is desirable .",
    "no curry - howard correspondence offered a suitable one until very recently @xcite .",
    "sequent calculus solves these issues by means of _ structural rules_. classical logic is rendered by allowing more formulas on the righthand side of a sequent ; dummett s @xmath0 is rendered by allowing sequences of sequents and a communication mechanism between them .",
    "on the contrary , natural deduction usually solves the same issues by means of new _",
    "reduction rules_. when one wants to add some new axiom to intuitionistic natural deduction , it is enough to add it straight away or as a rule , and all the ingenuity of the construction lies in the proof transformations associated to the axiom .    inspired by hypersequents , baaz , ciabattoni and fermller",
    "@xcite did not follow the latter path and changed instead the very structure of natural deduction into an hyper version .",
    "the resulting logical calculus is an _",
    "hyper natural deduction",
    "_ corresponding to gdel - dummett first - order logic ( which is not to be confused with first - order @xmath0 and can be axiomatized by adding to @xmath0 the axiom scheme @xmath8 , where @xmath9 does not occur in @xmath10 ) .",
    "the normal form theorem , however , is only obtained by translation into the hypersequent calculus , followed by cut - elimination and backward translation : no reduction rules for hyper deductions were provided .",
    "this last task was carried out by beckmann and preining @xcite , who formulated a _",
    "propositional _ hyper natural deduction with a proof normalization procedure .",
    "unfortunately , the structural rules are so complicated that the adjective `` natural '' does not fit any more .",
    "another attempt along the `` hyper line '' has been made by hirai @xcite , with the addition of an associated lambda calculus .",
    "one can not speak of a curry - howard correspondence , however , because subject reduction does not hold : there is no match between computational steps and proof reductions .",
    "although hyper natural deduction is a legitimate proof system in its own right , the `` hyper approach '' is not the one we follow . for two reasons .",
    "the first reason is that we will show that natural deduction works perfectly as it is .",
    "there is no need to change its structure and , to render dummett s axiom , it sufficient to add the inference rule    which allows to conclude unconditionally @xmath11 from two different deductions of @xmath11 : one from the hypothesis @xmath12 and one from the hypothesis @xmath13 .",
    "we shall define simple reduction rules for proofs ending with this inference and we shall show that they are all we need to extract witnesses for existentially quantified formulas .",
    "the second reason is that natural deduction should stay _",
    "natural_. this is the very motivation that led to its discovery . indeed , gentzen starts his celebrated work @xcite on natural deduction and sequent calculus complaining that the proof systems known at the time were far removed from the actual mathematical reasoning .",
    "and his main goal was to set up a formalism with the aim of `` _ _ reproducing as precisely as possible the real logical reasoning in mathematical proofs _ _ '' . to avoid betraying natural deduction s philosophical motivations",
    ", there is no alternative but to add an inference rule that naturally mirrors the kind of reasoning corresponding to dummett s axiom , which is our approach .",
    "one of the most attractive features of intuitionistic natural deduction is that , in a very precise sense , it does not need a truth - based semantics .",
    "logical inferences are divided into two groups : introduction rules and elimination rules . and as gentzen @xcite himself famously suggested , introduction rules _ define _ , so to speak , the meaning of the logical constants they introduce ; elimination rules , on the other hand , are nothing but _ consequences _ of these definitions . in other words ,",
    "introduction rules are self - justifyng , because they fix themselves the meaning of their conclusions , whereas elimination rules are sound in virtue of the meaning fixed by the introductions .",
    "for example , the rule    says that the grounds for asserting @xmath12 consist in a proof of @xmath10 from the hypothesis @xmath3 ; therefore , the elimination @xmath14 is automatically justified : if we have a proof of @xmath3 we can plug it into the proof of @xmath10 from @xmath3 , whose existence is warranted by the meaning of @xmath12 , and obtain a proof of @xmath10 .",
    "the reverse approach works as well : we may consider elimination rules as meaning constitutive and treat introduction rules as consequences of the meaning fixed by eliminations .",
    "in other words , meaning is determined by _ how we use _ a statement , by what we can directly _ obtain _ from the statement ; we shall adopt this _",
    "standpoint , elaborated by dummett himself @xcite .",
    "this idea of internal justification , as it is , can not be generalized straight away for extensions of intuitionistic logic : new inferences tend to break the harmony between introductions and eliminations .",
    "it is at this point that brouwer s view of logic comes into play .",
    "according to brouwer @xcite , the string of `` logical '' steps appearing in a mathematical proof is in reality a sequence of mathematical constructions . what we perceive as inference rules are instead transformations of constructions for the premises into constructions for the conclusion .",
    "this insight finds a precise formalization by means of the curry - howard isomorphism : a proof is indeed isomorphic to an effective construction , in fact , _ it is _ , in and of itself , a construction .",
    "since proofs are constructions , the role of semantics is just _ explaining what these constructions do_. hence , a proof - theoretic semantics of an intermediate logic is in principle always possible and is made of two ingredients : a formalization of _ proofs as programs _ and a semantical description of what these programs achieve with their calculations .",
    "the first is obtained through the decoration of deduction trees with lambda terms , the second is the task of _ realizability_.    realizability was introduced by kleene @xcite to computationally interpret intuitionistic first - order arithmetic , but it is kreisel s @xcite later version with typed terms which embodies the modern perspective on the subject . though it was initially conceived just for intuitionistic theories , realizability can be extended to intuitionistic arithmetic with markov s principle @xcite , to intuitionistic arithmetic with the simplest excluded middle @xmath15 @xcite and even all the way up to the strongest classical theories @xcite .",
    "realizability replaces the notion of truth with the notion of _ constructive evidence_. a formula holds if it is _ realized _ by some typed program , providing some constructive information about the formula .    in the following ,",
    "we shall build a realizability interpretation for dummett s @xmath0 , inspired by krivine s realizability @xcite . by construction",
    ", every realizer always terminates its computations and , in particular , whenever it realizes an existentially quantified formula @xmath16 , it reduces to a term of the shape @xmath17 with the property that @xmath18\\lor \\dots \\lor a[m_{k}/\\alpha]\\ ] ] the circle is closed by a soundness theorem , the adequacy theorem : every formula provable in @xmath0 is realized by a closed program , which immediately implies the normalization theorem  every proof reduces to a normal form  and that @xmath0 is herbrand constructive .",
    "therefore , to extract an herbrand disjunction it suffices to reduce any proof of any existentially quantified formula to a normal form , according to a very simple set of reduction rules .      to find simple and terminating reduction rules for a natural deduction system is always tricky , but",
    "once the job is done , the reductions often look so natural that they appear inevitable .",
    "it is the effort of removing obstacles toward a good normal form what inevitably leads to these reductions , as the flow of a river leads to the sea . in the case of @xmath0 ,",
    "the main obstacles toward witness extraction for a formula @xmath1 are configurations in which one of the hypotheses introduced by the dummett inference blocks the reduction .",
    "for example , let us consider this proof shape :    where @xmath19 has been obtained from @xmath10 by a series of elimination rules .",
    "it is clear that no witness can be retrieved in the left branch of the proof above , because there is just a proof of @xmath3 and , magically , a `` void '' proof of @xmath10 obtained by modus ponens from @xmath3 and the arbitrary hypothesis @xmath12 .",
    "but ca nt we just send the proof of @xmath3 to the right branch of the dummett rule and obtain a direct proof of @xmath19 , like this ?    no ! in fact , the proof of @xmath3 too might depend on the hypothesis @xmath12 , so that the original proof could be    and thus the previous transformation is unsound .",
    "but the idea of sending the proof of @xmath3 to the right branch can work if the right branch is in turn moved on the left like this    the reductions that we shall give generalize this transformation in order to work in every situation .",
    "it is more convenient to express proof reductions in terms of program reductions , because for that purpose the lambda notation is superior to the proof tree notation . for this reason",
    ", we shall define a lambda calculus isomorphic to natural deduction for @xmath0 and then define an _ head reduction strategy _ for lambda terms , inspired by krivine s strategy @xcite .",
    "the termination of head reduction will just be a consequence of soundness of @xmath0 with respect to realizability , while the perfect match between program reductions and proof reductions will as usual be consequence of the subject reduction theorem .",
    "the decoration of intuitionistic inferences with programs is standard and dummett s rule will be decorated in the following way    the parallel operator @xmath20 is inspired by the exception operator studied in @xcite and keeps using the variable @xmath21 for communication purposes .",
    "the variable @xmath21 has the task of sending terms from @xmath22 to @xmath23 and viceversa , as well as allowing @xmath22 to call the process @xmath23 whenever it needs it and viceversa .      in section ",

    ", we make a detour into a logically inconsistent , yet computationally sound world : the system @xmath155 , a type system which extends @xmath0 . the idea that extending a system can make easier rather than harder to prove its normalization might not seem very intuitive , but it is well tested and very successful ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath155 will be our calculus of realizers .",
    "it is indeed typical of realizability , the method we shall use , to set up a calculus with more realizers than the actual proof terms @xcite .",

    "these extra tests make proof terms stronger realizers than they otherwise would be .",
    "we may imagine a realizer as a tennis player that trains himself to return fast balls thrown by a robot : if he withstands the attacks of the robot , he will perform all the more well against real weaker humans .",
    "the system @xmath155 is not meant to be a logical system : it would be inconsistent ! the purpose of the system is not logical , but computational : to simulate the reduction rules for @xmath24 by an abort operator @xmath156 .",
    "we define the typing rules of @xmath155 to be those of @xmath0 plus a new term formation scheme : +    abort axiom : :    0.15 in with @xmath156 , @xmath157 , we shall denote some generic constant @xmath158 .",
