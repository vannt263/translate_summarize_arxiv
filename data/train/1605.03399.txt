    "spin relaxation processes in semiconductors continue to attract attention in connection with a large number of spintronic applications @xcite , in which silicon appears to be a very suitable material due to long decoherence times @xcite and high gate fidelity @xcite .",
    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) is a promising technique to manipulate spins directly in high - mobility quantum well heterostructures ( qw ) @xcite . in these systems ,",
    "the main source of decoherence is typically spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) due to bulk ( bia ) , structure ( sia ) or interface inversion asymmetry ( iia ) @xcite .",
    "the interplay of the different soc contributions may result in strong anisotropy of spin relaxation and decoherence , giving a hint on their relative strength . in this work",
    "we describe decoherence and relaxation processes in general 2-deg esr experiments , quantifying the anisotropies in terms of the relative direction of external fields and main crystallographic directions .",
    "the appropriate choice of coordinate system is crucial in the calculations of spin - related observables , owing to the anisotropy that follows the interplay of the different contributions of soc . scattering relaxation events and soc",
    "are defined within the 2-deg perpendicular to the growth direction @xmath0 , determining the crystallographic coordinate system @xmath1 ( black arrows of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , whereas the quantization axis is naturally determined by the direction of the magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the magnetic coordinate system @xmath3 ( blue arrows of fig . [ fig1 ] ) , is related to the crystallographic one by the euler - rodrigues formula , consisting of a rotation along @xmath4 by the polar angle @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .    during an esr experiment ,",
    "the magnetic field direction is changed relative to the crystallographic axis , such that @xmath5 varies while the azimuth @xmath6 remains constant . for @xmath7 , spin - rotation symmetry su(2 )",
    "is completely broken ( reduced to u(1 ) ) , if both bia and sia ( only bia or only sia ) soc are present @xcite .",
    "as @xmath5 is varied , spin - rotation symmetry is completely broken , and a measurement of the anisotropy in spin observables is then expected to be captured in terms of the azimuthal angle . as a result",
    ", the relative strength of the different soc contributions can be experimentally determined in angle - resolved measurements .",
    "the aim of this work is to achieve a complete description of dyakonov - perel decoherence and relaxation processes as a function of the main angles , capturing the effects of the anisotropy that results from the interplay of bia and sia .",
    "we find that the choice of the magnetic coordinate system possesses clear advantages , rendering redfield - type equations of motion with analytical solutions .",
    "we also include the effects of the commonly neglected cubic - in - momentum terms , which may become important in typical experiments .",
    "our theoretical model finds an excellent agreement with experimental data on high - mobility qws , where the existence of strong anisotropies have long remained unexplained .",
    "this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : methods ] , we describe spin relaxation and decoherence processes . first , ( [ sec : methodsa ] ) we define the soc in the magnetic coordinate system , then we write the equations of motion within the redfield approach ( [ sec : methodsb ] ) , and finally , we obtain an expression for @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( [ sec : methodsc ] ) , first for a perpendicular magnetic field with linear soc terms , then for magnetic fields with arbitrary direction and last , including the effects of cubic in momentum soc terms",
    ". section [ sec : results ] is devoted to results , from a theoretical perspective ( [ sec : resultsa ] ) and in connection with experiments ( [ sec : resultsb ] ) .",
    "we finally give some concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a general 2-deg sample with an external magnetic field @xmath10 whose direction is defined by the polar angle @xmath5 and the azimuth @xmath6 .",
    "the latter corresponds to angle of the main crystallographic direction @xmath11 and the projection of the magnetic field onto the 2-deg ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the direction of the magnetic field @xmath12 determines the magnetic coordinate system , @xmath13 and the quantization of the spin , @xmath14 , @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the bohr magneton and @xmath17 denotes the @xmath17-factor , giving a larmor frequency of precession @xmath18 .",
    "rashba- ( sia ) and dresselhaus- ( bia ) type coupling terms appear in the hamiltonian , owing to the motion of electrons confined to the 2deg with broken inversion symmetry .",
    "note that bia terms are not limited to systems without bulk inversion ( as gaas , for instance ) but also in two - dimensional centrosymmetric - based materials such as si / sige , owing to interface - inversion asymmetry @xcite .",
    "moreover , the strength of the bia- related coupling parameter has been determined for the latter , yielding a larger value than the sia coupling @xcite .",
    "to describe soc , it is customary to choose the hilbert space spanned by the pauli matrices @xmath19 along the crystallographic directions , @xmath20 , in which the soc contributions to lowest order in momentum reads : @xmath21here @xmath22 , @xmath23 determine the strength of the rashba and dresselhaus coupling to lowest order in @xmath24 .",
    "symbol @xmath25 over @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) denotes that @xmath26 is expressed in the crystallographic coordinate system .",
    "higher order in momentum terms may be added @xcite , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the cubic rashba and dresselhaus coupling to third order in momentum .",
    "bearing in mind that @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the well width , we note that the cubic terms may become important with respect to the linear dresselhaus one as @xmath32 increases .",
    "the cubic terms are also enhanced as the carrier density increases , bearing a larger in - plane @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "scattering relaxation occurs as the @xmath34 vector changes randomly direction while the modulus remain constant , @xmath35 , with @xmath36 being the fermi wavevector .",
    "classically and neglecting scattering events , the circular motion of the electron is given by the cyclotron frequency , @xmath37 , setting @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , elastic scattering events change randomly the momentum direction in a mean interval @xmath39 . due to this cyclotron motion and random scattering ,",
    "the electron ` feels ' an average soc fluctuating field which typically is smaller than its instantaneous local value , commonly termed as ` motional narrowing ' @xcite within the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) limit @xcite .",
    "hence , it appears convenient to express the soc in terms ( [ eq_h ] ) of an effective fluctuating magnetic field in the _ magnetic _ coordinate system by a transformation defined in appendix [ app ] , namely , an euler - rodrigues rotation of all the ( pseudo- ) vectors in eq .",
    "( [ eq_h ] ) , @xmath40 ; @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the rotation matrix of an angle @xmath5 along @xmath43 , as depicted in fig.[fig1 ] . in this rotated frame the time dependency factorizes , @xmath44    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ figres2 ] shows extracted data from refs .",
    "@xcite ( black ) and @xcite ( red ) , respectively .",
    "the solid lines are theoretical fits using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttwonorm2 ] ) , whereas the broken ones are fits including only linear soc terms , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttwonorm ] ) . for the former case ,",
    "a small cubic term @xmath45 allows us to reproduce the experimental data of graeff _ et al .",
    "_ , with @xmath46 .",
    "the black lines , however , fit the data of wilamowski _ et al . _ with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , coinciding with the parameters used by tyryshkin _",
    "@xcite ( not shown )",
    ". this would imply @xmath49 and @xmath50 , that is , a system dominated by linear rashba and with a sizable cubic contribution .",
    "one data point from jantsch _ et al .",
    "_ would be consistent with @xmath51 and a large cubic term , @xmath52 .",
    "we stress that we do not attempt to extract the relative coupling strengths , @xmath53 , as different combinations of the three parameters could be consistent with the data .",
    "a more reliable determination of the parameters would require @xmath6-resolved measurements .",
    "however , absence of cubic terms in the soc would render impossible a fit to the data analyzed so far , for dp - relaxation .",
    "now we focus on the six samples presented by truitt _",
    "the experimental data are the dots of fig .",
    "[ figres ] , which we next attempt to fit using eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttwonorm2 ] ) ( solid lines ) .",
    "once again , a fit that includes only one linear term for the soc , @xmath54 ( i. e. , only one source of linear soc ) , failed to reproduce most of the experimental results ( red curves ) , as it was attempted by truitt _",
    "et al._. only the narrower sample ( ibm-01 ) agreed to this dp , linear - in momentum fit .",
    "this is consistent with the established picture where soc strengths are sample dependent and very sensitive to well widths @xcite .",
    "the blue lines correspond to the up - bound limit of anisotropy by including both rashba and dresselhaus soc , which is still far from reasonable .",
    "including both linear terms and cubic ( black curves ) contributions of soc allows to reproduce most of the experimental data .",
    "however , we need make a distinction between the left and right panels of fig . [ figres ] : the former present larger mobility and a cubic fit seem to agree very well with the data , as those in fig .",
    "[ figres2 ] , whereas the latter ones have a lower mobility and fail to reproduce dp relaxation , especially for sample ` uw-31203 ' .",
    "in the low mobility limit , tilted fields enhance surface roughness scattering , resulting from the squeezing of the 2d well in the growth direction @xcite .",
    "scattering processes would then lead to anisotropic elliot - yafet ( ey ) mechanism for relaxation @xcite , which is proportional to the scattering time , @xmath55 . here",
    "the ey coefficient @xmath56 depends on the amount of admixture of different spin states and reflects the probability that a spin - flip process occurs in a momentum scattering event .",
    "this effect has been already experimentally observed in the lower mobility samples @xcite . a linear dependence of dephasing on a parallel magnetic field",
    "has indeed been attributed to an inhomogeneous dephasing in the ey limit @xcite due to a variation @xmath57 of the @xmath17-factor , @xmath58 .",
    "we identify this source with our discrepancy with the theoretical fit on ` uw-21203 ' .",
    "the inset of the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] represents the discrepancy of the dp fit with the experimental data , showing a linear dependency for low tilted angles , which is well fitted with @xmath59 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the experimental value @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that ` uw-31203 ' data presents a pronounced ` cusp - like ' behavior ( see upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ figres ] ) , enforcing our arguments .",
    "the same argumentation may be applied to samples uw-31124 and uw-31121 , where a cusp appears evident .",
    "again , @xmath6-resolved measurements would yield the answer .",
    "_ note added _ : during the final stage of this manuscript preparation , song _ et al . _ reported on ey - mechanism in si qws .",
    "this mechanism is enhanced in lower mobility samples @xcite .",
    "their research enforces the last argument presented for the lower mobility samples of fig .",
    "[ figres ] .",
    "in summary , we derived an expression for the angular dependency of the decoherence time in a quantum well , where the choice of the appropriate coordinate system is crucial .",
    "we find that the interplay of the rashba and dresselhaus soc is reflected in the anisotropy of @xmath9 , suggesting a practical scheme to determine their relative strength in the linear - in - momentum limit .",
    "although frequently ignored , we predict strongly enhanced dp processes due to the cubic terms of the soc .",
    "experimental data owing to high mobility samples agree very well with our theoretical assumptions .",
    "additional elliot - yafet mechanisms may explain further discrepancies in samples with lower mobility .",
