    "within less than a decade , ultracold quantum gases have successfully pervaded many fields of physics .",
    "indeed , they provide a rather unique testing bed where theorists dreams can be turned into carefully designed experimental situations .",
    "this is particularly true in the condensed matter realm where they became a key player in many - body physics  @xcite .",
    "quantum hall effects did not escape the trend .",
    "the catch however is that atoms are neutral and one thus needs to implement an artificial gauge field acting on the atoms that would give rise to a strong enough effective magnetic field .",
    "a first idea was to set quantum gases into rapid rotation  @xcite .",
    "since then , more versatile and promising schemes have been introduced , some even realized , all based on light - atom interactions  @xcite .",
    "these light - induced artificial gauge fields , encompassing abelian and non - abelian situations , have opened the door to a whole class of model hamiltonians  @xcite and are addressing diverse physical situations ranging from artificial dirac monopoles  @xcite , spin - orbit ( so ) coupling  @xcite and topological phases  @xcite , to non - abelian particles  @xcite , and mixed dimensional systems  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a new proposal to generate artificial non - abelian @xmath0 gauge fields .",
    "our scheme , based on a single particle approach , is a straightforward generalization of the tripod scheme discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it is based on three space - dependent dark states arising from the coupling with resonant one - photon transitions between zeeman sub - levels belonging to different hyperfine states of an alkali atom , such as @xmath1rb , subjected to a magnetic field . in the following ,",
    "we first introduce the laser scheme we propose and work out the general expressions for both the effective vector and scalar fields .",
    "we next discuss two specific laser configurations : the first one gives rise to a non - abelian @xmath0 monopole while the second one gives rise to a non - abelian so - like coupling .",
    "finally , we discuss alkaline - earth atoms , taking the fermionic isotope of strontium as a paradigmatic example . in this case however , because the zeeman shifts of the lowest hyperfine states @xmath2 are negligible , a slightly different laser configuration is required to appropriately couple the electronic levels .    in both situations , monopole or spin - orbit coupling , working with a gauge group larger than @xmath3 , brings potentially more interesting physics for two main reasons .",
    "first , the number of species being larger , new and nontrivial many - body phenomena can emerge .",
    "for example , it has been found that a 3-color fermionic system with attractive interactions gives rise to a nontrivial trionic ground state separating the usual bec and bcs phases  @xcite .",
    "second , the gauge group being larger , it contains more subgroups and these subgroups can still have a nontrivial structure .",
    "therefore , in the presence of interactions , a larger gauge group allows for different symmetry - breaking scenarios for the ground state .",
    "for instance , in the situation of a higgs field coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field , i.e. extending the t  hooft monopole to a larger group , it has been found that the @xmath0-monopole solutions can have two different kinds of topology , depending on the subgroup leaving the ground state invariant  @xcite .",
    "similarly , it has been shown , that , on a square lattice , a system with a @xmath0 spin - orbit coupling , even in the non - interacting regime , has topologically nontrivial states , in contrast to the @xmath3 case  @xcite .",

    "because of these constraints , one can not solely rely on the laser polarization degrees of freedom and dipole selection rules to independently and selectively address the different transitions of the 2-tripod scheme .",
    "one also needs to apply a strong magnetic field to lift the zeeman degeneracy in the ground state and excited state manifolds to get well separated transitions and avoid spurious spontaneous emission processes from unwanted transitions .    for the @xmath4 line of @xmath1rb that we used as an example ,",

    "therefore , the rate of any residual spontaneous emission from the off - resonant transitions should be smaller than @xmath117 , which , in the case of @xmath1rb , might be difficult to achieve . along the same line of thought , it becomes even more challenging to address the effect of the gauge potential on the atoms dynamics over time scales in the millisecond range and beyond  @xcite .    from this point of view",

    ", the left and right tripod configurations can be driven independently ( see fig .  [ dtripod_strontium ] ) and should be well protected from spurious spontaneous emission due to unwanted off - resonant transitions .",
