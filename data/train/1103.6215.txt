    "ising model @xcite which was originally introduced as a model describing the phase transition properties of ferromagnetic materials has been widely examined in statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics . in the course of time",
    ", basic conclusions of this simple model has been improved by introducing new concepts such as disorder effects on the critical behavior of the systems in question .",
    "ising model in a quenched random field ( rfim ) which has been studied over three decades is an example of this situation .",
    "the model which is actually based on the local fields acting on the lattice sites which are taken to be random according to a given probability distribution was introduced for the first time by larkin @xcite for superconductors and later generalized by imry and ma @xcite .",
    "lower critical dimension @xmath0 of rfim has been remained as an unsolved mystery for many years and various theoretical methods have been introduced .",
    "for example , domain wall argument of imry and ma @xcite suggests that a transition should exist in three and higher dimensions for finite temperature and randomness which means that @xmath1 @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "dimensional reduction arguments @xcite conclude that the system should not have a phase transition at finite temperature in three dimensions or fewer , so @xmath2 @xcite . on the other hand , frontera and vives @xcite showed that a two dimensional ferromagnetic rfim with gaussian random field distribution exhibits order at zero temperature .    at the same time , a great many of theoretical and experimental works have paid attention on the rfim and quite noteworthy results have been obtained .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that diluted antiferromagnets such as @xmath3@xcite , @xmath4@xcite and @xmath5@xcite in a uniform magnetic field just correspond to a ferromagnet in a random uniaxial magnetic field @xcite .",
    "following studies have been devoted to investigate the phase diagrams of these systems in depth and in the mean field level it was found that different random field distributions lead to different phase diagrams for infinite dimensional models .",
    "for example , using a gaussian probability distribution schneider and pytte@xcite have shown that phase diagrams of the model exhibit only second order phase transition properties .",
    "on the other hand , aharony @xcite and matthis @xcite have introduced bimodal and trimodal distributions , respectively and they have reported the observation of tricritical behavior . in a recent series of papers , phase transition properties of infinite dimensional rfim with symmetric double @xcite and triple @xcite gaussian random fields have also been studied by means of a replica method and a rich variety of phase diagrams have been presented .",
    "the situation has also been handled on three dimensional lattices with nearest neighbor interactions by a variety of theoretical works such as effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite , monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , pair approximation ( pa ) @xcite and series expansion ( se ) method @xcite . by using eft , borges and silva @xcite studied the system for square @xmath6 and simple cubic @xmath7 lattices and they observed a tricritical point only for @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , sarmento and kaneyoshi @xcite investigated the phase diagrams of rfim by means of eft with correlations for a bimodal field distribution and they concluded that reentrant behavior of second order is possible for the system with @xmath8 .",
    "recently , fytas et al .",
    "@xcite applied monte carlo simulations on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "they found that the transition remains continuous for a bimodal field distribution , while hadjiagapiou @xcite observed reentrant behavior and confirmed the existence of tricritical point for an asymmetric bimodal probability distribution within the mean - field approximation based on landau expansion .",
    "conventional eft approximations include spin - spin correlations resulting from the usage of the van der waerden identities and provide results that are superior to those obtained within the traditional mft",
    ". however , these conventional eft approximations are not sufficient enough to improve the results , due to the usage of a decoupling approximation ( da ) that neglects the correlations between different spins that emerge when expanding the identities .",
    "therefore , taking these correlations into consideration will improve the results of conventional eft approximations . in order to overcome this point , recently we proposed an approximation that takes into account the correlations between different spins in the cluster of considered lattice @xcite .",
    "namely , an advantage of the approximation method proposed by these studies is that no decoupling procedure is used for the higher order correlation functions . on the other hand ,",
    "as far as we know , eft studies in the literature dealing with rfim are based only on discrete probability distributions ( bimodal or trimodal ) . hence , in this work we intent to study the phase diagrams of the rfim with single gaussian , bimodal and double gaussian random field distributions on isometric lattices .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows : in section [ formulation ] we briefly present the formulations .",
    "the results and discussions are presented in section [ results ] , and finally section [ conclude ] contains our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we give the formulation of present study for simple cubic lattice with @xmath9 . a detailed explanation of the method for body centered and face centered cubic lattices",
    "can be found in appendix . as a simple cubic lattice ,",
    "we consider a three - dimensional lattice which has @xmath10 identical spins arranged .",
    "we define a cluster on the lattice which consists of a central spin labeled @xmath11 , and @xmath12 perimeter spins being the nearest neighbors of the central spin .",
    "the cluster consists of @xmath13 spins being independent from the spin operator @xmath14 .",
    "the nearest neighbor spins are in an effective field produced by the outer spins , which can be determined by the condition that the thermal average of the central spin is equal to that of its nearest neighbor spins .",
    "the hamiltonian describing our model is @xmath15 where the first term is a summation over the nearest neighbor spins with @xmath16 and the second term represents the zeeman interactions on the lattice .",
    "random magnetic fields are distributed according to a given probability distribution function .",
    "present study deals with three kinds of field distribution .",
    "namely , a normal distribution which is defined as @xmath17,\\ ] ] with a width @xmath18 and zero mean , a bimodal discrete distribution @xmath19,\\ ] ] where half of the lattice sites subject to a magnetic field @xmath20 and the remaining lattice sites have a field @xmath21 , and a double peaked gaussian distribution @xmath22 + \\exp\\left[-\\frac{(h_{i}+h_{0})^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right]\\right\\}.\\ ] ] in a double peaked distribution defined in equation ( [ eq2c ] ) , random fields @xmath23 are distributed with equal probability and the form of the distribution depends on the @xmath20 and @xmath18 parameters , where @xmath18 is the width of the distribution .    according to callen identity @xcite for the spin-1/2 ising ferromagnetic system ,",
    "the thermal average of the spin variables at the site @xmath24 is given by @xmath25\\right\\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 expresses the nearest neighbor sites of the central spin and @xmath27 can be any function of the ising variables as long as it is not a function of the site . from equation ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath28 , the thermal and random - configurational averages of a central spin can be represented on a simple cubic lattice by introducing the differential operator technique @xcite @xmath29\\right\\rangle\\right\\rangle_{r } f(x)|_{x=0},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a differential operator , @xmath12 is the coordination number of the lattice and the inner @xmath31 and the outer @xmath32 brackets represent the thermal and configurational averages , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath33 in equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is defined by @xmath34,\\ ] ] and it has been calculated by numerical integration and by using the distribution functions defined in equations ( [ eq2b ] ) , ( [ eq2a ] ) and ( [ eq2c ] ) . by expanding the right hand side of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) we get the longitudinal spin correlation as @xmath35 the coefficients in equation ( [ eq6 ] ) are defined as follows @xmath36 next , the average value of the perimeter spin in the system can be written as follows and it is found as @xmath37 for the sake of simplicity , the superscript @xmath38 is omitted from the left and right hand sides of equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) are defined as @xmath39 in equation ( [ eq9 ] ) , @xmath40 is the effective field produced by the @xmath41 spins outside of the system and @xmath42 is an unknown parameter to be determined self - consistently . equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) are the fundamental correlation functions of the system . when the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is expanded , the multispin correlation functions appear . the simplest approximation , and one of the most frequently adopted is to decouple these correlations according to @xmath43 for @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the main difference of the method used in this study from the other approximations in the literature emerges in comparison with any decoupling approximation ( da ) when expanding the right - hand side of equation ( [ eq4 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "one advantage of the approximation method used in this study is that such a kind of decoupling procedure is not used for the higher order correlation functions . for spin-1/2 ising system in a random field ,",
    "taking equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) as a basis we derive a set of linear equations of the spin correlation functions in the system . at this point",
    ", we assume that @xmath45 the correlations depend only on the distance between the spins and @xmath46 the average values of a central spin and its nearest - neighbor spin ( it is labeled as the perimeter spin ) are equal to each other with the fact that , in the matrix representations of spin operator @xmath14 , the spin-1/2 system has the property @xmath47 .",
    "thus , the number of linear equations obtained for a simple cubic lattice @xmath7 reduces to twelve and the complete set is as follows @xmath48 if equation ( [ eq11 ] ) is written in the form of a @xmath49 matrix and solved in terms of the variables @xmath50 $ ] of the linear equations , all of the spin correlation functions can be easily determined as functions of the temperature and hamiltonian / random field parameters . since the thermal and configurational average of the central spin is equal to that of its nearest - neighbor spins within the present method , the unknown parameter @xmath42 can be numerically determined by the relation @xmath51 by solving equation ( [ eq12 ] ) numerically at a given fixed set of hamiltonian / random field parameters we obtain the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "then we use the numerical values of @xmath42 to obtain the spin correlation functions which can be found from equation ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 is always the root of equation ( [ eq12 ] ) corresponding to the disordered state of the system .",
    "the nonzero root of @xmath42 in equation ( [ eq12 ] ) corresponds to the long range ordered state of the system .",
    "once the spin correlation functions have been evaluated then we can give the numerical results for the thermal and magnetic properties of the system .",
    "since the effective field @xmath53 is very small in the vicinity of @xmath54 , we can obtain the critical temperature for the fixed set of hamiltonian / random field parameters by solving equation ( [ eq12 ] ) in the limit of @xmath55 then we can construct the whole phase diagrams of the system . depending on the hamiltonian / random field parameters",
    ", there may be two solutions ( i.e. two critical temperature values satisfy the equation ( [ eq12 ] ) ) corresponding to the first / second and second order phase transition points , respectively .",
    "we determine the type of the transition by looking at the temperature dependence of magnetization for selected values of system parameters .",
    "in this section , we discuss how the type of random field distribution effects the phase diagrams of the system . also , in order to clarify the type of the transitions in the system , we give the temperature dependence of the order parameter .",
    "the form of single gaussian distribution which is defined in equation ( [ eq2b ] ) is governed by only one parameter @xmath18 which is the width of the distribution . in fig . 1",
    ", we show the phase diagram of the system for simple cubic , body centered cubic and face centered cubic lattices in @xmath56 plane .",
    "we can clearly see that as @xmath18 increases then the width of the distribution function gets wider and randomness effect of magnetic field distribution on the system becomes significantly important .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath18 value causes a decline in the critical temperature @xmath54 of the system .",
    "we note that the critical temperature of the system reaches to zero at @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 for simple cubic @xmath7 , body centered @xmath60 and face centered cubic @xmath61 lattices , respectively . besides",
    ", we have not observed any reentrant / tricritical behavior for single gaussian distribution , or in other words , the system undergoes only a second order phase transition .",
    "@xmath54 value in the absence of any randomness i.e. when @xmath62 is obtained as @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "these values can be compared with the other works in the literature . in table 1 , we see that present work improves the results of the other works . hence , it is obvious that the present method is superior to the other eft methods in the literature .",
    "the reason is due to the fact that , in contrast to the previously published works mentioned above , there is no uncontrolled decoupling procedure used for the higher order correlation functions within the present approximation .",

    "now the shape of the random fields is governed by two parameters @xmath71 and @xmath18 . as shown in preceding results , increasing @xmath18 value",
    "tends to reduce the saturation value of the order parameter and destructs the second order phase transitions by decreasing the critical temperature of the system without exposing any reentrant phenomena for @xmath87 .",
