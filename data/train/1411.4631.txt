    "some time ago , a series of seminal papers @xcite , showed that the universe can undergo quantum tunneling from one local minima of a potential to another .",
    "much more recently , a classical mechanism for vacuum transitions was introduced by @xcite involving coherent collisions between bubble universes . while these processes , both quantum and classical , are of significant theoretical interest in and of themselves , their relevance may be far greater due to the fact that models of inflationary cosmology typically yield numerous expanding bubble universes whose centers of nucleation are sufficiently close to allow for such collisions .",
    "moreover , string theory offers the possibility of an enormous landscape of local minima , making it important to determine if tunneling events and bubble collisions are essential cosmological processes .",
    "these considerations have inspired numerous authors to study transitions between collections of metastable vacua , with results of possible importance to key outstanding issues , such as the cosmological constant problem and the search for experimental signatures of a multiverse @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on aspects of bubble universe collisions . an important observation in this regard was reported in @xcite which found that at sufficiently high relative velocity the physics vastly simplifies .",
    "namely , at at high impact velocity , colliding bubble walls are so lorentz contracted that the time it takes them to pass through one another is less than the time for interactions between the bubbles to contribute significantly .",
    "thus , the field configurations in such situations simply superpose  the  free passage \" approximation .",
    "as the relative velocity of colliding bubbles is proportional to the initial separation between their centers of nucleation , the free passage approximation becomes ever more accurate for ever larger separations .",
    "when free passage holds , there is thus a finite window of time during which the field s value in the widening spatial region through which both walls have passed in opposite directions  the collision region",
    " stays nearly homogeneous .",
    "the field s value in this region is given by the ambient background ( the  parent field value \" ) plus the sum of the field value changes across each bubble wall , i.e. the sum of the bubble field values minus the parent value .",
    "the general expectation is that post free passage , the field will be driven by the slope of the potential at this shifted field value , causing it to settle into the nearest local minimum . thus if the free - passage - kicked field value is in the basin of attraction of a different local minimum ( neither bubble , nor parent )",
    "then the collision will have spawned a new bubble universe in which the field has acquired the new value . to be sure , in @xcite",
    "we pointed out some subtleties in this picture ( in which the strength of the forcing function at the free passage induced field value can be sufficient to pull the field out of the new basin of attraction , causing it to finally settle at the original field value and thus thwarting the creation of a new bubble universe ) , but we anticipate that for many situations , these subtleties will not arise .    to date , studies of bubble collisions have generally considered theories with a single real scalar field described by canonical kinetic terms , and for the most part ignoring gravity @xcite . in many common theoretical scenarios ,",
    "however , bubble collisions occur in theories whose scalar fields parameterize a many - dimensional , curved manifold . for instance , calabi - yau compactifications of string theory involve scalar fields which are local coordinates on moduli spaces that are generally complex khler manifolds with nontrivial curvature  so - called  moduli fields \" .",
    "the string landscape is due , in part , to the various local minima of flux potentials that govern the dynamics of these moduli .    a natural issue ,",
    "then , is the impact of a nontrivial metric on bubble universe collisions , which is the issue we take up in this paper . we address key subtleties in bubble collisions , even at high relative velocity , that arise from the inherent nonlinearity of nontrivial curvature , and find a satisfying geometrical interpretation of our result .",
    "specifically , in section ii we generalize the notion of the free passage approximation from flat to curved field spaces .",
    "we derive a geometrical interpretation of the result in terms of the parallel transport of integral curves on moduli space . in section iii",
    "we argue that there always exists a regime in which our generalized free passage approximation applies , and in section iv we numerically study some bubble collision examples ( in the setting of 1 + 1d ) and compare the results to those from our analytic expressions in section ii .",
    "finally , we end with some conclusions and suggestions for further work .",
    "we take as our starting point the action @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the generally curved metric on the field space .",
    "we assume the potential @xmath2 has three ( or more ) degenerate minima at the field space locations @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ( the minimum necessary to study collisions as a source of vacuum transitions ) .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation takes the form , @xmath6 the @xmath3 vacuum will play the role of the parent vacuum , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 those of the two bubble vacua we seek to collide .",
    "static solutions to ( [ curved - eom ] ) that interpolate between distinct yet degenerate local minima of the potential are solitons .",
    "we define @xmath7 , and @xmath8 as the components of those solitons centered at @xmath9 with the following asymptotics , @xmath10 our intent is to work out the formalism to describe the collisions between these solitons , taking into account the curved moduli space metric .",
    "of particular interest is the limiting behavior that emerges at ultrarelativistic impact velocity .",
    "the collision of two initially widely separated solitons , say , right - moving @xmath11 , and left - moving @xmath12 ( that interpolate between the parent vacuum @xmath3 and the other local minima @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) is described by an observer in the center of the rest frame of the collision by the following initial value problem : @xmath13 where we ve shifted the time coordinate so that the observer s clock is zero when the trajectories of the centers of the colliding solitons ( given by @xmath14 for right - moving @xmath11 , and @xmath15 for left - moving @xmath12 ) coincide .    in order to be a legitimate representation of a soliton collision",
    ", the solitons must be widely separated at the initial time , @xmath16 .",
    "thus , valid values of @xmath17 are those for which @xmath18 is much much greater than the width of all components of both lorentz contracted solitons ( so the observer measures field value @xmath19 to an exceedingly good approximation initially , since outside this width the solitons approach their asymptotic values as decaying exponentials ) . to make this precise we ll define a positive constant @xmath20 such that all components of the solitons we wish to collide , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , differ from the relevant vacuum value by an insignificant amount outside of @xmath21 $ ] . that is , @xmath22    so , the initial time @xmath16 is any time such that @xmath23",
    ". we ll view the collision as commencing at time @xmath24 , and lasting until @xmath25 .",
    "the  usefulness \" then of an approximation to the actual solution to the collision initial value problem ( defined by [ collisionivp ] , [ collisionic1 ] , and [ collisionic2 ] ) , at given impact velocity @xmath26 , is proportional to the fraction of the collision for which the approximation remains valid .",
    "labeling the time until which an approximation accurately captures the dynamics by @xmath27 , the approximation s usefulness is gleaned from @xmath28 .",
    "the greater this is the more useful the approximation is , and it will be deemed  fully realized \" if @xmath29 .",
    "the task of understanding the dynamics of collisions in the ultrarelativistic limit amounts to finding a one parameter family of approximations  free passage field configurations \" we ll denote by @xmath30 that are ever more useful approximations to the collision initial value problem s true solution as @xmath26 is taken to @xmath31 . after constructing @xmath30 we conclude this section with a proof that there always exists an impact velocity close enough to @xmath31 to ensure that the free passage configuration is fully realized .",
    "we first perform a change of variables from @xmath32 and @xmath33 to the natural dynamical variables of the problem , namely the spatial coordinates of the boosted observers riding on the soliton walls , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , which we ll refer to as the lorentz variables .",
    "this choice of variables enables us to isolate the effect of one soliton , say , left - moving @xmath36 , on the field at a fixed location on the other soliton , in this case @xmath37 . by holding @xmath38 constant and letting @xmath39 vary from minus infinity to infinity one focuses on a fixed location on the right - moving soliton and",
    "follows how the field evolves under the influence of the collision with the left - moving soliton .",
    "similarly , the impact of right - moving @xmath37 on @xmath36 can be ascertained by holding @xmath39 constant and varying @xmath38 . expressing @xmath40 in terms of these",
    ", the equation of motion takes the form , @xmath41 - 2\\gamma^2\\epsilon\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi^i}{\\partial\\sigma^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi^i}{\\partial\\omega^2}+\\gamma^i_{j\\thickspace k } \\left(\\frac{\\partial{\\phi}^j}{\\partial\\sigma}\\frac{\\partial{\\phi}^k}{\\partial\\sigma}+ \\frac{\\partial{\\phi}^j}{\\partial\\omega}\\frac{\\partial{\\phi}^k}{\\partial\\omega}\\right)\\right]= -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial { \\phi}_i}\\label{lorentzvarseom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we ve expanded in @xmath42 , since we are interested in the limiting dynamics that emerge when @xmath43 .",
    "rearranging and using @xmath44 we have , @xmath45.\\label{epsparallelpde}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the initial conditions take the form , @xmath46\\bigg|_{\\partial\\omega_\\gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or , @xmath47\\bigg|_{\\partial\\omega_\\gamma}\\label{initialdata2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the surface in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane of constant time @xmath49 .",
    "this boundary is simply the line , @xmath50 , which note lies only in the first , third , and fourth quadrants .",
    "its @xmath39-intercept , @xmath51 , is less than @xmath52 for any valid choice of @xmath17 .",
    "we bisect @xmath48 at the point @xmath53 and name the half that lies in the third and lower fourth quadrants as @xmath54 , and the half that lies in the first and upper fourth quadrants as @xmath55 .",
    "these are indicated in figure [ boundary - split ] by the highlighted yellow , and blue rays , respectively .",
    "since all points on @xmath54 have @xmath56 , they satisfy ,    @xmath57    similarly , all points on @xmath55 have @xmath58 , so their corresponding @xmath38 coordinate satisfies , @xmath59 the boundary conditions can then be rewritten as , @xmath60 thus , the entire collision initial value problem stated in the lorentz variables takes the approximate form : @xmath61\\\\ & \\phi^i(\\sigma,\\omega )   \\bigg|_{\\partial\\omega_f }   \\thickapprox f^i(\\sigma)\\label{approxbc1}\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\sigma}\\phi^i(\\sigma,\\omega)\\bigg|_{\\partial\\omega_f}\\thickapprox{f^i}'(\\sigma)\\label{approxbc2}\\\\ & \\phi^i(\\sigma,\\omega)\\bigg|_{\\partial\\omega_h}\\thickapprox h^i(\\omega)\\label{approxbc3}\\\\ & \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\omega}\\phi^i(\\sigma,\\omega)\\bigg|_{\\partial\\omega_h}\\thickapprox -{h^i}'(-\\omega)\\label{approxbc4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now we ll obtain the limiting form of these equations when @xmath62 . first we ll turn our attention to the boundary conditions . as @xmath63",
    "is increased the boundary @xmath48 is pushed along the diagonal with negative slope toward the fourth quadrant .",
    "this causes the @xmath39 values of points on @xmath54 to become increasingly negative , and the @xmath38 values on @xmath55 to become increasingly positive .",
    "consequently , the approximations made in the boundary conditions ( [ approxbc1 ] , [ approxbc2 ] , [ approxbc3 ] , [ approxbc4 ] ) become ever more accurate .",
    "this can be seen visually as well .",
    "the center of the @xmath37 soliton occurs , by definition , at the @xmath39-intercept of @xmath48 , and the center of the @xmath36 soliton occurs at the @xmath38-intercept . as @xmath48 is pushed along the diagonal toward the fourth quadrant the intercepts move away from each other . the distance between the center of each soliton and the place where the boundary is bisected ( the endpoint of both half boundaries ) increases , resulting in ever more of the @xmath37 soliton fitting on @xmath54 , and the @xmath36 soliton fitting on @xmath55 .",
    "goes to infinity is taken . under a conformal transformation from @xmath38 , and @xmath39 to @xmath64 and",
    "@xmath65 the boundary @xmath48 becomes a hyperbola in the @xmath66 domain ( which is the square @xmath67\\times[-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]$ ] ) .",
    "as @xmath63 is increased the hyperbola is pushed further and further into the lower right of the square , and ultimately becomes the union of the horizontal edge at @xmath68 ( @xmath38 varying edge ) , and the vertical at @xmath69 ( @xmath39 varying edge ) .",
    "though it provides a perhaps a more visually satisfying argument in favor of the split , we do not view the conformal map as necessary . ]",
    "thus , the limiting form of the boundary conditions is obtained by replacing the approximate equalities in [ approxbc1 ] , [ approxbc2 ] , [ approxbc3 ] , and [ approxbc4 ] with equalities .",
    "further , note that the two conditions involving the first derivatives ( [ approxbc2 ] , [ approxbc4 ] ) no longer contain any additional information than what is captured by the two conditions on @xmath70 , ( [ approxbc1 ] , [ approxbc3 ] ) .",
    "clearly the limit of the differential equation , [ epsparallelpde ] , is obtained by dropping the @xmath71 term on the righthand side .    at the risk of stating the obvious",
    "we ll identify this limiting set of equations with the appropriate collision that of the non - lorentz contracted profiles @xmath11 and @xmath12 each propagating toward one another with speed @xmath72 in the _ free _ theory . to see why this is the case ,",
    "take the equation of motion and initial conditions associated with this collision , @xmath73 and transform to the characteristics , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "doing so yields , @xmath76 since the righthand side of the resulting differential equation is _ identically _ zero , we view _ this _ problem as the limit of the original one ( the collision of boosted solitons in the model with nontrivial potential , @xmath77 ) .",
    "so , the approximation to the true solution of the @xmath78 collision problem should be defined by obtaining the solution to the free problem ( [ freepde ] , subject to [ ic1 ] , and [ ic2 ] ) , and then evaluating it at the lorentz variables as opposed to the characteristics .",
    "if we denote the solution to the free problem by @xmath79 , we mean the approximation for impact velocity @xmath26 ought to be defined by , @xmath80 turning our attention to @xmath81 , we note that it maps @xmath82 to a submanifold of the field space manifold , @xmath83 . should be viewed as a map from the square @xmath84 ^ 2 $ ] in the limit that @xmath85 boundary conditions given on the edges of the square defined by @xmath86 for @xmath87 $ ] , and @xmath88 for @xmath89 $ ] . ]",
    "the submanifold is a patch of field space , bounded by four curves .",
    "two of these are simply the original soliton curves ( traced out in field space ) that we are colliding , since @xmath90 for @xmath91 , and @xmath92 for @xmath93 .",
    "significant insight is gained by viewing @xmath81 as the coordinates of two sets of integral curves those of one set obtained by varying the first argument and fixing the second , and those of the second set obtained by fixing the first argument and varying the second .",
    "let us name two vector fields these sets of integral curves define as follows , @xmath94 where we ve expanded in the coordinate basis @xmath95",
    ". expressed in terms of the vector fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the boundary conditions for @xmath81 simply indicate that the vector fields at the relevant two edges of the submanifold line up with the tangent vectors to the two original soliton curves . in an effort to minimize confusion with the negative signs ,",
    "we explicitly point out where the vacuum values are in the submanifold , parameterized by @xmath98 and @xmath99 : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "the differential equation takes the form , @xmath103+u^j\\gamma^i_{j\\thickspace\\ell}\\right)\\\\ & = w^\\ell\\left(e_\\ell[u^i]+u^j\\gamma^i_{j,\\ell}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the equality holds for each component we have , @xmath104e_i+u^j\\gamma^i_{j\\thickspace\\ell}e_i\\right)\\\\ & = w^\\ell\\left(\\nabla_{e_\\ell}(u^i e_i)\\right)\\\\ & = \\left(\\nabla_{w^\\ell e_\\ell}(u^i e_i)\\right)=\\nabla_w u\\label{parallel - trans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , we obtain @xmath105 by the analogous series of steps ( when @xmath98 and @xmath99 are swapped , since [ freepde ] is symmetric under exchange of these ) .",
    "we thus arrive at the geometrical description of bubble collisions in the ultrarelativistic limit : the resulting field profiles post - collision are determined by the mutual parallel transport of each soliton s tangent vector field along that of the other soliton .",
    "that is , the tangent vector fields of the soliton profiles are parallel transported along each other everywhere in @xmath106 .    the remaining two curves that together with @xmath107 , and @xmath108 form the boundary of @xmath106 are simply @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the first of these , @xmath109 , goes between @xmath111 when @xmath112 , and the point @xmath113 . the second ,",
    "@xmath110 , has endpoint @xmath114 when @xmath115 , and the other at @xmath116 as well , when @xmath117 .",
    "this is shown schematically in figure [ submani - fig ] .    , with [ ic1 ] , [ ic2 ] when the limit that the impact velocity goes to @xmath31 is taken .",
    "the solution to this limiting set of equations , denoted by @xmath81 maps @xmath82 to a submanifold , @xmath106 , of the field space @xmath118 .",
    "since the map is smooth the image of the @xmath98 coordinate lines and the @xmath99 coordinate lines are the integral curves of two vector fields .",
    "the partial differential equation [ freepde ] indicates these two vector fields are parallel transported along one another everywhere in @xmath106 .",
    "the initial conditions require that @xmath119 go to @xmath120 as @xmath121 , and go to @xmath122 as @xmath123 .",
    "this is shown in the cartoon / schematic illustration above , where @xmath82 is drawn as a ( finite ) square .",
    "the purple horizontal line in the lower half of the @xmath98-@xmath99 plane is mapped to the purple curve with endpoints at @xmath4 and @xmath3 in the @xmath124 coordinate plane(@xmath37 soliton ) , and the green vertical line in the right half plane is mapped to the green curve with endpoints @xmath5 and @xmath3 ( @xmath36 soliton ) . the remaining two curves that form the rest of the boundary of @xmath106 are shown in blue and pink .",
    "they are the images of the @xmath98 coordinate line at @xmath125 and @xmath99 coordinate line at @xmath126 , so are in a sense the curves obtained by completing the transport of @xmath36 along @xmath37 and @xmath37 along @xmath36 . at sufficiently high impact velocity the field in the collision region takes on value @xmath127 , and the outgoing walls interpolate between @xmath127 and the original bubble vacua , @xmath4 to the right and @xmath5 to the left .",
    "for such a collision the parametric plot of the two walls differs negligibly from the prediction via parallel transport the blue and pink curves . ]",
    "this result agrees with heuristic expectations motivated by the flat field space limit .",
    "namely , note that in the flat limit , a right moving soliton that interpolates between the parent vacuum @xmath3 and a local minimum @xmath4 leaves in its wake ( to the left of the soliton s transition wall ) a field value shifted by @xmath128 = @xmath129 , while a left moving soliton that interpolates between the parent vacuum @xmath3 and a local minimum @xmath5 leaves in its wake ( to the right of the soliton s transition wall ) a field value shifted by @xmath130 = @xmath131 .",
    "thus , after free - passage collision , the collision region  which , by definition is to the left of the right - mover and to the right of the left - mover  is shifted by @xmath132 ( which equals @xmath133 ) . in the case of curved field space , we divide the field shifts , both @xmath128 and @xmath130 , into infinitesimals , which geometrically are the tangent vector fields of the soliton field profiles .",
    "each such infinitesimal leaves in its immediate wake a field whose value is parallel transported along the infinitesimal shift vector , thus resulting in the geometrical picture we ve described . when all tangent vectors of nontrivial magnitude have been mutually transported , they leave a widening interior of field in @xmath134 .",
    "this type of reasoning indicates that [ parallel - trans ] is the simplest partial differential equation that reduces to free passage in the flat field space limit .",
    "namely , in the flat limit , the infinitesimal description of free passage is clearly the requirement that the vanishing of the directional derivatives of @xmath96 with respect to @xmath97 and @xmath97 with respect to @xmath96 .",
    "the covariant version of these statements is just [ parallel - trans ] .",
    "this heuristic argument is suggestive but not sufficient since it is insensitive to any terms in the limiting form of the partial differential equation that vanish in the flat field space limit but which could nonetheless be present in the curved case .",
    "the analysis we ve performed so far , together with that in the following section verifies that there are no such terms .",
    "it is worth confirming that our free passage field configuration , [ fp - definition ] , does indeed have the qualitative features outlined above .",
    "first note that the configuration correctly approaches the @xmath4 vacuum asymptotically to the left , and the @xmath5 vacuum to the right for any finite time @xmath32 , since this amounts to evaluating @xmath135 at @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , respectively . at a fixed time _ before _",
    "collision , any time @xmath138 , the free passage field differs from @xmath4 vacuum by an insignificant amount at @xmath139 since we d effectively be evaluating @xmath81 in [ fp - definition ] at @xmath140 . as we march rightward the first argument increases , and reaches zero at @xmath141 while second argument remains essentially unchanged .",
    "@xmath142 is simply the center of the @xmath37 soliton .",
    "so , as one moves between the positions @xmath143 , and @xmath144 in free passage field configuration they run through the @xmath37 soliton s field configuration .",
    "if they continue moving rightward they ll reach a stretch of @xmath33 values where both the arguments of @xmath81 in [ fp - definition ] are effectively negative infinity , and so the @xmath3 vacuum is measured .",
    "if we continue on rightward the analogous procedure leads us to realize that the free passage field configuration interpolates between the @xmath3 and @xmath5 vacua by the ( reflected ) @xmath36 soliton , centered at @xmath145 .",
    "so , pre - collision the spatial profile of the free passage field configuration looks like the usual linear superposition : a nearly homogeneous interior of diminishing size in the parent vacuum , separated from the bubble vacua by the relevant solitons , whose centers lie at @xmath146 , and @xmath145 .    the same line of reasoning can be used to deduce that post - collision , any time @xmath147 , the free passage configuration again consists of three approximately homogeneous regions : a widening interior , or  collision region \" with field value @xmath148 , separated from regions of original bubble vacua on either side , by walls whose centers follow the same trajectories @xmath149 .",
    "the shapes however of the spatial profiles of the field components across the walls are _ not _ in general the same as those of the incoming solitons . a parametric plot of the free passage configuration at a given time ( with the spatial variable as the parameter ) in the @xmath124 coordinate plane would consist of the composition of a curve that interpolates between @xmath4 and @xmath127 , together with the one between @xmath5 and @xmath127 .",
    "these would be nearly identical those obtained by completing parallel transport , and approaches the union of these two curves , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 asymptotically as @xmath152 .",
    "we claim that there always exists an impact velocity sufficiently close to the speed of light such that the actual solution to [ collisionivp ] is well approximated by the above free passage evolution throughout the entirety of the collision i.e. for longer than the amount of time it would take for the incoming lorentz contracted walls to fully pass through each other .",
    "we prove this in the following section .",
    "the solution to the parallel transport problem , @xmath81 , and the free passage evolution function defined from it , @xmath153 , is , of course , only useful in predicting the outcome of a particular collision if deviations from @xmath153 remain sufficiently small throughout the entirety of the collision ( or longer ) . as we ve mentioned previously , the amount of time it takes the solitons to fully pass through each other is @xmath154 , and since we ve chosen to set our @xmath155 at the middle of the collision we re interested in the time period , @xmath156 $ ] .",
    "we begin by expanding the actual solution ( to [ collisionivp ] ) about the free passage configuration , @xmath157 simply substituting [ expansion ] into the equation of motion and expanding in powers of @xmath158 yields , @xmath159\\\\ & -2\\gamma^i_{j k}|_{\\phi_{fp}}\\partial_\\mu\\phi_{fp}^j \\partial^\\mu\\psi^k-\\gamma^i_{j k,\\ell}|_{\\phi_{fp}}\\psi^\\ell \\partial_\\mu\\phi^j_{fp } \\partial^\\mu\\phi^k_{fp}+\\mathcal{o}(\\psi(\\partial\\psi))+\\mathcal{o}((\\partial\\psi)^2)\\\\ & = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial\\phi_i}\\bigg|_{\\phi_{fp}}\\negthickspace\\negthickspace\\negthickspace\\negthickspace-\\left[\\box\\phi^i_{fp}+\\gamma^i_{j k}|_{\\phi_{fp } } \\partial_\\mu\\phi^j_{fp } \\partial^\\mu\\phi^k_{fp } \\right]+\\mathcal{o}(\\psi ) \\label{greenfn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can write an implicit expression for @xmath160 by integrating the right hand side of [ greenfn ] as follows , @xmath161 we now truncate at zeroth order in @xmath158 , and bound the above integral .",

    "this is identical to the step we took at the outset to obtain [ lorentzvarseom ] .",
    "note that the first term in square brackets on the righthand side of @xmath166 is , by definition , zero . the second term , however",
    ", does not vanish .",
    "it results from the mismatch between the lorentz variables and the characteristics .",
    "the nonvanishing piece can be expressed in terms of the vector fields @xmath96 and @xmath97 as follows , @xmath167=-2\\gamma^2\\epsilon\\left[\\left(\\nabla_u u\\right)^i+\\left(\\nabla_w w\\right)^i\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a bound on the magnitude of @xmath168 can now be computed straightforwardly , @xmath169 where the terms involving the vector fields are evaluated at @xmath170 .",
    "now , we re only interested in the deviation at points @xmath33 in the collision region ( outside of here the field persists very nearly equal to the bubble vacuum field values ) , and times @xmath171 $ ] . for this time period the collision region",
    "is always contained within @xmath172 $ ] .",
    "this means the @xmath173 interval we need to integrate over in our expression for @xmath160 is always contained within @xmath174 $ ] .",
    "so we can write , @xmath175 so , @xmath176 where the positive constants , @xmath177 are finite due to the smoothness of the potential and the field space manifold .",
    "since the difference in the coordinates of the true field configuration and free passage configuration can be made arbitrarily small , we conclude that the post collision field ( for any two solitons in any curved multi - scalar field theory ) successfully realizes the late - time free passage field configuration , provided the impact velocity was sufficiently relativistic .",
    "the threshold above which the impact velocity ought to be is dependent on both the model and the choice of the two colliding solitons . this threshold can be estimated by requiring that the distance in field space between the free passage field ( say for the center of the collision region ) at time @xmath32 , and the free passage plus deviation location be much much smaller than the length of the path the observer at the center of the collision region has through field space from the parent vacuum until time @xmath32 . since the walls of bubbles nucleated via coleman - de luccia tunneling accelerate as they move outwards , we expect our parallel transport procedure to be a useful means of predicting the field configuration following the collision of two bubbles , provided they were nucleated sufficiently far apart ( and they re radii upon nucleation is sufficiently small compared to the separation distance such that high enough impact velocity is reached upon collision ) .",
    "we simulated soliton collisions at a variety of impact velocities in three different models with actions of the form [ action ] .",
    "each model featured a different two dimensional curved field space .",
    "we reiterate that the field space is curved in the sense that the matrix of @xmath124 dependent functions , @xmath178 , in the noncanonical kinetic term in the lagrangian is the coordinate representation of the metric on a curved manifold ( clearly the field components @xmath124 are identified as coordinates on the manifold ) .",
    "the particular manifolds we considered were the sphere , the ring torus , and the ",
    "teardrop\" our own creation named for obvious reasons .    for both the sphere and teardrop we used the polar angle and azimuthal angle as our two coordinates . for the torus we used the angles about the major axis , and the minor axis . to minimize the possibility for confusion we adopt standard naming conventions used for these coordinate systems , and refer to the field components ( @xmath179 ) as ( @xmath180 ) for the sphere and teardrop , and as ( @xmath181 ) for the torus . for the explicit form of the metric components , as well as vacuum locations refer to table , [ models - table ] .    .metric components and vacuum locations [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ potentials - table ]",
    "lastly it is necessary to discuss how the initial conditions and boundary conditions were formulated . both are defined in terms of the components of the two solitons we are colliding .",
    "solitons are , by definition , static solutions to the equations of motion [ curved - eom ] that approach two distinct ( obviously degenerate ) minima of the potential asymptotically . in a multi - scalar field theory solitons",
    "are unique to the vacua they interpolate between , and furthermore are the minimum energy field configurations that satisfy the given pair of boundary conditions .",
    "since the coupled ordinary differential equations that define the solitons are nonlinear , analytic solutions generally can not be found .",
    "however , if an initial profile that satisfies the boundary conditions is evolved in time by the equations of motion plus a damping term , the profile ultimately settles down to the soliton , provided the initial guess was sufficiently close to the true soliton and the damping coefficient was not too large .",
    "we performed this relaxation procedure numerically , once again with ndsolve in mathematica . , and the potential , between the minima were nearly identical for the .",
    "for example , for the sphere initial guess we d compute @xmath182 numerically and tune the double well potential s curvature parameter until its integral matched this .",
    "the double well approximation then provides us with an initial guess , a ( scaled and shifted ) hyperbolic tangent , for one of the two soliton components that which the geodesic is parameterized in terms of . to obtain a guess for the remaining component the expression for the geodesic",
    "was simply evaluated at the guess function that was just obtained for the former component resulting in a spatial profile . ]",
    "note that analytic expressions for the four soliton components , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , were needed in order for simulations of the collision to be feasible . at such small grid spacing time",
    "evolving initial conditions constructed out of the interpolating functions relaxation yielded was not possible .",
    "so the final step was to engineer analytic expressions that approximated each of the soliton components from relaxation ( four total , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 ) .",
    "all were modifications of ( scaled and shifted ) hyperbolic tangents , typically with the addition of small gaussians and nonlinear terms in the argument of the hyperbolic tangent .",
    "the free passage field configuration was indeed fully realized in all three models at sufficiently large impact velocity .",
    "snapshots of the spatial profile of each field components during such collisions can be found in figures [ snapshots - tear ] .",
    "note that each field component s collision region is homogenous , with the precise value predicted by the parallel transport solution , indicated by the contrasting dashed line .",

    "in this paper we pushed the understanding of bubble universe collisions one step forward by considering the impact of working in the context of a curved field space .",
