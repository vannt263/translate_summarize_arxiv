    "for many years , there has been much interest in characterizing and understanding complex networks in nature strogatz01,albertbarabasi02,dorogovtsevmendes02,newman03,estradafoxhighamoppo10 .",
    "while much of the venerable network literature is devoted to static aspects ( e.g. , graph theory ) , interest in their dynamic aspects began to emerge recently @xcite , especially in the context of adaptive co - evolutionary networks grossdcbb06,grossblasius08 .",
    "now , in the settings of both artificial structures and natural environments , networks of very different kinds are intimately entangled , e.g. , the internet and transportation networks , ocean currents and marine food - webs , etc .",
    "thus , understanding how diverse , interdependent networks interact is also important .",
    "while some work along such lines rinaldipeerenboomkelly01,panzierisetola08,buldyrevparshanipaulstanleyhavlin10,vespignani10,buldyrevsherecwilich11,kurantthiran06 exists , the overall picture is far from clear . within this context ,",
    "our goal is modest : what are the effects of coupling _ dynamic _ networks of a similar type , but with different characteristics ?",
    "to focus our effort , we limit ourselves to a special class of dynamic networks , in which a node can cut or add links to the others .",
    "various dynamics of this sort are possible .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . ) here , though , nodes alter their links in an attempt to achieve a ` preferred ' number ( @xmath11 ) of connections .",
    "we believe that the notion of preferred degrees is particularly suitable for modeling networks in a social setting , in which introverts / extroverts are naturally inclined to have few / many contacts .",
    "while such a model may be applicable to the dynamics of opinion formation , it is also ideal for studying the effects of self - imposed or public policies , in the event of an epidemic outbreak , by including a time dependent @xmath11 .",
    "thus , an individual s preferred degree may drop by an order of magnitude or more , e.g. , from hundreds of contacts during a typical day , to just a few family members or care - givers .",
    "introduced a few years ago @xcite , we recently began more systematic studies on interacting networks with preferred degrees , the present being the third of a series .",
    "in the first @xcite , we provided specifics of how to implement a preferred degree for a homogeneous population of individuals , introducing various natural ways to incorporate the action of cutting / adding a link . with simple arguments",
    ", we can predict the degree distribution , @xmath12 , which agrees well with simulation results . to model interactions , we considered two such communities , with different numbers ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath11 s , and introduced a simple way to couple them : when a node attempts to add / cut a link , it chooses a partner from the other community with probability @xmath14 ( and an intra - community partner with @xmath15 ) for the action .",
    "though such a model seems minimal , the complexities involved include a six - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath16 ) and the presence of four degree distributions of interest ( associated with intra- and inter - community links ) . despite its simplistic appearance",
    ", this model displays some surprising phenomena . in the second of the series @xcite",
    ", we performed a more detailed study in a wider region of parameter space and arrived at some general principles to predict the observed behavior .",
    "nevertheless , since the dynamics does not obey detailed balance , determining the microscopic distribution in the stationary state ( @xmath17 ,  la the boltzmann distribution for systems in equilibrium ) is a major challenge , let alone computing averages of macroscopic observables . in this paper , we consider a special limit of a system with two communities .",
    "dubbed the _",
    "xie _ model",
    ", it consists of a collection of e__x__treme _ _ i__ntroverts and _ _ e__xtroverts , whose only action is either cutting a link or making one .",
    "this simplifying assumption means the model has only two control parameters , @xmath1 , the number of introverts and extroverts . as the @xmath8 line is crossed , a remarkably sharp transition emerges .",
    "it turns out that detailed balance is restored in this limit and so , we are able to arrive at an explicit expression for @xmath17 . though computing averages with @xmath17 is still difficult , various mean - field techniques can be applied and some aspects of this model can be well understood . in particular , the transition appears to be of mixed order and is likely to be in the class of an ` extreme ' thouless effect @xcite.while preliminary results have been reported earlier @xcite , we will present a more systematic study of this model here .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we provide a detailed description of the model , the master equation associated with the stochastic process , and the exact microscopic distribution in the steady state .",
    "the following section is devoted to studies of the degree distributions , through both monte carlo simulations and a self - consistent mean - field theory . in simulations with @xmath18 fixed at @xmath19 and varying @xmath20",
    ", we find good agreement with the theory _ except _ the @xmath21 case .",
    "this surprising result leads us to explore , in section @xmath22 , the behavior of a genuinely macroscopic quantity , @xmath23 , the total number of cross - links .",
    "we end with a summary and outlook .",
    "in our previous studies @xcite , we introduced adaptive networks in which each node adds / cuts links to other nodes according to its ` preferred degree ' ( @xmath11 ) for both a homogeneous population and a heterogeneous system of two communities with different characteristics ( e.g. , numbers of nodes and @xmath11 s ) .",
    "for the reader s convenience , we summarize briefly here the specifications and the findings for the simplest model , the extreme limit of which is the focus of this study .",
    "first , we consider a homogeneous population consisting of a dynamic set of links among @xmath24 nodes , all of which are assigned the same @xmath11 . in each time step , a random node is chosen and its degree , @xmath25 , is noted .",
    "if @xmath26 , the node cuts one of its existing links at random . otherwise , it adds a link to a randomly chosen node not connected to it .",
    "( models with more ` flexibility ' in the nodes were studied in @xcite . )",
    "this simple stochastic process is ergodic , so that the system eventually settles into a unique stationary distribution , @xmath27 over the space of networks ",
    "symmetric @xmath28 adjacency matrices , @xmath29 .",
    "despite the apparent randomness , the resulting degree distribution is a laplacian , @xmath30 $ ] , which differs considerably from the binomial distribution ( i.e. , gaussian or poisson , in the limit of large @xmath24 ) in erds - rnyi graphs @xcite .",
    "second , since our goal is interaction of networks , we turn to a study of two networks of preferred degrees . assuming that @xmath31 , naturally we refer to the first group as ` introverts ' ( @xmath4 ) and the later one as ` extroverts ' ( @xmath5 ) . to model the interaction between these groups",
    ", we introduced a simple parameter @xmath32 $ ] , which is the probability for the chosen node to take action ( adding or cutting ) on a cross - link .",
    "letting @xmath33 as well as @xmath34 , we find a variety of behaviors @xcite , some of which can be understood , at least qualitatively .",
    "the most surprising phenomenon observed concerns the statistical properties of the number of cross - links , @xmath23 . specifically , we simulated two communities with identical properties : @xmath35 . in the stationary state ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath23 ( dropping superscript @xmath36 for simplicity and denoted by @xmath37 ) displays a very broad and flat plateau .",
    "by contrast , we can arbitrarily partition a _ homogeneous _ population of @xmath38 into two equal halves . using @xmath39 and defining @xmath23 as the number of links between the halves , we find that @xmath40 is just a binomial distribution , with easily predictable parameters .",
    "as the standard deviation of the former is an order of magnitude larger than the binomial , it is clear that , despite its conceptual simplicity , coupling two networks via @xmath41 has a profound effect on the system .",
    "the underlying dynamics of these systems violates detailed balance . as a result",
    ", the stationary state will be a non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) , in the sense that persistent probability currents will prevail @xcite .",
    "thus , we encounter serious challenges in our attempts to understand analytically these dramatically different behaviors . nevertheless , we believe some insight into our interacting networks can be gained by turning to limiting cases which embody the main features of the full system . in this spirit , we consider the ultimate limit : @xmath42 . in other words , these are etreme ntroverts and xtroverts ( or @xmath0 , for short ) .",
    "the rules can not be simpler : when chosen to act , an introvert will cut a random existing link , while an extrovert will add a link to a random individual in the population not already connected . to implement monte carlo simulations , one significant simplification is evident .",
    "the two intra - communities will quickly end in a null and a complete graph , and only the @xmath4-@xmath5 cross - links are dynamic . with all intra - community links frozen ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ nodes ] ) , our active network reduces to bipartite graphs and the configuration space of our system reduces to incidence matrices , @xmath43 , i.e. , a @xmath44 rectangle in the full adjacency matrix , @xmath29 .",
    "therefore , instead of having to consider @xmath45 configurations , we can focus on only @xmath46 configurations , where@xmath47is the maximum number of cross - links allowed .",
    "given the evolution rules , there are only two control parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , in our model .",
    "though this system may appear to be minimal and devoid of interest , we find surprising features associated with @xmath23 as well as the degree distributions . in particular",
    ", there is an extraordinary phase boundary along the @xmath8 line .",
    "let us denote an element of @xmath43  by @xmath48 , which is @xmath49or @xmath50 when the link between an introvert node @xmath51 and an extrovert @xmath52 is present or absent , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath53 $ ] and @xmath54 $ ] . from the microscopic @xmath48 ,",
    "various quantities of interest can be formed , e.g. , @xmath55 . at another level , the degree of an @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) node ,",
    "can be obtained by summing @xmath56 along a row ( column ) . to expose a not - so - explicit symmetry",
    ", we consider the _ complement _ of a degree , namely , the number of links ( associated with a particular node ) _ less _ than the maximum possible value ( i.e. , @xmath57 ) .",
    "this measure is especially suited for characterizing an @xmath5 node . letting @xmath58 , we define@xmath59 which are the degree of an @xmath4 node @xmath51 and the complement of the degree of an @xmath5 node @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "note that , for the @xmath0 model , @xmath60 $ ] and @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "meanwhile , the dynamics correspond to changing an element of @xmath43 from @xmath62 to @xmath50 or vice versa . mapping this binary variable to @xmath63 ,",
    "our model becomes a kinetic ising model with spin flip dynamics @xcite . in the lattice gas language @xcite",
    ", @xmath64 is the number of particles in row @xmath51 , while @xmath65 is the number of holes in column @xmath52 .",
    "similar to the ising case ( but with an additional exchange operation ) , the key symmetry here is @xmath66which we will refer to as ` particle - hole symmetry . '",
    "a layman s way to phrase this symmetry is : the presence of a link is as intolerable to an introvert as the absence of one ( i.e. , presence of a ` hole ' ) to an extrovert",
    ". this symmetry will play an important role in discussions below .",
    "in particular , it behooves us to characterize the state of an extrovert by a ` hole distribution'@xmath67rather than the standard degree distribution , @xmath12 .",
    "a complete analytical description of the @xmath0 model is given by @xmath68 , which is the probability of finding the system in configuration @xmath43 after @xmath69 steps , starting with initial configuration @xmath70 .",
    "( in simulations , we typically let @xmath70 be the null matrix or a randomly half filled one .",
    "but , since our main interest will be properties of the stationary state , we will drop the @xmath71 part . )",
    "the discrete master equation for @xmath72 can be written:@xmath73 \\label{me}\\]]where @xmath74 is the probability for configuration @xmath75 to become @xmath43 in a step ( attempt ) . using ( [ kpbar ] ) , @xmath76 can be easily written : @xmath77   \\label{rates}\\]]where @xmath78 is the heavyside function ( i.e. , @xmath62 if @xmath79 and @xmath50 if @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 ensures that only @xmath48 may change in a step",
    ". with such a random sequential scheme , each node has an even chance of being chosen after @xmath24 attempts .",
    "thus , @xmath24 attempts is often referred to as one monte carlo step ( mcs ) , so that a run of @xmath82 mcs involves @xmath83 ` spin - flip attempts . '",
    "the dynamics defined here is clearly ergodic .",
    "more remarkable is that it obeys detailed balance , as shown in appendix a. consequently , in the @xmath84 limit , @xmath72 approaches a unique stationary distribution , @xmath17 , while all probability currents vanish .",
    "more crucially , detailed balance allows us to find @xmath17 by applying @xmath85 repeatedly .",
    "imposing normalization , we arrive at an explicit closed form : @xmath86where @xmath87 is a ` partition function . '",
    "note that the particle - hole symmetry ( c.f . eqn .",
    "[ ph - sym ] ) is manifest here .",
    "interpreting @xmath17 as a boltzmann factor , we can write a ` hamiltonian ' can be cast as @xmath88 but this form is hardly a simplification . ]",
    "@xmath89now , this form immediately alerts us to the level of complexity of this system of ` ising spins , ' as @xmath90 contains a peculiar form of long range interactions .",
    "each ` spin ' is coupled to all other ` spins ' _ in its row and column _ , via all possible types of ` multi - spin ' interactions !",
    "we are not aware of any system in solid state physics with this kind of interactions .",
    "yet , @xmath90 exposes the underlying structure of ( a limit of ) a very simple model of social interactions .",
    "meanwhile , it is understandable that computing @xmath91 , let alone statistical properties of macroscopic quantities , will be quite challenging .",
    "nevertheless , as the next two sections show , we are able to exploit mean - field approaches to predict various quantities , for generic points in the space of control parameters : @xmath92 . as in standard equilibrium statistical systems",
    ", our mean - field theory fails in the neighborhood of critical points , which turn out to be the @xmath8 line here .    ) and red closed ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the black lines represent the active cross - links and the red lines , the frozen @xmath5-@xmath5 links . for this network ,",
    "the sets of @xmath25 s are : @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , this configuration contributes @xmath95 to @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 to @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) , respectively.,width=336 ]",
    "in this section , we focus on a quantity most commonly studied in networks : the degree distribution , @xmath101 .",
    "of course , there are several types of @xmath102 s for a system with @xmath103 subgroups or communities . if @xmath104 denotes the number of nodes in group @xmath105 connected to a node in group @xmath106 ( i.e. , the links @xmath106 has to @xmath105 ) , then , in general , @xmath107 .",
    "instead , we have @xmath108 as the average number of all the links between subgroups @xmath106 and @xmath105 , while the numbers of nodes in each , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are not necessarily equal .",
    "thus , we have @xmath111 degree distributions in general . for @xmath0 however , the internal links , @xmath112 , are static with trivial distributions ( e.g. , @xmath113 ) .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to describe each subgroup by just one degree distribution , associated with @xmath114 and @xmath115 . for simplicity",
    ", we will denote these as @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively ( e.g. , @xmath118 and @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ nodes ] ) . in view of the particle - hole symmetry discussed above , we will often consider @xmath120 instead .      our main goal is to demonstrate that interesting phenomena can emerge from a minimal model like @xmath0 , and that they can be understood reasonably well by mean - field analysis , rather than a systematic and exhaustive study of this particular system .",
    "thus , we restrict our simulation studies mainly to @xmath123 , a number large enough to show collective behavior , yet small enough for gathering good statistics . starting with a network with various initial conditions ( null graph , complete graph , random half - filled ) ,",
    "we evolve the system according to the simple rules given above . not surprisingly , after @xmath124 mcs , all the @xmath4-@xmath4 links are absent while all the @xmath5-@xmath5 links are present . to be quite certain that the system has equilibrated",
    ", we discard the first @xmath125 mcs .",
    "thereafter , we measure the degrees of each node every @xmath126 mcs .",
    "the distributions are then obtained as the average over @xmath127 measurements .",
    "as our main focus is not the transient behavior , but rather only steady state properties , we will drop the superscripts @xmath36 to simplify notation .",
    "the degree distributions , @xmath12 , for three cases  @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130  are shown in fig .",
    "[ dd](a ) .",
    "evidently , each @xmath102 consists of two disjoint components , associated with small / large @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that , since the @xmath4 s are only linked to the @xmath5 s , the distribution associated with @xmath131 can be attributed to @xmath132 .",
    "similarly , since all @xmath5-@xmath5 links are present , @xmath133 can be identified with the component with @xmath134 . for these cases ,",
    "there is no overlap at @xmath135 so that we can label @xmath136 and @xmath137 without ambiguity : open and solid symbols respectively .",
    "apart from having these two components , the most prominent feature is that neither component resembles @xmath138 , the degree distribution of a homogeneous population with preferred degree @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "as will be shown , they are well approximated by poisson distributions , the analytic result of a mean - field approach .    of course , the averages obey @xmath139 , especially since they must satisfy@xmath140which is the average of the total number of cross - links : @xmath141 .",
    "meanwhile , we can expect that , since each node is given the same chance to act , all these averages will increase as the ratio @xmath142 increases .",
    "other than these obvious aspects , a casual glance shows several surprising features .",
    "for example , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 for the @xmath136 s in fig .",
    "[ dd](a ) , associated with , respectively , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "naively , @xmath149 and @xmath150 may be thought of as the probability of adding and cutting a cross - link , leading to the expectation that the ratio @xmath151 $ ] ( presence / absence of link ) is @xmath142 .",
    "a little algebra leads further to the prediction @xmath152 , i.e. , approximately @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 .",
    "needless to say , this naive picture is far from realized .    before considering a more successful theoretical approach , we present the system s behavior for @xmath156 . in fig .  [",
    "dd](b ) , we illustrate the degree distribution for @xmath157 ( blue circles ) , as well as the previous case of @xmath158 ( green circles ) . in other words , just two introverts have ` changed sides ' here .",
    "the first remarkable feature is the sizeable jump , easily discerned by focusing on say , the two @xmath136 s , shown with open symbols .",
    "the other notable feature is the symmetry , which can be traced to the underlying ` particle - hole symmetry . ' by exchanging @xmath159 and plotting the degree distribution _",
    "vs_. @xmath160 , we find excellent overlap between the blue and green data points .",
    "of course , such a plot displays @xmath161 , the ` hole distribution . '",
    "the two components , denoted by open and solid diamonds , can be associated with the separate distributions @xmath121 and @xmath99 , respectively.,width=336 ]    finally , let us turn to the symmetric case @xmath162 , which appears to be most challenging , for both monte carlo simulations and theoretical understanding .",
    "first of all , the run time it takes for the system to settle is much longer , typically a hundred - fold longer than the @xmath163 cases . to compile a reliable histogram for the @xmath12 , shown in fig .",
    "[ 100dd ] , we take @xmath164 measurements in a combination of @xmath165 runs , each of which lasts for @xmath166 mcs ( after discarding the first @xmath167 mcs for the system to settle into steady states ) . note that , to untangle @xmath168 in the central pair of points , we recorded separately whether an @xmath4 or a @xmath5 node has @xmath169 links .",
    "of course , the distribution is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath170 .",
    "the unexpected aspect is the presence of broad and flat plateaux , quantitative understanding of which remains elusive . as will be discussed in section @xmath22 , models with @xmath8 can be regarded as critical systems in which large fluctuations and critical slowing down can be typically expected . in the next subsection , we will sidestep this problematic case and focus only on systems with @xmath163 , for which a mean - field approach proves to be quite successful .",
    "given the exact steady state distribution ( eqn .",
    "( [ p * ] ) ) , the @xmath102 s can be computed , in principle , via@xmath171(for any @xmath51 in the first equation and any @xmath52 in the second ) . in practice , this task is extremely challenging . in particular , since @xmath172 correspond to , in a 2-dimensional ising model , the total mangetization in a row or a column , it is understandable that computing their full _ distributions _ is beyond our reach .",
    "thus , we resort to a mean - field approach , applied to the underlying _ dynamics _ of the model @xcite . in other words ,",
    "we implement an approximation scheme on the transition probabilities for the degree of a _",
    "particular _ node to increase / decrease by unity : @xmath173 .",
    "once these are determined , the _ approximate _ ( signified with a tilde above ) steady state degree distribution must satisfy@xmath174and can be found in closed form .",
    "specifically , we first consider a particular @xmath4 node , with @xmath175 being the probability to find it having @xmath176 links .",
    "then , provided @xmath177 , @xmath178 which is the probability that this node is chosen to act . by contrast , the exact rate for having a link added ( @xmath179 ) is more complicated , since it depends not only on all the @xmath180 extroverts _ not _ connected to it , but also on how many ` holes ' each has  through @xmath181 ( in eqn .  ( [ rates ] ) ) . to proceed ,",
    "we must make judicious approximations . in the spirit of mean - field theory",
    ", we can replace @xmath181 by the average @xmath182 , where the prime stands for an average _ restricted _ to nodes with @xmath183 .",
    "though we can formulate the theory with @xmath184 , let us make a further simplifying approximation and replace it by @xmath185 .",
    "so , we write@xmath186if we had the distribution of an extrovert s holes , @xmath187 , then we have the following relation:@xmath188of course , since @xmath189 is unknown , so is @xmath190 . as will be shown , the goal of a self - consistent mean - field theory is to find an approximate expression for these distributions , as well as for @xmath136 .",
    "proceeding , we exploit eqn .",

    ", we turn to a particular @xmath5 node and , exploiting ` particle - hole ' symmetry , consider its hole distribution , @xmath190 . since adding a link is decreasing @xmath200 by unity , we again have @xmath201 , the probability that this node is chosen to act , provided @xmath183 .",
    "meanwhile , it is connected to @xmath202 ( i.e. , @xmath203 ) introverts , each of which has @xmath64 links .",

    "this remarkably simple , yet quite rich , system deserves to be investigated further",
    ". the most obvious question may be whether a thermodynamic limit exists , and in what way .",
    "for example , do the degree distributions approach a non - trivial limit when @xmath322 ? with @xmath361",
    "held fixed or with @xmath20 being a constant ? as a function of @xmath362 or",
    "some scaled variable ? despite the presence of an explicit expression for the microscopic distribution and its associated @xmath90 , computing the partition function , let alone averages of quantities of interest , poses a worthy challenge . the failure of mean - field theory , especially near ` criticality ' hints at the importance of correlations .",
    "preliminary studies indicate strong correlations , in the sense that the difference between the joint distribution , @xmath363 , and the product @xmath364 can be a sizeable fraction of the former .",
    "systematic investigations of them are straightforward and surely worthwhile . presumably , once some progress along these directions is made , it is possible to investigate the more serious issues concerning the nature of the mixed - order transition .",
    "for example , can we understand and predict the absence of _ _ any _ _ * *  * * barrier ( in the symmetric system ) between the degenerate extremes ? launching a systematic study of finite size scaling will also help to shed light on such peculiarities of this model .",
    "of course , we should also pursue the questions raised above , e.g. , details of the power spectra , especially for systems with @xmath365 . in an earlier paper of this series @xcite",
    ", we introduced a quantitative concept of ` frustration ' ( in the ordinary psychological sense ) .",
    "though @xmath0 seems to be a maximally frustrated model , its role and behavior are yet to be considered .    beyond exploring these questions",

    "we may treat @xmath90 as a genuine hamiltonian in a standard study of critical phenomena in thermal equilibrium .",

    ", work is in progress @xcite to explore the usual avenues of interest : static and dynamic critical exponents , scaling functions , universality and the classes , etc . in the context of renormalization group analyses ( which proved to be highly effective in dealing with other mixed - order transitions @xcite ) , we already know that @xmath90 lies on the critical sheet and can inquire about fixed points and their neighborhoods , irrelevant and relevant variables ( e.g. , if there are others besides @xmath373 and @xmath105 ) .",
    "similarly , we might ask if the perspectives from catastrophe theory @xcite can offer fresh insight .    beyond the @xmath0 and its companion model , there is a wide vista involving dynamic networks with preferred degrees . for instance , instead of assigning one or two @xmath11 s to a population , it is surely more natural to assign a distribution of @xmath11 s",
    ". there are also multiple ways to model interactions between the various groups .",
    "for example , even with just two groups , it is realistic to believe that an individual may have _ two _ preferred degrees , one for contacts within the group and another for those outside .",
    "surely , this kind of differential preference underlies the formation of social cliques . beyond understanding the topology and dynamics of interacting networks of the types described here ,",
    "the next natural step is to take into account the freedom associated with the nodes , e.g. , opinion , wealth , health , etc .",
    ", on the way to the ambitious goal of understanding adaptive , co - evolving , interdependent networks in general .",
    "in this appendix , we show that all kolmogorov loops are reversible in the xie model and so , detailed balance is restored @xcite .",
    "since the full dynamics occurs on the @xmath374 cross - links , the configuration space consists of the corners of an @xmath374-dimensional unit cube , while adding / cutting a link is associated to traverse along an edge therein .",
    "clearly , products of the ratios of forward and reversed transition rates around any closed loop can be expressed in terms of those around ` elementary loops ' ",
    "i.e. , loops around a plaquette on the @xmath374-cube .",
    "we will show that the ratio associated with every plaquette is unity and so , all kolmogorov loops are reversible .",
    "first , it is easy to see that if an elementary loop consists of modifying two links connected to four different nodes , then the actions on each link are unaffected by the other . in other words ,",
    "rates associated with opposite sides of the square ( loop ) are the same .",
    "thus , their product in one direction is necessarily the same as in the reverse .",
    "we need to focus only on situations where the two links are connected to three nodes , e.g. , @xmath375 and @xmath376 . for any such loop ,",
    "let us start with a configuration in which both are absent ( @xmath377 ) .",
    "let the states of node be such that @xmath51 has @xmath378 links , and @xmath52 and @xmath379 have @xmath65 and @xmath380 ` holes ' , respectively .",
    "then one way around the loop is adding these two links followed by cutting them , which can be denoted as the sequence @xmath381and leaving the rest of @xmath43 unchanged .",
    "the associated product of the transition rates is , apart from an overall factor of @xmath382 , @xmath383now , the reversed loop can be denoted as @xmath384associated with the product @xmath385which is exactly equal to eqn .",
    "( [ product ] ) . from symmetry",
    ", we can expect the same results for loops involving two introverts and one extrovert ( i.e. , @xmath375 and @xmath386 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the kolmogorov criterion is satisfied and detailed balance is restored in this xie limit .",
