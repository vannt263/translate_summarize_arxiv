    "the planck scale plays a central role in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory .",
    "following heisenberg s principle , it was for a long time assumed that phase space structures for a quantum system associated with sub - planck scales ( @xmath3 ) do not matter . in a seminal paper  @xcite",
    ", zurek showed that this assumption is false .",
    "he demonstrated that in the phase space of non - local quantum superpositions ( or schrdinger cat states ) patchy structures on the sub - planck scale appear .",
    "moreover , he emphasized the physical importance of these sub - planck scale phenomena for quantum decoherence .",
    "it was known earlier that the generation of ` cat states ' is possible by the superposition of two minimum - uncertainty gaussians  @xcite . in the phase space description of such a superposition",
    ", interesting structures appear as a result of the interference between ` dead ' and ` alive ' states .",
    "this interference led to the idea of the superposition of four minimum - uncertainty gaussians as ` compass states ' , where more appealing fine structures appear as a result of the interference between north , south , east and west states  @xcite .",
    "these compass states appear under various names such as orthogonal - even coherent states or pair - cat coherent states .",
    "the compass state , as presented by zurek  @xcite , is constructed as a superposition of four coherent states .",
    "much of zurek s attention goes to the study of chessboard - type interference patterns on the sub - planck scale in the phase space description of this state .",
    "we also refer to other interesting works  @xcite , where different aspects of sub - planck structures were studied by a similar approach .",
    "note that in all these investigations , the sub - planck interference phenomena appear only via the appropriate superposition of _ coherent states_.    all these studies , however , lack information about possible scenarios for the transition from usual quantum mechanical structures to those with sub - planck lengths . in  @xcite ,",
    "zurek notes that the evolution of almost any system will lead into a cat ( compass ) state , i.e.  after sufficient time its behaviour will have coherence properties in phase space . then naturally the following question arises : is it possible to consider a scenario when the transition from usual quantum mechanical scales to a system with sub - planck structures will happen ?",
    "it is clear that in such a scenario , the proposed model should generalize both the ` initial ' quantum harmonic oscillator and the ` final ' compass ( or cat ) states .",
    "it means that the model should reduce to both the quantum harmonic oscillator and to a compass state at special limits of some parameter . considering that both the quantum harmonic oscillator and the compass state wavefunctions have analytical expressions , the proposed superposition should also be some analytic function . taking into account all these requirements , we shall propose in this letter a model based on the @xmath0-deformed quantum oscillator .",
    "quite surprisingly , the superposition of four _ stationary states _ of the @xmath0-oscillator exhibits , for certain values of the deformation parameter @xmath0 , the sub - planck interference patterns .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the first time that such patterns appear in the phase space description without the explicit use of coherent states .",
    "our letter is structured as follows : in section 2 , we provide basic information about the stationary states of the @xmath0-deformed oscillator , whose position wavefunctions are expressed by the rogers - szeg polynomials and propose the superposition that has the properties of the quantum harmonic oscillator when @xmath1 , and those of a compass state with the appearance of chessboard - type interference patterns when @xmath2 .",
    "further properties are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the stationary states of the @xmath0-deformed quantum harmonic oscillator in the @xmath4-representation are given in terms of rogers - szeg polynomials  @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is given in terms of the mass @xmath7 and frequency @xmath8 : @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is a normalization constant : @xmath11 @xmath12 is a _ deformation parameter _ related to a finite - difference method   for the step length of the finite - difference method .",
    "this should _ not _ be confused with the planck constant . referring to planck scales",
    ", we always use the reduced planck constant @xmath13 in this letter . ] with respect to @xmath4 , and @xmath14    furthermore , in  ( [ qho ] ) @xmath15 is the rogers - szeg polynomial of the following form  @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath0-shifted factorial defined by  @xcite @xmath18    it is known that in the limit @xmath19 , this wavefunction becomes the stationary state of the ordinary quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator in the @xmath4-representation  @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the usual hermite polynomial  @xcite :    @xmath22 } { \\frac{{\\left ( { - 1 } \\right)^k \\left ( { 2\\tilde x } \\right)^{n - 2k } } } { { k!\\left ( { n - k } \\right ) ! } } } , \\ ] ] and @xmath23 $ ] denotes the largest integer smaller than or equal to @xmath24 .",
    "the stationary states of the @xmath0-deformed quantum harmonic oscillator can also be determined in the @xmath25-representation .",
    "this yields an alternative model of the @xmath0-deformed oscillator .",
    "the normalized wavefunctions can be expressed through stieltjes - wigert polynomials  @xcite , or can be rewritten by means of the rogers - szeg polynomials : @xmath26    again , the limit @xmath19 yields the stationary states of the ordinary quantum harmonic oscillator .    in  @xcite it was observed , from the wigner function of the @xmath0-deformed oscillator , that the behaviour of the wavefunction @xmath27 when @xmath28 ( or @xmath29 ) is like a coherent state ( a gaussian peak displaced towards @xmath30 ",
    "i.e.  towards the west  in the @xmath31-plane ) .",
    "this observation leads us to the following superposition proposal : @xmath32 , \\label{compass - gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the west , east , south and north components @xmath33    the phase factors in  ( [ compass - gen ] ) are chosen ( according to  ( [ wave - ho ] ) ) in such a way that for the limit @xmath34 ( @xmath19 ) , all four components in  ( [ compass - gen ] ) become a normalized stationary state of the ordinary quantum oscillator .    the normalization constant is found from the following overlap of states  ( [ compass - gen ] ) : @xmath35 and it has the following form : @xmath36q^{nk }   \\right\\}^{-1/2 } .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is perhaps worth mentioning that for the four components of the wavefunction  ( [ compass - gen ] ) one has a hamiltonian operator , that can be expressed in terms of @xmath0-generalized creation and annihilation operators  @xcite .",
    "these are finite - difference operators and have the following form : @xmath37 they satisfy the @xmath0-heisenberg commutation relation @xmath38_q   = b^- b^+   - qb^+ b^- = 1 $ ] and in the limit @xmath39 , all these operators reduce to the well - known quantum harmonic oscillator creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the components in  ( [ compass - gen ] ) satisfy @xmath40_q \\psi_n(x)$ ] , where @xmath41_q$ ] is the basic number  @xcite : @xmath42_q = \\frac{{1 - q^n } } { { 1 - q}},\\ ] ] which gives the usual number @xmath43 under the following limit : @xmath44 note that the @xmath0-oscillator , as described here , is an ordinary quantum mechanical system ( i.e.  with the canonical commutation relations ) .",
    "the @xmath0-deformation originates only from the form of the hamiltonian operator  @xcite .",
    "the main result of the letter is that @xmath45 becomes the stationary state of an ordinary quantum oscillator when @xmath19 ( a fact already obtained from the earlier limit analysis ) , and that it becomes a compass state with sub - planck structures when @xmath28 . in order to investigate this last statement",
    ", let us compute and study the wigner distribution function for  ( [ compass - gen ] )  @xcite : @xmath46    this function can be computed explicitly and consists of @xmath47 components computed by the combination of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 wavefunctions  ( [ compass - gen ] ) : @xmath52    for the computation of these components , we refer to  @xcite , and just present the final expressions here : @xmath53",
    "@xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 where , @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the basic hypergeometric series of the following form  @xcite : @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "+   +     in figure  [ fig1 ] we show a density plot of the wigner function of the single photon state ( @xmath65 ) of  ( [ compass - gen ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we use @xmath66 .",
    "one can see that for values of @xmath12 close to @xmath67 ( this corresponds to the limit case @xmath68 ) the system under consideration coincides with the non - relativistic quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "the first signs of sub - planck structures can be seen in the second plot of figure  [ fig1 ] , which corresponds to the value @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) . by form and behaviour ,",
    "it can be considered as a scaled - up ` square ' from the chessboard - type pattern that appears in the compass state superposition .",
    "the next plot , which corresponds to the value @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) contains information about the possible evolution of the system to the compass state , i.e.  it can be considered as a primitive compass state . as can be seen from the next two plots , by increasing the value of @xmath12 we can observe the formation of four gaussian - like states directed to the north , south , east and west . as one can see from last plot , for values of @xmath73 ( @xmath2 )",
    "they become gaussians and their peaks are located at a distance equal to @xmath74 ( @xmath66 ) from the origin  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 5.3 ) ) .",
    "note that in figure  [ fig1 ] , since we work in the scale @xmath75 , the patchy interference structures that appear are obviously on a sub - planck scale .",
    "it can be verified that in the wigner function  ( [ wig-16 ] ) , the four terms @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are responsible for the four gaussian peaks directed to north , south , east and west respectively .",
    "the four sums of the form @xmath80 ( and similarly for @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) are responsible for the interference patterns in the four directions @xmath84 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "finally , the sum @xmath85 creates the chessboard - type pattern in the middle . analyzing this sum in more detail",
    ", one would observe that it is a real function of @xmath25 and @xmath4 consisting of the gaussian @xmath86 multiplied by complicated factors consisting of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions .",
    "both momentum and position appear together with the ratio @xmath87 as arguments of these trigonometric and hyperbolic functions . as long as @xmath88 , there are no signs of any sub - planck structures .",
    "these structures appear for sub - planck values of position and momentum when @xmath89 .",
    "as already mentioned , the superposition of the four coherent states is some generalization of so - called schrdinger cat states .",
    "therefore , in our case it is also possible to generate cat states from any pair of @xmath48 and @xmath49 or @xmath50 and @xmath51 states . also , the schrdinger equation corresponding to any component in  ( [ compass - gen ] ) is a finite - difference equation with @xmath12 the step of the finite difference",
    ". then one can take it equal to the compton wavelength @xmath90 , which will allow one to explore the relation of the interference terms with relativistic corrections  @xcite .",
