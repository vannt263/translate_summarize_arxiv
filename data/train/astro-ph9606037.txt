    "( 1986 ) were the first to note the remarkable similarity of the metal - line absorption systems in the spectra of tol  1037 - 2704 and tol  1038 - 2712 separated by 179 on the sky , corresponding to 4.3@xmath23  mpc for @xmath15  =  0.5 at @xmath17  @xmath2  2 .",

    "the spatial correlation function shows a marginally significant signal on scales of @xmath16  18  mpc .",

    "the fact that they are common to both tol  1037 - 2704 and tol  1038 - 2712 lines of sight could be due to chance coincidence ( cristiani et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "the importance of clarifying the presence of such a large structure at @xmath17  @xmath2  2 led us to observe tol  1037 - 2704 at a spectral resolution twice as high as previous observations , in order to be able to discuss the physical state of the gas in the  @xmath2  2.08 and  @xmath2  2.13 systems .",

    "the appearance of such complex may lead tol  1037 - 2704 to be classified as a bal qso ( weymann et al .",
    "this is the reason why a detailed discussion of the physical state of the absorbing gas is useful ( see section 3.1 ) .",
    "these are weak ( ( 1548,1550 )  =  0.07 , 0.04     and 0.06 , 0.04   ) c  iv systems with a single narrow ( @xmath3  @xmath2  10  km  s@xmath0 ) component .",

    "di96 identified the @xmath84193.4 feature as c  ii@xmath81334 at @xmath1  =  2.14233 on the basis of the presence of c  iv@xmath321548,1550 and si  iv@xmath81393 at the same redshift .",
    "however , in the di96 data , some of these features are blended with other lines . at our higher spectral resolution , we find that , if the c  ii@xmath81334 identification is correct , the redshift disagreement with c  iv is about 30  km  s@xmath0 that is larger than our resolution . moreover , at this redshift , we see neither si  iv@xmath81393 nor si  ii@xmath81260 which is as strong as c  ii@xmath81334 in neighbouring components . on the contrary , the identification as c  ii@xmath451335 gives nearly perfect redshift agreement with o  i , si  ii and fe  ii ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "we therefore believe that the identification as c  ii@xmath451335 is secure .",
    "this makes the detailed studying of this system of great importance for discussing the origin of the gas ( see section  3.2 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that a narrow and single n  v@xmath81238 line is detected at @xmath1  =  2.1358 .",
    "n  v@xmath81242 is at our detection limit .",
    "to ascertain the possible presence of a large concentration of gas possibly extended over 30@xmath12  mpc perpendicular to the line of sight and 80@xmath12  mpc along the line of sight ( di96 ) , we use our data to make a detailed analysis of the @xmath1  =  2.081 and 2.133 systems to differentiate between the ejection and the intervening hypotheses for the origin of these systems .",
    "it can be seen in fig .  3 that the c  iv lines do not go to the zero level .",
    "most of the components have apparent optical depth smaller than 0.7 .",
    "it is therefore expected that the apparent optical depth ratio @xmath46/@xmath47 is approximately equal to the oscillator strength ratio , @xmath48(@xmath81548)/@xmath48(@xmath81550 )  =  2 , if the lines are resolved .",
    "it is apparent that this is not true : @xmath46/@xmath47  @xmath16  1.5 .",
    "this suggests either that the absorbing cloud do not cover the continuum or that the cloud is made up of unresolved components .",
    "several arguments favor the later assumption .",
    "the velocity difference between the absorber and the quasar ( @xmath22  =  2.193 , sargent & steidel 1987 ) is about 10000  km  s@xmath0 , with no trace of similar absorption at smaller velocity difference ( see section 3.2 for discussion of the @xmath1  @xmath2  2.133 system ) . in order to partially cover the continuum source ,",
    "the clouds must be small and close to the quasar .",
    "however , the system is common to tol  1037 - 2704 and tol  1038 - 2712 ( di96 ) which are separated by 4@xmath12  mpc , and it is very unlikely that a sheet of very small clouds would extend from one qso to the other or that by chance material ejected by two independent qsos would have the same velocity difference ( sargent & steidel 1987 ) . finally , the system is not very highly ionized contrary to what is expected for gas close to the quasar ( see typical associated systems in petitjean et al .",
    "1994 ) .    assuming that the system is made up of narrow components , we have fitted the c  iv line profile .",
    "since we do not resolve individual components , the fit can not be unique .",
    "we assume therefore that individual components have doppler parameters in a given range @xmath49@xmath50 .",
    "we evaluate the mean doppler parameter by fitting the optical depths of both lines of the doublet ( see fig .  3 top panel ) and find @xmath3  @xmath2  8  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "we have checked that the best fit is obtained with @xmath49  =  4 and @xmath50  =  10  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "the global fit is given in fig .",
    "3 ( lower panel ) .",
    "we conclude from this that the gas temperature is smaller than 10@xmath51  k and probably smaller than 5@xmath2510@xmath52  k. using the positions and doppler parameters of the components derived from the fit , we then have fitted the si  iv , h  i and n  v wavelength ranges to derive column densities or upper limits .",
    "the conditions are fairly homogeneous in the complex and typical column densities are log  @xmath31  @xmath2  13.2 , 12.3 , 13 . , 13.7 and @xmath16  13 for h  i , si  iii , si  iv , c  iv and n  v respectively .",
    "the column density ratios are incompatible with ionization by a qso - like spectrum . indeed , from the large @xmath31(si",
    "iv)/@xmath31(c  iv ) ratio , the ionization parameter should be @xmath41  @xmath2  10@xmath42 ( see bergeron & stasiska 1986 ) whereas the large @xmath31(si  iv)/@xmath31(si  iii ) ratio indicates @xmath41  @xmath2  0.1 .",
    "one way to solve the contradiction is to consider that the gas is photo - ionized by a stellar spectrum with no photons above 45  ev .",
    "this suggests that this system originates in a h  ii region ( see also viegas & gruenwald 1991 )",
    ". it should be then highly ionized with si  iv / si  @xmath2  c  iv / c  @xmath2  1 . in this case since 10@xmath51 is a reasonable upper limit for h  ii / h  i , the abundances should be larger than 0.1  @xmath6 .",
    "alternatively if the temperature is @xmath53  @xmath2  10@xmath51  k and the gas collisionally ionized , the ionization correction ( see arnaud & rothenflug 1985 ) leads to carbon and silicon abundances of the order of 0.5 and 5 times the solar value respectively .",
    "although we can not firmly differentiate between both explanations , we can conclude that the gas is not photo - ionized by the qso and has fairly high metallicity for such redshift .      although the c  iv lines are particularly strong in this system , the line profiles are typical of a normal intervening system .",
    "in particular there is a strong h  i absorption and the low - ionization species are spread over a velocity range much smaller than c  iv .",
    "@xmath39  =  40 , 40 , 1200 , 1200 , 2200 and 3000   for o  i , fe  ii , si  ii , c  ii , si  iv and c  iv respectively .",
    "the c  iv profile is complex and heavily blended , so we concentrate our analysis on the o  i , c  ii@xmath7 , c  ii , si  ii and fe  ii lines ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the fit of the lines has been performed assuming that the redshift and @xmath3 values were the same for all species which is reasonable since the absorptions are expected to arise from the same phase .",
    "since we see two well detached components in fe  ii , we first tried to find a two - component model .",
    "this failed because the @xmath3 values mostly constrained by fe  ii were too large ( @xmath220  km  s@xmath0 ) for the si  ii@xmath81304 fit to be acceptable .",
    "the obvious solution was that the system is made up of a larger number of narrower components .",
    "we find a good overall fit for o  i , c  ii@xmath7 , c  ii and si  ii with four @xmath3  @xmath2  12  km  s@xmath0 components .",
    "the fe  ii profile imposes @xmath3  @xmath2  10  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this can be understood if the lines arise in a medium with turbulent motions characterised by @xmath3  @xmath2  8  km  s@xmath0 and @xmath53  @xmath2  50000  k. this values should be considered as upper limits .",
    "we find that the total column densities are log  @xmath31(o  i , c  ii@xmath7 , c  ii , si  ii and fe  ii )  =  14.9 , 14.0 , 14.8 , 14.6 , 14.6 respectively .",
    "if the c  ii column density can be considered as quite uncertain since it relies on a single strong line , this is not the case for other species which have at least one weak line .",
    "the h  i ly@xmath18 line is redshifted in a part of the spectrum with moderate s / n ratio .",
    "however from the lack of damped wings ( see fig .  1 and di96 )",
    ", we are confident that the total h  i column density is smaller than 4@xmath2510@xmath54  @xmath35 .",
    "we discuss the metallicities in the system compared to the logarithmic solar values : 3.4 , 3.2 , 4.6 and 4.5 for c , o , fe and si respectively .",
    "o  i and h  i being tied up by charge - exchange reaction , the @xmath31(o  i)/@xmath31(h  i ) column density ratio gives the oxygen abundance without need of any ionization correction .",
    "we thus conclude that the oxygen abundance is of the order of 0.03 solar .",
    "scaling photo - ionization models published in the literature ( see steidel 1990 , petitjean et al .",
    "1994 ) , we can derive relative abundances for other species .",
    "the above column densities indicate that the ionization parameter is smaller than 10@xmath42 . for log  @xmath31(h",
    "i )  =  19.5 , and metallicities @xmath4  =  0.01  @xmath6 , the models give log  @xmath31(o  i , c  ii , si  ii and fe  ii )  @xmath2  14.5 , 15.1 , 14.1 and 13.6 respectively .",
    "it can be seen that iron could be overabundant compared to oxygen by a factor of two to three .",
    "the conclusion that the [ fe / o ] ratio is close to solar for an absolute abundance of the order of a hundredth of solar is intriguing . indeed observations of metal deficient stars in the halo of our galaxy indicate that for [ fe / h ]  @xmath16  2 , [ o / fe ]  @xmath5  0.5 ( spite 1991 ) , consistent with predictions of chemical evolution models ( matteucci & padovani 1993 ) .",
    "the detection of the c  ii@xmath7@xmath81335 line shows that the fine structure upper level of the c  ii ground - state is populated .",
    "if this is due to collisions and if it is assumed that the gas is completely ionized as suggested by the moderate h  i column density ( h  i / h  @xmath16  1 ) , one can derive a value @xmath9  @xmath2  3  @xmath10 for the electronic density .",
    "we can combine the density and the ionization parameter derived from the ionization state of the gas to infer information about the ionizing flux .",
    "using @xmath55  =  @xmath56(@xmath57/@xmath58)@xmath59 with @xmath18  =  0.5 or 1.5 , we find that the flux at the lyman limit should be of the order of @xmath60  =  5@xmath2510@xmath61 or 1.5@xmath2510@xmath62  erg  @xmath35  s@xmath0  hz@xmath0  sr@xmath0 respectively .",
    "this is much higher than the uv background from qsos and early galaxies at this redshift ( miralda - escud & ostriker 1990 ) .",
    "some additional source must contribute the ionization .",
    "if this is the quasar , we derive that the distance to the quasar should be larger than 0.3@xmath12  mpc ( @xmath15  =  0.5 ) , using a typical luminosity of @xmath56  =  1.4@xmath2510@xmath63  erg  @xmath35  s@xmath0  hz@xmath0  sr@xmath0 ( sargent & steidel 1991 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that the system is not associated with the qso .",
    "we have shown in the previous sections that the gas lying on the line of sight to tol  1037 - 2704 is certainly not associated with the qso since the physical state is notably different from that of bal or associated systems ( e.g. wampler et al .",
    "1995 , petitjean et al . 1994 ) .",
    "most of the systems on the line of sight have column densities and ionization states typical of intervening systems with , when an estimate is possible , abundances of the order of 10@xmath6410@xmath0  @xmath6 .",
    "a detailed study of the o  i , c  ii@xmath7 , si  ii and fe  ii lines at @xmath1  @xmath2  2.1393 shows that the oxygen metallicity is of the order of 0.03  @xmath6 and [ fe / o ] is slightly larger than solar ; the ionization parameter and electronic density are of the order of @xmath41  @xmath2  10@xmath42 and @xmath9  @xmath2  3  @xmath10 .",
    "the distance to the qso is probably larger than 300@xmath12  kpc .",
    "the system at @xmath1  @xmath2  2.08 has a shallow and complex profile both on the line of sight to tol  1037 - 2704 and tol  1038 - 2712 .",
    "the fact that the strengths of the two lines of the c  iv and si  iv doublets are not in the oscillator strength ratios indicates that the complex is made up of narrow unresolved components .",
    "the temperature must be smaller than 10@xmath51  k. the abundances are larger than 0.1  @xmath6",
    ". if the gas is photo - ionized , the ionizing spectrum must be stellar .",
    "alternatively , the gas could be purely collisionally ionized . in this case",
    "however , silicon must be overabundant relative to carbon by a factor of ten .",
    "these results strengthen the conclusion by sargent & steidel ( 1987 ) and di96 that the material is part of an intervening supercluster .",
    "the latter authors have shown that the number of c  iv systems toward tol  1037 - 2704 and tol  1038 - 2712 is much in excess of what is expected .",
    "as we confirm seven of their probable systems toward tol  1037 - 2704 , the number of systems with @xmath37  @xmath5  0.15     is equal to 16 to be compared with 2 expected from poisson statistics .",
    "considering coincidences of absorption redshifts in four lines of sight in the same field , they find also that there is a marginally significant correlation on comoving scales of @xmath16  18  mpc .",
    "this altogether strongly suggests that we observe a supercluster which extends over 30@xmath2580@xmath12  mpc@xmath65 .",
    "deep imaging should be performed in this field to detect the luminous component of this large scale structure .",
