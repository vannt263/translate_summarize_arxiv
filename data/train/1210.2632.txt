    "quantum information processing shows maximum performance when it is run based on an ideal closed system .",
    "however , in reality any quantum system is an open system interacting with surrounding environment and has to be affected by _ decoherence _ , which can seriously degrade the information .",
    "therefore the theory of _ decoherence - free subspaces _ ( df subspaces ) or more generally _ decoherence - free subsystems _ ( df subsystems ) @xcite is very promising for realizing various key technologies in quantum information science , such as quantum computation @xcite , memory @xcite , communication @xcite , and metrology @xcite .",
    "it also should be mentioned that some experimental demonstrations have been reported @xcite .",
    "let us now review the basic idea of df ( or noiseless ) subsystems .",
    "quantum information processing is founded on the unitarity of the ideal closed dynamics of a system of interest @xcite .",
    "more precisely , the  state \" @xmath0 of a closed quantum system is driven by an hermitian operator ( hamiltonian ) @xmath1 and is subjected to the dynamics @xmath2",
    "=   -i(\\hat h \\hat\\rho_{\\rm cl } - \\hat\\rho_{\\rm cl } \\hat h)$ ] , which yields the solution @xmath3 ( a detailed description is given in appendix ) ; this unitary change of @xmath4 represents the quantum information processing under consideration , in which case it is often called the _ gate operation _ on @xmath4 .",
    "however , in reality any quantum system interacts with environment and does not obey a unitary dynamics .",
    "especially when the interaction is instantaneous and a markovian approximation can be taken , the system s state evolves in time with the following _ master equation _ : @xmath5         + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (             \\hat l_i \\hat\\rho \\hat l_i^ *              -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_i^ * \\hat",
    "l_i \\hat\\rho               -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat\\rho \\hat l_i^ * \\hat l_i \\big).\\ ] ] the operator @xmath6 represents the coupling between the system and the @xmath7-th environment field ; this second term represents the decoherence . due to this",
    ", the time - evolution of @xmath8 is not unitary , implying that in general coherent manipulation or preservation of an arbitrary state of an open system is impossible .",
    "nevertheless , it is known in the _ finite dimensional _ case that we can have a chance to protect a specific part of the state against the environment .",
    "that is , if the system matrices @xmath1 and @xmath9 satisfy specific algebraic conditions and an appropriate initial state @xmath10 is prepared , then in certain basis vectors the system state has a block diagonal form @xmath11 for all @xmath12 , with @xmath13 denoting the kronecker product ; @xmath14 is the state of the df subsystem , which obeys a unitary time evolution , while the decohered ( d ) component @xmath15 is still subjected to a non - unitary dynamics .",
    "that is , the dynamics of these states are respectively given by @xmath16 ,   \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-2em } \\label{d dynamics in introduction }      \\frac{d\\hat \\rho_{\\rm d}}{dt }       = - i[\\hat h ' , \\hat\\rho_{\\rm d } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{0em }      \\mbox { }       + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (         \\hat l'_i \\hat\\rho_{\\rm d } \\hat l_i'\\mbox{}^ *          -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_i'\\mbox{}^ * \\hat l'_i \\hat\\rho_{\\rm d }           -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat\\rho_{\\rm d } \\hat l_i'\\mbox{}^ * \\hat l'_i \\big ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) , the space of @xmath19 is called the df subspace .",
    "note that the complement @xmath20 is also decohered and its dynamics is governed by a master equation .",
    "equation   means that , by appropriately devising the reduced hamiltonian @xmath21 , we can carry out a desirable unitary gate operation .",
    "now we come up with the following question ; is it possible to construct a df subsystem in the _ infinite dimensional _ case ?",
    "this question is equivalent to asking the applicability of the above theory for discrete variable ( dv ) systems to continuous variable ( cv ) systems @xcite . indeed , despite the recent rapid progress of quantum information science with infinite - dimensional / cv systems , there has not been developed a general theory of df subsystems ; it was only shown in @xcite that the infinite dimensional df subsystems can be characterized in terms of operator algebras , which is though hard to use for engineering purpose .",
    "the problem becomes relatively easy if we focus on the case where there is no decohered subspace component , i.e. the case where the decomposition @xmath22 is possible .",
    "actually in this case some infinite dimensional systems having a df subsystem are known , in which case the df component is often called the _ dark mode _ ; the df mode is utilized for state generation and preservation @xcite , cooling of a mechanical oscillator @xcite , and state transfer @xcite .",
    "however there is no general theory unifying the methods taken in these examples .",
    "particularly what is lacking is the general procedure for constructing a df subsystem , which has actually been found in the finite dimensional case @xcite .",
    "this paper provides a basic framework dealing with a general _ linear quantum system _ containing a df subsystem , when especially there is no decohered subspace component .",
    "a linear system is an infinite dimensional open system that describes the dynamics of , for instance , optical modes of a light field @xcite , position of an opto - mechanical oscillator @xcite , vibration mode of a trapped particle @xcite , collective spin component of a large atomic ensemble @xcite , or more generally canonical conjugate pairs of a harmonic oscillator network @xcite , which all serve as quantum information devices .",
    "the key ideas are twofold .",
    "the first main idea is that we focus on the dynamics of _ finite _ number of physical quantities ( called  observables \" in physics ) that completely characterize the system of interest , rather than the state that must be defined on the whole infinite dimensional space .",
    "this means that we represent the system in the _ heisenberg picture _ , rather than the schrdinger picture describing the dynamics of a state .",
    "then , the system dynamics is not described by the master equation , but by a _",
    "quantum stochastic differential equation ( qsde ) _",
    "the qsde explicitly represents the system - environment coupling in a form that the equation contains the terms of environmental input and output fields . together with the fact that we are now dealing with the finite number of observables , this critical feature of the qsde further leads us to have the second main idea .",
    "we are now able to naturally define a df observable as follows ; i.e. , it is an observable such that its dynamics is not affected by the environmental input field and the behavior of that observable does not appear in the output field .",
    "actually it will be proven in this paper that this definition is equivalent to the original one , for the finite dimensional case .",
    "the significant point of this definition is that a df subsystem is now clearly characterized in terms of the notions of _ controllability _ and _ observability _ , which are well developed in control theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in particular , in the linear case , such controllability and observability properties can be straightforwardly captured by simple matrix algebras that only require us to compute the rank of certain matrices . as a result , based on the qsde representation of a given linear open quantum system ,",
    "we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for that system to have a df subsystem , which further leads to an explicit procedure for constructing the df subsystem .",
    "this result will be given in section  iii .",
    "once a df subsystem is constructed , then we should be interested in the _ stability _ of the dynamics . in the current context , this is the property that autonomously erases the correlation between the df and the d parts , and it has been extensively investigated for finite dimensional systems @xcite . in section",
    "iv , particularly in the case of gaussian systems @xcite , a simple if and only if criterion that guarantees the stability of a df subsystem will be provided .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is devoted to the study of some concrete examples of a df linear subsystem , which is divided into two topics as follows .    *",
    "( i ) * ( section v ) the first topic deals with coherent manipulation and preservation of a state of a df subsystem .",
    "more specifically , it is demonstrated that , in a specific two - mode linear system having a one - mode df component , arbitrary linear unitary gate operation and state preservation are possible under relatively mild assumptions .",
    "also , for the same system , it will be shown that preserving a state of the df subsystem is equivalent to preserving a certain _ entangled state _ among the whole two - mode system .",
    "in addition , the stability property is examined , showing its importance in realizing robust state manipulation and preservation with the df subsystem .    *",
    "( ii ) * ( section vi ) the second is about how to engineer a df subsystem for a given open linear system .",
    "we actually find in two specific examples that , by appropriately devising an auxiliary system coupled to the original one , it is possible to construct a physically meaningful df subsystem .",
    "therefore , in addition to the practical merit that a df subsystem can be used for coherent quantum information processing , a df subsystem is useful in the sense that it simulates an ideal closed quantum system even in a realistic open environment .",
    "we use the following notations : for a matrix @xmath23 , the symbols @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 represent its hermitian conjugate , transpose , and elementwise complex conjugate of @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively . for a matrix of operators , @xmath31 , we use the same notation , in which case @xmath32 denotes the adjoint to @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 denotes the @xmath35 identity matrix . @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "denote the real and imaginary parts , respectively .",
    "@xmath38 is a zero matrix with appropriate dimension .",
    "@xmath13 is the tensor product , which is the kronecker product in the finite dimensional case . @xmath39 and @xmath40 denote the kernel and the range of a matrix @xmath27 , respectively . throughout the paper",
    ", we set @xmath41 .",
    "some fundamentals of quantum mechanics , e.g. , states and observables , are given in appendix .",
    "let us consider an open system interacting with some environment fields , which are assumed to be independent vacuum fields for simplicity .",
    "the time - evolution of an observable of this system is described by a qsde , as shown below . for a comprehensive introduction to the theory of quantum stochastic calculus",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath42 be the annihilation operator of the @xmath7-th vacuum field and assume that @xmath42 instantaneously interacts with the system , which means that it satisfies the _ canonical commutation relation _",
    "( ccr ) @xmath43=\\delta_{ij}\\delta(t - s)$ ] .",
    "this relation reminds us the classical white noise ; actually the field annihilation process @xmath44 , which is the quantum version to the classical wiener process , satisfies the following _ quantum ito rule _ ( in the vacuum field ) @xcite : @xmath45 where the adjoint operator @xmath46 represents the field creation process . the system - field interaction in the time interval @xmath47",
    "is described by the hamiltonian @xmath48 , where @xmath6 is a system operator representing the coupling with the @xmath7-th vacuum field .",
    "a system observable @xmath49 evolves in the heisenberg picture to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the unitary operator from time @xmath52 to @xmath53 , which is constructed from the relation @xmath54 with @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "then , using the above quantum ito rule we can derive the qsde of @xmath56 : @xmath57   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1em }      \\mbox { }         + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (            \\hat l_i^*(t ) \\hat x(t ) \\hat l_i(t )            -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_i^*(t ) \\hat l_i(t ) \\hat x(t ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{8.7em }      \\mbox { }             -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat x(t ) \\hat l_i^*(t ) \\hat l_i(t ) \\big ) \\big)dt \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-1em }      \\mbox { }        + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (             [ \\hat x(t ) ,",

    "\\hat l_i^*(t)]d\\hat a_i(t ) \\big ) . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have added a system hamiltonian @xmath1 and defined @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the master equation of the system s unconditional state , @xmath60 , is obtained through the time evolution of the mean value of @xmath56 and the relation @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "the change of the field operator is also obtained ; the output field @xmath62 after the interaction satisfies @xmath63      in this paper , we consider a system composed of @xmath64 subsystems .",
    "the variable of each subsystem is called the _ mode _ ; particularly in our case the @xmath7-th mode is specified by the canonical conjugate pairs @xmath65 satisfying the ccr @xmath66=i \\delta _ { ij}$ ] . note that both @xmath67 and @xmath68 are infinite dimensional operators , hence the system is of infinite dimensional .",
    "let us here define the vector of operators @xmath69 .",
    "then the ccrs @xmath66=i \\delta _ { ij}$ ] are summarized as @xmath70 where @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is a @xmath73 block diagonal matrix . ) we are interested in a system whose hamiltonian and coupling operator are respectively given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "also let us define the canonical conjugate pairs of the noise process : @xmath77 and collect them into a single vector of operators as @xmath78 .",
    "then , from the qsde , the vector of system variables @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 , satisfies the following linear equation : @xmath82 the coefficient matrices are given by @xmath83 this specific structure of the system matrices is due to the unitary evolution of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , which is indeed necessary to satisfy the ccr @xmath86=i \\delta _ { ij}$ ] for all @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , corresponding to the canonical conjugate representation of the input field , let us define the output process as @xmath87 and collect them as @xmath88 .",
    "then , from we have @xmath89 to denote the system variable , in what follows we often omit the time index @xmath53 and simply use @xmath90 ; to avoid confusion , the initial value is explicitly written as @xmath91 .    here",
    "we remark that the linearly transformed variable @xmath92 must satisfy the ccr , which implies that @xmath93 .",
    "consequently , in the quantum case , the similarity transformation @xmath94 must be _ symplectic _ , meaning that it satisfies @xmath95 note further that , in the linear case , the time evolution is also a symplectic transformation , because we can find a symplectic matrix @xmath96 satisfying @xmath97 .",
    "now let @xmath98 be the mean vector , where the mean operation @xmath99 is taken elementwise .",
    "the covariance matrix is defined by @xmath100 note that the uncertainty relation @xmath101 holds .",
    "then for the linear system , the time - evolutions of @xmath98 and @xmath102 are respectively given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "a quantum gaussian state can be characterized by only the mean vector @xmath98 and the covariance matrix @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "more specifically , its wigner function is identical to the gaussian probabilistic distribution with mean @xmath98 and covariance @xmath102 .",
    "a notable property of a linear system is that it preserves the gaussianity of the state ; that is , if the initial state of the system is gaussian , then , for all later time @xmath53 the state is gaussian with mean @xmath105 and covariance @xmath106 , whose time evolutions are given by the linear differential equations .",
    "a unique steady state of this gaussian system exists only when @xmath27 is a _ hurwitz _ matrix , i.e. , all the eigenvalues of @xmath27 have negative real parts .",
    "if it exists , the mean vector is @xmath107 , and the covariance matrix @xmath108 is given by the unique solution to the algebraic lyapunov equation @xmath109 .",
    "note that several non - gaussian states can be generated in a linear quantum system @xcite .",
    "here we review the notions of controllability and observability , which play the fundamental roles in characterizing various important properties of a system , such as stabilizability of the system via control input or capability of constructing an estimator that continuously monitors the system variables .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for full description of those theories .",
    "let us consider the following general linear system : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the system variable of dimension @xmath64 , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are an input and an output with certain dimensions , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath112 represents any input such as a disturbing noise and a tunable control signal .",

    "this equation shows that @xmath119 is not affected by @xmath112 , hence it is called _ uncontrollable _ with respect to ( w.r.t . ) @xmath112 . of course , if @xmath121 , or equivalently if @xmath122 is of full rank , then all the elements of @xmath111 is affected by @xmath112 and in this case the system is called controllable . next ,",
    "let us define the _ observability matrix _ @xmath123 and assume that @xmath124 . then , there exists a linear coordinate transformation that transforms to the system of the following form : @xmath125 where @xmath126 is of dimension @xmath127 .",

    "@xmath113 . note here that the term ",

    "in this section , based on the qsde representation of the system , we show the if and only if condition for a general linear quantum system to have a df subsystem , particularly in the case where there is no decohered subspace component .",
    "moreover , we will see that this condition leads to a concrete procedure for constructing the df subsystem .    here",
    "we remark that in @xcite the heisenberg picture is taken to investigate the quantum error correction , in the general finite dimensional case .",
    "this approach differs from ours in that the authors have examined the _",
    "mean _ dynamics of the system observables with its environment fields traced out ( averaged ) ; that is , unlike the qsde , the time - evolution equation does not contain the input and output terms , so the notions of controllability and observability are not applicable .      in this subsection",
    ", we describe a finite dimensional open system having a df subsystem , in the heisenberg picture .",
    "as mentioned in section  i , if the system contains a df subsystem , then its state , which is subjected to the master equation , is represented in a specific basis as @xmath11 with @xmath19 governed by the unitary dynamics .",
    "ticozzi and viola @xcite gave an explicit iff condition for the system to have a df subsystem ; in particular when there is no decohered subspace , the condition is that the system matrices are of the following form : @xmath128 actually , by substituting these matrices with initial state @xmath129 for the master equation , we obtain and .",
    "let us now change the picture to the heisenberg s one and look at the dynamics of an open system , the qsde .",
    "now we assume that the system matrices are given by ; then the system observables @xmath130 and @xmath131 satisfy the following dynamical equations : @xmath132dt ,   \\\\ & & \\hspace*{-2em } \\label{qsde - d }      d\\hat x_{\\rm d}=\\big ( i[\\hat h_{\\rm d } , \\hat x_{\\rm d } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{1em }      \\mbox { }       + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (        \\hat l_{{\\rm d},i}^ * \\hat x_{\\rm d } \\hat l_{{\\rm d},i }       -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_{{\\rm d},i}^ * \\hat l_{{\\rm d},i } \\hat x_{\\rm d } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{9.4em }      \\mbox { }       -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat x_{\\rm d } \\hat l_{{\\rm d},i}^ * \\hat l_{{\\rm d},i }          \\big ) \\big)dt \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace*{1em }      \\mbox { }        + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\big (             [ \\hat x_{\\rm d } , \\hat l_{{\\rm",

    "thus , the above equations imply that @xmath136 is completely isolated from the environment . in other words",
    ", @xmath136 is not affected by the input field @xmath137 , and the output field @xmath138 does not contain any information about that observable for all @xmath7 . in terms of control theory , therefore , an observable that is decoherence free is uncontrollable w.r.t . @xmath137 and unobservable w.r.t .",
    "@xmath139 for all @xmath7 .      in the above subsection",
    "we have seen that a df observable is uncontrollable and unobservable . in the finite dimensional case , this is indeed true for _ any _ df observable , because is necessary and sufficient .",
    "this characterization is reasonable from both physics and engineering viewpoints , and thus , it may be taken as a definition for a system to have a df subsystem even in the infinite dimensional case . in particular , for the linear quantum system and , we pose the following formal statement :    [ def of df mode ] for the linear quantum system and , suppose that ( i ) there exists a subsystem that is uncontrollable w.r.t . @xmath140 and unobservable w.r.t .",
    "@xmath141 , and further , ( ii ) its variable satisfies the ccr .",
    "then , that subsystem is called the df subsystem , and its variable @xmath142 is called the df mode .    the requirement for @xmath142 to satisfy the ccr property stems from the fact that , in cv quantum information processing , any gate operation acts on the pairs of canonical conjugate observables , and this discerns our problem from a simple one where we are interested in a merely uncontrollable and unobservable subsystem .",
    "a different view of this requirement is that it corresponds to the _ physical realizability _",
    "condition @xcite of the df subsystem ; indeed , if the subsystem is completely isolated , it must be a physical system .",

    "the purpose here is to fully characterize the linear system having a df subsystem . as in the classical case , the following controllability matrix @xmath122 and the observability matrix @xmath143 will play a key role in deriving such a characterization",
    "; @xmath144 the following lemma will be useful :    [ df lemma ] @xmath145    suppose @xmath146 .",

    "this condition yields @xmath150 for all @xmath151 , hence @xmath152 . the reverse direction is readily obtained .",
    "this strong relationship between the controllability and observability properties follows from the specific structure of the system matrices mentioned in section ii - b .",
    "interestingly , this relationship can be connected to the ccr as follows .",
    "let us define two observables @xmath153 and @xmath154 with @xmath155 a normalized vector in @xmath156 .",

    "thus , in the linear case , an uncontrollable physical quantity and an unobservable physical quantity are in the relationship of canonical conjugation .",
    "the following theorem is our first main result :    [ df mode theorem ] the linear system and has a df subsystem if and only if @xmath158 then there always exists a matrix @xmath159 satisfying @xmath160 and @xmath161 , and then the df mode is given by @xmath162 .",

    "therefore , the transformation @xmath92 yields the explicit form of the dynamics of the df and d modes as follows ; noting @xmath191 and @xmath192 , we find that is transformed to @xmath193 where the relation @xmath194 is used . also , @xmath195 follows from the condition @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) , which implies that there exists a matrix @xmath198 satisfying @xmath199 .",
    "moreover , the output equation is represented as @xmath200 from and , @xmath142 is apparently a df mode that is completely isolated from the environmental noise fields . in particular",
    ", the equation @xmath201 means that the df mode obeys the unitary time evolution governed by the hamiltonian @xmath202 that is , the unitary gate operation @xmath203 can be carried out coherently on the df mode @xmath142 .",
    "lastly in this section , we consider the following practical question ; given a system - environment interaction such that there exists a df subsystem , what kind of system hamiltonian is allowed in order for the df subsystem to be unchanged ? more precisely , if the condition is satisfied for a given @xmath204 and @xmath205 , how can we construct a non - zero matrix @xmath206 such that still holds ? here a simple characterization of such @xmath206 is given :    [ df mode prop ] suppose that , for a given @xmath204 , there exists a non - zero matrix @xmath159 satisfying @xmath207 and @xmath177 .",
    "then , if @xmath208 is invariant under a linear transformation @xmath206 , the system specified by this @xmath206 and the same @xmath204 has a df subsystem with mode @xmath209 .",
    "the invariance condition means that there exists a matrix @xmath210 satisfying @xmath211 , which is equivalent to @xmath212 due to the assumption on @xmath159 ; thus @xmath213 holds .",
    "then , since @xmath194 , we have @xmath214 for all @xmath151 .",
    "again from the relation @xmath177 , this implies @xmath215 as well .",
    "consequently , it follows from a similar calculation shown in the proof of lemma  [ df lemma ] that @xmath216 is satisfied ; this means the system has a df subsystem with df mode @xmath209 .",
    "this proposition further leads to a convenient result in a particular case :    [ df mode corollary ] in addition to the assumptions made in proposition [ df mode prop ] , suppose @xmath217 .",
    "then , the system specified by @xmath206 and the same @xmath204 has a df subsystem with mode @xmath209 , if and only if @xmath218 .    as proven above",
    ", @xmath209 is a df mode if and only if @xmath214 holds for all @xmath151 .",
    "then , because of @xmath219 , it is equivalent to @xmath220",
    ". hence , we further equivalently have @xmath221 and thus @xmath218 .",
    "in this section , we assume that the system s initial state is gaussian , hence the state is always gaussian and is characterized by only the mean vector and the covariance matrix , as explained in section  [ preliminary : gaussian states ] . within this framework ,",
    "we here study a stability property of the general linear df subsystem .",
    "note that in the finite dimensional case some useful results guaranteeing similar stability properties of a df subsystem have been obtained in @xcite .    in order to coherently manipulate a quantum state of the df subsystem , i.e. @xmath19",
    ", it has to be separated from that of the d subsystem with mode @xmath181 ; actually , if @xmath142 is quantally correlated ( i.e. , entangled ) with @xmath181 , this means that @xmath19 can be affected from the environment .",
    "this requirement for separability of the df and the d states is , in gaussian case , implied by the condition that the covariance matrix @xmath102 of the whole system is expressed as @xmath222 , where @xmath223 and @xmath224 correspond to the covariance matrices of @xmath142 and @xmath181 , respectively .",

    "when partitioning the matrix variable @xmath102 as @xmath239 , the dynamics of @xmath240 is given by @xmath241 we now take a vector form of this matrix differential equation .",
    "for this purpose , let @xmath174 be a collection of the row vectors of @xmath240 , which is a real @xmath242-dimensional row vector .",

    "let us consider the eigen - equation @xmath250 with @xmath251 the eigenvector and @xmath252 the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "from this we have @xmath253 , which immediately leads to @xmath254 . if @xmath237 , this can be further expressed as @xmath255 , implying @xmath256 or @xmath257 ; in both cases we have @xmath258=0 $ ] .",
    "we remark that the specific assumption @xmath259 is significant from the viewpoint of state manipulation ; recall that the unitary gate operation with a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath260 is given by @xmath261 . then , it was shown in @xcite that , if @xmath262 , for any @xmath263 and @xmath264 there always exists @xmath265 such that @xmath266 with @xmath267 an appropriate operator norm .",
    "this result means that a unitary operation requiring propagation with negative time can be always realized by a physically realizable unitary operation with positive time ; this condition is indeed necessary to implement a desirable unitary gate operation via a sequence of unitaries generated from a set of available hamiltonians .",
    "coherent state manipulation and preservation are certainly primary applications of a df subsystem , as demonstrated extensively in the finite dimensional case .",
    "this section presents two simple examples to show how a df mode can be used in order to achieve these goals in an infinite dimensional linear quantum system .",

    "let us consider a toy system composed of two  particles \" trapped in a two - sided optical cavity depicted in fig .",
    "[ dfmodeexample ] .",
    "the coupling operator between the particles and the outer environment field is @xmath268 , where @xmath269 ; @xmath67 and @xmath68 represent the position and momentum operators of the @xmath7-th particle .",
    "this dissipation effect described by @xmath270 stems from the coupling of the particles to the single - mode cavity field that immediately decays and can be adiabatically eliminated @xcite ; the parameter @xmath271 represents the decay rate of this dissipation . for more realistic setups ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the system dynamics and the output equation are now given by @xmath272 where @xmath273    we begin with the assumption that the system does not have its own hamiltonian ( i.e. , @xmath274 ) and then try to find a df subsystem . in this case , we have @xmath275 therefore , @xmath276 and @xmath277 span the kernels of both of these matrices ; i.e. , @xmath278 .",
    "hence , from theorem [ df mode theorem ] the system has a df subsystem . in particular , the procedure shown in the proof of theorem  [ df mode theorem ] yields @xmath279 , thus the df mode is given by @xmath280    here let us discuss adding a nonzero matrix @xmath206 that does not change the above - obtained df subsystem .",
    "now @xmath281 , hence from corollary  [ df mode corollary ] , @xmath206 is required to satisfy @xmath218 .",
    "then it is immediate to see that @xmath206 has to be of the form @xmath282 where @xmath283 and @xmath284 are both real @xmath285 symmetric matrices .",
    "therefore , the df subsystem is driven by the hamiltonian   with @xmath286 .",
    "this means that , if each particle is governed by the hamiltonian specified by @xmath283 and this hamiltonian can be arbitrarily chosen , we can perform arbitrary linear gate operation on the state of @xmath142 .",
    "also , when @xmath287 , we can preserve any state of the df subsystem .",
    "next , to evaluate the stability of the df subsystem , let us explicitly construct the dynamics of both @xmath142 and @xmath181 , according to the procedure shown above . to obtain the matrix @xmath288 , we chose @xmath289 as a basis vector orthogonal to @xmath171 and @xmath290 .",
    "then @xmath291 is orthogonal to @xmath292 , and @xmath182 , implying @xmath293 .",

    "now assume that the state is gaussian .",
    "then , by taking large @xmath271 so that the condition of theorem  [ df stability ] is satisfied , we can guarantee the stability of the df subsystem .",
    "that is , the off - diagonal block matrix of the covariance matrix @xmath298 converges to zero as @xmath248 , thus in the long time limit the states of df and d modes are always separated .",
    "hence , with this gaussian system , arbitrary linear gate operation and state preservation can be carried out in a robust manner , under relatively mild assumptions .",
    "lastly , under the assumption that the state is gaussian and the condition @xmath287 , let us examine the state preserved in the whole system .",
    "in fact , in this case @xmath142 does not change in time , and hence the whole state of @xmath90 is preserved if @xmath181 is in a steady state .",
    "this condition is achieved by again taking large @xmath271 so that the coefficient matrix of the drift term of @xmath181 is hurwitz ; in this case , @xmath181 has a steady gaussian state with covariance matrix @xmath299 . as a result , the covariance matrix of the whole state of @xmath297 is @xmath300 , where here the initial time is reset to @xmath301 .",
    "the covariance matrix of @xmath90 is then given by @xmath302 if the initial state of @xmath142 can be set to a _ squeezed state _",
    "@xcite with covariance matrix @xmath303 , then @xmath230 takes the form @xmath304 as mentioned above , this state does not change in time .",
    "thus the state preserved is a pure entangled gaussian state called the _ two - mode squeezed state _",
    "@xcite ; actually , the purity for this state is @xmath305 , and the logarithmic negativity @xcite , which is a convenient measure for entanglement , is @xmath306 .",
    "this result was found in a specific setup @xcite , but here we have the following general statement ; in general , preservation of a nontrivial state of a df subsystem can lead to that of an entangled state of the whole system , if the stability of the df mode is guaranteed .",
    "in other words , a system having a stable df mode can be utilized for preserving an entangled state among the whole system , as well as a state of the df subsystem .",
    "the second example shown here deals with the two particles trapped in an optical cavity as before , but with different coupling @xmath307 , where again @xmath67 is the position operator of the @xmath7-th particle .",
    "this coupling realizes a continuous - time measurement of @xmath308 ; see e.g. @xcite for how to actually construct this kind of position monitoring scheme .",
    "now @xmath309 , hence , when @xmath274 , we have @xmath310 and thus @xmath311 the intersection of these two spaces is the same as that obtained in the previous example , thus we have the same coordinate transformation matrix .",

    "note that @xmath315 is not affected by the noisy environment while it appears in the output equation .",
    "this means that we can extract information about @xmath316 without disturbing it ; that is , @xmath316 is a _ quantum non - demolition _ ( qnd ) observable ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "let us now discuss the state manipulation and preservation with this system . as in the previous example",
    ", if two particles have the same and arbitrary hamiltonian specified by @xmath283 , this means that any linear gate operation on the df mode is possible .",
    "however , this system does not satisfy the condition of theorem  [ df stability ] , implying that the system does not have capability of decoupling the df and the d modes once they become correlated . in this sense ,",
    "the state manipulation with this df mode is not robust .",
    "next , to see if the system can preserve a state of the whole system , let us again set the initial state to the gaussian state with covariance matrix .",
    "a notable difference from the previous case is that now the d mode does not have a steady state , and eventually the whole state is a time - varying one with covariance matrix @xmath317 the purity of this gaussian state",
    "is @xmath318 and thus converges to zero as @xmath248 .",
    "that is , any useful state does not remain alive in the long time limit . as a result , due to the lack of the stability property",

    "this section deals with the topic of how to _ engineer _ a df subsystem , when a certain linear open system is given to us .",
    "more precisely , the problem is not how to find a df component in that system , but rather how to synthesize an auxiliary system so that the extended system has a desirable df mode .",
    "this engineering problem is important for purely exploring the nature of a system of interest , as well as for the application to quantum information science such as coherent state manipulation and preservation as discussed in the previous section .",

    "although we can fabricate this auxiliary system using only some optical devices , a natural situation is that another opto - mechanical oscillator with the same mass and resonant frequency serves as the auxiliary system .",
    "the resulting extended system is shown in fig .",

    "this equation shows that the relative coordinate of the oscillators is decoupled from the cavity field ; actually , if the radiation pressure force pushes the oscillators along the same direction , then their relative coordinate is independent to the optical path length of the cavity , so it should be decoherence free . note that , of course , this can happen only when the two oscillators are identical .",
    "a notable point is that the df subsystem is governed by the same hamiltonian as that of the original oscillator .",
