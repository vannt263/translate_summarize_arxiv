    "we have developed a time - resolved neutron imaging detector with sub - mm spatial and @xmath0s - order time resolutions , excellent gamma rejection , and high - rate capability  @xcite .",
    "this neutron imaging detector is intended for use at high - intensity , pulsed neutron sources , where radiographic imaging is combined with neutron energy measured via time - of - flight ( tof ) .",
    "our detector consists of a time - projection - chamber ( tpc ) with an active volume of @xmath3  @xmath4 contained within an aluminum pressure vessel .",
    "the tpc is read out by a @xmath0pic ( micro - pixel chamber ) micro - pattern gaseous detector with a 400-@xmath0 m pitch , incorporating orthogonal anode and cathode strips for a 2-dimensional readout  @xcite . using an ar - c@xmath5h@xmath6-@xmath7he ( 63:7:30 ) gas mixture at 2 atm ,",
    "neutrons are detected via absorption on @xmath7he with 18% efficiency at a neutron energy of 25.3  mev .",
    "a peak efficiency of up to 65% at 0.35  mev is possible with the simple modifications to the pressure vessel described in ref .",
    "the detector is coupled with a fast , fpga ( field programmable gate array)-based data acquisition system  @xcite that records both the energy deposition ( via time - over - threshold ) and 3-dimensional tracking information ( 2-dimensional position plus time ) for each neutron event .",
    "our neutron imaging detector is well suited to such tof - based techniques as neutron resonance absorption spectroscopy ( nras ) for measuring nuclide composition , density , and temperature  @xcite , and bragg - edge transmission for studying crystal structure ( e.g. , lattice spacing , grain size and orientation , etc . ) and residual strain  @xcite .",
    "such an area detector enables detailed , non - destructive 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional ( using computed tomography ) study of internal material properties at the sub - mm level with short measurement times .    as reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , our detector achieved a spatial resolution of @xmath8  @xmath0 m ( @xmath9 ) , a time resolution as low as 0.6  @xmath0s , and an effective gamma sensitivity of 10@xmath10 or less . in the present paper , we introduce an analysis method that more fully leverages the time - over - threshold information to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the neutron position reconstruction .",
    "we then present a study of the uniformity and gain dependence of the spatial resolution , discuss the results in relation to other neutron imaging detectors , and end with a simple demonstration of radiographic and resonance imaging .",
    "the absorption of low energy neutrons on @xmath7he produces a proton - triton pair with total kinetic energy of @xmath11764  kev and a combined track length of about 8  mm in the 2-atm gas of our detector . as the range of",
    "the proton is about three times that of the heavier triton , the separation of the two particles is essential for an accurate determination of the neutron interaction position .",
    "the separation is complicated , however , by the fact that , due to the low incident neutron energies typical in radiography , the proton and triton emerge essentially back - to - back .",
    "it is thus necessary to utilize additional information , in the form of the energy deposition at each strip ( estimated via time - over - threshold ) , to perform the separation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the shape of the energy deposition , like that illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] , was used to determine the proton direction , and a correction to the neutron position was then made relative to the mid - point of the track .",
    "this simple algorithm achieved a spatial resolution of @xmath8  @xmath0 m ( @xmath9 ) , representing nearly a factor of three improvement over that possible in the absence of the time - over - threshold ( tot ) information ( i.e. , when taking the neutron position as the mid - point of the proton - triton track ) .",
    "however , the algorithm suffered from poor reconstruction efficiency , since it was only applicable when the proton and triton were clearly visible in both the anode and cathode tot distributions .",
    "this requirement severely restricted the usable range of track angles , resulting in the rejection of about 65% of detected neutron events .",
    "time - over - threshold ( tot ) for proton - triton tracks .",
    "this representative tot distribution ( solid line ) was determined by averaging several thousand neutron events with a particular proton - triton track angle .",
    "the simulation result for the same track angle is overlaid ( dashed line ) .",
    "arrows indicate the direction of the proton and triton . ]    in the present paper , we introduce a more accurate method for finding the neutron position that not only produced a better spatial resolution but allowed us to include the entire range of track angles . here , the neutron position was found by fitting the measured tot distributions with the expected distributions ( referred to as _ templates _ ) determined using a simulation of our detector system .",
    "the simulation was based on the geant4 software toolkit  @xcite as described in ref .",
    "the simulation result for a particular proton - triton track angle is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] ( dashed line ) along with the tot distribution for real neutrons ( solid line ) at the same angle .",
    "the slight disagreement between the distributions is due to simplifications and uncertainties in the simulated response of the data acquisition hardware , coupled with the uncertainty in the neutron interaction position in the real data .",
    "the fitting , along with all data analysis for the results presented here , was carried out using custom software based on the root object - oriented framework  @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution was studied using images of cadmium test charts taken in march 2012 at noboru ( neutron beamline for observation and research use ) , located at beamline 10 of the materials and life science experimental facility ( mlf ) within the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc )  @xcite .",
    "the neutron pulse rate was 25  hz ( for a total neutron band - width at noboru of 10   ) with a beam power of 200  kw , and a @xmath12  mm@xmath13 collimator near the midpoint of the beamline provided a low - dispersion beam suitable for high - resolution imaging .",
    "the detector , located 15  m from the moderator , was filled with ar - c@xmath5h@xmath6-@xmath7he ( 63:7:30 ) at 2  atm and equipped with a 2.5-cm drift cage as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the test charts were placed directly on the entrance window of the detector vessel .",
    "the detector was operated at a gas gain of 470 , unless indicated otherwise .    under these conditions ,",
    "data was taken of one test chart for an exposure time of 7.8 minutes ( not including data read - out time ) , and the resulting images , normalized to the beam profile , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : edge45 ] for the various cuts described below . in the offline analysis ,",
    "neutrons with energy well below the cadmium cut - off were selected by requiring a tof greater than 2.1  ms ( @xmath14  mev , with the lower limit arising from the 10    bandwidth of noboru ) , and the gamma rejection cuts on total energy deposit and proton - triton track length described in our previous work were applied .",
    "images were then reconstructed for three cut cases : 1 ) the above tof and gamma cuts , 2 ) an additional consistency cut on the proton direction , and 3 ) the further requirement that the anode and cathode tot distributions each displayed two distinct peaks ( as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] ) .",
    "the consistency cut required agreement in the component of the proton direction perpendicular to the plane of the @xmath0pic ( determined using the hit times ) as measured independently by the anodes and cathodes . for cut case 1 ,",
    "the inconsistent events were _ corrected _ by changing the proton direction for the component with fewer hits , while they were simply removed in the second case .",

    "future efforts to improve the spatial resolution of our detector will focus on optimization of the gas mixture and reduction of the gain variation and strip pitch of the @xmath0pic . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , optimization of the gas mixture for reduced electron diffusion and/or shorter track lengths is expected to provide a 10 to 15% improvement in the spatial resolution , as determined by simulation . also , as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : unif ] , completely eliminating the gain variation would yield an improvement of around 15% .",
    "the gain variation may be reduced by improving the uniformity of the physical structures of the @xmath0pic through tighter manufacturing controls . furthermore , owing to the low operating gain , it becomes possible to reduce the size of the pixel structures in order to achieve a strip pitch as low as 200  @xmath0 m , allowing us to take fuller advantage of the optimized gas properties .",
    "using our geant4 simulation , we estimate that the spatial resolution would be reduced by @xmath1145% ( or to less than 60  @xmath0 m ) after making all of the above improvements / modifications to the detector , hence achieving a spatial resolution similar to the mcp ( in high - rate mode ) and imaging plates .",
    "additionally , the rate performance of our detector will be significantly improved through a planned upgrade of the encoder hardware . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , our current data acquisition system can handle raw data rates of @xmath11320  mb / s ( transferred to vme memory via a 32-bit parallel bus at 10  mhz ) , corresponding to a neutron count rate of roughly 200  kcps ( kilo counts per second ) for present detector conditions .",
    "preliminary testing of the new encoder system indicates an increase of roughly a factor of four , resulting in a data rate of 12.8  gb / s ( or a neutron rate of 800  kcps ) . for a given data transfer rate",
    ", we can further increase the neutron count rate by reducing the amount of data per event in two ways : 1 ) by increasing the stopping power of the gas for shorter proton - triton track lengths , and 2 ) by performing some simple data processing on the fpga .",
    "for instance , by replacing argon with xenon to reduce track lengths from 8 to 5  mm and calculating tot on the fpga , the amount of data per neutron event would be reduced by a factor of 3.2 , achieving a neutron rate of over 2.5  mcps . to approach the rate performance of the gem - based detector",
    ", we could further reduce the track length to less than 2  mm by increasing the gas pressure above 5  atm , resulting in another factor of 3 or 4 increase in the neutron rate .",
    "unfortunately , this last step would also reduce the spatial resolution ( to the order of the 0.4  mm strip pitch ) , through a combination of increased scattering in the entrance window due to increased vessel thickness , increased electron diffusion , and the fact that we could no longer perform detailed tracking with so few hits per event .",
    "such improvements to the spatial resolution and rate performance will be the subject of future studies .",
    "neutron resonance absorption techniques take advantage of the tendency of some nuclides to preferentially absorb neutrons at specific energies , unique to each nuclide , to study isotopic composition and temperature  @xcite .",
    "resonance absorption can be directly observed by measuring the neutron transmission spectrum of the sample , calculated as :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the intensities measured with and without the sample , respectively . due to the preferential absorption",
    ", the transmission will show sharp drops near a resonance .",
    "such resonances typically occur for neutron energies above 1  ev and should appear in the tof region between 0 and 1  ms for the 15-m flight path used in our experiment .",
    "the strength ( depth ) of the resonance dip gives the isotopic density , while thermal broadening allows us to deduce the temperature within the sample .",
    "the spatial distribution of the density and/or temperature can then be determined by measuring the transmission point - by - point . using a 2-dimensional detector such as ours ,",
    "this kind of measurement is greatly simplified .    as an example",

    "the large resonance dip visible in the transmission of the watch battery around 0.46  ms ( or a neutron energy of @xmath19  ev ) is due to silver present in the battery s cathode ( along with many smaller dips at shorter tofs ) .",

    "( the gamma rejection cuts described in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] are applied in both cases . )",
    "the tof range of [ fig : wimg](b ) selects neutrons with energy near the larger silver resonance , and although statistics are greatly reduced ( necessitating a larger bin size for the image ) , the battery is clearly enhanced relative to the rest of the watch . a quantitative study of the determination of nuclide density via resonance absorption with a @xmath0pic - based neutron imaging detector can be found in ref .",

    "radiographic images of a wristwatch are shown for neutron tof ranges of ( a ) @xmath23  ms and ( b ) @xmath22  ms ( darker areas correspond to higher neutron transmission ) .",
    "the tof range for ( b ) corresponds to a resonance in the absorption cross - section of silver at a neutron energy of 5.2  ev .",
    "bin sizes are ( a ) 80  @xmath0 m and ( b ) 320  @xmath0 m .",
    "light , horizontal bands at the top and bottom of ( a ) are due to the aluminum - backed tape used to hold the watch in place . ]    finally , note that a bragg edge is visible in the spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig : wtrans ] as a jump in the transmission around 15  ms .",
    "such bragg edges appear at the point where the neutron wavelength exceeds the bragg - scattering condition for a particular set of crystal planes , and are observed for energies down to a few mev ( or for a tof up to about 20  ms in the present case ) .",
    "the bragg edge observed here is most likely due to the metal body of the watch . from the position of the bragg edge , one can determine the crystal spacing , and by studying the shape of the spectrum in the vicinity of the edge , one can learn about crystal properties such as grain size and texture  @xcite .",
    "thus , in a single pulsed - beam measurement using a single detector , it is possible to study both the isotopic composition and crystal structure of a sample in two dimensions .",
    "we have introduced a neutron position reconstruction method based on template fitting that improved both the spatial resolution and event reconstruction efficiency of our @xmath0pic - based , time - resolved neutron imaging detector . the spatial resolution achieved with this method",
    "was found to be approximately gaussian with a sigma of @xmath24  @xmath0 m and a non - uniformity of 6.4% rmsd ( reconstruction efficiency @xmath25% ) .",
    "this represents a factor of three improvement over the resolution determined using the simple algorithm of our previous work  @xcite . by using less restrictive cut conditions ,",
    "the reconstruction efficiency was greatly improved , while worsening the spatial resolution by only 14% ( consistency cut , @xmath26% ) and 19% ( tof and gamma cuts only , @xmath27% ) .",
    "additionally , after reducing the gain to the optimum value of 250 and correcting for beam divergence , the spatial resolution of the @xmath0pic would improve to just under 100  @xmath0 m for the tightest cut condition ( or @xmath11120  @xmath0 m for tof and gamma cuts only ) .",
    "the optimum gain setting of 250 also corresponds to that shown in ref .",
    "@xcite to give an effective gamma sensitivity of 10@xmath10 or less .",
    "future improvements in the spatial resolution , to better than 60  @xmath0 m , may be possible through optimization of the gas mixture for reduced electron diffusion , reduction of the gain variation of the @xmath0pic through improved manufacturing controls , and reduction of the strip pitch .    we also demonstrated in the example measurement of sec .",
    "[ sec : watch ] that by combining high - resolution imaging with event - by - event tof measurement , our detector becomes a powerful and flexible tool for radiographic studies at pulsed neutron sources . using such a detector , we can simultaneously record the radiographic image , resonance absorption , and bragg - edge transmission information point - by - point , allowing a variety of material properties , including nuclide composition and density , internal temperature , crystal spacing , grain size and texture , internal strain , etc .",
