    "recently , the measurements of the @xmath14 asymmetry in the nucleon sea indicate a considerable isospin symmetry breaking in the light quark sea of the nucleon .",
    "this indicates that the nucleon contains notable @xmath0 components , if no more exotic components , besides the conventional @xmath13 component@xcite . on the other hand , some experiments on parity violation in electron - proton scattering moreover indicate that the @xmath15 quark pairs lead to nonzero contributions to the magnetic moment of the proton@xcite .",
    "the experimental results on the strangeness magnetic moments can be described , at least qualitatively , by @xmath16 configurations in the proton with the anti - quark is in its s - state and the four quarks subsystem in its p - state@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking large admixture of the pentaquark components to the conventional @xmath13 components , a natural explanation for the mass ordering of the @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 resonances has been given , which is very puzzling in the classic @xmath13 quark model .    in ref.@xcite , the hidden flavor contributions to the baryon octet and decuplet magnetic moments have been investigated , and the results show that the average deviation from the empirical magnetic moment values drops from @xmath20 of the static quark model predictions to @xmath21 when the contributions of the @xmath0 components are taken into account .",
    "the improvement is most notable in the case of the @xmath22(@xmath23 to @xmath24 ) , @xmath25(@xmath26 to @xmath27 ) and @xmath28(@xmath29 to @xmath30 ) .",
    "all these fact above suggest that there are significant @xmath0 components in baryons .    in the case of the charmed and bottomed baryons ,",
    "the masses are much heavier than that of the @xmath31 octet and decuplet , such as that the mass of the @xmath4(@xmath32 ) baryon is about 2286 mev , the @xmath3(@xmath32 ) is about 2455 mev @xcite , and the new measured bottomed baryons @xmath33 mev , @xmath34 mev , @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev @xcite , which may result in that the @xmath0 components play a more important role in the charmed and bottomed baryons . because of that the charm and beauty quarks are much heavier than the light and strange quarks , the @xmath0 components , i.e. the hidden light and strange flavors may have much more significant contributions to the baryon magnetic moments . here the contributions to the @xmath37 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 as well as the @xmath6 and @xmath7 baryons magnetic moments from the @xmath0 wave function components with at most one @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath15 sea quark pair are calculated in the non - relativistic constituent quark model . for the sake of the much heavier masses of the charm and beauty quarks , we neglect the contributions of the @xmath40 and @xmath41 components .",
    "what is interesting is that because the light and strange degrees of freedom are in spin zero configuration for the @xmath4 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the classic @xmath13 quark model , all the magnetic moments of these baryons come from the contributions of the charm quark , if the constituent mass of the charm quark is set to be @xmath44 gev , these magnetic moments will be @xmath12 .",
    "but the magnetic moments of these baryons should be different when the contributions of the @xmath0 components in these baryons are taken into account , for the different flavor - spin configurations of the 5q components in these baryons . in this manuscript",
    ", it s shown that the differences are independent of the constituent mass of the charm quark .",
    "the present manuscript is organized in the following way . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "the explicit flavor wave functions of the @xmath0 components in the charmed and bottomed baryons are given .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] contains the expressions and the corresponding numerical results for the charmed baryons .",
    "the corresponding expressions and numerical results for the @xmath6 and @xmath7 magnetic moments are given in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "finally section [ sec:5 ] contains a concluding discussion of this manuscript .",
    "a baryon wave function that includes @xmath45 components in addition to the conventional @xmath13 components may be written in the following general form :    @xmath46    here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the probabilities of the @xmath13 and @xmath0 components respectively ; the sum over i runs over all the possible @xmath49 components , and @xmath50 denotes the amplitude of the corresponding 5q component .",
    "the flavor ( and spin ) wave functions of every @xmath49 is constructed along with a calculation of the corresponding amplitudes @xmath50 .",
    "the wave functions of the @xmath13 components in the baryons are the conventional ones , which are formed as combinations of the color , space , flavor and spin wave functions with appropriate clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "the ground states of the @xmath1 baryons can be in the spin states @xmath51_{s}$ ] and @xmath52_{s}$ ] , i.e. the flavor - spin states are @xmath52_{fs}[21]_{f}[21]_{s}$ ] and @xmath52_{fs}[3]_{f}[3]_{s}$ ] in the static @xmath13 model , respectively .",
    "here we consider the previous ones , @xmath53 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 baryons .",
    "the spectra of the @xmath2 charmed baryons , each with one charm quark , in the classic @xmath13 quark model , is just like that of the ones which have one or more strange quarks in the octet .",
    "for instance , the @xmath4 and @xmath3 spectra ought to look much like that of the @xmath28 and @xmath54 , since a @xmath4 or a @xmath3 is obtained from a @xmath28 or a @xmath54 by changing the s quark to a c quark . but",
    "the @xmath55 baryons have more than one strange quarks , then the @xmath56 spectra is some more complicated than the @xmath55 spectra .",
    "one may group the @xmath56 baryons as that the strange and the light quarks are symmetric or the strange and the light quark are anti - symmetric , i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath5 .",
    "we only consider the @xmath5 baryons in this manuscript .",
    "as we have discussed above , the wave functions of the @xmath13 components in the charmed baryons are the conventional ones , with flavor - spin symmetry @xmath52_{fs}[21]_{f}[21]_{s}$ ] , where @xmath58_{i}$ ] denotes the young pattern with f being the sequence of the integers that indicates the number of boxes in the successive rows of the young patterns . and",
    "this should be combined with the totally symmetric orbital state @xmath52_{x}$ ] and the antisymmetric color state @xmath59_{c}$ ] to form the completely antisymmetric state which is required by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "if the hyperfine interaction between the quarks depends on spin and flavor are employed @xcite , the @xmath60 subsystem with the mixed spatial symmetry @xmath61_{x}$ ] are expected to be the configurations with the lowest energy , and therefore most likely to form appreciable @xmath0 components of the charm baryons .",
    "consequently the flavor - spin state of the @xmath60 subsystem is most likely totally symmetric : @xmath62_{fs}$ ] .",
    "moreover in the case of the @xmath63 charmed baryons , the flavor - spin configurations of the four quark subsystem @xmath62_{fs}[22]_{f}[22]_{s}$ ] , with one quark in its first orbitally excited state , and the anti - quark in its ground state , is likely to have the lowest energy @xcite .",
    "the flavor wave functions of the @xmath0 components in the charmed baryons are listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the weight method @xcite has been employed here for the explicit construction of the flavor wave functions in @xmath49 configurations .",
    "actually , these flavor wave functions can be obtained directly from that in table [ table3 ] in ref.@xcite , with the substitution of the charm quark for the valence strange quark .",
    "notice that there is a typo in table in ref .",
    "@xcite : the flavor wave function in the fifth row with flavor symmetry @xmath64_{f}$ ] should be : @xmath65 . the new feature is the appearance of the states @xmath66 and @xmath67 , here we give the flavor wave functions of @xmath5 baryons employing the weight diagram method , where the superscripts a on the @xmath56 states indicate that the valence light and strange quarks are in antisymmetric states , the results are shown in table [ table1 ] .",
    ".the flavor wave functions of the @xmath0 components in the charmed baryons . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table8 ]    the numerical results will vary a bit with the proportion of the @xmath0 components changed .",
    "for instance , if we increase it to the value @xmath68 , these magnetic moments will be @xmath69 n. m. , @xmath70 n. m. , @xmath71 n. m. and @xmath72 n. m. , which means that the increasing of the @xmath48 will make the absolute value of these magnetic moments decreased .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , they give the prediction that the magnetic moments of the b - baryons in the @xmath73 of @xmath31 can be obtained by the same analysis as the c - baryons in @xmath73 , which means that some correction will be added to the value @xmath74 from the constituent quark model , which will lead to three different magnetic moments . here if we take into account the contributions of the @xmath0 components , we can also get the same prediction , and the difference of the three magnetic moments should be independent with constituent mass of the bottom quark .",
    "here the charmed and bottomed baryons magnetic moments have been computed within the framework of the non - relativistic constituent quark model , and the influence of the light and strange @xmath8 pairs has been investigated .",
    "in addition explicit expressions of the wave functions for all the possible @xmath45 components in the charmed and bottomed baryons are given .",
    "the calculated magnetic moments include the contributions from the @xmath13 components and the @xmath45 components with both of light and strange @xmath75 pairs .",
    "the magnetic moment expressions readily allow separation of the strangeness components from @xmath76 pairs as well as individual components from @xmath77 and @xmath78 pairs .",
    "our main conclusion is that , the @xmath0 components , i.e. the hidden light and strange flavors , have notable contributions to the charmed baryons magnetic moments .",
    "of course , the additional @xmath0 components contributions also lead to notable corrections to the bottomed baryons magnetic moments .",
    "the numerical results are shown in table [ table5 ] and [ table8 ] , with a @xmath79 admixtures of the @xmath0 components in the baryons .    as we have discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the restriction in the calculation of the charmed baryon and @xmath6 magnetic moments to the configuration with flavor - spin symmetry @xmath62_{fs}[22]_f[22]_s$ ] given in table [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] , is motivated by its expected low energy . the configuration with @xmath62_{fs}[31]_f[31]_s$ ] symmetry",
    "is expected to have the next lowest energy and to give an at most very insignificant contribution to the magnetic moments . in the case of the @xmath7",
    "this configuration is , however , expected to have the lowest energy as the configuration @xmath62_{fs}[22]_f[22]_s$ ] can not contribute @xcite .",
    "it is of course not in any way obvious that those @xmath45 configurations that have the lowest energy for a given hyperfine interaction model should have the largest probability in the baryons .",
    "the main terms should be expected to be those with the strongest coupling to the @xmath13 component .",
    "this coupling depends both on the confining interaction and ( inversely ) on the difference in energy from the rest energy of the baryons .",
