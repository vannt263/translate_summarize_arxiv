    "entanglement as a quantum resource is important for a range of emerging applications , including quantum computing @xcite and quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "a main obstacle to the development of entanglement - based systems is decoherence associated with the unavoidable coupling between a quantum system and the degrees of freedom of the surrounding environment @xcite .",
    "however , reservoir engineering methods have changed the idea of trying to minimize coupling to the environment to one of modifying the properties of the environment in order to achieve a desired state .",
    "these methods include using dissipative dynamics @xcite , recently extended to systems out of thermal equilibrium @xcite , as well as , e.g. , exploiting the effect of measurements and feedback to achieve a desired final state @xcite .",
    "another emerging resource for reservoir engineering is the use of nonreciprocal environments @xcite .",
    "in particular , there has been considerable investigation of quantum spin networks in chiral waveguides @xcite . the previous work on spin dynamics in quantum chiral environments",
    "has focused on one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide models . here , we investigate two - level ( spin ) quibit interactions mediated by uni - directional surface - plasmon - polaritions ( spps ) at the interface of a photonic topological insulator ( pti ) and a topological - trivial material .",
    "ptis represent a broad class of materials that are attracting wide interest for both fundamental and applied reasons @xcite .",
    "perhaps their most celebrated aspect is their ability to support spps that are unidirectional , propagate in the bulk bandgap , and are topologically protected from backscattering at discontinuities @xcite .",
    "ptis can be broadly divided into two classes , ( i ) those with broken time reversal ( tr ) symmetry , which are photonic analogs of quantum hall insulators ( photonic quantum hall effect ( pqhe ) ) , and ( ii ) those that are time - reversal - invariant but have broken inversion symmetry , which are photonic analogs of electronic topological insulators / quantum spin hall insulators ( photonic quantum spin hall effect ( pqshe ) ) .",
    "although as a specific example we consider ptis of the pqhe type , the formulation presented here is general .    in this work ,",
    "we develop a master equation ( me ) for three - dimensional ( 3d ) , nonreciprocal , inhomogeneous and lossy environments , based on the canonical quantization scheme described in @xcite , extended to nonreciprocal media @xcite . in section [ me1 ]",
    "we derive the master equation , and in section [ cs ] we present the equations for concurrence as a measure of entanglement . in section [ nr ]",
    "we consider the topological aspect of concurrence for a pqhe - type pti system consisting of a plasma continuum .",
    "then , qubit entanglement dynamics are examined for several waveguiding systems .",
    "we focus of the aspects unique to the topological and nonreciprocal environment , such as the preservation of entanglement in the presence of large defects .",
    "three appendices present a discussion of various approximations used in the development of the me , a comparison with previous 1d chiral mes , and a derivation of the unidirectional concurrence .",
    "in this section , we first derive a general me valid for both reciprocal and nonreciprocal , inhomogeneous and lossy environments . this form is valid for 3d , 2d and 1d systems since it is expressed in terms of the electromagnetic green function .",
    "then , we present concurrence expressions for the unidirectional case .",
