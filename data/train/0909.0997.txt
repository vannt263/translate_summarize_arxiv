    "one of the overarching themes of the science of complex many - body systems is to understand the remarkable regularities they often exhibit and try to relate these to underlying symmetries of the system . in nuclei",
    ", this challenge is approached through the use of geometric and algebraic models that describe collective behavior of the nuclear system .",
    "there are a large number and variety of such models , each with seemingly unique properties and predictions",
    ". nevertheless , careful analysis often shows relations among such models that have escaped notice and therefore leads to a better understanding of their mutual interrelationships and often , to experimental tests and constraints on their applicability .",
    "in the present work , we will focus on the properties of subsets of @xmath0 states in nuclei .",
    "in general , @xmath0 states are of fundamental importance since they are easily observed experimentally in reactions such as few nucleon transfer @xcite or beta decay @xcite .",
    "although not all @xmath0 states are collective in nature , they are always intrinsic excitations of the ground state condensate , and are free of some of the complications ( such as centrifugal effects ) present in other states . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the properties of a subset of collective @xmath0 states .",
    "we will show that broad classes of seemingly diverse models actually yield identical predictions for that subset of @xmath0 states .",
    "one upshot of this analysis will be the development of extremely simple , analytic eigenvalue expressions which , in one case , depend only on the dimensionality of the system and , in another , turn out to transcend the symmetry structure .",
    "and x(5)-@xmath1 span structures between a vibrator and the critical point symmetries.,height=377 ]    our approach primarily exploits two classes of models , namely the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) model and geometric descriptions of nuclei at critical points of quantum phase transitions in their equilibrium structure . therefore , we start by briefly recalling pertinent features of these models .",
    "the interacting boson approximation model  @xcite describes collective structure in terms of bosons of angular momentum zero ( @xmath2-bosons ) and two ( @xmath3-bosons ) in the framework of an overall u(6 ) symmetry .",
    "emerging from the u(6 ) symmetry group structure are three dynamical symmetries which have long been benchmark paradigms of structure : u(5 ) , which gives vibrational structure characteristic of spherical nuclei , su(3 ) , which describes axially symmetric deformed rotors , and o(6 ) , which pertains to deformed nuclei that are soft with respect to axial asymmetry ( @xmath4-soft ) .",
    "shape / phase transitions in atomic nuclei were discussed  @xcite many years ago in the classical analog  @xcite of the iba .    to visualize these limiting symmetries and the transitions between them ,",
    "it is common to place them at the corners of a symmetry triangle  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "1(top ) . in the iba framework ,",
    "a point of first order phase transition occurs between u(5 ) and su(3 ) , while a point of second order phase transition occurs between u(5 ) and o(6 ) .",
    "the triangle is divided into two regions , spherical and deformed , by a narrow shape coexistence region  @xcite extending around the line of first order phase transition connecting the two points mentioned above . in the classical limit of the iba , obtained through use of the intrinsic state formalism @xcite",

    "@xcite.,height=226 ]    more recently , phase transitions have been investigated in a geometrical framework .",
    "the critical point symmetries e(5 )  @xcite and x(5 )  @xcite have been developed to describe phase / shape transitions between vibrational to @xmath4-soft and vibrational to axially symmetric deformed , respectively , using special solutions of the bohr hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "these solutions are analytic and parameter free , except for scale . in fig .",
    "1(bottom ) , we indicate their position close to the critical point of a phase transition in a symmetry triangle for geometrical models .",
    "the concept of critical point symmetries ( cps ) is supported by the observation of nuclei exhibiting such properties  @xcite .",
    "their success has spawned the development of numerous additional geometrical models , several of which offer analytic solutions and cover a wider range of structures both before and after the phase transitional point .",
    "links between the geometrical approach and the iba formalism have also found renewed interest . a powerful method for solving the bohr hamiltonian",
    "numerically has recently been developed  @xcite , leading to an algebraic collective model  @xcite .",
    "examples of the use of this method have recently been presented @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the algebraic collective model and the different limiting symmetries of the iba has been studied in refs .",
    "the connection between geometrical models spanning structure near e(5 ) and the iba has also been investigated  @xcite .    a key prediction of the cps involves the energy of the first excited @xmath0 state .",
    "the nature of low - lying @xmath0 states is critical to understanding the structure of nuclei and changes in structure  @xcite . while there is some debate as to the nature  @xcite of low - lying @xmath0 states",
    ", the fact that the energies of @xmath0 states evolve rather smoothly as a function of changing structure can not be ignored .",

    "the primary purpose of the present work is to investigate the energies of @xmath0 states in a wide range of models . in some cases the analysis applies to all collective @xmath0 states , in others to classes of @xmath0 states that act as bandheads for major families of states . for a broad class of models",
    ", we will discuss some remarkable regularities , develop analytic expressions for the eigenvalues of these states that depend only on the dimensionality of the system , relate these results to more general models , and discuss the group theoretical properties underlying these regularities .",
    "we begin within the framework of the different solutions of the bohr hamiltonian .",
    "we then do a similar analysis within the framework of the iba and then finally investigate the links between these two different approaches . some of this material has been previously summarized  @xcite .",
    "numerous models are emerging which provide a reasonable description of nuclei using an infinite square well potential .",
    "e(5 ) and x(5 ) are special solutions of the bohr hamiltonian describing collective nuclear properties in terms of the shape variables @xmath16 and @xmath4 .",
    "both take the potential in @xmath16 as an infinite square well but use different potentials in @xmath4 ; x(5 ) uses a harmonic oscillator potential in @xmath4 which has a minimum at @xmath17 whereas e(5 ) takes a potential independent of @xmath4 .",
    "additional solutions which make use of infinite square well potentials in @xmath16 include z(5 )  @xcite , which uses a harmonic oscillator potential in @xmath4 with a minimum at @xmath4 = 30@xmath18 , z(4 )  @xcite where @xmath4 is frozen to 30@xmath18 , and x(3 )  @xcite where @xmath4 is fixed at 0@xmath18 .    in each of the infinite square well solutions ,",
    "the energy eigenvalues are proportional to the squares of roots of the bessel functions , @xmath19 , where the order @xmath20 is different for each solution .",

    "the dimension effectively refers to the number of degrees of freedom of the model .",
    "for example , the five dimensional models are described by @xmath16 , @xmath4 and the three euler angles .    in the x(3 ) and z(4 ) models , we consider all excited @xmath0 states . in x(5 ) and z(5 ) , the solutions are obtained through an approximate separation of the @xmath16 and @xmath4 degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider those @xmath0 states arising from the @xmath16 solution , as they are directly related to the infinite square well potential . in the e(5 ) solution , we consider those @xmath0 states with @xmath23 = 0 , that is , those @xmath0 states which correspond to base states on which major families of levels are built .",

    "this occurs very close to , but just beyond , the critical point ( @xmath30 for @xmath31=250 ) of the phase transition .",
    "numerical results of the above iba calculation are given in table v and compared with simple analytic formulas .",

    "very good agreement is obtained up to @xmath34 .",
    "this result is what might be expected given the similarity of the iba coherent state energy functional at the critical point with an infinite square well potential .",

    "these degeneracies hold to the 10 percent level for @xmath47 .",
    "in summary , iba @xmath0 states ( in the large boson number limit ) near the critical point on the u(5)-su(3 ) line exhibit the same @xmath33 behavior seen in geometrical models involving infinite square well potentials .",
    "furthermore , these @xmath0 states demonstrate approximate degeneracies with alternate members of the ground state band , calling for further investigations .",

    "the same regular behavior for @xmath0 states has been found in iba calculations ( in the large boson number limit ) near the critical point of the first order phase transition between u(5 ) and su(3 ) , despite the fact that in all three limiting symmetries of the iba ( in the large boson number limit ) the same @xmath0 states exhibit a harmonic behavior .",
