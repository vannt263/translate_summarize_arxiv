    "over the past 10 years , physicists have made a significant effort to understand unusual critical phenomena in complex network systems @xcite .",
    "most of the real - world complex networks have been revealed as scale - free ( sf ) in the degree distribution , @xmath8 , where degree @xmath9 is the number of edges connected to a given vertex and @xmath1 is the degree exponent @xcite .",
    "the critical phenomena of spin systems on such sf networks have been expected differ from those in euclidean space . according to various studies @xcite , the critical behavior of the ferromagnetic ising model on sf networks has a strong dependence on the degree distribution .",
    "a spin - glass model has also demonstrated anomalous critical phenomena on sf networks .",
    "the previous analytical study of the ising spin - glass model on sf networks @xcite showed that the phase diagrams consisting of the paramagnetic ( pm ) , ferromagnetic ( fm ) , and spin - glass ( sg ) phases were strongly dependent on the given degree distribution , and the transition temperature @xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) between the pm - sg ( pm - fm ) phases became infinite for @xmath7 .",
    "then , provided an sg model based on the non - ising type is now considered in sf networks , how will its critical phenomena be changed ?",
    "until now , little research has been conducted to answer this interesting question .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate critical phenomena in sf networks by introducing a new non - ising - type sg model . for this purpose , we consider the ghatak - sherrington ( gs ) model @xcite , a spin-1 sg model with a crystal field .",
    "recently , the gs model has become well known as a prototypical model for inverse transition @xcite .",
    "inverse transition ( melting or freezing ) occurs when an ordered phase is more entropic than a disordered one . as a result",
    ", the ordered phase appears at a higher temperature than the disordered one .",
    "such inverse transitions have been experimentally observed in various physical systems , such as polymers @xcite , high-@xmath10 superconductors @xcite , magnetic thin films @xcite , and organic monolayers @xcite . the gs model in euclidean space shows",
    "inverse freezing , wherein the sg phase becomes the one with higher entropy .    nowadays",
    ", the gs and analogous models with a crystal field have drawn attention by the observation of a  bose glass \" of field - induced magnetic quasiparticles in a doped quantum magnet @xcite .",
    "in addition , erichsen _ et al . _ obtained the analytical solutions of the gs model with finite connectivity and found inverse transitions @xcite by extending the techniques of the previous ising spin - glass model with finite connectivity @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a quantum version of the gs model with a transverse tunneling field exhibited a peculiar phenomenon of the splitting within one sg phase , depending on the values of crystal and transverse fields @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will study the gs - based sg model on sf networks in order to obtain its analytical solutions , i.e. , free energy and order parameters , and various phase diagrams . from these solutions",
    ", we can expect two simultaneous unique features when an alternative sg model , based on the gs model , is studied in sf networks .",
    "one such feature is that the alternative model may contain an inverse transition similar to that of the gs model in euclidean space .",
    "the other is that phase diagrams and transition temperatures obtained from the alternative model may exhibit a new dependence of the degree distribution of the considered sf network .",
    "however , the divergence of transition temperatures , shown in the ising spin - glass model on sf networks with @xmath7 , may disappear in the alternative model under the same degree distributions .",
    "the following analysis on the alternative model will give clear answers about such expectations .",
    "now , we will investigate the critical phenomena by considering the gs model on sf networks .",
    "the sf networks , on which the gs model is placed , are constructed by the static model .",
    "based on the replica - symmetric solution , we thereby obtain the analytical solutions , i.e. , free energy and order parameters .      in order to construct sf networks , on which spin system is placed ,",
    "we follow the process of the static model , where the name  static \" originates from the fact that the number of vertices is fixed from the beginning @xcite .",
    "this model has the advantage for analytical calculations of its theoretical quantities , such as free energy and order parameters @xcite .",
    "the general random graph under the static model is constructed as follows @xcite : the number of vertices @xmath11 is fixed at the beginning .",
    "each vertex @xmath12 @xmath13 is assigned a weight @xmath14 .",
    "a pair of vertices @xmath15 is chosen with the probabilities @xmath14 and @xmath16 , respectively , and they are connected with an edge , unless the pair is already connected .",
    "this process is repeated @xmath17 times . in such random networks , the probability that a given pair of vertices @xmath15 ( @xmath18 ) is not connected by an edge , as denoted by @xmath19 , is given by @xmath20 , while the connection probability @xmath21 .    for the erds - rnyi ( er ) graph @xcite , the weight is given as @xmath22 , independent of the index @xmath12 . since @xmath23 ,",
    "the fraction of bonds present becomes @xmath24 and the average number of the connected edges is @xmath17 .",
    "so @xmath2 becomes the mean degree in the er graph .",
    "for the static sf network , the weights are given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a control parameter in the range @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . then the resulting network is an sf network with a power - law degree distribution , @xmath8 , with @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath30 for finite @xmath2 , except @xmath31 for @xmath7 and @xmath32 . therefore , the mean degree of a vertex @xmath12 is @xmath33 and the mean degree of the network is @xmath2 @xcite . when @xmath2 approaches @xmath11 , this network becomes a fully - connected one or a regular lattice with infinite - range interaction .",
    "therefore , we can say that the mean degree @xmath2 in this model plays a role similar to the physical dimension for spin systems on lattices .",
    "now we consider an alternative sg model on static sf networks .",
    "the sg transitions in euclidean space have already been studied by means of various theoretical methods @xcite .",
    "most of such studies have concentrated on regular lattices or the infinite - range interaction model on fully connected graphs . to study the sg transitions on the static sf networks , we follow the previous approach of the dilute ising sg model with infinite - range interactions , i.e. , the ising sg model on the er graph , first performed by viana and bray @xcite , and applied successfully to the ising sg model on the static sf networks @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the gs model on a graph @xmath34 constructed by the static model is given as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is nonzero only when the vertices @xmath12 and @xmath37 are connected in @xmath34 .",
    "for the static model , the probability of @xmath34 in the quenched random network ensemble is defined as @xmath38 with @xmath39 , @xmath14 being given in eq.(1 ) .",
    "then , the ensemble average for a given physical quantity @xmath40 is taken as @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the average over different graph configurations . in the sg problem ,",
    "the coupling strengths @xmath43 are also quenched random variables .",
    "we assume that each @xmath36 is given as @xmath44 or @xmath45 with probabilities @xmath3 and @xmath46 , respectively , so the coupling strength distribution is given as @xmath47.\\ ] ] the case of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) corresponds to the fully frustrated ( purely ferromagnetic ) case , and we consider @xmath3 in the range of @xmath50 throughout this work .",
    "then the ensemble average for a given physical quantity , @xmath40 , is taken as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an average over the quenched disorder of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , the free energy @xmath53 is evaluated as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the partition function for a given distribution of @xmath43 on a particular graph @xmath34 .    here",
    ", the replica method is used to evaluate the free energy , i.e. , @xmath56/n$ ] . to proceed ,",
    "we evaluate the @xmath57-th power of the partition function @xmath58 ,    @xmath59 , \\label{z_n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      are the order parameters of the spin glass system , called the magnetization , the spin self - interaction , the spin - glass order parameter , and so on .",
    "the average is evaluated through @xmath78 .",
    "now we consider the replica - symmetric ( rs ) case , in which spins with different replica indices are indistinguishable , for simplicity .",
    "furthermore , since order parameters such as @xmath79 are too complex to be obtained , for the present , we follow an approach that is similar in spirit to the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , in which terms that are higher in order than @xmath73 in eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) are neglected .",
    "we thus determine the phase boundaries of the pm , fm , and sg phases through the rs solution with three order parameters : the rs magnetization , the rs spin self - interaction , and the rs sg order parameter are denoted as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively , and the free energy in eq.(9 ) is truncated at the order of @xmath83 .",
    "then we obtain the rs intensive free energy as follows :    @xmath84.\\ ] ]    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "we can determine @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 by imposing the condition that @xmath91 resumes the stable extrema when they are the replica - symmetric solutions .",
    "from this extremal condition , we can obtain the self - consistent equations of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) as follows : @xmath93\\\\ r & = & \\int \\mathcal{d}z~ \\sum_{i } p_{i}\\bigg[\\frac{2e^{\\gamma_{i } } \\cosh \\eta_{i}(z)}{1 + 2e^{\\gamma_{i } } \\cosh \\eta_{i}(z)}\\bigg]\\\\ q & = & \\int \\mathcal{d}z~ \\sum_{i } p_{i}\\bigg[\\frac{2e^{\\gamma_{i } } \\sinh \\eta_{i}(z)}{1 + 2e^{\\gamma_{i } } \\cosh \\eta_{i}(z ) } \\bigg]^{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , we consider three phases : pm ( @xmath94 ) , sg ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , and fm ( @xmath97 , @xmath96 ) . under certain conditions",
    ", there exists a multicritical point at which the pm - sg - fm phases merge .",
    "in addition to the pm , sg , and fm phases , the mixed ( m ) phase is sometimes present in the present model .",
    "the m phase is defined as the re - entrant sg phase with nonzero ferromagnetic order ( @xmath97 , @xmath96 ) , located below the fm phase @xcite .",
    "the sg - m phase boundary is determined as the vertical straight line ( toulouse line ) from the multicritical point to @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the phase boundary between the replica symmetric phase ( pm , fm ) and the replica - symmetry - broken phase ( sg , m ) is determined by using the almeida - thouless ( at ) line @xcite ,    @xmath99 \\equiv   ( k \\mathbf{t}_{2})^{-1 } - \\int \\mathcal{d}z \\sum_{i } n p_{i}^2~ \\bigg[\\frac{4e^{2\\gamma_{i } } ( 2e^{\\gamma_{i } } + \\cosh \\eta_{i}(z))^{2 } } { ( 1 + 2e^{\\gamma_{i } } \\cosh \\eta_{i}(z))^{4 } } \\bigg ] = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    both the pm - sg phase boundary and the fm - m phase boundary are determined by the at line .",
    "note that the rs solutions [ eqs .",
    "( 14)-(16 ) ] are unstable below the at line , i.e. , inside the sg and m phases",
    ". we can thus complete the phase diagrams of the present model from these equations .",
    "we consider four phases : pm ( @xmath94 , @xmath100>0 $ ] ) , sg ( @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath100<0 $ ] ) , fm ( @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath100>0 $ ] ) , and m ( @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath100<0 $ ] ) .",
    "note that the er - type model can be obtained when we select the weight @xmath22 .",
    "then our results ( @xmath91 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath100 $ ] ) become simpler and independent of index @xmath12 . then the results appear mathematically identical to those of the gs model , except for the following main difference : instead of @xmath101 of the gs model , @xmath102 is used in the er - type model . the difference may be overcome when @xmath103 , i.e. , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , in @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the main region of the inverse transitions , the gs model and the present model have very distinctive characteristics , in spite of the mathematical similarity of the results .",
    "moreover , when @xmath14 depends on index @xmath12 in the sf model , the distinctiveness becomes larger .",
    "the distribution of @xmath36 also differs between the two models : while the present model is based on the @xmath108 model , the gs model has a gaussian distribution of @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , we may not obtain any meaningful information from the simple and direct comparison between the results of these two models .",
    "the present model demonstrates a huge difference from the previous ising sg model @xcite , in that our model has no divergence of @xmath6 in the region @xmath7 : for the previous ising sg model @xcite , @xmath88 and @xmath90 approach zero near the pm - sg phase boundary , so the key term comprising free energy , @xmath109 $ ] in eq.(20 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , can be expanded by a series expansion of @xmath110 and @xmath111 , i.e. , the even multiples of small @xmath112 . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the term @xmath113 of the model was introduced by the series expansion , and the divergence of @xmath6 in the region @xmath7 occurred with the introduction of @xmath113 .",
    "however , the present model does not allow for such a series expansion : @xmath114 in eq.(13 ) is always larger than 1 , although @xmath88 and @xmath90 approach zero near the pm - sg phase boundary . here",
    ", the  1 \" of @xmath114 results from @xmath5 , which is the differentiating spin value of the present model from the previous one .",
    "thus , the present model has no room for the introduction of @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , this model has no reason for any divergence of @xmath6 in the region @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath6 in @xmath115 thus has a finite value , which is the main difference from the result of the previous model .      in the previous subsection",
    ", we neglected such terms that are higher in order than @xmath73 in eqs.(9 ) and ( 10 ) .",
    "now we consider the perturbative approach @xcite , by which we expand the term of @xmath116 in eq.(9 ) up to fourth order . through this approach ,",
    "we obtain the order parameters @xmath71 , @xmath117 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath118 , @xmath76 and so on . for simplicity",
    ", we use the notations defined by @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "let @xmath130 represent a subset of the replica indices @xmath131 .",
    "then it is convenient to denote the set @xmath132 as @xmath133 .",
    "we also write @xmath134 . with these notations , @xmath135 where the sum is over all subsets of @xmath136 except the null set , and @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "this perturbative approach is to expand @xmath139 and keep only the terms up to fourth order .",

    "@xcite , so order parameters @xmath146 can show singularities by divergences of @xmath6 ( or @xmath10 ) depending on the @xmath1 value .",
    "however , the existence of the  1 \" blocks any possibility of their singularity depending on @xmath1 value .",
    "furthermore , terms having higher order @xmath147 , such as @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 terms , in eq.(19 ) are smaller than the rest ones , so the contributions by higher order terms such as @xmath151 or @xmath152 may be negligible compared with those by @xmath153 and @xmath154 near the phase transition points in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , it becomes sufficiently meaningful to consider only the three rs order parameters @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 given in eqs .",

    "furthermore , @xmath6 approaches a finite value as @xmath115 .",
    "it is well known that a sf network with a finite @xmath1 value over 2.0 has a few hubs holding together numerous vertices with small degrees , but the er network does not have such a hub .",
    "therefore , as @xmath1 increases gradually from 2.0 , the number of hubs inside the sf network also decreases .",
    "since the hubs have a large value of degrees , they tend to be frustrated by spins of numerous neighbor vertices .",
    "since sg is defined as a complex system characterized by frustration , if the hubs under consideration have frustration , they play a crucial role in maintaining sg glass phase against any variation of physical parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath161 .",
    "as @xmath1 increases from 2.0 , @xmath6 thus decreases in proportion to the decrease of hubs .    in fig .",

    "this inverse transition thus corresponds to inverse freezing , according to the definition of schupper and shnerb @xcite .",
    "inverse freezing depends on the value of @xmath1 : as @xmath1 increases from 2.0 , @xmath6 decreases but @xmath165 increases , because the range of the sg phase becomes narrower .",

    "7 , we can draw the phase diagrams for all possible @xmath11 networks .",
    "therefore , we can say that our previous results obtained from @xmath200 are still practically useful , even for the analysis of networks with very large @xmath11 .",
    "we have studied the inverse transitions on sf networks through the static model . as already proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , the static model enables one to study the sg problem by generalizing the dilute ising spin - glass model with infinite - range interactions to a model with inhomogeneous vertex weights .",
    "we could also obtain the phase diagrams consisting of pm , fm , sg , and m phases , as functions of temperature @xmath0 , the degree exponent @xmath1 , the mean degree @xmath2 , and the fraction of the ferromagnetic interactions @xmath3 . however , the present model is based on the gs model , which considers the three states , including the @xmath5 state , contrary to the ising - based model , which considers only @xmath205 .",
    "the @xmath5 state makes an essential feature when compared with the previous model @xcite : @xmath6 has a finite value even when @xmath7 .",
    "this feature is opposite to the previous model , in which @xmath6 is infinite for @xmath7 .",
    "furthermore , when crystal field @xmath161 has nonzero values , the present model shows three types of inverse transitions under specific conditions of parameters @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the inverse freezing occurs in the order of pm @xmath166 sg @xmath167 pm , as the temperature is reduced .",
    "the inverse melting occurs in the order of pm @xmath166 fm @xmath167 pm .",
    "the third case can also occur in the order of pm @xmath166 fm @xmath166 m @xmath167 pm .",
    "therefore , these two main results of the present model have special features as follows : until now , there have been few network models which do not contain the divergence of transitions for @xmath7 .",
    "the present model may thus be considered as an original one to reveal critical behavior by including the third spin state ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in addition , the present model has a merit in that three types of inverse transitions can be simultaneously investigated by one type of model .",
    "our investigations could be helpful in the understanding of various patterns in real systems with competing interactions , such as social networks .",
    "usually , ising - like two - spin states may be considered to represent two different opinions in a society . in a similar way",
    ", we can apply the present model with three - spin states to a real - world three - state systems .",
    "one good example is the presidential elections carried out in many countries . when there are two candidates running for election , one segment of the people vote for a candidate in the ruling party , while others vote for a candidate in the opposition party , and the remaining portion abstains from voting in the election .",
    "the existence of such abstentions is given by floating voters , who show frustration in deciding between the two candidates .",
    "since sg is characterized by frustration , the sg phase can be a good analogy for a frustrated state in which the majority of people are floating voters , in spite of their firm will to vote .",
    "similarly , the pm phase can express a state with nearly the same number of supporters for the two candidates , the fm phase is a state with a superiority of one party , and the m phase is a complex state , including both a little superiority of one party and floating voters .",
    "the result of the election , i.e. , selection of the phase , can be determined by several external conditions , such as a degree of election fever ( @xmath0 ) , a degree of social mood toward indifference to the election ( @xmath161 ) , a relative approval rating by a public opinion poll ( @xmath3 ) , a degree exponent reflecting the network topology of the country holding the election ( @xmath1 ) , and a mean degree of people in the country ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "when @xmath161 is zero , the sg phase by floating voters may be found even for the case of a very low election fever .",
    "however , when @xmath161 is nonzero , the pm phase made by people who are indifferent to the election can be found for low election fever .",
    "further research based on the data of real votes may prove the usefulness of the present model .",
    "we believe that the methods we used here can be applied to other spin systems placed on sf networks .",
    "moreover , we expect that the present model will help us extend our perspective of sg systems and of inverse transitions not only in theoretical models but also in real - world systems .",
