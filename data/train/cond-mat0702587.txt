    ", width=302 ]    in the insulating state ( @xmath82 ) , the monotonic enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility appears within low field region at the wide temperature region .",
    "then , obtained phase boundary always shifts to the high temperature region with an increase of the external field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : apb](a ) ) . for the semi - metallic case ( @xmath81 ) in the higher temperature region ,",
    "the structure of the perpendicular susceptibility is similar to the insulating case , so that the phase boundary shows also monotonic shift to the higher temperature region for the external field .",
    "thus the phase boundary also becomes the structure of fig .",
    "[ fig : apb](a ) .    on the other hand , for the semi - metallic case ( @xmath81 ) in very low temperature region ,",
    "the perpendicular susceptibility becomes the concave structure within the low field region .",
    "thus , when the magnetic order is realized in this temperature region , the phase boundary may become nontrivial structure ( fig .",

    "the enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibilities by the external field can appear in the insulating states with a small gap .",

    "in very low temperature region , the perpendicular susceptibility for the external field becomes concave structure , so that the phase - boundary may become the nontrivial structure .    in order to realize anomalous phase diagrams in the realistic semi - metallic / insulating materials ,",
    "following conditions are required : ( 1 ) both the overlap and gap between two bands are sufficiently small ; ( 2 ) the fermi surfaces for electrons and holes in the semi - metallic state are very small spheres .",
    "( 3 ) the change of the density of states close to the fermi level caused by @xmath34 becomes conspicuous ; ( 4 ) the curvature of one band dispersion is close to that of the other .",
    "we have investigated the conditions for the appearance of the anomalous temperature vs. external field phase diagram in low - carrier two - band systems with a narrow gap or a small - overlap ( semi - metal ) . employing the periodic anderson model and the parabolic dispersion model close to the fermi level",
    ", the magnetic susceptibilities are calculated by using rpa and magnetic properties are discussed under the external field .    for the filled - skutterudite compound ceos@xmath0sb@xmath1",
    "whose energy dispersions may have the semi - metallic band structure , we construct the effective model by employing the periodic anderson model with the dispersive @xmath2 band , which reproduces the main features of the lda result close to the fermi level . considering magnetic properties , we show that the enhancement of the perpendicular susceptibility for the external field is related to the anomalous phase diagram observed in experimental results .",
    "we further introduce the two - band model with the parabolic dispersion in order to clarify the origin of the anomalous phase boundary .",
    "the structure of the perpendicular susceptibility for the external field is discussed in detail .",
    "when a small insulating gap exists in the band structure in the absence of the external field , the magnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the external field is enhanced by the small field , which results from the disappearance of the insulating gap due to the external field . on the other hand , in the semi - metallic case , the realization of anomalous phase diagrams strongly depends on the structure of density of states close to the fermi level and the temperature region .",
    "we consider the effects of coulomb interaction only by using rpa .",
    "this method is one of the mean - field approximations and neglects the effect of quantum fluctuations which may be particularly important in the vicinity of the quantum critical points .",
    "@xcite therefore , if quantum fluctuations are taken into account by employing more accurate methods , such as the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximation , the phase boundary may quantitatively shift to the low temperature region .",
    "let us consider the effect of the orbital degeneracy .",
    "heavy fermion compounds have the degeneracy of @xmath2 orbitals of rare earth and actinide ions . we consider the simplest model with a lower band and an upper band , where the effect of degeneracy of each band is not considered . if one is single band and the others have degeneracy , the perfect nesting condition is absent even at zero field .",
    "however , in the present study , we consider low - carrier two - band models with a small overlap and a gap between two bands , where the electron and hole surfaces become very small spheres .",
    "therefore , when the fermi spheres become obscure at finite temperature region , the nesting vector does not change even if the orbital degeneracy is considered .",
    "the structure of dos close to fermi level becomes most essential to the anomalous phase diagram .",
    "when the hole doping is also introduced , the nesting condition becomes worse .",
    "however , as far as the concentration does not conspicuously affect the number of the states near the fermi level , the doping effect is irrelevant at finite temperature region in this study .",
    "thus , we conclude that the orbital degeneracy does not change the result presented here .",
