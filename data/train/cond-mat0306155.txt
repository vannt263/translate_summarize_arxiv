    "superconductivity in the cubic skutterudite pros@xmath0sb@xmath1 ( pos ) has received a great interest in recent years since it has two superconducting phases  @xcite . the specific heat results  @xcite show jumps at @xmath2 1.82k and @xmath3 1.75 k. nowadays such two superconducting phases are well known in a spin - triplet superconductor upt@xmath4 and a superfluid @xmath5he .",
    "a nqr experiment shows the absence of the coherence peak , which suggests that pos is an unconventional superconductor  @xcite .",
    "a thermal conductivity experiment indicates 6 point nodes at ( 1,0,0 ) direction and directions equivalent to ( 1,0,0 ) for the high temperature phase ( h - phase )  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism and the symmetry of pairing have been discussed in several theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "pos should be distinguished from the other unconventional superconductors , in that it has a non - magnetic ground state of the localized @xmath6-electrons in the crystalline electric field .",
    "the origin of heavy fermion behavior in this compound has been discussed in terms of the interaction of the electric quadrupole moments of pr@xmath7 with the conduction electrons , rather than local magnetic moments as in the other heavy fermion superconductors .",
    "therefore the relation between the superconductivity and the orbital fluctuation of @xmath6-electron state has aroused great interest ; pos is a candidate for the first superconductor mediated neither by electron - phonon nor magnetic interactions .",
    "hence it is of the utmost importance to determine the symmetry of the superconducting gap . at present , however , the pairing symmetry of pos is still unclear .",
    "this is simply because we lack both experimental data and theoretical analysis enough to address the pairing symmetry .",
    "so far , a possibility of anisotropic @xmath8 wave symmetries has been discussed for spin - singlet cooper pairs . in the low - temperature phase ( l - phase ) , an additional symmetry breaking decreases the number of point nodes to 4 or 2  @xcite .",
    "the spin - triplet superconductivity still has a possibility  @xcite , where the pairing interaction is mediated by the quadrupolar fluctuations .",
    "the double transition is more easily constructed in spin - triplet pairing with degeneracy due to the time - reversal symmetry than the spin - singlet pairing  @xcite . in a theory",
    "@xcite , unitary and nonunitary spin - triplet states are proposed for h- and l - phase , respectively .",
    "generally speaking , the tunneling spectra are expected to reflect the bulk density of states ( dos ) of superconductors .",
    "this is true for isotropic @xmath8 wave superconductors . in unconventional superconductors , however ,",
    "the tunneling spectra often differ from the bulk dos .",
    "a zero - bias conductance peak ( zbcp ) of high-@xmath9 materials is an important example  @xcite .",
    "the interference effect of a quasiparticle enables the zero - energy andreev bound states on the fermi energy at surfaces of @xmath10 wave superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the formation of the zero - energy states ( zes ) is a universal phenomenon expected in unconventional superconductors  @xcite , and affects the low - temperature behavior of charge transport properties  @xcite and the josephson current  @xcite .",
    "when the direction of the electric current deviates from the @xmath11 axis of high-@xmath9 superconductors , a large conductance peak is observed around the zero - bias , which reflects the dos of such surface states .",
    "when the current is parallel to the @xmath11 axis , on the other hand , the conductance shape is close to that of the bulk dos in high-@xmath9 superconductors .",
    "thus the tunneling spectra are essentially anisotropic in unconventional superconductors , which means that it is possible to extract useful information of the pairing symmetry from tunneling spectra .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the differential conductance in normal - metal / insulator / pos junctions for several pair potentials proposed in recent studies .",

    "thus pos may be the spin - triplet superconductors if the sub gap conductance shows complicated peak structures in experiments .",
    "the argument , however , is still a guess based on the calculated results . this is because it may be possible to consider another pair potentials with 6 point nodes .    in this paper",
    ", we do not consider the self - consistency of the pair potential near the junction interface .",
    "it is empirically known that the depletion of the pair potential modifies the conductance structure around @xmath64 or maximum of @xmath97 .",
    "our conclusions remain unchanged even in the self - consistent pair potential unless the self - consistency does not change the symmetry of the pair potential and/or the number of components in @xmath10 vectors .",
    "we have discussed the differential conductance in normal - metal / insulator / pos junctions based on the bogoliubov - de gennes equation . for spin - singlet pairing , the conductance is calculated for three candidates of pair potentials in the anisotropic @xmath8 wave symmetry .",
    "the results show that the conductance spectra depend strongly on the relation between the direction of currents and that of nodes .",
    "we found that the conductance vanishes in the limit of the zero - bias and there is no anomalous behavior around the zero - bias for these candidates .",
    "the conductance for @xmath65 wave symmetry in l - phase and that for @xmath10 wave symmetry in h - phase are also demonstrated . in the case of spin - triplet superconductivity , we discuss the conductance for six candidates of pair potentials in h - phase and two candidates in l - phase .",
    "the results show peak structures in the sub gap conductance for all candidates .",
    "the broken - time reversal symmetry states , the zero - energy states and @xmath10 vectors with multi components arise these peak structures .",
    "pos may be a spin - triplet superconductor if the peak structures in the sub gap conductance is observed in future experiments .",
    "in particular , the presence or the absence of the zbcp is an important information to address the pairing symmetry .",
    "thus experiments of the tunneling spectra are desired  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the magneto tunneling spectroscopy is a useful tool to know details of internal structures of pair potentials  @xcite .",
    "the tunnel spectra through a ferromagnetic tip  @xcite reflect the spin configuration of cooper pairs in the case of the spin - triplet superconductors . even in the spin - singlet superconductors ,",
    "the absence of the time - reversal symmetry in ferromagnets affects the interference effects of a quasiparticle and modifies the tunneling spectra . at present , however , the investigations in this direction are limited in the @xmath10 wave high-@xmath9 superconductors .",
    "the magneto tunneling spectroscopy in another unconventional superconductors is a future problem .    in this paper",
    ", we assumed the clean ballistic junctions .",
    "it is known impurity scatterings in normal metals induce the proximity effect  @xcite .",
    "the proximity effect of unconventional superconductors with point nodes is also a open question .",
