    "since charles messier registered the first planetary nebulae ( dumbell nebula in vulpecula ) on july 12 , 1764 until the present time , over one thousand of these beautiful objects were found in our galaxy and much more in nearby galaxies .",
    "it is well known that pne have different shapes but , in most cases , the projection of a nebula onto the sky has a defined extension axis . besides , the study of the orientation of many kind of phenomena such as supernova remnants ( gaensler 1998 ) , orbits of binary systems ( brazhnikova et al . 1975 ) , rotation of individual stars ( hensberge et al .",
    "1979 ) , has been of broad astrophysical interest .",
    "this sort of study provides information about formation , evolution and death of the stars .",
    "however , the orientation of the projected major axis of the pne was rarely studied and the results that were found are still contradictory .    for instance , shain ( 1956 ) and gurzadyan ( 1958 ) made the pioneering works about the orientation of pne .",
    "they worked with very small samples from the curtis catalogue ( 1917 ) and their conclusions were contradictory .",
    "shain found that the angle between the semi - major axis of pne and the galactic equator was small for objects with low latitudes . on the other hand gurzadyan",
    "did not found any correlation and concluded that the magnetic field could not be influencing the shape of pne . at the present time both papers only have a historical character . the first works to determine spatial orientations of pne with a significant number of objects were those of grinin & zvereva ( 1968 ) , and melnick & harwitt ( 1974 ) .",
    "these works were more complete than early ones and both papers concluded that pne are aligned with the plane .",
    "the hypothesis explaining these non - random orientations were based in the effect of the ambient magnetic field and interactions with the interstellar medium .",
    "the works of phillips ( 1997 ) and corradi , aznar & mampaso ( 1998 ; hereafter cam98 ) are the most recent and contradictory papers about global pne orientations . in both cases , the images examined had high quality and the determination of pa have small errors , but they did not study the orientation of pne over a specific region of the sky .",
    "the sample of phillips was culled from a variety of published images complemented with broad band survey plates , whereas the sample of corradi and coworkers comes mainly from three different narrow band surveys .",
    "in this paper we visit this topic and make a careful study with new geometrical considerations .",
    "the characterization of any found correlation in a certain region of the sky would help to disentangle the role of the galactic magnetic field in determining the morphologies of these sources .",
    "alternatively , it could be found that the motion of pne through the interstellar medium leads to some compression of their shells , and result in significant correlations between the apparent outflow axes .",
    "the unrestricted total sample was extracted from 3 different sources : digitized sky survey version 2 , dss2 ( red broad band ) ; the macquarie@xmath1strasbourg @xmath2 planetary nebulae catalog , ( mash ; @xmath2 narrow band ) ; and hst archival imagery ( filters f502n and f656n ) .",
    "after the starting criteria described in section 2 , the initial number of pne studied in this work resulted in 868 , significantly larger than in previous studies .",
    "the analysis is performed through sections 3 to 5 , the results are presented and discussed in sections 6 and 7 .",
    "the sample was extracted from the catalogue of galactic planetary nebulae updated version 2000 ( kohoutek 2001 ; hereafter cgpn2000 ) that includes 1510 true pne and the mash survey ( parker et al . 2006 ) with 903 objects , 578 of them are classified as true pn .",
    "there is virtually no overlap between the cgpn2000 and the mash catalogs , therefore this last one provided one third of the final sample of truly elongated pne .",
    "we included a special subsample of the cgpn2000 which is formed by those objects imaged by the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "the selection criteria employed to obtain our final sample were :    1 .",
    "objects classified as true pn .",
    "angular size larger than 10@xmath3 .",
    "the experience shows that , in general , this limit yields spatial resolution sufficient to determine the orientation of the major axis .",
    "exception in the angular size criterium was made for those objects imaged by the hst .",
    "3 .   @xmath4 , to avoid information degradation by projection effects over high latitudes objects .",
    "4 .   in case of the mash survey we only included pne which at least have one confirmation spectrum .",
    "5 .   objects clearly visible in the dss2 plates ( surface brightness @xmath5 17 mag / arcmin@xmath6 ) , this restriction criterium was applied for all the surveys contributing to the sample .",
    "elongated shape ( pne with morphology type r were rejected ) .    by elongated shape pne we mean bipolar nebulae or those which show two lobes defining unambiguously the direction of their polar outflows , as well as e nebulae with an appreciable ellipticity . at the cases where the object is near to the dss resolution we estimate an empirical limit of major to minor axis length ratio 1.2:1 , as determined from those objects which were in the visual limit of acceptance .    in order to extend our sample",
    "we included pne with angular size between 4@xmath3 and 10@xmath3 inclusively , that had been observed by hst .",
    "such pne , 42 in total number and 27 truly elongated , belong to some of our 4 regions . due to the variety of filters",
    "the chosen criterium here was to use the images taken through the f656n or f502n filters whenever possible . to complete the sample we also included those pne measured by cam98 that we could not measure from the dss2 plates .",
    "after a careful examination of more than 868 pne in the initial list ( obtained after criteria 1 , 2 and 3 ) , we arrived to the final sample that contains 444 truly elongated pne distributed in four regions , 174 belonging to the mash sample .",
    "the remaining objects were planetaries with apparent circular shape , low surface brightness or very peculiar morphology .",
    "we measured the position angles ( pa ) of the projected major axis over the sky , for all the pne of the final sample .",
    "pa are measured following the usual convention : from the north towards the east .",
    "these angles are measured within the equatorial coordinates system so we call them epa .",
    "the directions of the elongated axis were estimated visually by fixing the line that better represents the long symmetry axis of the pn . the angle that this line forms with the north was the epa . for bipolar structures",
    "the epa was measured with respect to the direction of the outflow of the objects .",
    "the uncertainties of epa are estimated following the criterium of cam98 : all measurements were repeated independently by both authors .",
    "the largest difference between both measurements was 8@xmath7 .",
    "the measuring criteria are exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fotito1 ] .    in spite of the fact that all previous works determined the epa visually , we tried to obtain those angles through an automated way , but the problem was that this sort of automated algorithms are still not powerful enough to deal with low s / n and overcrowded fields with high galactic background .",
    "pne are usually located in highly populated milky way fields and in many cases do not show structure complete at the same surface brightness .",
    "this patchy structure and the star images make the software approach still difficult .",
    "an example of a more refined criterion of epa measurement can be derived from an attentive comparison between the fig .",
    "[ fotito1]c and [ fotito1]d . in spite of the fact that both objects present the characteristic belt of bipolar planetary nebulae , in the case of ngc5189 the structures that appear in both sides of the apparent belt do not have hemispherical appearance as the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fotito1]d .",
    "the orientation marked in the figure takes into account that the brilliant knot at the e of the main body s external part , is of totally nebular appearance when the original image is inspected .",
    "considering that the criterion for determination is based mainly on the external morphology , the major axis of the pn is well determined .",
    "this complex object represents a limit case where the measured epa could show the largest scatter when employing other criteria .",
    "but as we show in section 7 , our epa values do not show significant deviations from the values obtained by cam98 for objects present in both samples .",
    "the epas are measured relative to the equatorial coordinates system . in order to transform this position angle to the galactic system we need to compute the angle @xmath8 , which is subtended at the position of each object by the direction of the equatorial north and the galactic north .    @xmath9    where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are",
    "the equatorial coordinates of the galactic north pole , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the equatorial right ascension and galactic latitude coordinates respectively ( both coordinates were extracted from cgpn2000 ) . then the galactic position angle ( gpa )",
    "is defined as the position angle of the major axis of the apparent nebular elongation , measured from the direction of the galactic north towards the east ( table  4 ) .",
    "@xmath14    we used the same convention that phillips ( 1997 ) used for measuring the epas , in the interval @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the values are reported and used here in the same range , but some authors ( e.g. cam98 ) report them to the interval @xmath16 $ ] assuming a priori a symmetric problem , in the sense that a preferred orientation of the pne elongations very nearly to the galactic equator will be easier to detect .",
    "the problem with this treatment of the epa is that it would blur any other preferred orientation that is not very near to the galactic equator ( fig .",
    "[ fotito2 ] ) .",
    "the orientations for individual planetary nebulae is presented in table  4 , which is also available on request to the authors .",
    "one difference with previous studies is that , in order to avoid information degradation by projection effects , we did not include in our study objects with @xmath17 .",
    "the number of objects far from the galactic plane is not statistically significant , although the projection effect with respect to the galactic equatorial plane should be considered in any future larger sample to be analyzed . to study the orientation of the sample , we selected four angular sectors : those defined by the galactic center and anti - center , and the perpendicular directions ( table  1 ) .",
    "the regions were defined in angular range in such a way that there was enough number of objects to do a statistical analysis in at least the region towards the galactic center ( 262 objects ) .",
    "but they should not be so large in angular extent that any absolute orientation respect to the galactic system would be deleted by the superposition of different projections to the observer .",
    "it must be taken into account , that the projection effects at the position of the observer would mask the effect of some preferred orientations if the data are compiled and analyzed as a whole set without any regard to the position respect to the observer and the galactic center .",
    "all the previous works have treated the data as a whole set , and we show that in this way important information could have been or might be overlooked in the future .",
    "the region that shows a distribution of gpa with some possible non - random characteristics is the region with center towards the galactic center . in the other regions ,",
    "the low number of objects precludes detection of any clear trend , although we can rule out any strong correlation that involves the majority of the pne in the sample .",
    "the distribution of gpa of the regions are presented in fig .",
    "[ fotito3 ] .",
    "if the distribution of the * n * objects of the sample in each sector were random , with the same probability of finding an elongated object with its axis towards any pa , when * j * angular boxes are defined in the range @xmath15 $ ] , it could be expected an average population of * n / j * objects per bin .",
    "the frequency of all the possible values would be an angular positions distribution , with a dispersion @xmath18 . in table  2",
    "we show the expected average per angular bin and the dispersion for each region , and the number of peaks observed above @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the barycenters calculated for each peak , determined within a window of @xmath21 , are summarized in table  2 .",
    "a thorough test can be performed by applying a simple binomial test , as proposed by siegel ( 1956 ) and applied by hutsemkers ( 1998 ) .",
    "it gives the probability @xmath22 that a random distribution has @xmath23 angles ( of a set of @xmath24 objects ) in the interval @xmath25 $ ] . in our case",
    "@xmath26 is the peak barycenter .",
    "such probability is defined as :    @xmath27    table  3 shows the probability of randomness for each observed peak using @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( note that when @xmath28 the probability that the right peak of region i is random , is only @xmath30 ) . in region i , the distribution has two peaks with a separation of @xmath31 ( or @xmath0 in the opposite sense ) in the directions defined by the peaks . _",
    "it is important to remark that the separate subsamples of pne from dss2 , cam98 and mash each one shows at the region i , an apparent peak in @xmath32 .",
    "_    following the clue provided by some similarity of the results for regions iii and iv , we added the distributions found for regions i and ii ( fig .  [ fotito4]a ) and for regions iii and iv ( fig .",
    "[ fotito4]b ) .",
    "the two distributions in fig .",
    "[ fotito4]b show right peak over @xmath33 and left peak over @xmath34 , in both cases with a peak separation of @xmath35 . here",
    "the separation is considered as the minimum angular distance between both peaks .",
    "moreover as both distributions are in opposite sides of the sky , is natural to measure the separation in opposite sense .",
    "it should be noted that the position angles are being measured with the nesw convention , without any regard to the absolute orientation of the objects respect to the observer . then if some absolute orientation would be common to most of the objects and considering that the observer is in the center of the sky band over which the objects appear projected , the sense of measuring of the position angles in opposite regions ( e.g. i and ii ) should be inverted by making * 180 - gpa * in the opposite regions . coincidentally",
    ", the transformation of the data in regions iii+iv ( fig .  [ fotito4]b ) gives a distribution resembling that of regions i+ii : a narrow main peak and a possible secondary one @xmath35 before .",
    "we also carried out the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test to have an alternative evaluation of the randomness of the observed distribution .",
    "this requires the calculation of @xmath36 : the absolute value of the maximum deviation between the observed ( @xmath37 with @xmath38 points ) and theoretical ( @xmath39 with @xmath40 points ) cumulative distribution function ( press et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the significance can be written as the following sum :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 that is the effective number of data points of the samples .",
    "this test gave us a probability , that our data derived from a random distribution , of 63% for region i , 53% for region ii , 93% for region iii and 28% for region iv .",
    "as an alternative we tried to perform a variation of k - s test : the kuiper ( k - p ) test which is more sensible than k - s test in some kind of circular distributions .    to perform this test we have to calculate @xmath44 , which is the sum of the maximum distance of @xmath37 above and below @xmath39 . a good approximation for the significance",
    "is :    @xmath45    where @xmath46    the result that we obtained with k - p test for our region i ( with the strongest signal ) is @xmath47 , which seems to be not a convincing one .",
    "these tests could not be fully applicable to our kind of data : caution should be taken when applying all varieties of k - s test , because they lack the ability to discriminate some kind of distributions .",
    "for example , we can consider a probability distribution showing a narrow hole within which the randomness probability falls to zero .",
    "the existence of even one data point within the hole would rule out such distribution ( because of its cumulative nature , press et al .",
    "1992 ) , the k - s test would require many data points in the narrow hole before signaling a discrepancy .    to probe this kind of behavior",
    ", we generated a random distribution of 72 gpa and after that we added 10 gpa values distributed in the first bin ( fig .",
    "[ fotito5 ] ) .",
    "this distribution has an average of 9.1 gpa per bin and a dispersion of @xmath48 . in this way",
    ", the first bin shows a signal over @xmath49 .",
    "now if we apply both tests to this artificial sample we obtain the next probabilities , that this data follow a random distribution : @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( fig .",
    "[ fotito6 ] ) .",
    "we have verified that there is no way to generate 67 cases and not even 17 cases of a @xmath49 peak in 100 fully random samples .",
    "therefore we conclude that although k - s and k - p tests are well suited to analyze non random global trends in samples , they are strongly insensitive to the presence of a local non - random feature .",
    "we studied the orientation of all pne of our sample ( without separating it in regions ) and we do not see a clear preferential orientation of long axis of pn respect to the galactic plane . this distribution of gpa is similar to that observed by cam98 .",
    "we tried to double check our results by applying our analysis to the data published by cam98 , performing a suitable analysis to take over the ambiguity of the position angles ( assigned to the range @xmath52 $ ] ) .",
    "more precisely , the sample of cam98 includes 208 objects ( counting the object m2 - 55 in only one list ) ; 69 of them are in both samples ( the object that cam98 put in the list of ellipticals as pc 4 , is in fact pb 4 ) ; 85 are outside our four regions ; 50 were not measured because they are too small ; have strange morphology or circular appearance ; and 4 objects are not true pn ( bl cru , crl 2688 , m 1 - 91 , m 1 - 92 ) .",
    "75@xmath53 of the 69 objects that are in both samples , have their gpa in good agreement ( @xmath54 ) with our measurement .",
    "moreover , the distribution of gpa from those objects from cam98 whose coordinates are in region i , shows a clear peak over 3 @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "[ fotito7 ] , 48 objects ) , whose barycenter is in @xmath56 , a position similar , within the uncertainties , to the main peak in our fig .",
    "[ fotito3 ] .",
    "this feature could not be detected by cam98 due to the way they calculated the final angles to plot .",
    "the differences could be mainly caused by the fact that they employed deep narrow - band images , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fotito8 ] .",
    "this figure shows an example of the pn th2-a dss image through r broad - band filter and 1.5 resolution .",
    "the epa was measured following the ellipsoid apparent major axis . for comparison ,",
    "[ fotito8]-right shows the same object imaged with gmos at gemini - s 8 m telescope , through a [ oiii]@xmath575007 filter and with 0.7 seeing ( from daz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the presence of faint blue emission knots can change the major axis determination from the ellipsoid maximum diameter to an approximately perpendicular angle .",
    "therefore it can be expected that the measured geometrical properties of the objects change as distinct ionization layers are imaged through different filters , more precisely , the left peak ( e.g. we 1 - 4 ) in our broad band study could be arose in the measuring of the pn equatorial belt apparent axis instead of the faint external envelope . this should not occur in the deep narrow band images of the cam98 sample and could explain the absence of the second peak in that sample .",
    "nevertheless , the agreement between the gpa measurements in both samples is very good and the presence of the second peak can just be ascribed to the ability to detect the outer fainter details in the deep narrow band images , which are usually perpendicular to the bright equatorial belt structures more easily detected in the dss imagery .",
    "an interesting test to perform is to check if the distribution of gpa in the four regions has a distance modulation and consider objects statistically far and close . as a first order approach we separated objects in each region by its angular size : an angular diameter of 35@xmath3 divided the sample in two halves , objects with large angular size were considered closer than the ones with small angular size . assuming an average radius of 0.1pc the separating distance is 1.2kpc .",
    "the results that we obtained in the four regions show that the distribution of gpa for larger pne has the same shape than the smaller pne .",
    "so there is not evidence about a distance effect .",
    "following the same open minded search we tried to relate the pa of the long axis of pne with respect to the gould belt , the plane defined by nearby stars of young population , mainly o and b stars ( cameron et al . 1994 ) .",
    "the result found shows a noisy distribution of pa .",
    "besides , several studies have related bipolar pne with binary progenitors ( bond & livio 1990 ) but the antecedents about the orientations of the orbits of binary stars do not provide any comparable result .",
    "notwithstanding it must be remarked that a thorough analysis should be made , keeping in mind the new geometric considerations carried out in this work .",
    "we could also consider the case in which only the disk population of the pne towards the galactic center would show a preferred orientation .",
    "first , we can test the robustness of the result against the possibility of significant contamination of the pne sample toward the galactic center caused by a random orientation of bulge pne . if the bulge pne contamination were as high as 50% , then more than half of the disk pne would need to have a preferred orientation near to the galactic plane , to be detected and identified in the epa distribution .",
    "moreover , it would be necessary to disentangle the bulge objects by their radial velocities in order to verify if the preferred orientation for the disk pne is actually much larger than the one reported here .",
    "regarding the physical causes , melnick & harwitt ( 1974 ) mentioned the compression of the pne shells resulting from motion through the ism is seldom observed , remarking that the time scale of the pn expansion ( @xmath58years ) would be large enough to show systematic off - centering of the progenitor stars , which heretofore has been detected in a few lopsided objects ( borkowski , sarazin & soker 1990 ) and could be a dominant factor at the very faintest outer envelopes where the nebular density falls below a critical limit of n@xmath59@xmath60 . undoubtedly the most considered hypothesis has been that the pne could eventually expand more in the direction of the ambient or galactic magnetic field field force lines , which are approximately deployed along the milky way plane ( e.g. phillips 1997 ) .",
    "the typical energy density of the interstellar magnetic field is lower than @xmath61erg@xmath60 , whereas the energy density ( thermal , excitation and ionization ) is usually larger than @xmath62erg@xmath60 , consequently a correlation with any observable quantity related with galactic magnetic fields ( diaz & weidmann 2008 , in preparation ) would imply that this are at least one or two orders of magnitude higher in some regions towards the galactic center .",
    "the data on pa of planetary nebulae show that global preferred orientations are not dominant , even considering a new approach that takes into account the three - dimensional problem .",
    "besides the conclusions hold by the results , we presented here some important geometrical and analytical considerations that have been overlooked by the previous works on the subject .",
    "it is worth to mention that there could be a preferred orientation of some pne in the zones near to the galactic center , and the corresponding distribution of galactic position angles could have a peak not exactly aligned with the milky way plane : the pne towards the galactic center have an orientation distribution with a possible narrow peak near to the galactic plane ( @xmath32 ) , with a randomness probability as small as @xmath63 .",
    "we remark that we did not exclude any object within the selection criteria and galactic coordinates in the range @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and no special attention was given to the possibility that some objects may belong to the galactic bulge population and the consequences over the detected trend are unknown beyond the qualitative discussion of the previous section .",
    "furthermore a larger and deeper galactic center sample , optimally observed at nir wavelengths , should be analyzed in order to thoroughly assess the reality of this preferred orientation .",
    "the possible implications are of broad astrophysical interest and we hope that they stimulate more detailed studies , in particular , larger samples of galactic pne towards the galactic center should be studied as soon as they become available .",

    "<S> we analyze the spatial orientation of a homogenous sample of 440 elongated planetary nebulae ( pne ) in order to determine the orientation of their apparent major axis respect to the milky way plane . </S>",
    "<S> we present some important geometrical and statistical considerations that have been overlooked by the previous works on the subject . </S>",
    "<S> the global distribution of galactic position angles ( gpa ) of pne is quantitatively not very different from a random distribution of orientations in the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we find that there is at least one region on the sky , toward the galactic center , where a weak correlation may exist between the orientation of the major axis of some pne and the galactic equator , with an excess of axes with gpa@xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we confirm that `` extrinsic '' phenomena ( i.e. , global galactic magnetic fields , shell compression from motion relative to the interstellar medium ) do not determine the morphology of pne on most of the sky , with a possible exception towards the galactic center . </S>"
