    "the quantum cramr - rao bound provides the proper theoretical framework for analyzing energy / time - like uncertainty relations  @xcite by setting limits on the precision attainable when estimating the parameters governing the dynamics of a physical system .",
    "its application has profound consequences in quantum metrology  @xcite , where it helps in identifying which resources ( e.g. , entanglement and squeezing ) are useful to reach higher accuracy levels , and which are the proper procedures one needs to adopt to fully exploit them .",
    "for instance , in the absence of external noise , the quantum cramr - rao bound predicts  @xcite that in the process of estimating a relative phase , the use of entanglement between sequences of @xmath1 independent probing systems allows one to gain a @xmath2 improvement in precision ( heisenberg limit ) over those procedures which , under the same experimental settings , adopt instead separable probes ( standard quantum limit , or shot - noise limit in optical interferometry ) .",
    "more subtle is to establish the optimal performances in presence of external disturbances .",
    "many discouraging results attest the fragility of entanglement which , in a noisy environment , limits any precision improvement at most to a constant factor independent of @xmath1  @xcite , or to a super - classical precision scaling , @xmath3 , achieved when the perturbation involves a preferential direction perpendicular to the unitary evolution governed by the parameter to be estimated  @xcite . yet an exhaustive answer would require a systematic method for taking into account the presence of disturbance in the system . the main obstacle is represented by the fact that the very fundamental tool needed to evaluate the quantum cramr - rao inequality , _ i.e. _ , the quantum fisher information ( qfi )  @xcite , apart from very simple cases , usually happens to be computationally cumbersome , especially for high dimensional systems .",
    "recently , escher _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a strategy to circumvent this difficulty by introducing an upper bound to the qfi , which relies on the choice of a kraus representation of the noisy evolution based on physical considerations . in this way",
    ", it was possible to propose a realistic example of optical lossy interferometry where the heisenberg limit can be attained by properly tuning the number of input resources according to the noise level  @xcite . a generalization of the latter analysis for the single parameter estimation to the case of lossy optical waveform reconstruction has been recently proposed  @xcite . notwithstanding these bright techniques , a general prescription for computing the qfi of a generic dynamical process is still missing .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of closed quantum systems and study the effects of a unitary disturbance on the estimation of a dynamical parameter @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , we add a term to the generator of the dynamical evolution of the system to model the action of an external force that opposes the formation of the parametric trajectories governed by @xmath0 , and determine a compact analytical expression for the associated qfi . starting from this result ,",
    "we report several important facts .",
    "first of all , while for non optimal choices of model settings it is possible that the disturbance will improve the accuracy of the estimation procedure , we prove a _ no - go theorem _ which formalizes the rather intuitive fact that the _ best _ performances are always reached when no disturbance is present in the system .",
    "most importantly we also notice that enhancing the level of a hamiltonian disturbance which is already affecting the system does _ not _ necessarily yield a worse _ optimal _ estimation strategy and can reveal itself helpful in determining the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this is a rather counterintuitive finding which can be interpreted as the emergence of _ dithering _",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "this technique is then reframed in the more general context of multiparametric estimation ( sec .  [ sec : qet_multip ] ) . in sec .",
