    "<S> we analyze the surface morphology of metals after plastic deformation over a range of scales from 10 nm to 2 mm , using a combination of atomic force microscopy and scanning white - light interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that an initially smooth surface during deformation develops self - affine roughness over almost four orders of magnitude in scale . </S>",
    "<S> the hurst exponent @xmath0 of one - dimensional surface profiles is initially found to decrease with increasing strain and then stabilizes at @xmath1 . by analyzing their statistical properties </S>",
    "<S> we show that the one - dimensional surface profiles can be mathematically modelled as graphs of a fractional brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> our findings can be understood in terms of a fractal distribution of plastic strain within the deformed samples .    according to the traditional paradigm implicit in continuum models of plasticity , plastic deformation under homogeneous loads and in the absence of so - called plastic instabilities </S>",
    "<S> is expected to proceed in a smooth and spatially homogeneous manner . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuations , if any , are supposed to average out above the scale of a `` representative volume element '' which is tacitly assumed to be small in comparison with macroscopic dimensions ( or , indeed , in comparison with the scale of any problem to which continuum modelling is applied ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently for crystalline systems deforming by dislocation glide this paradigm has been challenged both from the theoretical and experimental side @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> weiss et . </S>",
    "<S> al . demonstrated that dislocation glide in single - glide oriented ice single crystals proceeds in a temporally intermittent manner , i.e. , plastic flow is characterized by a sequence of large `` deformation bursts '' @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic emission due to these bursts was monitored and it was demonstrated that there is no characteristic burst magnitude . instead the energy releases were found to obey a scale - free power - law distribution over more than six orders of magnitude in energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of dislocation dynamics in single - glide single crystals showed qualitatively similar behavior @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these findings were interpreted as dynamical critical phenomena in a slowly driven non - equilibrium system @xcite , and it has been argued that the dislocation system in a plastically deforming crystal is always close to a critical point ( `` yielding transition '' , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> temporal intermittency of plastic flow goes along with spatial heterogeneity . </S>",
    "<S> this has been long known to metallurgists who observed pronounced surface traces ( `` slip lines '' ) resulting from the collective motion of many dislocations . by monitoring the evolution of surface </S>",
    "<S> features it is therefore possible to study collective behavior in plastic flow . </S>",
    "<S> however , most investigations ( for an overview , see @xcite ) have focused on the evolution of single slip lines or slip line bundles , i.e. , the motion of isolated dislocation groups . </S>",
    "<S> long - range correlations within the slip pattern have only occasionally been studied . </S>",
    "<S> konstantinidis and aifantis @xcite used a wavelet transform to investigate the slip pattern of a fe@xmath2al single crystal on multiple scales between 0.1 and 50 micrometers but did not quantitatively analyze their data in view of scale - invariant behavior . </S>",
    "<S> kleiser and bocek @xcite report a self - similar pattern of slip lines in cu single crystals on scales between 0.06 and 2 micrometers and determine a fractal dimension @xmath3 for the set of intersection points between the slip lines and a line normal to the slip direction .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , weiss and marsan @xcite investigated the three - dimensional patterning of slip on macroscopic scales . by recording acoustic emission with multiple transducers and using spatial triangulation , they determined the 3d distribution of slip bursts in the volume of an ice single crystal . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation demonstrated that the slip burst pattern on macroscopic scales ( 0.6 mm to 10 mm ) exhibits features of a fractal set with correlation dimension @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the limited spatial resolution of the technique no information about the slip distribution on smaller scales could be obtained .    in the present study </S>",
    "<S> we pursue a slightly different approach for assessing spatial correlations in plastic deformation from the nanoscopic to the macroscopic scale . instead of directly studying the distribution of plastic strain in the bulk or on the surface of the sample , </S>",
    "<S> we monitor the evolution of the surface profile . </S>",
    "<S> provided that the initial surface is sufficiently smooth , the evolution of a one - dimensional profile can be directly related to the plastic distortion at the surface : if we define a local coordinate system such that the @xmath5 direction corresponds to the direction of the profile and the @xmath6 direction to the surface normal , then the derivative @xmath7 of the profile @xmath8 equals the component @xmath9 of the plastic distortion tensor . </S>",
    "<S> long - range correlations in the plastic strain pattern can be detected since they give rise to characteristic modifications of the surface morphology - more specifically speaking , power - law correlations in the spatial distribution of plastic strain lead to the emergence of self - affine surface profiles with a hurst exponent @xmath10 as will be discussed below .    a self - affine profile @xmath8 is characterized by the property that the statistical properties of the profile remain unchanged under the scaling transformation @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the roughness exponent or hurst exponent @xmath0 can be related to a fractal dimension @xmath12 ( `` box dimension '' ) of the profile through @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> self - affine behavior is abundant in natural surfaces , a most prominent example in materials physics are fracture surfaces whose large - scale roughness can be characterized by a universal ( material - independent ) exponent @xmath14 @xcite . in the present letter we report for the first time an analysis of the surface structure of plastically deformed metal samples in terms of self - affine properties . </S>",
    "<S> we applied a combination of atomic force microscopy ( afm ) and scanning white - light interferometry ( swli ) to quantitatively characterize the surface morphology over a range of scales between 10 nm and 2 mm . </S>",
    "<S> polycrystalline copper samples of 99.9 % nominal purity and an average grain size of 40 @xmath15 m were electropolished to a typical rms roughness of 44 nm as determined by swli over a surface area of @xmath16 m @xmath17 m . </S>",
    "<S> two complementary methods were used for surface imaging : ( i ) afm scans ( 512 @xmath18 512 pixels ) were taken over areas of @xmath19 m @xmath20 m and @xmath21 m @xmath22 m using a picospm ( molecular imaging ) at the constant deflection mode with a medium range scanner and a cantilever ( mikromasch , ultrasharp ) with a nominal spring constant of 1.75 n / m and tip curvature radius  10 nm ; the rms vertical noise amplitude was less than 0.05 nm ; ( ii ) swli ( new view 100 , zygo ) scans were performed over areas of @xmath23 m @xmath24 m with a lateral resolution of  0.6 @xmath15 m and a vertical resolution of  0.5 nm . from the scans , typically 4 - 5 surface profiles were taken in the direction of the specimen axis and 2 - 3 profiles normal to that direction .    after characterizing the initial surface , </S>",
    "<S> the samples were deformed in tension on a standard tensile - testing machine ( instron series 3360 ) . </S>",
    "<S> testing was done at room temperature with an imposed strain rate @xmath25 s@xmath26 . at total ( engineering ) </S>",
    "<S> strains @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( see figure [ stressstrain ] ) , the sample was unloaded and afm and swli scans were taken in a similar manner as before deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the sequence of surface morphology investigations was ended at the onset of macroscopic deformation localization ( necking ) .    </S>",
    "<S> typical surface profiles are shown in figure [ profiles ] representing a `` long '' afm profile obtained from a @xmath19 m @xmath29 m scan together with a swli profile . to investigate a possible self - affine structure , mean height differences @xmath30 within the profile . </S>",
    "<S> self - affine behavior implies that @xmath31 hence , double - logarithmic plots of @xmath32 vs. @xmath33 should exhibit a linear scaling regime with slope @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> such roughness plots are shown in figure [ roughness ] . </S>",
    "<S> typical plots exhibit linear scaling regimes extending between 0.05 and 5 @xmath15 m for the afm and between 0.5 and 100 @xmath15 m for the swli profiles . </S>",
    "<S> hurst exponents deduced from the slope of the scaling regimes are similar for afm and swli profiles , and also the absolute values of @xmath32 are similar across the region of overlap of the roughness plots . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we observe continuous scaling over almost four orders of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> surface profiles @xmath34 taken in the direction normal to the tensile axis exhibit scaling with similar exponents , although the length of the self - affine scaling regimes is reduced .    </S>",
    "<S> roughness plots obtained from the `` short '' afm profiles deduced from @xmath35 m @xmath22 m scans show a crossover to a strain - independent apparent hurst exponent @xmath36 below 50 - 100 nm .    </S>",
    "<S> hurst exponents @xmath0 and fractal dimensions @xmath13 determined from the roughness plots are compiled in figure [ dimension ] . </S>",
    "<S> the error bars reflect the scatter of exponents obtained from different profiles taken at the same strain . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the exponents initially decrease with increasing strain and then stabilize above @xmath37 at a value of @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the initial value of @xmath38 does not reflect any self - affine surface roughness but simply stems from large - scale gradients on an almost smooth surface . </S>",
    "<S> the same is true for the steepening of roughness plots obtained from the `` short '' afm profiles on very small scales : below 50 nm , the apparent hurst exponent increases towards @xmath36 as one essentially observes the smooth initial surface in between the deformation - induced surface steps .    to further investigate the statistical surface properties in the different scale regimes , probability distributions @xmath39 of surface height differences @xmath40 </S>",
    "<S> have been determined for the profiles taken at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 m was taken as a reference and all height differences @xmath43 were normalized by the variance @xmath44 nm of the corresponding height difference distribution . within the scaling regime @xmath45 ( @xmath46 nm , @xmath47 m ) </S>",
    "<S> , probability distributions corresponding to    different values of @xmath33 can be collapsed by re - scaling @xmath48 with @xmath49 ( see figure [ stat ] ) : @xmath50^h \\delta y_l / y_0 ) = p(\\delta y_{l_0}/y_0)\\;.\\ ] ] to assess the shape of the probability distributions , cumulative distributions normalized to unit variance have been represented on a probability scale ( i.e. , the error function appears as a straight line ) . </S>",
    "<S> the insert of figure [ stat ] shows the cumulative distribution for @xmath51 m ( full line ) as well as two distributions for @xmath33 values outwith the scaling regime , namely for @xmath52 nm ( dashed line ) and @xmath53 m ( dotted line ) . whereas distributions throughout the self - affine scaling regime are well approximated by gaussian statistics , the tails of distributions outwith the scaling regime exhibit characteristic deviations from gaussian behavior . on scales below @xmath54 the surface morphology </S>",
    "<S> is characterized by flat regions separated by huge slip steps at locations where slip events have occurred . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a leptokurtic distribution with heavy tails . on scales above @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the surface flattens and large height fluctuations are suppressed since the macroscopic slope of the swli profiles is by definition set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to platykurtic distributions with truncated tails .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the statistics is gaussian throughout the scaling regime implies that the surface profiles @xmath8 can be mathematically interpreted as graphs of fractional brownian motions . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to draw conclusions on the underlying plastic strain pattern since the increments @xmath56 of a fractional brownian motion exhibit long - range correlations given by @xcite @xmath57 since @xmath56 equals the component @xmath9 of the plastic distortion tensor at the surface , our observations yield strong evidence for power - law correlations in the distribution of plastic strain . from the correlation </S>",
    "<S> integral @xmath58 we deduce a correlation dimension @xmath59 for the one - dimensional strain pattern underlying the surface profile . </S>",
    "<S> the value @xmath60 is consistent with the fractal dimension of slip line patterns reported by kleiser and bocek @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a dimension of 0.5 for a one - dimensional strain pattern is also consistent with the dimension @xmath61 for the three - dimensional pattern of slip events measured by weiss and marsan @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations were performed on single crystals ; due to experimental limitations the scaling regimes cover only about one order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the strain pattern in polycrystals exhibits an analogous self - similar behavior which by combining different experimental techniques can be traced over almost four orders of magnitude in scale .    </S>",
    "<S> more investigations are required to decide whether the hurst exponent @xmath1 which we determine for deformed metal surfaces is universal , i.e. independent of material and deformation conditions . </S>",
    "<S> further investigations are also needed to establish the nature of the boundaries of the self - affine scaling regime . </S>",
    "<S> the lower bound of the scaling regime can be related to the spacing between individual slip events between which the surface remains unchanged by the deformation . </S>",
    "<S> the upper boundary @xmath55 of the scaling regime , which defines the correlation length of the self - affine surface pattern , is of the same order of magnitude as the grain size ( 40 microns ) . </S>",
    "<S> one may reasonably conjecture that the range of correlations in the dislocation dynamics , and therefore in the slip pattern , is limited by the grain size . </S>",
    "<S> however , further experimental work ( preferably on single crystals ) is required to decide whether this is indeed the physical mechanism which determines the correlation length .    from the theoretical side , the fact that the hurst exponent of deformed metal surfaces is quite similar to that of fracture surfaces raises the fundamental question whether there is a universal mechanism underlying both observations , or whether the similarity of exponents is incidental . </S>",
    "<S> crystal plasticity is a bulk phenomenon which only indirectly affects the surface , whereas fracture is directly governed by surface and interface properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , this does not preclude the possibility of a common theoretical treatment within the framework of non - equilibrium critical phenomena .    in view of plasticity models using coarse - grained strain variables , </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that strain fluctuations may average out rather slowly . </S>",
    "<S> the strain fluctuation on scale @xmath33 can be estimated as @xmath62 . at the lower end of the self - affine scaling regime ( @xmath46 nm ) , fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the average strain . within the scaling regime , </S>",
    "<S> strain fluctuations decrease like @xmath63 if averaged over the length @xmath33 ; for @xmath64 we find that the residual strain fluctuations at the upper end of the scaling regime ( @xmath65 m ) are still about 15 % of the average strain . </S>",
    "<S> this observation explains why it is possible to detect significant strain fluctuations even on macroscopic scales @xcite . </S>"
