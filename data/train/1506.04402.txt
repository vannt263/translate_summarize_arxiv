    "with the development of nano technologies , electronic devices can be fabricated with scales down to mesoscopic size . in such scale ,",
    "some of the physical properties of mesoscopic system change dramatically with the system size .",
    "for example , while thermal conductivity @xmath0 for dielectric or semiconductor materials is a size independent in macroscopic system , it depends on the system size drastically in mesoscopic scale  @xcite .",
    "the size effects on the @xmath0 have been confirmed by the experiments  @xcite .",
    "especially the experiment basing on the transient thermal grating ( ttg ) shows that the @xmath0 increases with increasing system size and is converged to a finite value for the infinite system size  @xcite .",
    "there exist two contradictions between such experimental results and the known theories .",
    "one is that calculations based on the harmonic interaction of atoms give rise to a divergent @xmath0 even if the disorder and anharmonic interaction in the model are involved  @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called divergence problem in thermal transport .",
    "the second contradiction is the decreasing of @xmath0 with the system size .",
    "some authors have introduced a soft cut - off @xmath4 for the mean free path of phonons  @xcite .",
    "they claimed that the phonons with the mean free path @xmath5 contribute little to the thermal transport . but how @xmath4 appear is still unknown . in this paper",
    ", we give a simple model which can resolve above two contradictions .",
    "+ generally , the thermal transport for one dimensional system is simplified as the coupling between oscillators ordered in chain . for a chain with a finite length ,",
    "the oscillator number is noted by @xmath1 and the lattice parameter is @xmath6 .",
    "the heat baths are attached to the two ends of the oscillator chain as a whole model  @xcite .",
    "it has been rigorously proved that if the coupling between the oscillators is harmonic , the thermal conductivity @xmath0 diverges with the increasing of the size @xmath7  @xcite . even by invoking the disorder and anharmonic interaction in the model to enhance the thermal resistance ,",
    "@xmath0 is still not converged for the infinite size  @xcite , which is the well - known divergence problem of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the divergence problem has been revealed by some other models in the real space , such as the hydrodynamics model  @xcite , and the model basing on the mode - coupling theory  @xcite . according to those models , the relation between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 follows a power law by @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the exponent @xmath2 varies from model to model  @xcite .",
    "+ in the phonon space , the divergence problem is naturally removed by the phonon scattering .",
    "the phonon scattering enhances the thermal resistance and converges the @xmath0 to be a finite value @xmath10 for the infinite size  @xcite .",
    "the phonon scattering has been implemented in the relaxation time @xmath11 .",
    "here , @xmath12 is the heat capacity of the system and @xmath13 is the averaged group velocity of phonon .",
    "the mechanisms for the phonon scattering are various , such as by umklapp scattering  @xcite .",
    "molecular dynamics(md ) simulation has also been used to study the mechanism  @xcite . in order to simplify the calculation ,",
    "the approximation of single - mode relaxation time @xmath14 has been applied to identify the contribution of each phonon at a wave vector @xmath15 in the brillouin zone(bz ) .",
    "then the @xmath16 is modified to be @xmath17 with the integral over the whole bz  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no entire model covering the whole bz is available for the @xmath18 yet .",
    "some authors have proposed that @xmath19 for phonon scattering at high frequency @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "such relation can not be extended to the low frequency range . or",
    ", it is unphysical that @xmath18 goes to infinity when @xmath20 is approaching to the @xmath21 point of bz , which also leads to an divergent @xmath16 . in order to simplify the phonon scattering for low frequency phonon",
    ", we make a assumption to modify the model by @xmath22 for the extension . here , @xmath23 a positive constant , dominating the @xmath18 when @xmath20 goes to zero .",
    "the introduction of @xmath23 into the @xmath18 is reasonable since the mean free path @xmath24 of phonon has been measured to be a finite value  @xcite . + the size effect on the @xmath0 can be obtained in the term of phonon - boundary(pb ) scattering  @xcite .",
    "the pb scattering means that phonons are scattered by the boundaries with the relation of @xmath25 , which decreases the @xmath0 for the finite system size  @xcite .",
    "but this is in fact incorrect in ttg case since the ttg is formed within a si thin film and no any interfaces exist for the pb scattering  @xcite . in the ttg case ,",
    "the authors have introduced a soft cut - off @xmath4 for the mean free path of phonons to show the size effect on the @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 means that the phonons with the mean free path @xmath26 contribute little to the thermal transport . but why does the ttg system have the @xmath4 ? in this work , we will show that only a few phonon modes are selected to take part in the thermal transport instead of the total phonons in the bz .",
    "such mechanism is beyond the pb scattering .",
    "we consider the ttg as an uniformly ordered chain in one dimension with an infinite length .",
    "the oscillator number in one grating period is the @xmath1 .",
    "the interaction between the oscillators is harmonic and the phonon scattering has been implemented in the relaxation time @xmath18 .",
    "the phonon dispersion relation of the ttg can be obtained by using the lattice dynamics theory and the wave vector @xmath15 is obtained by applying the born - von karmen boundary condition(bkbc ) on the chain  @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath27 of the system is the summation of the hamiltonian of each oscillator by @xmath28 . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the hamiltonian of the @xmath30 oscillator , which is @xmath31 . in this expression",
    ", @xmath32 is the displacement of the @xmath30 oscillator deviating from its equilibrium position and @xmath33 is the momentum .",
    "@xmath34 is the force constant for the interaction between the @xmath30 and the @xmath35 oscillators .",

    "the first term means the work done by all the other oscillators on the @xmath30 oscillator while the second term is for a reversed process .",
    "we introduce the creation operator @xmath38 and annihilation operator @xmath39 for phonon at @xmath15 , and rewrite the total hamiltonion as @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath46 is the equilibrium position of the @xmath30 oscillator .",
    "+ since the energy of each oscillator is real and periodical in the chain by @xmath47 , it can be obtained from the eq.([eq1 ] ) that @xmath15 or @xmath48 takes only the values of @xmath49 that means only the phonon at @xmath50 are selected to take part in the time evolving of @xmath29 and are responsible for the decaying of the ttg .",
    "all the other phonon modes not at @xmath50 in the bz act as a constant thermal background , and are eliminated after the time derivative . for the selected phonon ,",
    "the nearest wave vector close to the @xmath21 point is @xmath51 with @xmath52 , indicating that phonon in the range of @xmath53 contributes little to the thermal transport even though with their large mean free paths .",
    "thus , @xmath54 acts as the origin for the soft cut - off @xmath4 proposed in the models for the ttg  @xcite .",
    "the amount of the selected phonon modes @xmath50 equals @xmath1 .",
    "that means fewer phonon modes are selected for the thermal transport for smaller @xmath1 by modulating the thermal grating . in this way",
    ", the size effect of the @xmath0 can be clarified .",
    "this issue will be specified later .",
    "+ before we calculate the @xmath0 for the ttg , we turn to another type of the oscillator chains with a finite length of the total chain , comparing to the ttg with a finite length of one period but an infinite length of the total chain .",
    "such finite - size chain(fsc ) can be found like the nanotubes  @xcite .",
    "we will get the similar result of the ttg for the fsc .",
    "the fsc is a uniformly ordered chain in one dimension with two open ends , and @xmath1 now represents the total number of the oscillators of the chain . for convenience , we index the ordered oscillators from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the chain reads @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the geometric structure factor(gsf ) of the chain , and defined as @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 for other cases . by using the gsf ,",
    "the fsc is extended to be infinitely long without any changing to the total hamiltonian .",
    "the motivation for such extension is that the lattice dynamics theory and the bkbc can only be applicable on the chain with an infinite length . in this way",
    ", we can get the basic phonon dispersion relation as a start point for the study of fsc .",
    "we use @xmath62 to denote the total number of oscillators of the extended chain with @xmath63 .",
    "we rewrite the hamiltonian by using the fourier transformation @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath65 is the normal coordinate of phonon at @xmath66 for the extended chain .",
    "the hamiltonian then reads @xmath67 here , @xmath68 is the gsf defined in the phonon space , which is obtained by the fourier transformation of @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath68 has an expression of @xmath70 .",
    "the basic phonon dispersion relation @xmath71 of the extended chain is obtained by the fourier transformation of the force constant @xmath34 .",
    "it can be found that the normal coordinates @xmath72 are coupled to each other due to the finite size effect .",
    "it is also found that when @xmath1 is approaching to @xmath62 , the gsf @xmath68 goes to @xmath73 and eq.([eq3 ] ) recovers the diagonalized hamiltonian @xmath74 for a real infinitely long chain .",
    "+ we introduce a new set of coordinates @xmath75 in the phonon space by the definition of @xmath76 .",
    "the motion equation of the @xmath77 then reads @xmath78 in integral form .",
    "the rigorous numerical solution to the integral equation is not applicable due to the highly oscillated integral kernel .",
    "it is expected that the density distribution of the phonon eigenmodes as the solutions are narrow peaks located at some wave vectors .",
    "we approximate the density peaks as @xmath79 functions and denote the locations of the eigenmodes by @xmath80 or @xmath81 in the following .",
    "thus , the density of states ( dos ) of @xmath80 mode phonon is noted by @xmath82 . the dos is used to transform the eq.([eq4 ] ) to be in the form of summation , reading @xmath83 with @xmath84 the frequency of the @xmath80 mode and @xmath85 .",
    "the phonon eignmodes of the solution should be decoupled to each other , meaning @xmath86 must be held to reduce the eq.([eq6 ] ) to be @xmath87 . here , @xmath88 represents integers .",
    "then , one obtains that the locations of the phonon eigenmodes @xmath89 of the fsc are at @xmath90 with @xmath88 the integers in the range of @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "this result is the same as that of ttg , only different in meaning of @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath1 is approaching to @xmath62 for the infinitely long chain , the equation of motion for the @xmath80 mode should recover @xmath92 .",
    "that means the eigenfrequency @xmath84 must be equal to @xmath93 and @xmath94 equals @xmath95 .",
    "physically , @xmath96 is the degeneracy of the @xmath80 mode per unit length of the fsc .",
    "it is interesting that applying the bkbc directly on the fsc by using the plane waves as the lattice waves can get the same result of @xmath50 .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that the direct application of the bkbc is not rigorous for the study , since the dos of phonon eignmodes are not exactly the @xmath79 functions according to eq.([eq5 ] ) .",
    "+ fig.1(a ) shows the phonon dispersion relation of the fsc by the discrete data points while the solid continuous line is the relation for the infinitely long chain . for the calculation in this paper , the dispersion relation of @xmath97",
    "is used as an example with @xmath98 of silicon applied  @xcite . and the lattice parameter is set to be @xmath99 for simplicity .",
    "+   +    comparing to the solid line , phonon modes not at @xmath50 are absent for the fsc .",
    "especially , the phonon in the range of @xmath100 have no contribution to the thermal transport for the fsc .",
    "the absence of the phonon close to the @xmath21 point for the thermal transport has been confirmed by the ttg experiment  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the phonon modes of two types of the mesoscopic structures .",
    "one type of the structures is the ttg and the other type is the fsc .",
    "the two types of the structures have the same result that only a few phonons located at @xmath50 can take part in the thermal transport .",
    "we call these phonons by selected phonons . the total amount of the modes of the selected phonons equals @xmath1 . the period length of ttg or the total length of the fsc , both of which have been denoted by @xmath101 in this paper , can be changed to bring three effects on the phonon behaviors .",
    "suppose the @xmath1 is decreased as an example to specify the three effects .",
    "the first effect is that the mode amount @xmath1 of the selected phonons then is reduced in the bz .",
    "the second effect is that the @xmath102 is enhanced for each selected phonon mode .",
    "actually , these two effects are canceled for the thermal transport due to the produce of the mode amount and the degeneracy as a constant of @xmath103 .",
    "the third effect is that the selected phonon mode close to the @xmath21 point are shifted to higher frequencies by @xmath104 .",
    "according to the bose - einstein distribution @xmath105 , higher frequency state has fewer averaged phonon amount at a fixed temperature .",
    "thus , the third effect leads to fewer phonons taking part into the thermal transport , which is the key mechanism to the size effect on @xmath0 .",
    "+ now we jump to the calculation of @xmath0 .",
    "the general expression of the @xmath0 reads @xmath106 here , @xmath96 has been understood as the degeneracy of the selected phonon mode . for the fsc ,",
