    ", the effective energy ( see eq.([enper ] ) ) must become negative . using this condition",
    ", we find the phase diagrams for the vortex states , which depend on @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "the residual symmetry of the ground state is @xmath104 , with reflection in all specific lines of squares .",
    "this peculiar symmetry violation stems from a highly inhomogeneous magnetic field distribution : the screened magnetic field is logarithmically divergent near the boundaries of the fm dots . as a result",
    ", the vortices and the antivortices are dragged into these regions .",
    "we considered a periodic array of fm dots on a sc film . in the first section",
    ", we presented the formalism which is modified for the case of periodic structures . in this formalism , the problem is formulated as a variational principle which allows us to calculate directly the positions of vortices .",
    "we applied this formalism to the case of the square array of the fm dots .",
    "we have demonstrated that the dots can generate the vortices under themselves and antivortices at interstitial locations .",
    "thus , the symmetry of the dot array is spontaneously violated by vortices and antivortices . for different values of the size of the dot and the magnetization , we calculated the positions of the vortices and the antivortices and the phase transition curves which separate the regions with and and without vortex - antivortex pairs .",
    "the transition is of the first order in our approximation .",
    "it turns out that , when the ratio @xmath76 increases , then the minimal value of the ratio @xmath78 necessary for the spontaneous creation of vortex - antivortex pairs decreases .",
    "we assumed that only one vortex - antivortex pair per elementary cell of the array is generated .",
    "the problem of many pairs has not yet been solved .",
