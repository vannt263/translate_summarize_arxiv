    "symmetry reduction in loop quantum gravity is crucially linked to the concept of invariant connections on principal fibre bundles . here",
    "symmetries are represented by lie groups of automorphisms of the bundle of interest .",
    "quantizing the corresponding set of invariant connections , i.e. , quantizing the reduced classical theory gives something often considered as reduced quantum configuration space .",
    "as for the full theory quantization just means to consider the spectrum of a separating @xmath1-subalgebra of the bounded functions thereon .",
    "these algebras usually are generated by matrix entries of parallel transports along certain curves in the base manifold .",
    "doing symmetry reduction in this fashion one should be aware of the following issues .",
    "* let @xmath2 and @xmath13 denote the @xmath1-algebras used to define the quantum configuration spaces of the full and the reduced theory , respectively .",
    "if one wants the reduced quantum space to be canonically embedded into that of the full theory , then one has to ensure that the restriction of the @xmath1-algebra @xmath2 to the set of invariant connections @xmath14 is contained in @xmath13 .",
    "so , the most natural thing that one can do in this situation is to define @xmath15 . * the quantized spaces",
    "very crucially depend on the set of curves that are used to define the @xmath1-algebras @xmath2 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "a very telling example for this is given by homogeneous isotropic loop quantum cosmology . here originally the set of linear curves was used to define the reduced quantum configuration space .",
    "@xcite this leads to the bohr compactification @xmath16 of @xmath17 .",
    "adjoining one single circular curve . ] already inflates this space to @xmath12 on which no longer a haar measure exists . and for topology on @xmath12 cf .",
    "@xcite or subsection [ subsec : nogoes ] . ]",
    "* there are two non - trivial steps to execute .",
    "first one has to calculate the set of invariant connections that correspond to the lie group of automorphisms that represents the symmetry in question . here",
    "wang s theorem @xcite may help provided that the action induced on the base manifold is transitive . in the general case the calculation can be exhausting but the real challenge usually is to calculate the spectrum of @xmath13 . for homogeneous isotropic lqc",
    "this is easy if one only takes linear curves into account .",
    "however , in this case there exists no canonical embedding of @xmath16 into the quantum configuration space of the full theory arising from the fact that the latter one is defined by using all embedded analytic curves instead of just the linear ones .",
    "@xcite then , if one uses embedded analytic curves also for the reduced space , the calculation is narrowly performable because @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite also for the homogeneous case this seems not to be completely hopeless since here @xmath14 is in bijection with @xmath19 which is still a finite dimensional vector space .",
    "but , already in the semi - homogeneous case , i.e. , if we require invariance under translations w.r.t .",
    "a subspace of @xmath20 , things become really difficult since @xmath14 is parametrized by functions in this case .",
    "applying the above procedure means to quantize a reduced classical space and one may ask if it there is nt some loss of information in comparison with reducing the quantum space directly .",
    "so , also in view of the last two points one may look for an alternative , more handy approach that allows for a symmetry reduction on quantum level .    in the present article we provide such a reduction concept by investigating under",
    "which assumptions a left action of a group on a set can be extended to an action on the spectrum of a @xmath1-subalgebra of the bounded functions on this set .",
    "the crucial observation then is that a lie group of automorphisms @xmath0 of a principal fibre bundle defines a left action @xmath21 on the corresponding set of smooth connections @xmath22 in such a way that @xmath23 .",
    "so , if @xmath7 is an extension of this action to @xmath24 , then we can define the reduced quantum space @xmath25 to consist of all invariant generalized connections , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "we show that this is possible in a unique way if the set of curves that is used for the definition of @xmath2 is invariant in a certain sense .",
    "it turns out that this procedure always leads to a bigger reduced quantum space which is even strictly bigger in the analytic cosmological case . in the physically relevant situations @xmath25",
    "is characterized by a simple algebraic relation that allows for some measure theoretical considerations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :    * section [ sec : prelimin ] contains preparatory material such as notations , basic definitions and some of their elementary implications . * in section [ sec : specextgr ] we discuss under which assumption a left action @xmath21 of group @xmath0 on a set @xmath9 can be extended to an action on the spectrum of a @xmath1-subalgebra of the bounded functions on @xmath9 . for this",
