    "multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for quantum computation , with many mysteries yet to be understood  @xcite . a particularly useful and interesting set of multipartite entangled states are the so - called graph states  @xcite .",
    "these are quantum states associated with mathematical graphs , where vertices represent qubits in superposition states and edges represent the maximally entangling controlled - phase ( @xmath0 ) gates between them .",
    "building complex graph states is a difficult task in practice ( i.e. in experiments ) , because it requires the application of @xmath0 gates between arbitrary qubits ; that said , considerable strides have been made in recent years  @xcite .",
    "it is nevertheless useful to consider the circumstances under which specific multipartite graph states can be constructed efficiently .",
    "a class of particularly useful graph states are quantum error - correcting codes ( qeccs ) .",
    "these are used to prevent quantum information leakage , since quantum information is generically fragile against interactions with the environment  @xcite .",
    "standard qeccs can protect quantum information against an arbitrary error on a single qubit .",
    "several schemes of measurement - based quantum computation with embedded quantum error correction have been recently proposed but the structure of logical cluster states is very complex  @xcite .",
    "very recently , a concatenation scheme for a single logical qubit encoded in the five - qubit qecc ( 5qecc ) has been studied in the graph - state context  @xcite . while topological approaches to fault - tolerance in graph - state quantum computation yield higher error thresholds  @xcite , directly encoding the quantum information in qecc graphs might turn out to be more practical experimentally if efficient methods for constructing these states can be found .",
    "we propose that multipartite graph states , which are useful for constructing logical cluster states with 5qecc , can be efficiently built by local hadamard operations from simpler graph states . in this paper",
    ", we prove that the mathematical operation called _ edge local complementation _",
    "( elc ) @xcite , which is defined by a series of _ local complementation _ ( lc ) operations on a graph @xcite , is efficiently realizable in specific graph states because it is equivalent to the action of local hadamard operations . from the mathematical point of view , lc transforms a given graph into another , with a different adjacency matrix ; in practice , local complementation of a given vertex complements the subgraph corresponding to its neighborhood . from the quantum information point of view",
    ", lc corresponds to a set of local operations on a given graph state that therefore preserves any entanglement measure , yet describes a different graph state .",
    "yet the cost of generating the new graph from a completely unentangled state would be significantly higher if the total number of edges is larger than in the original graph state .",
    "our results indicate that the apparently complex nature of multipartite 5qecc states should not in itself be an impediment to their experimental generation , because they are in fact generically simple graphs under elc .",

    "<S> a method is presented for the implementation of edge local complementation in graph states , based on the application of two hadamard operations and a single controlled - phase ( cz ) gate . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate an efficient scheme to construct a one - dimensional logical cluster state based on the five - qubit quantum error - correcting code , using a sequence of edge local complementations . </S>",
    "<S> a single physical cz operation , together with local operations , is sufficient to create a logical cz operation between two logical qubits . </S>",
