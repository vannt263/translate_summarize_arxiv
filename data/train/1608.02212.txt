    "the unusual suppression of density fluctuations at large length scales is central to the hyperuniformity concept , whose broad importance for condensed matter physics and materials science was brought to the fore only about a decade ago in a study that focused on fundamental theoretical aspects , including how it provides a unified means to classify and categorize crystals , quasicrystals and special disordered point configurations @xcite .",

    "[ turing1 ]    while this outcome does not mean that thresholded turing - type patterns can never be hyperuniform , it does lead to the following question : are there disordered stealthy and hyperuniform two - phase systems with spectral densities in which scattering is concentrated within some relatively thin annulus defined by a small range of wavenumbers away from the origin ? to answer this question , we consider the following hypothetical , idealized scaled spectral functions to see if they can fall within this possible stealthy and hyperuniform class : @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a radial dirac delta function is @xmath0-dimensional fourier space , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 using the results of [ ft ] , the corresponding hypothetical scaled autocovariance function , which obeys the exact limiting conditions ( [ limits-2 ] ) , are given by @xmath166 and @xmath167 where @xmath168    using the results of [ ft ] , we can expand the aforementioned putative autocovariance functions about @xmath89 to yield @xmath169 and @xmath170 where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are positive @xmath0-dimensional constants .",

    "the hyperuniformity sum rule ( [ sum-3 ] ) provides conditions on the parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which will depend on the dimension .",
    "for example , for @xmath191 , we immediately conclude that ( [ i ] ) can never correspond to a hyperuniform medium because ( [ sum-3 ] ) can not be satisfied . on the other hand , for @xmath192 and @xmath193 , hyperuniformity requires that @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively , implying that the autocovariance function for a hyperuniform system in a particular dimension generally does not correspond to a hyperuniform system in another dimension .",
    "moreover , these are only necessary conditions on the parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 for the existence of a hyperuniform two - phase medium and one must still check whether the known realizability conditions for two - phase media ( described sec . [ realize ] ) are satisfied .",
    "as it turns out , all of these realizability conditions are satisfied , including the nonnegativity of the spectral density [ cf .",
