    "in this paper , we continue a rich tradition of extending the notion of classical pattern avoidance in permutations to other structures .",
    "given permutations @xmath0 and @xmath1 we say that @xmath2 _ contains _ @xmath3 as a pattern if there exist @xmath4 such that @xmath5 if and only if @xmath6 . in this case",
    "we say that @xmath7 is _ order - isomorphic _ to @xmath3 and that @xmath7 _ reduces to _ @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath2 does not contain @xmath3 , then @xmath2 is said to _ avoid _ @xmath3 . the classical definition of pattern avoidance in permutations has shown itself to be worthwhile in many fields including algebraic geometry @xcite and theoretical computer science @xcite .",
    "analogues of pattern avoidance have been developed for a variety of combinatorial objects including dyck paths @xcite , tableaux @xcite , set partitions @xcite , trees @xcite , posets @xcite , and many more .",
    "we use a definition of pattern avoidance that is similar to that used in the study of heaps @xcite , but distinct from that used in previous studies of trees . unlike the question studied by hopkins and weiler @xcite which identified classes of posets for which certain properties are preserved , we extend the enumerative question of pattern avoidance to a particular class of posets .    a _",
    "task - precedence poset _ is a poset which represents the order relations between several tasks to be completed .",
    "we are particularly interested in considering @xmath8 identical task - precedence posets , and here we focus our attention on those sets of tasks that require one task be completed before any others , and one final task after any others , with no restrictions on the rest of the tasks in the list . when considering a list of @xmath9 tasks , the hasse diagram of this poset is a diamond , and as such we will refer to a task - precedence poset of this type with @xmath10 tasks as a _ diamond _ with @xmath10 vertices ( each with @xmath11 vertices in the middle level ) .",
    "we then assign unique labels from @xmath12 to each vertex such that the labels obey the order relations of each diamond .",
    "we then refer to the set of all such labelled collections of diamonds as @xmath13    given an element @xmath14 of @xmath15 we associate a permutation @xmath16 by recording the vertex labels as they are encountered reading the labels on each diamond consecutively , left to right by levels , beginning with the least element . for example",
    ", if @xmath14 is as pictured in figure [ tikz1 ] , then @xmath17 we say that @xmath14 contains ( respectively avoids ) @xmath3 as a pattern if @xmath16 contains ( respectively avoids ) @xmath3 as a classical pattern , using the definition above",

    ", instead of having human employees walk the warehouse floor retrieving items one after another to complete an order , amazon began utilizing kiva robots in their package fulfillment warehouses @xcite .",
    "each robot executes @xmath9 pieces of the larger task .",
    "we assign robots to diamonds ordered by the weight of the object they will deliver , heaviest object first , so that the tasks to retrieve the first , heaviest object are represented in diamond @xmath26 , and the lightest object by the final diamond .",
    "first the robot drives to the appropriate inventory rack and mounts the rack on its back",
    ". then it can either drive through the warehouse highways to its picker ( the human employee who will retrieve the item off the rack without leaving their station ) , or it can rotate itself so that the appropriate side of the rack is facing the picker . both of these need to be completed before the final step : having the item picked off the rack by the human employee in order to place it in its shipping box . in this way , completing one order of @xmath8 items from amazon.com is exactly the task - precedence poset represented by @xmath8 diamonds with @xmath9 vertices each .",
    "we now give an example of this process , referring throughout to figure [ robot ] .",
    "a customer has made an order for @xmath27 objects , @xmath28 , with weights @xmath29 thus the leftmost diamond will represent the tasks completed by the robot retrieving object @xmath26 , the center diamond for retrieving object @xmath30 , and the rightmost diamond for retrieving object @xmath27 .",
    "the labels represent the order in which each task of the @xmath31 total tasks is executed .",
    "each robot operates autonomously and independently , and each faces its own challenges .",
    "for example one of the objects may be at the back of the warehouse , there may be significant traffic along some of the paths the robots travel through the warehouse , or the robot assigned to retrieve an object may still be executing its previous assignment .",
    "thus the labels on the least elements of each diamond can vary significantly , and there can be a large difference in the labelling of the least element of a particular diamond and its greatest element . in figure [ robot ] , the first task completed is that the robot for object @xmath27 arrives and picks up the rack containing object @xmath27 .",
    "next , the robot retrieving object @xmath26 arrives at the rack containing object @xmath26 .",
    "next , the robot carrying object @xmath26 rotates its rack on its back to have the correct orientation to the picker .",
