    "particle - identification ( pid ) capability plays an essential role in experiments at b - factories .",
    "especially , @xmath0k identification in the momentum range up to 4 gev / c over a wide angular region is crucially important for the primary physics goals to measure cp violation . in the belle detector at kek - b ,",
    "a combination of aerogel cherenkov counters , tof counters and de / dx measurement in a central drift chamber ( cdc ) provides pid information for charged particles [ 1 ] .",
    "although the present detector system covers most of the momentum region of the charged particles , the pid power for a particle with momentum above 3 gev / c is not sufficiently satisfactory .",
    "concerning the future upgrade of pid devices , we discuss here the effectiveness of measuring both the time - of - propagation ( top ) and the emission - angle of the cherenkov photons .",
    "the time resolution of the time - of - flight ( tof ) counter using a plastic scintillator is inherently limited by the following effects besides the transit - time spread ( tts ) of a phototube : ( 1 ) a finite decay - time of photon emission , and ( 2 ) a different photon propagation - length or propagation - time in the scintillator to a phototube , depending on the photon emission angle .",
    "thus , the conventional tof counter measures the arrival time of the earliest photons out of many , whereby the remaining large amount of photons are not effectively used for the time measurement . while effect ( 1 )",
    "can not be reduced as far as the scintillation is concerned , effect ( 2 ) can be resolved by the measuring the arrival times of the earliest photons as a function of the photon emission angle , since , in the total - reflection - type scintillator bar , most photons propagate in the scintillator while keeping their original emission angles .",
    "this two - dimensional information could improve the time resolution , depending on the number of angular segmentations of the photon detector and on the number of photons collected at each segment .",
    "when cherenkov radiation is utilized , although its number of produced photons is much smaller than in the scintillation case , effect ( 1 ) can , in principle , be disregarded .",
    "in addition , since the cherenkov photon emission - angle is uniquely determined by the particle velocity ( @xmath1 ) and since the propagation time of photons in a light guide of an internal - total - reflection type can be calculated as a function of the photon emission angle , a measurement of a correlation between top and the photon emission anlge could provide pid information by itself , as we propose below .    in the dirc concept",
    "[ 2 , 3 ] , cherenkov photons produced by a quartz radiator are transported to an end of the radiator by means of internal total reflection , and its ring image is magnified and projected onto a photon - detector plane placed at the bar end .",
    "a basic study of this concept clearly proved that a photon is effectively transported in the long quartz bar , preserving its original photon direction .",
    "the babar detector at slac adopted this concept for pid , and introduced a large stand - off photon detection system in order to ineffectuate the finite size of the quartz cross - section onto the ring image [ 3 ] . on the other hand , kamae et al . [ 4 ] proposed a compact focussing type of dirc using a small mirror instead of a large stand - off system . this approach suits particles incident normal to the quartz bar , but for inclined particles the ring image is distorted due to the finite quartz cross - section . to make this image - fusing effect insignificant ,",
    "the size and geometry of the focussing mirror become unfeasible [ 5 ] .",
    "we propose here a new concept for the cherenkov - ring image detector , the top detector .",
    "the two - dimensional information of the ring image is represented by the top of the cherenkov photon and its horizontal angle ( @xmath2 ; see , fig.1 ) .",
    "the use of top information with an appropriate focussing mirror makes the image - fusing effect be disregarded and compactification can be realized while maintaining the high enough pid ability .",
    "we describe below the basic concept , characteristic features , practical configurations and simulation results on the top detector , and discuss some issuses for making it a realistic device .",
    "we should mention a paper by honsheid et al . [",
    "6 ] , which we noticed after our detailed analysis had been completed .",
    "it discusses the cherenkov correlated timing ( cct ) detector : cct [ 6 , 7 ] is a kind of tof counter with a single phototube readout for detecting early arriving photons of cherenkov radiation . in ref.[6 ] a similar concept as ours can be found , although no detailed study is presented and the focussing mirror approach is not introduced .",
    "the principal structure of the top counter in the ( @xmath3 ) coordinate system is illustrated in fig.1 . when a charged particle passes through the radiator bar , cherenkov photons are emitted in a conical direction defined by the emission angle ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5=1/@xmath6 , @xmath7=refractive index .",
    "then , photons propagate to both or either ends by means of total reflection on the internal bar surface .",
    "photons propagating backward are reflected by a flat mirror at the end . at the forward end",
    ", photons are horizontally focused by a butterfly - shaped mirror onto a plane where position - sensitive multi - anode phototubes are equipped to measure top as a function of the @xmath2-angle .",
    "the top is determined only by the z - component of the light velocity in the quartz bar as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the overall distance from the photon emission point to the detector , _",
    "n_@xmath10 is the refractive index of the quartz at wavelength @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the light velocity in a vacuum , and @xmath13 is the directional z - component of the photon emission .",
    "denoting the polar and azimuthal angles of an incident charged particle as @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see , fig.1 ) , respectively , the directional components of the photon velocity @xmath16 ( i=_x , y , z _ ) are written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 s ( @xmath19=@xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) are the directional components of the photon emission in the frame where the particle moves along the z@xmath23-axis : @xmath24 the horizontal and vertical photon angles at the bar end are then given as @xmath25 the @xmath26 angle of cherenkov photons distributes uniformly over 2@xmath27 .",
    "when we fix @xmath26 , individual three - directional components ( @xmath18 ) are uniquely related to @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , a measurement of any two directional components or any two combinations of them among eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) provides information about @xmath4 .    accordingly , in a top concept , we use the two parameters ( @xmath28 , @xmath2 ) for extracting @xmath4 , while in dirc , ( @xmath29 , @xmath2 ) are used .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that the @xmath28 measurement is not seriously influenced by the quartz bar cross - section .      here , we estimate various contributions to the accuracy of the top measurement with a detector which we are preparing for r&d work . by modelling the detector",
    "as presented in fig.1 , the parameters of each element and the expected machining or construction accuracy are assumed as described below .",
    "the size of the radiator bar is 20 mm - thick ( in @xmath30 ) , 60 mm - wide ( in @xmath31 ) , and about 3 150 mm ( in @xmath32 ) , on which a butterfly - shaped forcussing mirror block and a flat reflection mirror are attached at the forward and backward ends , respectively .",
    "the focussing mirror comprises two sub - elements , each forming an arc of a circle with a radius of 250 mm . as a pid detector for the belle experiment",
    ", we suppose these detectors to be placed at r=1 m from the beam axis to form a cylindrical configuration , and due to an asymmetric - energy collider the detector is asymmetrically configured with respect to the z - direction to cover the polar angle from 30@xmath33 to 140@xmath33 in the lab - frame . for simplicity of calculation",
    ", the photon - propagation length in the focussing mirror is set as 20 cm for all photons .",
    "the material of the radiator bar and the mirrors is synthetic optical quartz ( suprasil - p30 ) manufactured by shin - etsu quartz co. and their surfaces are polished by bikovsky - japan co. with a flatness of @xmath345 @xmath35 m .",
    "the quartz has a refractive index of @xmath7=1.47 at a wavelength ( @xmath11 ) of 390 nm and a transmittance of @xmath3690%/m at @xmath11=250 nm .",
    "the reflecting surface of the mirrors comprises aluminum of a few 100 nm - thick on 200 @xmath37-thick chromium by evaporation , which provides a reflection efficiency of 98% .",
    "the photon detector ( r5900u-00-l16 ) is a multi - anode ( 16 channel ) linear array phototube with a bialkali window by hamamatsu photonics co. although this tube does not function under a magnetic field , it has a quite suitable tts for our early r&d work without a magnetic field .",
    "+ now , by taking the above structure of the top counter into account , we estimate various contributions to the accuracy of the pid measurement .",
    "+ _ ( 1 ) @xmath11-dependence of n _",
    "the refractive index ( @xmath38 ) of the quartz varies depending on @xmath11 . as a result ,",
    "the cherenkov angle ( @xmath4 ) and the total reflection angle vary for individual photons in addition to the propagation velocity .",
    "the effect to top is @xmath39 where @xmath40 accounting for the @xmath11-dependence of the cherenkov photon yield and the @xmath11-dependent quantum efficiency of the phototube , we take @xmath7=1.47@xmath340.008 ( @xmath41= 5@xmath42 ) for the numerical calculation described in the next subsection .",
    "+ _ ( 2 ) angular resolution _",
    "the @xmath2-angle resolution depends on the position resolution of the phototube and the focussing accuracy of the mirror .",
    "the designed focussing mirror has a resolution of @xmath43=0.8 mm with a dispersion of @xmath44=0.5@xmath33/mm .",
    "since the phototube has a 0.8 mm anode width , as described below , the @xmath2 resolution is evaluated as @xmath45 .",
    "the @xmath2-dependent behavior of this effect on top shows a steep increase with @xmath2 , but a very small contribution at small @xmath2-angles , as numerically discussed in the next subsection .",
    "this limits the @xmath2 aparture to be @xmath46 45@xmath33 .",
    "+ _ ( 3 ) tts of the phototube _",
    "the phototube ( r5900u-00-l16 ) has a 16 mm @xmath47 16 mm photo - sensitive area , which is segmented into 16 strips with an area of 0.8 mm @xmath47 16 mm and a 0.2 mm space between adjacent strips .",
    "the quantum efficiency ( @xmath48 ) is 25% at 400 nm and @xmath4970 ps with a pulse rise - time of 0.6 ns for a single photoelectron .",
    "+ _ ( 4 ) timing accuracy of the start signal _",
    "we expect a start timing accuracy of 25 ps from the rf signal of the accelerator .",
    "+ _ ( 5 ) effect of the quartz thickness _    because relativistic particle takes 66 ps to pass through the 20 mm - thick quartz , the time spread of the cherenkov photon emission is estimated to be @xmath50= 20 ps ( = 66 /@xmath51 ) .",
    "when the incident particle is inclined with respect to the normal of the bar surface , the time - spread becomes much smaller due to cancelleration of the particle flight - time and the photon propagation - time .",
    "for instance , @xmath50 is 6 ps and 10 ps at @xmath14= 30@xmath33 and 60@xmath33 , respectively . + _ ( 6 ) effect of the charged - particle tracking accuracy _    in the belle detector , the z position of a charged - particle track is measured by the central drift chamber ( cdc ) with an accuracy of about 2 mm .",
    "this means that it corresponds to a time uncertainty of 10 ps .    on the other hand ,",
    "the accuracy of the momentum measurement is related to the accuracy of the cherenkov angle as @xmath52 since the cherenkov angle satisfies @xmath53 for our particles and the cdc provides @xmath54/p@xmath55 , @xmath56 can be ignored compared with the difference in the cherenkov angle between @xmath27 and k. the former is on the order of @xmath57 smaller than the latter .",
    "for instance , @xmath58 = 6.5 mrad , while @xmath56 is @xmath59 mrad and @xmath60 mrad for 4 gev / c @xmath27 and k , respectively .",
    "the accuracy of the incident - angle measurement contributes to the accuracy of the top measurement as @xmath61 and @xmath62 the effect of any @xmath14 ambiguity on top is evaluated to be less than 10 ps in the case of the belle detector [ 1 ] .",
    "it is an order - of - magnitude smaller than the contribution from item ( 3 ) ( @xmath4970 ps ) , and is thus disregarded .",
    "furthermore , it is , on the other hand , a specific feature of our approarch that the top is independent of @xmath15 , as is obvious from eq.(2 ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath15 ambiguity does not intrinsically affect the top measurement .      from the above",
    ", the uncertainty of the top measurement arises predominantly from the effects of items ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . in order to understand the top behavior and to evaluate the size of the above effects to top and the pid power , a calculation is performed with the following conditions .",

    "@xmath66(top+tof ) and individual effects _     in fig.2 ,",
    "the individual uncertainties of items ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3)@xmath23 are shown for various cases of the incident angle ( @xmath14 ) , in addition to the top+tof and top differences between 4 gev / c @xmath27 and k ( denoted hereafter as @xmath66(top + tof ) and @xmath66(top ) , respectively ) . ( the propagation length ( @xmath9 ) in figures ( a - e ) is uniquely determined for each @xmath14 by assuming the particle coming from the colliding point under our geometory .",
    "on the other hand , the length ( @xmath9 ) in figures ( f , g ) is not real , but hypothetical , only for discussion purposes . )",
    "the asymmetries seen in the figures are caused by deflection of the azimuthal angle of the incident particle due to an axial magnetic field of 1.5 t.    at normal incidence ( see , fig.2(c ) , ( d ) and ( g ) ) , effect ( 1 ) is an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath66(top ) ; this relation holds irrespective of @xmath9 , because of their proportionality to @xmath9 .",
    "effect ( 2 ) has a strong @xmath2 dependence . in the region of the small @xmath2-angle",
    "the effect is negligible , while in the large-@xmath2 region it becomes dominant in determining the resolution . mostly from this fact ,",
    "the @xmath2-angle aperture is limitted to @xmath67 , where the top measurement uncertainty is comparable to or less than @xmath66(top+tof ) under most of the incident - particle conditions . on the other hand , because @xmath14 deviates from normal incidence the value of @xmath68 decreases , and item ( 1 ) gives almost the same order of magnitude as @xmath66(top+tof ) at @xmath69 ( fig.2(a ) ) , and several to 10-times larger size at @xmath70 ( fig.2(e ) ) .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath66(top ) at small @xmath2 reverses at around @xmath71 or @xmath72 - 90@xmath73 45@xmath33 , since @xmath14 almost coincides with the cherenkov angle ( @xmath74 ) and then the relative magnitude of @xmath75@xmath76 of cherenkov photons from @xmath27 and k reverses ( see , fig.2(a , e , f ) ) . thus , in the case of large @xmath9 , as in fig.2(f ) , @xmath66(top ) is cancelled with @xmath66(tof ) , which reduces the pid power compared with the small @xmath9 case , as in fig.2(a ) .",

    "the summation is taken over for the photons with @xmath8345@xmath33 , which are totally reflected on the internal surface of the quartz bar . because the number of cherenkov photons for the 20 mm - thick quartz bar is fixed as @xmath84 with @xmath48=25% , @xmath85 is a normalization factor of @xmath86 .    in fig.3 the resultant @xmath77@xmath78 for @xmath27/k",

    "for instance , at 4 gev / c tracks with @xmath14=90@xmath33 , @xmath66(tof ) are 23 ps , which is only about 1/3 of @xmath103 .",
    "however , by setting a longer flight - length ( r ) , a sizable improvement can be realized , as listed in table 1 ; in such cases the top detector acts as a kind of a high - resolution tof counter by means of cherenkov radiation , since the cherenkov - angle difference does not produce sufficient @xmath66(top ) . + * the @xmath27/k separability by the top measurement has an angular dependence , as can be seen in fig.9 , while dirc gives a more - or - less flat distribution with the incident angle .",
    "especially , top shows a separability decrease at @xmath104 50@xmath33 , and it is in principle inevitable . on the other hand , top can give a larger @xmath77 at normal incidence .",
    "furthermore , in this case , top has the merit of doubling @xmath77 by detecting the both fw and bw going photons those of which have an arrival time difference of about 20 ns , so that they can be easily identified by using a multi - hit tdc with a high resolution . + * one possible way to improve the separability for tracks with a large incident angle is to equip an inclined surface , say , 45@xmath33 to the reflection mirror at the backward end .",
    "this will make the reclining cherenkov ring image stand up to the normal direction , so that it becomes a case close to a normal incidence track and photons propagate the full bar length .",
    "although an opposite effect occurs for a track with @xmath10490@xmath33 , a rather sufficient top difference is produced by propagating a certain long distance before the photons arrive at the reflection mirror .",
    "optimization of the inclining angle of the reflection mirror should be examined .",
    "+ * because the present design of the focussing mirror has a horizontally - extended structure , it is not suitable as a barrel detector , and therefore we need to find a practical optical structure for the compact system .",
    "although the vertically configured mirror avoids this geometrical problem , the choise of the horizontal configuration is due to the fact that the top+tof distribution for the vertical configuration has a larger differentiation to the angle @xmath29 , as shown in fig.10 , so that the top+tof measurement uncertainty becomes larger for an angle resolution of @xmath105 at the same accuracy as @xmath94 .",
    "+ the simplest and practical solution for the above is to tilt the counter around the z - axis by an angle of , for instance , 18.4@xmath33(=arctan(2 cm - thick/6 cm - width ) ) in our case , so that every mirror can avoid to interfere with each other .",
    "+ a top counter with a butterfly - shaped mirror , illustrated in fig.1 , has a symmterical geometry with respect to the z - axis . by dividing the butterfly mirror along the z - axis ,",
    "a half butterfly - shaped counter can be constructable , although the bar width also becomes half so as to have sufficient @xmath2-angle resolution . + * for simplicity of the calculation , the probability function ( p@xmath99/k ) ) is obtained in the previous section from the whole @xmath95(top+tof ) distributions within @xmath93=45@xmath33 , while the spread of the distribution has the @xmath2-dependence .",
    "therefore , if we properly take account of this @xmath2-dependence in the probability examination , better separability will be obtained .",
    "for instance , the rms of the distribution varies from 85 ps to 140 ps within the accepted @xmath2-angle region in the case of 4 gev / c normal incident tracks .",
    "+ * we assumed the detection of only the earliest single photon at each phototube anode in the previous section .",
    "it causes the loss of some photon fraction .",
    "for instance , it is about 30% of @xmath106 110 detectable photons at @xmath14=30@xmath33 , while it is about 10% of @xmath10656 and @xmath10630 photons at @xmath14=60@xmath33 and 90@xmath33 , respectively . +",
    "* it may be interesting to use a scintillator instead of the quartz material , as mentioned at the beginning , although the situation is somewhat obscure without a detailed study . because of its finite decay - time and non - unique photon emission - angle , the arrival - time distribution at individual @xmath2-angles will spread .",
    "however , it is the usual situation at the ordinary tof counter .",
    "since a large number of photons are provided in this case , when an optimized configuration is found to have a sufficient number of photons at each @xmath107-segmentation , the tof resolution could be improved by a factor of square - root of the number of detection segments .",
    "angular segmentation could be arranged wider than our top case , so that the focussing mirror could be smaller and the number of phototubes could be less .",
    "needless to say , the surface of the scintillator should be polished enough to allow photons to be internally reflected .",
    "although the above - mentioned issues concerning the phototube and the mirror structure remain , the proposed detector can be fully applicable as a pid device for experiments under a non - magnetic enviornment , mostly for fixed - target experiments . at fixed - target experiments , because incoming particles are incident nearly normal to the detector , the maximum separation power can be extracted .    with the use of a horizontal focussing mirror together with the fact that the time ambiguity of cherenkov radiation along the pass length is disregarded compared with the phototube tts",
    ", the cross section of the quartz radiator does not have any effects on top so that we can successfully avoid the unwanted image - fusing effect .",
    "the dirc counter [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] verified that the cherenkov image is well - transported by internal total reflection , and the cct counter [ 6 , 7 ] exhibited that a time measurement for such cherenkov photons is feasible . while the top detecter proposed here",
    "is based on a comprehensive compilation of the technical verification by those detecters , it can be used to exploit a new approach for measuring the top and @xmath2-angle correlation by making use of the horizontal focussing mirror . as a result",
    ", it would not only provide high particle identification ability , but also a more compact and flexible detector compared with the dirc and the gas cherenkov imaging detecter .",
