    "for instance , the sunspots and the solar active regions are related to the strongly inhomogeneous large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "the scales of the magnetic inhomogeneities , e.g. , in the sun are much smaller than the radius of the sun and usually much larger than the size of granules of the solar convection .",
    "one of the mechanisms of the formation of the magnetic inhomogeneities is associated with the magnetic buoyancy instability of stratified continuous magnetic field ( see , e.g. , parker 1966 , gilman 1970 , priest 1982 ) .",
    "the magnetic buoyancy instability is excited if the scale of variations of the initial magnetic field is less than the density stratification length .",
    "this mechanism does not include explicitly magnetic flux tubes . on the other hand ,",
    "the buoyancy of the magnetic flux tubes as a mechanism of the formation of the magnetic structures was studied in a number of publications ( see , e.g. , parker 1955 , spruit 1981 , spruit and van ballegooijen 1982 , schssler _ et al . _ 1994 , moreno - insertis _ et al .",
    "note also that the problem of the storage of magnetic fields and the formation of flux tubes in the overshoot layer near the bottom of the solar convective zone was investigated , e.g. , by spiegel and weiss ( 1980 ) , tobias _ et al . _",

    "another universal mechanism of the formation of the nonuniform distribution of magnetic flux in flows of the conducting fluid is a magnetic flux expulsion .",
    "in particular , the expulsion of magnetic flux from two - dimensional flows ( a single vortex and a grid of vortices ) was demonstrated by weiss ( 1966 ) . in the context of solar and stellar convection ,",
    "the topological asymmetry of stationary thermal convection plays very important role in the magnetic field dynamics ( drobyshevski and yuferev 1974 ) .",
    "fluid rises at the centers of the convective cells and falls at their peripheries .",
    "this results in that the ascending fluid elements ( contrary to the descending fluid elements ) are disconnected from one another .",
    "this causes a topological magnetic pumping effect allowing downward transport of the mean horizontal magnetic field to the bottom of a cell but impeding its upward return ( drobyshevski and yuferev 1974 , zeldovich _ et al .",

    "the fine structure of a sunspot is determined by the local interaction between magnetic fields and turbulent convection near the sun s surface .",
    "it was shown recently by thomas _",
    "( 2002 ) that a downward pumping of magnetic flux may cause of filamentary structures in sunspot penumbrae .",
    "in particular , the magnetic field lines are kept submerged outside the spot by turbulent , compressible convection , which is dominated by strong , coherent , descending plumes .",
    "turbulence causes additional effects , e.g. , the turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic drift velocities of the mean magnetic field ( zeldovich 1956 , krause and rdler 1980 , vainshtein and kichatinov 1983 , kichatinov 1991 , kichatinov and rdiger 1992 , kichatinov and pipin 1993 , kleeorin and rogachevskii 2003 , rdler _ et al .",

    "in particular , an inhomogeneity of the velocity fluctuations leads to a transport of mean magnetic flux from regions with high intensity of the velocity fluctuations ( turbulent diamagnetism , see , e.g. , zeldovich 1956 , krause and rdler 1980 , vainshtein and kichatinov 1983 , kichatinov and rdiger 1992 , rdler _ et al .",

    ", the magnetic flux is pushed into regions with high intensity of the magnetic fluctuations ( vainshtein and kichatinov 1983 , kichatinov 1991 , rdler _ et al .",
    "another effects are the effective drift velocities of the mean magnetic field caused by inhomogeneities of the fluid density ( kichatinov 1991 , kichatinov and rdiger 1992 ) and pressure ( kichatinov and pipin 1993 ) . in a nonlinear stage of the magnetic field evolution ,",
    "inhomogeneities of the mean magnetic field contribute to the diamagnetic or paramagnetic drift velocities depending on the level of magnetic fluctuations due to the small - scale dynamo and level of the mean magnetic field ( rogachevskii and kleeorin 2004 ) .",
    "the diamagnetic velocity causes a drift of the magnetic field components from the regions with a high intensity of the mean magnetic field .",
    "the pumping of magnetic flux in three - dimensional compressible magnetoconvection has been studied in direct numerical simulations by ossendrijver _",

    "the resulting magnetic pumping effects are isolated in the direct numerical simulations by calculating the turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities .",
    "the pumping effect in the vertical direction is found as a predominating downward advection with a maximum speed in the turbulent convection of about 10 percents of the turbulent velocity ( ossendrijver _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) .",
    "the turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities were determined analytically in previous studies only for purely hydrodynamic turbulence . a relation to the turbulent convection",
    "was made in some studies ( see , e.g. , kichatinov 1991 , kichatinov and pipin 1993 ) only phenomenologically , using the equation @xmath0 which follows from the mixing - length theory . here",

    "this relationship implies that the vertical turbulent heat flux plays a role of a stirring force for the turbulence .",
    "however , a more sophisticated approach implies a solution of a coupled system of dynamical equations which includes the equations for the reynolds stresses @xmath6 , the turbulent heat flux @xmath7 , the entropy fluctuations @xmath8 , the magnetic fluctuations @xmath9 , the cross helicity tensor @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a turbulent convection .",
    "the latter has not been taken into account in the previous studies of the small - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects caused by the turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic drift velocities .",
    "note that the turbulent convection can strongly affect these phenomena .",
    "the goal of this study is to determine the nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field in a turbulent convection .",
    "we demonstrate that the nonlinear drift velocities depend on the different kinds of the inhomogeneities : ( i ) inhomogeneous turbulence ; ( ii ) the nonuniform fluid density and ( iii ) the nonuniform turbulent heat flux .",
    "the inhomogeneous turbulence causes the well - known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities .",
    "in addition , the nonlinear drift velocities results in the small - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping in the turbulent convection .",
    "these phenomena are different from the large - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects .",
    "the large - scale phenomena are caused by the influence of the mean magnetic field on the large - scale fluid flow .",
    "our study shows that these large - scale effects are stronger than the small - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping only for a strong mean magnetic field ( about equipartition field ) .",
    "we study the small - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the context of the solar and stellar turbulent convection .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that in the main part of the solar convective zone the small - scale magnetic pumping effect dominates , while near the solar surface the radial drift velocity of the weak mean magnetic field results in the small - scale magnetic buoyancy effect .",

    "in this study we investigate the small - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in a turbulent convection .",

    "previous analytical studies of the small - scale magnetic pumping and buoyancy effects ( see kichatinov 1991 , kichatinov and rdiger 1992 , kichatinov and pipin 1993 ) were performed using the second order correlation approximation ( soca ) .",
    "this approximation is valid for small hydrodynamic reynolds numbers .",
    "indeed , even in a highly conductivity limit ( large magnetic reynolds numbers ) soca is valid only for small strouhal numbers , while for large hydrodynamic reynolds numbers ( fully developed turbulence ) the strouhal number is 1 . in the present study we take into account the inhomogeneity of the fluid density assuming that @xmath184 is weakly inhomogeneous ( see equation  ( [ k1 ] ) ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the models of the solar convective zone ( see , e.g. , spruit 1974 , baker and temesvary 1966 ) . on the other hand , in studies by kichatinov ( 1991 ) and kichatinov and rdiger ( 1992 )",
    "it was assumed that @xmath185 is weakly inhomogeneous .",
    "since the density in the solar convective zone varies over six orders of magnitude , the validity of the latter suggestion is questionable .",
    "in summary , we study the nonlinear drift of the mean magnetic field in a turbulent convection . three kinds of the inhomogeneities determine the nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field : ( i ) the inhomogeneous turbulence ; ( ii ) the nonuniform fluid density and ( iii ) the nonuniform turbulent heat flux .",
    "the inhomogeneous turbulence causes the well - known turbulent diamagnetic and paramagnetic velocities .",
    "the nonlinear drift velocities of the mean magnetic field result in the small - scale magnetic buoyancy and magnetic pumping effects in the turbulent convection . in the main part of the solar convective zone the small - scale magnetic pumping effect dominates ( i.e.",
    ", the radial nonlinear drift velocity of the mean magnetic field is directed downward to the bottom of the convective zone ) , while near the solar surface the small - scale magnetic buoyancy effect is important when the mean magnetic field is weak .",
    "these small - scale phenomena can be stronger than the large - scale magnetic pumping and magnetic buoyancy which are caused by the influence of the mean magnetic field on the stratified fluid flow .",
