    "developed by greenberg @xcite , nqa uses an expansion in on  shell asymptotic fields , known as the haag expansion @xcite , to solve the operator equations of motion .",
    "the method is particularly well suited for bound state problems since it describes bound states with the same number of kinematical variables as in non ",
    "relativistic theories while maintaining explicit lorentz invariance ( for theories in free space ) . a summary of applications of nqa can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently we have extended the nqa to finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "our work was based on the thermal field dynamics formalism of umezawa and collaborators @xcite , and was motivated by an application of nqa to the bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite .",
    "temperature and chemical potential were introduced simultaneously by applying a thermal bogoliubov transformation to each of the fermionic or bosonic field operators in the haag expansion . at the same time we defined a thermal vacuum state which is annihilated by each of the thermal annihilation operators .",
    "this takes care of the doubling of the hilbert space which characterizes the formalism of thermal field dynamics .",
    "furthermore , in the nqa one works only in the space of asymptotic field operators and therefore there is no need to specify the structure of this vacuum state .",

    "these results were recovered using only the first term in the haag expansion . in this work",
    "we take the second order terms in the haag expansion into account to solve the  t  hooft model beyond the mean field theory .",
    "although non  renormalizable and non  confining , the  t  hooft interaction incorporates the symmetries of qcd and naturally provides a mechanism for chiral symmetry breaking and resolves the @xmath7 problem @xcite .",
    "as is well known it also supports the formation of various kinds of condensates . among them",
    "are the color singlet chiral condensate ( @xmath8 ) which breaks chiral symmetry dynamically and generates a mass to the fermions and the color anti  triplet scalar diquark condensate ( @xmath9 ) which triggers color superconductivity at finite density @xcite .    in this work",

    "thus there are no @xmath35 states in free space and for @xmath149 its formation occurs only above a critical density the value of which depends on the input parameters .",
    "this implies that below this critical density there is no contribution to the solution of the ",
    "t  hooft model from the @xmath35 term in the haag expansion .",
    "we also find solutions for the @xmath35 width indicating that this is a resonant state in contrast to the @xmath3 state .",
    "the @xmath35 mass and its width are shown in figure  2a .    in the broken symmetry mode",
    "the @xmath35 mass peaks around @xmath116 = 0.2 gev and decreases monotonically until the phase transition point . beyond this point",
    "it increases almost linearly as in the @xmath3 case .",
    "we find that @xmath150 for all values of density in which there is a resonant @xmath35 state .",
    "however , the @xmath35 coupling constant is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the @xmath3 state as shown in figure  2b .",
    "in fact , @xmath124 does not become appreciable until @xmath116 @xmath140 0.2 gev and continuously increases with increasing density .",
    "since @xmath124 normalizes the @xmath35 amplitude this means that the contribution from the @xmath35 term in the haag expansion becomes important with increasing density but it will always be a correction to the dominant @xmath3 term .",
    "in this work we have constructed a solution to the  t  hooft interaction lagrangian valid for finite temperature and chemical potential beyond the mean field approximation . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that such a solution has been presented in the literature . in order to construct this solution",
    "we have used the nqa to quantum field theory involving the second order haag expansion in the one  loop approximation .",
    "we have only included the color 1 @xmath3 and color @xmath4 @xmath35 composite fields in our ansatz to the  t  hooft model .",
    "an improved solution may be obtained by adding all possible channels , both color singlet and non  singlet , allowed by the model lagrangian .",
    "our solution was obtained by solving the self ",
    "consistency equations for the @xmath3 and @xmath35 haag amplitudes .",
    "this has been accomplished by calculating the masses , widths and coupling constants of the @xmath3 and the @xmath35 states . at finite density and zero temperature",
    "we find that the @xmath3 is a stable bound state with a vanishing width while the @xmath35 is a resonant state with a finite width .",
    "the latter state is resonant because we have only included the @xmath2 channels in our model lagrangian .",
    "thus our model provides no mechanism to create a bound @xmath35 state .",
    "these properties of the @xmath3 and the @xmath35 states can also be calculated using the standard hartree ",
    " rpa approach .",
    "we stress that the advantage of using the nqa over the hartree  fock ",
    "rpa approach is that one can explicitly obtain a solution to the model field theory",
    ".    it would be interesting to apply our method to study the properties of a bound diquark state @xcite at finite @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this may be done by adding a color @xmath4 @xmath5 channel to our model and repeat the calculation presented here using the same ansatz .",
    "a vanishing diquark width would indicate a bound state just as in the case of the @xmath3 shown in figure  1a .",
    "in addition we can determine the color superconducting gap by calculating the off  diagonal hamiltonian and demanding that it vanishes .",
    "we hope to report on the outcome of this investigation in the near future .",
