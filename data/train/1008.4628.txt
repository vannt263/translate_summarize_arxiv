    "we consider the so - called translationally invariant massless nelson model in @xmath2 dimensions , which describes a quantum mechanical particle interacting with a quantized field of relativistic massless bosons @xcite .",
    "both , particle and field move in @xmath2 dimensions and we assume that @xmath3 .    the hamiltonian of this model will be denoted by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 denoting the coupling constant .",
    "the generators of translations in @xmath6 , which are also known as operator of total momentum , commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "this yields a direct integral decomposition of the hamiltonian @xmath7 with fiber hamiltonian @xmath8 , @xcite .",
    "this paper is devoted to the properties of the ground state energy @xmath9 as a function of the coupling constant @xmath10 and the total momentum @xmath11 .",
    "strictly speaking , one should refer to as the minimal energy , since in three dimensions the fiber hamiltonian does not have a ground state @xcite ( for non - relativistic qed see also  @xcite ) . on the basis of heuristic physical principles , @xmath12 should be twice continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of the origin , with positive second derivative .",
    "establishing these properties is technically difficult due to the fact that the ground state energy is at the bottom of the continuous spectrum . by rotation invariance @xmath13",
    "only depends on the absolute value of @xmath11 . using functional integrals",
    "one can show that @xmath12 has a global minimum at the origin , @xcite .",
    "frhlich showed in his thesis that the gradient of @xmath12 is lipschitz continuous @xcite , see also @xcite . using renormalization @xcite or iterated perturbation theory @xcite it was shown for non - relativistic qed , that @xmath12 is in a neighborhood of the origin a @xmath14function with positive second derivative",
    "; the same methods and results should apply for the nelson model as well .",
    "however , these results on the regularity do not go beyond @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper it is shown that @xmath13 is in a neighborhood of zero a real analytic function of @xmath10 as well as @xmath11 .",
    "we provide explicit analytic expansions of the ground state energy in powers of @xmath10 . from this expansion",
    "it follows that on any closed subinterval of @xmath15 and for sufficiently small values of the coupling constant , the ground state energy @xmath12 is a @xmath14function with positive second derivative .",
    "furthermore , we derive a convergent small - coupling expansion for the effective mass @xmath16 in powers of @xmath10 ( see @xcite for the study of the effective mass for the polaron and @xcite for non - relativistic qed ) .",
    "as is well known , nelson s model studied in this article is very close to the polaron model which is of considerable physical interest ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the literature on the polaron is enormous and a considerable part of it is concerned with the calculation of this effective mass ( see @xcite for reviews on this particular problem ) .",
    "some of the references most relevant to our approach for the calculation of @xmath17 are @xcite . in view of the importance of such calculations , we therefore present an explicit combinatorial convergent expansion for the effective mass , in the nelson model case .",
    "the method used in this article is a variant of the one introduced in  @xcite for the treatment of the massless spin - boson model .",
    "our method exploits the well known formula which relates the minimal energy to the vacuum expectation of the semigroup generated by the hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath18    using functional integration and a forest interpolation formula due to brydges , kennedy , abdesselam , and rivasseau ( bkar formula ) we analyze the right hand side of . the functional integral representation of the quantity @xmath19 essentially provides a mapping of the original model to a statistical mechanics model of interacting intervals on the real line .",
    "the right - hand side of then becomes the infinite volume limit of the pressure for this gas of intervals .",
    "the latter is then studied using a cluster expansion obtained from the bkar formula which decouples the two - body interactions of these intervals in a minimal way .",
    "namely , the formula can be viewed as a resummation in terms of trees of a sum over graphs with edges corresponding to the two - body interactions between intervals .",
    "this yields an explicit expansion of the minimal energy .",
    "we believe that the analyticity part of our result could alternatively be obtained using techniques based on operator theoretic renormalization , @xcite",
    ". however , the explicit expansion which we derive seems to be specific to the statistical mechanics methods employed in this paper .    to illustrate the methods used in this paper we shall first consider a harmonic oscillator coupled to a relativistic field of massless bosons",
    "this can be viewed as a didactic introduction to the full - fledged expansion in the translation invariant case .",
    "it will be shown that also for that harmonic oscillator model the ground state energy is an analytic function of the coupling constant @xmath10 and an explicit formula for the ground state energy will be derived .",
    "we note that the analyticity part of this result can in fact be deduced for a larger class of confining potentials , not just a harmonic oscillator potential , using the result of griesemer and hasler in @xcite .",
    "that result is based on operator theoretic renormalization and requires the hamiltonian to satisfy a mild ir - condition . by working in an ir - regular representation of the ccr , @xcite",
    ", the hamiltonian has sufficiently regular ir - behavior , for @xcite to be applicable , while its minimal energy remains unchanged ( we thank the referee for pointing this out to us )",
    ".    it would be interesting to further investigate whether the methods and estimates used in this paper can be extended to the renormalized nelson model , i.e. , where the ultraviolet cutoff is removed according to the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "below we introduce the model and state the results .",
    "the bosonic fock space is given by @xmath20 with vacuum vector @xmath21 over the hilbert space @xmath22 .",
    "by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , we denote the usual bosonic creation and annihilation operators in @xmath26 satisfying canonical commutation relations @xmath27=[a^*(k),a^*(k')]=0 , \\quad   [ a(k ) , a^*(k ' ) ] = \\delta(k - k ' ) , \\ ] ] and @xmath28 equations and are understood in the sense of distributions over @xmath6 .",
