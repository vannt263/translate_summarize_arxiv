    "undoped semiconductors have a small gap between the valence and the conduction band , typically of the order of @xmath0 ev @xcite .",
    "this gap is strongly affected by doping .",
    "in particular , sufficiently strong doping closes the gap such that a metallic phase appears .",
    "a classical example for this type of metal - insulator transition is doped silicon , where typical dopants are phosphorus ( si : p ) or boron ( si : b ) @xcite .",
    "disorder plays a crucial role in these materials due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the dopants .",
    "this suggested that anderson localization must play a crucial role in these systems , where the quantum states would undergo a transition from extended to localized states for increasing disorder .",
    "this transition should be reflected in the transport properties , where extended states lead to a metal and localized states to an insulator at vanishing temperatures .",
    "measurements of the conductivity @xmath1 as a function of doping concentration @xmath2 in si : p at low temperatures has indeed revealed a critical behavior . above a critical concentration @xmath3",
    "a power law was found @xmath4 and a vanishing conductivity for @xmath5 .",
    "the exponent @xmath6 was determined as @xmath7 for some experiments @xcite , whereas a crossover from @xmath7 at some distance from the critical point to @xmath8 in a vicinity very close to @xmath3 was observed in other experiments @xcite .",
    "although the picture of an anderson transition is quite appealing , an alternative description can be provided by a random gap model .",
    "the idea is that the dopants create energy levels inside the semiconductor gap .",
    "these levels are associated with states that can overlap with the states in the semiconductor bands and eventually fill the semiconductor gap by forming extended states .",
    "the effect can be described by a random distribution of local gaps .",
    "then the locally filled gaps can be distributed over the entire system and form eventually , after sufficient doping , a conducting `` network '' .",
    "this is associated with a second - order phase transition which will be described in this articles .",
    "the transition is distinguished from the anderson transition by the fact that the metallic phase appears at strong disorder ( i.e. high dopant concentration ) and the insulating phase at weak disorder .",
    "this does not rule out an anderson transition if we increase the disorder inside the metallic regime .",
    "however , in realistic systems it is more likely to see the transition caused by the random gap than the more sophisticated anderson transition .",

    "[ abelian0 ] in order to reveal the relevant symmetry for transport in this system , we construct the two - body hamiltonian @xmath22 where the upper block @xmath21 acts on bosons , the lower block @xmath21 on fermions .",
    "the reason for introducing this two - body hamiltonian is that we can transform the distribution of the random hamiltonian @xmath21 into a distribution of the green s function @xmath23 @xcite , which is often called a supersymmetric representation of the green s function @xcite .",
    "next we introduce the transformation matrix = [ chiral1a ] and obtain the anti - commutator relation _ + = 0  .",
    "[ relations3a ] this implies the non - abelian chiral symmetry e^uhe^u = h  , [ na_chirala ] which is an extension of the abelian symmetry ( [ abelian0 ] ) .",
    "the green s function @xmath24 does not obey this symmetry for @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 plays here the role of a symmetry - breaking field .",
    "an interesting limit is @xmath27 , which we will study in the next section .",
