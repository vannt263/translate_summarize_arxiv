    "after our reduction , we find that a net exposure time of 5.8  ks was achieved .",

    "this reduces the width of the heg extraction regions , with the effect of better selecting true first - order heg photons and enabling the extraction of spectra that carry out to 10  kev .",

    "add_grating_spectra _ was run to combine the first - order spectra and responses , and the ftool `` grppha '' was used to group the co - added first - order heg spectrum to require at least 10 counts per bin .",

    "this greatly diminishes the low energy flux from this source .",
    "owing to the lack of sensitivity at low energy , and also owing to chip gaps creating calibration uncertainties in the 34  kev range , our analysis was restricted to the combined heg spectrum and the 410  kev band .",
    "an initial fit to the spectrum with an absorbed disk blackbody model ( @xmath13 ; wilms et al .",

    "figure 1 depicts this simple model for the spectrum , as well as the data / model ratio , and deviations from the continuum as measured in units of @xmath17 .",
    "there is a broad flux excess above the continuum in the 5.56.5  kev range ; this is likely an fe k emission blurred by effects in the inner accretion disk .",
    "dai et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and cackett et al .",
    "( 2010 ) both detected this disk line in independent analyses .",
    "the most striking and significant feature , however , is an apparent absorption line at 6.9  kev .",
    "the addition of a gaussian model for this line improves the overall fit to @xmath18 .",
    "we performed 2000 monte carlo simulations of an absorbed disk spectrum with no line features .",
    "we fitted and conducted error bar searches on the resulting spectra with a model including a gaussian line ( emission or absorption ) _ anywhere _ in the 410 kev range .",
    "the detection of a line feature with equal or greater strength is 99.6% unlikely .",
    "this represents a conservative probability for a blind search ; in contrast , our search focused on the fe k band .",
    "the change in @xmath19 indicates a line significant at the @xmath20 level of confidence , as measured by an @xmath2-test . counting the number of resolution elements in the 6.77.3  kev band as independent trials , the significance is reduced to @xmath21 .",
    "the best - fit line energy is @xmath22 kev .",
    "the rest - frame energy of the he - like fe xxv resonance line is 6.700  kev , and the rest - frame energy of the h - like fe xxvi resonance line is 6.970  kev ( verner et al .",
    "thus , the line could represent absorption in a modest inflow , or in a strong outflow .",
    "there are weaker features in the 6.56.8  kev range and in the 7.07.5  kev range that may aid a self - consistent determination of whether the gas is an inflow or outflow .    to address this question , physical self - consistency is required ; line - by - line fitting is not sufficient .",
    "we therefore constructed a grid of xstar photoionized absorption models ( e.g. , kallman & bautista 2001 )",
    ". a turbulent velocity of @xmath23 and solar abundances were assumed . a nominal gas density of @xmath24 was also assumed .",
    "a covering factor must also be specified ; we selected @xmath25 based on examples of similar absorption in stellar - mass black holes ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2015 ) . based on the disk blackbody fit , an input spectrum with @xmath26  kev and a 230  kev luminosity of @xmath27 was assumed ( based on the unabsorbed flux and an assumed distance of 8.5  kpc ; see penninx et al .",
    "a grid of models spanning a broad range in column density and ionization was generated using the `` xstar2xspec '' , and included in our subsequent xspec fits as a multiplicative table model .",
    "when the grid is allowed to act on the blackbody continuum , it is a @xmath28 improvement over a model without the absorption , giving @xmath29 . in this fit , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "importantly , a blue - shift of @xmath32 is measured . a model wherein the flow",
    "is required to have either zero shift or a red - shift , is significantly worse : @xmath33 .",
    "this is true despite the fact that the ionization parameter moves up to @xmath34 , as expected if fe xxvi must be very strong relative to fe xxv .",
    "an f - test prefers the blue - shifted model over the zero - shift model at the @xmath35 level of confidence .",
    "this result does not depend on the interstellar column density ; the same blue - shift results when a value of @xmath36 is enforced ( though the overall fit is not as good ) .",
    "this indicates that the absorption is best associated with an rapid outflow . however , it is possible that the overall spectral model is still too simple .",
    "prior work has found evidence of a relativistic disk line in gx  340@xmath00 , and the broad flux excess in figure 1 appears to confirm this feature in the combined _",
    "chandra_/heg spectrum .",
    "we there added a simple relativistic line , `` diskline '' ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) , in the next model .",
    "`` diskline '' is characterized in terms of a line energy ( restricted to the 6.406.97  kev range for fe i  xxvi in our fits ) , an disk emissivity index ( @xmath37 , bounded to lie in the @xmath38 range ) , an inner disk radius ( measured in units of @xmath39 ) , an outer disk radius ( fixed at @xmath40 ) , the inner disk inclination ( bounded between @xmath41 ) and a flux normalization .",
    "a model consisting of @xmath42 improves the fit at the @xmath20 level of confidence , to @xmath43 .",
    "the absorption is not substantially changed , a blue - shift of @xmath44 is again measured ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "the measured diskline parameters include @xmath47  kev , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and a normalization of @xmath51 ( translating into an equivalent width of @xmath52  ev ) .",
    "this model is preferred over one including a disline but disallowing blue - shifts at the @xmath4 level of confidence ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "weak residuals remain in the fe k band , suggesting that the wind is more complex than our single - zone model .",
    "a model with three zones achieves only modest improvements in the fit statistic , giving @xmath54 .",
    "this fit accounts for weaker residuals in the fe k band , but also fits some apparent lines in the 45  kev band that can be associated with he - like ca xix and h - like ca xx ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "we regard this model as our best - fit model ; it is fully described in table 1 .",
    "the best model wherein all three components can not be blue - shifted gives @xmath55 ( a @xmath56 difference for a change of one free parameter ) ; the best three - component model wherein only one component is disallowed a blue - shift gives @xmath57 ( a @xmath58 difference for a change of one free parameter ) .",
    "the data do not require re - emission from the wind ; dynamical broadening of such emission can potentially give radius constraints ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "2015 , 2016 ) .",
    "winds do not have to be launched with the local escape speed ; rather , they can be accelerated continually , or once certain conditions obtain . however , within this framework , an outflow velocity of @xmath3 corresponds to a launching radius of @xmath59  cm ( assuming a neutron star of @xmath60 ) .",
    "the mass outflow rate in each component can be calculated by starting with the standard formula , @xmath61 .",
    "adjusting for a non - spherical flow , and writing in terms of number density , the equation becomes @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the covering factor , @xmath64 is the mean atomic weight , @xmath65 is the mass of the proton , and @xmath66 is the number density ) . using the ionization parameter ( recall , @xmath67 ) , it is possible to write the mass outflow rate without assuming a density : @xmath68 .",
    "the kinetic power in the outflow is then just @xmath69 .    for the fast @xmath3 component detected in gx  340@xmath00 , the mass outflow rate is @xmath70 , or @xmath71",
    "this is a very high mass flux ; the implied inflow rate at the inner disk is just @xmath72 , assuming an efficiency of @xmath73 .",
    "the implied power in the fast component is even more extreme : @xmath74 .",
    "this implies that the mechanical power exceeds the radiative eddington limit by a factor of 56 .",
    "the estimates can be interpreted as the mass outflow rate and kinetic power _ divided by the filling factor_. if the volume filling factor is , e.g. , @xmath75 ( commensurate with some agn ; see , e.g. , blustin et al .",
    "2005 ) , the actual outflow rate is sub - eddington and the mass outflow rate is also reduced in direct proportion . if the launching radius derived by associating the observed wind speed with a local escape velocity is used , a very high density value results ( @xmath76 ) , and @xmath77 implies @xmath78 .",
    "this would reduce the mass outflow rate and kinetic power in gx 340@xmath00 by four orders of magnitude .",
    "the mass outflow rate would then agree with the inferred mass accretion rate at the inner disk , to within a factor of a few .",
    "however , as noted above , there is no requirement that the observed wind speed is a local escape velocity .",
    "if the filling factor is not low , it may be the case that gx  340@xmath00 was observed in a super - eddington phase .",
    "we have analyzed an archival _ chandra_/hetg spectrum of the neutron star low - mass x - ray binary gx 340@xmath00 .",
    "the spectra reveal strong evidence of a single strong line close to 6.9  kev , and several weaker aborption lines .",
    "self - consistent photoionization modeling establishes that the feature is most likely produced in a complex disk wind , with a component that is blue - shifted by @xmath3 .",
    "even if the wind has a low volume filling factor , its mass outflow rate and kinetic power would still rank among the highest  or as _ the _ highest  yet detected from a neutron star or stellar - mass black hole . in this section , we discuss the physical processes by which the wind may be driven , and compare the outflow to extreme winds detected in other sources .",
    "disk winds detected in _",
    "observations of v404 cyg and igr j17091@xmath83634 may offer the best points of comparison for gx  340@xmath00 .",
    "the 2015 outburst of v404 cyg was particularly extreme , and it is possible that the mass accretion rate was highly super - eddington in some phases . in spectra of v404 cyg , the observed velocity shifts exceed @xmath79 and the implied mass outflow rate is approximately @xmath80 ( assuming a unity filling factor ; king et al .",
    "spectra of igr j17091@xmath83624 reveal a wind with two components , with speeds of @xmath81 and @xmath82 . here",
    "again , the total outflow rate would approach @xmath5 for a unity filling factor , but the filling factor may be of order @xmath83 ( king et al .  2012 ) .    if the filling factor of the wind in gx  340@xmath00 is not small , the outflow power may actually exceed the observed radiative luminosity .",
    "this would likely signal super - eddington accretion in gx  340@xmath00 .",
    "the wind would then be driven by electron scattering pressure .",
    "at least one ultra - luminous x - ray ( ulx ) source is powered by a neutron star ( bachetti et al .",
    "2014 ) , and population considerations suggest that a number of ulxs may harbor neutron stars ( king & lasota 2016 ) .",
    "however , a super - eddinton flow is difficult to reconcile with the detection of a relativistic disk line : the central engine should be blocked by a super - eddington photosphere . moreover ,",
    "the observed column density in the outflow is well below @xmath84 ( see table 1 ) .    unlike the disk winds that are typically observed in stellar - mass black holes , the wind in gx  340@xmath00 has components with an ionization parameter below @xmath85",
    "simulations have identified this as a threshold below which radiation pressure on lines can drive disk winds ( e.g. , proga 2003 ) . directly tapping into the radiative luminosity",
    "may help to explain why the outflow in gx  340@xmath00 has a high speed . in this sense",
    ", the observed wind may be similar to the extreme outflows in balqsos ( e.g. , arav et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in balqsos , however , geometric shielding is required to keep the gas from becoming over - ionized by x - rays .",
    "it is unclear how such shielding might be achieved in an x - ray binary , particularly when the relativistic emission line in this system indicates a clear view of the inner disk ( e.g. , dai et al .",
    "2009 , cackett et al .",
    ". it may be the case that a combination of mechanisms , plausibly including radiative pressure , thermal driving ( e.g. begelman et al .",
    "1983 ) , and magnetic processes ( e.g. blandford & payne 1982 ; proga 2003 ) act to drive the wind in gx  340@xmath00 .",
    "it is notable that the inclination angle of @xmath86 indicated by the relativistic line , is commensurate with the optimal angle for driving magnetocentrifugal winds ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the 1.512.0  kev _",
    "rxte_/asm light curve of gx  340@xmath00 , spanning intervals near the observation in which we have detected a strong wind , and two subsequent _ chandra _ observations that appear to lack strong absorption .",
    "the wind is detected in the observation with the lowest flux , though the level is only 1020% below the observations lacking wind absorption .",
    "hardness ratios might reveal more information , but the asm ratios are insensitive owing to the very high column density along the line of sight to gx  340@xmath00 . triggered observations based on maxi light curves and hardness ratios",
    "may be able to reveal links between the state of the disk and wind production in gx  340@xmath00 .",
