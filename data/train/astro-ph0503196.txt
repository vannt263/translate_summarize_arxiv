    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) show that the universe at cosmic recombination ( redshift @xmath1 ) was remarkably uniform apart from spatial fluctuations in the energy density and in the gravitational potential of roughly one part in @xmath2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the primordial inhomogeneities in the density distribution grew over time and eventually led to the formation of galaxies as well as galaxy clusters and large - scale structure .",
    "different physical processes contributed to the perturbation growth ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the absence of other influences , gravitational forces due to density perturbations imprinted by inflation would have driven parallel perturbation growth in the dark matter , baryons and photons . however , since the photon sound speed is of order the speed of light , the radiation pressure produced sound waves on a scale of order the horizon and suppressed sub - horizon perturbations in the photon density .",
    "the baryonic pressure similarly suppressed perturbations in the gas below the much smaller baryonic jeans scale .",
    "since the formation of hydrogen at recombination had decoupled the cosmic gas from its mechanical drag on the cmb , the baryons subsequently began to fall into the pre - existing gravitational potential wells of the dark matter .",
    "spatial fluctuations developed in the gas temperature as well as in the gas density .",
    "both the baryons and the dark matter were affected on small scales by the temperature fluctuations through the gas pressure .",
    "compton heating due to scattering of the residual free electrons ( constituting a fraction @xmath3 ) with the cmb photons remained effective , keeping the gas temperature fluctuations tied to the photon temperature fluctuations , even for a time after recombination . in prior analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the standard cmbfast code @xcite a spatially uniform speed of sound was assumed for the gas at each redshift .",
    "this assumption meant that the gas temperature distribution at any given time was assumed to be simply proportional to its density distribution .",
    "while this assumption can be accurately invoked before recombination , when the gas is thermally and mechanically coupled to the radiation , and in the absence of heating would be accurate after recombination ( i.e. , for an adiabatic gas ) , this assumption is in fact inaccurate during the post - recombination era due to the continual compton heating .",
    "a full calculation of the temperature fluctuations is essential for obtaining accurate results for the small - scale density power spectra of both the baryons and ( to a lesser degree ) the dark matter ( see also @xcite and @xcite , who considered the effect of a varying sound speed on density perturbations ) . note that whether we discuss perturbations driven by gravity or sound waves driven by pressure gradients , we in every case refer to @xmath4 as the square of the sound speed of the fluid , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the pressure and density perturbations , respectively .",
    "the primordial inhomogeneities in the cosmic gas induced variations in the optical depth for absorption of the cmb at the redshifted 21 cm wavelength of neutral hydrogen .",
    "therefore , the hyperfine spin flip transition of neutral hydrogen is potentially the most promising tracer of the cosmic gas in the era before the first galaxies .",
    "future observations of the redshifted @xmath7 power spectrum as a function of wavelength and angular direction should provide a three - dimensional map of the distribution of neutral hydrogen @xcite , where redshift supplies the line - of - sight distance . at different redshifts ,",
    "different signal characteristics are expected , according to the evolution of density fluctuations and the thermal history of the cosmic gas .",
    "@xcite explored the consequences of the varying baryonic sound speed for the evolution of perturbations on sub - horizon large - scale structure scales ( wavevectors @xmath840 mpc@xmath9 ) in the redshift range @xmath10150 , where the analysis involves only gravity ; they showed that observations of 21 cm fluctuations at these redshifts can measure five easily - separated fluctuation modes . in this paper",
    "we extend the redshift range back to cosmic recombination , we consider the largest scales (  2 ) where general relativity and photon fluctuations play a role , and we also study the smallest scales (  3 ) where gas pressure has an essential effect .",
    "this allows us to study the evolution of temperature fluctuations on all scales , and to produce the first accurate predictions at @xmath11 mpc@xmath9 of the baryonic density power spectrum and ( in  4 & 5 ) of 21 cm fluctuations .",
    "we also calculate (  5 ) a general feature of the 21 cm fluctuation power spectrum , i.e. , smoothing by the thermal width of the 21 cm absorption line .",
    "we give our conclusions in  6 .",
    "up to recombination the baryons and the photons were tightly coupled , and afterwards the baryons were significantly compton heated down to @xmath12 and retained some memory of this heating at even lower redshifts .",
    "thus , calculations of the growth of perturbations in the baryon density and temperature must take into consideration the evolution of the photon density and temperature fluctuations .",
    "the perturbations in the photons themselves ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are not significantly affected by the baryon temperature since the photon pressure dominates strongly over the baryonic pressure .",
    "if we define the photon temperature @xmath13 at each point as the temperature averaged over all photon directions , then dimensionless fluctuations in this temperature ( @xmath14 ) are related to photon density fluctuations ( @xmath15 ) by @xmath16 we can derive an equation for the evolution of fluctuations @xmath17 in the gas temperature @xmath18 from the first law of thermodynamics [ following the derivation by @xcite ] : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the heating rate per particle and @xmath21 is the baryon density . in the post - recombination era before the formation of galaxies , the only external heating arises from thomson scattering of the remaining free electrons with cmb photons , resulting in a heating rate per particle @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath24 is the photon energy density , and @xmath25 is the electron fraction out of the total number density of gas particles at time @xmath26 .",
    "after cosmic recombination , @xmath25 changes due to the slow recombination rate of the residual ions : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mean number density of hydrogen at time @xmath26 , @xmath29 is the helium to hydrogen number density ratio , and @xmath30 is the case - b recombination coefficient of hydrogen .",
    "we assume that the residual electron fraction is uniform .",
    "fluctuations in @xmath31 are expected to be very small , since the gas in every region starts out fully ionized and the final @xmath31 depends on the total accumulated number of recombinations ; most recombinations occur early during cosmic recombination , and the recombination rate slows down greatly once most of the gas has recombined , making @xmath31 insensitive at that point to the gas density and temperature .",
    "e.g. , since the cosmic mean @xmath31 declines by only a factor of 1.3 between @xmath32 and 20 , we estimate that in this redshift range , fluctuations in @xmath31 are smaller than density fluctuations by a factor of @xmath33 .    combining equations  ( [ ther ] ) and ( [ h_rate ] ) we obtain @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the scale factor .",
    "thus the evolution of the cosmic mean gas temperature is @xmath37 where @xmath38/a$ ] is the mean cmb temperature , and the first - order equation for the perturbation is @xmath39 the first term on the right - hand - side of each of these two equations accounts for adiabatic expansion of the gas , and the remaining terms capture the effect of the thermal exchange with the cmb .",
    "we have numerically calculated the evolution of the perturbations by modifying the cmbfast code @xcite according to these equations for the temperature perturbations ( along with other modifications on small scales that are described in the next section ) .",
    "the initial conditions for the temperature at @xmath40 are @xmath41 because of the tight thermal coupling between the gas and the cmb . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the mechanical coupling weakens but the thermal coupling remains strong , i.e. , the coefficient of the coupling term in equation  ( [ gamma ] ) remains very large , and it is numerically highly inefficient to solve this equation directly .",
    "we instead develop a simple approximation that may be used during this era of thermal tight coupling .",
    "first we write the expression for @xmath42 using equation  ( [ gamma ] ) along with the expression for @xmath43 as computed by cmbfast . as long as the thermal coupling is effective",
    ", the difference @xmath44 is very small , i.e. , @xmath45 , so that the various terms in the expression for @xmath46 must cancel each other nearly completely .",
    "since this expression depends on @xmath47 [ see the right - hand side of equation  ( [ gamma ] ) ] , we simply set @xmath47 to the value that yields @xmath48 .",
    "we have checked that using this approximation down to @xmath49 affects the power spectra by a fraction of a percent at most .    for the concordance set of cosmological parameters @xcite , with a scale - invariant primordial power spectrum normalized to @xmath50 at @xmath51 , figure  [ fig : photons ]",
    "compares the magnitude of the fluctuations in the cdm and baryon densities , and in the baryon and photon temperatures . for each quantity ,",
    "the plot shows the dimensionless combination @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath53 is the corresponding power spectrum of fluctuations .",
    "note that regions where the fluctuations oscillate in sign ( as a function of @xmath54 ) are difficult to show precisely in such a plot ( e.g. , the photons and baryons at @xmath81 mpc@xmath9 at @xmath55 , and the baryon temperature at @xmath56 mpc@xmath9 at @xmath57 ) .",
    "note also that the photon temperature perturbations as shown are simply @xmath58 of the photon density perturbations [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ] .",
    "after recombination , two main forces affect the baryon density and temperature fluctuations , namely , the thermalization with the cmb and the gravitational force that attracts the baryons to the dark matter potential wells . as shown in the figure , the density perturbations in all species grow together [ except that @xmath59 on scales where gravity is unopposed , outside the horizon ( i.e. , at @xmath60 mpc@xmath9 at @xmath61 ) . at @xmath55 the perturbations in the baryon - photon fluid",
    "oscillate as acoustic waves on scales of order the sound horizon ( @xmath62 ) , while smaller - scale perturbations in both the photons and baryons are damped by photon diffusion ( silk damping ) and the drag of the diffusing photons on the baryons .",
    "since the initial dark matter density perturbations increase with @xmath54 , while the photon perturbations are damped on the smallest scales by photon free streaming , on sufficiently small scales the power spectra of @xmath63 and @xmath47 roughly assume the shape of the dark matter fluctuation @xmath64 ( except for the gas - pressure cutoff at the smallest scales ) , due to the effect of gravitational attraction on @xmath63 and of the resulting adiabatic expansion on @xmath47 .",
    "this evolution involves two similar physical systems . in each case , a target perturbation @xmath65 is driven toward one perturbation @xmath66 , but this forcing is opposed by coupling to a second perturbation @xmath67 .",
    "the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are comparable on large scales but @xmath68 on small scales . as long as the coupling is strong",
    ", @xmath69 on large scales , while the effect of @xmath66 is apparent in the form of @xmath65 on small scales although the coupling maintains @xmath70 .",
    "after the coupling weakens , the perturbation @xmath65 is free to begin rising toward @xmath66 , but this rise occurs only gradually . in the first case , @xmath71 is driven by gravity toward @xmath72 , while mechanical coupling to @xmath73 is the opposing force . in the second case",
    ", @xmath74 is driven by adiabatic expansion toward @xmath75 , with resistance provided by thermal coupling to @xmath76 .",
    "the mechanical coupling ends at @xmath61 while the thermal coupling is over by @xmath77 .",
    "the figure also shows that the thermal tight - coupling approximation is accurate at the highest redshifts shown , on large scales since @xmath78 , while on small scales @xmath47 and @xmath14 are not strongly coupled but each is individually very small compared to @xmath63 . even at somewhat lower redshifts , @xmath79 and @xmath80 on sub - horizon scales .",
    "by @xmath81 the baryon infall into the dark matter potentials is well advanced and adiabatic expansion is becoming increasingly important in setting the baryon temperature . by this redshift ,",
    "the photon perturbations are already negligible at @xmath82 mpc@xmath9 , justifying their neglect by @xcite on these scales .",
    "on small scales ( i.e. , at large wavenumbers ) the baryon perturbation growth is affected by the pressure of the gas , which affects the dark matter as well since the baryons contribute a small but significant fraction of the total gravitational force .",
    "the evolution of sub - horizon linear perturbations is described by two coupled second - order differential equations .",
    "the dark matter feels the combined gravity of itself and the baryons : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the redshift zero matter density as a fraction of the critical density .",
    "the baryons feel both gravity and pressure .",
    "prior analyses assumed a spatially uniform baryonic sound speed @xmath85 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yielding @xmath86 where @xmath87 was calculated from the thermal evolution of a uniform gas undergoing hubble expansion : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "this also meant that the gas temperature fluctuation was assumed to be proportional throughout space to the density fluctuation , so that @xmath90 in this paper we instead use the equation of state of an ideal gas to derive a more general equation for the baryons , @xmath91 note that during recombination , we make a similar correction of the baryonic pressure force in the equations of cmbfast . in order to solve for the density perturbations , an evolution equation for the fluctuations in the temperature",
    "is also required . on sub - horizon scales and at @xmath12",
    "we can neglect the perturbations in the temperature and density of the photons in equation  ( [ gamma ] ) , yielding simply @xmath92 equations  ( [ chi ] ) , ( [ mean ] ) , ( [ eq : dm ] ) , ( [ eq : b ] ) and ( [ delta_t ] ) are a closed set of equations describing the evolution of density and temperature perturbations .",
    "we note that @xcite derived a similar equation to eq.([eq : indian ] ) but solved it only for the case of a density perturbation that follows the einstein - de sitter growing mode @xmath93 and thus neglected spatial variations in the speed of sound .",
    "figure  [ fig : p ] shows the power spectra at redshift @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "as time passes , the power spectrum of the baryons approaches that of the dark matter except for the pressure cutoff , and the baryon temperature fluctuations increase as well .",
    "however , even during the era of the formation of the first galaxies ( @xmath9620 ) , there is still significant memory in the perturbations of their earlier coupling to the cmb .",
    "this is highlighted in figure  [ fig : f_z ] , which shows the ratios @xmath97 and @xmath98 . in both quantities , the strong oscillations that are apparent at @xmath57 are slowly smoothed out toward lower redshifts . at the largest scales ,",
    "the baryons follow the dark matter density , and @xmath99 evolves from @xmath100 ( the value during tight thermal coupling to the cmb ) to @xmath101 ( from adiabatic expansion ) . on smaller scales ,",
    "the two ratios start from values @xmath102 during mechanical / thermal coupling , and increase towards @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively .",
    "the former ratio approaches its asymptotic value earlier , since the baryons decouple from the photons first mechanically and only later thermally . at the smallest scales ( below the baryonic jeans scale ) , the baryon fluctuation is suppressed at all redshifts due to gas pressure , when the @xmath105 term in equation  ( [ eq : b ] ) dominates .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the traditional assumption of @xmath106 being independent of scale is inaccurate at all redshifts considered here .         and @xmath98 vs.  comoving wavenumber .",

    "although the improved calculation has only a small effect on the dark matter density ( @xmath112 ) and a similarly small effect on the baryon density at @xmath113 mpc@xmath9 , on smaller scales the baryon fluctuations are substantially affected .",
    "the baryon fluctuations are changed by up to @xmath114 at @xmath32 and @xmath115 at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , accurate initial conditions for models and simulations of the formation of the first galaxies require a full calculation of the evolution of baryon density and temperature fluctuations along with the dark matter .",
    "quantitative calculations of @xmath7 absorption begin with the spin temperature @xmath116 , defined through the ratio between the number densities of hydrogen atoms , @xmath117 where subscripts @xmath118 and @xmath119 correspond to the excited and ground state levels of the 21 cm transition , @xmath120 is the ratio of the spin degeneracy factors of the levels , and @xmath121k corresponds to the energy difference between the levels .",
    "the 21 cm spin temperature is on the one hand radiatively coupled to the cmb temperature , and on the other hand coupled to the kinetic gas temperature @xmath18 through collisions @xcite or the absorption of ly@xmath122  photons @xcite . for the concordance set of cosmological parameters @xcite ,",
    "the mean brightness temperature on the sky at redshift @xmath123 ( relative to the cmb itself ) is @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the mean neutral fraction of hydrogen .    in general , fluctuations in @xmath126",

    "we consider the era before the formation of a significant galaxy population , so that @xmath127 and there is no ly@xmath122  flux .",

    "this is due to the finite width of the @xmath7 absorption line , set by a combination of the natural linewidth and the thermal motions of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "the resulting cutoff in the power spectrum was estimated crudely by @xcite , but here we calculate it precisely along with its angular dependence . note that this cutoff arises from the use of an absorption line as a probe , and is a separate effect from the jeans smoothing of the density discussed above .",

    "the parameter @xmath167 measures the relative importance of the natural compared to the thermal line width , and its extremely low value , @xmath168 , indicates that the natural width is in practice negligible .",
    "we note that collisional broadening is expected to dominate over the natural broadening , but even collisions with other atoms , which contribute the highest collision rate , produce broadening that is greater than the natural width by only a few orders of magnitude , and this is still negligible relative to the thermal broadening .",

    "we conclude that accurate initial conditions for analytical models and numerical simulations of galaxy formation require a full calculation of the evolution of perturbations that includes the spatial fluctuations in the baryonic sound speed . at high",
    "redshift the gas temperature fluctuations are still recovering from their thermal coupling to the photons and are quite small at sub - horizon scales ; thus , our improved calculation is particularly important for simulations of the formation of the first galaxies .",
