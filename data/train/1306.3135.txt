    "manipulation of a single electron spin with the application of gate controlled electric fields in a confined semiconductor qds is a promising way for developing spin based quantum logic gates , spin memory devices for various quantum information processing applications .",

    "@xcite when a qubit is operated on by a classical bit , then its decay time is given by a spin relaxation time which is also supposed to be longer than the minimum time required to execute one quantum gate operation .",

    "@xcite balocchi et .",
    "@xcite have recently measured larger spin relaxation times ( @xmath0 ) in gaas qds .",
    "more specifically , both isotropic and anisotropic spin relaxations can be tuned with spin orbit coupling by choosing the growth direction parallel to the crystallographic axis [ 001 ] , [ 110 ] and [ 111 ] of iii - v zinc blend semiconductor qds .",
    "@xcite in addition to the lengthening spin coherence time , the electric field tuning of spin relaxation forms the basis for turning the spin current on and off in some spin transistor proposals that can help to initialize electron spin based quantum computers .",
    "@xcite these experimental studies confirm that the manipulation of spin - flip rates mediated by phonons due to spin - orbit coupling is an important ingredient for the design of robust spintronics logic devices .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling is mainly dominated by the rashba  @xcite and the linear dresselhaus  @xcite terms in iii - v semiconductor qds .",
    "@xcite the rashba spin - orbit coupling arises from structural inversion asymmetry along the growth direction while the dresselhaus spin - orbit coupling arises from the bulk inversion asymmetry of the crystal lattice .",

    "the cusp like structure implies shorter spin relaxation and decoherence time which is hazardous for spin based applications such as quantum logic gates , solid state quantum computing and quantum information processing . for these applications ,",
    "the spin - hot spot in the phonon mediated spin relaxation rate is something to avoid during the design of qd spin based transistors .",
    "very recently , the authors in ref .   measured the spin - hot spot in the phonon mediated spin relaxation rate in silicon qds with the application of tuning very weak spin orbit coupling when zeeman energy and valley splittings induce degeneracy . at the spin - hot spot in silicon qds , the dramatic rate enhancement decreases the decoherence time which is not supposed to be the ideal location for the qubit operation .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we obtain new analytical and numerical results for the behavior of the spin relaxation rate in anisotropic iii - v semiconductor qds . for the first time",
