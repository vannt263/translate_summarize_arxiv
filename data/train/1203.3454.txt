    "the threading and slicing approaches lead to restrictions on coordinate systems that may be used to cover the spacetime manifold .",
    "the threading coordinate conditions can be invariantly included in the geometric structure of einstein s theory , so that _ all _ spacetime coordinate systems must obey these _ standard _ threading admissibility conditions .",
    "the situation is different with the slicing coordinate conditions ; in general , they simply impose additional restrictions on coordinate systems so as to exclude causality violation via closed timelike curves .",
    "it is interesting to study the influence of chronology violation on wave propagation .",
    "in fact , huygens principle assumes at the outset that coordinate time monotonically increases along the wavefront .",
    "therefore , wave motion may exhibit some unusual features in chronology violating universes .",
    "a complete treatment of this topic is beyond the scope of this paper ; however , we explore here some of the consequences of the absence of a cosmic time coordinate for wave motion in a gravitational field .",
    "in particular , we study wave propagation parallel to the axis of rotation of stationary gdel - type universes .    geometrical units ( @xmath22 ) will be used hereafter .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section ii , spacetime splitting is discussed in a gravitational field .",
    "the resulting conditions on the admissibility of coordinates are examined in section iii .",
    "some aspects of wave motion in certain gdel - type universe models are treated in sections iv - vi .",
    "section vii contains a discussion of our results .",
    "the _ fundamental observers _ in a gravitational field are those at rest in space .",
    "these static observers are naturally connected to a coordinate system .",
    "all other observers are pointwise related to the fundamental observers by lorentz transformations .",
    "imagine a fundamental observer with four - velocity @xmath23 in an arbitrary gravitational field , as depicted in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "in general , such an observer is accelerated . the spacetime interval along its trajectory ",
    "namely , where @xmath24 , for @xmath25denotes its proper time , @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , its orthogonal subspace @xmath28 represents its local rest space and is such that @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",

    "ij = g_ij- .",
    "it follows from the inverse relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath1 that @xmath34 and @xmath35 are inverse of each other ; similarly , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are also inverse of each other , where [ 5 ] ^ij= g^ij- .",
    "the threading approach thus leads to the following coordinate admissibility conditions [ 6 ] g_tt<0,(_ij)=. given a system of coordinates that uniquely identify events in a spacetime region , the standard threading admissibility conditions have to do with the possibility of existence of hypothetical static observers at all events in that region .",
    "we recall that a real symmetric matrix @xmath38 is positive definite if and only if there exists a real invertible matrix @xmath39 such that @xmath40 . thus if @xmath38 is a positive definite matrix , then so is its inverse ; of course , this can also be seen immediately from the positivity of all of their eigenvalues .",
    "it follows , for instance , that for a positive definite matrix @xmath41 , @xmath42 can be expressed in matrix notation as @xmath43 , which is manifestly positive , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "the measurement of spatial distance between a fundamental observer and an arbitrary nearby observer by means of light signals , as well as the synchronization of their clocks , has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; indeed , it is demonstrated there that the element of spatial distance , @xmath45 , as calculated here , @xmath46 , coincides with the radar distance  @xcite .",
    "imagine an _",

    "thus the slicing approach leads to the following coordinate admissibility conditions [ 8 ] g^tt<0,(^ij)=.    these conditions ensure that in the coordinate patch under consideration _ coordinate time increases monotonically along any timelike curve_. in particular , the application of these conditions to a bundle of fundamental observers implies that in such coordinate systems , @xmath9 monotonically increases along the world line of a fundamental observer . _",

    ". the infinitesimal constant - time hypersurfaces @xmath48 should all be spacelike .",
    "thus their normal vector field should be timelike .",
    "the hypersurfaces slice up this spacetime region ; therefore , this is the slicing approach to the splitting of spacetime into space plus time ( 3 + 1 \" ) .",
    "note that @xmath56 and the temporal coordinate monotonically increases along such a congruence . ]      in the threading approach , the lapse and shift functions are respectively @xmath57 and @xmath58 given by m=,m_i=- .",
    "then , we have for metric   the equivalent representation [ thd2 ] -ds^2=-m^2(dt - m_idx^i ) ( dt - m_jdx^j ) + _ ij dx^i dx^j,_ij = g_ij+m^2m_im_j . the form of metric ( [ thd2 ] ) is adapted to static observers with @xmath59-velocity u=_t , u^=-m(dt - m_idx^i ) , where the  flat \" symbol ( @xmath60 ) denotes the fully covariant form of a tensor .",
    "in fact , [ thd3 ] -ds^2=-(u_dx^)^2+_ij dx^i dx^j .    in a similar way",
    ", one may introduce the lapse - shift notation in the slicing approach , namely , n=,n^i=- .",
    "normalizing @xmath61 , so that it becomes a vector of unit length @xmath62 , we have n=-(_t -n^i _ i ) , n^=ndt .",
    "thus in the slicing approach , eq .",
    "can be expressed in terms of @xmath63 and @xmath64 in a manner that is completely analogous to the threading approach , namely , @xmath65 however , a closer examination reveals that this formal duality does _ not _ extend to the physical conditions contained in eqs .   and  .",
    "at any event @xmath66 on the spacetime manifold , we have a tangent space @xmath67 of vectors at @xmath66 as well as the dual space @xmath68 of one - forms at @xmath66 with corresponding expressions of the metric tensor given respectively by eqs .   and  .",
    "at @xmath66 , the symmetric matrix @xmath0 can be diagonalized , so that @xmath69 , where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , is an orthogonal matrix and @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , for @xmath75 .",
    "thus by means of a local transformation and a certain scaling , @xmath0 at each point @xmath66 can be reduced to @xmath76 .",
    "furthermore , we have that at @xmath66 , @xmath77 , where the diagonal elements of @xmath78 respect the metric signature , as before . in a similar way",
    ", @xmath1 can be reduced to @xmath79 at @xmath66 .",
    "this pointwise duality thus stays at the threading level and does _ not _ extend to the slicing approach .",
    "that is , the conditions given in eq .",
    "are in general different from those given in eq .",
    ", as can be seen via explicit examples discussed in section iv .",
    "the coordinate conditions   that result from the threading approach can be naturally incorporated into the underlying geometric framework of general relativity ; however , the slicing conditions   can be neither invariantly formulated nor are they sufficiently local to become part of the structure of lorentzian geometry . indeed ,",
    "all coordinate patches in which the metric takes the form @xmath80 , where @xmath81 can be treated as a small perturbation  such as in the riemann normal coordinates about any event or the fermi normal coordinates about the world line of an observer  satisfy both conditions   and  . while coordinate systems that are compatible with conditions   protect chronology",
    ", this does not mean that chronology violation does not occur in the gravitational field under consideration .",
    "in fact , general relativity per se does not require the existence of a cosmic time , as conditions   can not be woven into the fabric of lorentzian geometry @xcite . from this viewpoint ,",
    "general relativity must be abandoned if one insists on integrating the slicing coordinate conditions into the foundations of the theory of gravitation .",
    "the threading and slicing approaches and their respective restrictions on coordinate charts have been discussed in one form or another by a number of authors .",
    "we should mention in particular the work of zelmanov  @xcite , cattaneo  @xcite , mller  @xcite and lichnerowicz  @xcite , among others .",
    "a historical review is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "following synge  @xcite , we refer to the combined threading and slicing conditions as the lichnerowicz admissibility requirements ( see the theorem on page 9 of ref .",
    "the book of landau and lifshitz  @xcite contains a particularly clear discussion of the standard admissibility requirements .",
    "it is a theorem of linear algebra  @xcite that a real symmetric @xmath82 matrix @xmath83 is _ positive definite _ if and only if the _ principal minors _ of @xmath83 are all positive .",
    "these are @xmath84 scalars defined by , k=1 ,  , n. now consider the standard threading admissibility conditions .",
    "these involve the matrix @xmath85 : @xmath27 and @xmath86 must form a positive definite matrix . therefore , ( _ ij)= must be such that _",
    "11>0,_11_22-_12 ^ 2>0 , ( _ ij)>0 .",
    "note that @xmath27 and @xmath87 together imply that g_tt  _",
    "11=det < 0 .",
    "next , @xmath88 , when written out in detail , can be expressed as =   det .",
    "similarly , one finds that ( see appendix a ) [ a6 ] det(_ij)=  det ( g _ ) .    putting all these results together",
    ", we find that _ the standard threading admissibility conditions are equivalent to the statement that the principal minors of @xmath85 must all be negative for our @xmath89 signature .",
    "that is @xmath85 must be a negative definite matrix .",
    "similarly , the slicing admissibility conditions imply that @xmath90 must be a negative definite matrix .",
    "the lichnerowicz admissibility conditions then require that both @xmath85 and @xmath90 be negative definite matrices , i.e. , all their principal minors must be negative .",
    "_    in many spacetimes of interest in general relativity , lichnerowicz conditions reduce to the standard admissibility conditions ; indeed , most solutions of einstein s equations are of this type  @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for the kerr metric in the standard boyer - lindquist coordinates _ outside the static limit _ ; however , ctcs occur in the region interior to the inner event horizon .",
    "moreover , geodesic coordinate systems established along the world line of an accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime are such that the threading and slicing conditions coincide  @xcite ; somewhat similar results are expected for _ radar coordinates _  @xcite .",
    "the important point here is that lichnerowicz conditions exclude ctcs , whereas the standard coordinate conditions do not in general exclude them . much has been written about ctcs and time travel in general relativity ",
    "see , for example ,  @xcite , the recent review  @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "consider the propagation of test radiation in a coordinate patch containing a ctc .",
    "the ctc might leave an imprint on waves propagating in such a spacetime domain and such a trace could then be observationally detectable . in this connection",
    ", it appears useful to study wave phenomena in spacetimes with ctcs .",
    "consider , for example , a massless field propagating in a spacetime region with a _ closed null geodesic_. in the wkb approximation , we can imagine a wave packet moving essentially along the closed null geodesic , since in the wkb limit , massless wave propagation reduces to null geodesic motion .",
    "an examination of this situation reveals that the wave would appear to get immediately reflected : if the wave is initially moving forward in time , its spatial direction of propagation gets reversed when it starts to move backward in time .",
    "a similar result is expected for massive fields .",
    "we recall that a wave with propagation vector @xmath91 in an inertial frame of reference is , up to a certain amplitude function , of the form @xmath92 , so that as @xmath9 increases , @xmath93 increases along the wave vector @xmath94 as the wave travels forward ; however , if @xmath9 decreases , the wave travels in the @xmath95 direction .",
    "when the direction of the arrow of time reverses , the wave appears to suffer a reflection .",
    "thus we expect some unusual features for wave phenomena in gravitational fields that do not have a global time coordinate",
    ".    consider , for instance , the propagation of waves in the exterior kerr spacetime  @xcite ; in fact , there is absorption of radiation through the horizon in this case , but the scattering process contains little information about the ctcs that exist in the _ interior _ kerr spacetime .",
    "thus we must concentrate on wave propagation in regions where the ctcs are accessible .",
    "an ideal case would be the gdel universe  @xcite , which is free of horizons and singularities .",
    "do waves propagating in the gdel universe exhibit such an imprint  @xcite ?",
    "in fact , the elucidation of this issue originally motivated the preliminary analysis presented in this paper and , as will become clear below , its complete treatment remains a task for the future .",
    "the metric of gdel s universe in the original quasi - cartesian coordinates can be written as [ godel_cart ] -ds^2=-dt^2 - 2udtdy+dx^2-u^2 dy^2+dz^2,u = e^x , where @xmath96 is the frequency of universal rotation and @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 are three of the five killing vectors of this spacetime .",
    "the determinant of the metric turns out to be @xmath100 and the inverse metric is thus given by [ invgodel ] -(_s)^2=(_t)^2 - 2u^-1(_t)(_y)+(_x)^2+u^-2(_y)^2+(_z)^2 .",
    "the fundamental observers follow geodesics of metric  ; in fact , their four - velocity @xmath23 is given by @xmath101 , so that we have @xmath102 the source of gdel s solution of the einstein field equations is dust of constant energy density @xmath103 , with fluid unit four - velocity aligned with the time coordinate lines , and cosmological constant @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath96 describes an intrinsic counterclockwise rotation of the universe around the @xmath105 axis .",
    "the threading conditions are satisfied by metric  , while it is clear from the inverse metric   that @xmath106 .",
    "indeed , the slicing coordinate conditions do not hold and the original gdel coordinates are therefore not admissible in the sense of lichnerowicz .    in  @xcite , exact fermi normal coordinates were first explicitly introduced along the world line of a fiducial fundamental observer in gdel spacetime .",
    "imposing lichnerowicz conditions on these fermi coordinates limits their domain of applicability to the interior of a cylindrical region of radius @xmath107 about the axis of rotation  @xcite .",
    "this boundary cylinder consists of closed null curves beyond which ctcs exist .",
    "propagation of test electromagnetic radiation in the gdel universe was first investigated in  @xcite with the express purpose of demonstrating the coupling of photon spin with the essentially uniform gravitomagnetic field of this rotating universe .",
    "the formal simplicity of the gdel metric made it possible to find the exact solution of the perturbation equations and thus establish the gravitational coupling of the helicity of the photon to the rotation of the gdel universe . to solve maxwell s equations ,",
    "it was deemed convenient to use the skrotskii method , which is based on the analogy between a gravitational field and an optical medium  @xcite , and replace the gdel field with an effective gyrotopic medium . as is well known , in the treatment of electrodynamics in arbitrary spacetime",
    "coordinates , it is always possible to introduce instead a certain hypothetical medium with definite constitutive properties that occupies minkowski spacetime in quasi - cartesian coordinates  @xcite ; in fact , this method is conceptually related to weyl s formulation of fermat s principle in general relativity and to gordon s optical metric  @xcite .",
    "the physical description of photon helicity states is straightforward in scattering situations involving asymptotically flat spacetimes , but requires special care in universe models that are not asymptotically flat .",
    "for instance , in the gdel universe this connection is established via the limit as @xmath108 and gdel spacetime reduces to minkowski spacetime .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the spectrum of electromagnetic wave perturbations of the gdel universe would contain certain discreteness properties in close analogy with the landau spectrum of charged particles in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "out of the complete spectrum of finite perturbations , there is a part that satisfies these various physical requirements and only this part of the full spectrum was given in  @xcite without providing details of the selection process .",
    "the preferred part of the spectrum involves wave vectors whose magnitudes are sufficiently large compared to @xmath109 , corresponding to a pulse of radiation produced by a localized source . from this solution one",
    "finds , in addition to the spin - rotation - gravity coupling , that _ waves can not propagate parallel to the direction of rotation of this universe _ and , moreover , that waves can propagate only in one direction along the @xmath110 axis .",
    "we wish to determine how these features as well as the spectrum are connected with the violation of causality in the gdel universe .",
    "electromagnetic fields in the gdel universe have been discussed via the debye potential formalism in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the scalar and neutrino perturbations of the gdel universe have been studied by a number of authors  see  @xcite and the references therein .    to see the imprint of acausality on these wave results , it is necessary to compare them with the results of wave propagation in causal gdel - type rotating universes that possess cosmic time . indeed ,",
    "gdel - type solutions of einstein s equations exist that contain both causal and acausal universe models ",
    "see  @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "the metric of such gdel - type solutions is of the form [ g - t1 ] -ds^2=-dt^2 - 2r(t ) dtdy+r^2(t)[dx^2-(^2 - 1 ) ^2 dy^2+dz^2 ] , where @xmath111 is the scale factor , [ g - t2 ] = e^x , = . here",
    "@xmath112 is a constant parameter and @xmath113 is a vorticity parameter .",
    "the gdel solution is recovered for @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 . in general , eq",
    ".   represents a spacetime of petrov type d with three killing vector fields given by @xmath117 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 , so that it is a spatially homogeneous universe of type iii in the bianchi classification .",
    "let @xmath118 be the four - velocity vector of the family of fundamental observers in the gdel - type universe , then this congruence has expansion and rotation , but no shear .",
    "in particular , the _ rotation tensor _ can be expressed as f_=_[;]+a _ [ _ ] , where @xmath119 is the acceleration of this congruence given by @xmath120 with @xmath121 .",
    "it follows that the only nonzero components of @xmath122 are given by @xmath123 , so that the vorticity of the congruence of the fundamental observers can be expressed as = ( 12 f_f^)^1/2=. only positive square roots are considered throughout this paper .",
    "moreover , the expansion is given by @xmath124 .",
    "in the special case of stationary gdel - type universes with @xmath114 , the fundamental observers follow geodesics and the vorticity of their congruence is simply @xmath109 .",
    "various sources have been considered for universes of gdel type  @xcite ; moreover , the corresponding two - fluid cosmological models have been discussed in  @xcite .    for metric  ,",
    "we find @xmath125 and hence the inverse metric is given by [ g - t3 ] -(_s)^2=(^2 - 1)(_t)^2 - 2r^-1 ^ -1(_t)(_y)+r^-2[(_x)^2+^-2(_y)^2+(_z)^2 ] .",
    "the threading coordinate conditions are satisfied here , while the slicing coordinate conditions are only satisfied for @xmath126 .",

    "a detailed treatment of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in this gdel - type universe is due to korotky and obukhov  @xcite and saibatalov  @xcite , who provided a complete description of the spectrum and outlined the main differences between the spectra in the causal and acausal cases .",
    "we emphasize that the more extended treatments of the gdel case in  @xcite and  @xcite go beyond the results of  @xcite , where only the part of the spectrum that was deemed most physically reasonable was presented .",

    "let us recall here that waves can freely propagate parallel to the rotation axis of a compact gravitating source as well as a kerr black hole  @xcite .    what happens to a packet of scalar radiation produced in the neighborhood of @xmath146 in the acausal ( @xmath145 ) gdel - type universe ?",
    "it follows from eq .   that the radiation is then confined in space around @xmath147 .",

    "the primary result , which follows from setting the coefficient of @xmath154 equal to zero , is indeed independent of the nature of the wave and is the hamilton - jacobi equation [ g - t11 ] g^_s_s + m_0 ^ 2=0 , where the scalar field @xmath158 is related to action .",
    "the other equations then describe , for instance , how the wave amplitude @xmath159 propagates along the geodesic that is the solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation , and so on  @xcite .    in the case under consideration , eq",
    ".   implies that [ g - t12 ] ( ^2 - 1)()^2 - 2 ^-1()()+()^2+^-2()^2+()^2+m_0 ^ 2 = 0 . for propagation along the @xmath105 direction , it is natural to assume that [ g - t13 ] s =- et+p_3z , where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are real constants representing the energy and momentum of the particle .",
    "substitution of eq .   into eq .",
    "yields [ g - t14 ] ( ^2 -1 ) e^2 + p_3 ^ 2 + m_0 ^ 2=0 .",
    "this equation has no real solution in the acausal case ( @xmath145 ) , but in the causal case ( @xmath126 ) , the solution corresponds to eq .  , as expected .",
    "that is , the wavefront is the hypersurface of constant phase , which is proportional to @xmath158 in the eikonal approximation ; therefore , hypersurfaces of constant @xmath158 must be spacelike ( for massive fields ) or null ( for massless fields ) in accordance with the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "in general , the solution of the hamilton - jacobi equation corresponds to a geodesic . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath162 and note that @xmath163 ; that is , @xmath164 is a curl - free vector field . taking covariant derivative of eq .  , we find that @xmath165",
    ". this can be written , using the curl - free property , as @xmath166 , which is the geodesic equation for @xmath167 .",
    "thus in the case under consideration , @xmath168 and one can easily find the curl - free geodesic congruence in the causal case ( @xmath126 ) , namely , [ g - t15 ] t = t_0+(1-^2)(-_0 ) , where @xmath169 is the proper time along the world line and [ g - t15 ] x = x_0 , y = y_0+(-_0 ) , z = z_0+(-_0 ) . here",
    "@xmath170 and @xmath171 are constants of integration and @xmath160 and @xmath161 are connected via eq .  .",
    "there is no corresponding geodesic for @xmath145 , as the hamilton - jacobi equation results in an imaginary energy in this case .",
    "it is puzzling that the geodesic corresponding to the eikonal limit of waves propagating in the @xmath105 direction for @xmath126 involves motion in the @xmath110 direction as well .",
    "let us note that in general , metric   allows geodesics moving parallel to the axis of rotation _",
    "regardless of the value of @xmath172 _ ; indeed , [ g - t16 ] ^=(1 , 0 , 0 , ) , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are constants , is the unit four - velocity of such geodesic observers .",
    "however , @xmath175 is _ not _ the gradient of a scalar , since @xmath176 is not a curl - free vector field , as can be directly verified",
    ". a bundle of neighboring geodesics has in general nonzero vorticity ; on the other hand , if the vorticity vanishes at one point , then the bundle will be completely free of vorticity  see page 84 of  @xcite .    the remaining difficulty has to do with the fact that the hamilton - jacobi equation does not result in a _ real _ particle energy for @xmath145 .",
    "_ this circumstance is a consequence of the violation of slicing coordinate conditions in metric  . _ to see this in general , note that the geodesic equation is derived from the extremum of the action , @xmath177 , where [ g - t17 ] s =- m_0 ds is a functional of the path that connects the two _ fixed _ events that are endpoints of the integral in eq .  .",
    "let us define the lagrangian @xmath178 , where @xmath179 . using @xmath180 , the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath181 works out to be @xmath182 , where @xmath183 , as a function of @xmath184 and @xmath185 , must be obtained from @xmath186 .",
    "this equation has the solution [ g - t18 ] -p_0=h(t , x^i , p_j)=p_i ( ) ^1/2 .",
    "_ thus the slicing coordinate conditions would ensure that the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "is real _",
    "then , integrating along _ geodesics _ in eq .  , but now with only the initial event kept fixed and the final event considered variable , we have [ g - t19 ] s(t , x^i)= ^(t , x^i ) ( p_j v^j - h)dt , so that @xmath187 , or @xmath188 , which then leads directly to the hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "however , if eq .   can not produce a real solution , then a real hamiltonian does not exist and the connection of the geodesic equation with the hamilton - jacobi equation and hence wave propagation is severed .",
    "we should mention in passing that this derivation of the hamilton - jacobi equation implies that a fountain of neighboring geodesics emanating from a single event has vanishing vorticity .",
    "it is interesting to illustrate these results for the propagation of dirac particles parallel to the rotation axis of stationary gdel - type universes .",
    "let us now consider the massive dirac equation in a stationary gdel - type universe described by metric   with @xmath114 .",
    "here we follow the standard notation for the newman - penrose formalism as employed in the monograph of chandrasekhar  @xcite .",
    "therefore , due to the nature of the subject matter , the notations and conventions used in this section are generally independent of the rest of the paper , except when otherwise indicated ; in particular , we switch the sign of the metric signature .",
    "an orthonormal frame naturally adapted to the spacetime coordinates is given by @xmath189 which can be used to form a null tetrad frame l=(^t+^z),n=(^t-^z),m=(^x+i^y ) .",
    "the associated non - vanishing spin coefficients are = -=- , = = 2=2=- , while the only nonvanishing weyl scalar is _ 2 = - ( ^2 - 1 ) , as metric   is of petrov type d. following @xcite , the massive dirac equation in the newman - penrose formalism is summarized by the following set of equations @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the components of the dirac spinor , @xmath193 is proportional to the mass of the dirac particle ( see @xcite , p. 543 ) and d = l^_,=n^_,=m^ _ are directional derivatives along the null tetrad frame .",
    "thus , @xmath194 so that the spin coefficients are involved only through a real @xmath195 and the combination -=-= , which is purely imaginary . hence , dirac equation can be finally expressed as @xmath196 let us look for separable solutions of the form [ dirac10 ] [ f_1,f_2,g_1,g_2]=[x_1(x),x_2(x),y_1(x),y_2(x)]e^-it + ik_2y + ik_3 zwith @xmath136 , as for scalar waves examined in the previous section .    the resulting equations for the spinor components @xmath197 and",
    "@xmath198 form a first order system of ordinary differential equations with constant ( complex ) coefficients , namely , [ sys_dirac ] (    c x_1x_2y_1y_2    ) = (    cccc a_+ & b_+ & 0 & b b_- & a_- & b & 00 & -b & a_+ & c_+-b & 0 & c_- & a_-    ) (    c x_1x_2y_1y_2    ) , where @xmath199 and a_= -,b_= i , c_= i .",
    "let us note that the function @xmath200 appears in eq .   and",
    "the subsequent analysis in association with variation along the @xmath110 direction , but such variation disappears once we set @xmath136 in eq .  .",
    "the eigenvalues of the @xmath201 matrix in eq .",
    "determine the solutions .",
    "these are given by _ 1 , ",
    ", 4=-+^1/2 , where @xmath48 and @xmath202 independently can be either @xmath203 or @xmath204 ; that is , @xmath205 .",
    "the elementary solutions of system   are of the form @xmath206 , where @xmath207 .",
    "we require that the dirac equation have finite solutions for all the spinor components for @xmath208 .",
    "the only possibility is then that of having constant solutions for @xmath197 and @xmath198 , i.e. , the determinant of the @xmath201 matrix in eq .",
    "must vanish .",
    "thus the allowed values of @xmath131 satisfy the relation [ spectrum ] ^2(^2 - 1)+()^2-=0 , which agrees with eq .   in the wkb regime .",
    "that is , with @xmath209 and @xmath210 , eq .",
    "can be written as [ spectrum ] ( ^2 - 1)e^2+p_3 ^ 2+m_0 ^ 2(p_3 ^ 2+m_0 ^ 2)^1/2+^2 ^2 ( 1- 4 ^-2)=0 , so that as @xmath155 , while @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath130 are held fixed , we recover the wkb limit .",
    "the two branches of eq .   reflect the spin @xmath211 character of the dirac particle ; indeed , with @xmath212 , the helicity - rotation coupling evident in the spectrum   is precisely reminiscent of the corresponding result for photons  @xcite , when one allows for the different helicities involved .    for a localized packet of cosmic ray protons , for instance",
    ", we expect that the packet is dominated by @xmath213 and @xmath214 , where @xmath215 and @xmath216 are length scales associated with the gdel - type universe .",
    "thus propagation of the packet parallel to the rotation axis is generally possible in the causal case ( @xmath126 ) and impossible in the acausal case ( @xmath127 ) . in the latter situation",
    ", we expect confinement of the _ high - energy _",
    "particles in space , just as for the scalar field ",
    "see eqs .",
    "and  since waves with @xmath217 and @xmath218 may be able to propagate in accordance with eq .  .",
    "the most basic measurements of an observer consist of the determination of temporal and spatial intervals . in this connection",
    ", we have explored the admissibility of coordinate patches in some open spacetime region on the basis of splitting spacetime into its elements via the threading and slicing approaches .",
    "all coordinate systems in general relativity must satisfy the threading ( landau - lifshitz ) conditions .",
    "the lichnerowicz admissibility conditions involve the additional slicing coordinate requirements , which protect chronology and exclude ctcs .",
    "if it were possible to incorporate the slicing coordinate conditions into the geometric structure of lorentzian geometry , violations of chronology and hence ctcs would be forbidden in the general theory of relativity . however , since the  local \" @xmath47 constant hypersurfaces can not be naturally absorbed into the foundations of general relativity , the slicing conditions simply place additional restrictions on possible coordinate systems .",
    "the threading and slicing coordinate requirements together ensure that the coordinates assigned to spacetime events are physically reasonable . as such , coordinate systems that can be physically constructed , such as the gps system , are expected to satisfy lichnerowicz coordinate conditions .",
    "we have examined the physical implications of lichnerowicz conditions by studying wave propagation in spacetimes that do not possess universal temporal coordinates . in such stationary rotating",
    "gdel - type universes , for instance , we show that radiation in the wkb approximation can not propagate parallel to the axis of rotation .",
    "possible generalizations of this result as well as further consequences of chronology violation for wave propagation are topics for future investigation .    helpful discussions with robert jantzen , sergei kopeikin and yuri obukhov are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "imagine an arbitrary @xmath219 matrix of the form a= (          ) , i , j=1,2 , ",
    ", n. we assume that @xmath220 ; in fact , this condition can be ensured  unless @xmath83 is trivial in the sense that it has only zeros in its first row and column  by appropriately shifting rows or columns , as we are only interested in @xmath221 .",
