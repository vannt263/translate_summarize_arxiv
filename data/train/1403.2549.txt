    "historically , research on patterned magnetic materials has first focused on dense arrays of non - interacting and hence independent dots , mainly for magnetic memory purposes . for this reason , the magnetic samples consisted often of arrays of disks and even rings , in the vortex state , or , in general , of systems with some anisotropy but vanishing stray fields @xcite .",
    "however , more recently the interaction among dots in an array is seen more as an opportunity rather than a limit , and the possibility to exploit the collective spin excitation ( `` magnons '' ) as information carriers has been valued , in analogy to light in photonic crystals @xcite .",
    "for this reason , interacting nano - magnets are called `` magnonic crystals '' .",
    "they can be tailored to obtain magnonic band diagrams with the possible occurrence of magnonic bandgaps .",
    "the research includes any other magnetic `` meta - material '' , namely a material with periodic magnetic properties : antidot arrays @xcite and bicomponent continuous films @xcite are other important examples .",
    "these systems are promising candidates for building novel versatile magnetic devices , which can operate either as waveguides or memories , but also as tunable filters , depending on the amplitude of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the possibility of modifying the propagation properties of the information carriers is important for building magnonic- and spin - logic devices @xcite .",
    "besides the experimental investigation ( fabrication and characterization of a magnonic crystal as well as the measurement of its dynamical properties ) , great effort has been devoted to the theoretical understanding of the properties of spin waves in such systems , in particular to set computational tools ( either analytical or micromagnetic ) suitable to simulate and predict their dynamic behavior @xcite",
    ". generally speaking , for a given equilibrium magnetic configuration , there are two main approaches in this context .",
    "first , the simulation of an infinite , periodic 1-d or 2-d system by applying periodic boundary conditions on a unit cell . in the case of the dynamical matrix method @xcite , the landau - lifshitz equation is cast in a matrix form , which depends on the given bloch wave vector .",
    "the diagonalization of this matrix leads to frequencies and space profiles of all possible modes in the spectrum at the given bloch wave vector . in the second approach",
    "a finite , though large , area of the magnetic system , excited by a pulse field with a given symmetry profile , is simulated . after collecting the time evolution of the magnetic response throughout the sample the frequency and wave vector spectrum of the response",
    "is obtained through a temporal and spatial fourier analyses @xcite . here",
    ", the excited mode type depends on the symmetry of the excitation pulse , while the minimum frequency and the frequency resolution depends on the pulse duration and simulation time window . comparing the two techniques",
    ", the latter has been widely preferred by experimentalists , especially for the possibility of controlling the input / output frequency bandwidth through the duration of the time pulse .",
    "the approach we present in this paper belongs to the second category , but is innovative because the excitation field is continuously feeding the system at one single frequency .",
    "consequently , only the modes beating at that frequency are excited .",
    "contrary to a pulse excitation , only a spatial fourier analysis is required to extract the wave vector spectra at the considered frequency . by combining multiple simulations at different excitation frequencies one can determine the dispersion relations at the frequency range of interest at any frequency resolution .",
    "likewise , one can directly visualize the dynamic magnetization existing at a given frequency .",
    "moreover , by studying the dispersion graphs in the time domain , one can directly extract the temporal phase information of the magnonic waves with respect to the microwave excitation .",
    "we will show that this point is crucial in understanding the real symmetry of the excited propagating mode .",
    "finally , the continuous excitation allows spin waves to propagate to a longer extent , overcoming damping problems typical for large arrays @xcite , and providing a larger resolution in wave vector space .    in the next section",
    "we illustrate the method , highlighting the differences with the classically adopted pulse excitation .",
    "we then apply the method on 2d magnonic crystals of different kinds : a square array of interacting magnetic dots , a continuous film with antidot lattice , and a square bicomponent chessboard . in this way",
    "we show both the versatility of the method and validate it with ( published ) experimental data .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold : not only presenting a `` new '' way of finding mode dispersions with a higher resolution , but also a `` proposal '' for experimentalists to continuously feed the system with some excitation .",
    "we will see that , as a consequence , classically hardly observable odd spin wave modes can in principle be detected by brillouin light scattering .",
    "furthermore , the continuous excitation also helps to overcome damping criticality in magnonic crystals . in this respect",
    ", we should remark that only in large magnonic crystals collective spin wave properties can be exploited . here ,",
    "damping of the spin wave intensity is so critical that a signal , usually delivered by a pulse at the input side of the magnonic crystal , can hardly be detected at the output side , compromising the applicability of the technology .",
    "conversely , when reverting to smaller magnonic crystals to overcome the complete signal damping , the collective propagation properties are suppressed by stationary modes of the lattice as a whole .",
    "therefore , in the context of magnonic- and spin - logic devices , a continuous excitation of the spin waves is a promising alternative to address both the collective properties of spin modes and low signal damping .",
    "let us consider a general field @xmath0 which excites spin waves in a magnetic system .",
    "the excited spin waves will depend on the frequency spectrum present in the excitation @xmath1}\\,\\mathrm{d}f . \\end{split}\\label{fft_exc}\\ ] ] indeed , a general excitation contains a distribution of frequencies with corresponding amplitudes @xmath2 ^ 2 + \\left[b^{exc}(f)\\right]^2 } \\label{ampl_exc}\\ ] ] and corresponding phases @xmath3 in terms of phasors rotating in frequency space , @xmath4 is the amplitude of the phasor , while @xmath5 is its initial phase angle .    due to the excitation ,",
    "the magnetization @xmath6 varies in time and space .",
    "we now study the spin waves propagating along the @xmath7-axis by analyzing the @xmath8-component of the magnetization along this axis .",
    "this is done by extracting the spin wave modes defined by a characteristic wave vector @xmath9 and frequency @xmath10 by means of a spatial and a temporal fourier transform of @xmath11 respectively .",
    "@xmath12}\\,\\mathrm{d}f\\mathrm{d}k_x.\\label{fft_mz } \\end{split}\\ ] ] expression ( [ fft_mz ] ) describes the dispersion relation of the different spin wave modes with given ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath14 ^ 2 + \\left[b^{m_z}(k_x , f)\\right]^2},\\label{ampl_mz}\\ ] ] depends on the amplitude of the excitation field at that frequency @xmath15 as well as on the geometrical and material properties of the sample supporting this mode .",
    "hence , since one is only interested in the latter , one should correct expression ( [ ampl_mz ] ) for the excitation field amplitude ( [ ampl_exc ] ) .",
    "the phase has different contributions @xmath16 it indeed depends on the phase of the considered frequency component in the excitation @xmath5 .",
    "moreover it contains an additional phase difference @xmath17 .",
    "the latter can be interpreted as a temporal phase difference between the mode and the excitation a phase @xmath18 then stands for a mode beating in phase with the excitation or as a spatial phase difference between spin wave modes . due to the propagating character of the spin waves , both interpretations are equivalent .      in micromagnetic simulations , a gaussian pulse profile @xmath19 ( @xmath20 real , positive ) is often used to excite the spin modes .",
    "this pulse has a spectrum @xmath21 yielding a constant phase angle @xmath22 . in most cases , the pulse is applied on a restricted area of the sample . after applying the pulse ,",
    "the magnetization dynamics is simulated for some time @xmath23 , sampling the magnetization data at @xmath24 time instants .",
    "this leads to a frequency resolution @xmath25 @xmath26 only @xmath27 frequency components are obtained due to the cyclic nature of fourier transforms . expression ( [ frequencies ] ) shows that , aiming at a large frequency resolution and a large frequency range , one needs to simulate the magnetization response for a long simulation time @xmath23 and store the magnetization multiple times @xmath24 .",
    "based on one single simulation one can build the complete dispersion diagram describing the amplitude of the different excited modes @xmath28 with @xmath29 the discretized wave vector . here , @xmath30 is the sample length in the studied @xmath7-direction , discretized using @xmath31 discretization cells .",
    "equivalently , to obtain a large @xmath32-space resolution over a large @xmath32-range , one needs to simulate a long sample @xmath30 discretized with a large amount of discretization cells .",
    "hence , if one is aiming for a large frequency and @xmath32-space resolution , the magnetization processes in very large samples are to be computed during very long time windows @xmath23 . however , while initially only the magnetization at the excited area is affected by the field pulse , the propagating spin waves distribute the mode energy through the complete sample leading to a decreasing signal amplitude with time , even when a zero gilbert damping is considered .",
    "this puts an upper limit on useful simulation windows @xmath23 and sample dimensions @xmath30 and thus intrinsically limits the frequency and wave vector resolution .",
    "this a fortiori applies for the real experiment , where the propagating signal strength decreases even more because of gilbert damping .",
    "let us now consider a continuous sinusoidal excitation , applied on some restricted area of sample @xmath33 spin waves with the same frequency @xmath34 , but different @xmath9 wave vector , can now propagate from the excited area along the studied propagation direction . to determine these modes one only needs to perform a fourier analysis in @xmath32-space @xmath35}\\ , \\mathrm{d}k_x\\\\ & = \\int |c^{m_z}(k_x , f_0)|\\sin\\{2\\pi f_0 t + \\phi^{m_z}(k_x",

    "\\end{split}\\label{fft_mz_sine}\\ ] ] indeed , the mode varies sinusoidally in time with the same frequency as the excitation and a possible phase delay @xmath36 .",
    "expression ( [ fft_mz_sine ] ) shows that the mode amplitude depends on the time instant @xmath37 at which the magnetization is sampled . in a simulation , the excitation is first applied for a given number of periods @xmath38 to ensure that the excited modes can propagate into the structure and no transient effects are present .",
    "after this , the magnetization is sampled at @xmath24 time instants during half an excitation period @xmath39 by inspecting at what time instant @xmath40 the mode amplitude @xmath41 is maximal , one can extract the mode phase angle with respect to the excitation as @xmath42 and the effective mode amplitude as @xmath43 note that @xmath44 is determined up to an angle @xmath45 .",
    "this explains why only half a period is sampled : the other half results in identical amplitudes @xmath46 and opposite phases @xmath44 .",
    "a visual inspection of the magnetization distribution at @xmath47 easily defines the sign @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , we have chosen the excitation to follow a sine and not a cosine function to limit transient effects when starting the simulations . indeed , starting from @xmath49 the excitation increases gradually from zero towards its maximum value .    to build the complete dispersion diagram",
    ", one needs to perform multiple simulations with excitation frequencies distributed over a predefined range .",
    "this distribution does not need to be uniform : certain frequency ranges can be simulated with an increased frequency resolution , e.g. to study a specific spin wave mode or a band gap in large detail , while other frequency ranges can be sampled with a lower frequency resolution by considering fewer simulations , which makes the method extremely versatile .",
    "contrary to applying a pulse excitation , it is not necessary to consider a vanishing damping in order to ensure a spin wave propagation far into the sample .",
    "the external sinusoidal field feeds the system continuously leading to a large amplitude wave propagation over extended areas of the magnonic crystal .",
    "consequently , in regime , the gilbert damping balances the energy that is continuously introduced into the system by the excitation as one would find in the real experiment . moreover , the total power is not dissipated among all the modes over a wide range of frequencies as with a pulse excitation , but concentrated at the frequency of a single mode ( or just a few , if more k - modes occur at that frequency ) .",
    "hence the continuous excitation approach opens opportunities with respect to the effective implementation of spin wave based technology where large distances should be covered .",
    "some other straightforward advantages of the method : ( i ) by considering a fixed excitation amplitude @xmath50 in all simulations for different frequencies @xmath51 , see expression ( [ hexc_sine ] ) , all modes are excited with the same power , making ",
    "contrary to an pulse excitation  a direct comparison between all mode amplitudes possible ; ( ii ) the magnetization profile and its time variation at a given frequency is directly obtained from the simulations enabling an immediate visual interpretation of the possible modes existing at that frequency ; ( iii ) for the complete dispersion spectrum , the phase difference @xmath52 with the excitation can be obtained in a straightforward manner .    in this approach , many small simulations instead of one single large simulation ( pulse excitation ) have to be performed .",
    "this is in line with current computer hardware evolutions towards powerful computer clusters .",
    "all simulations for different frequencies @xmath51 are completely independent from each other and can thus be performed in parallel . for this contribution",
    "we use our gpu cluster containing 16 nodes .",
    "each node in the cluster runs the micromagnetic software package mumax , speeding up each single simulation with two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "we apply the sinusoidal excitation approach to the 2d magnonic crystal presented by tacchi _",
    "it comprises a 30 nm thick matrix consisting of 450nm@xmath53450 nm square permalloy dots separated 70 nm from each other , hence with lattice constant u=520 nm .",
    "we use identical magnetic parameters : saturation magnetization @xmath54=820ka / m , exchange constant @xmath55=1.0@xmath56j / m and zero anisotropy . an external bias field of 119.4ka / m is applied parallel to one of the dot edges .",
    "the propagation properties of the waves traveling perpendicular to and parallel with this bias field are studied .",
    "first , we recall that in the linear approximation of magnetization dynamics , the time evolution of the magnetization can be seen as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the equilibrium 2d map of the magnetization , and @xmath59 is the dynamic magnetization which we will study in the following .    in order to understand the collective spin wave dynamics in arrays of dots at any",
    "given time , dynamic modes are expressed as 2d bloch waves @xmath60 with @xmath61 the radius - vector in direct space , @xmath62 the bloch wave vector , and @xmath63 the cell function , which contains the periodicity of the array . at @xmath62=(0,0 ) the mode is represented at any @xmath61 by its cell function .",
    "this cell function can be described as for single dots , by means of the orientation of the nodal lines ( surfaces ) with respect to the ( local ) direction of the magnetization .",
    "consequently , damon - eshbach - like ( n - de ) modes are characterized by @xmath64 nodal lines parallel to the local magnetization while backward - like ( m - ba ) modes are characterized by @xmath65 nodal lines perpendicular to the local magnetization .",
    "the fundamental mode can be seen either as 0-ba or 0-de and mixed modes possess nodal lines of both types . furthermore , confinement effects give rise to end - modes , with dynamic magnetization intensity localized only at the edges of the dot in the direction of the applied field .",
    "these modes usually appear at the lowest frequencies @xcite . due to the bloch factor , the apparent profile @xmath66 of all these modes changes when @xmath67 at different @xmath61 in the array . in our simulation approach",
    ", one can directly visualize the 2d profile @xmath68 of each mode at any frequency and label it . by means of a spatial fourier analysis of the magnetization patterns in a given frequency range",
    ", the full spectrum of spin waves can be determined .",
    "their behavior propagating or stationary can be deduced by inspecting the slope of the dispersion curves .    5 dots .",
    "the outer dots ( dark gray ) have a higher damping constant to inhibit unwanted reflections .",
    "the excitation is applied on a central dot depicted with a chessboard pattern .",
    "the spin wave data is obtained along horizontal lines in the central array of dots , e.g. line a for edge modes and line b for bulk modes .",
    "[ fig_geometry ] ]          we simulate the dot array by considering an elongated rectangular matrix of 32@xmath535 dots , see fig .",
    "[ fig_geometry ] , discretized using 4096@xmath53512 finite difference cells .",
    "only spin waves propagating along the @xmath7-axis are studied .",
    "hence , the spectra for perpendicular and parallel bias field are obtained from distinct simulations with the bias field applied along the @xmath69-axis and the @xmath7-axis , respectively .",
    "the long simulation size @xmath70 m ensures a high @xmath32-space resolution , see ( [ wave_vectors ] ) .",
    "magnetization data @xmath11 can be collected along horizontal lines in the central row of the array , e.g. line a for edge modes and line b for bulk modes .",
    "we treat five rows of dots as a good approximation of the full 2d character of the magnonic crystal .",
    "the dots at the boundary of the crystal  in fig .",
    "[ fig_geometry ] depicted in dark gray  have a high damping constant . in this way , spin waves",
    "are not reflected , but absorbed without interfering with the spin waves in the central row of dots .",
    "this rules out stationary modes due to confinement effects .",
    "elsewhere , the damping constant is put at @xmath71 . as in @xcite , a spatially uniform excitation profile applied on a central dot , in fig .",
    "[ fig_geometry ] depicted with the chessboard pattern is used .",
    "however , the excitation field is not a pulse , but has a continuous sinusoidal wave form [ eq .",
    "( [ hexc_sine ] ) ] .",
    "the amplitude @xmath50 is two orders of magnitude smaller than the bias field .",
    "this is larger than in the experiment , but is required to have a spin wave signal which is above the noise level throughout large portions of the sample . for our gpu computations",
    "this relative noise level is @xmath72 since we have a floating point accuracy .",
    "the amplitude is however small enough in order not to awake non - linear magnetization dynamics .",
    "for each direction of the bias field we have run simulations with excitation frequencies @xmath51 ranging from 5ghz to 20ghz with steps @xmath73=50mhz .      to explain the phase extraction method",
    ", we consider now bulk spin waves propagating perpendicular to the bias field with 15.5ghz@xmath7417.5ghz .",
    "a discussion of the complete dispersion diagram is postponed to the next section .",
    "once the system is relaxed to its ground state with the bias field directed along the @xmath69-axis , the sinusoidal excitation is applied for 20 periods to enable the spin waves to propagate in the system and reach equilibrium conditions between excitation and damping . during the 21@xmath75 excitation period , @xmath76 along line b in fig .",

    "[ fig_phases ] , is obtained by means of a spatial fourier transform on the complete data set @xmath81 . in the third column of fig .",
    "[ fig_phases ] we plot only ( @xmath9,@xmath51 ) points where the intensity in the power spectrum is maximal at time points @xmath79 . from that",
    ", the phase difference with the excitation @xmath36 can be found using ( [ phase_angle ] ) , resulting in phase sensitive dispersion diagrams . combining all maximum values in one graph , i.e. collecting all mode amplitude data irrespective the phase",
    ", one can visualize the mode amplitude @xmath82 as in fig .",
    "[ fig_amplitude ]",
    ".     constructed by summing up all phase sensitive phase diagrams .",
    "the full circles are the experimental bls data from @xcite.[fig_amplitude ] ]    from a closer inspection of the graphs in fig .",
    "[ fig_phases]-left column , and fig .",
    "[ fig_amplitude ] , we see that depending on the time phase with respect to the excitation a 2-de - like profile is established in the excited , central cell over a 2ghz frequency range .",
    "indeed , at different time points , the modes in this frequency range give rise to the same 2-de - like profile .",
    "this is illustrated by the maximum power lines which , remarkably , shift from one frequency to another as time flows indicating that the phase difference @xmath52 varies continuously with frequency , see the phase dependent dispersions in fig .",
    "[ fig_phases]-right column .",
    "figure [ fig_primitive]-left shows dynamic magnetization maps of the central , excited cell at different time points . for @xmath10=15.45ghz [ @xmath10=16.55ghz ] this dot has a maximal [ zero ] magnetization amplitude when the excitation is maximal and a zero [ maximal ] magnetization amplitude when the excitation is zero , meaning that the magnetization profile is beating in phase [ with a 90 degree phase difference ] with respect to the excitation .    however , the dynamic magnetization map in the central dot is ambiguous , since it only visualizes how the spin waves are excited by the sinusoidal excitation field , but not how they propagate through the magnonic crystal .",
    "in fact , since the considered excitation has a uniform profile covering the entire central cell , the magnetization map in this specific cell should possess an even symmetry . indeed , it can be either uniform or have an even number of nodes in both the @xmath7- and @xmath69-direction ( as even - node harmonics of higher order ) .",
    "this should be true at all time points .",
    "consequently , the spin waves need to be stationary : their nodal lines can not move .",
    "we can understand this by considering that , in the excited cell , the stationary wave results from a superposition of two propagating waves @xmath83 and @xmath84 with exactly the same cell function , but traveling in opposite directions out of the central cell : @xmath85 and + @xmath86 .",
    "the superposition can lead to either functions @xmath87 or @xmath88 . to have an even profile",
    ", the function @xmath89 needs to be a superposition of even functions @xmath90 , with a resulting power that is maximum at t=0 , and zero at t = t/4 , i.e. has a 90 degree phase difference with respect to the excitation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_primitive]-left , mode at 16.55 ghz ) . for the same reason",
    ", @xmath91 needs to be a superposition of odd functions with a resulting amplitude that is exactly zero at t=0 , and maximum at t = t/4 , i.e. it beats in phase with respect to the excitation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_primitive]-left , mode at 15.45 ghz ) .        hence , looking at the excited cell only",
    ", it is impossible to study the propagating character of the single @xmath92 functions : one needs to consider a unit cell that is not involved in the excitation process .",
    "to that purpose , fig .",
    "[ fig_primitive]-right shows the time evolution of the dynamic magnetization in the first cell on the right of the excited one , the @xmath84 wave . here , the propagating character is observed by following the shift of extrema and nodal lines from the left to the right .",
    "for example , referring to the mode at 16.55ghz , it is clear that the maximum on the left at t=0 ( the red area ) gradually shifts to the right part of the dot as time increases .",
    "similar considerations hold for all other modes at different frequencies .    moreover , in fig .",
    "[ fig_primitive]-left , we can see that both modes , at 15.45ghz and 16.55ghz , show an even profile in the excited cell .",
    "however , by inspection of the profiles on the right panel , we understand that the propagating mode @xmath84 at 16.55ghz is actually a 2-de mode ( even ) and that one at 15.45ghz is actually a 1-de mode ( odd ) . following the explanations above , the superposition of left and right propagating waves results , in the excited cell ( left panel ) , to a maximal signal at t=0 for the even mode at 16.55ghz and a maximal signal at t = t/4 for the odd mode at 15.45ghz .",
    "the fact that a continuous , spatially uniform excitation can activate modes independent of their symmetry by just tuning the excitation frequency is a remarkable feature of the presented method .",
    "going through the broad band shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_amplitude ] , at each frequency f a different combination of propagating modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 superimposes to the same magnetization profile in the excited cell : the 2-de profile .",
    "in fact , the magnetization profile can result simply from a single mode ( odd or even ) , or , more often , can result from the superposition of several modes as in the case of non - monotonic dispersion curves @xmath95 .",
    "the time point at which the superposition gives rise to the maximum signal defines the phase difference with the excitation .",
    "this phase difference turns a magnetization profile with any definite symmetry into an even profile in the central excited cell as required by the excitation process .",
    "we have explained why and how the mode power depends on time , and how this dependence is different if we focus on the central dot ( the excited one , where spin waves have a stationary behavior ) or in the rest of the array ( where the propagating character of waves becomes apparent ) .",
    "in particular , when performing the spatial fourier analysis , we can take or not into consideration the central ( excited ) cell , and understand its influence on the dispersion graphs .",
    "in an ideal infinite array , in which edge effects are negligible and no direct excitation is considered , only thermal spin waves exist . even though their profile varies in time and from cell to cell , these variations are undetectable when averaged over the crystal , leading to a calculated / measured power independent of time . on the contrary ,",
    "when in this infinite array the waves are excited from a given lattice site , the mode power averaged over the array is weighted by the intensity of the wave at different lattice sites .",
    "consequently , now the mode power definitely depends on time as the gilbert damping makes an infinite array effectively finite .",
    "indeed , modes with @xmath96 have different dynamic profiles in adjacent cells of the crystal , see eq .",
    "( [ bloch ] ) .",
    "as time flows , the wave propagates and damps out , shifting the different magnetization profiles from one cell to another and decreasing their contribution to the corresponding calculated / measured average power .",
    "this actually happens in our simulations , which deal both with a finite size array and with a localized excitation field , especially when we exclude the central , excited cell from the fourier analysis . in fig .",
    "[ fig_tac ] [ fig .",
    "[ fig_tac_par ] ] we plot the dispersion relations of the spin waves propagating perpendicular [ parallel ] to the applied field at time points t=0 and t = t/4 , calculated including ( panel a , c ) or excluding ( panel b , d ) the excited cell in the center of the array . while the dispersion graphs that exclude the central cell show a small time dependence , only due to the propagation and damping of modes described above , when the central cell is included in the fourier analysis the time dependence is more critical . due to the excitation process and superposition effects , modes in the central cell",
    "have a power which strongly varies with time : namely , modes with even [ odd ] profile are particularly amplified at t=0 [ t = t/4 ] . recalling that the bls cross section is , at a first approximation , proportional to the average mode power @xcite , this leads to the proposal to measure the presence of odd modes .",
    "usually , in a bls experiment , odd modes have a very small cross section , making them hardly measurable , unless considering large incidence angles @xcite .",
    "however , in an excitation / detection experiment involving the bls experiment , the laser beam ( which , in microfocused - bls - technique @xcite , has a space fwhm of about 300 nm ) can be focused to illuminate an area containing or not the excited region , and the spectra collected in the two cases can be compared .",
    "the peaks corresponding to odd modes will be present only in the spectrum containing the excited cell while those corresponding to even modes will be present in both spectra . in this way",
    ", the spin wave dynamics of magnonic systems can be interpreted with much more confidence .    when comparing our results with the experiments , we recall that the usual resolution of bls measurements is around 0.5ghz .",
    "this suits with the experimental points found for k=0 at about 10.6ghz and 11.0ghz in the first panels of both figs .",
    "[ fig_tac ] and [ fig_tac_par ] , which should indeed correspond to the same mode . to this extent ,",
    "the simulations show a good agreement with bls measurements , especially for t=0 , where even ( bls active ) modes are amplified .    referring to figs .",
    "[ fig_tac ] and [ fig_tac_par ] , we discuss now only the few modes that are helpful to interpret the experimental bls points .",
    "the mode at about 11ghz ( at k=0 ) is rather non - dispersive along the direction perpendicular to the bias field ( fig .",
    "[ fig_tac]-panel a , group velocity nearly zero ) , and has a slightly negative dispersion along the direction parallel to the bias field ( fig .",
    "[ fig_tac_par]-panel a ) ; from inspection of the magnetization profile , we find that its cell function is rather uniform parallel with the bias field , but with 4 nodes along perpendicular direction . this mode is usually addressed to as a 4-ba - like mode , and propagates parallel to the direction of the applied field . since this is a mode with an even cell function , it is best seen in panel ( a ) of both figs .",
    "[ fig_tac ] , [ fig_tac_par ] .",
    "we skip modes in the range 11@xmath97ghz , which show a clear backward - like character , but are outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we focus now our attention on the mode that experimentally occurs at about 12.3ghz ( k=0 , mean value between the two bls points at @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) , and which we find numerically at about 12.1ghz .",

    "we have presented a method to compute the dispersion diagrams of spin waves and get information on spin wave space profiles . unlike existing methods",

    "consequently , only spin waves with the same frequency are excited .",
    "a spatial fourier analysis of the magnetization data makes it possible to study the dispersion relations @xmath95 in the time domain : the dispersion graphs are time dependent , as they are determined by the phase difference of the mode with respect to the excitation .",
    "dispersion relations in any arbitrary frequency range are obtained by combining independent simulations at different frequencies allowing any frequency resolution and making the approach perfectly suitable for a computational cluster environment , where many parallel simulations can be performed at once .    since the excitation is continuous and spatially uniform , the activated spin waves are in the excited area stationary with an even profile .",
    "we show that these profiles can result from the superposition of propagating modes with either even or odd cell functions .",
    "consequently , the superposition of odd modes , usually have a vanishing average power anywhere in the crystal , give rise to an even profile with large average power in the excited area . in this respect , we indicate that it can be experimentally feasible to both excite and detect the odd modes , and distinguish them from the even modes by comparison of bls spectra measured in two different regions of the crystal , one containing the excitation area , the other not .",
    "odd spin wave profiles result in bls peaks only visible in the region containing the excited area , while even spin wave profiles are visible in both regions .",
    "furthermore , due to the persistence of the excitation at one single frequency , the spin waves can propagate over very long distances through the crystal without severe attenuation .",
    "this results in dispersions with both a large resolution in k - space , and a large intensity up to high order brillouin zones .",
    "the latter is particularly interesting . when dealing with almost continuous media ( as antidot arrays or bicomponent materials ) , modes with quasi - continuous dispersions are possible . for these modes",
    "it is necessary to look at large wave vectors if the higher frequency response of the mode is aimed at .",
    "moreover , the relatively low attenuation of the spin wave signal opens perspectives to technological applications in which larger systems with input and output antennas at opposite ends can be used as magnonic guides .",
