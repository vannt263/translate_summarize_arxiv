    "we follow the _ normal play _ convention , meaning that a player who can not move loses and the other player wins .    in general an impartial game",
    "consists of a _ position _ , which contains information of whose turn it is and describes the given state of the game , and a _ ruleset _ , which decides what move options there are for a given position .",
    "sometimes the term `` game '' is adapted to mean only the ruleset , other times the term `` position '' encompasses the usual meaning of a game , that is whenever the ruleset is understood . here",
    "we study so - called _ invariant _ games @xcite , where the rules in general do not depend on the given position .",
    "for example , in _ 2-heap nim _",
    "@xcite the players remove tokens from precisely one of two finite heaps , at least one token and at most a whole heap .",
    "the game is invariant in the sense that , independent of the size of a heap , a given number of tokens can be removed provided the heap contains at least this number of tokens . as for all impartial games , this game has a _ perfect winning strategy _ , here : the second player to move wins if and only if the two heaps have the same non - negative number of tokens .    in general , for an impartial game @xmath12 without drawn moves ,",

    "our final three extensions of @xmath163-rn are as follows : adjoin moves of the form + game ( a ) : @xmath195 , + game ( b ) : @xmath196 , + game ( c ) : @xmath197 , + for positive integers @xmath74 , bearing in mind that the positions satisfy ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "the first two extensions have complicated patterns of @xmath13-positions which we do not yet understand , of which at least the first appears to exhibit a similar splitting ` behavior ' as does @xmath163-rw , but game ( c ) has the same set of @xmath13-positions as does @xmath163-rn , which can be proved by elementary methods , see also @xcite for related results .",
    "hence the answer to the first question in this final section is negative ; see also @xcite for a discussion of this question in the context of heap games , computational complexity and algorithmic undecidability .",
    "the purpose of this paper has been to introduce the subject of @xmath50-subtraction games and resolve the most basic question , that is of @xmath49-equivalence of @xmath65-subtraction games .",
    "as we indicate in figures [ f:4 ] and [ f:5 ] , the most interesting `` new '' games are the generic @xmath50-subtraction games .",
    "( for example , could a study of extensions of @xmath198 lead to new revelations of the behavior of @xmath191gdwn ? ) of course one would like to extend the notion of @xmath49-equivalence to games on several heaps , which can be done essentially by applying the same ideas as in section [ s:1 ] and [ s:2 ] .",
