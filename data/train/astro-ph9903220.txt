    "the slope and the zeropoint of the pl relation is taken from the very well - observed cepheids in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , whose distance modulus is adopted to be @xmath10 ( madore & freedman 1991 ) .    an old pl relation calibrated by galactic cepheids in open cluster , and",

    "reviews of cepheid distances ( federspiel , tammann , & sandage 1998 ; gratton 1998 ) cluster around @xmath12 ,  a value in perfect agreement with the purely geometrical distance determination of sn1987a ( @xmath13 ; gilmozzi & panagia 1999 ) . in his excellent review gratton ( 1998 ) concludes from the rich literature on rrlyr stars that @xmath14 .",
    "he also discusses five distance determination methods which give lower moduli by @xmath15mag , but they are still at a more experimental stage .",

    "the question is here of more principal than practical importance because the _ mean _ metallicity of the seven spiral galaxies and one am galaxy considered below hardly differs by much from the galactic metallicity .",
    "evidence for a ( very ) weak metallicity dependence comes from the fact that the metal - rich galactic cepheids give perfectly reasonable distances for the moderately metal - poor lmc cepheids and the really metal - poor smc cepheids and , still more importantly , that their relative distances are wavelength - independent ( di benedetto 1997 ; cf .",

    "( 1998 ) and freedman ( 1999 ) that the two _ twin _ sneia 1989b and 1980n should differ by @xmath52 in luminosity has little credibility .",

    "the original driver was the hope to unify the bright , blue sneia with `` branch - normal '' spectra and the faint , red sneia with peculiar spectra .",
    "the latter are easily distinguished by the observer and are here excluded a priori , because blue and red sneia may well form a dichotomy ( e.g. nadyozhin 1998 ) .",
    "but even for the blue sneia with a total luminosity range of @xmath53 it is justified to ask whether their luminosity depends on second parameters .",
    "indeed it could be established that the luminosity of blue sneia correlates with the decline rate @xmath27 ( or some other measure of the light curve shape ) , the sn color , and the hubble type ( or color ) of the parent galaxy .",
    "there must be other more physical parameters like ni mass , temperature , expansion velocity , or spectral features which correlate with luminosity , but the data are presently too sparse to be useful .",
    "an increase of the luminosity scatter with increasing galactocentric distance , proposed by wang , hflich , & wheeler ( 1997 ) , does not seem to be significant for blue sneia ( parodi et  al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the difficulty of establishing a sn luminosity - second - parameter correlation is that independently determined luminosities are needed .",
    "all known distance indicators with the necessary range , except cepheids observed with _ hst _ , are much too inaccurate for the purpose . since",

    "it is safe therefore to concentrate on blue sneia beyond @xmath55 .",
    "the best visualization of how to derive second - parameter correlations is provided by the hubble diagram of blue sneia ( fig .  1 ) .",

    "the best correlation between the luminosity and the decline rate @xmath27 is given by the same sneia as ( assuming arbitrarily @xmath58 ) @xmath59 where the scatter is only marginally reduced .",
    "the luminosity - sncolor relation , again for the same sneia , is given by @xmath60 the corresponding equation for @xmath9 follows trivially by decreasing the slope by one unit . sn  color is apparently somewhat more efficient in reducing the scatter than the decline rate @xmath61 .    in principle",
    "the variation in color can be intrinsic to the present sample of sneia or can be caused by absorption in the host galaxy .",
    "riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) , riess et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and phillips et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) have argued that absorption is the main cause .",
    "however , in that case the slope in equation  ( 7 ) would have to be close to 4 . a definite proof that _ most _ of the color variation is in fact _ intrinsic",
    "_ , which is also expected from all sn models , has been provided by saha et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) who have shown that sneia become _",
    "brighter _ in @xmath62 as @xmath63 becomes _ redder _ , and again _ brighter _ in @xmath19 and @xmath62 as @xmath64 becomes _ redder _ !    the fact that internal absorption plays a relatively minor role in distant sneia , whereas four of the calibrating sneia suffer an appreciable absorption is not as puzzling as it may appear at first sight , because observational selection effects dominate the available samples .",
    "the apparent magnitudes of the nearby calibrators are so bright that some absorption hardly hampers their discovery . at large distances , however , only the _ apparently _ very brightest sneia are discovered , which automatically discriminates against absorption .",
    "present data do not allow to derive a clear - cut correlation between luminosity and hubble type t. while the nearer sneia in ellipticals are @xmath65 fainter in e / s0 galaxies than in spirals ( note that any absorption correction could only increase the difference ) , the difference disappears beyond @xmath55 . clearly larger samples are needed . in any case the hubble type t",
    "is strongly correlated with @xmath27 , and once the sn luminosities are corrected for @xmath27 and color no significant correlation with t remains .",
    "if the 17 most distant sneia of the sample are reduced to @xmath66 and @xmath67 by means of equations  ( 5)(7 ) one obtains a corrected hubble line of form @xmath68 here the small scatter is close to what can be expected from the observational errors in @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath61 .",
    "any additional reduction of the scatter would therefore be artificial .",
    "( the two - step procedure to correct first for @xmath61 and then for color is statistically not correct .",
    "however , @xmath27 and color are so weakly correlated that a simultaneous solution gives exactly the same result [ cf .",
    "parodi et  al .",
    "the most interesting conclusion for the physicist is that the empirical luminosity calibration of sneia is in very good agreement with the results of present model calculations .",
    "the cosmologist must be pleased that uncorrected blue sneia have a luminosity scatter of only @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( and even less in @xmath62 ) .",
    "after correction for @xmath61 ( or any similar light curve shape parameter ) and color the scatter is reduced to @xmath73 , which might entirely be caused by observational errors .",
    "it is not likely that the universe will ever offer better standard candles .",
    "correspondingly the sneia corrected for @xmath27 and color give from equation  ( 8) @xmath76 the @xmath18 and @xmath19 magnitudes lead to the same relation by construction because they are reduced to @xmath77 .",
    " if the analogue corrections ( from equations  ( 5)(7 ) ) are applied to the seven calibrators in table  1 with known @xmath27 , one obtains @xmath78 and from a combination of equations  ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) @xmath79    the value of @xmath1 after correction for @xmath27 and color is 9% larger than without these corrections .",
    "the reason is that the local calibrators are somewhat slower decliners ( @xmath80 ) and somewhat bluer ( @xmath81 ) than the distant sneia .",
