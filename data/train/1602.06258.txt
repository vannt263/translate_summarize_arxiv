    "we consider the problem faced by a _ searcher _ of locating a stationary target or _",
    "hider _ located at the vertex of a connected edge - weighted graph @xmath0 .",
    "we interpret the weight of an edge as the time taken to search that edge .",
    "the search must start at a given vertex @xmath1 called the _ root _ and consists of a sequence of edges chosen in such a way that every edge must be adjacent to some previous edge , so that the set of edges that have been searched at any point forms a connected subgraph of @xmath0 . for a given search and a given vertex @xmath2 at which the hider is located",
    ", the _ search time _ of @xmath2 is the first time an edge in the search is incident to @xmath2 .",
    "this paradigm of search , recently introduced in alpern and lidbetter  @xcite is known as _ expanding search _",
    ", in contrast to the more usual search paradigm , referred to here as _ pathwise search _ in which a search corresponds to a walk in a graph .",
    "the expanding search paradigm is an appropriate model for situations in which the cost of `` re - exploration '' is negligible compared to the cost of searching , for example when mining coal : here digging into a new site is far more costly than moving the drill through an area that has already been dug .",
    "another interpretation , described in detail in alpern and lidbetter  @xcite , is that of a team of searchers splitting up in the search for a target , for example a bomb or terrorist unit .",
    "we illustrate the concept of expanding search on a graph with an example .",
    "consider the graph @xmath3 depicted in figure [ fig : example ] with root @xmath1 ; vertices @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; and edges @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 of lengths @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "an example of an expanding search on @xmath3 , which we will denote by @xmath15 , is the sequence of edges , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath11 , @xmath10 . under @xmath15 ,",
    "the search time of vertex @xmath7 is @xmath16 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    alpern and lidbetter  @xcite take the approach of seeking randomized search strategies that minimize the expected search time in the worst case : that is , the maximum expected search time over all vertices .",
    "they also consider the problem of determining the search that minimizes some weighted average of the search times of the vertices . in this paper , we take an alternative approach by considering a normalized version of the search time obtained by dividing the search time of a vertex @xmath2 by the length of the shortest path from @xmath1 to @xmath2 . for example , in the graph @xmath3 depicted in figure [ fig : example ] , the normalized search time under @xmath15 of vertex @xmath7 is @xmath17 since @xmath7 is at a distance of @xmath18 from the root .",
    "the maximum the normalized search time takes over all vertices of the graph is called the _ search ratio_. in @xmath3 , the normalized search time of @xmath15 is maximized at @xmath5 , where it is equal to @xmath19 , so this is the search ratio of @xmath15 . this paper studies the problem of finding an expanding search with minimum search ratio .",
    "our choice of the search ratio as the objective for expanding search is motivated by earlier work by koutsoupias et al .",
    "@xcite , who introduced this objective in the context of pathwise search .",
    "their approach is analogous to the competitive analysis of online algorithms , in which the performance of an online algorithm is measured against the performance of an optimal offline algorithm ; more precisely , the optimal offline algorithm corresponds to simply taking the shortest path to the target . as in koutsoupias et al .",
    "@xcite , we consider not only deterministic searches , but also randomized searches , with the aim of finding the randomized expanding search that minimizes the expected value of the normalized search time in the worst case .",
    "equivalently , we view this problem as a zero - sum game between a hider who chooses a vertex of the graph and a searcher who chooses an expanding search .",
    "the payoff , which the hider seeks to maximize and the searcher to minimize , is the normalized search time .",
    "this puts our work in the broader category of _ search games _ , a more general framework for games played between a hider who chooses a point in some search space and a searcher who makes some choice of how to navigate through the space with the aim of minimizing a given cost function .",
    "it is worth mentioning that normalized cost formulations very similar to the search ratio have also been previously studied in the context of searching in unbounded domains ( see , e.g. , the work of gal  @xcite ) . in such domains ,",
    "the hider can ensure the search time is arbitrarily large by choosing positions arbitrarily far from the root .",
    "this observation motivates the need for normalizing the search cost , which is accomplished by dividing this cost by the shortest - path cost from the root to the hider .",
    "in the spirit of the work of koutsoupias et al .",
    "@xcite , in this paper we focus on computational and algorithmic issues of expanding search .",
    "we note that alpern and lidbetter  @xcite follow a purely mathematical approach to analyzing expanding search , with an emphasis on evaluating the value of the corresponding zero - sum games ; computational and algorithmic issues are not considered .",
    "table  [ table : summary ] illustrates the context of our work with respect to previous work .",
    "we note that the problem of minimizing the average search time of the vertices of a graph assuming the pathwise search formulation is precisely the well - known problem of minimizing the _ latency _ of a graph , also known as the _ traveling repairman _",
    "problem ( see  @xcite for some representative results on this problem ) .",
    "the problem of choosing the randomized ( pathwise ) search that minimizes the _ maximum expected search time _ of points of a network was formalized by gal  @xcite , and has been extensively studied , as discussed in subsection  [ sec : related ] .",
    ".previous work and relations between search paradigms and objectives . [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab : game2 ]    by assumption , against strategy @xmath20 , the best response of the hider ( that is , the highest payoff ) is given by choosing vertex @xmath21 .",
    "we show that against strategy @xmath22 , the hider s best response is to choose a vertex @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "this follows from writing the difference , @xmath25 between the payoffs in entries @xmath26 and @xmath27 of table [ tab : game2 ] as @xmath28 the quadratic in @xmath29 inside the parentheses is increasing for positive values of @xmath30 , and when @xmath31 the quadratic is positive . since @xmath32",
    ", we must have @xmath33 .",
    "hence the hider does not have a dominating strategy in the game in table [ tab : game2 ] .",
    "it is also clear that the searcher does not have a dominating strategy , since it is better to search @xmath34 last if and only if the hider is at some @xmath35 with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the game in table [ tab : game2 ] has a unique equilibrium in proper mixed strategies ( that is , the players both play each of their strategies with positive probability ) .",
    "the search ratio @xmath36 of @xmath37 is bounded above by the value @xmath38 of the game , which is easily verified to be @xmath39 this is clearly at most @xmath40 , with equality if and only if @xmath41 . the theorem follows by induction , and equality is only possible if @xmath42 .",
    "we give a particular class of star graphs for which @xmath43 is optimal .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a star graph and @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath43 is optimal and the search ratio @xmath46 is @xmath47    we prove by induction on the number of edges that @xmath48 , from which the theorem follows , by ( [ eq : star - lb ] ) . for @xmath49 or @xmath50 ,",
    "there is no @xmath51 satisfying @xmath45 , so condition ( [ eq : edge - bound ] ) does not apply .",
    "for the case @xmath49 , it is clearly true that @xmath52 , since @xmath53 is the only search strategy available . for @xmath50 , the strategy @xmath54 is an optimal mixture of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , that is a mixture of the only @xmath13 pure strategies available to the searcher . by lemma [ lemma:2-star ]",
    ", this mixture is optimal and @xmath57 .",
    "so we suppose that @xmath58 for some @xmath45 and we show that @xmath59 .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : edge - bound ] ) that against @xmath20 , the best response of the hider is to choose edge @xmath34 .",
    "we show that the best response of the hider against @xmath22 is to choose some edge @xmath60 with @xmath24 .",
    "similarly to the proof of the theorem [ thm : star - bound ] , we calculate the difference @xmath25 between the payoffs in entries @xmath26 and @xmath27 of table [ tab : game1 ] .",
    "@xmath61 now the coefficient of @xmath62 in the quadratic in parentheses above is clearly positive , and so is the coefficient of @xmath63 , since @xmath64 .",
    "hence for positive @xmath63 , the quadratic is increasing in @xmath63 .",
    "it follows from the inequality @xmath65 that @xmath66 , so it is sufficient to show that @xmath25 is non - negative for @xmath67 . substituting this value of @xmath63 into our expression for @xmath25",
    ", we obtain : @xmath68 hence the game in table [ tab : game1 ] has an equilibrium in proper mixed strategies , and it is a simple calculation to show that the value @xmath36 of the game is @xmath69 this completes the proof .",
    "we note that all our results on expanding search on star graphs can easily be extended to pathwise search , with very similar proofs .",
    "we have undertaken an analysis of expanding search , as defined by alpern and lidbetter  @xcite , focusing on the search ratio , as introduced by koutsoupias et al .",
    "@xcite in the context of pathwise search in bounded domains .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , we have focused on computational and algorithmic issues of expanding search , an angle that is often neglected in the analysis of search games . for general graphs",
    ", we showed that computing the search ratio is np - complete , and we gave a @xmath70 approximation .",
    "our main technical contribution is defining and analyzing explicit randomized search strategies that yield significant improvements to the approximation of the randomized search ratio of trees and unweighted graphs ( namely , an approximation equal to 5/4 ) .",
    "we believe that some of the techniques we introduced in this work can be applicable in the context of pathwise search .",
    "for instance , we believe that a variants of the randomized strategy presented in section  [ sec : trees ] will result in improved randomized search ratios for pathwise search in weighted trees .    we leave some open questions which we would like to see addressed by future work .",
    "although we have showed that computing the search ratio of a graph is np - hard , we do not have an equivalent result for computing the randomized search ratio ( though we suspect such a result holds ) .",
    "it would be very interesting to improve upon the approximations of the search ratio and randomized search ratio for general weighted graphs ; the latter , in particular , appears to be quite a difficult problem that we believe will require the introduction of new techniques and approaches .",
    "a related question is whether the 5/4 approximation of the randomized search ratio for trees and unweighted graphs can be ( significantly ) improved .    another direction for future work is related to the _ continuous _ model . in this model , the hider may be located not only on a graph vertex , but on any given point across an edge .",
    "optimal strategies that minimize the deterministic search ratio are relatively easy to obtain  @xcite ; however , we do not yet have strategies that improve upon the straightforward approximations of the randomized search ratio .",
    "last , we note that the work that introduced the expanding search paradigm  @xcite raises several interesting optimization problems concerning the average search time of vertices of a graph ( assuming expanding search ) . in particular",
    ", one can define the _ expanding minimum latency problem _ , as the problem of minimizing the total latency of a graph , assuming an expanding search of the graph .",
    "is this problem np - hard in general graphs ?",
    "if yes , can one obtain constant - factor approximations ? is the general problem in the setting in which the search time of a vertex is weighted as hard as the unweighted variant",
    "? answers to the above questions will help provide an almost - complete picture of the computability and approximability of expanding search across a variety of performance measures .",
