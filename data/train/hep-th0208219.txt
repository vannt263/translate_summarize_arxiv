    "the single most important problem in trying to make contact between string-/m - theory and low - energy physics is probably the large number of degenerate and topologically distinct vacua of the theory .",
    "it is usually stated that non - perturbative effects will eventually lift most of this degeneracy . however , despite the advances over recent years in understanding non - perturbative string- and m - theory there is very little indication of progress in this direction .",
    "in fact , with the advent of m - theory and concepts such as branes and brane - world theories new classes of vacua have been constructed and , as a consequence , the degeneracy problem has perhaps grown even more serious .",
    "it seems worthwhile , therefore , to ask whether the cosmological evolution rather than inherent non - perturbative effects of the theory may play a prominent role in selecting the vacuum state .",
    "indeed , it is known that the degeneracy of some vacua ( particularly among those with a large number of supersymmetries ) will not be lifted non - perturbatively , suggesting cosmology will have some role to play .    the first task to tackle , in this context ,",
    "is the formulation of a workable theory capable of describing a number of topologically different vacua and transitions among them . as a second step",
    ", one will have to analyse the cosmological evolution of this theory .",
    "it is precisely these two problems which will be the main topic of the present paper .",
    "the class of vacua we will use in our approach is provided by compactification of heterotic m - theory  @xcite on calabi - yau three folds  @xcite resulting in five - dimensional brane - world theories  @xcite .",
    "these theories are defined on a space - time with two four - dimensional boundaries corresponding to the fixed planes of the orbifold @xmath0 and , in addition , may contain bulk three - branes which originate from m five - branes wrapping two - cycles in the calabi - yau space  @xcite .",
    "the associated effective actions are five - dimensional gauged @xmath1 supergravity theories in the bulk coupled to four - dimensional @xmath1 theories residing on the two boundaries and the three - branes .",
    "the prospects for particle - physics model building within this class of compactifications is quite promising and a number of models with attractive particle - physics properties on the `` observable '' boundary have been constructed  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the simplest way to characterise topologically different compactifications from the viewpoint of the five - dimensional effective theories is by using the charges @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the boundaries and the three - brane charge @xmath4 .",
    "these charges are not independent but must satisfy the cohomology constraint @xmath5 which follows from anomaly cancellation . two five - dimensional effective theories with different sets of charges @xmath6 originate from topologically distinct compactifications .",
    "a transition between two such theories may occur through a small - instanton transition  @xcite when a three - brane collides with one of the boundaries .",
    "the three - brane can then be `` absorbed '' by the boundary and , correspondingly , the boundary charge is changed by the amount carried by the incoming three - brane .",
    "this change in the boundary charge indicates a more dramatic transition in the boundary theory .",
    "for example , the gauge group and the amount of chiral matter  @xcite may be altered as a consequence of the internal topology change .",
    "the goal of this paper is to find a five - dimensional ( toy ) model which provides a unified description for the above class of topologically distinct vacua , in the simplest setting , and allows for transitions between them . while , for simplicity , we will assume that the topology of space - time both in the internal calabi - yau space and in the orbifold direction remains unchanged we will allow for transitions corresponding to a topology change in the internal gauge - field instantons on the boundaries and a change in the number and charges of three - branes .",
    "our basic method will be , starting with five - dimensional heterotic m - theory in its simplest form , to model the three - branes as topological defects  @xcite ( kinks ) of a new bulk scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "we do not claim , of course , that this model provides the correct definition of m - theory in these backgrounds .",
    "however , we do show that the defect model in the background of its various vacuum states reproduces the five - dimensional m - theory effective actions with different charges @xmath6 , corresponding to topologically distinct m - theory compactifications .",
    "time - evolution of the defect model and the scalar @xmath7 in particular then allows for a transition between these topologically distinct configurations .",
    "we will study in detail the simplest such transition , namely the collision of a three - brane kink with one of the boundaries .",
    "this will be done by calculating the four - dimensional effective action for the defect model in the background of such a kink .",
    "as we will see from this four - dimensional action , the collision process indeed generically leads to an absorption of the kink and a change in the boundary charge by the amount carried by the kink .",
    "hence , we have established the existence of one of the elementary topology - changing processes in our defect model .",
    "this opens up the possibility , subject of ongoing research , that a study of more complicated configurations , such as brane - networks , will provide insight into topological properties of brane - world models .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will introduce the five - dimensional effective actions from heterotic m - theory , in their simplest form . for later reference",
    ", we will also review the associated four - dimensional effective theories .",
    "section 3 then presents our defect model and explains how , precisely , it is related to the m - theory actions . in section 4 , we will compute the four - dimensional effective action for the defect model in the background of a kink and section 5 presents the resulting evolution equations .",
    "section 6 is devoted to a detailed study of the kink evolution and its collision with a boundary , based on these equations .",
    "a conclusion and outlook is presented in section 7 .",
    "to set the scene , we will now describe the five - dimensional brane world theories for which we would like to find a smooth defect - model .",
    "these brane - world theories can be viewed as a minimal version of five - dimensional heterotic m - theory  @xcite . for later purposes",
    ", it will also be useful to review the four - dimensional effective action associated to these brane - world theories .",
    "coordinates for the five - dimensional space @xmath8 are denoted by @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "we also introduce four - dimensional indices @xmath11 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath12 is compactified on an orbi - circle @xmath0 in the usual way , that is , by first compactifying @xmath13 on a circle with radius @xmath14 and then dividing by the @xmath15 orbifold action @xmath16 . taking the @xmath13coordinate in the range",

    "such non - supersymmetric heterotic models containing anti - branes have not been studied in much detail , so far .",
    "we have included this possibility here because it will naturally arise later in our discussion of the defect model .",
    "the generalisation to include more than one three - brane is straightforward .",
    "it simply amounts to replacing the nambu - goto type three - brane action in the third line of   by a sum over such actions ( with generally different three - brane charges ) and modifying the cohomology condition   and the definition of @xmath39 , eq .  , accordingly .",

    "as we will see , our defect model , to be presented in the next section , will considerably improve on these points .",
    "we would now like to find a `` smooth '' model , replacing the five - dimensional action  , where the three - brane is not put in `` by hand '' but , rather , obtained as defect solution to the theory .",

    "for the lower sign , on the other hand , there is no chance to satisfy the boundary conditions and , hence , no solutions of the type considered here exist in this case .",
    "the interpretation of these results is straightforward .",

    "while the latter represents a bps solution of the theory , the former carries the wrong orientation to be compatible with the boundaries and , in fact , will only exist as a dynamical object .",

    "specifically , we have @xmath118 to the left of the kink and @xmath119 to the right . inserting this into the equations  , and the boundary conditions  , for @xmath102 and @xmath25 and solving the resulting system precisely leads to the bps three - brane solution given by eqs .  , , .",
    "the charges @xmath33 appearing in this solution are given by @xmath120 where we have used our earlier identification   of the superpotential value @xmath99 with the elementary charge unit @xmath36 .",

    "more generally , we would like to discuss the relation between the action   in the background of a kink solution and the m - theory action  . to do this",
    ", we should allow for fluctuations of the kink .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that , for sufficiently small width , the hypersurface prescribed by the kink s core is a minimal surface and is , therefore , adequately described by a nambu - goto action .",
    "practically , this implies that the kinetic term for @xmath7 and the @xmath83 potential term in the action   can be effectively replaced by a nambu - goto action describing the dynamics of the core of the kink .",
    "of course , this core has to be identified with the three - brane in the m - theory model .",
    "it is easy to show that , by virtue of eq .",
    ", the tension in this effective nambu - goto action is given by @xmath36 which is the correct value for a single - charged three - brane with @xmath121 .",
    "further , the superpotential @xmath81 in such a kink background can be effectively replaced by a step - function , as discussed above . using the identification   of charges , it is easy to see that the superpotential @xmath81 precisely equals the function @xmath39 , defined in eq .",
    ", in this limit . as a consequence , the second potential term in proportional to @xmath122 precisely reproduces the bulk potential in the m - theory action  .",
    "similarly , the boundary potentials in match the boundary potentials in using that @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "although there are no bps anti - kink solutions , it is clear that a similar argument can be made for the action   in the background of an anti - kink leading to the m - theory action   with an anti - three - brane .    in summary , we have seen that the action   in the background of various vacuum configurations of the field @xmath7 reproduces different versions of the m - theory effective action  . for a constant field @xmath7 located in one of the minima of @xmath83",
    ", we have reproduced the m - theory action without three - branes . for a kink ( anti - kink ) background with sufficiently small width away from the boundaries we have obtaining the m - theory action with a single - charged three - brane ( anti - three - brane ) .",
    "note that , while from the viewpoint of the smooth model   these cases merely correspond to different configurations of the field @xmath7 , they represent different effective actions on the m - theory side .",
    "as we have discussed , these different effective actions arise from topologically distinct compactifications of the 11-dimensional m - theory .",
    "while these compactifications are known to be related by topology - changing transitions such as small - instanton transitions these processes can not be described by the action  .",
    "what we have seen is , that our smooth defect model incorporates a number of these topologically distinct configurations within a single theory and , may , describe transitions between them as the scalar field @xmath7 evolves in time . in the subsequent sections , we will study the simplest example for such a transition , namely the collision of a kink with one of the boundaries .    a final comment concerns the question of multi - charged branes .",
    "clearly , multi - charged bps three - branes with @xmath125 are allowed in the m - theory model  .",
    "however , our defect model   does not have exact bps multi - kink solutions as long as the potential @xmath83 is smooth at its minima .",
    "the reason is that , for smooth @xmath83 , a kink solution does not reach a minimum within a finite distance , as can be easily seen from eq .   with @xmath83",
    "expanded around a minimum . as a consequence ,",
    "single - kink solutions can not be `` stacked '' to produce exact multi - kink solutions .",
    "there are a number of options available to remove this apparent discrepancy .",
    "firstly , the model   as stands does have approximate multi - kink solutions ( with exponential accuracy ) which could be identified with multi - charged three - branes . secondly ,",
    "if the potential @xmath83 is continuous but non - smooth at its minima a kink solution can reach a minimum within a finite distance .",

    "as we have already mentioned , the distance by which the kink moves is a free parameter so a collision may never occur .",
    "then , this solution describes the full evolution of the system as far as it is accessible within the four - dimensional effective theory . on the other hand , if initial conditions are chosen so that a collision does occur , the particular solution   will determine the velocities @xmath298 , @xmath299 and @xmath300 right before the collision .",
    "we can then , approximately , identify @xmath301 , @xmath302 and @xmath303 and apply the previous results for the evolution at @xmath181 .",
    "one concludes that only for a very low - impact collision with small @xmath298 and an orbifold size which , at collision , decreases less rapidly than the dilaton , that is @xmath304 and @xmath305 , does @xmath56 converge to a constant .",
    "otherwise @xmath56 diverges to @xmath273 and this can , in fact , be viewed as the generic case .    of course , the criteria above may be somewhat inaccurate since we have ignored the complicated structure of the evolution equations near the boundary .",
    "we have , therefore , numerically integrated the full system   to test the above criteria for the outcome of a collision process .",
    "it turns out that , in broad terms , the picture remains qualitatively the same .",
    "starting with @xmath56 near zero inside the @xmath204 $ ] interval , we went around the ellipse @xmath306 .",
    "note that in this case the exact identity can not be observed since the constraint equation eq .",
    "includes an extra term proportional to @xmath307 .",
    "nevertheless the correction is always small since we set @xmath308 to a large negative value .",
    "this makes the initial value for @xmath309 very small and allows us , for the cases where @xmath166 grows , to follow the evolution for longer times until @xmath310 and the four - dimensional effective theory breaks down .",
    "we also chose a large initial @xmath311 so that @xmath312 remains as small as possible during the evolution , for the cases with @xmath313 . in all cases we set @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "for each of these sets of initial conditions we then varied @xmath298 from zero upwards and looked for changes in the large time behaviour of @xmath56 .",
    "the numerical results were obtained by evolving eqs .",
    " using a fourth - order fixed step runge - kutta method .",
    "the accuracy of the method was checked by confirming that the constraint equation eq .",
    "was satisfied throughout the evolution .",
    "the individual terms on the left hand side of eq .   should sum to 3 , and typically after 2000 time - steps of size 0.01 the deviation from this value was smaller than 0.01% .",
    "in the worst cases , where the equations of motion are no longer valid because one of the assumptions have broken down , the sum never gets above 0.2%    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we have an example of the first type of behaviour , for a small negative value of @xmath316 . after crossing the boundary at @xmath317 the kink relaxes to a stable constant solution .",
    "for early times this solution matches the one obtained from the m - theory effective action for the same initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , as soon as the kink approaches the boundary the two start differing , converging to different asymptotic values .     for the kink ( solid line ) and m - theory three - brane ( dashed line ) as a function of the scale factor @xmath39 .",
    "the initial conditions have been chosen as @xmath318 , @xmath319 , @xmath320 , @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 _ , width=340,height=340 ]    for a slightly higher value of the initial velocity the difference is even more striking , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in this case @xmath56 diverges in finite time , indicating that we are above the critical velocity .",
    "this third case turns out to be the most common , as already observed in the simplified system . only for @xmath313 and @xmath324 and @xmath298 below the critical velocity",
    "does the system avoid singular behaviour .     but with @xmath325.__,width=340,height=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have an example for a solution corresponding to case 2 . here",
    "both @xmath316 and @xmath326 are negative and we are below the critical velocity . as a consequence of @xmath327 , @xmath56 does not relax to a constant but its magnitude increases exponentially instead .",
    "in this case the solution has to be taken with care , since @xmath312 quickly becomes large in the exponential regime and the equations of motion stop providing a reliable approximation .    finally we have checked that once we go above the critical velocity , @xmath56 always diverges for finite @xmath328 .",
    "it is well known that in @xmath329 theory when a kink anti - kink collision takes place , above a certain limit velocity , they reflect and bounce back @xcite ( for lower velocities they can either reflect or form a bound state ) .",
    "this behaviour is a consequence of a resonance effect between the kink pair and higher field modes , so we should not be surprised not to observe it in the context of our four - dimensional effective action .",
    "this does not yet exclude the possibility of a bounce in a high - velocity regime which is accessible only in the context of the full five dimensional theory , a question which is currently under investigation  @xcite .     for the kink ( solid line ) and m - theory three - brane ( dashed line ) as a function of the scale factor @xmath39 .",
    "the initial conditions have been chosen as @xmath318 , @xmath330 , @xmath320 , @xmath331 , @xmath332 , @xmath333__,width=340,height=340 ]    what do these results imply in terms of the five - dimensional defect model  ?",
    "as we have seen , if @xmath56 starts its evolution within the interval @xmath204 $ ] and subsequently collides with a boundary ( at @xmath317 ) it is generically driven to @xmath273 very rapidly .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath56 kinetic energy remains finite at this singularity .",
    "nevertheless , we do expect the effective four - dimensional theory to break down eventually , as @xmath146 .",
    "this is because some of the higher - order term we have neglected are likely to grow with @xmath56 , in a way similar to the linear @xmath56 term in eq .  .",
    "however , at least for sufficiently small expansion parameters @xmath166 and @xmath229 the four - dimensional theory will be valid some way into the singularity .",
    "hence , we can conclude that a five - dimensional kink , interpolating between the vacua @xmath144 and @xmath110 which collides with the boundary at @xmath317 effectively disappears and leaves the field @xmath7 in the vacuum state @xmath110 ( and an analogous statement holds for collision with the boundary at @xmath334 ) . from the m - theory perspective",
    ", such a process corresponds to a transition @xmath335 between two different sets of charges and , hence , topologically different compactifications .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a toy defect model for five - dimensional heterotic brane - world theories , where three - branes are modelled by kink solutions of a bulk scalar field @xmath7 .",
    "we have shown that the vacuum states of this defect model correspond to a class of topologically distinct m - theory models characterised by the charges @xmath336 and @xmath337 on the boundaries and the three - brane charge @xmath338 .",
    "specifically , we have seen that a state where @xmath7 equals one of the minima @xmath339 of the potential , where @xmath86 , corresponds to a state with charges @xmath340 , that is , an m - theory model without three - branes .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath7 represents a kink solution interpolating between the minima @xmath341 and @xmath110 the associated m - theory charges are @xmath342 corresponding to a model with a single - charged three - brane .    we have computed the effective four - dimensional action associated to a kink solution and have studied the time - evolution of a kink in this context .",
    "our results show that , generically , a collision of the kink with a boundary will lead to a transition between the two types of vacua mentioned above .",
    "in other words , the kink will disappear after collision which corresponds to a transition between a state with a single - charged three brane and a state without a three - brane .",
    "there are several interesting directions which may be pursued on the basis of these results . clearly ,",
    "our original m - theory model as well as the associated defect model are rather simple and a number of possible extension and modifications come to mind .",
    "first of all , we may try to modify our defect model by including more than one additional bulk scalar field , in particular to allow for exact bps multi - kink solutions .",
    "one may ask whether the defect model can be embedded into a five - dimensional @xmath1 supergravity theory as is the case for the original m - theory model .",
    "further , there are a number of generalisations of five - dimensional heterotic m - theory , such as including a more general set of moduli fields  @xcite , which one may try to implement into the defect model . for example , including the general set of kahler moduli would allow one to study topological transitions of the underlying calabi - yau space through flops , in addition to the types of topology change considered in this paper .    perhaps the most interesting direction is to study the evolution of more complicated configurations of our defect model  .",
    "for example , one could envisage evolving the field @xmath7 from some initial ( say thermal ) distribution to see which type of brane - network develops at late time  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one would like to answer the important question whether the system can evolve from a brane - gas to a brane - world state .",
    "if this is indeed what happens such an approach will lead to predictions for the late - time brane - world that has evolved , given a certain class of plausible initial states .",
    "concretely , within the context of the simple model presented in this paper , we may expect predictions for the charges @xmath343 in this case .",
    "as we have discussed , the values of these charges are correlated with important properties of the theory such as the type of gauge group .",
    "optimistically , we may therefore hope that our approach leads to prediction for such important low - energy data , at least within a restricted class of associated m - theory compactifications .",
