    "recent work@xcite on medium - stimulated gluon radiation from fast partons traversing ( hot and cold ) qcd matter starts from the assumption , that the properties of the medium and its interactions with the energetic quark or gluon projectile do not change with time , i.e. the basic parameters @xmath2 , which is the typical transverse momentum given to the parton by a single scattering in the medium , and the parton s mean free path @xmath3 are kept constant in time .",
    "it also means in particular that the temperature @xmath4 remains constant during the time the parton is passing through the qcd plasma .    in this paper",
    "we study analytically the propagation of a quark , of high energy @xmath5 , traversing an hot qcd medium , i.e. we investigate jet broadening , induced gluon radiation and the resulting radiative energy loss of the quark .",
    "thereby we extend the analysis of @xcite to the case of time - dependent parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we follow bdmps @xcite , and we take into account our recent work @xcite , in which we also show the equivalence of our approach with b. zakharov s @xcite formulation of the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite for qcd .    for simplicity we consider a high energy quark entering and passing through a hot qcd medium .",
    "we may imagine the medium to be a quark - gluon plasma produced in a relativistic central @xmath6 collision , which occurs at @xmath7 . at time",
    "@xmath8 the quark enters the homogeneous plasma at high temperature @xmath9 , which expands longitudinally with respect to the collision axis .",
    "we may consider @xmath8 to be the thermalization time .",
    "for most of our results the limit @xmath10 can be taken with impunity .",
    "we shall also state results for the more realistic situation where the quark is produced at @xmath11 the ( not yet thermalized ) medium .",
    "the quark , for simplicity , is assumed to propagate in the transverse direction with vanishing longitudinal momentum , such that its energy is equal to its transverse momentum . on its way through the plasma the quark hits layers of matter which are cooled down due to the longitudinal expansion .",
    "we also assume that the plasma lives long enough so that the quark is able to propagate a given distance @xmath1 within the quark - gluon phase of matter .",
    "the properties of the expanding plasma are described by the hydrodynamical model proposed by bjorken @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on temperature , and therefore on time .",
    "the main relation is the scaling law @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the proper time of the expanding medium ; at rapidity @xmath14 it coincides with the distance ( time ) the quark has propagated through the plasma .",
    "the power @xmath15 , which we approximate by a constant , may take values between @xmath16 and @xmath17 for an ideal fluid .",
    "let us state our main results for an expanding medium with @xmath18 .",
    "as for the static medium the transverse momentum broadening of the jet follows the random walk behaviour , namely the characteristic width @xmath19 is proportional to the path length @xmath1 . the radiative energy loss per unit distance , @xmath20 ,",
    "can be as large as 6 ( 2 ) times the corresponding loss in a static plasma at temperature @xmath21 .",
    "the number 6 ( 2 ) corresponds to the situation where the quark enters the expanding plasma from ( is produced the plasma ) .",
