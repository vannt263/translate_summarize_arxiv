    "following the relation between the black hole ( bh ) mass , , and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath1 , ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a similar relation was found for the velocity dispersion @xmath2 of the  5007  line ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that originates from the narrow - line region ( nlr ) gas of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the nlr gas is thought to be mostly gravitationally bound to the bulge in high - luminosity agns ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , unlike the broad - line region gas that is virialized due its proximity to the bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "this relation is useful for systems in which the stellar absorption lines can not be observed , e.g. , because of dilution of the stellar light by the agn continuum .",
    "in addition to this relation ,  and the luminosity @xmath3 of the 5100  optical continuum , , are correlated in agns with bh measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are two main advantages to expanding such relations in the mid - infrared ( mir ) .",
    "the first is that the and ions emitting at 14.32 and 25.89  can not be easily excited by star - forming regions since they have ionization potentials @xmath4 of 97.12 and 54.93 ev .",
    "the second reason is the low obscuration , which allows for the results to be applied to type 2 agns . in this letter",
    ", we investigate for relations between  and  with mir nlr line velocity dispersions and luminosities .",
    "our sources were selected from a sample of 35 local agns that have  measurements from reverberation experiments ( @xcite ) . archival high - resolution _ spitzer",
    "_  infrared spectrograph ( irs ) data are available for 28 reverberation - mapped agns . of these ,",
    "eight were previously observed with the _ infrared space observatory _ short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) in high resolution ( @xcite ) .    to reduce the irs data we first averaged all images at the same nod position , rejecting pixels that deviated from the median image by more than 5 times its standard deviation .",
    "we computed the uncertainty image and then created the bad - pixel mask and extracted the spectrum of each nod position using the _ spitzer _  data reduction packages irsclean and spice .",
    "for the spectral extraction , we assumed a point - source spatial distribution for the high - ionization lines , corresponding to an unresolved nlr .",
    "when present , we removed the weak  and   lines at 14.37 and 25.99 , 1000 and 1200  longward of  and .",
    "we fitted the  and  lines and their underlying continua using gaussian and second - order polynomial functions , respectively , which was a good approximation for most cases .",
    "we considered resolved all lines with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the instrumental resolution @xmath7 at a given wavelength divided by 2.35 , @xmath8 is the error of @xmath6 , and @xmath9 is the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "the error of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , is computed as @xmath11 .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 is the standard deviation of the @xmath9 values that are obtained when using different polynomial coefficients to describe the local continuum .",
    "it encapsulates uncertainties in the continuum level and slope .",
    "the instrumental resolution and its error were measured as a function of wavelength using standard irs calibration targets ( p cygni , hd 190429 , hd 174638 ) .",
    "the average value of @xmath7 in the 14.0@xmath1318.0  range is 494@xmath1459 . between 25.0 and 34.2 , it is equal to 503@xmath1463 .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersions of the resolved lines were computed as @xmath15 and are presented in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "examples of lines resolved with irs are given in figure  [ fig : ex ] .",
    "to complement the _ spitzer _ data and to compute the widths of unresolved lines , we used sws spectra presented in @xcite .",
    "sws has a higher resolution ( @xmath16160  at 14.32  and @xmath16230  at 25.89 ) but lower sensitivity than irs .",
    "it detected only the brightest  and  lines , the velocity dispersions of which are presented in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    "to fit the relations between the mir line and the bh properties , we used the fitexy algorithm that takes into account the error bars in both axes ( @xcite ) and that treats all variables symmetrically ( @xcite ) .",
    "the  relation of the mir high - ionization lines is presented in figure  [ fig : ms ] .",
    "its best - fit solution is @xmath17 with parameter values corresponding to @xmath18 and @xmath19 for  and @xmath20 and @xmath21 for .",
    "the scatter values of the relation along the  axis are 0.55 and 0.51 dex for  and , respectively .",
    "its spearman rank coefficients are 0.66 and 0.77 , assigning probabilities @xmath22 of 5.0@xmath23 and 8.3@xmath24 to the null hypothesis that the variables are correlated by chance .",
    "we excluded all sources with @xmath25  from this fit since the irs resolution is insufficient to provide @xmath2 measurements on the left - hand side of the relation and since no sws measurements are available for such  values .",
    "moreover , ic4329a is not used in the fit since its light curves are not indicative of the presence of a bh ( @xcite ) .",
    "given that the best - fit slope agrees within the errors with that of the @xcite formula , the latter can be alternatively used to derive  from   and .",
    "if we fix the slope to @xmath26 and solve for @xmath27 using the idl routine mpfit , we find that @xmath28 and @xmath29 for  and .      following the suggestion that the luminosity of  can be used as a proxy of   ( @xcite ) , we find that  and  are related to the 5100@xmath0 continuum luminosity ( fig .  [",
    "fig : ff ] ) as @xmath30 and they are computed for @xmath31=70  mpc@xmath32 , @xmath33=0.3 , and @xmath34=1 .",
    "the best - fit parameter values are @xmath35 and @xmath36 for   and @xmath37 and @xmath38 for .",
    "the scatter values of the relation are 0.46 and 0.47 dex and its spearman rank coefficients are 0.85 and 0.81 for  and , respectively , corresponding to probabilities @xmath22 of 3.7@xmath39 and 7.5@xmath39 .",
    "the relations continue to hold when plotting the 5100@xmath0 continuum versus the mir line fluxes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] ) . in the flux - flux diagram ,",
    "the only outlier is pg 1226 + 023 ( 3c 273 ) , which is the brightest palomar - green qso ( @xcite ) .",
    "a correlation similar to that found in the optical between  and  exists in the mir between  and  or  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ml ] ) .",
    "its best fit is @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 for , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 for .",
    "its scatter values are 0.46 and 0.50 dex and its spearman rank coefficients are 0.76 and 0.69 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 for  and , respectively .",
    "we note that upper limits have not been used for the fit .",
    "examples of lines resolved with irs . the  profile is given for pg2130 + 099 ( solid line , diamonds ) and mrk279 ( dashed line , stars ) .",
    "the resolution element is plotted as a dotted line.,width=226 ]             the relation between  and the luminosity of the mir nlr lines .",
    "the symbols are as in figure  [ fig : ff ] .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to a fixed eddington rate of 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1 from top to bottom .",
    "they were horizontally shifted by a factor of 1000 to overlap with the luminosity range of the mir nlr lines.,width=264 ]",
    "the relations between ,  and  indicate that the nlr gas kinematics are primarily determined by the potential of the bulge , as it is also believed based on the  line profiles ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,  and  are on average 67 and 62  higher than @xmath1 , and 51 and 32  higher than .",
    "such discrepancies could be attributed to an increase of the line width with increasing @xmath4 , which is often found for optical nlr lines ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that ions with high ionization potentials have high velocity dispersions because they are located in nlr clouds that are close to the bh sphere of influence . since the and ,",
    "mostly , the ions are predominantly excited by agns , the mir  relation can be applied even in systems that undergo starbursts .",
    "it can also be applied in type 2 agns since the lines suffer little from extinction . moreover ,  and  can be used as surrogates for @xmath1 in environments where measuring @xmath1 is hard , such as in bright qsos . however , the relation does not necessarily hold for agns with strong winds and jets such as luminous radio sources ( @xcite ) , and for agns with high eddington rates ,  ( @xcite ) .",
    "such systems can be recognized by the asymmetric wings or the high kurtosis of their line profiles ( whittle 1985a ; 1992 ) .",
    "the luminosities of the broad lines ( @xcite ) and the narrow lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] ) scale with  and with the bolometric agn luminosity , , since they depend on the absolute accretion rate onto the central object . specifically ,  is equal to , , and , where @xmath47 is a wavelength - dependent bolometric correction factor . for @xmath489 ( @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) and for the median values of /  and /  in our sample , we find that @xmath4813000 and @xmath484500 . that the relation does not have a slope of unity",
    "could indicate that  and   depend on @xmath3 in a manner different than  does .",
    "@xcite found that the equivalent width of  decreases with increasing .",
    "this behaviour could be attributed to a different geometric distribution of nlr clouds around the agn at different luminosities . whether the  or  luminosity of a source can be used to derive its  partly depends on its eddington rate . to illustrate how changes of  affect the relation between the luminosity of a mir line and",
    ", we overplot lines of constant   in figure  [ fig : ml ] .",
    "the more quiescent a source is , the more its position is shifted to the top left corner of this diagram .",
    "equation  ( [ rel3 ] ) is valid within the  range 0.003@xmath130.6 that our sources span , and implies that the mass of a bh determines its luminosity output .",
    "its advantage is that it can be applied to sources with obscured optical continua or underestimated  luminosities , such as type 2 agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "however its scatter is likely to be larger than that presented in ",
    "[ sec : mir_opt ] since the eddington rates of the reverberation - mapped agns are not necessarily representative of those of all local agns .",
    "we conclude that the mir nlr gas kinematics trace  in local reverberation - mapped agns in a manner similar to stellar kinematics .",
    "the  and   line widths can be used to estimate .",
    "the calibration of  and to  provides a new method to compute bolometric luminosities , black hole masses , and eddington rates in various types of agns , including highly obscured systems , albeit with a large scatter .",
