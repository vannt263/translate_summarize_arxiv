    "understanding protoplanetary disks is not only essential for understanding the star formation process , it is also critical for understanding planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the lifetime of protoplanetary disks is one of the most fundamental parameters of a protoplanetary disk because it directly restricts the time for planet formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "many studies that derive the lifetime of protoplanetary disks are now available . in a pioneering work ,",
    "@xcite studied the frequency of disk - harbouring stars with known ages in the taurus molecular cloud that have a @xmath3-band excess and suggested that the disk lifetime is in the range from @xmath73myr to @xmath210myr .",
    "subsequently , a more direct method using the ` disk fraction ' , which is the frequency of near - infrared ( nir ) or mid - infrared ( mir ) excess stars within a young cluster _ with an assumed age _ , has been widely adopted to study the disk lifetime following the work by @xcite and @xcite . using the disk fraction that monotonically decreases as a function of cluster age , the disk lifetime",
    "is estimated at about 510myr in the solar neighborhood (; see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite compiled disk fractions for about 20 clusters and derived the characteristic disk decay time - scale ( @xmath8 ) of 2.5myr , assuming the disk @xmath9 \\propto \\exp ( - t[{\\rm myr } ] / \\tau)$ ] .",
    "these estimated disk lifetimes were mainly derived from the disk fraction with all detected cluster members and thus the estimated lifetime has been primarily for low - mass stars ( @xmath102@xmath1 ) , considering the characteristic mass of the initial mass function ( imf ) ( @xmath20.3@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the typical stellar mass detection limit ( @xmath20.1@xmath1 ) .",
    "however , a number of assessments of the effect of the stellar mass dependence of the disk lifetime have recently suggested a shorter disk lifetime for the higher - mass stars . although the existence of disks of high - mass stars ( @xmath118@xmath1 ) is still under debate , the disks of i m stars have been extensively studied and are well characterized @xcite .",
    "i m stars with optically thick disks are known as herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars .",
    "they were originally discovered with strong emission - lines by @xcite .",
    "after @xcite established the method for selecting haebe stars using the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) slope from the @xmath12-band to the iras 12-@xmath13 m band , @xcite derived the haebe - star disk fraction for six clusters in the age range of 310myr .",
    "they showed that the disk fraction is lower compared to the previously derived disk fraction for low - mass ( lm ) stars , in particular by a factor of @xmath210 lower at @xmath23myr .",
    "recently , the disk fraction studies have shifted to longer wavelengths ( mir or submm ) mainly because of the interest in tracing the outer disk , where most of the disk mass resides @xcite .",
    "however , the disk fractions can also be estimated using only _ jhk _ data , in particular , for the i m stars .",
    "originally , the disk lifetime was estimated with disk fractions derived by using the color  color diagram based on imaging in the _ jhk _ and _ jhkl _ photometric bands .",
    "after the advent of the _ spitzer space telescope _ , the sed slope ( @xmath14 ) in the mir wavelength range ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath13 m ) is used for selecting disk - harbouring stars ( e.g. @xmath15 ; @xcite ) . however , the derived disk fractions and disk lifetime with _ spitzer _",
    "data were found to be almost the same as those with _ jhkl _",
    "data ( see ) , and even with _ jhk _",
    "data @xcite .",
    "although the nir disk fractions are known to show values systematically smaller and with a larger uncertainty due to contamination of the non  disk - harbouring stars on the colour  colour diagram , @xcite showed that the _ jhk _ colour  colour diagram can clearly distinguish disk - harbouring i m stars from non - disk i m stars .",
    "the _ jhk _",
    "disk fraction value is robust both because of the large infrared excess and the higher stellar effective temperature of the i m stars , compared to lm stars .    in this paper",
    ", we derived the _",
    "jhk _ imdf using the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog of a large number ( @xmath220 ) of well - established nearby ( @xmath16kpc ) young clusters with an age span of 0 to @xmath210myr in order to quantitatively and comprehensively study the lifetime of protoplanetary disks surrounding i m stars ( @xmath01.57@xmath1 ) .",
    "in particular , we included as many clusters as possible with ages @xmath105myr . to securely identify i m cluster members , we made use of the spectral types of each cluster member from the literature , assuming a single age for each cluster . with the",
    "derived _ jhk _ imdfs for a large number of younger clusters ( @xmath105myr ) , we estimated the disk lifetime of the i m stars .",
    "we then estimated the stellar mass dependence of the disk lifetime by comparing the lifetime of i m stars to that of lm stars .",
    "we also derived the mir imdfs with _",
    "data in the literature to compare them to the _ jhk _ imdfs .",
    "we found that the derived _ jhk _ imdfs are significantly lower than the mir imdfs , in particular at younger ages ( @xmath103myr ) , which results in shorter lifetime of the @xmath3 disk than the mir disk .",
    "this suggests a potentially larger fraction of ` transition disks ' for i m stars compared to those for lm stars .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for dust growth and planet formation .    because the sample clusters and the selection of the i m stars is critical for this paper , we discuss this in detail in section  [ sec : sample ] . the definition and derivation of the _ jhk _ imdf and the mir imdf",
    "are described in sections  [ sec : jhk imdf ] and @xmath17  [ sec : mir imdf ] , respectively . before interpreting the results of the imdfs ,",
    "the definition of the disk lifetime is discussed in section  [ sec : def_time ] .",
    "section  [ sec : kdisk ] then discusses the results for _ jhk _ imdfs .",
    "the mid - ir disk fraction is discussed in section  7 .",
    "subsequently , section  [ sec : df_nir_mir ] discusses the large difference between _ jhk _ and mir imdfs found in this study and potential disk evolution consequences for i m stars .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : physical ] discusses the possible physical mechanisms of this rapid evolution of the @xmath3 disk . at the end , in section",
    "[ sec : planet ] , we briefly discuss possible implications for planet formation .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes this paper .",
    "we selected our target clusters from previous studies of the disk fraction / disk evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for estimating the disk lifetime with acceptable accuracy , it is necessary to derive the imdfs for as many as young clusters as possible , ideally more than ten .",
    "we thus selected our target young clusters from the above papers , but with the following criteria : ( 1 ) cluster ages are spaced from 0 to @xmath210myrs , to cover the time period of disk dispersal . ( 2 ) the cluster membership is well defined from a variety of observations ( astrometry , radial velocity , variability , h@xmath18 , x - ray , nir excess , mir excess , optical spectroscopy , nir spectroscopy , etc . ) .",
    "this criterion naturally leads to clusters in the solar neighborhood ( distance @xmath101.5kpc ) .",
    "( 3 ) the spectral types of a large number of cluster members are available by spectroscopy . ( 4 ) well - defined nir and mir photometry of the cluster members with @xmath19@xmath1 is published or in a widely available catalogue , such as 2mass .",
    "( 5 ) at least three i m stars are available per cluster for imdf derivation .",
    "the resultant 19 target clusters are summarized in table [ tab : clusters ] along with the age , distance , and references for the disk fraction study .",
    "almost all young ( @xmath105myr ) clusters in the references ( table [ tab : clusters ] ) are included , though three young clusters ( mbm 12 , ngc 6231 , and ngc 7129 ) are excluded .",
    "this is because it appears that no i m stars are present in mbm 12 @xcite and the spectral types of stars in ngc 6231 and ngc 7129 are limited only to brightest members ( ob , a stars ) , and is not adequate to cover the entire i m star mass range down to 1.5@xmath1 . some older clusters ( @xmath205myr ) , mostly those from @xcite , are excluded because they do not satisfy the above criterion . for several well - known clusters within the target clusters ( trapezium , ori ob1a , ori ob1bc , per ob2 )",
    ", we could derive only _ jhk _ disk fractions because we could not find published _ spitzer _",
    "mir data for the i m stars , probably because of saturation . as a result",
    ", we obtained the _ jhk _",
    "imdf for 19 clusters and the mir imdf for 13 clusters .",
    "although the original definition of mass for haebe is @xmath2210@xmath1 with spectral types of b and a ( and in a few cases f ) @xcite , the presence of disks around stars earlier than b5 ( @xmath067@xmath1 in the main - sequence phase ) is not well established since the disk lifetime of high - mass stars is very rapid , e.g. @xmath21myr . also , the number of high - mass stars ( @xmath2067@xmath1 ) is very small because of the imf , and the number stochastically fluctuates from cluster to cluster .",
    "therefore , we set the upper - mass limit as 7@xmath1 in this paper .",
    "this is also a good match with the mass range of the isochrone model by @xcite ( @xmath21 ) , which is used throughout this paper . as for the lower - mass limit",
    ", we employed 1.5@xmath1 , which corresponds to spectral type ` f1 ' for main sequences , following past comprehensive works of disks for i m stars by @xcite and @xcite . the latter",
    "defined a mass range bin of 1.5@xmath227@xmath1 , which can be directly compared to our results .",
    "the i m star selection is a critical item for this study .",
    "ideally , stellar mass and the age of each cluster member are determined from the hr diagram with the extinction - corrected luminosity and spectroscopically determined effective temperature through an isochrone model . however",
    ", this requires a time - consuming observational program , and thus the number of target clusters is limited as in the previous studies .",
    "even if we had the complete observational data , the value of mass and age depends on the isochrone model , and could strongly depend on the extinction correction with different r@xmath23 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "another approach is to use a limited number of parameters , such as only the spectral type , to pick up cluster members in a broad mass range , such as i m or lm stars , and to use a larger number of clusters .",
    "although sacrificing the accuracy of the mass estimate , a study including a larger number of clusters is possible .",
    "although some past studies , in fact , focus on targets of certain spectral types ( e.g. earlier than f1 ) to pick up i m stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , _ the true mass for a star of a certain spectral type varies with the age of the star _ , and such spectral - type  limited samples should be viewed with caution ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume the cluster age is the age of the members in the selection of the i m stars .",
    "the choice of the isochrone model is critical for the mass estimate .",
    "although a number of recent isochrone models are available , we choose @xcite because it is the most used isochrone track in the target mass range with the reliability through various tests and application to many observational data . using dynamically and kinematically determined stellar masses",
    ", @xcite confirmed that virtually any isochrone model provides similar mass estimate for masses more than 1.2@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite also noted that the introduction of new isochrone models tend to bring new systematic uncertainty and should be used with caution .",
    "for this study , using siess s isochrone is also critical for comparison with the previous studies which used siess s isochrone in most cases ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we take particular note of the fact that the age spread of young clusters in the solar neighborhood is in many cases small enough so that a single age can be assumed for each cluster ( see table [ tab : clusters ] ) . therefore , the boundary masses of the i m stars ( 7 and 1.5@xmath1 ) theoretically correspond to a unique spectral type for each cluster , which enables i m star selection only with the spectral type of the members without considering differential extinction .",
    "this method should be effective , in particular , for i m stars because most of the time they evolve along the henyey track , which is roughly horizontal on the hr diagram , and even when the i m stars are on hayashi track before switching to the henyey track , the spectral type does not change because the track is almost vertical on the hr diagram .",
    "table [ tab : age ] shows the unique spectral types corresponding to the boundary masses for each cluster age based on the isochrone model by @xcite .",
    "however , there are several points to take note for using the above method in selecting the i m stars .",
    "first , each spectral type , in particular the later spectral type ( g7k5 ) , corresponds to a slightly broader mass range as shown in the third column of table [ tab : age ] .",
    "for example , the boundary spectral type k5 corresponds to 1.21.5@xmath1 for the age of 2myr .",
    "therefore , the sampling by spectral type naturally leads to the inclusion of stars with a mass of slightly lower than the nominal 1.5@xmath1 .",
    "next , note that the age spread of each cluster may cause contamination of lower - mass stars in our im - star samples in the case where the age of the star is older than the cluster age .",
    "table [ tab : age ] also shows the possible mass range for an age spread of @xmath24myr , which is the maximum possible age spread in most cases ( typically @xmath25myr : see table [ tab : clusters ] ) .",
    "although the age of most stars are within the age spread of 2myr , there are @xmath215% stars at most which are older than the age spread and are actually lower - mass stars ( see figs .",
    "15 in @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , the distance uncertainties of target clusters may also influence on the selection of the i m stars .",
    "the typical uncertainties of distance is about 10% for the clusters in the solar neighborhood . for the clusters studied by @xcite , the uncertainties are even smaller ( less than 5% ) with _ hipparcos _ data . for deriving the mass and age of a star on h - r diagram ,",
    "the effective temperature is independent of the distance because it is derived from spectroscopy , while luminosity is directly affected .",
    "however , the luminosity can differ by only 0.2mag with the assumed distance uncertainties , which then cause a mass difference of @xmath260.1@xmath1 around lower mass limit of this study , 1.5@xmath11myr for stars",
    "@xmath273myr and @xmath262myr for older stars .",
    "these differences are within the age spread ( 2myr ) we are considering . ] , from the isochrone models by @xcite in the target age range of this paper ( @xmath2711myr ) . because this mass uncertainty is very small",
    ", the distance uncertainties for the selection of i m stars does not affect our results .",
    "the above three points ( or any other unconsidered uncertainties ) might mask the possible lifetime difference between i m and lm stars .",
    "however , if we find any significant difference , it is likely to be real and should be clearly seen with better selected im - star samples in the future .",
    "note that contamination of higher - mass stars can occur , but that should not affect the lifetime differences between the disks of i m and lm stars .",
    "we discuss the effect of i m star selection on the derived imdf in section 8.1.2 .",
    "we searched the literature to gather all of the available spectral type information for the stars in the sample clusters .",
    "we then made a list of all the i m stars by selecting cluster members by spectral type earlier than that of the lower - mass boundary and also later than that of the higher - mass boundary .",
    "the clusters chosen are shown in column 1 and the references to the papers from which the i m stars were selected is shown in column 2 of table 3 . following the fifth criterion in section  2.1 ,",
    "we removed any target clusters for which less than three i m stars can be identified .",
    "also , because imdfs for clusters with age of @xmath205myr are found to be @xmath00per cent as discussed in the following sections , we obtained imdfs for only about 10 clusters .",
    "disk fractions for clusters with age of @xmath275myr are the most useful for studying stellar mass dependence of disk dispersal ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    as a result , the total number of stars used for deriving jhk and mir imdf become 799 and 365 , respectively . in appendix",
    "a , the i m star samples for all clusters are summarized in tables as well as in colour - colour diagrams .",
    "for the following five clusters , the spectral type information for lower - mass stars in the literatures is incomplete , and we could not reach to the mass - limit of 1.5@xmath1 : @xmath28 vel ( f5 :  2@xmath1 ) , @xmath29 ori ( g0 :  2@xmath1 ) , per ob2 ( g8:1.8@xmath1 ) , ob1bc ( g3 :  2.2@xmath1 ) , and ob1a ( g6:1.7@xmath1 ) .",
    "although it is desirable to set exactly the same mass limit , such as 2@xmath1 , we used 1.5@xmath1 as the lowest mass for the other clusters in order to obtain as many i m stars as possible . and confirmed that the resultant imdfs do not change within the uncertainty . ]",
    "the optical - nir sed difference between stars with and without disks is more prominent for i m stars than lm stars .",
    "this is mainly because the stellar sed for stars with higher masses peaks at the shorter wavelength side of the @xmath30 and @xmath31 bands ( e.g. @xmath20.3@xmath13 m for a0v stars , with mass of @xmath23@xmath1 and @xmath32 of 9790k ; @xcite ) compared to the disk sed that peaks near the @xmath3 band ( @xmath112@xmath13 m ) .",
    "haebe stars also have a large infrared excess from the optically thick disk ` wall ' , which arises from the inner edge of the disks and where dust disk is so hot as to evaporate ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , even in the case of using only _ jhk _ photometry , i m stars with disks can be much more easily and more accurately selected than lm stars with disks .",
    "indeed , @xcite found an intrinsic region for haebe stars on a _ jhk _ colour  colour diagram ( see their fig .  2 ) . also , the photometric uncertainties for i m stars in nearby clusters are very small , typically @xmath260.02mag for all _ jhk_-bands .",
    "we make use of these characteristics to derive the _ jhk _",
    "imdf for each target cluster with the selected sample of i m stars .      on the _ jhk _ colour  colour diagram ,",
    "the stars with disks are known to be lying in the infrared - excess region that is separated from the region of stars without disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for low - mass stars , disk fractions of various young clusters have been derived using _",
    "colour  colour diagram ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . for i m stars",
    ", @xcite showed that haebe stars occupy completely separated regions even from those for classical be ( cbe ) stars based on the modelling of disk emission .",
    "cbe stars show near - infrared excess from gaseous free - free emission and are often confused with haebe stars , but the disk excess from haebe stars is much larger .",
    "after @xcite defined the locus of haebe stars on the intrinsic _ jhk _ colour  colour diagram , @xcite identified haebe stars of ic 1805 using their definition .",
    "@xcite defined the disk excess region for haebe stars on the _ jhk _ colour  colour diagram ( non - intrinsic ) by using a line that passes through @xmath33 and is parallel to the reddening vector as a border - line between the haebe stars and cbe stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : her_all ] , we plot the _ observed _ colors of the haebe stars ( filled circles ) and the cbe stars ( open circles ) for all the samples in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* upper sco , lac ob1 , ori ob 1a , ori ob 1bc , and tr 37 ) on the _ jhk _ colour  colour diagram .",
    "this shows that the haebe stars are spatially separated from the main - sequence track ( * ? ? ?",
    "* black line in the colour  colour diagram ) .",
    "note that the data points shown are not corrected for reddening .",
    "there is a clear division between haebe stars and other objects , and a border - line can be set as the dot - dashed line , which passes through the point of @xmath34 and is parallel to reddening vector ( black arrow ) .",
    "this border - line is slightly shifted to the right compared to comern et al.s border - line ( fig .",
    "[ fig : her_all ] ) to completely avoid contamination from cbe stars .",
    "hereafter , we call the right - side region of the border - line the ` i m disk excess region ' ( orange shaded region ) .",
    "this border - line is more precise for dividing haebe stars and cbe stars than that of @xcite ( gray dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : her_all ] ) because some cbe stars are included in the i m disk excess region when using comeron s border - line .",
    "therefore , we use the line passing through @xmath35 as the border - line , and the _ jhk _ imdf is defined to be the ratio of the stars located in the i m disk excess region to the total number of stars in a cluster that are selected with the criteria in section  [ subsec : selection_imstars ] .",
    "note that there is a well - known classification for haebe stars by @xcite , group i for younger flared disk phase and group ii for older flat disk phase .",
    "we confirmed that all stars in group i and ii , except for one star ( hd 135344 in group i ) out of 14 stars , are recognized as haebe stars in our method .        .",
    "we used the 2mass point source catalog to obtain the _ jhk _ magnitudes of all the sample i m stars .",
    "we rejected all i m stars that do not have an ` a ' photometric quality flag ( signal - to - noise @xmath3610 for all _ jhk _ bands ) in the 2mass catalogue .",

    "the systematic errors of the disk fraction are known to be less than the statistical errors when using data with small photometric uncertainties ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the present data should be in the same situation in view of the small uncertainties in _ jhk _ photometry of the i m star samples . for estimating the statistical errors of the disk fraction , we assumed that the errors are dominated by poisson errors ( @xmath37 ) , and we used @xmath38 for the one - sigma uncertainty of the disk fraction , where @xmath39 is the number of stars with optically thick disks ( @xmath40 haebe stars ) and @xmath41 is the number of all cluster members , respectively .",

    "therefore , our finding suggests that such critical evolutionary events can be clearly recognized in the transition disk phase for i m stars as a time lag between the dispersal of the @xmath3 disk and the dispersal of the mir disk , while both events happen nearly simultaneously for the lm stars ( @xmath86myr ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the implications of the observed time - scales of the gas / dust disks on the mechanism of disk evolution of the i m stars .",
    "although there are many detailed processes related to disk evolution , we focus on discussing the following two categories , which are not intended to be comprehensive but broadly cover basic processes related to disk evolution : ( 1 ) the disk dispersal processes , such as mass accretion and dissipation by photoevaporation , and ( 2 ) the dust settling to the disk midplane and dust growth , which could be connected to planetesimal formation and planet formation .",
    "we suggest that the latter process is more likely for the early disappearance of the @xmath3 disks .    before discussing the detailed evolution mechanisms , we first remark on the radial configuration of the dust disk in the steady state . if we consider an optically thick disk for disks with ir excess , the radius ( @xmath101 ) with a temperature ( @xmath102 ) is given by @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the stellar luminosity and @xmath59 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",

    "9 ) , considering the effective temperatures of the central star ( see @xcite ) . because the radius @xmath101 of an optically thick disk with ir excess is expressed with @xmath111 , @xmath101 is proportional to @xmath112 with the mass - luminosity relation of @xmath113 @xcite . therefore , @xmath54 and @xmath114 should be roughly proportional to @xmath112 .",
    "the disk dispersal process consists of two kinds of processes : _ mass accretion _ onto the central star and _ dissipation _ into interstellar space @xcite .",
    "the combination of mass accretion and dissipation due to photoevaporation ( e.g. the so called  uv - switch model  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is thought to be one of the major mechanisms of overall disk dispersal @xcite , because this can explain the almost simultaneous dispersal of the entire disk ( @xmath86myr ) , and thus the short transition disk phase as implied in fig .",
    "[ fig : jhk_ha_mirdf_age ] ( right ) .",
    "although there are a number of other proposed dispersal mechanisms ( e.g. stellar encounter , disk wind ) , our discussion here focuses on the dispersal due to photoevaporation .",
    "the first possible mechanism for the short @xmath3-disk lifetime of the i m stars is the faster mass accretion onto the central star for higher - mass stars .",
    "@xcite suggested a very strong mass dependence of the mass accretion rate from observations of uv balmer excess .",
    "however , our results suggest that the gas accretion disk has a longer lifetime than the @xmath3 disk ( fig .  [",
    "fig : jhk_ha_mirdf_age ] , left ) , about equal to that of the mir disk . therefore , more rapid accretion and the resultant deficiency of material are not likely to be the cause of the faster destruction of the @xmath3 disk .",
    "photoevaporation is another strong candidate for the dispersal mechanism that may cause the short @xmath3-disk lifetime .",
    "photoevaporation is known to be effective for outside of the gravitational radius , @xmath115 , where the thermal energy balances with gravitational potential .",
    "this radius scales with the stellar mass as @xmath116 @xcite , and @xmath115 for i m stars ( 2.5@xmath1 ) and lm stars ( 0.5@xmath1 ) are @xmath225au and @xmath25au , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath3 disk radii ( @xmath54 ) for i m and lm stars are only @xmath20.3 and @xmath20.1au , respectively , which are less than @xmath117 of @xmath115 .",
    "similarly the corresponding mir disk radii are @xmath25 and @xmath21au , respectively .",
    "although all these radii change with the stellar mass ( from 1.5 to 7@xmath1 for i m stars ) , the relative magnitude of the radii , @xmath118 , should not change for both i m and lm star mass ranges , even considering the scaling with the stellar mass mentioned above .",
    "therefore , photoevaporation is not likely the main cause of the fast @xmath3-disk dispersal for i m stars .",
    "the transition disk phase is now interpreted as the most important phase in the standard planet formation scenario , and now much observational effort has been put into characterizing this phase @xcite . in this interpretation , the early disappearance of the innermost dust disk compared to other portions of disk is due to dust settling to disk mid - plane and/or dust growth .",
    "we discuss those possibilities in the following section with a schematic picture shown in fig .",
    "9 .      from the basic equations of protoplanetary disks in equilibrium , the radial dependence of the dust settling time",
    "can be analytically shown to be proportional to the kepler rotation period , which is proportional to @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "although there are many new simulations incorporating more physical processes to show the dust settling time with a different r- or m@xmath120-dependence ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we compare our results with this base relationship by @xcite as an initial consistency check .",
    "first , as for the radius @xmath121 dependence , the shorter @xmath3-disk lifetime than that of mir - disk for the i m stars ( fig .",
    "9 , right , table  [ tab : jhk_mir_timescale ] ) is qualitatively consistent with the base relationship in that the dust settling / growth is occurring more effectively in the inner disk .",
    "although the observed results ( @xmath122myr at @xmath105au , and @xmath1237myr at @xmath124au ) do not quantitatively follow the base @xmath125 relation and instead show a much weaker @xmath121-dependence , this can be interpreted as that the turbulent process or some other processes that prevent the dust settling / growth have the opposite @xmath121-dependence to reduce the @xmath121-dependence of dust settling / growth ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the lm stars , on the other hand , the lifetimes of the inner @xmath3 , mir , and the outer submm disks do not show any significant difference ( see discussions in section  8.1.1 and  8.2 ) .",
    "this is even more inconsistent with the base @xmath125 relation than the i m stars .",
    "most likely this means that the disk disperses before dust is totally settled in the entire disk , although dust settling / growth is reported for some lm stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this case , the dust in the upper disk layer is dissipated in the process of mass accretion and photoevaporation ( fig .",
    "9 , left ) , and the disk lifetime ( @xmath2910myr ) sets the lower limit of the dust setting / growth time - scale for most of the lm srars .",
    "however , it should be noted that the above discussion is intended to describe the typical case and is not applicable to all stars .",
    "the time scale of transition disk is still under debate , short ( @xmath20.2myr ; e.g. luhman et al .",
    "2010 ) or long ( @xmath2 a few myr ; e.g. sicilia- aguilar & currie 2011 ) , although the discrepancies among these studies are largely due to differing definitions of the transition disk and how to estimate the total disk lifetime @xcite .    next , as for the stellar mass @xmath4 dependence , the much shorter @xmath3-disk lifetime of the i m stars than that of the lm stars ( @xmath126myr , while @xmath12710myr ; see table  [ tab : jhk_mir_timescale ] ; fig .",
    "5 , left ) is apparently consistent with the base relation in that dust settling / growth occurring effectively for higher - mass stars . however ,",
    "if we also consider the @xmath121-dependence , the characteristic i m stars ( @xmath128@xmath1 , @xmath129au ) are expected to have longer settling time - scale ( about twice ) than the characteristic lm stars ( @xmath130@xmath1 , @xmath131au ) which shows the opposite tendency compared to the observed timescales . this might suggest that turbulence of the innermost disk is much weaker for the i m stars than for the lm stars so that the dust growth / settling occurs quickly .",
    "although the larger disk mass ( surface density ) for stars with higher mass @xcite might cause such a situation , the physical process is unknown .",
    "planetesimal and planet formation result from the dust settling / growth processes according to the standard core - accretion model @xcite . for i",
    "m stars , the quick dust settling / growth processes _ in the presence of gas _ may cause effective planetesimal formation @xcite .",
    "this results in effective jupiter - mass planet formation , which could accelerate the disappearance of the innermost disk with clearing by migration ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a scenario is consistent with the trend of a higher probability of jupiter - mass planets with a larger stellar mass for stars in the mass range of 0.21.9@xmath1 for semimajor axes of @xmath102.5au @xcite .",
    "however , the mass range for i m stars ( 1.57@xmath1 ) has only a small overlap with this trend .",
    "this trend is generally interpreted as a result of larger disk mass ( high surface density ) for larger stellar mass , which enables the rapid formation of jupiter - mass planets ( e.g. within 1myr ; @xcite ) .      in summary ,",
    "dust settling / growth ( and some planet formation ) can generally explain the shorter @xmath3-disk lifetime of i m stars , although the specific physical processes are not known .",
    "this interpretation is summarized in the schematic pictures shown in fig .",
    "9 ( right ) : ( 1 ) the @xmath3 disk ( @xmath105au ) : dust settling / growth works very efficiently from the beginning of disk evolution ( cluster age @xmath40 0 ) and is almost completed in @xmath23myr . because there is no left - over ir - emitting grains even in the upper disk layer , no nir continuum is emitted , ( 2 ) the mir disk ( @xmath132au ) : a significant amount of dust grains are in the upper disk layer due to the turbulence and give rise to the mir continuum emission .",
    "after @xmath245myr , dust settling has occurred , or dust in the upper layer of the mir disk is dissipated , resulting in no emission of mir  thermal continuum emission .",
    "if this picture is correct , the lifetime difference of _ jhk _ and mir imdfs constrains the time - scale of this settling process in the @xmath3 disk to about @xmath24myr ( section  8.1.2 ) ( table  4 ) .",
    "the low initial value of the _ jhk _ imdf ( @xmath250% ) might also be naturally explained with the effective settling in the inner disk .",
    "future mir spectroscopy of the silicate emission lines and the sed slope @xcite of those i m stars with and without the @xmath3 disk will test the idea that the disappearance of the @xmath3 disk is due to dust settling / growth .",
    "two remarkable trends are known for the jupiter - mass planets around i m stars : ( 1 ) the lack of close - in planets with semimajor axes of @xmath260.5au orbiting stars with masses @xmath133@xmath1 ( such planets are common for stars with @xmath134@xmath1 ) , and ( 2 ) the higher probability of having planets with semimajor axes of @xmath102.5au compared to low - mass stars . in this section ,",
    "we discuss these trends in the context of our disk fraction lifetime results .",
    "there appears to be a lack of close - in planets with semimajor axes of @xmath260.5au orbiting stars with masses of 1.53@xmath1 in planet - search surveys , while close - in planets are more frequent for lower - mass stars @xcite . because planets are thought to form in situ or migrate inward in the formation phase ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our suggestion of rapid planet formation in the @xmath3 disk appears to be inconsistent with the paucity of close - in planets .",
    "however , considering the possible radial range of ` @xmath3 disk ' ( from @xmath20.3au to 1au , depending on the mass of the central star , disk mass , etc . ) , the higher planet occurrence for higher - mass stars @xcite may reflect the rapid planet formation at @xmath135au .",
    "the planets that formed at @xmath136au may have dropped into the central stars due to migration @xcite because the gas disk traced by h@xmath18 still remains for about 2myr after the disappearance of the @xmath3 disk . or",
    ", they may have disappeared due to collisional destruction that may have effectively occurred along with grain growth @xcite . in any case",
    "more studies are necessary to understand the precise relation between disk lifetime and planet formation .    regarding the lack of close - in planets for i m stars ,",
    "two major scenarios have been proposed .",
    "the first scenario is planet engulfment caused by the stellar evolution of primary stars in the rgb phase @xcite .",
    "another scenario is that the observed differences in orbital distribution are primordial , and they are a consequence of the planet - formation mechanism around the more - massive stars @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the latter scenario because our results are relevant to the early stages of star formation .",
    "@xcite suggests that planets around i m stars can not migrate to inner orbits because of the shorter gas - disk lifetime for i m stars .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggest that the inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disk , where the dead zone is the region of the disk without magnetorotational instability @xcite , effectively determines the semimajor axes of giant planets because the dead zone traps inwardly migrating solid bodies .",
    "thus , they suggested that the larger radius of the inner edge for higher mass stars explains the lack of close - in planets .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with currie s scenario in that shorter disk lifetimes are expected for higher - mass stars .",
    "we estimated that the stellar mass dependence of gas disk lifetime @xmath137 is about @xmath82 ( @xmath138myr and @xmath139myr in fig .",
    "however , this dependence is not as steep as assumed in @xcite , @xmath140 with @xmath1411.5 . in any case ,",
    "migration alone may not be able to explain the observed sharp outward step in giant planet orbits as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "our results that the innermost disks of i m stars disappear at a very early time also seem to be consistent with kretke s dead zone model .",
    "@xcite assumed a smooth stellar mass dependence of the inner edge radius of the dead zone ( proportional to @xmath4 ) from the theoretical relationship between the radius and the mass accretion , and they compared this to the mass accretion rate derived from observations .",
    "our results , showing the early disappearance of the innermost @xmath3 disk , suggest that the radius becomes even larger because of low opacity , which makes the formation of dead zone difficult . if the critical stellar mass where the time lag between the @xmath3 disk and the mir disk disk dispersal is observationally determined , then this dead zone idea may be able to explain the lack of close - in planets even for the sharp cut - off at 0.5 au in the planet semimajor axes in the distribution of jupiter - mass planets .",
    "in addition , the difference in the planet formation site in disks of i m stars and lm stars may explain the lack of close - in planets for the i m stars .",
    "planets are thought to form outward of the snow line , @xmath23au for lm stars and @xmath210au for i m stars @xcite .",
    "this difference might explain the observed difference in planet location even after the smearing out by the migration processes , although this idea does not explain the sharp step in planet semimajor axes .",
    "the probability of i m stars having jupiter - mass planets is found to be proportional to @xmath142 for semimajor axes @xmath102.5@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this observed frequency is likely to be determined by two competing effects : the tendency of shorter disk lifetimes for more massive stars reduces the likelihood of giant planets forming @xcite , and the tendency of higher disk masses for more massive stars increases the probability of gas - giant planet formation @xcite . in @xcite , the stellar mass dependence of disk lifetime is estimated using the h@xmath18 disk and mir disk fractions as @xmath143 , where @xmath68 is the disk decay time - scale defined by their model . however , from our results , the disk lifetime at @xmath144 for i m and lm stars is not significantly different , and the stellar mass dependence of disk lifetime ( @xmath145 ) is as small as @xmath146 . the disk mass is known from submm observations to be roughly proportional to the stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass dependence of the disk lifetime is negative , while the stellar mass dependence of the disk mass is positive .",
    "therefore , the higher probability of i m stars having planets compared to lm stars seems to be due to the difference in disk mass instead of the difference in disk lifetime .",
    "we derived and compiled protoplanetary disk fractions of intermediate - mass stars ( 1.57@xmath1 ) for a large number of nearby young clusters ( within @xmath147kpc and @xmath265myr old ) with the available _ jhk _ photometric data in the literature . from the results and by comparing them with those for other wavelengths ( h@xmath18 , mir , and submm ) , we found the following results :    * the @xmath3-disk lifetime of i m stars ( @xmath148 ) , which is defined as the time - scale of disk fraction to bottom out at 5per cent , is estimated to be 3.3@xmath700.9myr .",
    "* the @xmath3-disk lifetime for the i m stars , @xmath148 , is about one - third of that for the lm stars . assuming a power - law dependence , the stellar mass dependence of the @xmath3-disk lifetime is found to be proportional to @xmath149 .",
    "* by comparing the @xmath3 disk ( @xmath150au ) evolution to that of the mir disk ( @xmath132au ) for i m stars , we find that the @xmath3 disk seems to disperse earlier than the mir disk by @xmath234myr . because the @xmath3 disk and the mir disk disperse almost simultaneously in lm stars ( @xmath86myr ) , the long time lag may be a characteristic of i m stars , suggesting that the transition disk is the common phase in i m stars . * because the disk time - scale at @xmath151 for the i m stars does not seem to be significantly different from that of lm stars , the most likely cause for the time lag seems to be early dust growth / settling and/or jupiter - mass planet formation in the innermost disk ( @xmath3 disk ) in i m stars . *",
    "our results for the @xmath3 disk of the i m stars suggest the possible reasons for the paucity of close - in planets around i m stars , but they are not conclusive .",
    "our results also suggest that the disk mass is a more important factor for the stellar mass dependence of planet occurrence than the disk lifetime ."
