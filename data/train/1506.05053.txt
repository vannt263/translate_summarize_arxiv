    "<S> we have also quantified the effect of changing the parameters of the grtd . reducing the barrier width ( a modest change to the structure of existing devices ) increases the tunnel current , and thus raises the oscillation frequency by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> adjustment of the doping of the electrodes can also be used to tune and enhance the oscillation frequency . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have considered the effect of misalignment of the graphene electrodes : in devices with aligned lattices , frequencies approaching 1 thz may be attainable . </S>",
    "<S> gaasinas / alas rtds @xcite with two layer - thick barriers have similar peak currents and voltages as the grtd reported here . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore expect that the grtd will produce similar em emission power ( @xmath14410 @xmath0w ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate the potential of graphene tunnel structures for making the hf components in graphene electronics . </S>"
