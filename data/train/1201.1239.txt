    "the study of the properties of the strongly interacting matter is experimentally supported by the heavy - ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies , accomplished in the most sophisticated accelerators such as the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the measurements coming from these experiments are indirectly used to furnish the basic information on the phase diagram concerning the state of matter , being the different regions related to the distinct hadronic ( confined quarks ) , and the plasma ( free quarks ) phases . in order to cover the plane of the hadron - quark phase diagram",
    ", the new experiments should be able to compress the baryonic matter even to higher densities compared to the well known nuclear saturation density , @xmath1 @xmath2",
    ". the new facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) @xcite at darmstadt , and the nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) @xcite at the joint institute for nuclear research ( jinr ) in dubna , will make possible such extreme conditions through collisions foreseen to reach an energy range of @xmath3 to @xmath4 @xmath5 gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , it will be possible to test the predictions from the theoretical calculations about the order of hadron - quark phase transition ( crossover , first order or both ) , and also the regime of high density and moderate temperatures .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the strongly interacting matter is described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in its nonperturbative regime of large distances , or equivalently low energies , the most important method to study",
    "the qcd structure is the numerical lattice calculations @xcite , with the monte carlo simulations @xcite being its mainly representative .",
    "such techniques provide results as for the pure gluon sector , i.e. , in the limit of infinitely heavy quarks , as for systems including dynamical quarks .",
    "the difficulties in the latter are in the fact that at finite quark chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) regime , the numerical calculations face to the fermion sign problem @xcite .",
    "however , alternatives to solve this question are addressed in many methods @xcite . on the other hand , one can deal with the high energy qcd regime ( asymptotically free region ) @xcite in a complete theoretical way through the perturbative treatment .    to investigate the moderate and high density regime of the transition",
    ", it is needed effective models such as the mit bag model @xcite and the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite one , that curiously were firstly proposed to describe the hadronic mass spectrum .",
    "the former treats gluons and massless quarks as free particles in which the confinement phenomenon is incorporated by including a bag constant in an _ ad hoc _ fashion .",
    "the latter presents further similarities with the full qcd theory but do not take into account the confinement , since the quarks interact each other via pointlike interactions with no mediator gluons .",
    "one of the mainly aims of these kind of models is to provide the qcd phase diagram in the @xmath7 plane in order to distinguish hadronic phase where the chiral symmetry is broken , and the quark one .",
    "the quark stars description with these effective models is in the same important way @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the hadron - quark phase transition is often studied with the mentioned effective qcd models @xcite and other .",
    "recently , a study about the qcd phase diagram was accomplished in ref .",
    "@xcite where the linear @xmath8 model was used to construct the phase transition curve , in the two - flavor quark system , as a function of the vacuum pion mass .",
    "it was shown that the point in the @xmath7 plane where is changed the phase transition order , the critical end point , is sensitive to this parameter . in such cases , where there is only one model ( the quark one )",
    ", the identified phases in the transition curve are associated to those with broken and restored chiral symmetry .    to distinguish hadron and quark phases we have the following well accepted phenomenology .",
    "the strongly interacting matter at very high temperatures and baryon densities should have quarks and gluons as the degrees of freedom .",
    "motivated qcd models , cited above @xcite take these degrees of freedom into account",
    ". on the other side , at low temperatures ( @xmath9  mev ) and moderate densities of the order of @xmath10 , the hadronic phase can not be described by quarks and gluons .",
    "instead , nucleons and mesons are the relevant degrees of freedom . here , different approaches as brueckner - hartree - fock by using realistic two - nucleon interactions @xcite , or relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) models may describe quite well the nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties . between these two phases",
    "a mixed region takes place .    in this work",
    ", we focus in two structurally distinct models to treat the hadron - quark phase transition , namely , the polyakov nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) models in the characterization of the quark phase , and the relativistic mean - field nonlinear walecka ones in the description of the phase where the chiral symmetry is broken , i.e. , the hadronic phase .",
    "the former is a generalization of the njl model in the sense that the confinement phenomenon is incorporated in its structure . for sake of comparison",
    ", we also perform a hadron - quark phase transition using the mit bag model in the quark side , in order to see explicitly the effect of the dynamical confinement contained in the pnjl model compared with the mit bag one .",
    "the motivation for such an approach matching two models with different degrees of freedom is the following .",
    "mit bag and pnjl models do not describe any of the very well known properties of the ordinary nuclear matter while attempting only to achieve , through phase diagrams , the boundaries where this matter starts to be confined . in this aspect only with such models",
    "a more complete description is poor . on the other side ,",
    "the rmf models constructed to well describe the bulk nuclear matter and finite nuclei properties , are often applied to investigate high density regimes as it is common for neutron stars . whether in such regions the rmf models are still valid",
    "is questionable .",
    "the phase transition between the quark and the hadron phase helps understanding when one needs to start describing nuclear matter with other degrees of freedom than baryons and mesons employed by rmf models .",
    "therefore , our study brings more information for the mixed phase between these two still disconnected quark and hadronic phases .",
    "the use of different pnjl and rmf models is needed if one wants to have a more precise conclusion about how the different families of hadronic and quark models predict mixed phases .",
    "if they are similar or not , or still whether the description of the confined / deconfined phase transition only via the pnjl model itself is totally trustable when compared with the approach matching the two models . as we will show , this phase transition obtained by only the pnjl model , is expected to occur in a much smaller chemical potential for the same temperature differing strongly of the transition obtained by models .",
    "future experiments , discussed already before , will show what description is correct .",
    "after the first version of this manuscript was submitted , we became aware of a very similar study in which the hadron - quark phase transition was investigated only with one parametrization for the pnjl and rmf model @xcite .",
    "our systematic study here goes beyond that work , in the following aspects .",
    "our calculations will take into account here different parametrizations for both , the pnjl and rmf models . in the latter",
    ", we will analyze a class of hard and soft equations of state , in a very large range of the nuclear matter incompressibility , @xmath11 mev , and show that , actually , the rmf models affect quite small the entire hadron - quark phase transition . in the former ,",
    "the most up to date polyakov potential parametrizations will be used and compared each other . still , a comparative study involving the hadron - quark phase transition with the mit bag model will be performed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the quark models used in this work , starting by the mit bag model and later with the pnjl one , where a comparison between the current parametrizations , regarding their thermodynamics , is also done . in sec .",
    "iii , the mainly features of the rmf models are presented , and in sec .",
    "iv , the phase diagrams concerning the phase transitions are shown .",
    "our summary and conclusions are in the last section .",
    "possibly , the simplest model to describe an approximate physics describing the matter where quark and gluons are the proper degrees of freedom of the system is the mit bag model @xcite .",
    "such a scenario is supposed to exist at very high density or temperature regimes . back in the big bang theory ,",
    "at the very beginning , the universe was very hot and dense before hadronization . nowadays",
    ", very high energy heavy - ion collision experiments in lhc try to recreate the signatures to confirm this hypothesis . in the case",
    "it is confirmed , hot hadronic matter undergoes a phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) at uncertain but very high and very low temperature and density , respectively . the phase diagram connecting",
    "the qgp phase to a pure hadronic phase from high to zero temperature is still a big challenge and has a model dependence exhibited in previous studies when some relativistic hadronic models and the mit bag ones were investigated @xcite .",
    "the mit bag model itself does not describe the confined hadronic phase but rather the qgp .",
    "therefore , the hadronic phase has to be represented by any hadronic model in which the degree of freedom are baryons and mesons as we will present later on .",
    "once each phase is modeled , the phase diagram is obtained thermodynamically by the gibbs criteria , matching the chemical potential and the pressure at a given temperature ( @xmath12 ) , across the phase boundaries when a phase transition takes place .",

    "the region in between @xmath17 and @xmath18 corresponds to a mixed ( h - qgp ) coexistence phase . above the @xmath18 curve ,",

    ", it can be viewed as a closed path connecting the same point in the space , at the different times @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the traced polyakov loop , with @xmath31 being the quark color number , plays an important role concerning the deconfinement since it is the order parameter of this transition . actually , the deconfinement is a consequence of the global center symmetry breaking . in pure gauge systems at finite temperature , where the periodic boundary conditions are satisfied , this symmetry is realized by the gauge transformations due to the way how they affect the boson fields .",
    "the consequence in the traced polyakov loop is that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 what means that the condition @xmath34 has to be fulfilled in order to keep the center symmetry preserved . since @xmath35 is related with free energy of a color source , through @xmath36 , if the center symmetry is realized , then , meaning that the quark is confined . in dynamical quark systems where the fermionic field explicitly breaks the center symmetry , generating automatically , the traced polyakov loop is considered as an approximated deconfinement order parameter",
    "the situation is analog to the cases in which the system lagrangian density presents a mass term that explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry .",
    "the condensate @xmath37 is also an approximated order parameter , in this case for the restored chiral symmetry phase .",
    "the confinement effect , associated with @xmath35 , was implemented originally in the njl model by fukushima @xcite and deeply studied in refs .",
