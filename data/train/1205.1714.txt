    "this very elegant idea was later intensively studied by many authors  @xcite and extended to all the known interactions , in order to prove that such a theory with the gravitational fields only  that is with vielbeins and spin connections  can manifest in the low energy region the so far observed particles and interactions .",
    "after e. witten  @xcite in his `` no - go theorem '' explained that the break of symmetries from @xmath7 to @xmath6 a compact space causes that massless particles gain the mass of the scale of the break and ca nt therefore lead to the observed properties of particles and fields , the idea in its the most elegant version was almost abandoned .",

    "although we did just assume the two fields used ( not showed how they are generated , say , due to the presence of some spinor fields in interaction with some vielbeins and spin connections not mentioned in the paper ) yet we succeeded to find the analytical solutions for a massless spinor for the whole allowed interval of the parameter of the ( chosen ) spin connection field and the spectrum for massive solutions for a particular choice of the parameter .",
    "in this paper we present the masses and states for spinors living on @xmath3 an almost @xmath1 sphere on which the parameter of the chosen spin connection field is allowed to change in the interval , which assures normalisable solutions .",

    "[ l02 - 20bxeps ] ]    let us conclude the paper by repeating briefly what we have succeeded to do .",
    "we prove that the normalisable solutions of equations of motion  ( [ weyle ] ) can be found for an interval @xmath150 of the parameter @xmath259 , if a spinor lives on a manifold @xmath14 , which breaks into @xmath3 an infinite disc , with the zweibein of  ( [ f ] ) curving the disc into an almost @xmath1 and with the spin connection field  ( [ omegas ] ) which allows on such a disc a massless spinor of only one handedness .",
    "the solutions were found by using the ansatz  ( [ ananzatzl0 ] ) , with the expansion over the associate legendre polynomials , which offer normalisable solutions only for a finite sum , that is up to @xmath162 , @xmath260 .",
    "for each @xmath261 and each chosen value of @xmath150 a discrete mass spectrum ( @xmath262 ) follows , determined by @xmath263 .",
    "there is the gap between the massless and massive states as long as the zweibein and the spin connection remain unchanged .",
    "correspondingly , because of the gap , the massless state can not go continuously into the massive ones for any @xmath264 .",
    "high enough temperatures in comparison with @xmath265 can , however , since the space is non compact , cause the change of the fields on the infinite disc and correspondingly also of the spectrum . but",
    "as long as the temperature is low , we take it zero in this paper , the massless spinor is ( on the tree level ) mass protected and also chirally coupled to the corresponding kaluza - klein gauge field .    the proof presented in this paper is a step to the proof that one can escape from the `` no - go theorem '' of witten  @xcite , that is that one can guarantee the masslessness of spinors and their chiral coupling to the kaluza - klein[like ] gauge fields when breaking the symmetry from the @xmath266-dimensional one to @xmath267 space .",
    "the presented way of searching for solutions of the coupled equations  ( [ maineps ] ) of the first order , leading to the differential equations of the second order  ( [ mainseca ] , [ mainsecb ] ) , is by itself a nice presentation of how can one find normalisable solutions of quite complicated differential equations of the second order .",

    "the technique  @xcite can be used to construct a spinor basis for any dimension @xmath266 and any signature in an easy and transparent way .",
