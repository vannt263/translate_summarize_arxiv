    "on the other hand , it is in principle feasible to control the molecule - surface coupling strength by modifying the chemical binding of the molecule to the surface , as was shown in ref .",

    "we conclude that far away from the active region around the fermi energy , neither the pure spin - flip term proportional to @xmath269 nor the phonon - assisted tunneling terms , i.e. , the last two terms in the hamiltonian  , modify the scaling behavior of the kondo - type coupling of the dot spin to the leads .",
