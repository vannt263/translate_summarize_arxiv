    "we will present a variational ansatz for the ground state of liquid ^4^he  which is build upon the jastrow wavefunction but goes beyond the general functional form of eq .  ( [ eq : feenbergform ] ) .",
    "this ansatz allows to explicitly control the mid - range structure of the liquid and results in a stark improvement of the atomic pair distribution already with a three - parameter wavefunction .",

    "our proposed wavefunction consists of a product of the jastrow function ( limiting eq .",

    "the wavefunction has the following form , @xmath8 the factors @xmath9 must vanish at large distances . at short distances , @xmath10 is expected to raise to a constant .",
    "the effect of the coordination term in ( [ eq : coordinatedwavefunction ] ) can be seen by inspection .",

    "in this case , @xmath12 will have significant value only for the pairs of immediate neighbors @xmath13 . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of neighbors for each atom is limited by the presence of the repulsive core and by the jastrow part of the wavefunction .",
    "thus the overall number of non - vanishing terms @xmath12 in the system is , roughly speaking , fixed .",
    "under such a restraint , the product of sums in the coordination part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coordinatedwavefunction ] ) is maximized when all sums are equal to each other .",
    "that is , _ the non - vanishing values of @xmath12 are distributed equally between the products_. the wavefunction @xmath14 , while constructed only of pairwise functions , has a `` global '' property in that it explicitly demands that each atom in the system has an equal expected number of immediate neighbors .",
    "as we will see , this allows to improve the mid - range properties of the system independently of the jastrow factor .",
    "the inspiration for the coordinated wavefunction @xmath14 comes from the symmetrized bose - solid wavefunction proposed by cazorla et al .",

    "the translational symmetry is not broken and there are no preferred positions ; instead , the atoms in ( [ eq : coordinatedwavefunction ] ) are `` localized '' around their neighbors . as the overlap of atomic cores",

    "suppose all particles are divided into two groups , or clusters , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "let the corresponding number of particles be @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the distance between these clusters is sufficiently large such that the function @xmath10 vanishes for any pair of particles from across the two groups , @xmath20 in this case , the coordination sum for any particle in a subgroup reduces to the sum on that subgroup only , and the coordination term separates , @xmath21 thus a wavefunction for the two clusters reduces to the product of the wavefunctions for the individual clusters .",
    "the evaluation of the coordinated wavefunction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : coordinatedwavefunction ] ) requires the computation of @xmath22 interparticle distances , and the overall computational cost also scales as the second order in the number of particles .",

    "such a wavefunction serves well as a trial wavefunction for a projector monte carlo calculation , yet variationally , kinetic per - particle energy of a system with @xmath82 for large @xmath11 is divergent with the increasing number of particles @xmath1 as @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the bulk density .",

    ", one will notice that the coordination sum - factors in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coordinatedwavefunction ] ) in fact vanish in the limit of low - density , uniformly distributed gas .",
    "thus the coordination term requires that atoms form clusters , so far as function @xmath9 falls off sufficiently rapidly with distance . the size and number of the clusters",
    "is determined by the variational parameters and particle density .",
    "for instance , a gas of dimers already has non - zero coordination term . increasing the range of @xmath10 ( which in our case translates to increasing @xmath51 or decreasing @xmath50 ) increases the size of the clusters .",
    "the parameters also provide control over the structure of the surface .",
    "we have carried variational calculation with the coordinated wavefunction with 1000 atoms in a simulation box that resulted in particle density @xmath86 .",

    "only small @xmath51 resulted in the unbound states albeit with positive energy .",
    "we also find that the extent of function @xmath10 controls the average cluster size and thus the energy .",
    "variational optimization of @xmath50 and @xmath51 results in a state with a single liquid droplet .    to demonstrate the robustness of the inhomogeneous simulation",
    ", we carried monte carlo sampling of the coordinated wavefunction with parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( i.e. , with @xmath10 having larger extent than for the bulk ) .",
    "the initial coordinates of the 1000 particles were randomly distributed in the simulation box .",
    "the sampling sequence is presented in figure  [ fig : surface - formation ] .",
    "soon after the start , the markov chain arrives at configurations with multiple small clusters .",
    "as the clusters merge , a single droplet is eventually formed .",
    "the center of mass of the system is not fixed , and the droplet continues to sample the entire simulation cell .",
    "the inner structure of the droplets and clusters depend strongly on the two - body function @xmath7",
    ". however , jastrow function with the mcmillan factor underestimates the equilibrium density of the bulk ^4^he . without the fixed density constraint , it is to be expected that the inhomogeneous simulation should result in lower densities of the condensed phase",
    "this was indeed observed .",
    "for example , the droplet shown in figure  [ fig : surface - formation ] has inner density that is less than 70% of the bulk equilibrium helium density .",
    "thus the droplet calculation presented here should be seen as a demonstration of principle .",
    "the details of their structure , which require a more detailed jastrow term , will be the subject of further investigation .",
    "we have considered a wavefunction ansatz for strongly correlated bose system that goes beyond the jastrow - feenberg expansion . originating from a symmetrical solid wavefunction proposed by cazorla et al .",
    "@xcite , it is a bose - liquid wavefunction which explicitly promotes the creation of the coordination shells around atoms .",
    "the function is translationally and exchange symmetric .",
    "it is fully explicit and is computationally hard as @xmath89 , making it well suitable for treatment with quantum monte carlo .    to demonstrate the coordination effect ,",
    "we have studied the wavefunction with the one - parameter mcmillan factor for the jastrow term , and a two - parameter coordination function .",
    "the resulting three - parameter wavefunction was straight - forward to optimize variationally .",
    "the short - range nature of the mcmillan factor allowed to directly observe the effects of the coordination terms on the mid - range structure of the liquid .",
    "indeed , the optimized wavefunction results in superior description of mid - range correlations in the system . comparing with unbiased estimate for the pair distribution function obtained with the diffusion monte carlo , we find that the first correlation peak is reproduced almost exactly . moreover , the structure of the pair distribution function is improved consistently throughout larger distances as well .    as was first demonstrated in ref .",
    ", the first correlation peak can be reproduced rather exactly with the jastrow function .",
    "however , this required eight variational parameters , and already the description of the first minimum was significantly lacking . other approaches to accurately describe the mid - range structure with the jastrow factors alone have also been reported @xcite . in our case",
    ", the addition of the coordination term allows to separate the short- and middle - range correlations , which can be accounted for correspondingly by the jastrow and the coordination terms .    by construction",
    ", the coordinated wavefunction supports a self - bound state .",
    "consequently , the simulation of inhomogeneous systems does not require the addition of one - body terms .",
    "moreover , inhomogenuity and surface formation at low densities result directly from the variational optimization of the bulk wavefunction . since the variational ansatz does not require knowledge of the surface geometry , this also provides a powerful tool for cluster states of matter .",
    "however , we find that a satisfactory description of the inhomogeneous phase of helium requires improvements in the jastrow pair term , which was here limited to the mcmillan form for simplicity .",
    "the separation of the mid - range correlations into the coordination term which was demonstrated here means that the jastrow pair term in the coordinated wavefunction only needs to account for the short - range correlations and possibly for the well - understood long - range correlations arising from zero - point phonons .",
    "this makes it promising that an accurate short - range pair term can be designed in future with a simple parametrization .",

    "<S> we present a variational ansatz for the ground state of a strongly correlated bose system . </S>",
    "<S> this ansatz goes beyond the jastrow - feenberg functional form and explicitly enforces coordination shells in the structure of the wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this ansatz to liquid helium-4 with a simple three - variable parametrization of the pair functions . </S>",
    "<S> the optimized wavefunction is found to give an excellent description of the mid - range correlations in the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate the possibility to use this ansatz to study inhomogeneous systems . the phase separation and free surface emerge naturally in this wavefunction , even though it is constructed of short - range two - body functions and does not contain one - body terms . </S>",
    "<S> because no explicit description of the surface is necessary , this provides a powerful description tool for cluster states . </S>"
