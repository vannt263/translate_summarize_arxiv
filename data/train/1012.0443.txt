    "the origin of ferromagnetism in itinerant electron systems , that is of the existence of a net macroscopic magnetic moment , without any external magnetic field , is an old problem set up already by founding fathers of quantum mechanics .",
    "following almost equally old hints by heisenberg @xcite , it is the fermi statistics and the coulomb interaction between the electrons that are responsible for this phenomenon . in their quest for ferromagnetism in itinerant electron systems ,",
    "mielke and tasaki ( see @xcite and references quoted there ) have analyzed the paradigmatic hubbard models that describe strongly - correlated electron systems . the general hamiltonian of those models reads : @xmath2 where the sums are over all the sites @xmath3 of the underlying lattice , and over projections of the electron spin @xmath4 on some axis .",
    "the operators @xmath5 , @xmath6 , stand for the creation and annihilation operator , respectively , of an electron whose spin projection is @xmath4 , being in a state @xmath7 , belonging to an orthonormal basis of the single - particle state space , that is localized at ( and therefore labeled by ) lattice sites @xmath8 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath9  the matrix elements of a single - particle hamiltonian between states @xmath7 and @xmath10  give the hopping intensities ( if @xmath11 ) and on - site external potentials ( if @xmath12 ) .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath13 is a two - body interaction that represents a strongly screened coulomb repulsion ; @xmath14 . by varying the underlying lattices , the matrices @xmath9 , and the number of electrons , @xmath15",
    ", we obtain different systems of itinerant electrons in tight - binding approximation . from the physical point of view , the hamiltonians ( [ hubbard ] ) describe extremely simplified systems of itinerant electrons .",
    "however , these models are not too simple to be relevant for the question of ferromagnetism ; the crucial property , that is the invariance with respect to rotations in the total - spin space ( @xmath16 invariance in the total - spin space ) , holds true .",
    "apparently , the two `` ingredients '' of ferromagnetism , suggested by heisenberg , are built in these models .",
    "for suitable choices of the underlying lattice , the matrix elements @xmath9 , and the electron number @xmath15 , mielke and tasaki have succeeded in proving @xcite , for the first time , that the ground state is _ ferromagnetic _ , that is the total spin , @xmath17 , is proportional to the electron number @xmath18 , for any @xmath13 . moreover , that ground state is a _ saturated ferromagnet _ ( that is , for given @xmath18 , @xmath17 is maximal ) .",
    "their results were the first ones providing us with some fine insight into the nature of itinerant ferromagnetism , with some sufficient conditions for ferromagnetism .",
    "those results go far beyond the mean - field theory that leads to the qualitative stoner criterium @xcite , a kind of necessary condition for ferromagnetism . in their analysis , besides the fermi statistics and coulomb interactions , another factor played a crucial role  the topology of the underlying lattice . without going into details ,",
    "this topology should enable one to adjust the hopping intensities and external potentials in such a way that the lowest band in the single - particle spectrum is non - dispersive , or briefly _ flat _ , and there exists a basis of the flat - band eigensubspace , which consists of _ localized _ ( i.e with bounded support ) eigenstates with suitable overlap and connectivity properties .",
    "now , it has to be mentioned that the theoretical limit of flat band results in a nonphysical system that can not be realized in any experiment .",
    "this is because such an electron system violates a number of physical principles .",
    "for instance , in a range of number densities , the residual entropy is finite ( see @xcite for examples where it was calculated exactly ) , and there is no fermi surface .",
    "moreover , the density of states of flat - band systems is singular and there is no competition between the kinetic energy and the coulomb interaction energy .",
    "therefore , as far as the physical phenomenon , the itinerant ferromagnetism , is concerned , the described models would amount for not more than toy models , if not the subsequent work of tasaki ( @xcite and references quoted there ) .",
    "tasaki has been able to prove that the flat - band ferromagnetism of specific hubbard models is robust against perturbations that broaden the flat band . at least at some cases , the perturbed flat - band models , the so called _ nearly - flat - band models",
    "_ , have also ferromagnetic ground states but only if the value of the hubbard repulsion @xmath0 is greater than some threshold value . for sufficiently large systems and narrow broadened flat bands that threshold value does not depend on the kind of perturbation and boundary conditions applied to the system , and is , therefore , an intrinsic characteristic of nearly - flat - band electron systems ; in the sequel denoted @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity appears to be the greater the stronger the perturbation is , for perturbations that are not too strong , naturally .",
    "in contrast to flat - band models , the defined nearly - flat - band models can , in principle , be realized in experiments .    the stability proof was a real breakthrough , despite the fact that some numerical evidence and non - rigorous arguments for the stability of ferromagnetism in such models had been earlier obtained @xcite",
    ". the only comparable result , but referring to an unsaturated ferromagnetism ( sometimes referred to as ferrimagnetism ) , was obtained by e. lieb @xcite .",
    "while it is hard to overestimate the importance of the above mentioned results for our understanding of ferromagnetism , one should bear in mind that the described phenomenon is rather fragile , in the sense that it is very sensitive to details of the underlying lattice and matrix @xmath9 . in the space of the parameters of hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) , even general ( not necessarily ferromagnetic ) nearly - flat - band systems are of `` measure zero '' .",
    "there are many theoretical examples of nearly - flat - band systems , yet we do not know of any measurements performed on real nearly - flat - band systems .",
    "there have been a few proposals of experimental realizations of nearly - flat - band systems , as atomic quantum wires @xcite , quantum - dot super - lattices @xcite or organic polymers @xcite .",
    "however , the most promising seems to be a realization as an ultracold gas of atoms in an optical lattice @xcite . due to a very good control of system parameters in the latter case ,",
    "such a realization would open new possibilities of investigating the mechanism of nearly - flat - band ferromagnetism , inaccessible in other experimental realizations and beyond the scope of present - day theoretical methods .",
    "most of the models of nearly - flat - band ferromagnets considered in literature , in particular those studied in this paper , represent insulators or semiconductors @xcite .",
    "some physicists might consider this feature as a drawback of those models .",
    "however , recent investigations show that ferromagnetic insulators or semiconductors are very promising materials for vigorously developing spintronics @xcite .",
    "therefore , the mentioned feature constitutes another good reason to study those nearly - flat - band electron systems that are non - metallic .",
    "from the perspective of experimental realizations of nearly - flat - band ferromagnetic systems , it is important to know not only the _ flat - band conditions _ on @xmath9 , which guarantee that the lowest band is flat , but also to have an estimate of the threshold value of the hubbard repulsion , @xmath1 , for given widths of the broadened flat band , which are related to the strength of a perturbation .",
    "it might happen that , for physically realizable parameters @xmath9 , the corresponding threshold value @xmath1 is beyond a range of accessible values . while the flat - band conditions are known for numerous lattices in @xmath19 dimensions , the estimates of @xmath1 are scarse . to the best of our knowledge , there are just two papers in literature where this question was addressed .",
    "the first one is a rough estimate by tasaki @xcite , based on his theorem , with no attempts to optimize it .",
    "the second one is by ichimura et al @xcite , and amounts to calculating the threshold value of @xmath0 for a few small systems and then extrapolating the results to larger systems .",
    "the problem is ( see the sections that follow ) that a small - system threshold value of @xmath0 , from now on denoted @xmath20 , depends significantly on the perturbation used to broaden the underlying flat band and on boundary conditions applied to the system .",
    "we show that not only the values of @xmath20 , calculated in @xcite , but also their least square extrapolation to infinite systems are much above the value of @xmath1 .    in this paper",
    "we extend a little the method of estimating @xmath1 that is based on tasaki theorem .",
    "we calculate also @xmath20 for small hubbard systems with open and periodic - boundary conditions and find , in particular , that contrary to what is suggested in @xcite it is not the open - boundary condition but the periodic one that is appropriate for the task of estimating @xmath1 .    in order to minimize the computational burden ,",
    "we have performed calculations for two periodic , one dimensional , nearly - flat - band ferromagnetic hubbard models , whose lattice consists of a small number of sublattices .",
    "the first one , known in literature as @xmath21-chain or saw - tooth chain ( two sublattices ) , belongs to the tasaki class of models and a version of this system has been analized by tasaki ( see @xcite and references there ) .",
    "the second one ( three sublattices ) , proposed in @xcite as a model of quantum wires , is off the tasaki class ; we name it the sparse @xmath21-chain .",
    "an attempt at estimating its @xmath1 has been made in @xcite . in both mentioned models ,",
    "the underlying lattice is a kind of a decorated one - dimensional lattice , which is often visualized as a quasi - one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we give some details of the two methods of estimating @xmath1 , used in our paper .",
    "then , in section 3 , we present our results for the @xmath21-chain , and in section 4  the results for the sparse @xmath21-chain .",
    "a resume of our results can be found in section 5 .",
    "finally , in appendix , we provide a few tables with numerical values of some data calculated by us , some of which are depicted in diagrams of sections 3 and 4 .",
    "the tasaki method of estimating @xmath1 is based on his proof that a class of nearly - flat - band hubbard systems has the ground state , which is a saturated ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this method enables one to calculate a value of the hubbard repulsion , denoted here @xmath22 , above which the ground state is a saturated ferromagnet , that is @xmath22 is a rigorous upper bound for @xmath1 of sufficiently large lattices . in this subsection , we consider flat - band hubbard models with the periodic - boundary condition , whose lowest band is flat and is separated from higher bands by a gap .",
    "the hamiltonians of such models we denote by @xmath23 , where zero stands for zero width of the flat band .",
    "it is convenient to choose the zero of the energy scale at the energy of the flat band ; as a result , the hamiltonian @xmath23 becomes positive semi - definite .",
    "in many models , including the two studied in this paper , all the constructions , presented below , are feasible . let the underlying lattice @xmath24 consist of @xmath25 sublattices , denoted @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ,  , and let each sublattice consist of @xmath29 sites ( i.e. @xmath29 is the number of elementary cells ) .",
    "let @xmath30 be the minimal set of lattice translations @xmath31 such that the set of translated sites,@xmath32 , coincides with the sublattice to which @xmath8 belongs .",
    "@xmath30 consists of the multiples , @xmath33 , of the elementary translation , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 stands for the identity .",
    "one can construct a basis of the flat - band eigensubspace that consists of @xmath29 localized , overlapping ( so in general nonorthogonal ) states , with supports @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a bounded and connected subset of the lattice ; the union of these supports coincides with the whole lattice .",
    "we label the states of this basis by the sites of sublattice @xmath26 and denote the creation operator of an electron in a state belonging to the localized basis of the flat - band eigensubspace , with spin projection @xmath4 , by @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "after that , one can construct a basis of the orthogonal complement of the flat - band eigensubspace that consists of @xmath41 localized states , @xmath29 states with supports @xmath42 , labeled by the sites of sublattice @xmath27 , @xmath29 states with supports @xmath43 , labeled by the sites of sublattice @xmath28 , ",
    ", where @xmath44 , @xmath45 ,  , are some bounded and connected subsets of the lattice .",
    "the creation operators of electrons in those states with spin projection @xmath4 are denoted by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ,  , respectively . by means of the defined creation operators and their adjoints ,",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath23 can be written in a manifestly positive semi - definite form : @xmath50 after adjusting the amplitudes of the localized states defining the creation and annihilation operators .    apparently ,",
    "the two states @xmath51 , differing by @xmath4 , belong to the ground - state subspace of the system ( [ fb - hubbard ] ) for @xmath52 .",
    "their total spin is maximal , @xmath53 , and the value of the total - spin projection is for one of them maximal , @xmath54 , and for the other  minimal , @xmath55 . by applying to the state with the maximal total - spin projection the operator @xmath56 ,",
    "up to @xmath57 times , we obtain @xmath58 states with the total spin @xmath59 and the total - spin projection between @xmath17 and @xmath60 .",
    "all the mentioned states are linearly independent , and they constitute a basis of a @xmath61-dimensional subspace of @xmath62-electron state space , that we name the ferromagnetic subspace and denote @xmath63 . the proof that the ground state is a saturated ferromagnet amounts to proving that @xmath63 is the ground - state subspace . mielke and tasaki succeeded in constructing specific examples of hamiltonians @xmath23 ( that is specific lattices and suitable matrices @xmath9 for hamiltonian ( [ hubbard])(see @xcite and references quoted therein ) , such that the subspace @xmath63 is the ground - state subspace for any @xmath13 . in their proof ,",
    "a connectivity of the underlying lattice and some overlap properties of the supports of the flat - band eigenstates play a key role .",
    "there are many ways of perturbing flat - band systems , whose ground state is a saturated ferromagnet for any @xmath13 , to get a nearly - flat - band system , whose ground state is a saturated ferromagnet only for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "however , in tasaki method a specific perturbation is used @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a nearly - flat - band system,@xmath64 , obtained by perturbing in tasaki way the considered above flat - band system with hamiltonian @xmath23 , reads : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a parameter measuring the strength of the tasaki perturbation that broadens the flat band ; in the models studied in the sequel @xmath67 will be related to the width of the broadened flat band .",
    "the advantage of the tasaki perturbation , with respect to other ones , is that the ferromagnetic ground - state subspace of the flat - band case ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath63 , is an exact eigensubspace of @xmath64 , for any @xmath67 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue  the ferromagnet s energy  amounts to @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is given by the anticommutation relation , @xmath71 , for @xmath72 .",
    "remarkably , the energy @xmath73 is the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath64 and @xmath63 is the ground - state subspace , provided that @xmath67 is small enough and @xmath0 is large enough .",
    "this statement has been proved by tasaki @xcite for models that belong to the , defined by him , class ( nowadays named the tasaki class ) of hubbard models .",
    "below , we outline the proof and simultaneously present the tasaki method of estimating @xmath1 .",
    "choose a bounded and connected subset , @xmath74 , of the underlying lattice that contains @xmath75 supports of the flat - band localized eigenstates : @xmath38 , @xmath76,@xmath77 , @xmath78 ; these supports are labeled by sites in a subset @xmath79 of sublattice @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , we require that @xmath74 contains all the supports @xmath80 , @xmath81 ,  , that have non - void intersection with the union of the supports @xmath82 .",
    "these supports are labeled by the sites in a subset @xmath83 of @xmath27 , a subset @xmath84 of @xmath28 ,  , respectively .",
    "define an operator @xmath85  the so called potential , whose support is @xmath74 , such that @xmath86 .",
    "it has the following form : @xmath87   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber + \\sum_{i \\in { \\cal{c}}_{{\\cal{s}},\\gamma},\\sigma } \\left [ c(m_{\\alpha } ) c^{\\dagger}_{i,\\sigma } c_{i,\\sigma } + \\frac{1}{2 } u c_{u}(m_{\\alpha } )   n_{i,\\sigma } n_{i,-\\sigma}\\right ]   + \\ldots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the model - dependent coefficients @xmath88 , @xmath89 ,  , are unique .",
    "on the other hand there are numerous choices of coefficients @xmath90 , @xmath91 ,  .",
    "one can fix the latter coefficients by requiring that there is a hubbard repulsion term at each site of @xmath74 .",
    "we adopt this convention in our calculations carried out for specific models .",
    "the potential @xmath85 , expressed in terms of operators @xmath92 , @xmath6 , reads : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , are suitable natural numbers .",
    "we note that @xmath63 is an eigensubspace of @xmath85 to the eigenvalue @xmath97 .",
    "suppose that for some value of the perturbation , @xmath98 , and the hubbard repulsion , @xmath99 , the following conditions are fulfilled : + ( i ) @xmath100 is the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath85 ; let @xmath101 be the corresponding eigensubspace , + ( ii ) any state @xmath102 , with @xmath15 electrons , is of the form @xmath103 for some states @xmath104 with @xmath105 electrons ; this condition implies that @xmath106 for any site @xmath107 , where @xmath108 are some states with @xmath109 electrons , + ( iii ) @xmath110 , for every site @xmath111 and any @xmath102 . + then",
    ", @xmath63 is the ground - state subspace of @xmath112 for the specified value @xmath99 of the hubbard repulsion .",
    "it is worth to note here that this statement holds true as well for any @xmath113 , since for such values of @xmath0 , the @xmath0-independent subspace @xmath101 continues to be the ground - state subspace of @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , @xmath99 is a rigorous upper bound for the threshold value of @xmath0 for any system whose lattice @xmath24 contains @xmath74 , in particular for a macroscopic ( or infinite ) system .    if a sequence of upper bounds @xmath22 , obtained for a sequence of potentials whose support increases indefinitely , is convergent , then its limit coincides with @xmath1 of a macroscopic system . the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) have been proved to hold true , using analytic arguments , in the case of tasaki class of models @xcite , for a specific potential ; this was achieved in an asymptotic region of parameters ( where , in particular , @xmath114 is sufficiently large ) .",
    "we note that it is enough to investigate the potential @xmath85 in the fock space corresponding to the system whose support is @xmath74 , and then @xmath85 can be represented by a finite matrix",
    ". if the support @xmath74 is small enough , then a numerical exact diagonalization procedure is feasible , and the above conditions can be verified numerically . by carrying out such a procedure for a given value of perturbation , @xmath98 , and a decreasing sequence of values of @xmath99 , an optimal estimate of @xmath22 can be determined .",
    "eventually , one ends up with a computer assisted proof of ferromagnetism for given @xmath98 and any @xmath115 .",
    "we follow the route , outlined above , i.e. calculate possibly good estimate of @xmath22 for a sequence of potentials @xmath85 with increasing supports , first in section 3 , where a model from the tasaki class ( @xmath21-chain ) is studied , and then in section 4 , where a model off the tasaki class ( sparse @xmath21-chain ) is considered . in particular , in the latter case the carried out calculations amount to a computer assisted proof that the ground state of a nearly - flat - band sparse @xmath21-chain is a saturated ferromagnet .    actually , the matrices that appear in our calculations are huge and sparse ; their size reaches the order @xmath116 .",
    "to diagonalize such matrices we used the c library _ primme _ of andreas stathopoulos and james r. mccombs @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "a straightforward way of estimating @xmath1 is to calculate it for systems on small lattices , whose number of sites , @xmath117 constitute an increasing sequence , terminating usually at the highest level for which a numerical exact - diagonalization procedure of the underlying hamiltonian is feasible for our computer facilities .",
    "we specify a small piece of the underlying lattice , the parameters of hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) , a boundary condition and the electron number @xmath18 , and carry out an exact numerical diagonalization .",
    "the latter procedure provides us , in particular , with the lowest eigenvalue and a basis of its eigensubspace . in order to qualify the ground - state subspace of our small system as a saturated ferromagnet",

    "@xmath20 depends on @xmath117 , a kind of perturbation and boundary conditions used .",
    "finally , having a sequence of the values of @xmath20 , obtained for systems of different size , we try to guess how @xmath20 scales with @xmath117 , in order to predict the corresponding value , @xmath1 , for a macroscopic system .",
    "we end up this subsection with a comment on the choice of the electron number @xmath18 in small - system calculations .",
    "most of the proofs of flat - band ferromagnetism and the tasaki proof of nearly - flat - band ferromagnetism can be carried out only for particular @xmath18 , such that exactly half of a band in the single - particle spectrum can be filled .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions such a @xmath18 amounts to @xmath122 .",
    "however , for open boundary condition this definition looses its meaning , since the bands are not well defined and , moreover , @xmath123 might not be divisible by @xmath25 . in the latter case ,",
    "we choose one of the two integers that are the closest to @xmath122 .",
    "as will be demonstrated in sections 3 and 4 , the results of calculations depend significantly on @xmath117 , whether it is divisible by @xmath25 , and on the chosen integer approximation to half - integer @xmath122 .",
    "the first system for which we consider the problem of estimating the threshold value @xmath1 of a macroscopic system is the @xmath21-chain .",

    "a bond between two sites is represented by a continuous line , if the corresponding hopping intensity is nonzero for any @xmath66 , and by a dashed line , if it vanishes in the unperturbed system .",
    "there are three independent hopping intensities .",

    "[ sparse delta chain ] ) .",
    "we shall see below that the flat - band is the lowest one , if @xmath150 ( @xmath145 can be of any sign ) . in order to make our model the counterpart of that in @xcite",

    "for this particular sparse-@xmath21-chain , the width of the broadened flat band ( tasaki perturbation ) is @xmath154 , which is @xmath155 approximately , and the gap above the broadened flat band is @xmath156 .",

    "one can check easily that if the conditions ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) of the tasaki method are satisfied for these potentials , then the tasaki proof of saturated ferromagnetism in the ground - state @xcite can be carried out .    up to now , we have dealt with only one way of perturbing a flat - band system to obtain a nearly - flat - band one , i.e. the tasaki perturbation defined in ( [ nfb - hubbard ] ) .",
    "an alternative way consists in modifying one or more arbitrary chosen hoping intensities and/or external potentials , while keeping the remaining ones intact , so that the flat - band condition is no longer valid .",
    "this is the way adopted by ichimura et al in @xcite to perturb the above defined flat - band sparse @xmath21-chain .    apparently , different perturbations of the same flat - band system result in different nearly - flat - band systems . in order to compare the threshold values of @xmath0 calculated for such a different systems we have to make the systems itself comparable .",

    ", we note that according to good qualitative arguments @xcite the way of perturbing a flat - band system is not relevant for the existence of the phenomenon of nearly - flat - band ferromagnetism ; whatever the perturbation , there is @xmath163 , which increases with the strength of perturbation .",

    "the ichimura et al choice of the hopping parameters results in a nearly - flat - band width of the order @xmath179 of the energy unit .",
    "we have repeated the calculations for another values of hopping parameters that give the nearly - flat - band width of the order @xmath180 . as expected , the calculated values of @xmath20 are smaller , they also seem to scale linearly with @xmath171 , but the slope of the least - square linear fit is smaller than in the previous case , so that the value of a least - square linear extrapolation to @xmath178 limit is higher than in the previous case . in the case of tasaki perturbation",
    "( open boundary condition ) the values of @xmath20 are even higher than in the case of ichimura et al perturbation ( see tab .",
    "[ small sparse delta - chain , tasaki pert . , o.b.c . ] ) .",
    "apparently , the linear scaling , observed in the case of the flat - band sparse @xmath21-chain with ichimura et al perturbation , is accidental , and the predicted value of @xmath1 is not reliable . taking into account our results for the @xmath21-chain , one can claim that small - system and open - boundary condition threshold values of @xmath0 are irrelevant for our task of estimating @xmath1 of nearly - flat - band systems .",
    "definitely , the threshold values of @xmath0 obtained for periodic boundary conditions constitute a better basis for deriving reliable estimates of @xmath1 .",
    "nearly - flat - band ferromagnets constitute a specific class of strongly - correlated electrons systems .",
    "theoretically , they can be thought of as weak perturbations of the underlying unphysical flat - band systems .",
    "one of their characteristic features , which is a result of the competition between the kinetic energy and the coulomb interaction energy , is the threshold value @xmath1 of the screened coulomb repulsion , above which a nearly - flat - band electron system becomes ferromagnetic .",
    "this quantity is well defined for sufficiently large systems , presumably not necessarily as large as macroscopic ones .",
    "it is desirable to have a reasonable estimate of that intrinsic property of nearly - flat - band ferromagnets .    in this paper , we have made attempts at estimating @xmath1 in two nearly - flat - band systems , modeled by hubbard hamiltonians ( [ hubbard ] ) , the nearly - flat - band @xmath21-chain and the nearly - flat - band sparse @xmath21-chain , defined in section 3 and section 4 , respectively .",
    "this choice has been convenient , since it enabled us to avoid large volume computer calculations . concerning the electric conductivity both models can be classified as insulators or semiconductors .",
    "we have considered two methods of estimating @xmath1 , described in detail in section 2 .",
    "one of the methods , the tasaki method , provides us with rigorous upper bounds for true @xmath1 , independent of the size of the system and boundary conditions .",
    "we have shown how to obtain the best bounds , whose quality is limited only by available computer facilities , and obtained those bounds for both models . in the case of the sparse @xmath21-chain , this resulted in a computer assisted proof of nearly - flat - band ferromagnetism ( the existence of flat - band ferromagnetism was demonstrated in @xcite ) .",
    "the other method , studied by us , is the method of small - system estimates of @xmath1 ; this method amounts to what a physicist would typically do when faced with such a problem .",
    "it provides us with boundary condition and perturbation dependent threshold values @xmath20 .",
    "then , the problem we have to deal with is how to extract reliable estimates of @xmath1 , having a set of values of @xmath20 obtained for systems of different sizes , open- or periodic - boundary conditions , and various perturbations , like tasaki or ichimura et al perturbations .",
    "our main conclusion is that when applying the method of small - system estimates one should resort to periodic - boundary .",
    "concerning the perturbation , the tasaki perturbation is preferable .",
    "finally , concerning the question of the range of values taken by @xmath1 , let us note that , in the two models considered , we have chosen one of the hopping intensities as the energy unit .",
    "the remaining independent hopping intensities have been chosen to differ from this unit by not more than a few ten per cent .",
    "then , the widths of the broadened flat - bands do not exceed 14 percent of the energy unit .",
