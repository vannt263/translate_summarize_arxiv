    "a general analytical approach for calculating the beam coupling impedances of small discontinuities on the walls of an accelerator vacuum chamber has been developed in @xcite for ultrarelativistic beams .",
    "the method is based on the bethe theory of diffraction by small holes @xcite , according to which the fields diffracted by a hole can be found as those radiated by effective electric and magnetic dipoles .",
    "the bethe idea of effective dipoles developed in 1944 was first used to calculate the coupling impedances of pumping holes in a circular waveguide for the case of an ultrarelativistic beam in 1992 @xcite .",
    "bethe s theory is applicable for wavelengths large compared to the typical hole size @xmath0 , and it can be used for impedance calculations when @xmath0 is much smaller than the typical dimension @xmath1 of the chamber cross section . within this limitation ,",
    "the theory was applied to vacuum chambers with an arbitrary simply - connected cross section in @xcite , again for relativistic beams .",
    "the imaginary part of the impedance was shown to be proportional to the difference of hole polarizabilities @xmath2 , where the magnetic susceptibility @xmath3 and the electric polarizability @xmath4 are both small compared to @xmath5 . from considerations of the energy radiated into the chamber and through the hole ,",
    "the real part of the hole impedance comes out to be proportional to @xmath6 , being usually much smaller than the reactance .",
    "these results are not restricted to small holes , but remain valid for other small discontinuities like posts , masks , or irises , because the idea of effective polarizabilities works equally well in those cases , as was demonstrated in . a more refined theory that takes into account the reaction of radiated waves back on the hole",
    "was developed in @xcite . in the latter approach ,",
    "the beam coupling impedances of a discontinuity come out as perturbative series in polarizabilities , more exactly , in small parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 : the reactive impedance is the first order effect , while the real part of the impedance has the second order .",

    "therefore , the deflecting force in the circular pipe is directed to ( or opposite to ) the discontinuity , and its magnitude depends on the angle between the hole and the beam transverse displacement , as was pointed out already in the relativistic case @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ imptc ] ) agrees , up to notations , with the result obtained in .    in a general case ,",
    "it is sometimes convenient to rewrite the dipole transverse impedance ( [ impt ] ) as @xmath229 in particular , this form is more convenient for the rectangular chamber .",

    "it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ zt ] ) that the angle @xmath239 shows the direction of the transverse - impedance vector @xmath240 and , therefore , of the beam - deflecting force .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of @xmath241 is maximal when the beam is deflected along this direction and vanishes when the beam offset is perpendicular to it . for a circular pipe , @xmath242 , as was discussed above . for a general cross section ,",
    "this is not the case even in the relativistic limit ; see @xcite for rectangular and elliptic chambers . as an illustration , in fig .  3 we plot the relation between @xmath236 and @xmath228 for a square chamber for a few different values of parameter @xmath243 .",
    "the case @xmath244 corresponds to the relativistic ( or low - frequency ) limit ; as @xmath245 increases , the difference between @xmath236 and @xmath228 becomes smaller .    in fig .  4 , the behavior of @xmath246 in eq .  ( [ zt ] )",
    "is illustrated for a square cross section of the vacuum chamber .",
    "this function is given by eq .",

    "figure  4 demonstrates also the impedance dependence on the position of the discontinuity on the chamber wall : @xmath248 corresponds to the middle of the wall , 0.75 is one quarter from the corner , and 0.9 is close to the corner .",
    "figures 3 - 4 , as well as figs .  1 - 2 , were produced using _ mathematica _ @xcite .",
    "it takes less than ten terms in the series ( [ grenpr ] ) and ( [ enpr0 ] ) to get a very accurate answer for the sum , which is not surprising since the 10th term in ( [ enpr0 ] ) is of the order of @xmath249 .",
    "however , even with hundreds of terms _ mathematica _ gives the results almost as quickly as those involving modified bessel functions for the circular pipe in figs .",
    ".    one should remind that the impedance magnitude decreases even faster with the frequency increase for a fixed @xmath69 than shown in fig .  4 , since @xmath250 .",
    "the full @xmath69-dependence of the transverse impedance includes , of course , the shape factor @xmath251 ; overall , it is similar to that of the longitudinal impedance illustrated in figs .  1 - 2 .",
    "we will show in this section that the same approach as above  based on field expansions in cross - section eigenfunctions  works equally well for calculating the space - charge impedance of a uniform waveguide with an arbitrary simply - connected cross section .",
    "while this subject seems to be somewhat off topic for the present paper , the result comes as a by - product of the considerations in the previous sections .",

    "every term of the series in eq .",
    "( [ zsc ] ) is positive , so that the space - charge impedance always remains a `` negative inductance '' .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the dependence on the beam charge distribution is an essential feature of the space - charge impedance .",
    "for example , one can not use a pencil beam ( point charge ) in ( [ zsc ] ) : the space - charge impedance diverges as the beam transverse size vanishes , e.g.  . on the contrary ,",
    "the geometrical impedances discussed in the previous sections are generally independent of the beam properties , at least in the relativistic limit , and for that reason they are usually calculated in the simplest way , that is with an on - axis pencil beam .",

    "we concentrated mostly on the leading ( imaginary ) part of the impedances created by discontinuities . in a general case",
    ", it was shown that the coupling impedances of small discontinuities depend on the beam velocity in two ways : first , through the combination of polarizabilities @xmath278 , and second , via the parameter @xmath279 that enters into the factors @xmath280 for the longitudinal impedance , see eqs .",

    "the overall impedance dependence on the beam velocity for small discontinuities was discussed in sec .",
    "the most interesting feature is that the impedance magnitude for some @xmath283 can exceed its relativistic value many times , see figs .  1 - 2 .",

    ", one can give then an impedance estimate for a given beam velocity in such a chamber .",
