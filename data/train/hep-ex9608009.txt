    "one of the aims of building hera was to study the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) region with data at low @xmath3 and high @xmath4 . yet , recently efforts are being made to get to lower and lower @xmath4 values in the low @xmath3 region in order to study the transition from photoproduction to the dis regime .",
    "the main motivation for looking at the transition region is the following : at @xmath5 the dominant processes are of non  perturbative nature and are well described by the regge picture . as @xmath4 increases , the exchanged photon is expected to shrink and one expects perturbative qcd to take over .",
    "what can one learn from the transition between soft processes ( low virtuality ) and hard processes ( high virtuality ) ?",
    "where does the change take place ?",
    "is it a sudden transition or a smooth one ?",
    "the transition should shed light on the interplay between soft and hard interactions .",
    "in addition , being able to describe this region has a practical necessity : it is needed for calculating radiative corrections .",
    "the purpose of this talk is to review the ideas in modelling the low @xmath3 and low @xmath4 region  @xcite .",
    "donnachie and landshoff  @xcite found a simple regge picture describing all hadron  hadron cross sections with a sum of two terms , that of a pomeron exchange and that of a reggeon .",
    "they showed this picture to describe also real photoproduction cross sections .",
    "they extended the picture for virtual photons ( @xmath6 10 gev@xmath7 ) to see what is the expected contribution of the non  perturbative mechanism to higher @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the main interest is in the low @xmath3 region where the pomeron dominates and thus the question of interest is what is the contribution of the ` soft ' pomeron at intermediate @xmath4 .      in this picture",
    "@xcite there is no ` soft ' or ` hard ' pomeron , there is just one ` bare ' pomeron . at low @xmath4 absorptive corrections ( rescattering )",
    "give a pomeron with an effective intercept of @xmath8 .",
    "if one uses an eikonal approach , the bare intercept becomes @xmath9 .",
    "a more complete absorptive calculation results in @xmath10 .",
    "the absorptive corrections decrease rapidly with @xmath4 .",
    "they parametrize the data with this behavior of the pomeron up to @xmath11 5 gev@xmath7 and use it then as initial conditions to a pqcd evolution .",
    "badelek and kwiecinski  @xcite describe the low @xmath4 region by using the generalized vector dominance model ( gvdm ) : the proton structure function @xmath12 is represented by the contribution of a large number of vector mesons which couple to virtual photons .",
    "the low mass ones , @xmath13 contribute mainly at low @xmath4 , while the higher mass are determined by the asymptotic structure function @xmath14 which is described by pqcd .",
    "the total structure function is given by a @xmath4 weighted sum of the two components .",
    "this parameterization  @xcite is based on a regge motivated approach extended into the large @xmath4 regime in a way compatible with qcd expectations .",
    "this approach allows to parametrize the whole @xmath15 phase space , fitting all the existing data .",
    "the dl parametrization provides a good way to check to what value of @xmath4 can the simple soft pomeron picture be extended .",
    "it is not meant to be a parameterization which describes the whole dis regime .",
    "the ckmt and bk parametrizations are attempts to get the best possible presentation of the initial conditions to a pqcd evolution .",
    "the allm does not use the regular pqcd evolution equation but parametrizes the whole of the dis phase space by a combination of regge and qcd motivated parametrizations .",
    "all parameterizations make sure that as @xmath16 also @xmath17 linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "the proton structure function @xmath12 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the rescaled variable @xmath20 with @xmath3 being the bjorken@xmath3 and the scale variable @xmath21 has different values for different flavors : for @xmath22 and @xmath23 quarks @xmath24 gev , for the strange quark @xmath25 , @xmath26 gev and for the charm quark @xmath27 , @xmath28 gev .",
    "the two functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 make sure that the structure function vanishes linearly with @xmath4 as @xmath31 0 , @xmath32 the four parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constrained so as to reproduce the total real photoproduction data , @xmath35 in addition there is also a higher  twist term @xmath36 contributing to the structure function , @xmath37 with the parameters @xmath38 = 15.88 and @xmath39 = 550 mev .",
    "contrary to the dl parameterization , the ckmt assumes that the power behavior of @xmath3 is @xmath4 dependent , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the reggeon trajectory intercept , the power @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 and the power behavior of @xmath3 is given by @xmath44 the constant parameters are determined by the requirement that @xmath12 and the derivative @xmath45 at @xmath46 to coincide with that obtained from the pqcd evolution equations .",
    "they can do so at @xmath47 = 2 gev@xmath7 , provided a higher  twist term is added to that of pqcd , @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath50 = 0.1502 , @xmath51 = 0.2631 gev@xmath7 , @xmath52 = 0.07684 , @xmath23 = 1.117 gev@xmath7 , @xmath34 = 0.6452 gev@xmath7 , @xmath41 = 0.415 , @xmath27 = 3.5489 gev@xmath7 .",
    "the proton structure function is written as the sum of two terms , a vector meson part ( v ) and a partonic part ( par ) , @xmath53 the part representing the contribution from vector mesons which couple to the virtual photon is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the direct photon vector meson coupling , @xmath2 is the @xmath1 center of mass energy and @xmath56 is the total @xmath57 cross section .",
    "the sum is over all vector meson satisfying @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the mass of the vector meson and @xmath39 is a parameter .",
    "the partonic part of the structure function is given by the expression @xmath60 where the asymptotic structure function @xmath14 is given by pqcd at the scaled value of @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the proton mass . in practice the parameterization uses @xmath47 = 1.2 gev@xmath7 and thus sums over the contribution of the 3 lightest vector mesons @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this parameterization attempts to cover the whole of @xmath65 region above the resonances ( @xmath66 3 gev@xmath7 ) , at the expense of introducing more parameters than the other parameterizations .",
    "the proton structure function has the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the effective photon mass .",
    "the functions @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the contribution of the pomeron @xmath71 or reggeon @xmath72 exchanges to the structure function .",
    "they take the form @xmath73 the slowly varying function @xmath74 is defined as @xmath75 the two scaled variables @xmath76 and @xmath77 are modified bjorken@xmath3 variables which include mass parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 which can be interpreted as effective pomeron and reggeon masses : @xmath80",
    "the proton structure function has been measured  @xcite in a wide range of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "a constructive way to display them  @xcite over a wide kinematical range is to use the relation between @xmath12 and the total @xmath1 cross section , @xmath81 in this expression the hand definition of the flux of virtual photons is used .",
    "( 100,145)(-70,1 )    figure [ fig : gstarp_allm ] presents the dependence of @xmath82 , obtained through equation [ sigf2 ] from the measured @xmath12 values  @xcite , on the square of the center of mass energy , @xmath83 , for fixed values of the photon virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "the new preliminary very low @xmath4 measurements of the zeus collaboration  @xcite , as well as those of the nmc collaboration presented at this workshop  @xcite are included in the figure . also shown are the measurements of the total real photoproduction cross sections . while the data below @xmath4=1 gev@xmath7 shows a very mild @xmath2 dependence , which resembles that of the real photon data , the trend changes as @xmath4 increases .",
    "note that for higher values of @xmath4 one sees the typical threshold behavior for the case when @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "the curves are the results of a new allm type parameterization which includes now also the data from e665  @xcite , those from nmc  @xcite and the published hera  @xcite data .",
    "( 100,125)(-70,1 )    instead of comparing the data as presented in figure [ fig : gstarp_allm ] with the different parameterizations , it is more economical as well as instructive to study the energy dependence of the @xmath1 cross section for fixed @xmath4 values  @xcite . in order to see how the slope of the @xmath2 dependence changes with @xmath4 , the cross section values in the region where @xmath85 were fitted to the form @xmath86 for each fixed @xmath4 interval .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath87 from the fit are plotted against @xmath4 in figure [ fig : delta ] .",
    "similar results have been obtain by the h1 collaboration  @xcite who use only their own data to fit the structure function measurements to the form @xmath88 . also included in the figure are the recent preliminary results of the zeus collaboration  @xcite in the region @xmath89 gev@xmath7 .",
    "one can see the slow increase of @xmath87 with @xmath4 from the value of 0.08 at @xmath4=0 , to around 0.2 for @xmath90 1020 gev@xmath7 followed by a further increase to around 0.30.4 at high @xmath4 .",
    "one would clearly profit from more precise data , expected to come soon .",
    "the curves are the expectations of the dl , bk , ckmt , and the updated allm parameterization , which includes also some of the recent hera data in its fit .",
    "in addition , the expectations of the grv  @xcite , cteq  @xcite and mrsg  @xcite are also shown .",
    "the dl parameterization can describe the data up to @xmath90 1 gev@xmath7 .",
    "all the others give in general the right features of the @xmath4 behavior with a smooth transition from soft to hard interactions with an interplay between the two in the intermediate @xmath4 range .",
    "what have we learned from the behavior of the data with @xmath4 ?",
    "what are we actually measuring ? at low @xmath4 the photon is known to have structure .",
    "does @xmath12 still measure the structure of the proton ?",
    "bjorken  @xcite pointed out that physics is not frame dependent .",
    "the structure of the proton alone has no meaning .",
    "one has to study the @xmath1 interaction .",
    "let us look at the structure of a photon .",
    "it is a well known fact that real photon behave like hadrons when interacting with other hadrons .",
    "one way to understand this is by using the argument of ioffe  @xcite : the photon can fluctuate into a @xmath91 pair .",
    "the fluctuation time is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the photon energy in the rest system of the proton and @xmath94 is the mass of the @xmath91 system into which the photon fluctuates .",
    "the vector dominance model assumes that the fluctuation of the photon is into vector mesons , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the vector mesom mass . as long as @xmath97 , where the interaction time @xmath98 , with @xmath99 being the proton radius , the photon interacts as if it were a hadron .",
    "when the photon becomes virtual with a negative square mass of @xmath4 , its fluctuation time becomes @xmath100 and thus at low energies and moderate bjorken @xmath3 , the fluctuation time becomes small and the virtual photon behaves like a point  like structureless object , consistent with the dis picture described above .",
    "however , at high energies or equivalently in the low @xmath3 region studied at hera , the fluctuation time of a virtual photon can be expressed as @xmath101 where @xmath62 is the proton mass .",
    "this can be derived easily from formula ( 20 ) , assuming @xmath102  @xcite .",
    "thus in the hera regime , a photon of virtuality as high as @xmath103 gev@xmath7 can fluctuate into a @xmath91 pair , which will survive till arrival on the proton target .",
    "the photon can fluctuate into typically two configurations .",
    "a large size configuration will consist of an asymmetric @xmath91 pair with each quark carrying a small transverse momentum @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ajm](a ) ) . for a small size configuration",
    "the pair is symmetric , each quark having a large @xmath104 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ajm](b ) ) .",
    "one expects the asymmetric large configuration to produce soft physics , while the symmetric one would yield the hard interactions .    in the aligned jet model ( ajm )",
    "@xcite the first configuration dominates while the second one is the sterile combination because of color screening . in the photoproduction case ( @xmath4 = 0 ) , the small @xmath104 configuration dominates .",
    "thus one has large color forces which produce the hadronic component , the vector mesons , which finally lead to hadronic non  perturbative final states of soft nature .",
    "the symmetric configuration contributes very little . in those cases where the photon does fluctuate into a high @xmath104 pair",
    ", color transparency suppresses their contribution .",
    "( 150,40)(-50,90 )    in the dis regime ( @xmath105 0 ) , the symmetric contribution becomes bigger .",
    "each such pair still contributes very little because of color transparency , but the phase space for the symmetric configuration increases .",
    "however the asymmetric pair still contribute also to the dis processes .",
    "in fact , in the quark parton model ( qpm ) the fast quark becomes the current jet and the slow quark interacts with the proton remnant resulting in processes which look in the @xmath1 frame just like the soft processes discussed in the @xmath4 = 0 case .",
    "so there clearly is an interplay between soft and hard interactions also in the dis region .",
    "this now brings up another question .",
    "we are used by now to talk about the resolved and the direct photon interactions . however ,",
    "if the photon always fluctuates into a @xmath106 pair even at quite large values of @xmath4 , what does one mean by a direct photon interaction ? to illustrate the problem , let us look at the diagram describing the photon ",
    "gluon fusion , which is usually considered in leading order a direct photon interaction and is shown in figure [ fig : direct](a ) .",
    "an example of a resolved process is shown in figure [ fig : direct](b ) where a photon fluctuates into a @xmath106 pair with a given @xmath104 , following by the interaction of one of the quarks with a gluon from the proton to produce a quark and a gluon with a given @xmath107 .",
    "( 150,60)(-50,90 )    in the diagram shown in figure [ fig : direct](b ) there are two scales , @xmath104 and @xmath107 .",
    "the classification of the process as direct or resolved depends on the relations between the two scales .",
    "if @xmath108 we call it a resolved photon interaction , while in the case of @xmath109 one would consider this as a direct photon interaction .",
    "practically in the latter case the @xmath107 is too small to resolve the gluon and the quark jets as two separate jets , thus making it look like the diagram in figure [ fig : direct](a ) . at low @xmath4",
    "the more likely case is that of @xmath110 and thus the resolved photon is the dominant component , while at high @xmath4 the other case is more likely .",
    "a yet open question is how does one deal with the case where @xmath111 .",
    "the energy behavior of the @xmath1 cross section shows that there is a smooth transition between the @xmath4 region where there is a mild energy dependence to that where the energy behavior is steeper .",
    "it happens somewhere in the region of about 1 gev@xmath7 .",
    "does this tell us where soft interactions turn into hard ones ? in order to understand the structure of the dynamics , one has to isolate in the transition region the specific configurations in @xmath104 and @xmath107 for a better insight of what is happening .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank halina abramowicz and lonya frankfurt for giving me some better insight of the interplay between soft and hard interactions .",
