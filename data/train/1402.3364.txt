    "large networks are everywhere",
    ". can we understand their structure and exploit it ?",
    "for example , understanding key structural properties of large - scale data networks is crucial for analyzing and optimizing their performance , as well as improving their reliability and security @xcite . in prior empirical and theoretical studies",
    "researchers have mainly focused on features like small world phenomenon , power law degree distribution , navigability , high clustering coefficients , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "those nice features were observed in many real - life complex networks and graphs arising in internet applications , in biological and social sciences , in chemistry and physics .",
    "although those features are interesting and important , as it is noted in @xcite , the impact of intrinsic geometrical and topological features of large - scale data networks on performance , reliability and security is of much greater importance .",
    "recently , a few papers explored a little - studied before geometric characteristic of real - life networks , namely the _ hyperbolicity _",
    "( sometimes called also the _ global curvature _ ) of the network ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that a number of data networks , including internet application networks , web networks , collaboration networks , social networks , and others , have small hyperbolicity .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that property , observed in real - life networks , that traffic between nodes tends to go through a relatively small core of the network , as if the shortest path between them is curved inwards , may be due to global curvature of the network .",
    "furthermore , paper @xcite proposes that  hyperbolicity in conjunction with other local characteristics of networks , such as the degree distribution and clustering coefficients , provide a more complete unifying picture of networks , and helps classify in a parsimonious way what is otherwise a bewildering and complex array of features and characteristics specific to each natural and man - made network \" .",
    "the hyperbolicity of a graph / network can be viewed as a measure of how close a graph is to a tree metrically ; the smaller the hyperbolicity of a graph is the closer it is metrically to a tree .",
    "recent empirical results of @xcite on hyperbolicity suggest that many real - life complex networks and graphs may possess tree - like structures from a metric point of view .    in this paper",
    ", we substantiate this claim through analysis of a collection of real data networks .",
    "we investigate few more , recently introduced graph parameters , namely , the _ tree - distortion _ and the _ tree - stretch _ of a graph , the _ tree - length _ and the _ tree - breadth _ of a graph , the gromov s _ hyperbolicity _ of a graph , the _ cluster - diameter _ and the _ cluster - radius _ in a _ layering partition _ of a graph .",
    "all these parameters are trying to capture and quantify this phenomenon of being metrically close to a tree and can be used to measure metric tree - likeness of a real - life network .",
    "recent advances in theory ( see appropriate sections for details ) allow us to calculate or accurately estimate those parameters for sufficiently large networks . by examining topologies of numerous publicly available networks , we demonstrate existence of metric tree - like structures in wide range of large - scale networks , from communication networks to various forms of social and biological networks .    throughout this paper",
    "we discuss these parameters and recently established relationships between them for unweighted and undirected graphs .",
    "it turns out that all these parameters are at most constant or logarithmic factors apart from each other .",
    "hence , a constant bound on one of them translates in a constant or almost constant bound on another .",
    "we say that a graph _ has a tree - like structure from a metric point of view _",
    "( equivalently , _ is metrically tree - like _ ) if anyone of those parameters is a small constant .",
    "recently , paper @xcite pointed out that `` although large informatics graphs such as social and information networks are often thought of as having hierarchical or tree - like structure , this assumption is rarely tested , and it has proven difficult to exploit this idea in practice ; ... it is not clear whether such structure can be exploited for improved graph mining and machine learning ... '' .    in this paper , by bringing all those parameters together ,",
    "we not only provide efficient means for detecting such metric tree - like structures in large - scale networks but also show how such structures can be used , for example , to efficiently and compactly encode approximate distance and almost shortest path information and to fast and accurately estimate diameters and radii of those networks .",
    "estimating accurately and quickly distances between arbitrary vertices of a graph is a fundamental primitive in many data and graph mining algorithms .",
    "graphs that are metrically tree - like have many algorithmic advantages .",
    "they allow efficient approximate solutions for a number of optimization problems .",
    "for example , they admit a ptas for the traveling salesman problem  @xcite , have an efficient approximate solution for the problem of covering and packing by balls  @xcite , admit additive sparse spanners  @xcite and collective additive tree - spanners  @xcite , enjoy efficient and compact approximate distance  @xcite and routing  @xcite labeling schemes , have efficient algorithms for fast and accurate estimations of diameters and radii  @xcite , etc .. we elaborate more on these results in appropriate sections .    for the first time such metric parameters , as tree - length and tree - breadth , tree - distortion and tree - stretch , cluster - diameter and cluster - radius , were examined , and algorithmic advantages of having those parameters bounded by small constants were discussed for such a wide range of large - scale networks .    this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : notions ] , we give notations and basic notions used in the paper . in section [ sec : datasets ] , we describe our graph datasets .",
    "the next four sections are devoted to analysis of corresponding parameters measuring metric tree - likeness of our graph datasets : layering partition and its cluster - diameter and cluster - radius in section [ sec : layer - partit ] ; hyperbolicity in section",
    "[ sec : hyperbol ] ; tree - distortion in section [ sec : td ] ; tree - breadth , tree - length and tree - stretch in section [ sec : tb ] . in each section",
    "we first give theoretical background on the parameter(s ) and then present our experimental results .",
    "additionally , an overview of implications of those results is provided . in section [ appl ] , we further discuss algorithmic advantages for a graph to be metrically tree - like .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : concl ] , we give some concluding remarks .",
    "all graphs in this paper are connected , finite , unweighted , undirected , loopless and without multiple edges . for a graph @xmath0 , we use @xmath1 and @xmath2 interchangeably to denote the number of vertices in @xmath3 . also , we use @xmath4 and @xmath5 to denote the number of edges . the _ length of a path _ from a vertex @xmath6 to a vertex @xmath7 is the number of edges in the path .",
    "the _ distance _ @xmath8 between vertices @xmath7 and @xmath6 is the length of the shortest path connecting @xmath7 and @xmath6 in @xmath3 .",
    "the _ ball _ @xmath9 of a graph @xmath3 centered at vertex @xmath10 and with radius @xmath11 is the set of all vertices with distance no more than @xmath11 from @xmath12 ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) .",
    "we omit the graph name @xmath3 as in @xmath14 if the context is about only one graph .",
    "the _ diameter _ @xmath15 of a graph @xmath0 is the largest distance between a pair of vertices in @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "eccentricity _ of a vertex @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath17 , is the largest distance from that vertex @xmath6 to any other vertex , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the _ radius _ @xmath19 of a graph @xmath0 is the minimum eccentricity of a vertex in @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "the _ center",
    "_ @xmath21 of a graph @xmath0 is the set of vertices with minimum eccentricity .",
    "definitions of graph parameters measuring metric tree - likeness of a graph , as well as notions and notations local to a section , are given in appropriate sections .",
    "our datasets come from different domains like internet measurements , biological datasets , web graphs , social and collaboration networks .",
    "table  [ tab : datasets ] shows basic statistics of our graph datasets .",
    "each graph represents the largest connected component of the original graph as some datasets consist of one large connected component and many very small ones .",
    ".graph datasets and their parameters : number of vertices , number of edges , diameter , radius . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      recall that the _ eccentricity _ of a vertex @xmath6 of a graph @xmath3 , denoted by @xmath17 , is the maximum distance from @xmath6 to any other vertex of @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "the _ diameter _",
    "@xmath15 of @xmath3 is the largest eccentricity of a vertex in @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "the _ radius _ @xmath19 of @xmath3 is the smallest eccentricity of a vertex in @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "a vertex @xmath25 of @xmath3 with @xmath26 ( i.e. , a smallest eccentricity vertex ) is called a _ central vertex _ of @xmath3 .",
    "the _ center _",
    "@xmath27 of @xmath3 is the set of all central vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "let also @xmath28 be the set of vertices of @xmath3 furthest from @xmath6 .    in general ( even unweighted ) graphs ,",
    "it is still an open problem whether the diameter and/or the radius of a graph @xmath3 can be computed faster than the time needed to compute the entire distance matrix of @xmath3 ( which requires @xmath29 time for a general unweighted graph ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is known that both , the diameter and the radius , of a tree @xmath30 can be calculated in linear time . that can be done by using 2 breadth - first - search ( bfs ) scans as follows .",
    "pick an arbitrary vertex @xmath7 of @xmath30 . run a bfs starting from @xmath7 to find @xmath31 run a second bfs starting from @xmath6 to find @xmath32 then @xmath33 i.e. , @xmath34 is a _",
    "diametral pair _ of @xmath30 , and @xmath35 . to find the center of @xmath30 it suffices to take one or two adjacent middle vertices of the @xmath36-path of @xmath30 .",
    "interestingly , in  @xcite , chepoi et al . established that this approach of 2 bfs - scans can be adapted to provide fast ( in linear time ) and accurate approximations of the diameter , radius , and center of any finite set @xmath37 of @xmath38-hyperbolic geodesic spaces and graphs . in particular , for a @xmath38-hyperbolic graph @xmath3 , it was shown that if @xmath39 and @xmath40 then @xmath41 and @xmath42 furthermore , the center @xmath27 of @xmath3 is contained in the ball of radius @xmath43 centered at a middle vertex @xmath25 of any shortest path connecting @xmath6 and @xmath44 in @xmath3 .    since our graph datasets have small hyperbolicities ,",
    "according to  @xcite , few ( 2 , 3 , 4 , ... ) bfs - scans , each next starting at a vertex last visited by the previous scan ) should provide a pair of vertices @xmath45 and @xmath46 such that @xmath47 is close to the diameter @xmath15 of @xmath3 .",
    "surprisingly ( see table  [ tab : diamradius ] ) , few bfs - scans were sufficient to get exact diameters of all of our datasets : for 13 datasets , 2 bfs - scans ( just like for trees ) were sufficient to find the exact diameter of a graph .",
    "two datasets needed 3 bfs - scans to find the diameter , and only one dataset required 4 bfs - scans to get the diameter .",
    "we also computed the eccentricity of a middle vertex of a longest shortest path produced by these few bfs - scans and reported this eccentricity as an estimation for the graph radius .",
    "it turned out that the eccentricity of that middle vertex was equal to the exact radius for 6 datasets , was only one apart from the exact radius for 8 datasets , and only for 2 datasets was two units apart from the exact radius .",
    "based on solid theoretical foundations , we presented strong evidences that a number of real - life networks , taken from different domains like internet measurements , biological datasets , web graphs , social and collaboration networks , exhibit metric tree - like structures .",
    "we investigated a few graph parameters , namely , the tree - distortion and the tree - stretch , the tree - length and the tree - breadth , the gromov s hyperbolicity , the cluster - diameter and the cluster - radius in a layering partition of a graph , which capture and quantify this phenomenon of being metrically close to a tree .",
    "recent advances in theory allowed us to calculate or accurately estimate these parameters for sufficiently large networks .",
    "all these parameters are at most constant or ( poly)logarithmic factors apart from each other .",
    "specifically , graph parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 are within small constant factors from each other .",
    "parameters @xmath53 and @xmath54 are within factor of at most @xmath55 from @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "tree - stretch @xmath53 is within factor of at most @xmath56 from hyperbolicity @xmath54 .",
    "one can summarize those relationships with the following chains of inequalities : @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 if one of these parameters or its average version has small value for a large scale network , we say that that network has a metric tree - like structure .",
    "among these parameters theoretically smallest ones are @xmath54 , @xmath52 and @xmath50 ( @xmath50 being at most @xmath61 ) .",
    "our experiments showed that average versions of @xmath51 and of @xmath48 have also very small values for the investigated graph datasets . in table",
