    "we are currently witnessing the beginning of a quantum engineering revolution , marking a shift from `` classical devices '' which are macroscopic systems described by deterministic or stochastic equations , to `` quantum devices '' which exploit fundamental properties of quantum mechanics , with applications ranging from computation to secure communication and metrology @xcite . while control theory developed from the need for predictability in the behavior of `` classical '' dynamical systems , quantum filtering and quantum feedback control theory deals with similar questions in the mathematical framework of quantum dynamical systems .",
    "system identification is an essential component of control theory , which deals with the estimation of unknown dynamical parameters of input - output systems @xcite .",
    "a similar task arises in the quantum set - up , and various aspects of the _ quantum system identification _ problem have been considered in the recent literature , cf . for a shortlist of recent results .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the class of _ passive linear quantum system _ which have been extensively studied in recent years @xcite , and can be used to describe or approximate a large number of physical systems @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a number of quantum variables ( e.g. the electromagnetic field inside an optical cavity ) , and is coupled with the quantum stochastic input consisting of non - commuting noise processes ( e.g. a laser impinging onto the cavity mirror ) . as a result of the quantum mechanical interaction between system and input , the latter is transformed into an output quantum signal which can be measured to produce a classical stochastic measurement process . in this context , we address the problem of identifying the linear system by appropriately choosing the state of its input and performing measurements on the output ( see figure [ sys i d setup ] ) .    in this `` time - dependent input '' scenario",
    "we characterize the equivalence class of systems with the same input - output relation ( transfer function ) , find a canonical parametrization of the space of equivalence classes in terms of physical parameters , and investigate special parametric models in which the system is fully identifiable .",
    "these results are the first steps of an ongoing project aimed at designing statistically and computationally efficient input states , output measurements , and estimators , as well as characterising the class of equivalent systems in the `` stationary input '' scenario , which involves the analysis of the power spectrum .",
    "although our investigations are guided and motivated by classical results going back to @xcite , the quantum setting imposes specific constraints and the goal is to identify quantum features related with e.g. unitarity , entanglement and uncertainty principles .",
    "setup of system identification for linear quantum systems .",
    "the experimenter can prepare a time - dependent input state , and perform a continuous - time measurement on the output , from which the unknown system parameters @xmath0 are estimated .",
    "the input - output relation is encoded in the transfer function @xmath1 . ]",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the set - up of linear quantum systems , and formulate the system identification problem . in section iii",
    "we show that two minimal systems have the same transfer function if and only if their associated hamiltonian and coupling matrices are related by a unitary transformation ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th.equivalence.class ] ) , amounting to a change of basis in the space of continuous variables modes .",
    "this yields a necessary and sufficient condition for the identifiability of a passive linear system , which is then applied to several examples with different hamiltonian parametrizations . in section",
    "iv we provide a concrete characterisation of the identifiable set of parameters with direct interpretation in terms of the coupling and hamiltonian matrices . finally , in section v we characterize a wide class of identifiable quantum linear networks , by employing the concept of `` infection '' introduced in @xcite .",
    "we use the following notations : for a matrix @xmath2 , the symbols @xmath3 , @xmath4 represent its hermitian conjugate and transpose of @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . for a matrix of operators , @xmath8 , we use the same notation , in which case @xmath9 denotes the adjoint to @xmath10 .",
    "in this section we briefly review the framework of linear classical and quantum dynamical systems and then formulate the quantum identifiability problem .",
    "a classical linear system is described by the set of differential equations @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the state of the system , @xmath13 is an input signal , and @xmath14 is the output signal .",
    "the observer can control the input signal and observe the output , but does not have access to the internal state of the system .",
    "the input signal can be deterministic , in which case we deal with a set of odes or stochastic , in which case the equations should be interpreted as sdes . apart from the input and the initial state of the system , the dynamics is determined by the ( real ) matrices @xmath15 .    to find the relation between input and output it is convenient to work in the laplace domain .",

    "the identifiability problem is closely related to the fundamental system theory concepts of _ controllability _ and _ observability_. the system is controllable if for any states @xmath22 and times @xmath23 there exists a ( piece - wise continuous ) input @xmath24 such that the initial and final states are given by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to the fact that the controllability matrix @xmath27 $ ] has full row rank .",
    "the system is observable if for any times @xmath23 , the initial state @xmath25 can be determined from the history of the input and output on the time interval @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "this is in turn equivalent to the fact that the observability matrix @xmath29^{t}$ ] has full column rank .",
    "the importance of these concepts for identifiability stems from the fact that if the system is _ not _ controllable or observable then there exists a lower dimensional system with the same transfer function as the original one .",
    "the former can be obtained from the latter by separating it s coordinates via a canonical procedure called kalman decomposition .",
    "therefore , in system identification it is natural to restrict the attention to _ minimal _ systems , i.e. systems which are both controllable and observable . as noted above",

    "then , can be written @xmath257       \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc }         \\omega_{11 } & |e'| \\\\         |e'|^\\top & \\tilde\\lambda \\\\",

    "as shown above , the middle matrix can be completely identified from the transfer function @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , all the eignevalues of @xmath40 can now be determined .",
    "let us now summarize the result .    the equivalence class of systems having a given transfer function @xmath21 is completely parametrised by the set of parameters @xmath259 , which are directly computed from @xmath21 using the above procedure . in particular , the system parameter @xmath0 and the eigenvalues of @xmath40 can be identified .    to describe the general case , we assume that the @xmath260 matrix @xmath66 is of rank @xmath41 ; roughly speaking , this means that all the injected input fields couple with the system . furthermore ,",
    "we assume @xmath261 ; in this case , without loss of generality , @xmath66 can be expressed as @xmath262 with @xmath263 a @xmath264 full rank complex matrix .",
    "correspondingly , we represent @xmath40 as in the same form , in which case @xmath238 is a @xmath264 hermitian matrix .",
    "then , as in the previous case we have @xmath265 this means that @xmath263 can be represented in terms of a known strictly positive matrix @xmath266 and an arbitrary unitary matrix @xmath267 as @xmath268 .",
    "moreover , @xmath269              + \\frac{i}{2}\\tilde{c}_0^\\dagger\\tilde{c}_0,\\ ] ] which means that @xmath238 can be determined up to the unitary rotation by @xmath267 .",
    "now , we are given @xmath270 which means that , from the same procedure as in the simple case , we can determine the eigenvalues of @xmath251 and @xmath271 from @xmath272 .",
    "then , consequently , the eigenvalues of @xmath40 can be constructed .",
    "in this section we treat a special class of models , which are identifiable thanks to the special structure of the hamiltonian .",
    "this class was shown to be identifiable in different contexts in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath273 be the set of vertices representing the modes of our continuous variables system .",
    "the interactions between the different modes are modeled by the set of edges @xmath274 over @xmath273 : @xmath275 so that two modes @xmath246 and @xmath276 interact if they are connected by an edge .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the matrix @xmath40 describing the system hamiltonian is of the form @xmath277 where @xmath278 are unknown _ real _ coefficients which make up the parameter @xmath0 and @xmath279^t$ ] is the basis vector having zeros except the @xmath246th element .",
    "we further assume that the coupling between the system and the field is known and specified by the matrix @xmath66 whose support is spanned by a set of basis vectors @xmath280 for some set of vertices @xmath281 , the restriction of @xmath282 to this subspace being strictly positive .     infection property .",
    "the colored node indicates that it is infected , and the arrow indicates that the infection occurs along that edge . through the steps from (",
    "a ) to ( e ) , the network becomes infected . ]    the crucial property we will require of @xmath281 is that it is _ infecting _ for the graph @xmath283 , which can be defined sequentially by the following conditions ( see fig .",
    "[ infection graph ] ) :    * at the beginning the vertices in @xmath281 are infected ; * if an infected vertex has only one non - infected neighbour , the neighbour gets infected ; * after some interactions all nodes end up infected .",
    "roughly speaking , this infection property means that the network is similar to a  chain \" , where the neighboring nodes are coupled to each other .",
    "such a chain structure often appears in practical situations , and as shown in @xcite , it can be fully controlled by only accessing to its local subsystem .",
    "also it is notable that in general a chain structure realizes fast spread of quantum information @xcite and is thus suitable for e.g. distributing quantum entanglement .",
    "the result we present here is that such a useful network is always identifiable under a mild condition .",
    "[ infection theorem ] let @xmath284 be given by eq .  , and assume that the support of @xmath66 is spanned by @xmath285 with @xmath286 having the infecting property .",
    "then , if the system is minimal , @xmath284 is identifiable .",
    "recall that by theorem [ similarity transformation ] two parameters are in the same equivalence class if and only if there exists an @xmath32 unitary matrix @xmath185 such that @xmath287 and @xmath288 the latter condition implies @xmath289= 0 $ ] and in particular @xmath185 commutes with projection @xmath290 onto the support of @xmath282 so that @xmath291 with @xmath292 unitary on the orthogonal complement of the support of @xmath66 .",
    "let us write the hamiltonian in the block form according to the partition @xmath293 : @xmath294 then eq .   implies that @xmath295 the identity means that @xmath296 furthermore , since @xmath281 is infecting , there exists at least one vertex @xmath297 which is connected to exactly one vertex @xmath298 , so that @xmath299 can be written as @xmath300 eq",
    ".   then implies @xmath301 which means that @xmath302 is an eigenvector of @xmath292 and @xmath303 for some phase @xmath304 .",
    "but since the coefficients of @xmath284 are assumed to be real , this implies that @xmath305 additionally , since @xmath306 , a decomposition of the form holds with the identity block supported by the index set @xmath307 .",
    "the same argument can now be repeated for the set @xmath308 , and by using the infecting property , all vertices will be eventually included in the growing set of indices , so that at the end we have @xmath309 .",
    "consequently , from corollary [ similarity transformation ] , the system is identifiable .    from this result , we now readily see that the chain system studied in example  3.1 in section  iii  c is identifiable , since clearly this system is infecting . on the other hand ,",
    "the tree and the ring structural systems examined in the same section are not infecting , hence theorem  [ infection theorem ] states nothing about the identifiability of these systems ; in fact , as shown there , the tree system is identifiable , while the ring one is not .",
    "in theorem [ equivalent class ] we have shown that minimal passive linear systems with the same transfer function are related by unitary transformations .",
    "this is different from classical systems where the equivalence class is given by similarity transformations , the reason for that being the more rigid structure of the system equations and in the case of passive quantum systems .",
    "the characterisation of the equivalence class for general `` active '' linear systems remains an open problem .",
    "another important issue which was addressed only briefly here is how to actually estimate the system parameters .",
    "more precisely , what kind of input state should be chosen and what measurement should be performed on the output .",
    "the performance of such a design of experiment can be measured by using statistical tools such as fisher information and asymptotic normality .",
    "finally , the system identification problem can be considered in a different setting , where the input fields are stationary ( quantum noise ) but have a non - trivial covariance matrix ( squeezing ) . in this case the characterisation of the equivalence classes boils down to finding the systems with the same power spectral density , a problem which is well understood in the classical setting @xcite but not yet addressed in the quantum domain ."
