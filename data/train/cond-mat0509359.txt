    "the discovery and confirmation of superconductivity in diamond heavily doped with boron@xcite has provoked interest in the mechanism and character of the pairing that is responsible .",
    "there are several confirmations of superconductivity around 4 k for 2 - 3% doping , and a recent report@xcite indicates t@xmath2 11.5 k for 4.7% boron concentration in homoepitaxial films . while the picture of 3% hole - doped diamond as a degenerate metal has been the most common assumption,@xcite there has also been the possibility that the boron acceptor level is too deep for itinerant conductivity to arise , leading to a picture of a non - degenerate doped semiconductor@xcite with possible correlated behavior.@xcite an angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) study@xcite on heavily b - doped diamond has found the fermi level to lie a few tenths of an ev within the valence bands , establishing the degenerate - metal picture as the correct one for this system .",
    "it is useful to review briefly the history of b doping of diamond .",
    "although it has been clear for decades that b is responsible for the color of blue diamonds , and the desire for p - type semiconducting diamond has been intense for some time , the existing information about the isolated b acceptor is sketchy .",
    "the energy of the acceptor level is agreed to be e@xmath3=0.37 ev.@xcite this binding energy is too large for this impurity to be treated accurately at the effective mass level , hence its wave function is not as greatly extended as that of a shallow level would be . on the other hand ,",
    "this is not truly a deep level ( since e@xmath3 is only 7% of the band gap ) in which the defect state extends over only a shell or two of neighboring c atoms .",
    "the existing theoretical studies aimed at gleaning information about the b acceptor state are not very conclusive .",
    "finite clusters ( up to 59 atoms ) were used by mainwood,@xcite who obtained for substitutional b a threefold degenerate , mainly b @xmath4 , state 0.36 ev above the uppermost occupied diamond valence state .",
    "the cluster was allowed to relax , with the b - c bonds increasing by 10% ( 0.15",
    " ) , a much larger amount than has been obtained in more recent calculations . the very limited cluster size , with its surface effects , does not allow for clear conclusions .",
    "et al . _ reported some results from 64 atoms ( periodic ) supercells,@xcite but as we show here for a larger supercell , the local density approximation ( lda ) does not produce a gap acceptor state at such densities ( @xmath5 1% ) .",
    "a tight - binding total energy method was used by sitch _",
    "et al . _ , who reported only atomic relaxation using a 216 atom supercell.@xcite c atoms neighboring the substitutional b relaxed outward by 4% ( bond length of 1.60   ) .",
    "their study was focused instead on doping of amorphous carbon .    adopting the arpes demonstration@xcite that the fermi level lies within the itinerant valence bands ,",
    "there are a few choices to be made in describing the electronic structure , and the subsequent evaluation of the character and strength of the electron - phonon ( ep ) coupling is determined to some extent by this choice .",
    "the published studies of superconductivity in b - doped diamond concur that ep coupling provide the pairing mechanism , in spite of applying different approximations to achieve their separate estimates .",
    "we briefly describe the various approaches .",
    "three groups have adopted the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) , making use of the fact that b is chemically and physically similar to c , especially when they share a common environment ; in this case each is surrounded by c atoms on a diamond lattice . in such cases ,",
    "the itinerant wavefunctions average over the b and c atoms and replacing each nucleus by an average charge constitutes the vca . adopting the vca , boeri , kortus , and andersen@xcite then applied linear response theory for harmonic phonons and calculated the phonon frequencies at @xmath550 q points .",
    "this allowed the evaluation of the ep spectral function and strength of coupling .",
    "lee and pickett@xcite also adopted the vca for the underlying electronic structure .",
    "as suggested by the analogy with mgb@xmath6 where holes are doped into strong covalent bonds , they found a very large ep matrix element for the bond - stretch mode and , making use of the small fermi surfaces , assumed it varied slowly with wavevector q up to 2k@xmath7 ( k@xmath7 is the fermi wavevector ) .",
    "they calculated by the frozen phonon method the phonon renormalization of the bond - stretch mode by the doped carriers , and from two related but separate directions arrived at the ep coupling strength . also adopting the vca viewpoint , ma _",
    "et al._@xcite used methods very similar to those of boeri _ et al . _ ( but different codes ) and the same phonon mesh , but studied electron doping as well as hole doping .",
    "blase , adessi , and conntable@xcite and xiang _",
    "et al._@xcite , on the other hand , used a supercell approach in which the b dopants keep their chemical identity ( actual b atoms ) , but to apply standard solid state methods the dopant atoms had to be repeated periodically .",
    "this supercell approach restricts dopant concentrations to certain commensurate fractions but this is no real limitation because b concentrations are only known approximately .",
    "et al . _ calculated phonons and ep coupling only at q=0 in a 54 atom ( bc@xmath8 ) supercell and estimated the coupling strength accordingly .",
    "treated both 16 atom and 36 atoms supercells , using phonons at a few q points .",
    "naturally the various calculations contain differences in detail and in general it is not possible to compare several of the intermediate results .",
    "both groups using the supercell approach have suggested that there are aspects of their results that make the supercell approach superior , or perhaps necessary .",
    "on the other hand , the arpes data@xcite lead to band dispersions very much like the diamond ( or vca ) bands , perhaps broadened by disorder .",
    "there is another approach to the treatment of randomly positioned dopant atoms , the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "the cpa allows the dopant to retain its identity , but produces an effective medium that accounts for random disorder .",
    "the cpa method has not been applied to evaluate the ep coupling in b - doped diamond , which is possible in principle , because linear response theory for phonons has not yet been incorporated into cpa codes .",
    "it is straightforward however to calculate the cpa electronic structure of b - doped diamond and compare results with the vca and supercell approaches . in this paper we study in sec .",
    "iii selected supercells , and then provide cpa results ( sec .",
    "iv ) for dilute b in diamond and make some comparisons both to supercell results and the vca bands ( which are hardly distinguishable from the diamond bands for small b concentrations ) .",
    "using supercells we can study effects due to b - b interaction , and quantify specific effects that arise because of the periodicity that is imposed .",
    "it is also easy when using the supercell approach to evaluate the effect of b on the various shells of c neighbors .",
    "the cpa accounts for random positioning of the dopants and also allows the evaluation of disorder broadening of the bands ( sec .",
    "we make a few observations about relaxation around a substitutional b atoms ( sec .",
    "v ) which is not included in either the vca or cpa method , and in sec .",
    "vi provide a summary of the implications of our results .",
    "the bulk diamond bond length is d@xmath9= 1.54  . for a substitutional b atom , the b@xmath10c bond length",
    "is increased by 2% and the neighboring c - c bond length is decreased by 1.3% in a lda calculation with @xmath11 fcc primitive cell ( bc@xmath8).@xcite we have carried out calculations of  ordered impurities \" using several supercells and of  randomly disordered impurities \" using the cpa method , both of them with the full - potential nonorthogonal local - orbital minimum - basis scheme ( fplo).@xcite the cpa@xcite method implemented in fplo is based on the blackman - esterling - berk theory@xcite that includes random off - diagonal matrix elements in the local orbital representation .",
    "_ provide a discussion of how randomness is treated in this atomic - orbital based procedure.@xcite    we have used three types of supercells : a large symmetric cell , a doubled cubic cell only in a ( 001 ) plane and a set of layered cells . a @xmath12 fcc primitive cell ( bc@xmath1 )",
    "was used as a symmetric cell and @xmath13 cubic cell ( bc@xmath14 ) also was studied .",
    "the latter ( @xmath15 doping ) is very close to the initally reported @xmath16 doping superconductor .",
    "in addition , we used several supercells [ ( @xmath17 ( bc@xmath18 ) to @xmath19 ( bc@xmath20 ) ] layered in the @xmath21-direction , which illustrated some systematic variations .",
    "the low level of b doping requires a sufficiently fine @xmath22 point grid to sample the few unoccupied valence states that arise . because of the different size of each brillouin zone ( bz ) , @xmath22 points used are different from each other , but we have used from 245 to 1000 @xmath22 points in the irreducible wedge of each bz , except for @xmath12 supercell . for the @xmath12 supercell , 3 irreducible @xmath22 points should be enough to understand the band structure .",
    "however , cpa requires a much finer @xmath22 mesh to sample the wavevector and energy dependent spectral function , so 2045 @xmath22 points were used in the irreducible wedge . for all calculations , valence orbitals",
    "for the basis set contained @xmath23 for b and c.",
    "first we address the supercell having a b concentration ( @xmath24 ) very close to the initially reported superconducting concentration ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the upper portion of the valence band structures of the @xmath26 supercell is compared with that of intrinsic diamond in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ band221 ] . for better comparison ,",
    "the bands of intrinsic diamond are raised by the fermi energy ( e@xmath7 ) difference from the doped diamond so that the bands are aligned at the valence band maximum ( vbm ) .",
    "b doping has three separate effects that are common to all of the supercells : ( 1 ) lowering e@xmath7 owing to hole doping ( opposite direction to the effect of c doping in mg(b@xmath27c@xmath28)@xmath6,@xcite ) ( 2 ) band splittings at the high symmetry points in the bz reflecting symmetry breaking , and ( 3 ) bandshifts reflecting the difference in the b and c potentials .",
    "the largest effect of the b doping occurs @xmath29 ev below the fermi level , which is easily seen on the @xmath30 plane ( z - r - a - z lines in fig .",
    "[ band221 ] ) .",
    "three bands along these lines are raised in energy by more than 1 ev by the addition of boron ; the strong b character of these displaced bands is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ band221 ] , where the `` fatband '' representation emphasizing b character is presented .",
    "these rather flat bands are strongly hybridized with the nearest neighbor ( nn ) c @xmath4 states , which provide about one - third of the band character . at the vbm which is threefold degenerate in intrinsic diamond , the b character and the nn c @xmath4 character",
    "are also strongly mixed .",
    "besides the mixing , the top of the valence bands at the @xmath31 point in the b - doped diamond shows a tiny band splitting of 42 mev , as shown in inset of the top panel of fig .",
    "[ band221 ] .",
    "the origin of the splitting is not clear but its value is probably specific to this supercell .",
    "the corresponding atom - projected dos are given in fig .",
    "[ dos221 ] . as expected from the strong local b@xmath10c mixing",
    ", the b dos resembles that of the nn c dos .",
    "more specifically , however , the b and nn c are enhanced at the vbm .",
    "their spectral densities show differences : the b dos has much sharper peaks around @xmath32 ev while that of the nn c continues more strongly to -4 to -6 ev . to summarize :",
    "the weights of the doss are arranged in the order of b , nn c , second neighbor ( 2nd",
    "n ) c , and bulk c , in order of increasing binding energy.@xcite this trend is consistent with the interpretation of x - ray absorption and emission spectroscopy by nakamura et al.@xcite      as large a supercell calculation as possible is desirable to extract information about the isolated b impurity .",
    "we first study the change in the band structure , keeping in mind that it reflects the periodic arrangement of the 0.8% concentration of b substitutionals in this supercell .",
    "the symmetry is such that the threefold degeneracy of the vbm is not split .",
    "the effective masses are changed very little , but we have not tried to identify possible changes in masses at the 1% level .",
    "splitting of degeneracies by @xmath33 ev can be seen at various places in the bands in fig .",
    "[ band444 ] : along @xmath31-x and at l near @xmath34 ev .",
    "there are larger splittings ( at l , for example ) at energies below @xmath32 ev in fig .",
    "[ band444 ] . at the @xmath31 point , the cluster of degenerate bands at @xmath35 ev in intrinsic diamond ( coming from zone folding ) are split and shifted considerably by b addition .",
    "the threefold degenerate bands at -0.9 ev , having strong b character , have been raised by 0.5 ev , while others are shifted little .",
    "thus even this large supercell shows effects of the periodicity of b atoms that will not be present if b atoms are distributed randomly .",
    "these effects are most evident when they produce new pieces of fermi surface related specifically to the artificial periodicity , as is beginning to be the case in fig .",
    "3 along the l - w line .",
    "a higher doping level than the 0.8% of this supercell could lead to inaccuracies in properties determined by the fermi surface , such as the electron - phonon spectral function .",
    "a set of layered supercells were studied to observe closely the asymmetry , changes in doping concentration , and effect of increasing the separation of the b atoms .",
    "although the doped b concentration ( 2.5% to 6.25 % ) varies in the each calculation , the band structures show considerable similarities . the upper portion of the valence band structures of the @xmath36 supercell is shown in fig .",
    "[ 113band ] .",
    "bands of strong b @xmath4 character are pushed upward into the -1.5 to -0.5 ev range along the x - m and r - a lines .",
    "this is the same energy range where b character is ` pushed ' in the other supercells .",
    "the total dos of the ( 1,1,@xmath37 ) cubic supercells ( @xmath37=2,3,4,5 ) , corresponding to @xmath38=0.0625 , 0.0417 , 0.0313 and 0.025 , are presented in fig .",
    "[ zdos ] and show an interesting trend . as indicated by the arrows ,",
    "decreasing @xmath38 leads to a sharp peak at @xmath39 ev and enhancement around 0.4 ev . with decreasing @xmath38 , the lowest of the bands shown in fig .",
    "[ 113band ] along the x - m line becomes flatter , resulting in enlargement of the peak at @xmath39 ev .",
    "as suggested by xiang et al.,@xcite we find that the width of the acceptor states ( unoccupied portion of the valence bands ) , containing one hole per supercell , depends on @xmath38 up to a certain value .",
    "note that the unoccupied part of n(e ) is essentially the same in the ( 1,1,4 ) and ( 1,1,5 ) supercells .",
    "now we describe cpa calculations which explicitly treat randomly distributed b substitutionals with concentration @xmath38 .",
    "we calculate @xmath400.005=1/200 to approximate an isolated boron , and @xmath400.025 very close to the optimal superconducting concentration @xmath41 .",
    "the cpa spectral density for @xmath38=0.025 , rendered as a  smeared \" band structure , is displayed in the full band region in fig .",
    "[ fullband ] .",
    "the bands are like those from the virtual crystal approximation used earlier@xcite except that lifetime effects ( appearing as a broadening ) are visible .",
    "the effect of disorder is strongest in the conduction ( unoccupied ) band near 17 ev .",
    "the valence ( occupied ) band is less affected . even for only 2.5% b - doping ,",
    "the disordered broading is clearly visible in the doubly degenerate band near @xmath42 along @xmath31-l , and near @xmath43 ev along the x - w line .",
    "the former comes from mixing with b @xmath4 states and the latter has more admixture of b @xmath44 states .",
    "it is of course no accident that the disorder broadening resulting from the cpa treatment is largest in the valence band ( in the zero to -2 ev region relative to e@xmath7 ) where the b - derived band shifts are largest .",
    "the broadening arises because the quantum mechanical averaging of the wavefunction over the atomic potentials becomes less systematic in energy regions where the atomic potentials differ more . in this case",
    "a single well - defined band persists but with larger broadening . in strong scattering systems ( which it turns out",
    "this is not ) , split - band behavior can result .    because the behavior near @xmath42 is important for ( super)conductivity , the blowup of the spectral densities near @xmath42 along the k-@xmath31-l line for @xmath38=0.005 and @xmath38=0.025",
    "are given in fig .",
    "[ smallband ] . increasing the b content ( @xmath38 ) increases the chemical disorder broadening , in addition to lowering e@xmath7 .",
    "the change of the disorder broadening at the @xmath31 point is different from that of the l point , because the main b @xmath4 character is located just below @xmath45 ev at @xmath38=0.025 .",
    "( see below . ) as a result , the broadening at the @xmath31 point is half of that at the l point at @xmath400.025 , while the width at the @xmath31 point is 10% wider than at the l point at @xmath38=0.005 .",
    "thus disorder broadening effects ( such as the residual resistivity ) will be nonlinear in @xmath38 in this region .",
    "the atom - projected b and c dos from cpa at @xmath38=0.025 is shown in fig .",
    "[ cpados ] .",
    "the dos is similar to those from supercell calculations , but without sharp peaks in the range of @xmath45 ev and 0 ev that arise due to the periodic array of dopant b atoms .",
    "the b dos has a peak at @xmath45 ev and decreases asymmetrically .",
    "the c dos is hardly distinguishable from that of the bulk c. the weight of the b dos is closer to e@xmath7 than that of the c dos , as in the supercells . near @xmath42 ,",
    "the dos of b is 1.7 times larger than the dos of c , which indicates the b influence on metallic properties of c@xmath27b@xmath28 is greater than that of an average c atom ( but by less than a factor of two ) , consistent with measurement by soft x - ray absorption and emission spectroscopy.@xcite",
    "reports of the b - c bond length , when allowed to relax , differ .",
    "the 10% value reported in the cluster calculation of mainwood@xcite is clearly unrealistically large .",
    "et al . _ , using a realistic ( but not first principles ) method with large supercell ( 216 atoms ) found a 4% lengthening,@xcite while blase",
    "_ et al . _ , using first principles methods but only a 54 atom supercell , reported only a 2% elongation.@xcite these values are with respect to the c - c bond length of 1.54    for intrinsic diamond .",
    "the relaxed and unrelaxed band structures of the b - doped diamond for the @xmath13 supercell given in fig .",
    "[ scband ] show that the effect of the 2% elongated b - c bond length is to further raise the b - derived bands , _",
    "i.e. _ increase the separation from the bulk c bands , although the effect is not major ( a maximum of 60 mev ) .",
    "the region between @xmath46 ev to @xmath47 ev on the @xmath30 plane of this supercell is most strongest affected , as expected , since that is the region in which b @xmath4 states are strongly mixed with nn c @xmath4 states .",
    "this 2% relaxation results in a small ( 3% ) increase in the fermi energy ( by 25 mev ) , which can be considered as a slight increase in the effective mass .",
    "the magnitude of these shifts suggests that relaxation will change numerical results by a few percent but will not change significantly any of the general features of b doping that are discussed above .",
    "in this paper we have studied the boron spectral density relative to that of c , and quantified to some extent the disorder broadening , in b - doped diamond , using a combination of supercell and random disorder ( cpa ) approaches .",
    "all experimental results that we are aware of support the prevailing viewpoint that this system is a heavily - doped degenerate ( metallic ) semiconductor at the concentration range where superconductivity has been seen , and our studies lie only within this scenario .",
    "as far as the average distribution of b character in the itinerant band system is concerned , the cpa and supercell results are similar . in the region of interest ( around the fermi level for reported levels of doping ,",
    "not exceeding 5% ) , the cpa result is that the fraction of b character is 1.7 times that of a c atom .",
    "supercell results are consistent with this value , at least if a little energy - averaging is considered .    in the energy - momentum distribution of b character",
    ", however , the periodicity in the supercells leads to regions where a band has a much larger fraction of b character than 1.7@xmath38 ( the fraction of b character in b@xmath48 given by the cpa ) , and is split away from bands that are primarily c in character .",
    "this effect arises in both the smaller and the larger supercells ( 3% doping down to 0.8% ) .",
    "the cpa method , on the other hand , leads to bands much like those of intrinsic diamond but disorder broadened to some extent , and with a b content that varies smoothly along the band ( that is , with energy and with momentum ) .",
    "the cpa description is buttressed by arpes data,@xcite where mapping of the bands results in diamond - like band topology as occurs in the vca or ( accounting for disorder ) cpa .",
    "an attractive feature of the supercell method is its ability to investigate the local environment of the dopant atom , including lattice relaxations .",
    "while the cluster cpa method makes it possible within a disordered system , there is very little experience with this capability .",
    "the ability to relax atomic positions was used by blase _",
    "et al._@xcite , who obtained a 2% longer b - c bondlength than that of diamond ; this elongation will lead in turn to a change in the b - c force constant . whether this factor can account for the difference in spectral distributions obtained by the two supercell methods@xcite is yet to be resolved .",
