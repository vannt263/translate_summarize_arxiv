    "the main focus of the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) is to explore the phase transition related to the quark deconfinement and the chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the first available experimental data were the energy dependence of charged particle pseudorapidity density in central @xmath1 collisions at @xmath3=56 and 130 gev from the phobos collaboration @xcite . soon later",
    ", the phenix collaboration published their data of centrality dependence of the charged particle pseudorapidity density in @xmath1 collisions at @xmath3=130 gev @xcite . recently the charged particle pseudorapidity density in central @xmath1 collisions at @xmath3=200 gev was also reported by phobos collaboration @xcite .",
    "the brahms collaboration published more recently their results of charged particle density from au+au collisions at @xmath3=130 gev @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that the rare high charged multiplicity in the final state of relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions might indicate the formation of the quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) phase in the early stage of collisions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the centrality dependence of the charged multiplicity has been further proposed to provide information on the relative importance of soft versus hard processes in particle production and therefore to provide a means of distinguishing various theoretical models .",
    "the pqcd calculation with assumption of gluon saturation @xcite ( referred to as the ekrt model later ) was first used to study the centrality dependence of the charged particle pseudorapidity density at rhic . the conventional eikonal approach and",
    "the high density qcd ( referred to as the kn model later ) @xcite were also used to investigate the centrality dependence and these two methods surprisingly obtained almost identical centrality dependence .",
    "recently , authors in @xcite reported their study of the same issue from the dual parton model .",
    "it was found that the experimental observation , the charged particle pseudorapidity density per participant pair slightly increasing with the number of participant nucleons , was reproduced by @xcite , but contradicted the results of @xcite .    in this paper a hadron and string cascade model , jpciae @xcite ,",
    "was employed to study this issue further . within the framework of this model",
    "the experimentally measured energy dependence of the charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density per participant pair both in relativistic @xmath0 and @xmath1 collisions at rhic energies was reproduced fairly well without retuning the model parameters .",
    "the predictions for the @xmath2 collisions at lhc energy were also given .",
    "both the phenix @xcite and the phobos @xcite observations that the charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density per participant pair slightly increases with the number of participant nucleons could be reproduced fairly well by jpciae . in studying centrality dependence",
    "the focus was put on the uncertainties in the definitions and calculations of the number of participant nucleons . however , this study indicated that it is not suitable to use the charged particle mid- pseudorapidity density per participant pair as a function of the number of participant nucleons to constrain theoretical models for particle production , because the number of participant nucleons is not a well defined physical variable both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the effect of the different definitions in nuclear radius ( diffused or sharp ) on the number of participant nucleons , the charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density , and the charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density per participant pair as a function of the number of participant nucleons was discussed .",
    "a brief version of the part contents of this paper has been published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the jpciae model was developed based on pythia @xcite , which is a well known event generator for hadron - hadron collisions . in the jpciae model the radial position of a nucleon in colliding nucleus @xmath4 ( indicating the atomic number of this nucleus as well ) is sampled randomly according to the woods - saxon distribution @xmath5 where @xmath6 refers to the normal nuclear density , @xmath7 0.54 fm stands for the nuclear diffusion edge , and @xmath8 is the nuclear radius of nucleus @xmath4 .",
    "the solid angle of the nucleon is sampled uniformly in 4@xmath9 .",
    "each nucleon is given a beam momentum in z direction and zero initial momenta in x and y directions .",
    "the collision time of each colliding pair is calculated under the requirement that the least approach distance of the colliding pair along their straight line trajectory ( mean field potential is not taken into account in jpciae ) should be smaller than @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 refers to the total cross section .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon collision with the least collision time is then selected from the initial collision list to perform the first collision . both the particle list and the collision list",
    "are then updated such that the new collision list may consist of not only nucleon- nucleon collisions but also collisions between nucleons and produced particles and between produced particles themselves .",
    "the next collision is selected from the new collision list and the processes above are repeated until the collision list is empty .    for each collision pair",
    ", if its cms energy is larger than a given cut , we assume that strings are formed after the collision and pythia is used to deal with particle production .",
    "otherwise , the collision is treated as a two - body collision @xcite .",
    "the cut ( = 4 gev in the program ) was chosen by observing that jpciae correctly reproduces charged multiplicity distributions in @xmath12 collisions @xcite .",
    "an important feature of jpciae at relativistic energies is that qcd parton - parton scatterings are included through pythia @xcite , which causes charged particle yields to increase with collision energy as well as centrality since mini - jet production rates increase with energy and number of collisions suffered by participant nucleons .",
    "it should be noted that the jpciae model is not a simple superposition of nucleon - nucleon collisions since the rescattering among participant nucleons , spectator nucleons , and produced particles is taken into account .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more about the jpciae model .",
    "since the number of participant nucleons , @xmath13 , plays a crucial role in the presentation of phobos or phenix data we first make a study on @xmath13 .",
    "as the direct measurement of @xmath13 is not available , in the fixed target experiments the number of participant nucleons from the projectile nucleus with atomic number @xmath4 , for instance , is estimated by @xmath14 where @xmath15 refers to the energy deposited in the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) , dominated by the energy deposition from the projectile spectator nucleons , and @xmath16 is the kinetic energy of beam @xcite .",
    "however , in the collider experiments , in order to obtain @xmath13 one has to relate the measurements to the monte carlo simulations . in phenix , for instance , simulations for the response of the beam - beam counter and the zdc were used to calculate @xmath13 via the glauber model @xcite . in phobos , @xmath13 is derived by relating hijing simulations to the signals in the paddle counter @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath13 here is a model- dependent variable .",
    "theoretically , the number of participant nucleons in a collision of @xmath17 at impact parameter @xmath18 can be estimated in different ways :    1 .   in the geometry method",
    "@xcite @xmath19 reads @xmath20 where @xmath21=0 if @xmath220 and @xmath21=1 otherwise , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the nuclear density of the projectile ( target ) nucleus and the nuclear density is normalized to the atomic number .",
    "2 .   in the glauber model ,",
    "@xmath19 is calculated through @xmath25 }                + \\int{d^2st_b(\\vec s)[1-\\exp(-\\sigma_{in}t_a(\\vec b-\\vec s))]}\\ ] ] where @xmath2640 mb is the inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section at rhic energies and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) refers to the nuclear thickness function of nucleus @xmath4 ( @xmath29 ) and is normalized to @xmath4 ( @xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "3 .   in the dynamical simulation of @xmath17 collisions",
    ", @xmath19 can be estimated via counting the participant or spectator nucleons and averaging over events simulated at a given impact parameter @xmath18 . however , there are multifarious in simulating models such as : fritiof @xcite , venus @xcite , hijing @xcite , jpciae @xcite , urqmd @xcite , and ampt @xcite , etc . . not only is the theoretical uncertainty related to the calculation of @xmath19 in each of the above models large but also the definitions of participant nucleons or spectator nucleons are different among each other .",
    "we give only a necessary description for the following dynamical simulations mentioned in this paper : * in fritiof @xcite and hijing @xcite , the wounded nucleons , i.e. , nucleons which suffer at least one inelastic collision , are counted and identified as @xmath19 .",
    "it should be pointed out here that in fritiof and hijing the produced particles from the string fragmentation do not have rescattering . * in jpciae , we have counted the nucleons involved in at least one inelastic nucleon - nucleon collision with string excitation and identified them as @xmath19 . * in ampt @xcite ,",
    "the spectator nucleons , @xmath30 , are counted in the final state without rescattering and @xmath19 is then calculated through @xmath31 the spectator nucleons here refer to the nucleons with zero transverse momentum and beam energy in the final state of the ampt simulation .    in the phenix or phobos experiment ,",
    "centrality bin was defined by the cut in the particle multiplicity distribution and expressed as the percentage of geometrical ( total ) cross section @xcite , @xmath32 .",
    "however , in the theoretical calculation it is more convenient to define the centrality by impact parameter @xmath18 . in order to compare the experimental data of centrality dependence with the theoretical results a relation between @xmath32 and @xmath18",
    "is required , which is obtained from the definition of the geometrical cross section , that reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 fm , for instance , is the radius of nucleus @xmath4 with diffused edge .",
    "however , @xmath35= 7.5 fm is taken in our calculations since this value ( corresponding to @xmath36=7.2 b ) was used in @xcite to extract the number of participant nucleons in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we give in tab .",
    "1 the mapping between the centrality bin ( @xmath32 bin , selected from tab . 1 in @xcite ) and the @xmath18 bin according to eq .",

    "in addition , the results from other models were plotted as follows : the dashed and dotted - dash curves are from the hijing model @xcite with and without jet quenching , respectively , the solid curve are from the ekrt model @xcite .",

    "in the kn model , @xmath40 was the result of @xmath19 from the glauber model after averaging over centrality bin . in this approach ,",
    "the particle multiplicity and impact parameter were related by a gaussian distribution with parameters fixed via fitting the phobos charged multiplicity distribution .",

    "one knows from fig .",

    "4 ( a ) we compared the phenix data of charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density per participant pair ( full circles with shaded area of systematic errors ) @xcite with the results of the jpciae model ( full triangles ) and the results of other models ( obtained from @xcite directly ) : hijing ( the dotted curve ) , the kn model ( the solid curve ) , and ekrt ( the dashed curve ) .",
    "one sees that except ekrt , three other models predict an increase of @xmath46 as a function of @xmath40 though the theoretical results seem to underestimate the phenix data .",
    "such an increase can be understood in jpciae as a result of increasing hard parton scatterings per participant nucleon .",
    "4 ( b ) compared the phenix data to the results of single @xmath47 from jpciae normalized by the @xmath40 from different models ( taken from the corresponding curve in fig . 2 at the middle point of @xmath32 bins for kn , hijing , and ekrt models ) :",

    "4 ( b ) that starting from the charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density obtained in jpciae , but using @xmath40 from different models , the corresponding results of @xmath46 are different visibly among each other , in peripheral collisions especially . therefore it might be inappropriate using @xmath48 as a function of @xmath40 to distinguish various theoretical models for particle production since @xmath40 is not a well defined physical variable .",
    "if one uses the sharp nuclear radius , @xmath49 fm ( @xmath35=6.50 fm ) , instead of diffused one used above , the corresponding mapping between the centrality bin ( @xmath32 bin ) and the @xmath18 bin from eq .",
    "( 8) is given in tab .",
    "5 , 6 , and 7 give , respectively , the comparisons between the jpciae results of diffused nuclear radius and the jpciae results of sharp nuclear radius in the @xmath40 as a function of centrality , the @xmath47 as a function of centrality , and the @xmath50 as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "one knows from fig . 5 and 6 that there are observable discrepancies between the results of diffused nuclear radius and the results of sharp nuclear radius , in peripheral collisions especially .",
    "however , in the @xmath50 vs. @xmath40 plot both results are close to each other as shown in fig . 7 . that indicates again that it is hard using @xmath51 as a function of @xmath40 to distinguish various theoretical models for particle production since @xmath13 is not a well defined variable . as one sees from fig . 5 and 6",
    "that for most central collision both diffused and sharp nuclear radii work well in mapping centrality bin and @xmath18 bin therefore we do not redraw a figure as fig . 1 for sharp nuclear radius .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that using sharp nuclear radius in mapping centrality bin and @xmath18 bin is inconsistent with that the nuclear diffusion edge is introduced in woods - saxon distribution initiating the nucleons in nucleus .",
    "in summary , we used the hadron and string cascade model , jpciae , to investigate the energy and centrality dependences of charged particle pseudorapidity density at mid - pseudorapidity in relativistic @xmath0 and @xmath41 collisions .",
    "both the relativistic @xmath0 experimental data and the phobos and phenix data of @xmath1 collisions at rhic energies could be reproduced fairly well within the framework of the jpciae model without retuning any parameters .",

    "both the phenix @xcite and the phobos @xcite observations that the charged particle mid - pseudorapidity density per participant pair slightly increases with the number of participant nucleons could be reproduced fairly well by jpciae .",
    "this study shows that since @xmath40 is not a well defined physical variable both experimentally and theoretically it may be hard to use charged particle pseudorapidity density per participant pair at mid - pseudorapidity as a function of @xmath40 to distinguish various theoretical models for particle production . a discussion for the effects of the different definitions in nuclear radius ( diffused or sharp )",
