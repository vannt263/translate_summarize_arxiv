    "the observed structures of the universe are thought to originate from the gravitational condensation of primordial mass - energy fluctuations whose evolution depends on the power spectrum of the initial fluctuations , the amount and nature of the various matter components present in the early universe and the eventual existence of a cosmological constant .",
    "since most of the acting gravitational masses remain invisible , constraining cosmological scenario from astronomical observations has been one of the most fascinating challenge of the last decades . from the observations of the spatial galaxy distribution ( see de lapparent , this conference ) , and from dynamical studies of gravitational systems like galaxies or clusters of galaxies , it is possible to infer the amount of dark matter as well as its distribution , or to have insights into the clustering properties of the visible matter in the universe .",
    "however , none of these observations measures _ directly _ the total amount and the distribution of matter : angular or redshift surveys give the distribution of _ light _ associated with galaxies , and mass estimations of gravitational structures can only be obtained within the assumption that they are simple relaxed or virialised dynamical systems .",
    "dynamics of galaxy velocity fields seems an efficient and promising approach to map directly the potentials responsible from large - scale flows , but catalogs are still poor and some assumptions are still uncertain or poorly understood on a physical basis .",
    "gravitational lensing effects are fortunately a direct probe of deflecting masses in the universe . they allow to determine directly the amount of matter present along the line - of - sight from",
    "observed or reconstructed deflection angles . after the discovery of the first multiply imaged quasar ( walsh et al .",
    "1979 ) and the first observations of gravitational arcs ( soucail et al .",
    "1987 , 1988 ; lynds & petrossian 1986 ) and arclets ( fort et al . 1988 ) , gravitational lensing rapidly becomes one of the most useful tool for probing dark matter on all scales and cosmological parameter as well . in the following ,",
    "we summarize what we have learned from strong and weak lensing regimes in clusters of galaxies and how constraints on the cosmological parameters can , or could , be obtained .",
    "we will also discuss a technique for measuring gravitational shear that has been developed recently and which opens new perspectives for the observations and the analysis of lensing effect by large - scale structures , as those we discuss in the last section .",

    "let us remind the basic principles of the gravitational lensing effects . a deflecting mass changes the apparent position of a source @xmath8 into the apparent image position @xmath9 by the quantity @xmath10 : _",
    "s=_i+(_i )  .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath11 is the gradient of the two - dimensional ( projected along the line of sight at the angular position @xmath9 ) gravitational potential @xmath12 . the gravitational distortion of background objects is described by the jacobian of the transformation , namely the amplification matrix @xmath13 between the source and the image plane ( schneider , ehlers & falco 1992 ) : = , where @xmath14 is the convergence , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the shear components .",
    "they are related to the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath12 by : = 12 ^2 = _ crit . ;   _ 1=12(_,11-_,22 )  ;  _",
    "2=_,12  , where @xmath17 is the projected mass density and @xmath18 is the critical mass density which would exactly focus a light beam originating from the source on the observer plane .",
    "it depends on the angular diameter distances @xmath19 , ( where @xmath20 $ ] ) involved in the lens configuration : _",
    "crit.=c^24gd_osd_ol d_ls  .    depending on the ratio @xmath21 we most often distinguish for data analysis the strong lensing ( @xmath22 ) and the weak lensing ( @xmath23 ) regimes .",
    "note that the values of the cosmological parameters enter in the relationship between the angular distance and the redshift .",
    "this is this dependence that , in some cases , can be used to constrain @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "arcs and arclets correspond to strong lensing cases with @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "giant arcs form at the points where the determinant of the magnification matrix is ( close to ) infinite . to these points ( the critical lines )",
    "correspond the caustic lines in the source plane . from the position of the source with respect to the caustic line , one can easily define typical lensing configuration with formation of giant arcs from the merging of two or three images , or radial arcs and `` straight arc '' as well ( see fort & mellier 1994 , narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "0.3 truecm    some of these typical lensing cases have been observed in rich clusters of galaxies . for ms2137 - 23",

    "1995 ) , a2218 ( kneib et al . 1995 ) , very accurate models with image predictions have been done which provide among the most precise informations we have about the central condensation of dark matter of clusters of galaxies on scale of @xmath26 ( table 1 ) . in particular , giant arcs definitely demonstrate that clusters of galaxies are dominated by dark matter , with mass - to - light ratio ( m / l ) larger than 100 , which closely follows the geometry of the diffuse light distribution associated with the brightest cluster members . furthermore , since arcs occur when @xmath27 , clusters of galaxies must be much more concentrated , e.g. with a smaller core radius , than it was expected from their galaxy and x - ray gas distributions .",
    "note that the occurrence of arcs is also enhanced by the existence of additional clumps observed in most of rich clusters which increases the shear substantially ( bartelmann 1995 ) .",
    "the direct observations of substructures by using giant arcs confirm that clusters are dynamically young systems , therefore pointing towards a rather high value of @xmath0 .",
    "beyond the region of strong lensing , background galaxies are still weakly magnified .",
    "the light deviation induces a small increase of their ellipticity in the direction perpendicular to the gradient of the projected potential ( shear ) . despite the intrinsic ellipticity of the sources and some observational or instrumental effects it is possible to make statistical analysis of this coherent polarization of the images of background galaxies and to recover the mass distribution of the lens .",
    "these weakly distorted galaxies are like a background distorted grid which can be used to probe the projected mass density @xmath17 of the foreground lens .",
    "the shape parameters of the images @xmath28 are related to the shape parameters of the sources @xmath29 by the equation ,    1truecm    m^s= a m^i a , where @xmath30 are the second order momenta of objects and @xmath31 the magnification matrix .",
    "we thus have a relation between the ellipticity of the sources @xmath32 and the observed ellipticity of the images @xmath33 : _ s= _ i - g 1-g _ i  ;  g=1-",
    ". in particular , if the sources are randomly distributed then their averaged intrinsic ellipticity verifies @xmath34 and we have g=_i  . since the main domain of application of the weak lensing is the large - scale distribution of the dark matter , at scale above @xmath35 , the analysis has been mainly focussed on the weak lensing regime , where @xmath36 .",
    "the relations between the physical ( @xmath37 ) and observable ( @xmath38 ) quantities are then simpler , since we have , _ i=",
    ". the projected mass density @xmath17 of the lens can be obtained from the distortion field by using eq.(8 ) and the integration of eq .",
    "( 3 ) ( kaiser & squires 1993 ) : ( _ i)=-2 ^2  ( -_i ) ( -_i)^2 ( _ i ) + _ 0  ;  ( ) = ( _ 1 ^ 2- _ 2 ^ 2 ^ 2  ,   2_1 _ 2 ^2 ) , where @xmath39 is the integration constant . in the weak lensing regime ,",
    "eqs.(9 ) provides a mapping of the total projected mass , using the distortion of the background objects .",
    "2.0 truecm    several improvements of the basic theory of lensing inversion have been discussed in details by seitz & schneider ( 1995 , 1996 ) , schneider ( 1995 ) and kaiser ( 1996 ) .",
    "note that the objects are also magnified by a factor @xmath40 which , in case of the weak lensing regime , has the form , = 1 + 2  .",
    "this gives potentially another independent way to measure the projected mass density @xmath17 of a lens using the magnification instead of the distortion .",
    "table 2 gives a summary of the clusters for which lensing inversion have been attempted .",
    "when compare with mass distribution inferred from strong lensing , there is a clear trend towards higher @xmath41 when the scale increases .",
    "bonnet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) found @xmath41 close to 600 at 2.5 from the cluster center .",
    "note also the remarkable results from kaiser & luppino on a cluster at redshift 0.83 , for which the estimated mass strongly depends on the redshifts of the sources . indeed in general the estimation of the cluster mass using eq .",
    "( 9 ) requires the knowledge of @xmath18 , which depends on the usually poorly known redshifts of the sources . though this is not a critical issue for nearby clusters ( @xmath42 ) , because then @xmath43 , it could lead to large mass uncertainties for more distant clusters it is the case for ms1054 .",
    "actually , even if the redshift of the sources were known , it would still not be possible to get the absolute value of the mass distribution , because possible mass planes of constant density intercepting the line of sight do not change the shear map .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to the unknown integration constant @xmath39 in eq.(10 ) .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken if one measures the magnification @xmath40 which depends on the mass quantity inside the light beam ( eq.(3 ) ) . while the shear measurement does not require any information in the source plane , the magnification measurement needs the observation of a reference ( unlensed ) field to calibrate the magnification .",
    "broadhurst et al .",
    "( 1995 ) proposed to compare the number count @xmath44 and/or @xmath45 in a lensed and an unlensed field to measure @xmath40 .",
    "depending on the value of the slope @xmath46 of the number count in the reference field , we observe a bias ( more objects ) or an anti - bias ( less objects ) in the lensed field .",
    "the particular value @xmath47 corresponds to the case where the magnification of faint objects is exactly compensated by the dilution of the number count ( eq.(18 ) ) .",
    "this method was applied on the cluster a1689 ( broadhurst , 1995 ) , but the signal to noise of the detection remains 5 times lower than with the distortion method for a given number of galaxies .",
    "the magnification may also be determined by the changes of the image sizes at fixed surface brightness ( bartelmann & narayan 1995 ) .",
    "the difficulty with these methods is that they required to measure the shape , size and magnitude of very faint objects up to b=28 which depends on the detection threshold , the convolution mask and the local statistical properties of the noise .",
    "these remarks led us to propose a new method to analyze the weak lensing effects , based on the auto - correlation function of the pixels in ccd images , which avoids shape parameter measurements of individual galaxies ( van waerbeke et al .",
    "it is described in the next subsection .",
    "the ccd image is viewed as a density field rather than an image containing delimited objects .",
    "the surface brightness , @xmath48 , in the image plane in the direction @xmath49 is related to the surface brightness in the source plane @xmath50 by the relation , i()=i^(s)(a ) , which can be straightforwardly extended to the auto - correlation function ( acf ) ( e.g. the two - point autocorrelation function of the light distribution in a given area ) , ( ) = ^(s)(a )  .",
    "this equation is more meaningful when it is written in the weak lensing regime , ( ) = ^(s)()-  _ ^(s ) ( ) [ 1-a ] since the local acf , @xmath51 , now writes as the sum of an isotropic unlensed term , @xmath52 , an isotropic lens term which depends on @xmath14 , and an anisotropic term which depends on @xmath53 .",
    "let us now explore the gravitational lensing information that can be extracted from the shape matrix @xmath54 of the acf , _",
    "ij=^2  ( )  _ i",
    "_ j^2  ( )  . the shape matrix in the image plane is simply related to the shape matrix in the source plane @xmath55 by @xmath56 . if the galaxies are isotropically distributed in the source plane , @xmath57 is isotropic , and in that case @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the identity matrix . using the expression of the amplification matrix",
    "@xmath13 we get the general form for @xmath54 , = m(a+|g|^2)(1-)^2(1-|g|^2 )  .",
    "the observable quantities ( distortion @xmath60 and magnification @xmath40 ) are given in terms of the components of the shape matrix , _",
    "1=m_11-m_22(m )  ;  _ 2=2m_12(m )  ;  = , where @xmath61 is the trace of @xmath54 and @xmath62 is the determinant of @xmath54 . as for sheared galaxies",
    ", we see that the distortion is available from a direct measurement in the image plane while the magnification measurement requires to know the value of @xmath30 which is related to the light distribution in the source plane , or in an unlensed reference plane .",
    "the acf provides a new and independent way to measure @xmath60 and @xmath40 which does not require shape , size or photometry of individual galaxies .",
    "furthermore , the signal to noise ratio is proportional to the number density of background galaxies , @xmath63 , instead as @xmath64 for the standard method ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "a description of its practical implementation and first results are given in van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 1996a ) and van waerbeke & mellier ( 1996b ) .",
    "clearly , the acf is the most powerful technique for measuring the orientation of very weak shear as the one we expect from large - scale structures .",
    "the direct observation of the mass distribution on scale larger than 10 ( or @xmath65 1 square degree ) is one of the great hopes of the weak gravitational lensing approach .",
    "two observational directions are now being investigated . in the first one we search for the shear of dark condensation of mass that can be responsible for the magnification bias of luminous quasars and radio - sources .",
    "it probes the lumpiness of matter distribution within large - scale structures . in the second one",
    ", we analyze the statistical properties of weakly lensed background galaxies on degree scales in order to obtain constraints on the cosmological parameters and on the projected power spectrum .",
    "fugmann ( 1990 ) and bartelmann & schneider ( 1993a , b ) have demonstrated that there is a strong correlation between the presence of galaxies or clusters and bright quasars .",
    "they interpreted this as a magnification bias induced the galaxy over - densities along the line of sight .",
    "however , the measured correlation is too strong to be only due to individual galaxies , so bartelmann & schneider suggested that the magnification bias originates from groups or even rich cluster of galaxies . if this suggestion is correct , the deflector responsible for the magnification bias should also induce gravitational shear onto background sources .    3truecm    bonnet et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , mellier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 1996a ) found a strong gravitational shear and a galaxy excess around the quasar pair q2345 + 007 , the shear pattern being associated with a group or a small cluster . in the same way fort et al .",
    "( 1996a ) have measured the shear around a few over - bright qso - s that could be magnified by nearby lensing mass ( figure 3 ) .",
    "it is the first tentative to detect gravitational structures from a mass density criteria rather than luminosity excess .",
    "the field of view around each qso is small and up to now , there is not enough data to draw a synthetic view of the global matter distribution .",
    "however , both weak lensing detection around bright radio - sources and the correlations found by bartelmann & schneider seem to favor a model where clumps of dark matter are more numerous that expected and concentrated on groups and clusters of galaxies .      in the statistical studies of the shear at very large scale the lenses",
    "are not individually identified , but viewed as a random population affecting the shape of the galaxies with an efficiency depending on their distances . indeed , in this approach , we consider the statistical properties of the shear measured on backgroung objects for randomly chosen line - of - sights .",
    "the measured shears are actually filtered at a given angular scale so that a signal of cosmological interest can be extracted . for a filtering scale of about one degree , the structures responsible of the gravitational shear being at a redshift of about 0.4 are expected to be on scales above 10 , that is in a regime where their properties can be easily predicted with the linear or perturbation theory . within this line of thought , blandford et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , miralda - escud ( 1991 ) and kaiser ( 1992 ) argued that the projected power spectrum should be measurable with such a method provided shape parameters are averaged on the degree scale , as it is illustrated on figure 4 .",
    "2.0 truecm    for such a scale , however , the shear is expected to be as low as 1% .",
    "therefore its detection requires high image quality to avoid uncontrolled errors , and large angular coverage so that it is possible to separate the gravitational shear from the intrinsic galactic ellipticities by averaging over thousands of galaxies .",
    "so far such a detection has not been completed due to these severe constraints , but there are now projects to build very large ccd mosaic camera which could be capable of doing large deep imaging surveys .",
    "the megacam project conducted by the french institutions , cea ( ce in saclay ) and insu , the canadian cnrc and the cfht corporation consists in building a 16k@xmath6616k camera at the prime focus of cfht .",
    "this camera will provide a total field of view of 1@xmath671@xmath68 , with image quality lower than 0.5 \" on the whole field . using a pertubation theory approach , bernardeau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have analyzed the statistical properties of the gravitational shear averaged on megacam scales .",
    "they have shown that with the observation of about 25 such fields , one could recover the projected power spectrum and @xmath0 independently by using the variance and the skewness ( third moment ) of the one - point probability distribution function of the local convergence in the sample . basically , these moments write , ^2 _",
    "p(k )  ^1.5  z_s^1.5 and  ^-0.8  z_s^-1.35 where @xmath69 is the scale where the convergence @xmath14 is averaged , @xmath70 is the projected power spectrum of the dark matter and @xmath71 is the averaged redshift of sources .",
    "note that the skewness , expressed as the ratio of the third moment by the square of the second , does not depend on @xmath70 and provides a direct information on @xmath0 .",
    "these important results show that a very large - scale survey of gravitational shear can provide important cosmological results which could be compared with those coming from large - scale flows and observations of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy spectrum that are expected to culminate with the cobras / samba satellite mission .",
    "however , there are two shortcomings that must be handled carefully : first , it requires detection of very weak shear from shape parameters of galaxies .",
    "thus , the image quality of the survey is a crucial issue . the acf method proposed by van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 1996a ) should provide accurate shape information with a high signal to noise ratio .",
    "it is probably the best available method for measuring shear on very large scales .",
    "the second point is the strong dependence of the variance and the skewness with the redshift of lensed sources . since there are no hopes to obtain redshifts of these galaxies even from spectroscopy with the vlt - s , we face on a difficult and crucial problem .",
    "it may be overcome if multicolor photometric data can provide accurate redshifts for very faint galaxies .",
    "another possible solution could be the analysis of the radial magnification bias of faint distant galaxies around rich clusters which , indeed , probes the redshift distribution of the sources ( fort et al .",
    "1996b and see section 6 ) .",
    "one remarkable property of gravitational lensing effect is the local change of the galaxy number density .",
    "the observable number density of sources results of the competition between deflection effect which tends to enlarge the projected area and the magnification which increases the number of faint sources .",
    "the expected galaxy number density is , n(r ) = n_0(r)^2.5 -1 , where @xmath40 is the magnification at the position @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the slope of the galaxy counts .",
    "when @xmath74 is larger than 0.4 , the galaxy number density increases . at faint limiting magnitude , @xmath74 becomes significantly smaller than 0.4 and a clear galaxy depletion can be detected ( broadhurst 1995 , fort et al .",
    "1996b ) .    .5 truecm    the shape of the depletion curves depends on the magnification @xmath40 which is a complicated function of the lensing potential , the redshift distribution of sources and the cosmology .",
    "for a singular isothermal sphere , the amplification at radius @xmath72 writes , ( r ) = 4 ^2 c^2d_ls d_osr r-1 , and the depletion curve for a single redshift of sources looks like those shown in figure 5 . for a redshift distribution",
    ", the depletion curve shows a plateau between two extremum points corresponding to the lowest and highest redshift of the sources .",
    "once the redshift of one source is known , the radial position of the highest redshift strongly depends on the cosmological constant .",
    "fort et al .",
    "( 1996b ) tentatively measured depletions curves in cl0024 + 1654 ( see figure 6 ) and a370 of faint galaxies close to the noise level . with the hypothesis of a single lens along the line of sight they found that the angular position of the highest - redshift sources is very high and imposes that the most distant galaxies visible in the field have redshifts larger than @xmath75 , while the width of the depleted areas extend as far as 60 arcseconds which is incompatible with a low-@xmath1 universe .",
    "in fact , the observations provide a lower limit @xmath76 ( figure 6 ) .",
    "in the last ten years , the gravitational lensing effects turned out to be among the most promising tools for cosmology .",
    "it is indeed a direct probe of the large - scale cosmic mass distribution and some observable quantities revealed to be extremely sensitive to the cosmological parameters .",
    "we summarize in table 3 what we learned about @xmath0 from the mass distribution in rich clusters of galaxies and what we expect in the near future .",
    "it shows that we can hope for strong and reliable constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the developing observational tools : we are now aiming at a determination of the cosmological parameters within 10% accuracy .",
