    "recent studies have revealed that nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) occur commonly in galaxies of every type ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "these massive and compact star clusters occupying the centres of galaxies are characterized by small effective radii and high central surface brightnesses that help to distinguish them from the surrounding bulge and disk .",
    "several theories have been proposed to explain the origins of nscs , but two in particular have emerged as leading scenarios . the first invokes gas accretion at the centres of galaxies to form stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second postulates successive mergers of globular clusters ( gcs ) that spiral into the galactic centre due to dynamical friction ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several authors have used ( primarily n - body ) simulations to succesfully reproduce some of the observed features of nscs formed via this mechanism , including their effective radii and central velocity dispersions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite recently modeled the effects of dynamical friction on the orbits of gcs within their host galaxies , in conjunction with the underlying dynamical evolution of the infalling clusters , including mass loss ( due to both stellar evolution and tidal stripping ) and tidal disruption .",
    "the model successfully reproduces the observed features of nscs in both late- and early - type galaxies .",
    "whatever the dominant formation scenario for nscs , the evidence suggests that it is an on - going process .",
    "the nuclei of late - type disk galaxies have been shown to be populated by stars spanning a wide range of ages , with some members being as young as a few tens of myrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "many authors have suggested that this is indicative of episodic star formation that has occurred over an extended period of time .",
    "proponents of the gc infall scenario , on the other hand , have argued that the young ages of some of the stars can be accounted for if star clusters spanning a range of ages were accreted . in at least the milky way , most young star clusters are of relatively low - mass in present - day star forming regions . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite found several super star clusters at the centre of henize 2 - 10 , a blue compact dwarf galaxy with an on - going starburst at its centre .",
    "the authors argue that many of these young massive ( @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 ) clusters have very short dynamical friction time - scales , suggesting that this may be a rare snapshot of nuclear star cluster formation ( via the infall of young massive clusters ) around a pre - existing super - massive black hole .",
    "regardless , the evidence suggests that gc infall can not be the whole story in at least some nscs , and that in at least these cases some in situ star formation has occurred .",
    "for example , this was illustrated by @xcite for the nearby disc galaxies ngc 4244 and m33 using both observations and dynamical models of the nscs at their centres .",
    "the authors argue that gas dissipation is required to account for @xmath3 50% of these nscs masses .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate and compare the mean - square velocities of nscs and their host galaxies , which we use as proxies for energy per unit mass in these systems .",
    "traditional observables , including the radial surface brightness and second - order velocity moment profiles , vary on relatively short time - scales due to episodes of matter infall and/or star formation .",
    "meanwhile , the total mass , energy and angular momentum remain approximately conserved .",
    "total energy and angular momentum are decided by the various processes that go into forming nscs and their host galaxies , whereas traditional observables are also affected by any subsequent or secondary evolution that occurs in energy- and angular momentum - space post - formation .",
    "thus , the total energy and angular momentum more directly probe the formation of galaxies and their nuclear star clusters , by offering access to more fundamental properties of the nuclear cluster - galaxy system than traditional observables . however , we caution that our analysis relies on the same observable quantities to calculate mean - square velocities and that we make the additional assumption of virial equilibrium , which introduces some further uncertainty . regardless , as we will illustrate , the comparison is nonetheless instructive .",
    "in particular , there is a priori no reason to expect that the formation and subsequent time evolution of nscs should be coupled to their host galaxies in energy- and angular momentum - space .",
    "if nscs and their hosts form independently , then they should remain independent in energy- and angular momentum - space at the present - day .",
    "our results suggest that nscs _ are _ coupled to their hosts in energy - space .",
    "we subsequently explore the physical processes that could produce such a correlation and , based on this , propose a means of also using total angular momentum to further constrain nsc formation . in section  [ background ] , we describe the requisite theoretical background .",
    "we present the data we use in this paper to calculate the root - mean - square velocities in section  [ data ] , both for early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "our results are presented in section  [ results ] . in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss the significance of our results for different nsc formation scenarios , and conclude in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the necessary theoretical background .",
    "the purpose here is to motivate our choice for calculating mean - square velocities for both the central nscs and their host galaxies . as we will show , the mean - square velocity is a proxy for the energy per unit mass of the system , assuming virial equilibrium .",
    "the evolution in energy- and angular momentum - space is what determines the balance between the total system mass , half - mass radius and root - mean - square velocity ( see equations  [ eqn : rms1 ] and  [ eqn : rms2 ] ) , via the virial theorem .",
    "thus , the total energy and angular momentum , which are initially determined by the various formation processes and are subsequently conserved in time , are fundamental to determining the observed parameters of a self - gravitating system , which are not time - independent .",
    "naively , there is no reason to expect that the formation and subsequent time evolution of nscs in energy- and angular momentum - space should be coupled to their host galaxies .",
    "if nscs and their hosts form independently , then the evolution in energy- and angular momentum - space should proceed independently , first on a crossing time - scale ( virialization ) and then on a relaxation time - scale ( two - body relaxation in energy - space and resonant relaxation in angular momentum - space ; although the two - body relaxation time - scale tends to exceed a hubble time in both nscs and , especially , their host galaxies ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "intriguingly , however , we will show that there is a strong ( nearly ) linear correlation , and in fact a near equality , between the energy per unit mass ( via the mean - square velocity ) of nscs and that of their host galaxies .",
    "we assume virial equilibrium for all nscs and host galaxies .",
    "the scalar virial relation yields 2e @xmath4 -2k @xmath4 w , where e is the total system energy , k is the total kinetic energy and w is the total potential energy .",
    "the kinetic and potential energies are , respectively : @xmath5 and @xmath6 where v@xmath7 and r@xmath8 are the root - mean - square stellar speed and the gravitational radius , respectively , and m is the total stellar mass .",
    "it follows from the virial theorem that the mean - square velocity is given by : @xmath9 where the last ( approximate ) equality holds for many simple stellar systems @xcite , and r@xmath10 is the median radius ( or half - mass radius ) which is related to the gravitational radius via r@xmath10 @xmath0 0.4r@xmath8 . in general ,",
    "the gravitational radius is related to the system half - mass radius via a multiplicative constant that depends on the gravitational potential , or r@xmath11 @xmath12r@xmath10 .",
    "for example , for a spherically symmetric stellar system , we have r@xmath11 2r@xmath10 @xcite . throughout this paper , we assume r@xmath11 2r@xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath13 2 in equation  [ eqn : rms2 ] ) for all nscs as well as for the bodies of all early - type galaxies , and r@xmath11 r@xmath10 ( i.e. @xmath13 1 ) for the bodies of all late - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ( see below ) .",
    "we calculate the mean - square velocities for nscs and their host galaxies using equations  [ eqn : kin ] and equation  [ eqn : pot ] . for the nscs",
    ", we use @xcite : @xmath14 and for the host galaxies we use : @xmath15 where m@xmath16 and m@xmath17 are , respectively , the total stellar ( or baryonic ) mass of the nsc and host galaxy , f@xmath8 is the baryonic mass fraction inside r@xmath17 , and r@xmath16 and r@xmath17 are the effective or projected half - light radii r@xmath10 of the nsc and host galaxy , respectively , which we use as proxies for the 3-d half - mass radii ( see below ) .",
    "these masses and radii are derived from the observations as described in sections  [ early ] and  [ late ] .",
    "we further assume a constant dark matter mass fraction ( but see section  [ results ] for further discussion of this issue and its effects on our results ) inside the effective radius r@xmath10 for all galaxies , corresponding to a baryonic mass fraction f@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "in practice , kinematical data ( i.e. the two terms in equation  [ eqn : alphav ] below , which correspond to the second - order velocity moments projected along the line of sight ) are difficult to obtain . consequently , very few such measurements have been provided in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this is the reason we calculate root - mean - square velocities indirectly from the virial theorem using the total system mass and the half - light or effective radius , as opposed to using the directly measured second - order velocity moments .",
    "how does the root - mean - square velocity calculated from the virial theorem relate to what is actually observed ?",
    "similarly to r@xmath8 , the root - mean - square velocity v@xmath7 is not measured directly , but rather indirectly via the observed second - order velocity moment v@xmath19 @xmath20 , where v and @xmath21 are the observed mean stellar velocity ( i.e. the mean velocity of ordered bulk motion ) and velocity dispersion , respectively . to obtain v@xmath22 from the observed velocity moments projected along the ling - of - sight , we would need to include multiplicative factors , or @xcite : @xmath23 the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 are determined by the gravitational potential and the angle of inclination relative to the line - of - sight .",
    "for example , @xmath26 1 and @xmath27 3 in the case of an isothermal sphere , which is spherically symmetric @xcite . for a non - spherical potential",
    ", however , the angle of inclination must be accounted for when measuring the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in this section , we describe the data used to compile our samples of both early- and late - type galaxies , beginning with the former .",
    "we summarize in appendix  [ appendix ] all nsc galaxy masses and root - mean - square velocities calculated from these data .",
    "this is done in tables  [ table : table2 ] ,  [ table : table3 ] and  [ table : table4 ] for each of the late - type , virgo cluster and coma cluster samples , respectively .      for our analysis of early - type galaxies ,",
    "we use data from the virgo and coma cluster surveys . beginning with the former ,",
    "we use data for 47 nucleated early - type galaxies observed during the _ advanced camera for surveys _ virgo cluster survey ( acsvcs , * ? ? ?",
    "we reject five galaxies from the original sample of @xcite in which the apparent nscs are significantly offset from the galaxy s photocentre and therefore , as discussed by @xcite , may well be globular clusters that only appear to reside close to the nucleus due to a chance projection @xcite .",
    "we also discard four galaxies with extended nuclei @xcite , which are more accurately described as nuclear disks @xcite , from our sample .    in order to obtain estimates for the stellar masses ,",
    "we use the apparent z - band magnitudes , ( g - z ) colors , and half - light radii for both nscs ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and host spheroids ( from * ? ? ?",
    "in order to convert to absolute magnitudes and physical radii , we obtain distances to individual galaxies from @xcite and @xcite wherever possible , and for galaxies not in the catalogue of @xcite we adopt a distance of 16.52 mpc @xcite .",
    "we also need to multiply the respective z - band luminosities by an appropriate mass - to - light ratio .",
    "we use the empirically calibrated mass - to - light ratios provided by @xcite , accounting for the ( g - z ) color of nsc and spheroid , respectively .",
    "we note here that , given the morphological types of the sample galaxies ( e , s0 , de , ds0 , and de , n ) , their stellar spheroids can be expected to be virialized , and to have little or no current star formation activity .",
    "this justifies use of a single ( colour - dependent ) mass - to - light ratio for each galaxy spheroid in order to derive its stellar mass .",
    "approximate error bars for the nsc masses were calculated using the 0.041 mag uncertainty quoted by @xcite .",
    "we also use data for 53 nucleated low - mass early - type galaxies observed during the coma _ advanced camera for surveys _",
    "cluster survey @xcite .",
    "we include all galaxies in the sample designated as possible members or better .",
    "however , we also check our derived scaling relations without including galaxies listed as possible members , since here membership is not certain .",
    "our results turn out to be insensitive to the adopted inclusion criterion . to calculate the nsc and host galaxy masses , we use the corresponding f814w magnitudes . unlike with the virgo cluster sample",
    ", we do not have colour information to calculate empirically - calibrated mass - to - light corrections for the stellar population .",
    "thus , we assume a mass - to - light ratio of 2 for all nscs and host galaxies to correct for the unseen component of the stellar mass distribution . this is a reasonable assumption for at least the coma cluster , since with only a few exceptions , the colour distribution is very narrow @xcite .",
    "for our analysis of late - type galaxies , we compiled a sub - sample of 69 galaxies compiled from the sample of @xcite , for which there are measurements of their petrosian radii in the 10th sdss data release .",
    "these are nearby ( @xmath28 40 mpc ) , mostly low - inclination spirals .",
    "we calculate the total galaxy luminosity and its effective radius using their sdss petrosian measurements following the prescription given in @xcite ( their sections 3.2 and 3.3 , and equations 5 and 6 ) . to obtain masses for these _ nuclear star clusters _ , we use the luminosities measured from the flux within the best - fitting king model of a given concentration index ( as provided in @xcite ) , multiplied by a suitable mass - to - light correction obtained using the @xcite simple stellar population models for solar metallicity and a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "we use the available colour information given by the various combinations of the most reliable and well - calculated filters , namely @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "all available colours are matched to the respective colours of the @xcite models , and then a median mass - to - light ratio is calculated for all colours ( for more details see georgiev et al .",
    "2015 , in preparation ) .",
    "for the _ galaxy _ luminosities and sizes , we use the z - band petrosian magnitudes and petrosian effective radii given in the tenth data release of the sdss database , which correspond approximately to the half - light radii of the galaxies .",
    "the luminosities are converted to masses using the g- and z - band petrosian magnitudes along with the @xcite empirically - calibrated mass - to - light ratio colour - corrections .",
    "the top panels in figures  [ fig : fig1 ] ,  [ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] show the relation between nuclear cluster mass and the mass of its host galaxy for all early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "the dashed lines have slopes of unity and are shifted along the y - axis to approximately coincide with the distribution of data points in each panel .",
    "lines of best - fit are shown for all samples by the solid lines , found by performing weighted least - square fits to the data .",
    "all fit parameters are summarized in table  [ table : table1 ] . in all samples ,",
    "the intrinsic dispersion in the data exceeds the uncertainties on the individual data points .",
    "this is partly because , in some galaxies , the calculated uncertainties are too small to be representative of the true underlying uncertainties in the measurements ( see tables  [ table : table2 ] ,  [ table : table3 ] and  [ table : table4 ] in appendix  [ appendix ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not always have errors for both the masses and radii used in our calculations of the root - mean - square velocities . to account for the artificially small error bars , uncertainties on the fit parameters",
    "are found by adding ( in quadrature ) an additional constant term @xmath33 to the uncertainties on both the nsc and host galaxy masses , and forcing the resulting reduced chi - square of the fit to be unity .",
    "hence , the term @xmath33 is effectively a free parameter in our fits , and is set by the condition @xmath34 1 .",
    "this increases the uncertainties on the fit parameters to more realistically represent the data .",
    "we also divide all galaxy masses by 10@xmath35 m@xmath2 , which is approximately equal to the sample means , in order to minimize the uncertainties on the y - intercepts of our lines of best - fit . for the virgo cluster sample",
    "we find a slope of 1.74 @xmath36 0.28 ( virgo ) , whereas for the coma cluster and late - type samples we find clearly sub - linear slopes of 0.68 @xmath36 0.10 ( coma ) and 0.55 @xmath36 0.08 ( late - types ) .",
    "the y - intercepts are 6.47 @xmath36 0.07 ( late - types ) , 6.17 @xmath36 0.13 ( virgo ) and 7.01 @xmath36 0.06 ( coma ) . for comparison ,",
    "we also perform bootstrapped maximum likelihood non - symmetric error - weighted fits ( without adding an intrisinc dispersion term to the uncertainties on the individual data points ) . in all but the late - type sample , the derived fit parameters are consistent with our previous estimates to within the uncertainties .",
    "the slopes for the late - type , virgo and coma samples are , respectively , 0.55@xmath37 , 1.92@xmath38 and 0.79@xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding instrinsic scatter estimates are , respectively , 0.211@xmath40 , 0.203@xmath41 and 0.193@xmath40 . the intrinsic scatter and its uncertainty",
    "are found following @xcite and based on bayesian probability theory , such that the intrinsic dispersion is invariant to rescalings of the problem .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : table4 ]",
