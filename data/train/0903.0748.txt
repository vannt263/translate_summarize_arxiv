    "quantum information propagation in a cluster is driven by the pattern of measurement bases , regardless of the measurement outcomes .",
    "mbqc is attractive because cluster states are considered to be easy to create on systems ranging from the polarization state of photons @xcite to josephson junction qubits @xcite .",
    "a cluster state can be built on a two - dimensional rectangular lattice with manhattan geometry .",
    "some of the qubits in the cluster state are data qubits , while the rest are created in a generic entangled state . employing quantum correlations for quantum computation ,",
    "quantum gates on the data qubits can be evaluated by measuring lattice qubits in a particular basis .",
    "all gates in the clifford group , including cnot , can be performed in one time step via a large number of concurrent measurements .",
    "remarkably , because both wires and swap gates are in the clifford group , mbqc supports long - distance gates in a single time step even when the cluster state is built on a physical system permitting only nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "the toffoli phase gate , which is not in the clifford group , can be executed in two time steps , where the measurement basis for the second step is selected depending on previous measurement outcomes .",
    "this adaptive process , which must be cascaded through most interesting quantum circuits , determines the overall performance of many algorithms .",

    "the depth of a toffoli gate in mbqc is 2 , and our circuit does not change the original behavior .",
    "in addition to the toffoli - dependent rounds , the qcla requires a small number rounds of cnots and nots , each of which adds one to the circuit depth , giving a total of out - of - place and in - place mbqcla depths are @xmath150 and 2@xmath151 , respectively .",
    "we can optimize the mbqcla spatial resources in several ways .",
    "first , by relaxing the manhattan constraints on the physical geometry , we can use a graph state , which requires fewer communication resources if it can be physically implemented .",
    "the graph state adder will be presented in section [ sec:3ef ] .    in this section ,",
    "we retain the manhattan constraint but optimize the circuit .",
    "the idea of the bent network@xcite , imagining that logical qubits are propagated through traces on a single - layer two - dimensional surface , is used to reduce the horizontal resources of mbqcla .",
    "contrary to the usual quantum circuit assumption that the horizontal axis relates to logical time , in a \" bent  network the temporal axis flows freely in the spatial layout .",
    "the consequence is that a more compact circuit can be constructed .",
    "if we apply this bent network method to mbqcla , we also find that we can reduce the horizontal size of the circuit .",
    "the bent form of vbe is purely rectangular , but mbqcla is not as regular . the horizontal size for every logical qubit position will depend on the number of quantum gates , since it will vary along the register as shown in fig.[motion1x ] .",
    "the illustration of a bent network implementation for @xmath4=10 is given in fig.[optimizedin - placembqc ] .",
    "to optimize the circuit , we take small groups of qubits , or subregisters , and slide them toward the middle of the circuit . as can be seen in fig.[optimizedin - placembqc ] ,",
    "bending the network can reduce the cluster resources required near qubits @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 by the amount :    @xmath160    where _ n _ = number of logical qubits , @xmath161= the number of rounds ( columns ) that @xmath67th - subregister moves , @xmath162= number of logical qubits in the @xmath67th - subregister ( usually 3 , sometimes 4 ) , and @xmath163= width of toffoli phase gate . for @xmath4=10 , this manual optimization of horizontal communication results in a reduction of @xmath2 12 @xmath164 for spatial resources , or @xmath2 3822 qubits .      in the previous sections",
    ", we presented cluster state adders . here , we present a graph state adder .",
    "the gsqcla is simpler and follows more directly from the original qcla definition .",
    "for mbqc in graph states , we assume that the restriction to manhattan physical geometry is lifted , and arbitrary entanglement operations between qubits are allowed .",
    "the vertices follow the graphical notation of mbqc in cluster states but with the three additional types of vertices:@xmath20measured input qubits in an arbitrary angle , @xmath165 , and @xmath166@xmath22 and there are two types of edges : entanglement and input / output information flows .",
    "we choose @xmath54 and @xmath59 for running qcla .",
    "when two gsqc quantum gates are concatenated , the output qubits of one become the input of the other .",
    "the birds eye view of the in - place gsqcla is given in figure [ gsqcla2 ] .",
    "the circuit depth of graph state is identical to that of mbqc , so we focus here on the number of qubits and entanglement operations .",
    "concatenating quantum gates in graph states can reduce the number of qubits whilst the number of entanglement operations is invariant@xcite .",
    "the number of entanglement operations in gsqcla is    @xmath167    where @xmath168 @xmath20toffoli phase , cnot , and not gates@xmath22 , @xmath169 = the number of entanglement operations in type @xmath70 gates , and @xmath170 = the number of gates of type @xmath70 .",
    "the number of qubit resources before the removal of unnecessary measurement is given by eq.[opteqgen ] .",
    "after the adjustment , the qubits resources is    @xmath171    where @xmath108 @xmath20toffoli phase , cnot , and not gates@xmath22 , @xmath172 = number of removed qubits of type @xmath173 circuit and @xmath174 and @xmath175 are the number of removed qubits in @xmath84 , @xmath91 , @xmath94 , and additional rounds in the circuit , respectively .",
    "the formulation of @xmath175 varies depending on the type of circuit .    we know from table ( [ table0a ] ) that qcla requires 10@xmath4 - 3@xmath123 - 3@xmath176 - 3@xmath128 - 3@xmath177 - 7 toffoli phase gates and that the toffoli phase gate uses 39 qubits and 43 entangling operations .",
    "therefore , based on the above formulations , the entanglement operations for the out - of - place gsqcla is @xmath178 the number of qubits for this circuit is @xmath179 or roughly @xmath180 for large @xmath4 .",
    "this formulation is obtained after concatenating the gsqcla quantum gates and adjusting their qubits resources to form the circuit .",
    "similarly , the in - place gsqcla has @xmath181 entanglement operations .",
    "the number of qubits for the in - place gsqcla is @xmath182 about twice the size of the out - of - place version .",
    "figure [ comparisonresources ] plots the resources required for the in - place mbqcla , as derived in equations ( [ optinpl ] ) , ( [ newopt ] ) , and ( [ ipsize ] ) . the red area , which represents the horizontal communication costs of mbqcla , is @xmath2 77 @xmath164 of the qubits in the cluster .",
    "the light green area , showing the costs of mbqcla circuit vertical communication , consumes @xmath2 11 @xmath164 .",
    "the cost of the computational circuit shown by the light blue area is @xmath2 12 @xmath164 of the spatial resources .",
    "the light yellow area represents the qubits resources for the in - place gsqcla which costs @xmath2 9 @xmath3 in spatial resources .",
    "in this work , the circuit designs for several forms of a measurement - based quantum carry - lookahead adder ( mbqcla ) and graph - state quantum carry - lookahead adder ( gsqcla ) are presented .",
    "we have shown the resources required to perform the quantum carry - lookahead adder in cluster state as a function of the number of logical qubits , width of quantum gates , and number of qubits in quantum gates . by bending the network and removing the border between the rounds , the optimization of the in - place mbqcla circuit changes its shape from a rectangle to a diamond - like form .",
    "the proposed evaluation methods for the cost and performance of application circuits for mbqc will be useful for large scale quantum computer architecture , since application circuits for quantum computers will need optimization similar to that done for classical computer technology .",
    "this work has shown the value of finding application algorithms that match the strengths of measurement - based quantum computation .",
