    "there is an extensive theoretical and empirical literature on estimating average causal effects of binary treatments in observational studies based on the assumption of unconfoundedness or ignorable treatment assignment . under this assumption differences in outcomes for units with different treatment levels , but the same values for pre - treatment variables , can be interpreted as estimates of causal effects .",
    "much of the literature builds on the seminal paper by @xcite ( rr83 from here on ) which clarified the central role of the propensity score ( the conditional probability of receiving the treatment given the pre - treatment variables or covariates ) in analyses of causal effects in such settings , and which proposed a number of widely used estimators .",
    "see @xcite for a textbook treatment .",
    "although important for empirical practice , much less theoretical work has been done on the setting with more than two treatment levels ( exceptions include @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . because in settings with multi - level treatments there is no scalar function of the covariates that has all the properties that rr83 presents for the propensity score in the binary treatment case , it has been claimed that there is no natural analogue to matching and subclassification on the propensity score ( @xcite ) . in the main contribution of the current paper",
    "we show that , contrary to these claims , the essence of the results in rr83 generalizes to the setting with multi - level treatments .",
    "in particular , we develop methods for matching and subclassification on scalar functions of the covariates that are valid irrespective of the number of distinct levels for the treatment .",
    "the key insight is that we do not construct sets of units with the balancing property that within these sets the treatment level is independent of the covariates . doing so would require adjusting for the vector of propensity scores with length equal to the number of treatment levels minus one .",
    "instead we focus on estimating the average of the potential outcomes separately for each treatment level , which requires adjusting only for the probability of receiving that particular level of the treatment .",
    "this insight allows us to extend some of the most widely used methods for the binary treatment case to the multi - level treatment case without giving up the dimension reducing property of the propensity score .",
    "we provide some simulation evidence that demonstrates the relevance of concerns with the previously proposed estimators and the promise of the new methods .",
    "following @xcite and rr83 we use the potential outcome set up , generalized to the case with more than two , unordered , levels for the treatment in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the treatment is denoted by @xmath0 . in the standard binary treatment case @xmath1 , the two treatments are often labeled treatment and control . for each unit",
    "@xmath2 there are @xmath3 potential outcomes , one for each treatment level , denoted by @xmath4 , for @xmath5 . implicitly in this notation is the assumption that there is no interference between units and no versions of each treatment level ( the stable - unit - treatment - value assumption , or sutva , @xcite ) . the observed outcome for unit",
    "@xmath2 is the potential outcome corresponding to the treatment received : @xmath6 we also observe a vector - valued covariate or pre - treatment variable , denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "these pre - treatment variables are known a priori not to be affected by the treatment , typically measured prior to the determination of the treatment level , and so there are no multiple versions of these covariates corresponding to the different levels of the treatment",
    ". these pretreatment variables may include fixed attributes of the units , or measurements prior to the treatment assignment that predict the outcome , for example prior health status .",
    "although we do not stress this in the notation , there is implicitly a temporal aspect to the study with three stages : first , the pre - treatment variables are measured , or at least they assume their values prior to the assignment of the treatment ; second , the treatment is assigned or selected ; third , the outcome assumes its value and is measured .",
    "we assume the sequence @xmath8 @xmath9 with the potential outcomes is i.i.d .",
    ", so that the sequence of realized values @xmath10 @xmath11 is also i.i.d .    following the literature ( e.g. , rr83 ) ,",
    "we focus on average treatment effects as the causal estimands .",
    "this is less restrictive than it may appear at first because we can first take transformations of the outcomes and pre - treatment variables . for the comparison between treatment levels @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the average effect is @xmath14.\\ ] ] the expectation is taken with respect to the same population ( called the target population , @xcite ) for different treatment - level pairs @xmath15 .",
    "some researchers , when analyzing data with multi - level treatments , have used conventional methods for comparing two treatment levels at a time .",
    "often such analyses use only information on units exposed to one of those two treatment levels , which would lead to estimates of @xmath16 $ ] .",
    "if the subpopulation of units with treatment levels @xmath12 or @xmath13 is different in terms of potential outcome distributions , these estimands are generally different from the @xmath17 defined in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , because the latter do not condition on @xmath18 . as a result",
    "such binary - comparison analyses make it difficult to compare @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] because they refer to different populations . in this paper",
    "we mainly focus on the case where the different treatment levels are qualitatively distinct . in that cases",
    "the interest is typically in average effects of the form @xmath17 .",
    "in other cases , however , the treatment levels may measure the quantity of a dose .",
    "in such cases the researcher may be interested in weighted combinations of average effects .",
    "for example , one might be interested in @xmath20 , with the weights adding up to one , which would correspond to a weighted average of unit increases in the dose .",
    "one advantage of such estimands is that their variance may be lower than that for particular @xmath17 . in this case there",
    "may also be particular interest in @xmath21 , the effect of the maximum dose .",
    "our results also apply to all such estimands .",
    "our focus is on observational studies where assignment to treatment is not completely random . instead ,",
    "following a large strand of the observational studies literature , we assume that assignment to treatment is unconfounded so that , within subpopulations that are homogenous in observed pre - treatment variables , assignment to treatment is as good as random .",
    "this is strictly weaker than complete randomization by allowing for general associations between the treatment level and the pre - treatment variables .      in this section",
    "we discuss the generalization of the notion of the propensity score , introduced in the causality literature by rr83 for the binary treatment case , to our setting with multi - level treatments . in the binary treatment case rr83",
    "defines the propensity score as the conditional probability of receiving the active treatment rather than the control treatment , @xmath22 .",
    "here we generalize that to the multi - level treatment case , following @xcite :    ( generalized propensity score ) the generalized propensity score is the conditional probability of receiving each treatment level : @xmath23      before formally discussing unconfoundedness assumptions , let us assume that there is overlap in the covariate distributions :    ( overlap ) for all values of @xmath24 the probability of receiving any level of the treatment is positive : @xmath25    without this assumption there will be values of @xmath24 for which we can not estimate the average effect of some treatments relative to others without relying on extrapolation . in section 6",
    "we discuss methods for constructing a subsample with better overlap for cases where this assumption is ( close to ) violated .",
    "we start by generalizing the conventional rr83 version of the unconfoundedness assumption to the case with multi - level treatments .",
    "we refer to this as strong unconfoundedness to distinguish it from the weaker condition of weak unconfoundedness .",
    "( strong unconfoundedness ) the assignment mechanism is strongly unconfounded if @xmath26 [ strong ]    here we use the @xmath27 notation introduced by @xcite to denote ( conditional ) independence .",
    "the assumption of strong unconfoundedness has no testable implications . in a particular application",
    "the assumption is a substantive one , and often a controversial one .",
    "often it can be made more plausible by collecting detailed information at baseline on characteristics of the units that are related to treatment and outcome . as a result",
    "the dimension of @xmath7 may be high .",
    "one implication of strong unconfoundedness is the following extension of the propensity score result in rr83 to the multi - level treatment case :    [ lemma1 ] ( rr83 ) suppose the assignment mechanism is strongly unconfounded . then @xmath28    because @xmath29 , it follows that @xmath30 is a linear combination of @xmath31 , and so we do not need to include @xmath32 in the conditioning set .",
    "if there are two levels of the treatment , the result in the lemma reduces to the result in rr83 . as pointed out in @xcite and @xcite , the dimension reduction property of the lemma",
    "depends on the number of distinct levels for the treatment , and therefore the result is less useful in settings with a substantial number of treatment levels .",
    "the problem is that without additional assumptions there is in general no scalar function @xmath33 of the covariates such that @xmath34 , suggesting that the advantages of the propensity score approach do not carry over to the multi - level treatment case .",
    "@xcite discuss additional assumptions under which functions @xmath35 exist with this property and whose dimension is lower than @xmath36 . in particular , @xcite assume that a scalar balancing function @xmath35 exists and propose a matching estimator based on @xmath35 , and @xcite propose a subclassification estimator under this assumption .",
    "nevertheless , in general such functional form assumptions may be controversial .",
    "we improve the dimension reduction property of the generalized propensity score by weakening the requirement of strong unconfoundedness condition to weak unconfoundedness .",
    "define the @xmath3 indicator variables @xmath37 : @xmath38 in terms of these indicator variables strong unconfoundedness is equivalent to @xmath39 now we can formulate the weak unconfoundedness notion , introduced in @xcite .",
    "( weak unconfoundedness ) the assignment mechanism is weakly unconfounded if for all @xmath40 , @xmath41    although formally it is obviously weaker , we do not wish to argue that weak unconfoundedness is substantively weaker than strong unconfoundedness .",
    "in fact neither have testable implications , and there appear to be no interesting estimands that are identified under the stronger assumption but not under the weaker assumption . rather , the two key insights , and the motivation for distinguishing between the two unconfoundedness assumptions , are , one , that , as shown in lemma [ lemma2 ] below , weak unconfoundedness is preserved if we condition on a scalar function of the pretreatment variables , whereas preserving strong unconfoundedness requires conditioning on a set of @xmath36 functions of the pre - treatment variables , as shown in lemma [ lemma1 ] , and two , that weak unconfoundedness is sufficient for identifying average causal effects , as formalized in lemma [ lemma3 ] below .",
    "[ lemma2 ] ( weak unconfoundedness ) suppose the assignment mechanism is weakly unconfounded .",
    "then for all @xmath40 , @xmath42    [ lemma3 ] ( average causal effects under weak unconfoundedness ) suppose the assignment mechanism is weakly unconfounded .",

    "it is useful to compare it to the standard result under strong unconfoundedness . under the strong unconfoundedness assumption",

    "we do not , and in fact can not , construct such subpopulations .",
    "however , in order to estimate the average effect @xmath48 $ ] it is not necessary to do so .",
    "instead , we construct , for each treatment level @xmath12 separately , subpopulations where we can estimate the average value of the potential outcomes , but only for that single treatment level . for treatment level @xmath12",
    "these subpopulations are defined by the value of a single score , @xmath49 , leading to the equality @xmath50 =     \\mathbb{e}\\bigl [   \\mathbb{e}[y_i^{\\rm obs}\\mid w_i = w , p(w\\mid x_i)]\\bigr].\\ ] ] that difference in focus allows us to reduce the dimension of the conditioning variable to a scalar , irrespective of the number of treatment levels .",
    "in this section we discuss matching methods .",
    "first we discuss conventional matching on the full set of pre - treatment variables .",
    "this is not a new method , but it will be useful to contrast with the proposed methods . then we discuss how the generalized propensity score can be used to develop a new matching estimator that matches only on a scalar function of the pre - treatment variables .",
    "@xcite demonstrates covariate matching in multi - level treatments . here",
    "we focus on nearest neighbor matching .",
    "other modifications include multiple nearest neighbors matching , kernel matching and so forth .",
    "reviews of general matching methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "define the covariate matching function @xmath51 as the index for the unit with treatment level @xmath12 that is closest to @xmath24 in terms of covariates ( ignoring ties ) : @xmath52 here we use @xmath53 to denote a generic metric .",
    "in practice one would typically use the mahalabonis metric , where @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . note that the set of indices we search over includes all units , including unit @xmath2 itself , so that for all @xmath2 , @xmath57 .",
    "given the covariate matching function @xmath58 the potential outcomes for unit @xmath2 are imputed as @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",
    "now we estimate @xmath17 as @xmath61 note that to estimate @xmath17 we impute potential outcomes @xmath62 and @xmath63 even for units who did not receive either treatment level @xmath12 or @xmath13 .",
    "this ensures comparability of average treatment effects for different pairs of treatments .",
    "just as in the binary treatment setting , matching on all covariates is not an attractive procedure in the multi - level treatment setting if the number of covariates is substantial ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in the binary treatment case rr83",
    "proposed matching on the propensity score to reduce the dimensionality of the matching problem . if @xmath64 is the rosenbaum - rubin propensity score , the matching function for the binary treatment case would be @xmath65 one could generalize that to the multi - level treatment case by matching on the full set of scores , leading to @xmath66    here we generalize this to the case with multi - level treatments in a way that allows for a scalar matching variable . in this case",
    "matching is conceptually quite different from matching on covariates .",
    "we separate the estimation of @xmath67-\\mathbb e[y_i(w)]$ ] into the two terms .",
    "first we focus on the problem of estimating @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "define the generalized propensity score matching function as @xmath69 here the treatment level @xmath12 enters into the matching function not only by limiting the set of potential matches to the set of units with @xmath70 , but also in the function of the covariates that is being matched , @xmath71 . in covariate and conventional propensity score matching the treatment level only affects the set of potential matches .",
    "given the generalized propensity score matching function we impute @xmath62 as @xmath72 the average effect is estimated as @xmath73 note that the difference @xmath74 in ( [ drie ] ) is _ not _ generally an estimate of an average causal effect , whereas in ( [ twee ] ) the difference @xmath75 _ is _ an estimate of the average causal effect @xmath76 $ ] . in the binary treatment case",
    "this distinction between covariate and propensity score matching does not matter : in that case there are only two values for @xmath12 , @xmath77 , so that @xmath78 , and therefore matching on @xmath79 is the same as matching on both @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the same as matching on @xmath80 .",
    "in web appendix , we provide mathematical details for inference and show that under mild regularity conditions , the matching estimator based on the generalized propensity score or the estimated generalized propensity score is asymptotically normally distributed .",
    "in the binary treatment literature , a common alternative to matching is subclassification or stratification on the propensity score , originally proposed by rr83 . to put our proposed methods for the multi - level treatment case in perspective ,",
    "let us briefly summarize their approach for the binary treatment case in our current notation to show why it does not directly extend to the multivalued treatment case . divide the sample into a number of subclasses by the value of the propensity score @xmath64 . based on cochran ( 1968 ) who shows that this removes much of the bias",
    ", researchers often use five subclasses . to be specific ,",
    "let @xmath81 be the @xmath82th quintile of the empirical distribution of @xmath83 , for @xmath84 , and define @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then we construct the five subclasses , based on the propensity score being between @xmath87 and @xmath81 . for subclass @xmath82",
    "one can estimate the average causal effect of treatment @xmath88 versus treatment @xmath89 as @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the number of units in subclass @xmath82 with treatment level @xmath12 . the overall average treatment effect is then estimated by averaging over the subclasses : @xmath92 because all @xmath93 are close to equal , at most differ by @xmath88 , ( assuming there are no ties ) this is essentially a simple arithmetic mean of the @xmath94 estimates @xmath95",
    ".    now consider the multi - level treatment case .",
    "we are interested in @xmath17 for some pair of treatment levels @xmath12 and @xmath13 . again , and this is a cornerstone of our approach , we write this as a difference of two expectations , @xmath96- \\mathbb e[y_i(w)]$ ] and separately estimate the two terms @xmath97 $ ] and @xmath98 $ ] . to estimate the second term , @xmath99 $ ]",
    "we construct subclasses or strata based on @xmath100 .",
    "let @xmath101 be the quintiles of @xmath102 in the sample .",
    "then the average value of @xmath62 in subclass @xmath82 is estimated as @xmath103 where @xmath91 is the number of units with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the overall average of @xmath62 is then estimated as @xmath106 = \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^5 \\frac{n_{w}}{n}\\cdot \\hat{\\mu}_{jw}.\\ ] ]    the key is that , in contrast to what is done in the binary treatment case , we do not construct subclasses defined by similar values for the @xmath36 propensity scores such that we can estimate causal effects within the subclasses .",
    "instead we construct subclasses defined by similar values for a single propensity score at a particular treatment level so that we can estimate the average potential outcome for that treatment level within the subclasses , and we do so separately for each treatment level , with different subclasses for each treatment level . in the binary treatment case",
    "this amounts to the same thing because the two propensity scores @xmath64 and @xmath107 are linearly related , but in the multi - level case these two approaches are different .",
    "we focus on assessing balance in the covariate distributions in terms of the propensity score as well as directly in terms of the covariates , following the discussion in @xcite for the binary case . for each treatment level @xmath12",
    ", we calculate the average values for each component of the covariate vectors and their corresponding sample variances : @xmath108 define also for each treatment level the average value of the covariates for units with a treatment level different from @xmath12 and the average variance : @xmath109 respectively . the first approach to assessing",
    "the covariate balance is to inspect the normalized differences for each covariate and each treatment level : @xmath110 we can also assess balance by looking at the generalized propensity score . for each treatment level we can calculate the normalized difference for the generalized propensity score for that treatment level : @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "finally , one may wish to plot a histogram of @xmath102 for the @xmath114 units for @xmath105 and a histogram of @xmath102 for the @xmath115 units with @xmath116 in the same figure .      in many applications",
    "there are regions of the covariate space with low values for the probability of receiving one of the treatments .",
    "this is likely in the setting with a binary treatment , but even more likely to be an issue in settings with many treatment levels . of note , lack of overlap affects the credibility of all methods attempting to estimate all pairwise average causal effects from the common population",
    "in that case we may wish to modify the estimands to average only over the part of the covariate space with all treatment probabilities away from zero .",
    "the question is how to choose the set of covariates with overlap . for the binary treatment case",
    ", @xcite proposed a method for improving overlap by trimming the sample .",
    "specifically they suggest dropping units from the analysis with low and high values of the propensity score .",
    "the threshold for dropping units is based on minimizing the variance of the estimated average treatment effect on the trimmed sample . by trimming the sample",
    ", this method generally alters the estimand to the so - called feasible estimand , by changing the reference population . using the feasible estimand",
    "is widely recommended in the literature , as long as we are careful to characterize the resulting quantity of interest .",

    "in this section we assess the performance of the two new estimators in cases of multi - level treatments ( matching on the generalized propensity score , gpsm , and subclassification on the generalized propensity score , gpss ) in a monte carlo study relative to five previously proposed estimators , first the simple difference in average outcomes ( dif ) by treatment status , second pairwise propensity score matching ( ppsm ) that compares two treatment levels at a time using the binary propensity score matching on the units exposed to one of those two treatment levels , third the estimator based on matching on the set of @xmath36 propensity score set ( pssm ) , fourth the estimator based on weighting , and fifth , matching on all covariates ( cov ) . in the binary treatment and missing data case previous simulations",

    "<S> in this paper , we develop new methods for estimating average treatment effects in observational studies , in settings with more than two treatment levels , assuming unconfoundedness given pre - treatment variables . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize propensity score subclassification and matching methods which have been among the most popular methods in the binary treatment literature . whereas the literature has suggested that these particular propensity - based methods do not naturally extend to the multi - level treatment case , we show , using the concept of weak unconfoundedness and the notion of the generalized propensity score , that adjusting for a scalar function of the pre - treatment variables removes all biases associated with observed pre - treatment variables . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the proposed methods to an analysis of the effect of treatments for fibromyalgia . </S>",
    "<S> we also carry out a simulation study to assess the finite sample performance of the methods relative to previously proposed methods .    </S>",
