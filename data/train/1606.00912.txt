    "then via the identification @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 the spin-1/2 operator ) the hamiltonian ( [ hsimp ] ) maps onto the spin-1/2 hamiltonian @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 is the total staggered magnetization of the square lattice and thus the order parameter for nel ( i.e. antiferromagnetic ) long - range order of the spin system .",

    "indeed , for the chosen parameters these densities ( as well as all other fractional densities @xmath147 not shown in the plot ) allow for the buildup of a bragg structure ( the corresponding bragg - ordered region decreases as @xmath148 increases since for larger densities the onsite interaction makes them energetically unstable ) . in the cdw and for @xmath145 a filled site",

    ", this becomes visible in the sf cluster analysis by the structure of the patterns of mi and sf clusters . in both cases",
    "the different phases are signaled by the appearance or disappearance of an additional component of the structure form factor .",
    "differing from the one dimensional case of ref .",
    "@xcite , thus , the formation of an intracavity field sustains a variety of phases which can exhibit superfluidity .",
    "in addition to the mf study of ref .",
    "@xcite , moreover , the lmf with sf cluster analysis further reveals that the selforganized phase exhibits different orders , such as sg@xmath169 and sg , and also qualitatively different patterns .",
    "the onsite repulsion plays an important role , setting an additional constrain to achieving the bragg order , and can force the system to remain a sg",
    ".    we have further analysed the form of the phase diagram for different incommensurate cases taking @xmath175 .",
    "for @xmath148 odd , the phase diagram present the same phases as for @xmath176 , the main difference is in the fractional densities which constrain the formation of a bg phase . for @xmath148",
    "even we also observe the formation of bg phases at the border of the mi phase , which then become sg at the interface : the system tends to form bragg ordered structured at low densities .",
    "in general , this behaviour shows that the long - range interaction favours the formation of quasi - periodic structures supporting scattering into the cavity mode .",
    "to conclude we have used the local mean field approach with sf cluster analysis to calculate the phase diagrams for the extended bose - hubbard model with cavity mediated long range interactions .",
    "when the cavity wavelength @xmath1 is commensurate with the one of the external periodic potential @xmath0 , the phase diagram is similar to the phase diagram of the extended bose - hubbard model with repulsive nearest neighbour interactions . for @xmath4 ,",
    "in particular , it exhibits mi lobes around half - integer values of the ratio between chemical potential and onsite repulsion , @xmath125 , and incompressible cdw checkerboard lobes around integer values .",
    "each tip of the cdw lobes is covered with a small super - solid ( ss ) region .",
    "we expect the phase diagram to be qualitatively identical in the experimental two - dimensional setup , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and also for higher dimensions ( @xmath177 ) . in one space dimension lmf is a rather crude approximation , but still we expect similar features of the phase diagram to occur @xcite .",
    "in the incommensurate case , for @xmath157 with @xmath178 our lmf calculation combined with a sf cluster analysis @xcite reveals a much richer phase diagram than predicted by conventional mean - field theory @xcite : in addition to mi , sf@xmath169 , and sf phases , we could identify also an isotropic and striped superglass ( sg ) phase , which is characterised by an aperiodic ( glassy ) density modulation and isotropic or striped superfluid ( off - diagonal ) order .",
    "the striped sg regions are characterized by superfluid stripes in @xmath13 direction , implying off - diagonal order ( i.e. , phase coherence ) along these stripes . in an experimental setup , such as the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , one would expect an exponentially small overlap between the wave function of the different stripes leading to extremely small but non - vanishing phase coherence also in the perpendicular direction .",
    "we note that similar striped superfluid phases have also been identified in the extended bose - hubbard model with nearest and next - nearest neighbor repulsion @xcite .",
    "moreover , we expect that sg phase shall also occur in the two - dimensional bose - hubbard model with an aperiodically modulated chemical potential , when the modulation wave vector is only slightly different from the lattice constant .",
    "we finally remark that , even though superior to a conventional mf approach , the lmf method underestimates the effect of quantum fluctuations that can change the critical properties , as is well known in the disordered case @xcite",
    ". therefore it would be desirable to check our predictions for the commensurate as well as for the incommensurate case by means of quantum monte carlo simulations .",
