    "if low - energy supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is realized in nature , the next generation of colliders , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the international linear collider ( ilc ) are likely to copiously produce susy particles and will allow for precise measurements of their properties .",
    "once susy is established experimentally , it is the main task to explore the unknown mechanism of susy breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "the most general way to do so is to reconstruct the parameters of the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite parameter space , which is significantly more ambitious than a test of specific models of susy breaking , like e.  g.  minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite can be tested against the data in a relative straight - forward manner ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) due to their small number of parameters .",
    "the general mssm lagrangian contains more than 100 new parameters which are only related to each other through the unknown ssb mechanism . many of them ( like complex phases ) are already limited to some extent by measurements , e.g. by the absence of neutron and electron electric dipole moments  @xcite .",
    "furthermore universality of first and second generation appears to be a reasonable approximation while large yukawa couplings in the third generation lead to significant differences . applying these constraints ,",
    "the number of free parameters is reduced to 19 , including the standard model top quark mass as a parameter to account for parametric uncertainties .",
    "it is of high interest how well this 19-dimensional parameter space can be restricted with future measurements from lhc and ilc .",
    "the experimental collaborations atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite at the lhc have performed detailed simulations of the possibilities to extract mass information from their future data . at a future electron positron collider for collision energies up to 1  tev , the international linear collider ( ilc ) ,",
    "the kinematically accessible part of the superpartner spectrum can be studied in great detail due to favorable background conditions and the well - known initial state  @xcite .",
    "the attempt of an evaluation of the mssm lagrangian parameters and their associated errors is only useful if the experimental errors of the future measurements are known and under control .",
    "the by far best - studied susy scenario to serve as a basis for such an evaluation is an msugra - inspired benchmark scenario , the sps1a scenario  @xcite . for this scenario with a relatively light superpartner spectrum",
    ", a wealth of experimental simulations exists and has recently been compiled in the framework of the international lhc / ilc study group  @xcite . in this paper , we perform a global fit of the 19 mssm parameters to those expected measurements augmented by possible measurements of topological cross - sections ( i.  e.  cross sections times branching fractions ) that will be possible at the ilc with polarized beams . since a detailed experimental simulation for some measurements is lacking , we estimate their uncertainties conservatively from the predicted cross - sections and transferring experimental efficiency from well - studied cases .    as theoretical basis for the global fit presented in this paper we use the loop - level calculations as implemented into the program spheno  @xcite . in spheno ,",
    "the masses and decay branching fractions of the superpartners are calculated as well as production cross sections in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "in this paper we present the result of a global fit of the mssm lagrangian parameters at the electro - weak scale for a slightly modified sps1a benchmark scenario using the program fittino  @xcite .",
    "previous evaluations of the errors of those parameters  @xcite did not attempt to develop a strategy to extract those parameters from data without _ a priori _ knowledge .",
    "within fittino , special attention is given precisely to this task , i.  e.  to find the parameter set which is most consistent with the data in a @xmath1 minimization before a careful evaluation of errors and correlations is performed .",
    "a similar code  @xcite exploits a different strategy for this task .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fit ] we shortly describe the approach used in fittino . in subsection",
    "[ sec : inputs ] , the input observables are explained .",
    "the results of the fit and the error evaluation method are summarized in subsection  [ sec : results ] and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "from the numerous fitting options provided by fittino we have chosen the following fit procedure to extract the low - energy lagrangian parameters .",
    "first , in order to be independent of human bias , start values for the parameters are calculated using tree - level relations between parameters and a few observables  @xcite . for fits with many parameters",
    "these values are not good enough to allow a fitting tool like minuit  @xcite to find the global minimum due to the amount of loop - level induced cross - dependencies between the individual sectors of the mssm .",
    "therefore , in a second step , the parameters are refined , using a simulated annealing approach  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the parameter values are close to the global minimum so that a global fit using minuit can find the exact minimum in a third step . to determine the parameter uncertainties and correlations many individual fits with input values randomly smeared within their uncertainty range",
    "are carried out .",
    "the parameter uncertainties and the correlation matrix are derived from the spread of the fitted parameter values .",
    "a number of anticipated lhc and ilc measurements serve as input observables to the fit . for the ilc ,",
    "running at center - of - mass energies of 400 gev , 500 gev and 1 tev is considered with 80  % electron and 60  % positron polarization .",
    "the predicted values of the observables are calculated using the following prescriptions :    * * masses : * the experimental uncertainties of the mass measurements are taken from @xcite . * * cross - sections : * only @xmath2 cross - sections are included in the fit . however , the measurement of absolute cross - sections is impossible for many channels , in which only a fraction of the final states can be reconstructed .",
    "therefore , absolute cross - section measurements are only used for the higgs - strahlung production of the light higgs boson , which is studied in detail in  @xcite . * * cross - sections times branching fractions : * since no comprehensive study of the precision of cross - section times branching fraction measurements is available , the uncertainty is assumed to be the error of a counting experiment with the following assumptions : * * the selection efficiency amounts to 50  % . * * 80  % polarization of the electron beam and 60  % polarization of the positron can be achieved . * * 500  fb@xmath3 per center - of - mass energy and polarization is collected . * * the relative precision is not allowed to be better than 1  % and the absolute accuracy is at most 0.1  fb to account for systematic uncertainties .",
    "+ all production processes and decays of susy particles and higgs bosons are used which have a cross - section times branching ratio value of more than 1  fb in one of the @xmath2 polarization states ll , rr , lr , rl at @xmath4 and @xmath5  gev and lr or rl at @xmath6  gev . * * branching fractions : * the three largest branching fractions of the lightest higgs boson are included .",
    "the uncertainties on the higgs branching fractions are taken from  @xcite . * * standard model parameters : * the present uncertainties for @xmath7 and @xmath8 are used as conservative estimates . the experimental uncertainty for the top mass @xmath9 is assumed to be 50 mev  @xcite .",

    "the top mass @xmath9 is fitted , since it strongly influences parts of the mssm observables .",
    "thus 19 lagrangian parameters are simultaneously determined in this fit .    as shown in table  [ tab : unsmearedfitresultsps1aprime ] all parameters are perfectly reconstructed at their input values . due to the fact that the input observables are unsmeared in this fit , the final @xmath1 is close to zero at @xmath28 .",
    "most parameters are reconstructed to a precision better than or around 1  % . for the u(1 ) gaugino mass parameter @xmath24 , an accurary below the per mil level is achieved for the fit including experimental uncertainties only .",
    "however , its precision is worse by a factor of 2 once theoretical uncertainties are included .",
    "the uncertainties on other parameters increase by up to a factor of 5 if theoretical uncertainties are taken into account , such as @xmath17 . in order to fully benefit from the precision data provided in particular by the ilc",
    ", work must be invested to reduce uncertainties of theoretical predications .    after a successful convergence of the simulated annealing algorithm to the input parameter values ,",
    "the fit uncertainties are evaluated by carrying out many individual fits with input values randomly smeared within their uncertainty range using a gaussian probability density .",
    "the complete covariance matrix and the correlation matrix are derived from the spread of the fitted parameter values . for the fit without theoretical uncertainties 1002",

    "for each of those fits , the parameter set is minimized . for a large and complex parameter space with large correlations among the parameters",
    "this method has turned out to be more robust than a minos error analysis .",
    "an example of the outcome of this procedure for the fit ( with experimental uncertainties only ) is shown in figure  [ pulldistributions ] for the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath24 for the 1002 independent fits .",
    "figure  [ chisqdistribution ] shows the distribution of the @xmath1 values for these 1002 independent fits for the case without theoretical uncertainties .",
    "the mean @xmath1 obtained from a fit of the @xmath1 distribution to the observed distribution is 124.6 , in agreement with the expectation of 126  @xmath29  0.64 .",
    "this shows that the fits converge well to the true minimum of the @xmath1 surface for the smeared observables , implying that the uncertainties extracted from the toy fit value distributions are correct .      in order to determine automatically the most important input observables influencing the precision with which a certain parameter , the contribution of each observable to @xmath30 is calculated for the parameter of interest .",

    "it shows that the small contribution of the squark mass parameter @xmath50 to the slepton mass @xmath51 has a larger effect compared to the good precision of the measurement of @xmath51 , than the large contribution of the squark mass parameter to the much less precisely measured squark mass .      in order to test the dependence of the fit results on the synergy of lhc and ilc ,",
    "a fit has been performed with all ilc - influenced observables removed . while the lhc observables may allow to determine a further reduced set of parameters ( e.g. msugra , if a simplified model described by fewer parameters still fits the data ) , the complete set of parameters studied here is not constrained by the lhc mass observables which currently enter the fit .",
    "for most parameters , the resulting parameter uncertainties exceed the lhc+ilc uncertainties by orders of magnitude . only for 3 of the parameters studied here , namely @xmath52 , @xmath45 and @xmath26 , the uncertainty is in the same order of magnitude .",
    "this exemplifies the synergy effects of the lhc and the ilc .",
    "the lagrangian parameters of the mssm assuming universality for the first and second generation and real parameters but without assumptions on the susy breaking mechanism are correctly reconstructed without usage of _ a priori _ information .",
