    "the goals of quark flavor physics are : to test the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) description of quark mixing and cp violation , to search for evidence of new physics , and to sort between new physics scenarios initially uncovered at the lhc .",
    "this will require a range of measurements in the quark flavor changing sector of the sm at the per cent level .",
    "these measurements will come from a variety of experiments including babar and belle and their upgrades , full exploitation of the facilities at fermilab ( cdf / d0/btev ) and at the lhc ( cms / atlas / lhc - b ) , and experiments in rare kaon decays .    however , the window to new physics that quark flavor physics can provide , has a curtain drawn across it .",
    "the curtain represents hadronic uncertainty .",
    "the study of weak interaction phenomena , and the extraction of quark mixing matrix parameters remain limited by our capacity to deal with non - perturbative strong interaction dynamics .",
    "techniques such as lattice qcd ( lqcd ) directly address strongly coupled theories and have the potential to eventually determine our progress in many areas of particle physics .",
    "recent advances in lqcd have produced a wide variety of calculations of non - perturbative quantities with accuracies in the 10 - 20% level for systems involving one or two heavy quark such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarkonia .",
    "the techniques needed to reduce uncertainties to 1 - 2% precision exist , but the path to higher precision is hampered by the absence of accurate charm data against which to test and calibrate the new theoretical techniques .    to meet this challenge the cleo collaboration has proposed to operate cleo and cesr as a charm and qcd factory at charm threshold where the experimental conditions are optimal . in a three year focused program cleo - c will obtain charm data samples one to two orders of magnitide larger than any previous experiment operating in this energy range , and with a detector that is significantly more powerful than any previous detector to operate at charm threshold . cleo - c has the potential to provide a unique and crucial validation of lqcd with accuracies of 1 - 2% .    if lqcd is validated , cleo - c data will lead to a dramatic improvement in our knowledge of the quark couplings in the charm sector .",
    "in addition cleo - c validation of lattice calculations , combined with b factory , tevatron , and lhc data will allow a significant improvement in our knowledge of quark couplings in the beauty sector .",
    "the impact cleo - c will have on our knowledge of the ckm matrix makes the experiment an essential step in the quest to understand the origin of cp violation and quark mixing .",
    "cleo - c allows quark flavor physics to reach its full potential , by enabling the heavy flavor community to draw back the curtain of hadronic uncertainty , and thereby see clearly through the window to the new physics that lies beyond the sm . of equal importance",
    ", cleo - c allows us to significantly advance our understanding and control over strongly - coupled , non - perturbatyive quantum field theories in general .",
    "an understanding of strongly coupled theories will be a crucial element in helping to interpret new phenomena at the high energy frontier .",
    "for many years , the cleo experiment at the cornell electron storage ring , cesr , operating on the @xmath3(4s ) resonance , has provided most of the world s information about the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons . at the same time ,",
    "cleo , using the copious continuum pair production at the @xmath3(4s ) resonance has been a leader in the study of charm and @xmath6 physics .",
    "now that the asymmetric b factories have achieved high luminosity , cleo is uniquely positioned to advance the knowledge of quark flavor physics by carrying out several measurements near charm threshold , at center of mass energies in the 3.5 - 5.0 gev region .",
    "these measurements address crucial topics which benefit from the high luminosity and experimental constraints which exist near threshold but have not been carried out at existing charm factories because the luminosity has been too low , or have been carried out previously with meager statistics .",
    "they include :    1 .",
    "charm decay constants @xmath7 2 .",
    "charm absolute branching fractions 3 .",
    "semileptonic decay form factors 4",
    ".   direct determination of @xmath8 & @xmath9 5 .",
    "qcd studies including : + charmonium and bottomonium spectroscopy + glueball and exotic searches + measurement of r between 3 and 5 gev , via scans + measurement of r between 1 and 3 gev , via isr 6 .",
    "search for new physics via charm mixing , cp violation and rare decays 7 .",
    "@xmath6 decay physics    the cleo detector can carry out this program with only minimal modifications .",
    "the cleo - c project is described at length in @xcite - @xcite . a very modest upgrade to the storage ring",
    "is required to achieve the required luminosity .",
    "below , we summarize the advantages of running at charm threshold , the minor modifications required to optimize the detector , examples of key analyses , a description of the proposed run plan , and a summary of the physics impact of the program .",
    "i would like to thank my cleo colleagues for providing the opportunity to represent the collaboration at this conference .",
