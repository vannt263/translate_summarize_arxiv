    "still , the formation of a first gap - opening planet close to the snow line @xcite could pave the way for the formation of a second - generation planet at the outer edge of the first planet s gap @xcite .",
    "provided that the second planet opens a gap , its outer edge could also trigger the formation of a third - generation planet .",
    "subsequent planet formation could proceed as a sequence , as long as there are enough planetesimals and gas left .",
    "the tidal interaction between a planet and its nascent protoplanetary disc alters the planet s semi - major axis , causing its orbital migration @xcite . assuming the central object is a sun - like star , a planet typically more massive than saturn opens a gap around its orbit and generally migrates inwards .",
    "it is thus unlikely that a massive planet formed through the core - accretion scenario within @xmath4 au of its host star could migrate to a separation as large as 100 au .",
    "a notable exception was proposed by @xcite , who showed that the tidal interaction between a pair of resonant massive planets embedded in a common gap , and their protoplanetary disc , could drive both planets to orbital separations much larger than that of their birth place , providing some specific conditions on the planets mass ratio and on the disc s turbulent viscosity .",
    "another in - situ formation scenario is based on the gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it involves early - stage protoplanetary discs , which are massive enough for its self - gravity to play a part in its evolution .",
    "the probability that discs form fragments is described by two dimensionless parameters .",

    "@xmath9 approximately equals the angular frequency @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite showed that , for an infinitesimally thin disc to fragment , @xmath11 .",
    "the second parameter describing the stability of a self - gravitating disc is the disc s cooling timescale in units of the orbital timescale , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the cooling timescale and @xmath14 the disc s thermal energy density @xcite . the critical value of the cooling parameter @xmath15 , below which fragmentation will occur if @xmath16 , depends on the disc s adiabatic index @xcite , and on the local disc to primary mass ratio @xcite .",

    ", we examine the orbital evolution of a single planet embedded in its nascent gravitoturbulent disc , following the assumption that the planet has formed by gravitational instability .",
    "we show that the planet migrates inwards in a timescale very similar to that of type i migration @xcite in the absence of turbulence .",
    "our physical and numerical models are described in section  [ sec : model ] . in section  [ sec : results ] , we present our results of simulations . conclusions and future directions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we investigate the tidal interaction between a massive planet and the protoplanetary disc it formed in through the gravitational instability scenario .",
    "once a gaseous clump has formed by fragmentation , it contracts until @xmath19 dissociation occurs , causing a rapid collapse of the clump down to planetary sizes .",
    "our study does not address the formation of the planet , and we consider the clump and the planet as one object . in the following ,",
    "our system of interest ( clump and planet ) is referred to as the planet .",

    "as described below , our approach is to first set up a steady state gravitoturbulent disc , then include a single planet and follow its orbital migration .",
    "the disc s properties after fragmentation are poorly constrained .",
    "they depend on how many clumps form , and how massive they are . in our study , we assume that the disc properties ( density , temperature ) are virtually unchanged by the fragmentation stage . in particular , we assume that the disc remains gravitoturbulent .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the findings of previous numerical studies on disc fragmentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the images of the discs show similar structures after the formation of a clump .",

    "providing angular momentum transport driven by gravitoturbulence occurs locally , which is not necessarily the case @xcite , the alpha parameter associated with the angular momentum flux density is given by @xcite @xmath26 which indicates that varying @xmath15 is equivalent to varying the viscous stress in the disc .",
    "preliminary calculations with our fiducial setup ( initial profiles and grid s resolution are described below ) showed that the critical value of @xmath15 below which fragmentation occurs ranges from 10 to 15 . since we require the disc to be in a gravitoturbulent state , but we do not require further fragmentation so as to focus on the migration of a single planet , we simulated three disc models with @xmath27 , 20 and 30 .",
    "each of our three models initially comprises a @xmath28 2d disc around a star of fixed mass @xmath29 , and spanning a radial range @xmath30 au .",

    "we describe in this section the results of our three disc models with cooling parameters @xmath48 , 20 and 30 .",
    "the absence of heating source initially leads to decrease the disc s temperature , and thus the toomre q - parameter , until gravitoturbulence sets in . as both the initial q - profile and @xmath15",
    "are taken to be uniform ( the cooling timescale thus scales proportional to the orbital timescale ) , gravitoturbulence progressively develops through the disc , starting from the inner edge .",
    "after a few orbits at the disc s outer edge , a thermal quasi - equilibrium is reached over the whole disc , where cooling is approximately balanced by shock heating due to gravitoturbulence .    the disc s initial surface density that we assume does not correspond to a mechanical equilibrium with the gravitoturbulent stress .",
    "the disc therefore adjusts both its surface density and temperature profiles to satisfy a mechanical equilibrium along with a uniform toomre - q profile .",

    "the planets gravitational potential is softened over a smoothing length @xmath79 , with @xmath80 the planet s orbital separation , and it takes its maximum value at the restart time ( we do not gradually ramp up the planet s mass ) .",
    "we will show in section  [ sec : numerics ] that our results are not altered by a more gentle introduction of the planet s potential in the disc over a dynamical timescale , the typical formation timescale of a clump .",

    "this similarity stresses that the magnitude of the stochastic torque acting on the planet can be similar to that of the disc  planet tidal torque obtained in the absence of turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such turbulent configurations , the migration timescale must be evaluated in a statistical way , by running several simulations . for each planet mass and each value of @xmath15",

    "results are shown for the eight evenly - spaced values of the planet s azimuth @xmath86 at restart ( increases with increasing color s wavelength ) .",
    "the net trend coming out of our results is that , in spite of the stochastic kicks triggered by turbulence , planets migrate inwards very rapidly . averaging over @xmath86 and @xmath15 , the migration timescale ( defined as the time to migrate from 100 au to 20 au , the location of the grid s inner edge ) is typically as short as 3 orbits for the 5 jupiter - mass planet , 6 orbits for the jupiter - mass planet , and about 8 orbits for the saturn - mass planet . in addition , at fixed @xmath15 , the amplitude of stochastic kicks increases with decreasing planet mass , and so does the spread in the migration timescale .",
    "both results may be qualitatively interpreted as follows .",
    "the torque exerted by the disc on the planet may be decomposed as a background tidal torque , plus a stochastic torque due to turbulent fluctuations . in the mass regime that we consider ( @xmath87 ) , the amplitude of the tidal torque should increase with increasing planet mass .",
    "however , like in discs with turbulence driven by the magneto - rotational instability , it is unclear if the value of the tidal torque is similar to that predicted in laminar disc models , in the absence of turbulence @xcite . a detailed comparison with results of laminar disc models will be presented in section  [ sec : laminar ] .",
    "the standard deviation of the stochastic torque s distribution is primarily controlled by @xmath59 , and therefore by the cooling parameter @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "[ alpha_gammie ] ) . for a given @xmath15 , the smaller the planet mass , the smaller the tidal torque to stochastic torque ratio , the more sensitive the planet is to stochastic kicks , and therefore the larger the spread in the migration timescale . in the same vein , at fixed planet mass ,",
    "the spread in the migration timescale should increase with decreasing @xmath15 .",
    "this trend does not clearly show up in fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuth ] , most probably because our minimum and maximum values of @xmath15 only differ by a factor of 2 .",
    "some further insight into the effect of stochastic kicks is given in section  [ sec : kicks ] .",
    "we finally point out that the disc s density and temperature profiles do not significantly decrease over the planets migration timescale ( for the longest simulation with the saturn - mass planet , the disc s mass decreases by at most @xmath88 ) .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : timescale ] show that planets formed by gravitational instability should rapidly migrate inwards . even for the saturn - mass planet ,",
    "whose mass is smaller than the estimated initial clump s mass ( see first paragraph of section  [ sec : migration ] ) , inward migration occurs in typically less than 10 orbits . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuth ] , planet migration in gravitoturbulent discs is not a smooth process .",
    "planets may experience large kicks , either inwards or outwards , depending on the local density perturbations they encounter .",
    "an example of outward kick is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : kicks ] , which displays the gas density obtained for the restart simulation with @xmath63 and the saturn - mass planet that experiences a significant episode of outward migration in the bottom - left panel of fig .",

    "time increases by 0.1 orbital periods at 100 au from left to right . in each panel ,",
    "the planet s location is indicated with a filled black circle .",
    "we first comment that , because the planet s mass is low enough ( @xmath89 ) , the wakes it generates are invisible , their density contrast being much weaker than that of the turbulent perturbations . in the case depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kicks ] , the planet finds itself with an underdense region behind it , and a ( comparatively ) overdense region in front of it .",
    "this density contrast yields a large , positive coorbital corotation torque that is responsible for the vigorous outward kick experienced by the planet .",
    "this kick increases the planet s orbital separation from @xmath90 au to @xmath91 au in only @xmath92 orbital periods at 100 au ( that is , in 200 years ) . similarly",
    ", inward kicks are obtained as the planet experiences a negative coorbital corotation torque induced by an underdense region ahead of it , and a ( comparatively ) overdense region behind it . as is shown for instance in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuth ] , kicks excite planets epicyclic motion , which is rapidly damped as the underlying disc  planet tidal torque takes over .",
    "the stochastic kicks induced by gravitoturbulence are reminiscent of type iii runaway migration .",
    "this migration regime relies on the formation of a coorbital mass deficit in the planet s horseshoe region , which takes the form of an asymmetric density structure behind and in front of the planet @xcite . in massive ( @xmath93 ) laminar discs with moderate viscosity",
    "( @xmath94 is a few @xmath95 ) , runaway migration is particularly relevant for planets with @xmath96 @xcite , like the planets considered in our study .",
    "however , in our model , the disc s turbulent viscosity ( @xmath59 is a few percent ) is too large to allow planets to open a partial dip around their orbit before they reach the disc s inner edge .",
    "thus , planets do not build up a coorbital mass deficit .",
    "but , through the density fluctuations it triggers , gravitoturbulence may provide an _ effective _ mass deficit on each side of the planet , and induce an effective type iii migration . however , this effective mass deficit is not coorbital with the planet ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : kicks ] ) , and therefore can not lead to a runaway .",
    "consequently , the relative fast inward migration that we obtain can not be attributed to type iii runaway migration .",
    "also , although the planets we consider are massive , their short formation and migration timescales compared to their gap - opening timescale suggests they are subject to type i - like migration instead of type ii , perturbed by stochastic kicks .",
    "this point will be clarified in section  [ sec : laminar ] .",
    "stochastic kicks provide a source of very fast relative motion between the planet and the disc .",
    "[ fig : migrate ] displays the migration speed in units of the local sound speed for the three runs with @xmath63 , and zero azimuth at restart .",
    "the migration rate can be a significant fraction of the local sound speed , and short episodes of supersonic motion are even obtained .",
    "we note that the maximum value for the migration speed to sound speed ratio tends to increase with decreasing planet mass , as less massive planets are more sensitive to stochastic kicks .",
    "time variation of the ( absolute value of the ) migration speed , in units of the local sound speed , obtained for the restart simulations with @xmath81 and zero azimuth at restart .",
    "they correspond to the results shown with black curves in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuth ] .",
    "the migration speed is measured as the time derivative of the planet s orbital separation . ]",
    "our results of simulations indicate that the migration of planets embedded in gravitoturbulent discs is driven by both a vigorous ( negative ) tidal torque , and a ( positive or negative ) stochastic torque . as the planet mass increases , the former prevails over the latter .",

    "we note that the migration timescales of the saturn- and jupiter - mass planets differ by a factor approximately equal to their mass ratio , as expected in the type i migration regime , wherein the tidal torque encompasses the differential lindblad torque and the horseshoe drag @xcite .",

    "the 5 jupiter - mass planet ( @xmath109 ) is , however , more prone to non - linear effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is presumably why the migration timescales of the jupiter- and the 5 jupiter - mass planets do not differ by a factor of their mass ratio .",
    "it may seem surprising that the 5 jupiter - mass planet does not open a gap and migrates in a very short timescale .",

    "( [ gapcriterion ] ) typically ranges from 2 to 4 in the disc inner parts ) , we stress that the vigorous tidal torque exerted by the disc , which is partly due to the large masses of the disc and the planet , conspires to make the planet migrate in a timescale shorter than the timescale required to open a gap ( a few libration timescales , which would correspond here to a few tens of orbits ) . in other words",

    "the total torque comprises the differential lindblad torque and the horseshoe drag . despite the large value of @xmath94 in our disc model ,",
    "the horseshoe drag is found to be fully unsaturated , as the diffusion timescale across the planet s horseshoe region remains larger than the u - turn timescale @xcite .",

    "this is shorter than what we find ( see solid curves in fig .  [",

    "( [ eqhs ] ) shows that , in discs with a uniform toomre - q parameter , the horseshoe drag is negative whenever the surface density profile is shallower than @xmath132 , assuming @xmath38 .",

    "the estimate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : taui ] ) applies to planets with @xmath96 , and is approximate , since it is based on the torque expression for a planet on a fixed orbit .",
    "as we have already stressed above , the fast relative motion between the disc and planet is likely to affect this estimate .",
    "nevertheless , it indicates that the type i migration of planets formed by fragmentation ( @xmath140 ) in discs with moderate aspect ratio ( @xmath141 ) should typically occur in a few tens of orbits at 100 au , that is a few @xmath2 years .         still , the migration timescales in our gravitoturbulent simulations are a factor of a few shorter than obtained in laminar disc models .",
    "in addition to the stochastic kicks due to turbulence , the following two mechanisms may account for the larger migration rates in the gravitoturbulent disc model :    1 .",
    "the non - axisymmetric component of the disc s self - gravity shifts lindblad resonances towards the planet s orbital radius @xcite . for discs close to marginal stability , and for our softening parameter ( @xmath142 )",
    ", this shift increases the differential lindblad torque by typically a factor of 2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 10 ) .",
    "note however that this mechanism has been investigated in laminar disc models .",
    "it is therefore not straightforward whether it should behave identically with turbulence .",
    "still , numerical simulations indicate that , on average , the lindblad torque behaves similarly in laminar and turbulent disc models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where wave - like turbulence is generated by stochastic forcing of the disc ) .",
    "2 .   in fully self - gravitating discs , the effective mass that dictates the strength of the tidal torque and thus the migration rate not only includes the planet mass , but also the mass of the gas surrounding the planet s location . for massive planets ( @xmath143 ) ,",
    "the latter corresponds to the planet s circumplanetary disc , which is a fraction of the planet s hill sphere @xcite .",
    "it is unclear what it corresponds to for smaller planets ; we speculate that it might be the planet s bondi sphere . for illustration purposes , the time evolution of the mass inside the planet s hill radius",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mcpd ] for three gravitoturbulent runs with @xmath63 .",
    "it is comparable to , albeit somewhat larger than the planet mass .",
    "it progressively grows as the planet moves inwards , despite the decrease in the planet s hill radius with decreasing orbital separation .",
    "it is possible that the short cooling timescales used in our simple cooling prescription ( a few dynamical timescales , depending on @xmath15 ) implies that the gas in the planet s hill radius can contract more rapidly than it would do with a more realistic cooling function .",
    "again , notwithstanding the uncertain dynamical role of the planet s hill sphere in turbulent disc models , it is likely that the increased effective mass is responsible for an increase in the migration rate by a factor of a few compared to laminar calculations ( which only include the axisymmetric component of the disc s self - gravity ) .",
    "we comment that both the increase in the effective planet mass , and the decrease in the disc aspect ratio with radius ( in discs with flat temperature profile , @xmath144 ) , make planets less and less sensitive to stochastic kicks as they migrate inwards .",
    "this explains why in fig .",
    "[ fig : kicks ] the amplitude of the stochastic kicks decreases with decreasing orbital separation .",
    "this also implies that , if a planet undergoes a vigorous inward kick , it will be increasingly harder to reverse the trend .",
    "however , should a planet experience a large outward kick , it would take longer for the tidal torque to take over and lead to inward migration again .",
    "we briefly assess in this section the impact of numerics on our results of gravitoturbulent calculations .",
    "we have performed an additional suite of simulations with the jupiter - mass planet and @xmath63 , with the planet s mass first smoothly ramped up over one orbit , while the planet is held on a keplerian orbit .",
    "after this , the planet is released in the disc .",
    "this procedure is meant to mimic the clump formation , which typically occurs over a dynamical timescale , much shorter than the gap - opening timescale ( see section  [ sec : laminar ] ) .",
    "the time evolution of the planet s orbital separation is depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : numerics ] .",
    "it shows the very same trend as obtained without smoothly increasing the planet s mass ( see the mid - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : azimuth ] ) .    to assess the influence of resolution on our simulation results , we have varied the grid s resolution , and the softening length @xmath45 over which the self - gravitating acceleration is smoothed .",
    "we have run two additional disc models with @xmath63 , one with an increased grid resolution ( @xmath145 ) , and one with a larger @xmath45 ( @xmath146 ) . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath45 is 0.3 times the initial pressure scale height , and it can be regarded as a crude treatment for the effects of the disc s finite thickness .",
    "the value of @xmath45 at @xmath147 equals the softening length of the planet s gravitational potential .",
    "we have checked that before the introduction of the planet at 30 orbits the disc properties ( density and temperature profiles ) in both additional models are in close agreement with those of the corresponding run at our fiducial resolution and softening length value .",
    "we restarted these simulations with a jupiter - mass planet .",
    "again , in each case , a series of eight simulations was performed with evenly - spaced values for the planet s azimuth at restart .",
    "results with increased grid resolution , and increased @xmath45 are depicted in the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : numerics ] , respectively .",
    "overall , the amplitude of the stochastic fluctuations is somewhat larger in the high - resolution simulations . still , except in one run that features a rather long episode of outward migration , the migration timescale of the high - resolution simulations ranges from about 3 to 9 orbits , which is broadly consistent with the results at our fiducial resolution .",
    "furthermore , increasing @xmath45 from @xmath148 to @xmath146 does not significantly change the amplitude of the stochastic kicks experienced by the planet , and the migration timescales obtained with both values of @xmath45 are in reasonable agreement .",
    "the results of both additional disc models indicate that the planet s orbital evolution is essentially unaltered by density structures arising from gravitoturbulence with typical size @xmath149 .           as shown in section  [ sec : migration ] , the migration of planets formed by gravitational instability results from a competition between the background disc ",
    "planet tidal torque , and the stochastic torque due to turbulence .",
    "at least in the early stages of their evolution , such planets should have a planet - to - primary mass ratio @xmath150 , and be subject to type i - like migration ( see section  [ sec : laminar ] ) .",
    "as far as the tidal torque is concerned , eq .",
    "( [ eq : taui ] ) shows that the migration timescale is essentially controlled by three dimensionless parameters : @xmath151 , which should be @xmath152 in the early stages of the planet evolution , @xmath153 , which is @xmath154 in a steady state , and @xmath72 .",
    "the disc model that we have considered so far has @xmath155 , which leads to rapidly formed jupiter - mass planets .",
    "however , it is possible that the disc initially has a lower aspect ratio , thereby forming less massive planets .",
    "the latter may still become jupiter - sized objects if mass growth is efficient .",
    "to evaluate the impact of a lower disc temperature on our results , we restarted the simulation of section  [ sec : gts ] with @xmath48 at @xmath156 orbits . at this time",
    ", the disc aspect ratio at the planet s restart location ( 100 au ) has decreased from 0.1 to about 0.06 , and the disc s mass from @xmath157 to @xmath158 .",
    "we choose again three planet masses corresponding to a planet - to - primary ratio @xmath159 around @xmath75 : a 20 earth - mass planet ( @xmath160 ) , a @xmath103 saturn - mass planet ( @xmath161 ) , and a jupiter - mass planet ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "as previously , we take eight evenly - spaced planet s azimuths at restart . the time evolution of the planets orbital separation is shown in fig .  [ fig : lower ] .    compared to the results with @xmath163 , planets with the same @xmath151",
    "are now more sensitive to stochastic fluctuations , the tidal torque becoming less vigorous .",
    "this can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : taui ] ) , which indicates that at fixed values of @xmath151 and @xmath153 , the migration timescale due to the tidal torque scales with @xmath164 .",
    "the mean migration timescales that we obtain for @xmath165 ( about 6 , 12 , and 50 orbits with decreasing @xmath151 ) are typically a factor of 3 - 5 longer than in the corresponding runs with @xmath155 , which is roughly consistent with the aforementioned scaling @xmath166 .",
    "planets observed at large orbital separation from their host star ( typically @xmath167 au ) are thought to be potential candidates for the formation scenario based on the gravitational instability of massive discs .",
    "a number of studies have shown that the formation of clumps by fragmentation is possible at such separations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "clumps are often observed to migrate inwards on short timescales , although in some disc models the formation of several clumps and/or the use of different cooling functions has a significant impact on migration , which sometimes appears to be suppressed @xcite .    in this paper , we have studied the interaction between a single planet and the gravitoturbulent disc it is embedded in , following the assumption that the planet has formed by gravitational instability .",
    "we have performed 2d hydrodynamical simulations with a simplified prescription for the disc s cooling .",
    "three disc models with different cooling timescales have been considered , giving rise to different levels of gravitoturbulence . after having set up a quasi - steady state gravitoturbulent disc ,",
    "we have restarted our simulations including a single planet with a range of masses approximately equal to the expected initial mass of clumps formed by fragmentation ( @xmath168 , with @xmath39 the disc aspect ratio at the fragmenting location ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we find that a planet interacting with its nascent gravitoturbulent disc migrates inwards on very short timescales , despite the stochastic kicks due to turbulent density fluctuations . in a disc with aspect ratio @xmath1 , it takes less than 10 orbits at 100 au ( that is , about @xmath2 years ) for a jupiter - mass planet to migrate from 100 au to 20 au ( the inner edge of our computational grid ) .",
    "planets less massive than the expected fragmenting mass are more sensitive to stochastic kicks , but also migrate inwards relatively fast .",
    "their formation and migration timescales being shorter than their gap - opening timescale ( partly because of the disc s vigorous turbulence ) , planets formed by fragmentation do not open a dip or a gap around their orbit , and are therefore not subject to the type ii and runaway type iii migration regimes .",
    "turbulent density fluctuations may provide an effective mass deficit in the planet s horseshoe region that kicks the planet either inwards or outwards ( see section  [ sec : kicks ] ) .",
    "these kicks can be seen as an effective , _ temporary _ type iii migration coming on top of the inward migration due to the background disc ",
    "planet tidal torque .",
    "the comparison of our results with those of laminar disc models shows that the averaged tidal torque driving the net inward migration in gravitoturbulent discs is essentially the one that would lead to type i migration in the absence of turbulence ( see section  [ sec : laminar ] ) .",
    "part of the reason as to why planets rapidly migrate inwards in our model is due to the set up of a positive entropy gradient in a steady state , which yields a large negative horseshoe drag , adding up to the negative differential lindblad torque .",
    "we argue that in gravitoturbulent discs with uniform toomre - q profiles and cooling - to - orbital timescale ratios ( that is , with a uniform alpha parameter ) , the horseshoe drag should be negative , unless the surface density decreases very steeply ( see eq .",
    "[ eqhs ] ) .",
    "although this possibility can not be excluded , we believe that fast inward migration should be a generic expectation for planets formed by gravitational instability .",
    "the main conclusion of this present study is that a single planet formed by gravitational instability should migrate inwards on a timescale much shorter than the expected lifetime of protoplanetary discs .",
    "however , it is not possible at this stage to say that massive planets at large separation from their host star , such as the hr 8799 system , _ could not _ have formed by gravitational instability .",
    "the simulations presented here contain a number of simplifications that need to be addressed .",
    "we have considered a simplified cooling prescription , causing the entire disc to be gravitoturbulent . in reality",
    ", we would expect the inner parts of a disc to be too hot to be gravitationally unstable , and other sources of turbulence such as the magnetorotational instability could prevail ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* who studied the radial dependence of the alpha viscosity parameter in self - gravitating discs with realistic cooling ) .",
    "it is thus possible that the rapid type i migration of planets formed by gravitational instability gets slowed down in the disc inner parts , resulting in gap formation .",
    "a more realistic cooling prescription will also impact the rate at which planets can contract , with various outcomes for the evolution of the planet mass over its orbital migration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "also , we have focused on the orbital evolution of a single planet assumed to have formed by fragmentation , whereas the formation of multiple clumps is a likely outcome of gravitational instability .",
    "it is fully expected that the interaction between clumps may significantly impact their migration .",
    "we will address these issues in future work .",
    "when mass is confined to a razor - thin disc , the calculation of the alpha parameters associated with the reynolds and gravitational stresses may be inferred from the general three - dimensional case by substituting the volume mass density @xmath169 with @xmath170 , where @xmath8 is the surface mass density of the razor - thin disc , @xmath171 is dirac s delta function , and @xmath172 denotes the vertical coordinate .",
