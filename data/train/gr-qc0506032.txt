    "the need for a strict definition of radial velocity  was treated at the general assembly of the international astronomical union ( iau ) , held in 2000 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , due to the ambiguity of the classic concepts in general relativity . as result",
    ", they obtained three different concepts of _ radial velocity _ : _ kinematic _ ( which corresponds most closely to the line - of - sight component of space velocity ) , _ astrometric _ ( which can be derived from astrometric observations ) and _ spectroscopic _ ( also called _ barycentric _ , which can be derived from spectroscopic measurements ) .",
    "the kinematic and astrometric radial velocities were defined using a particular reference system , called barycentric celestial reference system ( bcrs ) .",
    "the bcrs is suitable for accurate modelling of motions and events within the solar system , but it has not into account the effects produced by gravitational fields outside the solar system , since it describes an asymptotically flat metric at large distances from the sun .",
    "moreover , from a more theoretical point of view , these concepts can not be defined in an arbitrary space - time since they are not intrinsic , i.e. they only have sense in the framework of the bcrs .",
    "so , in this work we are going to define them intrinsically .",
    "in fact , we obtain in a natural way four intrinsic definitions of relative velocity ( and consequently , radial velocity ) of one observer @xmath0 with respect to another observer @xmath1 , following the original ideas of the iau .",
    "this paper has two big parts :    * the first one is formed by sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , where all the concepts are defined , trying to make the paper as self - contained as possible . in section [ sec3 ] , we define the _ kinematic _ and _ fermi _ relative velocities in the framework of spacelike simultaneity ( also called fermi simultaneity ) , obtaining some general properties and interpretations .",
    "the kinematic relative velocity generalizes the usual concept of relative velocity when the two observers @xmath2 , @xmath0 are at the same event . on the other hand",
    ", the fermi relative velocity does not generalize this concept , but it is physically interpreted as the variation of the _ relative position _ of @xmath0 with respect to @xmath1 along the world line of @xmath1 .",
    "analogously , in section [ sec4 ] , we define and study the _ spectroscopic _ and _ astrometric _ relative velocities in the framework of observed ( lightlike ) simultaneity . * in the second one ( sections [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] ) we give some relations between these concepts in special and general relativity . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we find general expressions , in special relativity , for the relation between kinematic and fermi relative velocities , and between spectroscopic and astrometric relative velocities .",
    "finally , in section [ sec6 ] we show some fundamental examples in schwarzschild and robertson - walker space - times .",
    "we work in a 4-dimensional lorentzian space - time manifold @xmath3 , with @xmath4 and @xmath5 the levi - civita connection , using the landau - lifshitz spacelike convention ( llsc ) .",
    "we suppose that @xmath6 is a convex normal neighborhood @xcite .",
    "thus , given two events @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath6 , there exists a unique geodesic joining @xmath7 and @xmath8 and there are not caustics .",
    "the parallel transport from @xmath7 to @xmath8 along this geodesic will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "if @xmath10 is a curve with @xmath11 a real interval , we will identify @xmath1 with the image @xmath12 ( that is a subset in @xmath6 ) , in order to simplify the notation .",
    "if @xmath13 is a vector , then @xmath14 denotes the orthogonal space of @xmath13 .",
    "the projection of a vector @xmath15 onto @xmath14 is the projection parallel to @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath16 is a spacelike vector , then @xmath17 denotes the modulus of @xmath16 .",
    "given a pair of vectors @xmath18 , we use @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath21 is a vector field , @xmath22 will denote the unique vector of @xmath21 in @xmath23 .    in general",
    ", we will say that a timelike world line @xmath1 is an _",
    "observer_. nevertheless , we will say that a future - pointing timelike unit vector @xmath13 in @xmath23 is an _ observer at @xmath7 _ , identifying it with its 4-velocity .",
    "the relative velocity of an observer with respect to another observer is completelly well defined only when these observers are at the same event : given two observers @xmath13 and @xmath24 at the same event @xmath7 , there exists a unique vector @xmath25 and a unique positive real number @xmath26 such that @xmath27 as consequences , we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "moreover , we will define another two concepts of relative velocity ( _ fermi _ and _ astrometric _ ) that do not extend ( [ relvel ] ) in general , but they have clear physical sense as the variation of the _ relative position_.    a _ light ray _ is given by a lightlike geodesic @xmath32 and a future - pointing lightlike vector field @xmath33 defined in @xmath32 , tangent to @xmath32 and parallelly transported along @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath34 ) , called _ frequency vector field of _ @xmath32 .",
    "given @xmath35 and @xmath13 an observer at @xmath7 , there exists a unique vector @xmath36 and a unique positive real number @xmath37 such that @xmath38 as consequences , we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",

    "the spacelike simultaneity was introduced by e. fermi ( see @xcite ) , and it was used to define the _ fermi coordinates_. so , some concepts given in this section are very related to the work of fermi , as the _ fermi surfaces _ , the _ fermi derivative _ or the _ fermi distance_. the original fermi paper and most of the modern discussions of this notion ( see @xcite , @xcite ) use a coordinate language ( fermi coordinates ) . on the other hand , in the present work we use a coordinate - free notation that allows us to get a better understanding of the basic concepts of the fermi work , studying them from an intrinsic point of view and , in the next section , extending them to the framework of lightlike simultaneity .",
