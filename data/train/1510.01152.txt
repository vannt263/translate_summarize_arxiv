    "recently there has been an increasing interest in the study of record statistics , since this field has found several applications in natural sciences , in particular in finance .",
    "if the discrete time series @xmath3 is considered , then we say that a record event happens at time @xmath0 , if @xmath4 is larger than all the previous values in the series .",
    "there are several variables with interesting behaviour such as the time up to which a record survives , the age of the longest lasting record , or the probability that a record event occurs at any given time .",
    "a remarkable feature of record statistics is their universal behaviour , i.e.  they do not depend on the details of the jump distribution as long as it is continuous and symmetric @xcite .",
    "all these results have their roots in the sparre andersen theorem @xcite .    the statistics of the longest lasting record after @xmath2 steps were examined in @xcite in the case of random walks with arbitrary symmetric and continuous distribution of the jumps .",
    "it was observed that the statistics of the records is sensitive to the exact definition of the length of the last record event .",
    "three different natural ways were given to define the length of the last record up to time @xmath2 , and the universal behaviour of the longest lasting record was described in each case .",
    "the asymptotic proportion of the expected value of the longest lasting record was computed .",
    "the constant that appeared in one of the cases was known from the study of fractional brownian motion @xcite .",
    "the present paper is an extension of the work presented in @xcite .",
    "we consider the full sequence of the @xmath0th longest lasting records for @xmath1 and by introducing new constants , we describe their average asymptotic proportions and the limit of the probability that the record of the @xmath0th longest age is broken at step @xmath2 for each @xmath0 as @xmath5 .",
    "some of these constants appeared before in @xcite and in @xcite where the probability that the last excursion is the @xmath0th longest lasting one in a standard brownian motion was computed .",
    "these results were later extended for renewal processes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we examine the limiting distribution of the ages of the records as @xmath5 .",
    "we show that in one of the cases after rescaling by the total length , the ranked sequence of the ages of records converges to the poisson  dirichlet distribution @xcite .",
    "this distribution is related to the ranked lengths of excursions in diffusion processes @xcite and to renewal processes @xcite .",
    "the poisson  dirichlet distribution with parameter @xmath6 was proved to be the limiting distribution of ranked excursion lengths up to time @xmath2 of the simple symmetric random walk @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "s : results ] , we state our main result on the asymptotic behaviour of the laplace transforms of two types of quantities : the average proportions of the ages of the longest lasting records and the probabilities that the record of the @xmath0th longest age is broken at step @xmath2 . in two of the three cases , we can turn these asymptotics into a proof of convergence of the average proportions by specific arguments .",
    "then we deduce the limit theorem about the rescaled ranked sequence of ages from the results of @xcite .",

    "we consider the random walk @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath8 .",

    "further , let @xmath27 denote the probability that the last element of @xmath24 is the @xmath0th longest one of the sequence . in particular , @xmath28    on the example of figure  [ fig : rw ] , the sequence of the ages of records in the three cases are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    ", the distribution of the ages of records does not depend on the step distribution of the random walk as long as the latter is continuous and symmetric .",
