    "the dynamical time evolution of the fission process from an initially formed compound nucleus with a more or less compact shape to the saddle and scission configurations and the simultaneous emission during this deformation process of light particles constitutes a very complex problem .",
    "it is the aim of our study to describe this process taking into account the excitation of both thermal and rotational nature , the initial configuration and to calculate the evaporation of light particles from an excited , rotating , deformed nucleus on its way from the initial compact shape to the scission point .    in the absence of a complete microscopic ab initio theory of such a dynamical process ,",
    "many different theoretical approaches aiming at its description have been worked out @xcite-@xcite .",
    "they generally rely on a classical description of the evolution of the collective coordinates which are introduced as abundant variables . in these descriptions ,",
    "collective parameters appear ( collective mass , friction , and diffusion coefficients ) which depend on the collective coordinates .",
    "it seems clear that the quality of the theoretical description will depend on the more or less pertinent choice of the collective coordinates and the degree of realism of the underlying theory used to determine the collective parameter functions .",
    "the importance of pure quantum effects such as pairing correlations and the existence of shell effects which are present at low excitation energies has been investigated recently @xcite-@xcite .    the multiplicity and",
    "the characteristics ( energies , angular distributions , correlation functions ) of prefission light particles and gamma emission may provide some useful information on the time evolution of the nucleus as it evolves towards the saddle and scission point .",
    "observables like prefission light - particle multiplicities may , indeed , work as a clock .",
    "angular distributions and particle correlations may give informations on the surface and deformation of the fissioning nucleus .",
    "we recently developed a realistic time dependent model which described the time evolution of an excited nucleus as it is e.g. generated in a heavy - ion collision and decaying through symmetric fission with pre- and post - fission light particle emission @xcite .",
    "we applied our description to the case of @xmath3yb and made a detailed analysis of different physical quantities characterizing the decaying system .",
    "we found a rather good agreement of our theoretical predictions with the experimentally observed light - particle multiplicities .",
    "more recently , several new sets of experimental data have become available @xcite-@xcite with a more complete analysis of the emitted light particles .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to systematically test our approach by a comparison with these experimental data .",
    "the fact that these data are obtained in quite different regions of the periodic table makes a comparison between calculated and experimental results all the more challenging .",
    "a particular motivation for this work is the explicit description of the entrance channel through which the initial spin distribution of the system is generated .",
    "this is achieved by considering all possible relative orientations of the two colliding deformed nuclei in the entrance channel .",
    "their different orientations and the different possible impact parameters of the reaction yield the initial spin distribution @xmath4 versus @xmath5 which determines the relative weights of the initial angular momentum of the compound nucleus with which the langevin trajectories are started .",
    "still another motivation for the present work is the presentation of the link between the well known weisskopf formula @xcite and a new and more microscopically founded description of the emission width for the light particles in terms of phase - space densities of the particle to be emitted @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the dynamical model describing the time evolution of a deformed , hot , and rotating nucleus from its initial to a final configuration is presented in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we specify how to determine the emission rates for light particles from a hot , deformed and rotating nucleus moving along the previously described trajectory . in section 4",
    "we show how we obtain the initial spin distribution which has been not considered in our previous study @xcite .",
    "our results concerning the nuclear systems @xmath1ba , @xmath2pt and @xmath6110 are presented in section 5 .",
    "the paper is closed in section 6 with a summary of the most relevant results and an outlook on planned extensions of the model .",
    "we consider an ensemble of deformed nuclei with finite excitation energies and rotational angular momenta as given by the initial conditions determined from the entrance channel .",
    "the subsequent time evolution of the nucleus is governed in our present description by a single collective coordinate @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance between the two centers of mass of the left - right symmetric deformed nucleus and @xmath9 is the radius of the corresponding spherical nucleus having the same volume .",
    "this collective variable is defined in the framework of a trentalange  koonin  sierk ( tks ) @xcite parameterization of the surface of the nucleus .",
    "the tks deformation parameters are related to @xmath10 by means of a minimization procedure of the collective potential energy defined below @xcite .",
    "denoting the conjugate momentum by @xmath11 we use the following classical equations of motion to describe the time evolution of the fissioning nucleus @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the collective mass determined in the incompressible fluid approximation @xcite and @xmath14 the friction coefficient calculated in the wall - and - window friction model @xcite .",
    "the collective potential v(q ) is obtained as the difference of the helmholtz free energy at deformation @xmath10 minus the one for the ground - state deformation .",
    "the free energy could in principle be obtained from a microscopic mean - field calculation at finite temperature .",
    "to perform such a constraint hartree - fock calculation using a reasonable effective nucleon - nucleon interaction of the skyrme or gogny type at every point in the multidimensional deformation space is , of course , completely out of question due to the tremendous computer time such an analysis would involve . even to perform",
    "the same kind of calculation on the level of a selfconsistent semiclassical approximation like the extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) method @xcite at finite temperature @xcite , which would describe the average nuclear structure without shell oscillations , would be far too time consuming .",
    "this is why we have rather used a still simpler semiclassical approach and the liquid drop model with the parametrization of myers and swiatecki @xcite as explained in appendix a. we have tested the barrier heights obtained in this way versus the ones obtained from selfconsistent semiclassical calculations ( at zero temperature ) and obtained agreement within a few mev as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "these calculations describe , of course , deformation properties of non excited nuclei . in order to take nuclear excitation into account",
    "we have used the temperature dependence of the ldm parameters associated with the skyrme skm@xmath15 interaction @xcite , determined for that interaction through selfconsistent semiclassical calculations at finite temperature in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to use the temperature dependence of the ldm parameters associated with the skyrme skm@xmath15 force together with the myers - swiatecki parametrization of the ldm is , of course , inconsistent . since approaches give very similar results for the semiclassical energy at zero temperature this approximation seems , however , very reasonable .",
    "the semiclassical approach used here is of course only an approximation at low temperatures since shell effects are absent from our description .",
    "it is however well known that nuclear shell effects are washed out with increasing nuclear temperature and have essentially disappeared beyond t@xmath16 2.5 - 3 mev . at these temperatures",
    "the semiclasssical results are becoming exact .",
    "for the cold systems the fission barriers obtained with this potential are higher that those evaluated by sierk @xcite , but already at excitation energies @xmath17 mev both barriers become comparable and for @xmath18 mev the barriers evaluated in our model are even smaller than the yukawa folded ones of sierk .    the friction term and the langevin force @xmath19 in eq .",

    ", one would have to treat each ensemble of nuclei with a given initial angular momentum @xmath5 and a given initial excitation energy microcanonically .",

    "this simplifying assumption is innocuous as far as the of observables are concerned , but it may falsify the fluctuations to a certain extent .",
    "we assume that the time scale which governs the fission dynamics is much larger than the internal equilibration time , otherwise the definition of a nuclear temperature would make no sense . under these conditions",
    "the system can be considered as being continuously close to equilibrium .",

    "we take into account the possible emission of light particles in every time step and we make sure that the average total energy of the system will be conserved .",
    "this determines the nuclear excitation energy and hence the temperature at each instant of time .",

    "@xcite we do not repeat it here .      in order to integrate the classical equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we need to fix the initial conditions from which the compound system starts and evolves either through a fission channel to its saddle and scission point or stays as a compound system which only emits light particles , i.e. ends up as an evaporation residue .",
    "all the experimental systems which are considered in the next section are generated by means of heavy ion collisions at some bombarding energy .",
    "the nuclei which are involved in the reaction process can be deformed .",

    "the compound nucleus @xmath1ba has been experimentally produced through two different entrance channels :    ( i )   @xmath110  at   @xmath111=204 , 187 , and 166  mev + and    ( ii )   @xmath112  at   @xmath111=148 and 128  mev .",
    "1 shows the fusion cross - section and the fission yields as a function of the initial angular momentum .",
    "the distributions of the initial angular momentum were calculated with the help of the corresponding langevin equation @xcite for two different entrance channels ( i , ii ) and various bombarding energies .",
    "as it can be seen , the fission yields are rather small and located in the tails of the distributions .",
    "this observation which also holds for many other systems implies that it is of great importance to calculate carefully the dependence of the fusion cross - section on the angular momentum if one wants to describe the competition between the decay of the compound nucleus by fission and by light particle emission in a correct way .",
    "concerning fig .  1 we also note that the dominant part of the initial excitation energy resides in the collective rotational motion .",
    "one observes in fig .",
    "1 a general increase of the fission cross section with the excitation energy of the compound nucleus @xmath1ba with the only exception of the highest excitation energy . in that case",
    "the emission of @xmath38-particles becomes important and competes with the fission process .",
    "this causes a substantial loss of internal energy due to particle emission which in turn leads to an increase of the fission barrier and therefore to a smaller fission yield .    in fig .  2",
    ", the potential energy @xmath113 of the fissioning nucleus @xmath1ba for different angular momenta is plotted as a function of the relative distance between fission fragments .",
    "one can see in fig .  2 that the fission barrier of the fused nucleus at temperature @xmath23=1.6 mev and angular @xmath5=0 is quite high in our model .",
    "it is equal to 43  mev .",
    "it vanishes at very large angular momentum ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the high temperature can also reduce significantly the fission barrier as one can learn from fig .  3 , where the free energy of @xmath1ba is plotted for a few temperatures between 0 and 4.8 mev .",
    "this is why one can observe a significant fission rate only at large angular momenta and high excitation energies .",
    "all curves representing the fission barriers in figs . 2 and 3 end at the scission point region .",
    "it is seen from figs . 2 and 3 that the saddle and scission points are close to each other for @xmath1ba .",
    "part of the excitation energy of @xmath1ba is contained in the rotational mode . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the temperature of @xmath1ba corresponding to different excitation energies is plotted as a function of angular momentum .",
    "one can see that , at the lowest excitation energy @xmath11584 mev and the highest angular momentum , the temperature is 0.5  mev only .",
    "this means that our theoretical predictions based on the statistical equilibrium could be too rough in this case .",
    "the experimental neutron multiplicities obtained for both the fission and the fusion channel are shown in table 1 along with the calculated neutron , proton , and @xmath38-particle multiplicities .    in figs .  5 and  6",
    ", we show the calculated average numbers of neutrons , protons , and @xmath38-particles emitted in coincidence with fission as a function of the excitation energy @xmath33 of the initial compound nucleus .",
    "the initial compound nucleus @xmath1ba is produced by the fusion reaction ( i ) in fig .  5 , and in fig .  6",
    "the same initial compound nucleus originates from the fusion reaction ( ii ) .",
    "only the @xmath70-emission on the way to fission has been measured so far .",
    "the measured numbers of prefission neutrons are indicated by points with error bars . at two excitation energies we have measurements for the two different entrance channels . as one can read from table 1 at the excitation energy @xmath33 = 101.4  mev the measured and calculated numbers of emitted prefission neutrons ( in coincidence with fission ) are @xmath116 = 1.32 and 1.83 , resp . , for the entrance channel ( i ) ( fig .",
    "5 ) and @xmath116 = 1.31 and 1.80 , resp . , for the entrance channel ii ( fig .",

    "the measured and calculated numbers of emitted neutrons are @xmath117 and 1.71 for the entrance channel ( i ) ( fig .  5 ) and @xmath118 and 1.99 for the entrance channel ( ii ) ( fig .  6 ) .",
    "the experimentally observed number of emitted prefission neutrons at given excitation energy @xmath33 of the initial compound nucleus is thus larger for the entrance channel ( i ) than for the entrance channel ( ii ) and the difference of the number of emitted neutrons is seen to be larger for the larger excitation energy .",
    "the interpretation of this observation is that for @xmath1ba only the compound nuclei formed with high angular momentum may undergo fission and thus give rise to prefission neutrons because the fission barrier for low angular momentum is high ( @xmath119 15  mev ) . for @xmath23=1.6",
    "mev the ld fission barriers vanish for about @xmath120 as can be seen from fig .",
    "thus the main part of the prefission neutrons is obtained for angular momenta around @xmath121 as indicated in fig .",
    "1 . at given excitation energy @xmath33",
    "the number of compound nuclei formed with such high angular momentum is larger for the entrance channel ( i ) with @xmath122si as a projectile than for the entrance channel ( ii ) with @xmath123f as a projectile ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    the theoretically estimated prefission proton multiplicities ( @xmath124 ) are very small as one can see in figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "the multiplicities of @xmath38-particles are not negligible at the highest ( @xmath33=131.7 mev ) and the lowest ( @xmath33=84.1 mev ) excitation energies ( see figs . 5 and 6 ) .",
    "the increase of @xmath125 at high excitation energy is mostly due to the high temperature effects while the unexpectedly large number of emitted @xmath38-particles at @xmath33=84.1 mev is mostly due to the large deformation of the emitter and the huge centrifugal potential ( @xmath126 ) reducing the already small coulomb barrier for the @xmath38-particles at the tips even further .",
    "as for the comparison of measured and calculated numbers of emitted prefission neutrons , the general agreement is not unsatisfactory . nevertheless , one notices that the calculated average emission numbers are larger than the observed ones for the higher excitation energy @xmath33 = 118,5  mev .",
    "if , instead of the temperature - independent friction , which underlies these calculations , we would use a friction parameter increasing with temperature , the agreement might be better .",
    "as seen in table  1 , the compound nucleus @xmath2pt was produced at two excitation energies @xmath33=100  mev and 66.5  mev using two different reactions @xcite    * @xmath127  at   @xmath111= 203 and 160 mev , * @xmath128  at   @xmath111= 138 mev .    the theoretical estimates of the initial spin distributions ( solid lines ) as well as the fission rates ( bars ) for @xmath33=100 mev and two entrance channels as well as for @xmath33=66.5 mev are plotted in fig .  7 as functions of angular momentum of the compound nucleus .",
    "it is seen that each reaction leads to different spin distribution .",
    "these differences are responsible for the entrance channel effects in the prefission neutron multiplicities emitted by @xmath2pt at @xmath33=100 mev ( see table 1 ) .",
    "similarly , as in the case of @xmath1ba , we present in fig .",
    "8 the fission barriers of @xmath2pt obtained for different angular momenta ( @xmath5 ) at fixed temperature @xmath23=1.6  mev .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath129  mev and @xmath130 the fission barrier becomes negligible .",
    "also one can see in fig .",
    "9 that with increasing temperature the fission barrier decreases . at @xmath131  mev and @xmath132 ,",
    "the fission barrier of @xmath2pt is about four times lower than for @xmath133 and @xmath132 .",
    "contrary to the case of @xmath1ba , where the saddle point is very close to the scission point , the path from the saddle point ( @xmath134 1.6 ) to the scission point ( @xmath135 2.2 ) of @xmath2pt is much longer and will take more time .",
    "this implies that the case of @xmath2pt is better suited to study the influence of dynamical effects on the prefission light - particle multiplicities .",
    "the prescission neutron multiplicities theoretically predicted for @xmath2pt are too small ( by @xmath1361 unit on the average ) in comparison with the experimental data @xcite .",

    "we only took into account those trajectories for which the saddle point existed , i.e. we neglected the so  called quasifission events . the number of emitted prescission particles is mostly governed by the dynamics from the saddle to the scission point , but of course the initial conditions ( see section 3.1 ) play also an important role . in our model we used two different sets of langevin equations .",
    "the first set of equations describes the fusion dynamics @xcite while the second one , coupled with the master equations for particle emission , describes the fission process @xcite .",
    "a better solution would be a model in which the whole dynamics from fusion to fission as well as the light particles emission would be described by one set of equations .",
    "such an approach could immediately solve the problem of the proper setting of the initial conditions for the compound nucleus .",
    "the experimental and theoretical prefission neutron multiplicities for @xmath151110 compound nuclei are written in table 1 and additionally they are drawn in fig .  12 as functions of the excitation energy of the system .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to the results obtained with the wall - and - window friction ( @xmath152 ) reduced by 50% while the dotted lines stand for the results obtained with the standard value of @xmath152 .",
    "it is seen that for the lowest excitation energies the agreement of theoretical results with the measurements of neutron multiplicities is good , while the discrepancy grows with increasing excitation energy . for the most excited",
    "compound nuclei our theoretical predictions are too large by 1 to 2 units .",
    "this result could mean that the effective time which the system needs to pass from the saddle to the scission point is too long in our model for a very hot compound nucleus .",
    "any of transport coefficients do not depend on the temperature",
    ". this could be the reason of the observed discrepancy . in the near future we intend to perform a new calculation with temperature dependent transport coefficients evaluated within the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the friction parameter could be important , because as one can see in fig .",
    "12 the reduction of the friction parameter by 50% decrease the neutron multiplicities by 1 to 0.5 units depending on the excitation energy of compound nucleus .    in our model",
    "the superheavy nucleus with z=110 is already cold when it reaches the scission point after emission of some neutrons and @xmath38-particles .",
    "so the shell effects begin to play an important role for very deformed shapes .",
    "the shell effects could lead to the compact fission , i.e. splitting of the z=110 nucleus into two spherical fragments . in our model",
    "the shell effects are not present but we simulate partially their influence on the number prefission particles by counting only those particles which have been evaporated before reaching the elongation of nucleus close to the compact scission point ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "contrary to the case of decay of @xmath1ba and @xmath2pt compound nuclei a hot superheavy nucleus with z=110 exists and fissions at very low angular momenta ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "this range of l corresponds to the linear part of the differential fusion cross - section @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "10 ) , so we do not expect entrance channel effects on multiplicities of prefission neutrons .",
    "the coulomb barrier for emission of the charged particles from @xmath151110 isotopes is rather high so the predicted proton and @xmath38 multiplicities are much smaller than the neutron multiplicities as one can see in table  1 .",
    "in the first part of the present work we described an extension of our model @xcite used so far for describing the fission dynamics of an excited , rotating and possibly deformed compound system .",
    "we considered the decay of compound nuclei produced by the fusion of two heavy ions .",
    "the initial spin distribution was determined by a simple model calculation @xcite which took the possible deformation of the two ions into account @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we introduced the microscopic classical expression for the emission rates of light particles derived in reference @xcite and showed the link of this expression with the weisskopf formulation @xcite .    in the second part of the paper we presented a detailed comparison of the calculated neutron multiplicities with the ones obtained in different experiments involving systems from different regions of the mass table .",
    "all five systems discussed in the paper ( @xmath1ba , @xmath2pt and z=110 isotopes ) are good examples of different fission and particle evaporation mechanisms .",
    "the light nucleus @xmath1ba fissions at very high angular momenta ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "its saddle point is close to the scission point , so the fission dynamics plays a rather minor role in this case .",
    "the entrance channel effects influence significantly the decay properties of the excited @xmath1ba , via different initial spin distributions of compound nucleus . also huge centrifugal forces and big deformations corresponding to the saddle point",
    "lead in this case to a true competition between the neutron and @xmath38-particle evaporation .",
    "the experimental prefission neutron multiplicities grow with the excitation energy of @xmath1ba while it is not always the case in our theoretical estimates . in the case of @xmath2pt",
    "the average angular momentum of the fissioning nucleus is around @xmath156 , i.e. @xmath157 less than for @xmath1ba . also the way from the saddle point to the scission point",
    "is longer so that the dynamics from the saddle to the scission plays here an important role .",
    "in addition , the evaporation of a few particles does not increase so dramatically the height of the fission barrier as in the case for @xmath1ba . as a consequence the fission process takes place during a longer time and",
    "the number of evaporated particles is larger .",
    "similarly as in the case of @xmath1ba the initial spin distribution ( the entrance channel effect ) influences the multiplicity of pre - fission neutrons which is here too small ( by @xmath158 30% ) in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "a completely different case is the decay of superheavy compound nuclei with z=110 . here",
    "the way from the weakly deformed saddle point to the scission point is very long .",
    "the fission barrier of a hot compound nucleus with z=110 is very small and it vanishes already at low angular momenta ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "the way in which the z=110 nuclei has been produced does not influence their decay properties since such nuclei exist at small angular momenta only , which belong to the linear part of the fusion cross - section @xmath4 .",
    "a majority of compound nuclei goes to fission with simultaneous emission of neutrons and @xmath38-particles .",
    "the number of prefission neutrons depends in this case on details of the fission dynamics , e.g. the slope of the potential and the magnitude of the friction and diffusion parameters .",
    "our model overestimates slightly ( @xmath160% ) the experimental number of prefission neutrons here .",
    "the neutron emission process cools significantly the z=110 compound nuclei , so the temperature dependence of the friction and diffusion parameters could be `` visible '' in this case .      * one may introduce a more detailed description of the formation process of the compound nuclei .",
    "such a description will involve explicit trajectory calculations of the incident nuclei taking into account the nuclear and the coulomb potentials for different relative initial orientations of the deformed nuclei .",
    "calculations of relative potentials have been worked out in this framework @xcite but , to our knowledge , a full fledged dynamical trajectory calculation has yet to be done .",
    "* the full treatment of fusion fission dynamics with simultaneous emission of the light particles will release us from a somewhat arbitrary choice of the initial conditions for the compound nucleus .",
    "such a project is at present under investigation .",
    "* we used a classical description of fluctuations and a form of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem which are valid for the case of high temperature .",
    "in fact , the temperature of the systems which we considered above could be low enough for quantum effects ( pairing and shell effects ) to play a non negligible role .",
    "this point has been investigated in the recent past @xcite within the framework of nuclear transport theory @xcite .",
    "it is our aim to come back to this point in the near future . *",
    "our fission barrier estimates need also further improvements .",
    "the present model bases on a modified ( see appendix a ) liquid drop formula of myers and swiatecki @xcite and it is known that for the cold light nuclei like @xmath1ba it overestimates the fission barriers by @xmath161 mev @xcite .    for reasons of comparison with experiment we shall generalize our model taking asymmetric fission events into account .",
    "many compound nuclei generated from mass asymmetric formation process channels appear with a high statistical weight .",
    "last but not least it would be nice to extend the test of the model to observables other than the light particle emission rates .",
    "out - of plane particle angular distributions and correlations between emitted light particles would provide further sensitive tests of the validity of our approach .",
    "for instance , the ratio of neutrons emitted out of the reaction plane and within the reaction plane ( defined by the beam and the outgoing fission fragments ) would enable us to determine the deformation of the emitting compound nucleus .",
    "furthermore , we stress the importance of a measurement of the emitted neutrons , protons , and @xmath38-particles in the same system because the emission rates of these particles are reciprocally dependent on each other .",

    "<S> we present a comparison of our model treating fission dynamics in conjunction with light - particle ( @xmath0 ) evaporation with the available experimental data for the nuclei @xmath1ba , @xmath2pt and three isotopes of the element z=110 . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the symmetric fission process is described through the solution of a classical langevin equation for a single collective variable characterizing the nuclear deformation along the fission path . </S>",
    "<S> a microscopic approach is used to evaluate the emission rates for pre - fission light particles . </S>",
    "<S> entrance - channel effects are taken into account by generating an initial spin distribution of the compound nucleus formed by the fusion of two deformed nuclei with different relative orientations .    </S>",
