    "the idea of using these materials properties in cancer therapy has gained interest but important limitations have appeared like cancerous cell targeting and toxicity .",
    "gold nanoparticles ( gnps ) seem to overcome these difficulties because of their supposed non - toxicity @xcite and their capability to enter tumor cells @xcite .",
    "thus several studies on physical and biological gnps properties have been recently undertaken .",
    "biological studies have shown an important enhancement of the surviving rate on mice treated with x - ray radiations @xcite combined to gnps , whereas gnps without x - ray have no effect on tumor cells .",
    "this raises the question of the physical properties causing damages to cancerous cells when they interact with an ionizing radiation .",
    "these properties can be for example : hyperthermia causing cell death @xcite , radical production @xcite or electron emission .",
    "concerning this last property , one of the hypothesis @xcite is that gnps can cause damage to dna via low - energy electron emission .",
    "this is supported by experimental studies showing an enhancement of the dna breaks by gnps @xcite and the low - energy electron capability to break dna @xcite but also by theoretical studies showing the electron irradiation dose enhancement by gnps @xcite .",
    "but , this theory suffers from an important lack of experimental data .",
    "indeed there are very few experimental results available @xcite about electron emission of gnps undergoing x - ray radiation . in this paper , we will present and discuss experimental electronic emission spectra of gnps performed at x - ray photo - electron spectroscopy ( xps ) facility of ensiacet - cirimat ( toulouse , france ) , and compare them with the gold bulk spectrum .",
    "these experimental results will be compared to geant 4 simulations of irradiated citrate - coated and uncoated gnps performed with livermore and penelope models @xcite .",
    "the gnps used in our experiment were prepared using the turkevich method @xcite which produces gnps coated with a citrate ( @xmath0 ) monolayer .",

    "@xcite , in order to remove most of the citrate and the chemical reactants .",

    "gnps and gold bulk spectra were normalized to the integral of the first observed spectral line at @xmath11 for each spectrum .",
    "the choice of this line for normalization is motivated by the fact that it is well defined and its baseline is not perturbed by background induced by scattered electrons as observed for other gold spectral lines at lower kinetic energies .",
    "the x - ray energy available for this experiment was lower than the ones used in medical x - ray sources which can go from few tens of @xmath12 to few @xmath13 , because the large energy distributions of the x - ray medical sources do not allow the spectra analysis done in this paper with a highly monochromated source resulting in highly resolved electron spectra which are more interesting to compare to simulations results .",

    "<S> in this paper we present new results on electronic emission of gold nanoparticles ( gnps ) using x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) and compare them to the gold bulk electron emission . </S>",
    "<S> this subject has undergone new interest within the perspective of using gnps as a radiotherapy enhancer . </S>",

    "<S> our results show that the gnps coating is a key parameter to correctly construe the experimental gnps electronic emission after x - ray irradiation and point out some limitations of the penelope model . using xps spectra and geant4 livermore simulations , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method to determine precisely the coating surface density of the gnps . </S>",
