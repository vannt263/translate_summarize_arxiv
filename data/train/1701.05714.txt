    "a homogeneous magnetic field acting on charged particles has a localizing effect , both classically and quantum mechanically . since numerous physical effects are based on moving electrons between different places , mechanism that can produce transport in the presence of a magnetic field are of great interest .",
    "they typically require presence of an infinitely extended perturbation , a standard example being a barrier or a potential wall producing edges states , cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "this is not the only possibility , though . in",
    "his classical paper @xcite iwatsuka demonstrated that a transport can be induced be a modification of the magnetic field itself under the assumption of a translational invariance , see also @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to show still another mechanism which can produce transport in a homogeneous field for particles confined to a layer with hard walls . as in the case of the iwatsuka model",
    "we will express the effect in spectral terms seeking perturbations that change the hamiltonian spectrum to absolutely continuous .",
    "our departing point is a flat layer of width @xmath0 to which a charged particle is confined and which is exposed to the homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the layer plane .",
    "the spectrum of such a system is easily found by separation of variables .",
    "it combines the landau levels with the dirichlet laplacian eigenvalues in the perpendicular direction , and needless to say that all the resulting eigenvalues are infinitely degenerate , see sec .",
    "[ sss : flatlayer ] below for more details .",
    "we are going to discuss _ geometric perturbations _ of such a system , in particular , deformations of the layer which are invariant with respect to translation in a fixed direction .",
    "such layers can be described , e.g. , as a set of points satisfying @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a surface obtained by shifting a smooth curve which can be parametrized by relation below .",
    "we are going to derive several conditions which ensure that the unperturbed pure point spectrum will change into an absolutely continuous one .",
    "more specifically , our main results can be summarized in the following assertion .",
    "let @xmath3 be the hamiltonian of a charged quantum particle confined to a layer @xmath4 of a constant width @xmath0 in @xmath5 built over a @xmath6-smooth , translationally invariant surface and exposed to a nonzero homogeneous magnetic field pointing in the @xmath7-direction .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath3 is purely absolutely continuous if together with technical assumptions [ eq : curv_bound ] and [ eq : diff_cond ] any of the following conditions is satisfied :    a.   @xmath4 is a one - sided - fold layer , @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , we suppose that the second part of [ eq : v_bound ] is fulfilled .",
    "b.   @xmath4 is bent and asymptotically flat , @xmath10 for all large enough positive and negative @xmath11 , respectively , where @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , one requires that @xmath13 and the halfwidth @xmath14 satisfies the bound described in lemma  [ lem : ev_diff ] and remark  [ rem : a_crit_bound ] below .    moreover , for a fixed @xmath15 , the spectrum of @xmath3 below @xmath16 is absolutely continuous",
    "if @xmath4 is thin , i.e. the halfwidth @xmath14 is sufficiently small , and the generating surface satisfies one of the conditions specified in proposition  [ prop : thin ] .",
    "the proof of the theorem will be given in sec .",
    "[ s : classes ] , before coming to it we will describe the geometry of the layer and explain the main steps of the argument .",
    "let us add a few remarks .",
    "first of all , in sec .",
    "[ sss : flatlayer ] we demonstrate that the perturbation must be geometrically nontrivial , because a mere tilt of the layer with respect to the field direction is not enough , with one notable exception .",
    "furthermore , except the claim ( i ) our condition impose restrictions on the layer thickness . on the other hand ,",
    "the thinner the layer , the more general deformations we can treat . in particular , the last claim covers perturbations which are compact with respect to the @xmath17 variable , cf .",
    "proposition [ prop : thin ] .",
    "note also that the shift by @xmath18 in the last claim is needed ; without it the claim would be trivial because in a thin layer the spectral threshold is pushed up due to the dirichlet boundaries .",
    "the method used to treat thin layers is also useful with respect to the original iwatsuka model and its generalization including addition of a potential perturbation .",
    "recall , in particular , the conjecture stated in @xcite according to which _ any _ nontrivial translationally invariant magnetic perturbation gives rise to the purely absolutely continuous spectrum . despite a number of sufficient conditions derived after the original iwatsuka paper @xcite to which we add a new one in theorem  [ theo : iwatsuka ] ,",
    "the question in its generality remains open . in a similar vein",
    ", we are convinced that the sufficient conditions we find in this paper are by far not necessary .",
    "let @xmath2 be a surface in @xmath5 invariant with respect to translation in the @xmath19 direction and described by means of the following parametrization , @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "the functions @xmath17 and @xmath7 here are assumed to be smooth enough , unless said otherwise we suppose they are @xmath22 , and such that @xmath23 , where the dot stands for the derivative with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "the last condition means that the curve @xmath24 in the @xmath25 plane is parametrized by its arc length measured from some reference point on the curve .",
    "therefore the ( signed ) curvature @xmath26 of @xmath27 may be fixed as @xmath28 and the corresponding unit normal vector to @xmath2 is @xmath29 let us stress that throughout the paper we assume that @xmath30 if we regard @xmath2 as a riemannian manifold , then the metric induced by the immersion @xmath31 is @xmath32 let @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we define the layer @xmath4 of width @xmath0 built over the surface @xmath2 as the image of @xmath35 we will always assume that @xmath36 under these conditions , @xmath37 is a diffeomorphism onto @xmath4 as one can see , e.g. , from the formula for the metric @xmath38 on @xmath4 , induced by the immersion @xmath37 , that reads @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
