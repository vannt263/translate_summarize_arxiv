    "desem and chu  @xcite used this work to evaluate interaction minimization schemes in the context of fiber optics .",
    "we found that the key to understanding the stability of intrinsically complex stationary states perturbed by initial white noise for attractive nonlinearity lay in the overlapping regime of these two soliton interactions .",

    "[ fig:6](c ) , where it may be seen that though the peaks continue to exchange mass the overall integrity of the soliton - train remains intact .",
    "the drift of the train is similiar to that found for the cn - type stationary states in the adjacent regime , and as before , in the overlapping regime it is unstable while in the well - separated regime the peaks behave as independent solitons .",
    "the intrinsically complex stationary states have similiar properties to the real dn - type stationary states : in the adjacent regime they evolve and retain their overall integrity , and in other regimes they are unstable , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7](a)-(b ) .",
    "however , even in the unstable case they do not ever superimpose to make a sharp peak .",
    "this is due to the conservation of phase quantum number by the nlse . for the bec ,",
    "this is an important point . in higher dimensionality solutions to the nlse with attractive nonlinearity collapse",
    "this occurs when the density becomes large enough for the nonlinear term to dominate the kinetic energy .",
