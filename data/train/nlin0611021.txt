    "the dynamics of navier - stokes and euler equations is a challenging problem . in particular , such dynamics can be chaotic or turbulent .",
    "the main challenge comes from the large dimensionality of the phase space where the navier - stokes and euler equations pose extremely intricate flows . here",
    "the dynamics we refer to is the so - called eulerian , in contrast to the so - called lagrangian , dynamics of fluids .",
    "the eulerian dynamics is a dynamics in an infinite dimensional phase space ( e.g. a banach space ) posed by the cauchy problem of either the navier - stokes or the euler equations as partial differential equations .",
    "the lagrangian dynamics of fluid particles is a dynamics of a system of two or three ordinary differential equations with vector fields given by fluid velocities .",
    "the lagrangian dynamics of fluid particles in three dimensions can be chaotic even when the eulerian dynamics is steady ( e.g. the abc flow @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in appendix b , the lagrangian dynamics of 2d inviscid fluid particles is always integrable .    even though the global well - posedness of 3d navier - stokes and euler equations is still an interesting open mathematical problem , 3d navier - stokes and euler equations have local well - posedness which is often enough for a dynamical system study in the phase space .",
    "to begin such a dynamical system study , one needs to understand the spectra of the linear navier - stokes and/or euler operators @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the linear navier - stokes operators consist of eigenvalues , whereas the spectra of the linear euler operators contain continuous spectra .",
    "existence of invariant manifolds can be proved for navier - stokes equations @xcite , but is still open for euler equations .",
    "the size of the invariant manifolds for navier - stokes equations tends to zero in the zero viscosity limit @xcite .",
    "we find that the spectra of the linear navier - stokes and euler operators can be classified into four categories in the zero viscosity limit :    1 .",
    "_ persistence : _ these are the eigenvalues that persist and approach to the eigenvalues of the corresponding linear euler operator when the viscosity approaches zero",
    "condensation : _ these are the eigenvalues that approach and form a continuous spectrum for the corresponding linear euler operator when the viscosity approaches zero . 3 .   _ singularity : _ these are the eigenvalues that approach to a set that is not in the spectrum of the corresponding linear euler operator when the viscosity approaches zero . 4 .",
    "_ addition : _ this is a subset of the spectrum of the linear euler operator , which has no overlap with the zero viscosity limit set of the spectrum of the linear ns operator .",
    "we also find that as the viscosity approaches zero , the spectrum of the linear navier - stokes operator undergoes a fascinating deformation .",
    "focusing upon the persistent unstable eigenvalue , we propose a heteroclinics conjecture , i.e. there should be a heteroclinic orbit ( in fact heteroclinic cycles ) associating to the instability for euler equation .",
    "we will present both analytical and numerical study upon this heteroclinics conjecture .",
    "then we conduct a melnikov integral calculation along the numerically obtained approximate heteroclinic orbit .",
    "we also compare the melnikov prediction with the numerical simulation and control of chaos for the navier - stokes equations .",
    "numerically we mainly use the liapunov exponent as a measure of chaos . in some case",
    ", we also plot the poincar return map .",
    "we realize that the size of galerkin truncations for the full navier - stokes equations is limited by the computer ability .",
    "thus we propose two simpler models of the navier - stokes equations .",
    "for the so - called line model , we obtain numerically exact heteroclinic orbits for any size of galerkin truncations .",
    "we also realize that due to viscosity , the chaos in galerkin truncations of navier - stokes equations is often transient chaos , i.e. the chaos has a finite life time .",
    "infinite life time chaos can be observed in galerkin truncations of euler equations .",
    "chaos and turbulence have no good averages @xcite .",
    "the matter is more fundamental than just poor understanding of averages .",
    "the very mechanism of chaos leads to the impossibility of a good average @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , chaos and turbulence are ubiquitous . in high dimensional systems",
    ", there exists tubular chaos @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite which further confirms that there is no good average .",
    "the hope is that chaos and turbulence can be controlled .",
    "two aspects of control are practically important in applications : taming and enhancing .",
    "when an airplane meets turbulence , it will be nice , safer and economic if we can tame the turbulence into a laminar flow or a less turbulent flow @xcite @xcite @xcite . in a combustor , enhancing turbulence can get the fuel and oxidant mixed and burned more efficiently @xcite @xcite .",
    "theoretically , one can also make use of the ergodicity of chaos to gear an orbit to a specific target @xcite .",
    "many other possibilities of applications of control can be designed too .",
    "an advantage of the control is that it can be done in a trial - correction manner without a detailed knowledge of turbulence .",
    "clearly , control of chaos and turbulence has great industrial value . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the question is how much mathematis is in this control theory .",
    "so far , the mathematical merit of the theory of control of chaos is not nearly as great as proving the existence of chaos @xcite .",
    "obviously , a lot of good numerics is in this control theory . in this article",
    ", we will address this control theory from a mathematical perspective , and try to formulate some good mathematical problems .",
    "one can add a control to any equation .",
    "but the only meaningful controls are the ones that are practical .",
    "consider the 3d navier - stokes equations for example @xmath0 defined on a spatial domain @xmath1 with appropriate boundary conditions , where @xmath2 is the inverse of the reynolds number , and @xmath3 is the external force .",
    "assume that without the control @xmath4 , the solutions are turbulent .",
    "the goal is to find a practical control to either tame or enhance turbulence .",
    "for instance , a practical control @xmath5 should be spatially localized ( perhaps near the boundary ) .",
    "recently , there has been quite amount of works on numerical simulations of chaos in navier - stokes equations @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "here we try to combine numerics with analysis in terms of melnikov integrals . unlike the sine - gordon system studied in appendix a , analytical calculation of the melnikov integrals",
    "is not feasible at this moment for navier - stokes equations .",
    "so we will resort to numerical calculations .",
    "it is an interesting open mathematical problem that whether or not 2d euler equation is integrable as a hamiltonian system in the liouville sense .",
    "since 2d euler equation possesses infinitely many constants of motion , it is tempting to conjecture that 2d euler equation is integrable .",
    "another support to such a conjecture is that both 2d and 3d euler equations have lax pairs @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is even rational to conjecture that 3d euler equations are integrable .",
    "as mentioned above , we propose the so - called heteroclinics conjecture for euler equations , i.e. there exist heteroclinic cycles for euler equations .",
    "we numerically simulate the heteroclinic orbits and use the numerical results to conduct numerical calculations on melnikov integrals . in these numerical simulations",
    ", it is crucial to make use of known results on the spectra of linear navier - stokes and euler operators @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "we use the numerical melnikov integral as a tool for both predicting and controling chaos . as a measure of chaos",
    ", we calculate the liapunov exponents .",
    "we find that the calculated liapunov exponents depend on the computational time interval and the precision of the computation .",
    "nevertheless , as a measure of chaos , liapunov exponents prove to be very robust .",
    "since the chaos is often transient , we make comparison on the base of fixed time interval and fixed precision of computation .    our numerics resorts to galerkin truncations .",
    "but galerkin truncations are somewhat singular perturbations of euler equations .",
    "higher single fourier modes have more unstable eigenvalues .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to derive dynamical pictures for euler equations from their galerkin truncations . on the other hand , higher single fourier modes have more dissipation under navier - stokes flows .",
    "so galerkin truncations perform better for navier - stokes equations than euler equations . today",
    "s computer ability still limits the size of the galerkin truncations . with better future computer ability , galerkin truncations will paint better and better pictures of navier - stokes and euler equations .",
    "it seems also important to design special models that can picture special aspects of the dynamics of navier - stokes and euler equations .",
