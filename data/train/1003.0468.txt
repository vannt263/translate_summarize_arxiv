    "in the past few years the application of quantum information concepts to some long standing problems has led to a deeper understanding of those problems @xcite and , as a consequence , to the formulation of new methods to solve ( or calculate ) them .",
    "for example , the simulability of many body problems is determined by the amount of entanglement shared between the spins of the system @xcite .",
    "there is a number of quantities that can be calculated in order to analyze the information carried by a given state including the entanglement of formation @xcite , the fidelity @xcite and several kinds of entropies , entanglement witnesses and so on .",
    "of course it depends on the problem which quantity is more adequate , or accessible , to be calculated .    in the case of atomic or few body systems with continuous degrees of freedom",
    "a rather natural quantity is the von neumann entropy , it has been used to study a number of problems : helium like atom @xcite , @xcite , generation of entanglement via scattering @xcite , the dynamical entanglement of small molecules @xcite , and entanglement in hooke s atom @xcite .    in quantum dots ,",
    "most quantum information studies focus in the amount of entanglement carried by its eigenstates @xcite , or in the controllability of the system @xcite .",
    "both approaches are driven by the possible use of a quantum dot as the physical realization of a qubit@xcite .",
    "the controllability of the system is usually investigated ( or performed ) between the states with the lowest lying eigenenergies @xcite .",
    "besides the possible use of quantum dots as quantum information devices there are proposals to use them as photodetectors .",
    "the proposal is based on the use of resonance states because of its properties , in particular its large scattering section compared to the scattering sections of bounded states @xcite .",
    "the resonance states are slowly decaying scattering states characterized by a large but finite lifetime .",
    "resonances are also signaled by sharp , lorentzian - type peaks in the scattering matrix . in many cases of interest where",
    "complex scaling ( analytic dilatation ) techniques can be applied , resonances energies show up as isolated complex eigenvalues of the rotated hamiltonian @xcite . under this transformation",
    "the bound states remain exactly preserved and the resonance states are exposed as @xmath0 functions of the rotated hamiltonian .",
    "resonance states can be observed in two - electron quantum dots @xcite and two - electron atoms @xcite .",
    "recently , a work by ferrn , osenda , and serra @xcite studied the behavior of the von neumann entropy associated with @xmath1 approximations of resonance states of two electron quantum dots . in particular that work was focused in the resonance state that arises when the ground state loses its stability , _ i.e. _ the quantum dot does not have two electron bounded states any more .",
    "varying the parameters of the quantum dot allows the energy to cross the ionization threshold that separates the region where the two electron ground state is stable from the region where the quantum dot loses one electron .    in reference",
    "@xcite it was found that the von neumann entropy provide a way to obtain the real part of the energy of the resonance , in other words , the von neumann entropy provides a stabilization method . the numerical approximation used in @xcite allowed to obtain only a reduced number of energy levels ( in a region where the spectrum is continuous ) their method provided the real part of the energy of the resonance only for a discrete set of parameters and this set",
    "could not be chosen _ a priori_. notwithstanding this , ferrn _ et al .",
    "_ , conjectured that there is a well defined function @xmath2 , the von neumann entropy of the resonance state , which has a well defined value for every value of the real part of the energy of the resonance , @xmath3 .",
    "in this work we will show , if @xmath4 is the external parameter that drives the quantum dot through the ionization threshold , that the entropy @xmath5 is a smooth function of @xmath4 .",
    "also it is showed that the resonance state entropy calculated by ferrn _",
    "et al . _ is correct near the ionization threshold .",
    "we have studied other quantities , besides the entropy , that are good witnesses of resonance presence .",
    "one of them is the fidelity , which has been widely used @xcite in the detection of non - analytical behavior in the spectrum of quantum systems .",
    "the analysis of the fidelity provides a method to obtain the real part of the resonance energy from variational eigenstates .",
    "we introduce the _",
    "double orthogonality _ function ( do ) that measures changes in quantum states and detects the resonance region .",
    "the do compares the extended continuum states and the state near the resonance , also providing the real part of the resonance energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - two ]",
    "we present the model and briefly explain the technical details to obtain approximate eigenvalues , eigenfunctions , and the density of states for the problem . in section",
    "[ sec - three ] the fidelity is used to obtain the real part of the resonance energy and the double orthogonality is introduced as an alternative method . in section",
    "[ sec - four ] the linear entropy and the expectation value of the coulombian repulsion are studied using complex scaling methods .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec - conclu ] we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "there are many models of quantum dots , with different symmetries and interactions . in this work",
    "we consider a model with spherical symmetry , with two electrons interacting via the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the main results should not be affected by the particular potential choice as it is already known that the near threshold behavior and other critical quantities ( such as the critical exponents of the energy and other observables ) are mostly determined by the range of the involved potentials @xcite . therefore to model the dot potential we use a short - range potential suitable to apply the complex scaling method .",
    "after this considerations we propose the following hamiltonian @xmath6 for the system    @xmath7    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 the position operator of electron @xmath10 ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 determine the range and depth of the dot potential .",
    "after re - scaling with @xmath11 , in atomic units the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltoniano ] ) can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "we choose the exponential binding potential to take advantage of its analytical properties .",
    "in particular this potential is well behaved and the energy of the resonance states can be calculated using complex scaling methods .",
    "so , besides its simplicity , the exponential potential allows us to obtain independently the energy of the resonance state and a check for our results . the threshold energy , @xmath15 , of hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ hamil ] ) , that is , the one body ground state energy can be calculated exactly  @xcite and is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bessel function .    the discrete spectrum * and * the resonance states of the model given by eq . ( [ hamil ] )",
    "can be obtained approximately using @xmath0 variational functions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , if @xmath18 are the exact eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian , we look for variational approximations    @xmath19    where the @xmath20 must be chosen adequately and @xmath21 is the basis set size .",

    "the matrix elements of the kinetic energy , the coulombic repulsion between the electrons and other mathematical details involving the functions @xmath41 are given in references  @xcite , @xcite .",

    "( [ hamil ] ) , the resonance energies belong to the interval @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the resonance states can be analyzed using the spectrum obtained with a basis of @xmath0 functions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the levels above the threshold have several avoided crossings that `` surround '' the real part of the energy of the resonance state .",
    "the presence of a resonance can be made evident looking at the eigenvalues obtained numerically .",

    "the variational approximation provides a finite number of solutions with energy below zero . above the threshold",
    "there is not a clear cut criteria to choose the value of the variational parameter .",

    "the figure also shows the behavior of the ground state ( below the threshold ) and the real part of the energy of the resonance calculated using complex scaling ( above the threshold ) , this curve is used as a reference .",
    "the behavior of the smaller variational eigenvalue @xmath51 is rather clear , below the threshold @xmath51 is rather insensitive to the actual value of @xmath36 , the differences between @xmath52 and @xmath53 are smaller than the width of the lines shown in the figure . above the threshold",
    "the behavior changes , the curve for a given value of @xmath36 has two well defined regions , in each region @xmath54 is basically a straight line .",
    "the two straight lines in each region has a different slope and the change in the slope is located around @xmath50 .    in the case of @xmath55",
    "there are three regions , in each one of them the curve for a given value of @xmath36 is basically a straight line and the slope is different in each region .",
    "a feature that appears rather clearly is that , for fixed @xmath4 , the density of levels for energy unit is not uniform , despite that the curves @xmath56 are drawn for forty equally spaced @xmath57 s between @xmath48 and @xmath58 .",
    "this fact has been observed previously @xcite and the density of states can be written in terms of two contributions , a localized one and an extended one",
    ". the localized density of states is attributed to the presence of the resonance state , conversely the extended density of states is attributed to the continuum of states between @xmath59 .",

    "this fact has a clear interpretation , if the numerical method approximates @xmath50 with @xmath73 a large @xmath72 means that the numerical method is able to provide a large number of approximate levels , and so the continuum of states between @xmath45 is `` better '' approximated .",
    "it is worth to remark that the results obtained from the complex scaling method and from the density of states are in excellent agreement , see table  [ tabla1 ] .",
    "since the work of zanardi et al .",
    "@xcite there has been a growing interest in the fidelity approach as a mean to study quantum phase transitions @xcite , the information - theoretic differential geometry on quantum phase transitions ( qpt s ) @xcite or the disordered quantum @xmath74 model @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the fidelity is used to detect the change of behavior of the states of a quantum system .",
    "for example , if @xmath4 is the external parameter that drives a system through a qpt , the fidelity is the superposition @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the ground state of the system .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath77 is a good detector of critical behavior in ordered @xcite and disordered systems@xcite .    in the following",
    "we will show that the energy levels calculated using the variational approximation show critical behavior near the energy of the resonance , moreover the curve @xmath50 can be obtained from the fidelity .",
    "figure [ fidel1 ] shows the behavior of the function @xmath78 , where + @xmath79 , and @xmath80 is the @xmath81 eigenstate obtained with the variational approach .",
    "the behavior of @xmath82 is quite simple .",
    "the value of @xmath82 is very small , except near the avoided crossings where the value of @xmath82 increases rather steeply ( at least for small @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is so because near the avoided crossing the superposition @xmath83 .",
    "actually , @xmath84 near points such that @xmath73 has non analytical behavior .",
    "is for this reason that the fidelity is a good detector of quantum phase transitions @xcite . in a first order",
    "qpt the energy of the ground state is non analytical , and in a second order qpt the gap in the avoided crossing between the ground state and the first excited state goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the previous argument supports why @xmath85 has only one peak , while all the others functions @xmath86 have two peaks , the number of peaks is the number of avoided crossings of each level .",
    "however , since the resonance state lies somewhere between the avoided crossings it is natural to ask what feature of the fidelity signals the presence of the resonance . for a given level @xmath72 the value of the energy is fixed , so we must pick a distinctive feature of @xmath87 that is present for some @xmath88 , such that @xmath89 ( from here we will use @xmath90 or @xmath91 interchangeably ) .",

    "more interestingly , @xmath164 is where the imaginary part of @xmath174 became noticeable .",
    "from this fact we conclude that it is not possible to adequately approximate the coulombian repulsion of a resonance state , or its entropy , only with real @xmath0 variational functions despite its success when dealing with the resonance state spectrum .",
    "we define the complex scaled density operator of the resonance state by @xmath177 and the complex linear entropy @xmath178 where @xmath179 and @xmath167 is the eigenvector of eq .",
    "( [ complex - eigen ] ) .",
    "this definition is motivated by the fact that the density operator should be the projector onto the space spanned by @xmath180 . as the normalization eq .",

    "( [ complex - norm ] ) , we have that @xmath182 _ despite that both density operators have complex eigenvalues_.    figure  [ fig - complex - entropy ] shows that up to certain value of @xmath4 the real part of @xmath183 follows closely a envelope containing the minima of the functions @xmath143 .",
    "however , for @xmath4 large enough , @xmath183 gets apart from the functions @xmath143 .",
    "it is worth to mention that for @xmath170 large enough @xmath183 * does not depend on * @xmath170 . on the other hand , far away from the threshold , the complex",
    "scaling requires larger values of @xmath170 to isolate the resonance state eigenenergy , but in this regime the method becomes unstable . because of the numerical evidence , near the threshold the entropy calculated by ferrn _",
    "_ is basically correct , but for larger values of @xmath4 the amount of entanglement of the resonance state should be characterized by @xmath183 and not by any of the @xmath143 .",
    "we have presented numerical calculations about the behavior of the fidelity and the double orthogonality functions @xmath109 .",
    "the numerical results show that it is possible to obtain @xmath50 with great accuracy , for selected values of @xmath4 , without employing any stabilization method .",
    "these two methods to find @xmath50 do not depend on particular assumptions about the model or the variational method used to find approximate eigenfunctions above the threshold , their success depends on the ability of the approximate eigenstates to detect the non - analytical changes in the spectrum .",
    "the fidelity has been extensively used to detect quantum phase transitions in spin systems @xcite , the behavior of quasi - integrable systems @xcite , thermal phase transitions @xcite , etc . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this work is the first attempt to apply the concept of fidelity to resonance states and to the characterization of spectral properties of a system with non - normalizable eigenstates . besides",
    ", it is remarkable that the fidelity and the double orthogonality give the real part of the resonance eigenvalue using only real variational functions .",
    "this energy as a function of @xmath4 is obtained by moving the nonlinear parameter @xmath36 but _ without _ fitting as needed by standard stabilization methods . moreover , as shown by the tabulated values in table  [ tabla1 ] the fidelity provides @xmath50 as accurately as the density of states method , with considerable less numerical effort .",
    "we proposed a definition of the resonance entropy based on a complex scaled extension of the usual definition .",
    "the extension implies that the reduced density operator is not hermitian and has complex eigenvalues , resulting in a complex entropy .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the complex entropy are @xmath170 independent , as should be expected for the expectation value of an observable @xcite .",
    "this independence gives support to the interpretation of the real part of the entropy as the amount of entanglement of the resonance state .",
    "other kinds of resonances , as those that arise from perturbation of bound states embedded in the continuum , could be studied applying the same quantum information methods used in this paper .",
