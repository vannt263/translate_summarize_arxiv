    "after decades of extensive study , understanding the confinement of quarks and gluons in hadrons still is one of the great challenges in hadronic physics . to uncover its nature , hadronic reactions in a nuclear medium , either cold or hot ,",
    "are studied .",
    "typical examples are the measurements of hadron production on nuclear targets in semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering of leptons  @xcite and the jet - quenching and parton energy - loss phenomena observed in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite . in each case",
    "hadron yields are observed that are different from those observed in the corresponding reactions on free nucleons .",
    "the process that leads from the partons produced in the elementary interaction to the hadrons observed experimentally is commonly referred to as hadronization or fragmentation . according to theoretical estimates the hadronization process occurs over length scales varying from less than a femtometer to several tens of femtometers . at these",
    "length scales the magnitude of the strong coupling constant is such that perturbative techniques can not be applied .",
    "hence , hadronization is an intrinsically non - perturbative qcd process , for which only approximate theoretical approaches are presently available .",
    "experimental data are vital for supporting these theoretical developments , since they can be used to gauge or guide the calculations .    the hadronization process in free space has been studied extensively in @xmath18 annihilation experiments @xcite . as a result the spectra of particles produced and",
    "their kinematic dependences are rather well known .",
    "however , little is known about the space - time evolution of the process .",
    "semi - inclusive production of hadrons in deep - inelastic scattering of leptons from atomic nuclei provides a way to investigate this space - time development .",
    "leptoproduction of hadrons has the virtue that the energy and the momentum of the struck parton are well determined , as they are tagged by the scattered lepton . by using nuclei of increasing size",
    "one can investigate the time development of hadronization .",
    "if hadronization occurs quickly , i.e. , if the hadrons are produced at small distances compared to the size of atomic nuclei , the relevant interactions in the nuclear environment involve well - known hadronic cross sections such as the ones for pion - nucleon interactions .",
    "if , in contrast , hadronization occurs over large distances , the relevant interactions are partonic and involve the emission of gluons and quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "the two mechanisms lead to different predictions for the decrease in hadron yield , known as attenuation , on nuclei as compared to that on free nucleons .",
    "most likely , a combination of these two mechanisms contributes to the observed attenuation of hadron yields on nuclei .",
    "this expectation has led to a range of phenomenological approaches , which are briefly summarized in the next section .",
    "the available calculations cover a range of possible mechanisms ( partonic energy loss or hadronic absorption ) and time ( length ) scales ( from less than 1 fm to more than 10 fm ) , which results in different dependences on the various kinematic variables . in order to distinguish between these calculations precise hadron attenuation data",
    "are needed as a function of several kinematic variables for a range of nuclei and for several hadron types .",
    "exploratory measurements were first performed at slac  @xcite and later by the emc  @xcite and e665  @xcite collaborations .",
    "more recently many more data have been collected by the hermes collaboration at desy and the clas collaboration at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility  @xcite .",
    "some of the hermes data have been published already  @xcite .",
    "the clas data are presently being analysed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the full results from hermes on the multiplicities for the production of pions , kaons , protons , and antiprotons on helium , neon , krypton , and xenon targets relative to those for deuterium .",
    "it goes beyond the scope of the present paper to compare the data to the available theoretical calculations . instead",
    ", prominent features of the data are identified and used to address two key issues in the study of hadronization : ( i ) what are the time or length scales of the process , and ( ii ) what are the mechanisms that lead to nuclear attenuation ?    the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] the theoretical framework is described , and some representative theoretical models are summarized . in section  [ sec : exper ] those aspects of the hermes experiment that are relevant to the present measurements are presented . in section  [ sec : anal ] the data analysis is discussed , including the corrections to the raw data and the systematic uncertainties . the results for the attenuation as a function of various kinematic variables are presented and discussed in section  [ sec : res ] .",
    "this section has several subsections in which the features of the data , especially those related to the relevant time scales and mechanisms , and the @xmath0-dependence , are discussed separately .",
    "the results are summarized in the last section , which also lists the conclusions .",
    "in order to put the experimental results into perspective , in this section the concepts that are used in the study of hadronization are presented , and models that have been developed to describe the experimental results are briefly discussed .",
    "it is emphasized that the latter is meant only to illustrate potential interpretations of the data .",
    "the experimental data and the features that they exhibit are the genuine subject .",
    "the hadronization process in a nuclear medium can be studied by means of semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) of electrons or positrons from nuclei . for that purpose the multiplicity ratio @xmath19",
    "is introduced , which is defined as the ratio of the number of hadrons @xmath13 produced per deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) event on a nuclear target with mass number @xmath0 to that for a deuterium ( d ) target .",
    "figure  [ kinematicplot ] illustrates the definition of the relevant lepton and hadron kinematic variables .",
    "the ratio @xmath20 depends on the leptonic variables @xmath9 , the energy of the virtual photon , and @xmath11 , the negative of the four - momentum of the virtual photon squared , and on the hadronic variables @xmath21 , the fraction of the virtual - photon energy carried by the hadron , and @xmath12 , the square of the hadron momentum component transverse to the direction of the virtual photon . thus @xmath20 can be written as : @xmath22 with @xmath23 the number of semi - inclusive hadrons at given @xmath24 , and @xmath25 the number of inclusive dis leptons at @xmath26 .",
    "implicit in this definition is the integration over the angle @xmath27 between the lepton scattering plane and the hadron production plane ( see fig .",
    "[ kinematicplot ] ) .",
    "experiments at large values of @xmath9  @xcite give values @xmath28 within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "this is interpreted as an indication that nuclear effects are negligible in that region . at lower values of @xmath9",
    "the value of @xmath20 has been found to be well below unity  @xcite .    even though hadronization is not",
    "yet quantitatively understood , it is generally assumed that the following processes play a role in leptoproduction of hadrons .",
    "after a quark in a nucleon has absorbed the virtual photon , it can lose energy by scattering from other quarks and by radiating gluons . as a result the value of @xmath1 may be influenced .",
    "a change in @xmath1 can also result from the quark in a nucleus having a different distribution function as a result of partonic rescaling .",
    "these two effects will be called partonic mechanisms .    after a certain time a colourless object , called a prehadron , is formed , which has the quantum numbers of the final hadron , but not yet its full wave function .",
    "the concept of colour transparency  @xcite is closely related to this .",
    "the prehadron then evolves over some time into the physical hadron . in the lund model",
    "@xcite the process of ( pre)hadron formation is described as the building of a colour field ( string ) between the struck quark and the residual system . the string gets stretched and breaks into smaller pieces , each with an ( anti-)quark at both ends .",
    "the lund model gives predictions ( see ,  e.g. ,  ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the time @xmath29 , and the corresponding ( constituent or formation ) length @xmath30 , that it takes for the prehadron to be formed , and the time @xmath31 required for the final physical hadron to be formed . ) is used for what is often called the prehadron ( or constituent ) formation length , and hadron formation length  ( @xmath32 ) for the hadron ( or yo - yo ) formation length ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . ]    the average value of the formation length @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath15 , is given in the lund model by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a function that goes as @xmath35 for large values of @xmath10 ( this behaviour is also found in other models , and is due to the fact that in the limit @xmath36 the struck quark can not have lost any energy when producing the final hadron ) , and has a broad maximum of about 0.4 around @xmath37 .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 is the string tension , which reflects the energy loss of the leading quark per unit length , usually taken as @xmath39  gev / fm .",
    "thus , at values of @xmath9 of @xmath40 gev , the prehadron formation takes place over distances of about @xmath41 fm , comparable to the size of a nucleus .",
    "the values of @xmath32 are larger than @xmath30 , so the final hadron is often formed outside the nucleus .",
    "if the ( pre)hadron is formed inside the nucleus , it can experience hadronic interactions , generally called final - state interactions ( fsi ) . for discussing the effects of these , we will not discriminate between prehadrons and hadrons , and just talk about hadrons and hadronic effects , although the relevant cross sections may be different for hadrons and prehadrons .",
    "the first effect of fsi may be the rescattering of the hadron from the nucleons in the nucleus , the hadron losing energy and possibly generating other , mainly low energy , hadrons ( if these are mesons , the word generate can be taken literally ; if these are nucleons , generated means that they are now in a continuum state ) .",
    "the effect is thus a loss of hadrons at a given value of @xmath10 , and an increase of the same hadron , but possibly also of other hadrons , at lower @xmath10 .",
    "another effect of fsi can be that the original hadron is absorbed .",
    "this is usually accompanied by the emission of other , again mainly low - energy , hadrons .",
    "so also in this case there is a loss of hadrons at given @xmath10 , and an increase of other hadrons at lower @xmath10 . for a full description of all these effects",
    ", coupled - channel calculations should be performed .",
    "however , since these are rather complicated , in models usually only absorption is considered .",
    "clearly this neglects the generation of hadrons at lower values of @xmath10 .    the change from partonic mechanisms to hadronic mechanisms , which depends on the formation length relative to the size of the nucleus , influences @xmath1 .",
    "thus the use of various nuclear targets allows one to investigate the space - time development of the hadronization process .    at present , reliable qcd calculations of quark hadronization ( fragmentation )",
    "can not yet be performed because of the major role of soft , i.e. , non - perturbative processes .",
    "for that reason various types of models have been developed .",
    "phenomenological models  @xcite use formation times / lengths and absorption cross sections for the various hadrons in the nuclear medium .",
    "various formulae for the formation lengths have been used , and in the more advanced versions two length scales , @xmath30 and @xmath32 , are distinguished , as well as different absorption cross sections for the quark , the prehadron , and the final hadron .",
    "the absorption cross sections are usually adjusted to obtain the best description of the @xmath9- and @xmath10-dependence of the experimental data .",
    "other ( qcd - inspired ) models focus on the energy loss that the struck quark experiences in the nuclear environment  @xcite . in refs .  @xcite twist-4 contributions to the fragmentation functions resulting from multiple scattering and gluon bremsstrahlung in a nuclear medium are calculated .",
    "a nuclear attenuation proportional to @xmath42 is predicted , where the power @xmath43 results from the coherence of the gluon radiation process  @xcite , which gives an induced radiative energy loss of a quark traversing a length @xmath44 of matter proportional to @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "no hadron absorption is included , as it is assumed that the hadron is formed outside the nucleus .",
    "the effect of a finite formation length is included in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which fragmentation functions are calculated that are again modified due to partonic energy loss in the nuclear medium during the time @xmath29 . by using the quark energy loss determined from drell - yan data , a reasonable agreement with existing data is found . in order to keep the approach as simple as possible , absorption of the produced ( pre)hadron is not taken into account .",
    "another class of models includes ( pre)hadron absorption , with or without a description of what happens in the hadronization process . in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath1 is described in terms of medium - modified fragmentation functions supplemented by nuclear absorption .",
    "a parton - rescaling model that has also been used to describe the emc effect is used to describe the nuclear modification of the fragmentation functions .",
    "the ( average ) formation length is taken from the lund model  @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculates the nuclear attenuation of the ( leading ) hadron with @xmath46 by including as major ingredients the formation length @xmath30 and an absorption cross section of the prehadron .",
    "the effect of quark energy loss is found to be small . in ref .",
    "@xcite the hadron attenuation is investigated within the framework of the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck transport model . since this is a coupled - channel approach ,",
    "hadrons are not only absorbed , but can also be produced .",
    "some choices for the formation time @xmath29 , including taking it to be zero , are studied .",
    "the theoretical calculations have been compared to the data from refs .",
    "notwithstanding their different and sometimes orthogonal ingredients , all models reproduce the global features of the data . in the case of the @xmath9-dependence , which is best described , the reason may be that the decreasing attenuation with increasing value of @xmath9 is largely due to a simple increase of the formation time @xmath29 with @xmath9 in the target rest frame due to lorentz dilatation .",
    "the dependence of @xmath1 on @xmath10 and @xmath0 , which in general is less well described , may be more discriminating , especially when more detailed data are available .",
    "the measurements were performed with the hermes spectrometer  @xcite using a 27.6  gev positron or electron beam stored in the hera ring at desy .",
    "some data were collected using a 12.0  gev positron beam  @xcite , but since the amount of data was much less and only pions or all hadrons were identified , they are not included here .",
    "typical beam currents were 40  ma down to 5  ma .",
    "the spectrometer consists of two mirror - symmetric halves , located above and below the lepton beam pipe .",
    "a flux - exclusion plate in the midplane of the magnet prevents deflection of the lepton ( and proton ) beams passing through the center of the spectrometer .",
    "the scattered leptons and the produced hadrons were detected within an angular acceptance of @xmath47 170 mrad horizontally and @xmath47 ( 40  140 ) mrad vertically .",
    "the lepton trigger was formed by a coincidence between signals from three scintillator hodoscope planes and a lead - glass calorimeter .",
    "a minimum energy deposit in the latter of 3.5 gev ( 1.4 gev ) for unpolarized ( polarized ) target runs was required .",
    "the data were collected during the years 1999 , 2000 , 2004 , and 2005 , using unpolarized nuclear ( he , ne , kr , xe ) and polarized or unpolarized deuterium ( d ) gaseous targets internal to the storage ring ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) . in 1997 also data on nitrogen were taken , but since at that time the rich detector ( see below ) was not yet available , only data for pions and all hadrons together could be presented  @xcite .",
    "therefore these data are not included here .",
    "the yields from polarized deuterium were summed over the two spin orientations .",
    "the target gases were injected into a 40  cm long tubular open - ended storage cell . using an unpolarized gas feed system  @xcite it is possible to provide d , he , n , ne , kr , or xe targets with relatively high areal densities ( between 10@xmath48 and 10@xmath49 nucleons/@xmath50 ) , resulting in luminosities ranging from 10@xmath51 to 10@xmath52@xmath53s@xmath54 .",
    "such high - density runs were taken at the end of hera fills , with typical currents of 15 to 5 ma and beam lifetimes of one hour .",
    "this made it possible to accumulate the data for these targets in only a few days of integrated beam time .",
    "the luminosity was measured using elastic scattering of the beam particles from the electrons in the target gas : bhabha scattering for a positron beam , mller scattering for an electron beam  @xcite ."
