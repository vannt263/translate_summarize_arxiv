    "the three - dimensional representation of an object has been used in several fields such as bioinformatics , image synthesis and other domains .",
    "several methods have been proposed to reconstruct an object from one image such as the shape from shading ( sfs ) or two or more images such as the stereo - vision or the stereo - photometry .",
    "the shape from shading is the reconstruction of a 3d object from a single grayscale image .",
    "horn @xcite is the first who introduced the notion of sfs in the 70s .",
    "the difficulty of solving the sfs resides in the local ambiguity @xcite ( convex / concave ) , it lead the researchers to impose constraints and limitations on the surface of the 3d object , the light source and camera model , as well as other information on the solution ( eg . the singular points @xcite and boundary condition @xcite ) .",
    "d.durou @xcite classified the resolution methods of the sfs into three classes :    the first class are the methods of resolution by the partial differential equations methods ( pde ) , in witch the sfs is represented by the pde like eikonal , hamilton - jacobi equations . among these methods the characteristic strips expansion @xcite .",
    "bruss @xcite provides the first solution of the eikonal equation by power series expansion .",
    "kimmel and buckstein @xcite propose a global solution using the level - set method .",
    "abada and aouat @xcite propose a new resolution method using the tabu search .",
    "rouy and tourin @xcite propose a method that use the theory of the viscosity solutions to solve the pde of the first order .",
    "prados @xcite shows several scheme for solving hamilton - jacoubi equation(pde ) in both cases the perspective and the parallel projections .",
    "the second class are methods which approximate the image irradiance equation .",
    "this category is divided into two subclass : methods of local resolutions @xcite in which the approximation of the variation of the surface in each point is through the point and its neighbors .",
    "the second subclass , are the methods of linear resolution .",
    "these methods approximate the reflectance equation ( non - linear ) by a linear equation .",
    "generally the methods of this category are easy to implement but do not treat the local ambiguity ( convex / concave )    the third category concerns the optimization methods .",
    "these methods are based on the the variational approaches .",
    "this paper is organized as follow :    in section 2 , we will show the basic notion of the image formation used to solve the shape from shading .    in section 3",
    ", we will give an overview of the global view method proposed by shi and zhu@xcite .    in section 4",
    ", we will discuss the problems of the global view method and we will detail the improvements proposed to solve these problems .    in section 5 , we will show the obtained results and we will compare our results with the results obtained by shi and zhu .",
    "equation [ eq : eq_1_2 ] represents the basic equation of the images formation ( for more details see @xcite ) : @xmath0        the luminance of a lambert surface can be expressed as follows :    @xmath1    @xmath2    @xmath3 is the gradient of @xmath4 .    from ( [ eq : eq_1_2]),([eq : eq_5]),([eq : eq_1111 ] ) we can show that ( for more details see @xcite ) :    @xmath5    equation [ eq : eq_eikonal ] is called `` eikonal equation '' , we will use it later in this paper .",
    "several works have proposed to solve the eikonal equation ( eq.[eq : eq_eikonal ] ) . among these methods the fast marching method(fmm)@xcite . if the minimum distance ( shortest path ) between two points on the surface is monotony , the difference of depth @xmath6 between theme can be computed .",
    "@xmath6 can be computed using the following equation @xcite : @xmath7    @xmath8 are the vertex of the edge extremities .",
    "@xmath6 is the difference in altitude of @xmath8 .",
    "and l contains all the paths from @xmath8 .",
    "the method proposed by shi and zhu @xcite ( global view ) is very interesting , it is based on the graph theory and the relationships between the singular points . such as",
    "the singular points represent the vertex and the relationship between these points represent the edges of the graph .",
    "there is a relationship between two singular points only if the minimum distance ( shortest path that check equation [ eq : eq_1223 ] ) between two singulars points is monotone ( increasing or decreasing ) .",
    "kimmel and bruckstein @xcite observed that the singular points and the relationships between them are very important to determine the local ambiguity .",
    "shi and zhu model the shape from shading problem as a max - cut problem and they use a max - cut solution to solve the sfs problem , this solution is very slow ( np - complete ) with big graph ( more than ten singular points ) but it solves partially the local ambiguity .",
    "the weight of the edge represent the difference in altitude ( @xmath9 ) between the vertex of the two extremities .",
    "it can be computed by solving the eikonal equation ( equation [ eq : eq_eikonal ] ) using the shortest path that check the equation [ eq : eq_1223 ] .",
    "we denote : + @xmath10 a graph of n vertex and m edges such that : + @xmath11 set of singular points ; + @xmath12 set of edges ; + @xmath13 set of weight ; + @xmath14 the graph configuration",
    ". + the configuration of the edge is the direction of the monotony of the edge ( - is down and + is up ) .",
    "the configuration of the graph is the configuration of all the edges of this graph .",
    "a configuration represents a possible solution .",
    "figure ( [ ambe1].a ) shows the image of the 3d surface generated by the function @xmath15 .",
    "it contains two singular points ( p1,p2 ) , one is a local maximum and the other is a local minimum . if the shortest path between the two points is monotone , then there exists an edge between the two points .",
    "two possible configurations is observed , the first is the path from p1 to p2 is increasing ( the configuration ( p1 , p2 ) is `` + '' ) or the reverse ( the configuration ( p1 , p2 ) is `` - '' ) .",
    "both configurations generates two different objects but both form the same original picture .",
    "so we can not determine the ambiguity using only the singular points we need an additional information .",
    "we analyze a more complex example , figure ( [ ambe2 ] ) shows the graph generated from the image of the silt , it shows also a possible configuration of the graph of the silt .",
    "note that the reverse configuration is also a solution of the graph but it generates a reverse 3d object .",
    "there are other images that can generate multiple configurations that construct several different objects , but these objects form the same original image , and one object that is the correct .",
    "from the above examples we can see that whenever the number of edges between the singulars points increases , the ambiguity decreases .    we can distinguish three types of ambiguity :    - the edge ambiguity : if two singular points are connected by a single edge ( there is no other path from the first point to the second ) then the two possible configurations ( + /-",
    ") of the edge can be resolved by the `` max - cut '' problem for this edge ( figure [ fig : free].a ) ( we call this edge in this work `` free edge '' ) .",
    "- the parts ambiguity : if two parts of the graph are connected by one and only one path or vertex ( figures [ fig : free].a,[fig : free].b ) , then the configurations of both parts are independent .",
    "( we call these parts of the graph `` free part '' ) . a free part may have two solutions the best configuration ( computed by max - cut ) and its reverse .    - the global ambiguity : in the best case , where the graph consists of a single free part and there is no free edge in this case there is only two solutions the configuration computed by max - cut and its inverse .    note",
    ": free edge is a particular case of the free part , such that this part consists from only two singular points . if all singular points of the graph are connected by at least two paths then the global graph composed by only one free part .    [",

    "the shape from shading problem is known by its local ambiguity , the use of the singular points can solve this ambiguity , but only in the case where the singular points are interconnecting . in this work we showed that the singular points are necessary but not sufficient to resolve this ambiguity .",
