    "breaking @xmath5 by a field with even charge ( the canonical @xmath5 model ) guarantees automatic @xmath0-parity conservation even below the symmetry scale , since only @xmath5 violation by an even amount is allowed .",
    "an alternative is @xmath5 breaking through the right - handed sneutrino , a field which must always be included due to anomaly cancellation . since the right - handed sneutrino has a charge of one , its vev results in spontaneous @xmath0-parity violation .",
    "phenomenologically , this is a viable scenario that does not induce tree - level rapid proton decay and dark matter is still possible if the gravitino is the lsp .",
    "recently , spontaneous @xmath0-parity violation has been studied in the case of minimal @xmath5 models  @xcite",
    ". however , the following question is still relevant : _ does the canonical @xmath5 model favors @xmath0-parity conservation or violation?_. in this letter we study this question in the simplest local @xmath6 extension of the mssm assuming for simplicity msugra boundary conditions for the soft terms .",
    "we investigate the fate of @xmath0-parity using the radiative symmetry breaking mechanism and show that for the majority of the parameter space , @xmath0-parity is broken , namely it is the right - handed sneutrino that acquires a negative mass squared and therefore a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",

    "addressing the values of these vevs requires the minimization conditions which can be derived from the full potential where @xmath17 : @xmath18 only two cases exist for spontaneous @xmath5 symmetry breaking : case _ i _ ) @xmath19 implying @xmath0-parity conservation or case _ ii _ ) @xmath20 implying spontaneous @xmath0-parity violation . note",
