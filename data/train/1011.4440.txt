    "interrelation between magnetism and superconductivity continues to be a subject of extensive study in the research of the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductivity . in the underdoped regime of la-214 and y-123 cuprates ,",
    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath1sr )  @xcite and nuclear magnetic / quadrapole resonance ( nmr / nqr )  @xcite experiments have uncovered the emergence of a spin - glass - like static magnetic state below the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , an incommensurate static magnetic state relating to the so - called spin - charge stripe order  @xcite has been observed from neutron - scattering experiments in underdoped la-214 cuprates .",
    "@xcite in the overdoped regime of la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath4 ( lsco ) , a linear relationship between the dynamic spin susceptibility due to the incommensurate cu - spin correlation ( csc ) and @xmath0 has been suggested from neutron - scattering experiments .",
    "@xcite these results indicate the existence of csc in a wide range of hole concentration where superconductivity appears , and therefore imply a significant relationship between csc and high-@xmath0 superconductivity .",
    "it is well - known that csc tends to be developed through the partial substitution of impurities for cu in high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "our comprehensive @xmath1sr studies on partially zn - substituted lsco  @xcite have revealed that csc is developed through the substitution of a small amount of zn in the whole superconducting regime of @xmath5 and that a magnetic order is formed at low temperatures below @xmath6 .",
    "these can be understood in terms of the zn - induced development of the stripe correlations , suggesting an intimate relation between the stripe correlations and superconductivity .",
    "one may doubt , however , the universality of the superconductivity relating to the stripes , since effects of the stripes on various properties appear markedly in the la-214 cuprates . here , it is the mono - layer bi-2201 cuprate that has a potential to clear off the above suspicion , because the partial substitution of pb or la in the bi-2201 cuprate allows us to have samples with a wide range of hole concentration from the underdoped to overdoped regime .",

    "it has been observed that the depolarization of muon spins due to the development of csc becomes marked with decreasing temperature below 2 k and that the zn substitution enhances csc in the whole superconducting regime of the bi-2201 cuprate .",

    "@xcite these neutron - scattering results are very similar to those observed in lsco ,  @xcite suggesting that the observed csc in bpsczo is the stripe correlations in origin .",
    "as observed in the present @xmath1sr and neutron - scattering results ,  @xcite the unambiguous characteristic in bpsczo is that the development of csc is not so noticeable as in lsco .",
    "this may be due to the weakness of the stripe correlations and/or the strong two - dimensionality of the crystal structure in bpsczo due to the long distance between the neighboring cuo@xmath7 planes .",

    "the observation of the slight enhancement of the depolarization rate in the non - superconducting heavily overdoped sample of bpsczo seems to be a challenge to the common wisdom and might be related to the recent suggestion in lsco on the appearance of a ferromagnetic state .",

    "the slightly enhanced depolarization of muon spins below 2 k in the non - superconducting heavily overdoped sample of bpsczo might have the same origin as in the case of lsco , although further investigation should be performed to pin down this issue .",
    "intriguingly , the depolarization rate is reduced through the zn substitution in the non - superconducting heavily overdoped sample as shown in fig . 5 , which is opposite to that observed in the superconducting regime .",
    "this implies a different origin of the development of csc from the stripe - related magnetism in the superconducting regime . assuming the formation of a ferromagnetic state , it may be locally destroyed around zn , leading to the decrease in the depolarization rate through the zn substitution .",
