    "our recent work  @xcite has demonstrated the utility of the virtual crystal approximation ( vca )  @xcite to study compositionally disordered materials .",
    "following our initial vca study of a stress - induced phase transition in pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath1)o@xmath2 , we and other authors have extended the vca to studies of compositional phase transitions  @xcite , temperature - dependent phase transitions  @xcite , and dynamical properties .",
    "@xcite prior to this the vca has had some success in providing qualitative , and in some instances quantitative agreement with large - scale solid - state calculations .",
    "previous implementations of the vca have focused on the averaging of two or more component potentials in separable form at the solid - state level .",
    "@xcite by averaging the potentials , it is difficult to assess the quality of the resulting vca potential . in some studies , these traditional vca potentials have yielded unphysical results .",
    "@xcite speculation has been made in the literature that it is the inability of these traditional vca potentials to capture the important differences in chemical bonding and ionicity accurately that has given the poor results .",
    "due to the inconsistencies in the literature regarding the quality of vca results , we have recently formulated a new approach for the construction of vca potentials .",
    "our method represents a simple and intuitive way to construct vca potentials and assess their quality .",
    "it is a severe departure from the more traditional methods for vca potential construction .",
    "we have previously presented a thorough description of our method for the construction of vca atoms .",
    "@xcite for brevity , we will only present here the salient points of our method .    *",
    "our method averages the component atoms at the all - electron level , such that all - electron eigenvalues , potentials , wave functions and charge density are all computed for the virtual atom .",
    "since the solution of the all - electron atom is common to all pseudopotential procedures , our method is general enough to be used in all types of pseudopotential construction .",
    "+ operationally we find the all - electron wave functions and eigenvalues for the atoms we want to average .",
    "we then determine the properly averaged eigenvalues for the vca atom valence states from the eigenvalues of the all - electron atoms .",
    "we then construct a bare coulombic potential from the properly averaged bare nuclear potentials of the component atoms and a properly averaged core charge density . in doing so",
    ", we have insured that the resulting vca potential will have the correct averaged size . using this averaged nuclear potential and frozen - core charge density ,",
    "we construct new self - consistent wave functions for the vca atom valence states .",
    "we require that these new wave functions solve the kohn - sham equations in the valence region and give the properly averaged eigenvalues . * from this new set of potentials and wave functions , we construct an optimized pseudopotential .  @xcite this method enforces the exact agreement of the vca eigenvalues with the averaged all - electron eigenvalues for the reference state _",
    "only_. for any other electronic configuration , we have made no requirements on the quality of the potential .",
    "recently , we have formulated the designed nonlocal pseudopotential method ,  @xcite in which we exploit the inherent arbitrary separation of the local potential and semilocal correction terms required for the kleinman - bylander separable form .",
    "@xcite by adjusting the form of the local potential and therefore the correction terms , we may dramatically improve the transferability of the potential without affecting the exact agreement at the reference configuration .",
    "this transferability improvement over a wide range of electronic configurations insures correct ionicity and polarizability of the virtual atom .",
    "it is our assertion that the preservation of the proper averaged size of the vca potential and a high level of transferability will provide accurate vca atoms which yield excellent agreement with superlattice calculations .",
    "we have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of our new vca approach .",
    "@xcite the remainder of this paper will focus on the construction and use of two vca potentials to study the compositional phase transition in pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 .",

    "it is important to note that although we have included multiple @xmath10-channel states , only one @xmath10 nonlocal projector is used . for both vca atoms",

    "the transferability testing results for the two vca potentials are contained in table 2 . from the table , it is evident that our new vca pseudopotentials are highly transferable at either value of @xmath9 .",
    "we use both vca potentials in solid - state calculations for three structural phases of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 .",

    "brillouin zone integrations are approximated accurately as sums on a 4@xmath124@xmath124 monkhorst - pack @xmath13-point mesh .",
    "@xcite    we have included three structurally distinct phases of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 in the current studies of compositions between @xmath3 and @xmath4 : a tetragonal ti - rich @xmath14 and two rhombohedral zr - rich ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) phases .",
    "@xcite around 400 - 500k , the rhombohedral region exhibits a boundary between @xmath15 ( low - temperature ) and @xmath16 ( high - temperature ) phases , which depends weakly on composition .",
    "@xcite the @xmath15 phase shows complex oxygen octahedral tilting , which doubles the primitive unit cell to ten atoms .",
    "@xcite    we have completed full electronic and structural relaxations for five - atom unit cells for the tetragonal and high - temperature rhombohedral phases . due to the complex oxygen octahedral distortions , we have used a 10-atom unit cell for the low - temperature rhombohedral phase .",
    "for all rhombohedral calculations , we have neglected the small shear relaxations .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the equations of state for the three phases of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "we find the tetragonal phase is the ground - state structure for this composition lying approximately 0.05 ev lower in energy than both rhombohedral phases .",
    "this is correct energy ordering found experimentally .",
    "@xcite    = 3.5 in    in figure 2 , we show the equations of state for the three phases of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 at @xmath4 . we find both rhombohedral phases have shifted down in energy relative to the tetragonal phase . in fact , the low - temperature rhombohedral phase has shifted by approximately 0.09 ev in energy and therefore becomes the ground - state structure for this composition of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 .",
    "this result is in direct agreement with the experimental findings  @xcite and demonstrates the ability of our new vca method to locate and predict compositional phase transitions .",
    "in this paper , we have applied our new method for constructing a virtual crystal pseudopotential to the zr and ti atoms .",
    "potentials constructed with our method not only possess the properly averaged atomic size but also a high level of accuracy in describing energetic differences due to changes in both ionicity and polarizability .",
    "this method is based on averaging all - electron information and therefore makes the method applicable to all types of pseudopotential construction algorithms .",
    "we have used our new method to construct two zr@xmath0ti@xmath5 vca potentials at @xmath3 and @xmath4 . with these potentials ,",
    "we have studied three structural phase of pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 , finding that the tetragonal phase is the ground - state structure for pb(zr@xmath0ti@xmath5)o@xmath2 at @xmath3 . when moving to @xmath4 , we find that the low - temperature rhombohedral phase becomes the ground - state .",
    "this finding is in excellent agreement with experiment and represents the first @xmath17 @xmath18 determination of a compositionally - dependent phase transition in a ferroelectric oxide .",
