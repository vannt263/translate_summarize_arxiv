    "the density dependencies of the real and of the imaginary part of the effective amplitude @xmath80 are of particular interest because they are related to characteristic features of phenomenological optical potentials .",
    "it was shown already in 1993 @xcite that with empirical density - dependent potentials , where the effective @xmath0 scattering amplitude within a @xmath81 model depends on the density , improved fits to the data were obtained compared to fits using fixed amplitudes .",

    "qualitatively similar results are obtained also in the  with se \" version , see ref .",
    "regions of low density , i.e. large radii , are the most effective in determining the r.m.s .",
    "radius of a distribution and the sharp rise of the real part in the extreme surface region can lead to compression of the real potential .",
    "the opposite dependence is observed for the imaginary part , thus implying _ inflation _ of the imaginary potential relative to the nuclear density .",
    "quantitatively , however , the change of r.m.s .",
    "radii relative to nuclear densities is found to disagree with the empirical trends of ref .",
    "@xcite , with too little compression for the real part and far too strong inflation for the imaginary part .",
    "inevitably this is reflected in the quality of agreement with the data , as demonstrated in the next section .",
    "strong - interaction effects in kaonic atoms are dominated by absorption , as is evident from level widths being significantly larger than the corresponding level shifts .",
    "moreover , the shifts are always repulsive although the real potential is attractive , again pointing to the dominance of absorption .",
    "therefore it is argued that the above marked decrease of the imaginary part of the effective scattering amplitude is the main deficiency of the present model , a decrease originating in the sharp decrease of the imaginary part of the free amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo30 ] ) towards the @xmath32 threshold , which is typical of the single - nucleon approach .",
    "consequently it is reasonable to expect that additional , multi - nucleon terms are required to obtain good fit to the data .",

    "the potentials marked nlo30 follow directly from the in - medium @xmath0 amplitudes in model nlo30 , without any adjustable parameters .",
    "the agreement with the full data set of 65 points , covering the whole periodic table , is poor , with @xmath86 per point in the range of @xmath87 .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the obvious deficiency of the single - nucleon approach where the imaginary part of the amplitude goes down rapidly towards far subthreshold energies . adding to the potential",
    "an empirical term linear in the nuclear density does not improve much the fit to kaonic atoms data and only by further addition of a @xmath88 or a @xmath89 term good fits to the data are possible .",
    "both imaginary and real parts of the additional phenomenological potential are then found to be dominated by @xmath90 or @xmath91 terms which are likely to represent multi - nucleon absorptive and dispersive contributions , respectively .",

    "however , values of the potential at the center are rather meaningless in the context of kaonic atom observables . the sensitivity of calculated level shifts and widths to the @xmath2 nuclear potentials was found @xcite to be around the nuclear surface and certainly not at the center . with that in mind and focusing on the imaginary potential as noted above",
