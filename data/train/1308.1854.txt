    "our experiments are performed using 87-rubidium atoms in magneto - optical traps ( mots ) that are excited to @xmath0 rydberg states using a two - step excitation process with two lasers at 420 nm and 1013 nm , respectively .",
    "the first step laser is detuned sufficiently from the intermediate 6p state ( by about 2 ghz ) to ensure that the intermediate step is not populated on the timescale of the experiment ( for our scheme , this could lead to a two - step ionization ) .",
    "the laser at 1020 nm is focused to a waist of 80 microns , and the waist of the 420 nm laser can be varied between 6 and 40 microns , allowing us to change the overlap between the atomic clouds of size @xmath31 and the excitation lasers , and hence the effective excitation volume , which can be varied between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we note here that for the smallest waist of the 420 nm laser , the resulting excitation geometry is quasi one - dimensional since the waist of the laser is then smaller than the dipole blockade radius .",
    "the atomic clouds have peak densities around @xmath34 . after an excitation pulse of duration between 0.5 and 950 microseconds , during which the mot beams are switched off ,",
    "the rydberg atoms are field ionized by applying a voltage to electrodes located outside the vacuum chamber , and the resulting ions are accelerated towards a channeltron charge multiplier , whose output is recorded on an oscilloscope .",
    "the overall detection efficiency @xmath35 for the ions was determined to be around 40 percent .",
    "we extract information on the rydberg excitations present after a single excitation sequence by recording the channeltron signal due to the arrival of single ions on a digital oscilloscope and then using a peak - finding routine in order to determine the number of ions .",
    "this procedure is repeated up to @xmath36 times , and from the resulting counting distributions the mean @xmath37 as well as the @xmath38-th order central moments @xmath39 ( up to @xmath40 ) are calculated . from those moments , we also calculate the normalized quantities characterizing the distributions : mandel @xmath27-factor @xmath41 , skewness @xmath42 , binder cumulant @xmath43 and bimodality coefficient @xmath44 .",
    "we compare our experimental results to three simple models in order to highlight the main features of the dependence of the various quantities on @xmath37 : a perfectly monomodal and a poissonian monomodal model with mean @xmath45 and central moments @xmath46 for the perfectly monomodal model and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 for the poissonian model , as well as a bimodal model with two modes at @xmath51 and @xmath52 and probabilities @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the mean and the central moments for the bimodal model are @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "+ the finite detection efficiency @xmath35 in the experiment , which transforms the actual counting distribution @xmath57 into an observed counting distribution @xmath58 , is taken into account by using the analytical result @xmath59 for the @xmath38-th factorial moments @xcite and the relationship between the factorial and central moments given by @xcite @xmath60\\mu^i \\mu_j^f,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the stirling number of the second kind . the observed mean and the second , third and fourth central moments",
    "are then related to the actual moments by @xmath62\\mu_2+(3\\eta^4 - 6\\eta^3 + 3\\eta^2)\\mu^2 + \\nonumber \\\\&&+(-6\\eta^4 + 12\\eta^3 - 7\\eta^2+\\eta)\\mu\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which the observed values of the normalized quantities can be calculated ( for the mandel @xmath27-factor , the particularly simple result @xmath63 holds ) .",
    "alternatively , the above procedure can be used to calculate the actual moments and normalized quantities from the observed ones . +      the numerical simulations shown in fig .",
    "2 are based on an extension of the dicke model applied to rydberg excitations  @xcite which is explained in detail in the supplementary information .",
    "briefly , the original dicke model , based on the laser excitation conserving the cooperative character of the collective atomic wavefunctions , was modified by including the van - der - waals interactions between the collective dicke states , taking into account the @xmath64 contribution at short distances for @xmath65 states .",
    "the collective dicke states contain the full statistical information about the collective rydberg excitation and therefore allow the calculation of all the moments of the excitation statistics .",
    "the improved dicke model used here takes into account the time - dependent coupling between the dicke states , which becomes increasingly important as the number of rydberg excitations increases . for large excitation numbers the non - symmetric dicke states experience energy shifts and decoherence due to the van - der - waals interactions .",
    "these , in turn , lead to the asymmetric lineshapes and the characteristic histograms , featuring bimodal distributions for positive detuning , as shown in fig .",
    "the main elements of the dicke model describing the van - der - waals blockaded rydberg excitation of @xmath66 atoms have been exposed in @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the details of the revised model that are relevant for the features observed in the experiment .",
    "the dicke model is based on the laser excitation conserving the cooperative character of the collective atomic wavefunctions .",
    "the description of the system through the collective dicke states contains the full statistical information , not only the average quantities .",
    "all the moments of the excitation statistics can be calculated , in particular the measured full counting distributions of the rydberg excitations . in order to describe the experimental results presented in this paper the dicke model treatment",
    "was improved . as explained in @xcite , the introduction of an orthogonal basis for diagonalizing",
    "the van der waals basis coupling matrix in the restriction of the space of the non - fully symmetrical dicke states allow us to treat the evolution of the system with an single integro - differential equation for each symetrical dicke state with @xmath67 rydberg excitations @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the amplitude of the dicke state in the collective wave function , @xmath1 is the laser detuning , @xmath70 is the rabi frequency for the laser excitation and @xmath71 is the mean value of the van der waals interaction for the atoms in the symmetrical @xmath67 dicke state .",
    "the term @xmath72 in the equation corresponds to the mean field seen by the atoms .",
    "the term @xmath73  is a kernel function defined as@xmath74   \\exp\\left (   -iw_{qq}\\tau\\right )   \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath75 corresponds to the ensemble of the @xmath76 van der waals states with @xmath67 rydberg excitation and an energy @xmath77 .",
    "the evaluation of the kernel function is a crucial and non - trivial step in solving these equations @xcite . nevertheless , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that , to first approximation , the kernel function term firstly compensates the mean - field term and secondly acts as a coupling between the fully symmetrical @xmath67 dicke state and one particular virtual ad - hoc state with the same number of rydberg excitations , simulating the coupling with the ensemble of the non - symmetrical dicke states .",
    "this previous approach was limited to short interaction times @xmath78 and small numbers of rydberg excitations @xmath79 .",
    "the striking features of the collective dynamics appear at longer interaction times , when the organisation of the rydberg excitations within the ultracold cloud has reached a stationary state .",
    "a more complete treatment needs to take into account the time - dependent coupling between the different states , which becomes more and more important when @xmath79 increases .",
    "the kernel function depends on the distribution of the atoms inside the experimental sample .",
    "analytical solutions can be found for many configurations , but the exact solution of the equations is quite involved .",
    "it is easier , and more interesting for a physical understanding of the problem , to consider the fourier transform @xmath80 of the above kernel , which for a homogeneous atomic density is given to a good approximation by@xmath81 with the relation@xmath82 where @xmath83 is related to the volume of the atomic sample , @xmath84 corresponds to an effective minimum volume given by the mean distance between two atoms and @xmath85 is the van der waals coupling .",
    "this coupling can be estimated by taking into account the @xmath86 contribution at short distances for the @xmath65 states @xmath87 where we introduce an effective volume @xmath88 as@xmath89 @xmath90 corresponds to the minimum energy of @xmath67 rydberg atoms contained in the volume @xmath91 .",
    "it needs to be estimated for each @xmath67 .",
    "the general shape of the fourier transform function is shown in fig . 5 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is compared with a function calculated by considering an atomic density given by the expression@xmath94   \\exp\\left [   -\\frac{v_{x}^{2}}{v^{2}}-\\frac{v_{0}^{2}}{v_{x}^{2}}\\right ]   , \\label{atdensity}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the distance between two atoms .",
    "the choice of this density function , which is not far from a homogeneous atomic density in a volume @xmath91 , allows us to pursue the analytical approach by using the expression@xmath97   \\exp\\left [   -\\frac{\\omega_{vj\\max}}{\\omega}-\\frac { \\omega}{\\omega_{vj\\min}}\\right ]   \\frac{1}{\\omega^{3/2}}\\ ] ]    both functions exhibit three distinct parts corresponding to very different frequency ranges . for the high frequencies ( @xmath98 ) ,",
    "the shape of the function is broad , corresponding to a markovian short memory process , which in first approximation compensates the mean - field term .  for the low frequencies ( @xmath98 ) ,",
    "the function is much narrower , which characterizes a long memory process equivalent to the coupling to a bound state .  for the frequencies @xmath99 , which corresponds to the van der waals coupling value , the function is equal to zero . for large @xmath67 ,",
    "this behavior is slightly modified .",
    "the mean field term is partly restored , while the coupling to the the virtual state is decreased in amplitude .",
    "a decay term appears in the equations corresponding to a decoherence process for the non symmetrical dicke states .",
    "the state of the system corresponding to @xmath67 rydberg excitations is described by two differential equations@xmath100 and@xmath101 @xmath102 and @xmath103 are functions such as@xmath104 and@xmath105 @xmath106 is given by@xmath107 with @xmath108 .    at this point the dynamics of the system",
    "is no longer hamiltonian . in effect",
    ", we have introduced a decoherence process in the ensemble of the non - symmetrical states , which leads us to consider a population equation to conserve the ensemble of the atoms@xmath109   \\left\\vert b_{j}\\left (   t\\right )   \\right\\vert ^{2}.\\ ] ] the non coherent population with @xmath67 rydberg excitations corresponds to a total van - der - waals coupling energy of @xmath110 , which characterizes the global correlation of the system .",
    "the rydberg excitation of the incoherent and non - symmetrical dicke states is treated perturbatively through@xmath111 \\right ]   \\left\\vert b_{j}\\left (   t\\right )   \\right\\vert ^{2}-g(j)\\rho _ { j}+g\\left (   j-1\\right )   \\rho_{j-1}.\\ ] ]",
    "these equations depend on very few adjustable parameters , essentially the frequencies @xmath112  and @xmath113 , for which we can find reasonable estimates based on physical arguments . in the case of the @xmath65 states of rubidium which do not present any degeneracy ,",
    "the experimental parameters can be directly used .",
    "compared to the previous treatment in @xcite the dynamics of the evolution is taken into account more carefully and two important new features have been introduced .",
    "the first one is the decoherence in the evolution , and the second one is the appearance of the correlation corresponding to the energy of the virtual state .",
    "the rydberg excitation of the coherent non symmetrical state can be taken into account perturbatively , which does not introduce a fundamental change in the results of the calculations .",
    "we do not expect our model to perfectly reproduce the experimental results , as several details of the experiment ( inhomogeneous density of the cloud , other rydberg levels , decay from the excited state , finite velocity of the atoms ) are not taken into account . also , in our numerical simulations we found that the dynamics of the system depends on several parameters , a slight change of which leads to significatively different results .",
    "furthermore , for long excitation times the results depend sensitively on how we take into account the finite coherence time of the laser excitation .",
    "nevertheless , fig .",
    "2 in the main text shows that for a reasonable choice of parameters in the simulation , which are not too far from the parameters of the experiment , the results of the simulations agree quite well with the experimental data .",
    "in particular , agreement at the level of the full counting statistics ( histograms in fig .",
    "2 ( a - c ) ) is satisfactory .  for positive detuning",
    "the histogram exhibits a bimodal structure , while a single peak is essentially observed at resonance and very few atoms are excited for negative detuning .",
    "further information is obtained by analyzing the dynamics of the system .  on resonance the atoms",
    "are essentially described by the incoherent anti - symmetrical states , whereas for negative detuning only fully symmetrical dicke states are populated .  on resonance",
    "the evolution quickly becomes incoherent , and the system is described by a statistical mixture of states . for negative detuning , by contrast , the system is described by a superposition of a small number of dicke states with little excitation .",
    "interestingly , on resonance the total energy of the different non - coherent antisymmetrical states is low , meaning the system exhibits strong correlations .",
    "the histogram for positive detuning contains both components , resulting in @xmath114 statistical mixture of states and @xmath115 coherent superposition of dicke states .",
    "we also observe that for long excitation times the coherent antisymmetrical states are marginally populated for negative or positive detuning , while they remain present for much longer in the case of resonant excitation .",

    "<S> we have characterized the full counting statistics on resonance and for positive detuning over a range of rabi frequencies by analyzing the second , third and fourth central moments @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as the associated normalized quantities ( mandel @xmath27-factor , skewness , binder cumulant and bimodality coefficient ) as a function of the mean number . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 illustrates the main results of this analysis . </S>",
    "<S> figs . 3a and 3b show the off- and on - resonant counting distributions for two mean values ( the same in both graphs ) , illustrating the bimodality for off - resonant excitation and the sub - poissonian character of the distribution on resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this difference is clearly seen in the dependence of @xmath24 and the mandel @xmath27-factor on the mean number : whereas for on - resonant excitation those quantities are consistent with poissonian distributions for small mean numbers , they become increasingly mono - modal ( i.e. , strongly sub - poissonian ) for larger numbers as the system enters the fully blockaded regime . by contrast , in the off - resonant case @xmath24 initially _ increases _ with the mean , reaching a peak at about half the maximum number of excitations ( the mandel @xmath27-factor also exhibits a maximum , which is shifted to smaller numbers due to the normalization by the mean ) . as can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c - h , the results of the off - resonant case are in qualitative agreement with a simple bimodal model . in particular , we find that the bimodality coefficient ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3h ) of the off - resonant counting distributions is consistently higher ( at @xmath28 ) than for the resonant case ( around @xmath29 ) over the entire range of the mean number , emphasizing the qualitative difference between the two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> it is also obvious , however , that while the agreement is good for @xmath24 , the deviation increases for the higher central moments . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the usefulness of the full counting statistics , which allows comparisons with theoretical predictions that are far more sensitive than the mean and standard deviation alone . </S>",
    "<S> + the results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 can be interpreted in terms of a dynamical phase transition between a paramagnetic and an antiferromagnetic phase in a dissipative ising model with a transverse field , as shown recently in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although in those works the atoms are assumed to be arranged in a crystalline structure ( created by an optical lattice ) with regular spacing , the distance - selective resonance mechanism described above means that in our experiment the rydberg excitations should arrange themselves in a regular array with a spacing that depends on the detuning , as suggested theoretically in @xcite . in fig </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show a phase diagram for our system as a function of the rabi frequency and the detuning . the mean rydberg number as a function of the rabi frequency exhibits a smooth crossover between @xmath21 excitations and a maximum number of around @xmath30 excitations ( see also fig . 3a ) , where the position of the crossover depends on the detuning . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected from the analogy with an ising spin system @xcite , where the critical value of the transverse field ( which corresponds to the rabi frequency in our system ) increases with increasing ising interaction ( corresponding to the detuning in our case ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observe a distinct increase in the mandel @xmath27-factor in the transition region , which is compatible with the intermittent behaviour of the system theoretically predicted in @xcite ( and with our observation of bimodal counting statistics in that region ) , whereby in the transition region the active and inactive phases of the system coexist . in order to prove that interpretation directly , however , it will be necessary to observe the time evolution of a single experimental realization , e.g. , through the observation of photons emitted during the decay process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> +    in conclusion , we have analyzed resonant - and off - resonant rydberg excitations in a cold rubidium gas in the dissipative regime through full counting statistics . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the full counting statistics reveals characteristic features of the system that are not evident in the mean or standard deviation typically measured in such experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our technique should be useful for the characterization of rydberg excitations in optical lattices @xcite in which , e.g. , the ising model can be realized , and in experiments with chirped excitation lasers aimed at the adiabatic creation of rydberg crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the full counting statistics will be an important tool for unveiling many - body effects in rydberg excitations , for instance in quantum simulators . </S>"
