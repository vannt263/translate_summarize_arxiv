    "extremely red objects ( eros ) comprise stars , stellar remnants and galaxies .",
    "eros that are not galaxies include brown dwarfs and protostars , and have been studied ( e.g. @xcite ) at infrared @xmath6 magnitudes @xmath7 15 . at fainter magnitudes ,",
    "most eros are galaxies .",
    "use of the term  ero \" to describe both classes of objects is widespread , but to avoid confusion , we refer hereafter to the ero galaxies as extremely red galaxies ( ergs ) .",
    "they have very red colours ( @xmath5 , @xmath4 ) , and are thought to include members of two distinct populations ( e.g.   @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : dusty star - forming galaxies ( including some active galactic nuclei , agns ) and evolved ellipticals at @xmath8 . following the example of @xcite @xcite , we will refer to the dusty star - forming ergs as  dsfergs \" , and to the passively evolving ergs as  pergs \" . the relative mix of the two populations , which is a function of magnitude , colour and redshift , has not been well constrained in the literature , although progress has been made ( e.g.   @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the red colours in dsfergs are caused by dust absorbing shorter wavelength light and in pergs by old stellar populations .",
    "different models of galaxy evolution  monolithic collapse with passive luminosity evolution ( ple ) versus hierarchical merging in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology  predict different properties for galaxy populations .",
    "these involve differences in the formation scenario for ellipticals , and in the evolution of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "the hierarchical merging model predicts that the number of ellipticals should increase with time , as they form through the merging of spiral or irregular systems .",
    "@xcite found that a high fraction of red galaxies , corresponding to redshifts @xmath9 , was at least as consistent with ple as with cdm merger models .",
    "scodeggio & silva @xcite found that the space density of ergs was consistent with no change in the volume density of ellipticals from @xmath10 to 1.5 .",
    "however , rodighiero et al .",
    "@xcite found evidence for cdm merger models in the form of a decrease in the density of e / s0 galaxies between @xmath11 and 1.5 , with a corresponding drop in the density of ergs .",
    "a characteristic limitation of these early erg surveys was large field - to - field variations in erg density ( e.g.  @xcite compared with @xcite ) .",
    "this is largely a result of cosmic variance , but is also related to survey sensitivity and how the erg class is defined ( @xcite ) .",
    "erg density is a strong function of both the survey depth and the colour threshold used to define the erg population .",
    "ergs include galaxies that formed at high redshift and evolved passively since then ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "for example , spinrad et al .",
    "@xcite studied a perg at @xmath12 , estimating that it had a formation redshift @xmath13 and identifying it as possibly the oldest galaxy known at @xmath8 .",
    "the detection of highly evolved ellipticals at @xmath14 by bentez et al .",
    "@xcite , with a corresponding lack of luminous blue ellipticals , also implied a formation redshift for ellipticals of @xmath13 .",
    "from ergs in the k20 survey , cimatti et al .",
    "@xcite deduce a minimum formation redshift of about 2 for pergs at @xmath15 , and a significant range for the formation redshift of about 2.2 to 4 .",
    "even though the evolution of the star - formation rate ( sfr ) in different environments has not been comprehensively constrained ( e.g.  @xcite ) , it is clear that the lowest sfrs in the nearby universe , found in high mass elliptical galaxies , were the sites of the highest sfrs in the distant past .",
    "smail et al .",
    "@xcite suggest that the most extreme ergs are mainly of the dusty star - forming variety , and that studying the dsferg population may tell us much about the nature of star formation in the early universe .",
    "measurement of the densities of pergs may therefore be used to test models of galaxy evolution in terms of the mass assembly of galaxies , with the clustering properties of both pergs and dsfergs being used to test the clustering predictions of these scenarios .",
    "the importance of ergs for such tests is emphasized by georgakakis et al .",
    "@xcite , who find that ergs contribute almost half the stellar mass density of the universe at @xmath15 .",
    "furthermore , both erg classes may provide valuable information about the formation of the earliest galaxies and clusters .",
    "faint radio sources are also considered to identify clusters ( e.g. best @xcite , buttery et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but it has not been conclusively shown that ergs and faint radio sources trace similar structures at high redshift ( georgakakis et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    in this paper , we present the results of a moderately deep near - infrared @xmath16 survey ( section 2 ) covering @xmath17 arcmin@xmath18 in the phoenix deep survey region .",

    "our corresponding erg sample , defined in section 3 , is about the same numerical size as that studied by georgakakis et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our erg sample is complemented by deep radio data , which we use to examine the association of ergs and radio sources .",
    "deep multiwavelength coverage allows us to investigate differences in clustering properties which may be introduced by different erg selection criteria .",
    "we examine the environments and clustering of our sample in sections 4 and 5 , focussing on a possible cluster at @xmath3 in section 6 .",
    "where necessary in this work , we have adopted a concordance cosmological model with @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the conditions were photometric , with seeing ranging from @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "we observed 11 ispi pointings using a random dither pattern , nine with a total exposure time of 30minutes , and the remaining two with exposure times of 21 and 15minutes .",
    "image processing was performed using standard noao iraf routines .",
    "dark frames were subtracted from each image , as were running sky flats , constructed from medians of up to 10 object frames .",

    "the final astrometry was done by reference to 2mass ( @xcite ) source positions .",
    "residual offsets with respect to 2mass positions , and to fainter pds sources in @xmath28-band images , were fitted by a gaussian with @xmath37 .",
    "we employed sextractor on each of the eleven @xmath16-band images using their respective exposure maps as weight images , with a detection threshold of 1.5 times the noise level .",
    "the low signal - to - noise regions on the edges of the co - added images , a result of the dithering of individual exposures , are excluded with simple right ascension and declination cuts .",
    "the overlap between the images was such that we were able to maintain contiguity throughout the area of our @xmath16-band survey .",
    "the final catalogue contains 4834 objects . within the area of our catalogue",
    ", there are 230 sources , mostly stars , which also have 2mass identifications . for each individual image",
    ", we tied our photometry to 2mass by adjusting the magnitude zeropoints in our sextractor input to give the tightest correlation between ispi and 2mass magnitudes ( see figure [ phoenixand2mass ] ) .    following schmidt et al .",
    "@xcite , we performed star - galaxy separation by comparing sextractor s fixed aperture ( @xmath38 diameter ) magnitude with its mag_auto magnitude , after which we used mag_auto for all subsequent analysis .",
    "our @xmath16-band galaxy counts shown in figure [ galaxycounts ] are consistent with other recent measurements .",
    "the completeness of the catalogue was estimated to be 80% to @xmath39 from comparison with source counts from kong et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "we matched our near - infrared catalogue with the existing optical catalogue ( @xcite ) , counting objects within 2@xmath40 as matches .",
    "we constructed two samples of ergs based on the two - colour criteria : @xmath5 and @xmath4 .",
    "this resulted in a sample of 375 @xmath41-selected ergs , 273 of which are brighter than @xmath0 .",

    "ergs with more extreme colours close to the @xmath16-band detection limit may not be detected in @xmath28-band , and will therefore contribute to the incompleteness seen in figure [ ergnumcounts ] .      to characterize the clustering properties of this erg sample",
    ", we use the two - point angular correlation function .",

    "@xcite , assuming the correlation function slope @xmath46 , which gives @xmath47 for our survey area .    in figure [ corfs ] we present the correlation functions for the ergs from our data .",
    "we find significant clustering for limiting @xmath16 magnitudes between 18 and 18.5 ( table [ clusteringamplitudetable ] ) .",
    "the clustering amplitudes for our erg sample are consistent with other recent measurements ( figure [ clusteringamplitudes ] ) , and are much greater than the amplitudes which have been measured for all @xmath16-band galaxies to the same limiting magnitudes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "there appears to be a difference between the clustering properties of the ergs selected by our two different criteria . in table",
    "[ clusteringamplitudetable ] , at each limiting magnitude , the clustering amplitude and confidence level of the clustering signal for ergs selected using the @xmath41 criterion is greater than that found using @xmath48 selection .",
    "this is also seen in figure [ corfs ] , supporting the suggestion ( visnen & johansson @xcite ) that @xmath48 selection may be more sensitive to the dsferg population , as these galaxies are expected to cluster less strongly than the pergs .",
    "we stress that differences in the redshift distributions of ergs selected by the different colour criteria are likely to affect their measured clustering properties .",
    "observed - frame colour tracks given by mccarthy @xcite show that the @xmath41 criterion should , in principle , be more efficient at selecting passively evolving ergs .",
    "studying the association of ergs with @xmath16-band galaxies and faint radio sources is valuable in understanding their nature . for this analysis",
    "we have used the erg sample selected with @xmath5 .",
    "our estimation of the cross - correlation between @xmath16-band galaxies and ergs reveals no significant association .",

    "@xcite find that ergs are only associated with overdensities of @xmath16-band galaxies at @xmath51 .    to compare the erg and faint radio source populations , we first make use of the publicly available code    hyperz    ( @xcite ) to find photometric redshifts for all galaxies detected in at least three of the _",
    "ubvrik@xmath52 _ bands . in figure [ ergpzbincoarse ]",
    "we have shown the photometric redshift distribution for @xmath53 ergs only .",
    "we then match our radio catalogue with the galaxies ( including non - ergs ) for which we have photometric redshifts , dividing the radio sources into two broad redshift ranges .",
    "faint radio sources individually associated with ergs are excluded , and cross - correlation functions are estimated ( e.g. georgakakis et al .",
    "@xcite ) to compare the two radio samples with the erg catalogue .",
    "figure [ radiozerg ] , in which bootstrap errors are shown ( barrow , bhavsar & sonoda  @xcite ) , demonstrates that while there is no significant correlation between the positions of ergs and faint radio sources with counterparts at @xmath54 , there is such a correlation at the @xmath55 confidence level for the radio sources with counterparts at @xmath56 .",
    "georgakakis et al .",
    "@xcite also detect such a correlation at the @xmath57 confidence level .",
    "our work supports the conclusion that at higher redshifts ( @xmath58 ) , ergs and radio sources are associated .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising since the redshift distributions of both samples peak at @xmath15 ( condon @xcite , mccarthy @xcite ) .",
    "since we have eliminated faint radio sources individually associated with ergs , this can not simply be the result of one - to - one associations .",
    "if ergs and radio sources trace galaxy overdensities at higher redshift , we should be able to detect strong association between the two populations in high redshift cluster environments . in the next section we search for this effect .",
    "rich clusters at high redshifts contain massive , red elliptical galaxies at their cores , which can show up as erg overdensities a few arcminutes across in erg surveys ( e.g.  stanford et al .",
    "@xcite , roche et al .",
    "@xcite , daz - snchez et al .",
    "studies of such cluster samples may be used to investigate how the highest density regions of the universe have evolved , and possibly place constraints on their formation .    here",
    "we identify cluster candidates in two different ways .",
    "first , we use a simple counts - in - cells criterion , and second , we use an overdensity - mapping algorithm .",
    "the former technique gives us a set of likely candidates , and the latter technique allows us to treat cluster environments statistically .      for the entire area of our survey",
    "we have found local counts of ergs within circles of radius 50 arcseconds , and identified six locations ( figure [ sighting ] ) which contain six or more ergs within a circle of radius 50 arcseconds ( see also blake & wall  @xcite ) . given a uniform random field with the same mean density as our erg catalogue , the probability of a particular location hosting such an overdensity is 3.8 @xmath59 10@xmath60 .",
    "this criterion selects locations hosting the highest densities and is intended to identify overdensities with the highest probability of physical significance .",
    "daz - snchez et al .",
    "@xcite report one such overdensity as a cluster at @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ radioclusterenvirons ] shows the distribution of faint radio sources in these cluster environments , for the same redshift ranges used in figure [ radiozerg ] .",
    "one might expect from the statistically significant result for @xmath61 in figure [ radiozerg ] that there should also be an excess of associated radio sources in the regions with erg overdensities .",
    "however , we find only a 1.05@xmath33 excess of faint radio sources in these putative clusters .",
    "this may be because the ergs in these high density regions are pergs which have fewer radio counterparts since they have lower star - formation rates .",
    "we now describe an algorithm we have developed to identify overdensities of ergs within our survey area , beginning with a general description before explaining the procedure in detail . for",
    "any given location , we compare the local galaxy count with the distribution of counts expected from a large set of uniform random catalogues , each with the same mean density as the erg catalogue .",
    "this comparison allows us to calculate the probability that the local area contains a greater number of galaxies than that expected from a random distribution . repeating this process for a range of specific radii",
    ", we form a _ probability function _ which is then associated with the location . similarly , a probability function is assigned to each of a set of uniformly spaced locations within our survey .",
    "the optimal range and resolution of the radii and locations sampled may be found empirically .",
    "each probability function is used to estimate the probability of the count within each radius enclosing its location occurring as the result of a uniform random distribution .",
    "if the probability of obtaining the local count from a random catalogue is high , the value of the probability function will be close to a half , since the number of random catalogues with lower counts will be similar to the number with higher counts . in the presence of a genuine overdensity ,",
    "the probability function will rise above 0.5 and continue to ascend with increasing radius ( since the probability of a large overdensity is lower than the probability of a small one ) until the  edge \" of the overdensity has been reached . beyond this edge",
    ", the enclosed density will fall back to the background density , and the probability function will approach 0.5 .",
    "hence , we expect each probability function to be sensitive to both the significance and scale of any nearby overdensities , characterised by its maximum and the radius at which it occurs .    for overdensities centred on particular catalogue objects ,",
    "this maximum occurs at a radius of zero ( which thus encloses an infinite density ) , but we negate this by specifying a minimum overdensity membership of two .",
    "we define the radius at which the maximum occurs as the _ overdensity radius _ , and the _ overdensity probability _ as the value which the probability function takes at the overdensity radius .",
    "our technique uses probability to compare between scales in order to select the most likely scale at which each particular location hosts an overdensity .    to achieve this",
    ", we follow these steps .    *",
    "the survey area is covered with a uniform grid of test points at intervals of 20 arcseconds along both right ascension and declination .",
    "* we populate the survey area with a large number of random sets , each containing the same average density of points as the erg catalogue that we are examining . *",
    "we count the number of ergs and random objects ( in each random set ) as a function of distance from each test point , in steps of 10 arcseconds from 20 to 120 arcseconds . *",
    "the probability of overdensity is then the fraction of random sets for which the number of erg counts exceeds the number of random counts .",
    "erg counts consistent with uniform random distribution will therefore produce overdensity probabilities of 0.5 .    in overdense regions ,",
    "the overdensity probability directly quantifies the probability that the local environment is associated with an overdensity , and the overdensity radius directly characterizes the scale size of this structure .",
    "each of the grid points which we test within our catalogue will have an associated overdensity probability and overdensity radius . by confining our random sets to the area of the catalogue under inspection",
    ", we account for edge effects .",
    "the probability of overdensity is intimately connected with the overdensity radius .",
    "we are effectively sensitive to multi - scale structure throughout the survey area , meaning that we will detect both high density small - scale features ( which might be overlooked in the case of simple large - scale smoothing ) , and extended regions of intermediate density ( which might be overlooked in the case of simple small - scale smoothing ) .",
    "our algorithm is therefore sensitive to overdensities spanning a wide range of scales .",
    "in particular it has the potential to simultaneously identify filamentary structures as well as clusters , an aspect that we will explore in detail in future work .",
    "figure [ rkssmoothrksergs ] shows the result of the overdensity - mapping algorithm applied to our data .",
    "it is clear that the regions identified by our algorithm as having a high overdensity probability do indeed correspond to visual overdensities of ergs , and similarly that regions with no ergs , or isolated ergs , have low probability .      in figure [ rkssmoothzradio ]",
    "we visually compare the overdensity probability map in figure [ rkssmoothrksergs ] with the distribution of faint radio sources in the two @xmath62 ranges previously defined .",
    "the redshift dependence shown in figure [ radiozerg ] is not apparent in figure [ rkssmoothzradio ] .",
    "we stress , however , that since our algorithm has smoothed the predominantly @xmath15 erg population , the overdensity map will be biased towards structures at this redshift .",
    "we have matched each of the faint radio sources with the pixel ( from our overdensity map ) closest to its position , and counted the frequency with which faint radio sources are matched with certain pixel values .",
    "effectively , what we are doing here is counting the number of faint radio sources which lie along different probability contours of our overdensity map .",
    "the result of this analysis is shown in figure [ smoothhistpzradio ] , which suggests that faint radio sources with optical counterparts with @xmath56 are indeed found in high density regions , with a 2@xmath33 excess for overdensity probabilities between 0.9 and 1 .",
    "this is not seen in the @xmath54 sample .",
    "while the statistics are poor , and our overdensity map is strongly biased towards higher redshifts ( as shown in figure [ ergpzbincoarse ] ) , figure [ smoothhistpzradio ] tentatively suggests that clusters at high redshift are more likely to host faint radio sources in their central regions .",
    "the lack of a clear association of ergs and radio sources with optical counterparts with @xmath56 evident in figure [ rkssmoothzradio ] and the result from figure [ radioclusterenvirons ] suggests that the correlation between ergs and moderately high redshift radio sources implied by figure [ radiozerg ] does not occur in regions with the highest erg densities .",
    "figure [ radiozerg ] shows association on scales which may not be noticeable when considering the scale of the entire field shown in figure [ rkssmoothzradio ] , and can not be used to draw conclusions about the characteristic density of the environment in which ergs and faint radio sources are associated .",
    "figure [ smoothhistpzradio ] illustrates , however , that our overdensity map provides a way of directly probing this characteristic density .",
    "of the cluster candidates identified via the counts - in - cells criterion ( figure [ sighting ] ) , we have singled out one in particular as an interesting object for future study .",
    "@xmath16-band and @xmath28-band images of this putative cluster are shown in figure [ clusterpics ] , with atca 1.4ghz contours overlaid .",
    "astrometry for both images was referenced to 810 stars in the supercosmos ( hambly et al .",

    "the relative proportions of starburst galaxies and agns in the faint radio population are strongly model dependent ( e.g. seymour et al .",
    "@xcite , hopkins @xcite ) , although recent observations ( seymour et al .",
    "@xcite ) indicate that star - forming galaxies at this flux density are more numerous than agns by a factor of 2 to 3 .",
    "figure @xmath67 shows that the central radio source has a nearby companion radio source , pdfj011053.4@xmath64454351 , associated with a faint @xmath68-band object that falls below our catalogue threshold .",
    "figure [ clustercolourmag ] shows there are six objects in this possible cluster with @xmath69 . since",
    "such extreme colours are caused primarily by redshift , the cluster is likely to lie at @xmath3 but not much greater , given the depth of our @xmath68 survey . if it lies at @xmath70 , the radio luminosity of the central erg is @xmath71whz@xmath20 , making it a low - luminosity agn . as the brightest galaxy in this field ,",
    "it is also consistent with being the central dominant cluster galaxy .",
    "an 80 @xmath24jy radio source to the west ( pdfj011052.0@xmath64454338 ) is also shown in figure @xmath67 , with contours suggestive of a head - tail morphology .",
    "tailed radio galaxies are often seen in galaxy clusters ( e.g.  gomez et al .",
    "@xcite , sakelliou & merrifield @xcite , klamer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but its @xmath72 magnitude and clear separation from the red locus in figure [ clustercolourmag ] point to it belonging to the foreground cluster evident in the @xmath28-band image .",

    "however , the radial extent of the cluster is likely to be underestimated because of our relatively bright @xmath68-band limiting magnitude .",
    "the presence of radio sources within our empirically determined radial extent suggests that this estimate is consistent with the core radius of 167 kpc found for nearby clusters , based on their radio source distribution ( ledlow & owen  @xcite ) .",

    "the identification of the cluster candidates in this study shows that ergs can be used to identify overdensities of potential physical significance , and our 2.3@xmath33 result for the association of ergs and faint radio sources at @xmath56 is evidence that both classes of objects trace overdense regions .",
