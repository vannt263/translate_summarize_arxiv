    "two interesting papers by lagarias and maddock @xcite use novel notions of ` local level sets ' and a ` takagi singular function ' to establish several properties of the level sets of @xmath18 .",
    "for instance , it is shown in @xcite that the set of @xmath17-values for which @xmath16 has strictly positive hausdorff dimension is a set of full hausdorff dimension 1 .    in this article",
    "we examine the level sets of a class of generalized takagi functions of the form @xmath22 where @xmath23 observe that @xmath5 can jump only at points @xmath3 where @xmath24 , so the terms of the series in are continuous . as a result , @xmath11 is a continuous function .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the class of all functions @xmath11 of the form , and by @xmath26 the subclass of those @xmath11 in @xmath25 for which @xmath5 is constant for each @xmath4 .",
    "the class @xmath25 was investigated in detail by abbott , anderson and pitt @xcite , who denoted it by @xmath27 because of its relationship with zygmund s class @xmath28 of quasi - smooth functions .",
    "but whereas @xcite studies the class @xmath25 from the perspective of abscissa or @xmath3-values , our focus here is on ordinate or @xmath17-values .",
