    "magnetic vortices in the mixed state of high-@xmath7 superconductors in the presence of defects  either localized point pinning centers , such as oxygen vacancies or extended columnar pins introduced into the material via high - energy ion irradiation  offer a complex system which has attracted the attention of both experimentalist and theorists from various disciplines of physics in recent years @xcite .",
    "this area of research is also inspired by important technological questions triggered by the search for effective pinning centers in order to minimize dissipation when current is passed through the superconductor @xcite . from a more fundamental viewpoint ,",
    "one is interested in the non - equilibrium dynamics of a disordered flux line system . when subject to an external electric current , non - trivial steady states are generated which can be directly probed experimentally .",
    "for example , the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics @xcite , the voltage noise power spectrum @xcite , or the local flux density noise @xcite measured in experiments bear important signatures of the different non - equilibrium steady states . at low currents , transport can take place due to thermally activated ` tunneling ' of flux lines through the defects @xcite , while at larger currents various intriguing steady states have been proposed , such as plastic flow where flux lines move in channels @xcite . with increasing current the flux lines tend to reorder and move in a lattice ( moving bragg glass for point vortices @xcite ) , or the channels in the plastic flow regime can organize in a periodic structure ( smectic phase ) in the transverse direction of the external current @xcite .",
    "the presence of such steady states is reflected in the voltage noise spectrum ; e.g. , reordering would give rise to characteristic ` washboard ' noise features .",
    "recent experiments have in fact demonstrated the presence of both narrow- and broad - band noise in the measured voltage and local flux density spectra @xcite .",
    "our goal is in addition to study how these noise spectra depend on the type of defects ( correlated or point - like ) present in the sample .",
    "however , since analytical studies of the vortex dynamics are usually limited to asymptotic regimes @xcite where the current @xmath8 is either much smaller or much larger than the critical current @xmath0 , one needs to resort to either langevin molecular dynamics simulations @xcite or monte carlo techniques @xcite to study the various non - equibrium steady states which occur in the intermediate current regime . owing to their complexity",
    ", these numerical simulations are largely restricted to two dimensions @xcite and very few three - dimensional studies have been reported @xcite . in this article",
    "we present the results of fully three - dimensional monte carlo simulations of interacting magnetic vortex lines in the presence of columnar defects .",
    "we investigate the effects of the repulsive forces between the flux lines and their interactions with extended defects in the i - v characteristics and the voltage noise spectrum , focusing on those aspects which are inaccessible by two - dimensional simulations .",

    "the repulsive interaction energy between the flux lines is approximated to be local in the @xmath26 coordinate , in accord with the london limit .",
    "it is represented by the second term in ( [ ham ] ) , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the modified bessel function which varies as @xmath29 when @xmath30 and @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",

    "the cylindrical wells are oriented parallel to the * c * axis .",
    "we investigate the dynamics for three different distributions of defects , namely , ( i ) columnar pins either distributed randomly , or ( ii ) arranged in a square lattice in the @xmath55 plane , and ( iii ) point defects distributed randomly in the sample . since in the presence of weak currents @xmath56 the flux lines locally move according to equilibrium dynamics , one may incorporate the effect of the force in the mc by introducing an additional work term @xmath57 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) @xcite .    to initiate the simulation , flux lines of straight configurations parallel to the @xmath58 axis are nucleated at random positions in the @xmath55 plane .",
    "we then let the system equilibrate .",
    "once equilibrium has been reached we turn on the external current and let the system evolve .",
    "we have checked that the results in the steady state are independent of the initial configurations . at each trial a randomly chosen point on the line is updated according to a metropolis algorithm @xcite .",

    "is applied the nearly localized vortices ( since @xmath88 the flux lines rarely tunnel through the defects ) in the glassy phases start moving once a critical driving current is reached . at @xmath89 , and in the absence of mutual vortex interactions , the flux lines are strictly bound to one or more pins in equilibrium . at the critical depinning current @xmath90 one then encounters a continuous non - equilibrium phase transition @xcite .",
    "this zero - temperature phase transition becomes rounded to a crossover at @xmath91 , but a characteristic ` critical ' current separating the localized and moving vortex regimes can still be inferred at sufficiently low temperatures , as seen in the i - v characteristics displayed in fig .",
    "[ iv ] , which were computed at @xmath92 .",
    "it turns out that the critical current @xmath0 is actually higher for a system with columnar pins as compared to point disorder because of the increased defect correlations @xcite .",

    "repulsive interactions between the flux lines facilitate flux creep which is reflected in the delocalization of the vortices at a considerably lower current than for the non - interacting case ( fig .",
    "the i - v characteristics also reveal that the voltage at the same current is higher for the system with a random as compared to periodic defect distribution .",
    "similar behavior is observed in the dynamics of the single flux line , and can be qualitatively explained by an effectively faster transit time in the random pin distribution compared to the periodic columnar defect array @xcite .",
    "we have also found that in the system with a single flux line in the presence of a periodic pin arrangement the i - v characteristics depends strongly on the orientation of * j * with respect to the lattice direction , for this determines the effective density of defects encountered by the moving vortex .",

    "the peaks occur at the same scaled frequency @xmath112 .",

    "notice the presence of secondary peaks in the spectrum ( see text ) . ]    for currents @xmath86 , three distinct time scales can appear in the dynamics : the residence time @xmath113 which is the duration a vortex line is trapped on the defects , @xmath114 , the time taken by the flux line to travel between the pins , and @xmath115 , the time taken by the moving vortex lattice in the event of reordering to traverse a distance of the lattice constant . in the regime where these time scales are well separated and @xmath116 , as well as @xmath117 , we can expect @xmath114 and @xmath115 to produce pronounced peaks in the velocity noise spectrum .",
    "we first summarize the results from the non - interacting case where the time scale @xmath115 is entirely absent ( stick - slip motion ) . in fig .",
    "[ pernoi](a ) we plot @xmath1 at different driving currents for a periodic distribution of columnar pins .",
    "the spectra reveal a single peak corresponding to the frequency @xmath118 .",
    "note that the width of the peak decreases as the external current @xmath40 increases , which widens the time scale separation between @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in a random defect distribution , see fig .",
    "[ pernoi](b ) , there would be a distribution of the time scales @xmath114 around the average value @xmath119 .",
    "therefore there could be many secondary peaks present in the spectrum arising due to the distribution of @xmath114 in addition to the principle peak which corresponds to @xmath120 .",
    "these secondary peaks would eventually diminish in intensity as the distribution of the time scales will narrow down at @xmath119 with the results averaged over more defect configurations .",
    "unlike for correlated defects , the time scales @xmath113 and @xmath114 are not well separated for point pins and the peaks turns out to be considerably suppressed as compared to the situation for columnar defects @xcite .",
    "plot of the velocity noise spectrum @xmath1 vs. @xmath108 for a system of periodically arranged columnar pins at @xmath110 with interacting flux lines .",
    "the primary peak corresponds to the rescaled frequency @xmath112 . ]",
    "the presence of interactions between the flux lines may introduce the third time scale @xmath115 if the vortex lines align themselves into a lattice structure at large external currents .",
    "for example the predicted moving vortex lattice ( in the presence of point defects ) @xcite would give rise to a distinct @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the lattice constant of the moving flux line array .",
    "we have not yet detected any signature of the corresponding narrow - band noise in the presence of columnar defects with periodic spatial distribution , even when the average distance between the flux lines is much less than the periodicity of the pins .",
    "this implies absence of reordering in the observed range of external currents . we do find a peak in @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath123 ( fig .  [ ints ] ) which is also observed in the non - interacting case",
    "however we might expect reordering when the density of the flux lines is larger than the defect density because then the effect of defect correlations becomes masked .    we have noticed a marked difference in @xmath1 between columnar and point pins which results from the lack of spatial correlation in the @xmath26 direction for the point disorder .",
    "notice that this distinction can be observed only in a three - dimensional dynamical simulation .",
    "it is due to a generic difference between correlated and localized pinning potentials .",
    "the ensuing absence or presence of the narrow - band noise peaks in the voltage noise spectrum @xmath1 , and its specific features , could perhaps be utilized as a signature to identify and characterize the type of disorder present and responsible for flux pinning in experimental superconducting samples as well .",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the three - dimensional dynamics of interacting flux lines in the presence of correlated defects , either arranged in a periodic array or placed randomly in space .",
    "we find that the nature of the current - voltage characteristics depends on the defect correlation as well as the spatial distribution of the pinning centers .",
    "the voltage noise spectrum shows pronounced peaks in the case of correlated pins .",
    "the difference in the power spectra at @xmath86 between columnar and point disorder may serve as a novel diagnostic tool to characterize the pinning centers in superconducting samples .",
