    "according to the prevailing interpretation , our universe is dynamically dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath1 ( or a dynamical equivalent , called dark energy ( de ) ) which contributes more than 70% to the total cosmic energy budget .",
    "more than 20% are contributed by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and only about 5% are in the form of conventional , baryonic matter .",
    "because of the cosmological constant problem in its different facets , including the coincidence problem , a great deal of work was devoted to alternative approaches in which a similar dynamics as that of the @xmath1cdm model is reproduced with a time varying cosmological term , i.e. , the cosmological constant is replaced by a dynamical quantity . both dark matter ( dm ) and",
    "de manifest themselves so far only through their gravitational interaction .",
    "this provides a motivation for approaches in which dm and de appear as different manifestation of one single dark - sector component .",
    "the chaplygin - gas model and its different generalizations realize this idea . unified models of the dark sector of this type are attractive since one and the same component behaves as pressureless matter at high redshifts and as a cosmological constant in the long time limit . while the homogeneous and isotropic background dynamics for the ( generalized ) chaplygin gas ( gcg ) is well compatible with the data , the study of the perturbation dynamics resulted in problems which apparently ruled out all chaplygin - gas type models except those that are observationally almost indistinguishable from the @xmath1cdm model . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "nonadiabatic perturbations were postulated and designed in a way to make the effective sound speed vanish . but this amounts to an ad hoc procedure which leaves open the physical origin of nonadiabatic perturbations",
    ". there exists , however , a different type of unified models of the dark sector , namely viscous cosmological models , which are intrinsically nonadiabatic @xcite . in the homogeneous and isotropic background a one - component viscous fluid shares the same dynamics as a gcg .",
    "now , what is observed in the redshift surveys is not the spectrum of the dark - matter distribution but the baryonic matter spectrum . including a baryon component into the perturbation dynamics for a universe with a chaplygin - gas dark sector",
    ", there appears the new problem that the unified chaplygin - gas scenario itself is disfavored by the data .",
    "it is only if the unified scenario with a fixed pressureless ( supposedly ) baryonic matter fraction of about @xmath2 ( according to the results from wmap and primordial nucleosynthesis ) is _ imposed _ on the dynamics , that consistency with the data is obtained @xcite . if the pressureless matter fraction is left free , its best - fit value is much larger than the baryonic fraction .",
    "in fact it becomes even close to unity , leaving only a small percentage for the chaplygin gas , thus invalidating the entire scenario .",
    "in other words , a chaplygin - gas - based unified model of the dark sector is difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "one may ask now , whether the status of unified models can again be remedied by replacing the chaplygin gas by a viscous fluid .",
    "it is exactly this question that we are going to investigate in the present paper .",
    "it is our purpose to study cosmological perturbations for a two - component model of baryons and a viscous fluid , where the latter represents a one - component description of the dark sector @xcite .",
    "we shall show that such type of unified model is not only consistent for a fixed fraction of the baryons but also for the case that the matter fraction is left free .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the statistically preferred value for the abundance of pressureless matter is compatible with the mentioned baryon fraction @xmath2 that follows from the synthesis of light elements .",
    "the cosmic medium is assumed to be describable by an energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 which splits into a matter part @xmath4 and viscous fluid part @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 where the subscript  m \" stands for matter and the subscript  v \" stands for viscous . the total cosmic fluid is characterized by a four velocity @xmath8 while @xmath9 represents the four velocity of the matter part and @xmath10 represents the four velocity of the viscous fluid .",
    "energy - momentum conservation is supposed to hold separately for each of the components , @xmath11 let the matter be pressureless , i.e. @xmath12 and the viscous fluid be characterized by a bulk viscous pressure @xmath13 , where @xmath14 const and @xmath15 is the fluid expansion . under this condition",
    "the total pressure coincides with the pressure of the viscous component . in terms of the present value @xmath16 of the deceleration parameter the hubble rate can be written as @xcite @xmath17\\ , \\label{r / r0q}\\ ] ] which coincides with the hubble rate of a specific ( @xmath18 ) gcg . since @xmath19",
    ", we have @xmath20 .",
    "it is the total energy density that behaves as a gcg , not the component @xmath21 .",
    "this type of unified model differs from unified models in which the total energy density is the sum of a gcg and a baryon component .",
    "only if the baryon component is ignored , both descriptions coincide .",
    "consequently , in the homogeneous and isotropic background , a generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath18 can be seen as a unified description of the cosmic medium , consisting of a separately conserved matter component and a bulk viscous fluid with @xmath14 const , where the latter itself represents a unified model of the dark sector .",
    "the nonadiabaticity of the system as a whole is characterized by @xmath22 the quantity ( [ p- ] ) is governed by the dynamics of the total energy - density perturbation @xmath23 and by the perturbations @xmath24 of the expansion scalar , which is also a quantity that characterizes the system as a whole .",
    "the behavior of these quantities is described by the energy - momentum conservation for the entire system and by the raychaudhuri equation , respectively .",
    "both of these equations are coupled to each other .",
    "the remarkable point is that these quantities and , consequently , the total energy density perturbation , are independent of the two - component structure of the medium . the reason is the direct relation @xmath25 between the pressure perturbations and the perturbations of the expansion scalar .",
    "it is convenient to describe the perturbation dynamics in terms of gauge invariant quantities which represent perturbations on comoving hypersurfaces , indicated by a superscript @xmath26 .",
    "these are defined as ( @xmath27 is the velocity potential , defined by @xmath28 ) @xmath29 then , in linear order , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 are given by explicitly known background quantities @xcite .",
    "the relative entropy perturbations are defined by @xmath34 and obey the equation @xmath35 again , the coefficients @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are combinations of analytically given background variables @xcite . the quantity relevant for the observations is the fractional perturbation @xmath40 of the energy density of the baryons , given by @xmath41 \\ .",
    "\\label{del1}\\ ] ] at early times , i.e. for small scale factors @xmath42 , the equation ( [ dddshort ] ) has the asymptotic form @xmath43 independent of @xmath44 and for all scales .",
    "( [ pps ] ) then reduces to @xmath45 with the solution @xmath46 const @xmath47 . consequently , there are neither nonadiabatic contributions to the total energy - density fluctuations nor relative entropy perturbations and we have purely adiabatic perturbations @xmath48 at @xmath42 .",
    "this allows us to match the initial conditions for equations ( [ dddshort ] ) and ( [ pps ] ) with those of the @xmath1cdm model at early times .",
    "the results of our statistical analysis are shown in fig .",

    "the approach presented here is based on the fact that the two - component system of a bulk viscous fluid and a separately conserved baryon component behaves in the background as a generalized chaplygin gas with @xmath49 . while the baryon component may be considered dynamically negligible in the background ,",
    "the situation is different on the perturbative level , since the observed matter agglomerations are related to baryonic density fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations are obtained from a combination of the nonadiabatic total energy density perturbations and relative entropy perturbations in the two - component system where the former source the latter .",
    "the probability distribution for the deceleration parameter has a maximum at @xmath50 which partially removes the degeneracy of previous studies which , taken at face value , were incompatible with an accelerated expansion and thus in obvious tension with results for the background . perhaps still more important",
    "is the test of the unified model itself .",
    "many investigations on approaches with a unified dark sector fix the pressureless matter component to be that of the favored ( by the wmap data ) baryon fraction and then check whether or not the resulting dynamics can reproduce the observations . but this does not say anything on how probable the division of the total cosmic substratum into roughly 96% of a dark substance and roughly 4% of pressureless matter is . to decide this question , one has to consider the pressureless matter fraction as a free parameter and to find out which abundance is actually favored by the data .",
    "our analysis revealed that the matter fraction probability is indeed highest for values smaller than roughly 8% .",
    "this is a result in favor of the unified viscous model .",
    "we recall that a corresponding analysis for a chaplygin gas results in values close to unity @xcite which seems to rule out such type of approaches .",
    "the present viscous model , on the other hand , remains an option for a unified description of the dark sector , at least as far as the matter power spectrum is concerned .",
