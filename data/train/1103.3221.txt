    "the second - order terms qualitatively show the same behavior as the first - order ones ,  @xcite but there is a notable difference between the electric and the magnetic part : the second - order contribution to the magnetic ldos at least is smaller than its first - order precessor , although only by a factor which is not small compared to unity , whereas the magnitude of the second - order electric contribution remains comparable to that of the first - order one , and even slightly exceeds it . at the bar s center ,",

    "in reality , the finite sensor size will lead to a lower resolution .",
    "second , we assume that the signal recorded by the device is proportional to the ldos at the dominant thermal frequency , which actually appears to be quite a good approximation for metallic samples .",

    "we emphasize that these figures serve to illustrate the basic principle and should not be taken at face value .",
    "the resolution achievable with an actual nsthm device will also depend on the type of surface structure under investigation ; a further limit will be imposed by the finite sensor volume . the key message",
    ", however , stands out clearly : when scanning an isothermal , nanostructured surface with a near - field scanning thermal microscope , one is able to resolve structures with linear extensions which may fall orders of magnitude below the scale set by the dominant thermal wave length .",
    "we have demonstrated that a numerical evaluation of greffet s perturbation series for the scattered electromagnetic field at rough surfaces  @xcite is routinely feasible up to second order .",
    "this allows one to evaluate the local density of states above surfaces with arbitrary profiles , thus lifting the restriction to the limited class of profiles which can be dealt with analytically .",
    "the convergence properties of this series seem to warrant further analysis . while one may reasonably guess that low - order perturbation theory should be sufficient when the profile height  @xmath23 is by far the smallest length scale of the problem , the slow decrease of the successive contributions to the electric ldos depicted in fig .",
