    "the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature @xmath1 and quark chemical potential @xmath2 is actively investigated in the context of the collider experiments using ultra - relativistic heavy ions , which create the highly - excited qcd matter.@xcite the chiral symmetry of qcd , which is spontaneously broken in the vacuum , will be restored at sufficiently high temperature and/or quark chemical potential .",
    "we investigate here the chiral phase transition of a qcd - like theory , focusing on the shape change of the effective potential near the critical point .",
    "the qcd - like theory is the renormalization - group ( rg ) improved ladder approximation for the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) equation of qcd.@xcite this theory describes the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking , retaining the correct high energy behavior of the quark propagator .",
    "using this theory and the low - density expansion , the pion - nucleon sigma term and the quark condensate at finite density have been calculated successfully.@xcite    as for the effective potential , the cornwall - jackiw - tomboulis ( cjt ) potential functional@xcite has been used in several works for the study of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . however , the interpretation of the cjt potential away from the extremum is not obvious .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the nature of the chiral phase transition through the shape change of the effective potential , we construct the landau potential@xcite of the qcd - like theory@xcite by using the auxiliary field method , in which the bilocal external field is introduced .",

    "in the qcd - like theory , first , we neglect the self - interaction between the gluons and integrate out the gluon fields , leaving the non - local interactions between the quark .",

    "we use the imaginary time formalism to extend the qcd - like theory to the case with finite temperature and chemical potential , making the following replacement : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the matsubara frequency for the fermion . the mass function @xmath52 at finite",
