    "they can be seen to be converging with increasing @xmath251 , the amplitude of the oscillations decreases , but do not quite converge for the cluster sizes accessible to us . as @xmath75 decreases from 3 , one can see that the convergence of the nlce initially worsens , the amplitude of the oscillations increases for any two contiguous values of @xmath251 , and then improves very close to @xmath115 .",
    "finally , it is apparent that the results for @xmath257 decrease with decreasing @xmath75 , as expected from the exact calculations discussed in the main text .",
    "we now turn our attention to the regime in which @xmath75 is very close to 1 .",

    "[ fig : nlcebarevsqa ] , where we report results for @xmath115 , 1.01 , 1.1 , and 1.2 . however , the results of our bare nlce sums still do not allow us to discriminate between the qa and gge results for @xmath115 , which are depicted as continuous and dashed horizontal lines , respectively .",
    "as discussed in nlce studies of systems in thermal equilibrium @xcite , whenever nlce series do not converge to a desired accuracy , one can use resummation techniques to accelerate the convergence of the series and obtain more accurate results .",

    "the last element after each cycle is expected to approach the @xmath258 result .",
    "the reduction in the number of elements after each cycle limits the number of times each algorithm can be applied to a series . in wynn",
    "s algorithm , each cycle reduces the number of elements by two , and in brezinski s algorithm each cycle reduces the number of elements by three . since our bare series for @xmath257 has 18 elements ( we consider clusters with up to 18 sites ) , the maximal number of cycles we can apply for wynn s algorithm is 8 and for brezinski s algorithm is 5 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlceresumvsqa ] we report the results ( the last element ) after each cycle of wynn s and brezinski s algorithms . as @xmath75 approaches 1",

    "this gives us confidence in the robustness of the resummations around the heisenberg point .",
    "figure  [ fig : nlceresumvsqa ] shows that , as @xmath131 and as the number of cycles increases , brezinski s algorithm appears to converge to a slightly larger value of @xmath257 than the qa prediction , while wynn s resummations seem to converge to a result slightly below the qa prediction .",
    "both are far from the gge prediction .",
    "hence , our nlce results support the correctness of the qa predictions for the outcome of the relaxation dynamics in these systems .    in the main text , we report the results of brezinski s resummations after one cycle as representative of the outcome of the resummation techniques used .",
    "this because those results are almost identical to the ones obtained using wynn s algorithm after one cycle , and are in between the results obtained after the maximal number of cycles that could be applied in each algorithm . in the main text",
    ", we also report an interval of confidence that contains all results obtained within brezinski s and wynn s resummations , except for @xmath259 for which the last cycle of brezinski s algorithm resulted in @xmath260 , which is out of the interval of confidence reported .",
    "we should add that the fluctuations in the values of @xmath75 after resummations increase as @xmath75 increases for @xmath261 .",
    "because of this , and the fact that the qa and gge results approach each other with increasing @xmath75 , we can not use our nlce results to discriminate between the qa and gge predictions as one moves further away from the heisenberg point ."
