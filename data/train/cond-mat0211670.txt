    "the magnetism of a large variety of so - called local moment systems , like manganites , gadolinium or europiumchalcogenides , is governed by an interplay of the properties of magnetic moments localized at certain atoms and itinerant conduction electrons propagating through the lattice . if the system of localized spins @xmath0 were treated independently , a certain magnetic order could be explained with the help of a heisenberg - like exchange coupling @xmath1 in contrast to that the kondo - lattice model tries to explain magnetic order via an indirect coupling of @xmath0 and @xmath2 mediated by the spin @xmath3 of the itinerant conduction electrons .",
    "the importance of the on - site interaction @xmath4 was first emphasized by zener @xcite .",
    "as far as the conduction electrons are concerned they might be described by their kinetic energy @xmath5 only . here , @xmath6 is a fermionic annihilation operator in second quantization . however , several authors @xcite pointed out that at least for manganites with its relatively narrow @xmath7-bands an _ ansatz _ that neglects any electron - electron interaction is an insufficient treatment .",
    "this is because @xmath8 is probably the largest energy scale in the problem .",
    "another indication of this insufficiency is the exact solution of the zero - bandwidth limit ( @xmath9 , also called _ atomic limit _ ) of the kondo - lattice model @xmath10 . in this limit",
    "the one - particle green s function has an excitation spectrum of four energy poles @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is defined by @xmath13 .",
    "if the `` test '' electron enters an empty lattice site the energies @xmath14 or @xmath15 are necessary .",
    "the other two energies occur if the entered lattice site is already occupied .",
    "apparently @xmath16 has the lowest energy for @xmath17 . because of the involved coulomb repulsion this is not understandable .    the simplest way to include electron - electron interaction in the hamiltonian is an on - site hubbard interaction @xmath18 it has been shown @xcite",
    "that this has an significant effect on the spectral function of the kondo - lattice model .",
    "for the _ atomic limit _",
    "calculation it implies that the energies @xmath16 and @xmath19 are shifted by @xmath8 and @xmath14 becomes lowest .",
    "the combination of all these possible effects in one hamiltonian @xmath20 is in this paper called * correlated kondo lattice model * ( cklm ) . due to the fact that there is no analytical solution of the cklm available , it is essential to obtain exact statements from limiting cases .    in a foregoing article",
    "@xcite we explained , why especially the generalization of the _ atomic limit _ result to a two - site cluster is important for a better understanding of the cklm .",
    "there , we investigated the hamiltonian @xmath10 with an assumed hopping integral of the form @xmath21 the part @xmath22 was omitted to gain the chance for a connection of the cluster to the lattice .",
    "this is possible if expectation values of spin operators , like @xmath23 are not uniquely determined by the properties of the cluster .",
    "furthermore , a hamiltonian without @xmath22 is much easier to handle .",
    "the part @xmath24 , on the other hand , was redundant since the limit of an empty conduction band was considered .",
    "for this situation , which is related to an insulator , we were able to give the complete analytical expression for the one - particle green s function as obtained by a solution of the equations of motion .    with the present paper we try to obtain similar results for metals .",
    "since the occupation of the conduction band is now arbitrary , the mathematical systems that need to be solved are about one order of magnitude larger than in the case of an insulator .",
    "additionally , it is necessary to take the hubbard interaction into account .",
    "therefore , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath25        \\label{eq : cluster - ham }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for simplicity we restrict ourself to @xmath28 .    despite of the larger effort , we use the same techniques already proposed for the insulator . what has been explained on the more concise problem there ,",
    "can now be applied directly .",
    "it will not be possible to provide every detail of the calculations here .",
    "a thorough documentation of all necessary transformations can be found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "to describe the properties of the electronic partial system of the cluster we are especially interested in the one - electron retarded green s function @xmath29 .",
    "this function is closely related to the spectral density and contains all information about possible single - particle excitations .",
    "the method of choice is an equation - of - motion technique .",
    "compared to a direct determination of the lehmann representation it has two advantages .",
    "first , an equation of motion @xmath30_+ \\big\\rangle }           + { \\big\\langle\\!\\big\\langle [ \\hat a , \\bar { \\cal h } ] _ - ; \\hat b                      \\big\\rangle\\!\\big\\rangle_e } .\\ ] ] contains as an inhomogeneity a correlation function @xmath31_+ \\big\\rangle } $ ] .",
    "this will directly appear in the numerator of the green s function , without being forced to actually calculate the expectation value .",
    "therefore , we are able to discuss the dependence of the spectral weights on parameters as the averaged band occupation or the averaged @xmath32-component of the localized spins . secondly , each equation of motion contains higher green s functions @xmath33_- ; \\hat b                      \\big\\rangle\\!\\big\\rangle_e } $ ] .",
    "hence , by using intelligent techniques we do not only get @xmath34 but a complete set of green s function with much more information .",
    "we will make use of this fact in the next section .",
    "since we are dealing with a finite size system , the hierarchy of equations of motion necessarily has to terminate .",
    "the complete set of 1040 equations can be formulated as a single matrix equation . by unitary transformations this matrix needs to be reduced to blocks of a size which can be solved directly .",
    "a first step in this direction is the implementation of the site symmetry .",
    "therefore , we define combined green s functions @xmath35 where the site index @xmath36 represents the opposite of site @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are arbitrary products of spin- and fermi - operators . the two partial systems for @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be solved separately and simultaneously ( they only differ in the sign of @xmath43 ) .",
    "even if additionally the mirror symmetry with respect to the spin quantization axis is used , one is still left with the large number of green s function listed below : @xmath44 + here , @xmath45 stands for all possible products of spin operators . if , as assumed , @xmath28 there are 10 such possibilities .",
    "the right column gives for each green s function the corresponding correlation function emerging in its equation of motion .",
    "it is useful to group these functions into four _ density classes _ , determined by the number of fermionic creation operators in its active part : @xmath46 the green s functions of density class @xmath47 vanish whenever the number of participating electrons is smaller than 3 .",
    "the ones in density class @xmath48 vanish if we have less than 2 electrons etc .. using this notation the matrix equation of all green s functions has the block structure @xmath49 \\hline \\\\[-4ex ]                                g_{{\\rm i\\!i}}\\\\[0.5ex ] \\hline \\\\[-4ex ]                                g_{{\\rm i\\!i\\!i}}\\\\[0.5ex ] \\hline \\\\[-4ex ]                                g_{{\\rm i\\!v}}\\end{array } \\right )    = \\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc }   k_{{\\rm i}}\\\\[0.5ex ] \\hline \\\\[-4ex ]                                k_{{\\rm i\\!i}}\\\\[0.5ex ] \\hline \\\\[-4ex ]                                k_{{\\rm i\\!i\\!i}}\\\\[0.5ex ] \\hline \\\\[-4ex ]                                k_{{\\rm i\\!v}}\\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] + where the right hand side represents the column of all inhomogeneities appearing in every equation of motion .",
    "since the matrix has a triangular shape , the remaining task is to find the inverse of the blocks @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "it is therefore possible to stay in certain density classes , which justifies the grouping .",
    "additionally , we can benefit from particle - hole symmetry .",
    "it implies that the density classes @xmath52 and @xmath47 as well as the classes @xmath53 and @xmath48 can be treated in a similar way , respectively .    the density class @xmath52 consists of the 10 green s functions with only one fermionic operator but with several spin operators .",
    "if one could assume that all green s functions of the other density classes vanish , one just had to invert the matrix @xmath54 to get a solution .",
    "the assumption is fulfilled if and only if one describes an insulator with a single excess electron in a otherwise empty conduction band .",
    "the foregoing article @xcite was devoted to these materials . in the case of arbitrary band occupations we have to solve the equation @xmath55 .",
    "since only the right hand side is modified we can use the same rules for the combination of spin operators in the green s functions as in the case of an insulator to simplify @xmath54 .",
    "matrix @xmath56 is also simplified by an intelligent combination of green s functions .",
    "as far as the spin operators are concerned we use again the rules proposed in the treatment of an insulator . to get an idea about the behavior of the fermionic operators we investigated another limiting case : if in @xmath57 the parameter @xmath58 is set to @xmath59 we have a system without any spin operator , namely a hubbard cluster .",
    "its solution is sketched in appendix [ the hubbard cluster ] .",
    "the rules for a formation of combined green s functions used there can then be applied to equation ( [ eq : matrix ] ) .",
    "this technique to combine green s functions by a successive treatment of the spin operators and the fermionic operators respectively works , but is rather lengthy and fault - prone . when doing this job we learned that a simple text editor can be awesomely helpful .",
    "already when generating the 1040 equations of motion a cut - and - paste mechanism can be used effectively , since the same commutators @xmath60_- ,       [ s^z_{s } , \\bar { \\cal h } ] _ - $ ] and @xmath61_- $ ] have to be implemented several times . for combinations",
    "the search - and - replace function is quite helpful .",
    "appendix [ combinations of green s functions ] gives detailed instructions which green s functions need to be summed and subtracted to achieve a simpler structure of @xmath56 .",
    "if implemented one obtains matrix blocks of size @xmath62 .",
    "there are four types of these matrices : @xmath63 here , we used the abbreviation @xmath64 and @xmath65 are sign parameters .",
    "@xmath66 , which already played a role in the insulator problem @xcite , has the eigenvalues @xmath67 the other matrices are connected to non - vanishing electron - densities as can be seen at the appearance of @xmath8 .",
    "the structure of @xmath68 is simple , and its eigenvalues are @xmath69 in contrast to that the determinantal polynomial of @xmath70 @xmath71 can only be factorized with cardan s formulas .",
    "the three eigenvalues of this cubic equation are @xmath72 \\\\",

    "this underlines the close relationship of the eigenvalue problem and the equation - of - motion technique .    to determine the inverse of @xmath78 it is sufficient to know its eigenvectors .",
    "as explained more detailed in the treatment of the insulator @xcite , basic algebra then immediately allows to give an expression for @xmath79 : @xmath80 = \\sum_{k=1}^3 \\frac{m_{xk}(i , j)}{{\\hat e}+ { \\hat e}_{xk}},\\ ] ] with well defined coefficients @xmath81 .",
    "this structure is particularly suitable because we intend to get the analytic expression for the one - particle green s function as @xmath82 with @xmath83 linear energy poles . since we succeeded to find combined green s functions which are connected in @xmath62 systems , an inversion of the matrices like in ( [ eq : inverse ] ) will ensure that every combined green s function has the form ( [ eq : standardform ] ) . to return to the original green s functions one just has to undo the combinations . that happens by summations and subtractions of the combined expressions and will therefore maintain the form ( [ eq : standardform ] ) .",
    "we mentioned above that the calculations can be done within certain density classes . to be more precise , to solve equation ( [ eq : matrix ] ) the following four matrix equations have to be considered",
    ": @xmath84 one has to obey this order , because apart from system @xmath47 we always have an input of a class with higher electron densities . on the one hand ,",
    "the matrix multiplication on the right side implies an additional summation of already calculated green s functions . on the other hand ,",
    "a partial fraction expansion is necessary to return to the form ( [ eq : standardform ] ) .",
    "@xmath85 occasionally , it happens that @xmath86 , leading to quadratic energy poles .",
    "however , after performing all necessary summations the spectral weight of these poles will always vanish .",
    "taking all this into account , one obtains after a straightforward calculation expressions for the green s functions of density class @xmath52 .",
    "if furthermore all combinations are undone , the desired analytical exact result for the one - electron green s function @xmath87 can be given .",
    "it consists of 102 energy poles .",
    "six of them , namely the energies @xmath88 are a result of the inversion of @xmath54 .",
    "they are just a subset of the energies @xmath89 which occur , if @xmath56 is inverted .",
    "the structure of these energy poles is quite clear .",
    "the green s functions of density class @xmath53 include excitation processes from a one - electron state to a two - electron state .",
    "the energies of the first are mediated by the eigenvalues of @xmath66 , the energies of the latter are connected to the matrices @xmath90 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath91 is just a trivial energy shift .",
    "@xmath92 actually belongs into the definition of @xmath66 .",
    "the super - index `` @xmath93 '' in @xmath94 illustrates that always both possible signs of @xmath43 need to be considered , as mentioned subsequently to ( [ eq : comb1 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath56 leads to @xmath95 energy poles .",
    "it has already been pointed out , that @xmath96 can be treated similarly to @xmath56 according to the particle - hole symmetry of the system .",
    "this symmetry can be investigated more thoroughly when the hamiltonian is reformulated in terms of hole - creation and -annihilation operators , @xmath97 .",
    "it leads to the result that with an energy pole @xmath98 of the one - particle green s function , @xmath99 is an energy pole , too .",
    "applied to ( [ eq : poles11])- ( [ eq : poles13 ] ) one gets all the energies related to the matrices @xmath96 and @xmath100 . since @xmath101 we have six degenerate energies , leading to @xmath102 energy poles of the one - particle green s function @xmath103 and all higher green s functions .",
    "all these excitation energies are functions of the model parameter @xmath104 and @xmath58 . since the cluster is a generalization of the _ atomic limit _ , the @xmath43-dependence is of special interest ( see figure [ fg : t - dep1 ] ) .    because of the large number of energy lines , the formation of two hubbard bands can clearly be seen .",
    "although they are well separated at small @xmath43 , there seems to be an overlap of the bands above @xmath105 .",
    "when going to higher values of @xmath43 a separation of the bands and a formation of bundles occurs . as can be seen when",
    "the two parts of figure [ fg : t - dep2 ] are compared    each of these bundles results from the @xmath58-splitting of an energy pole obtained for the two - site hubbard cluster ( appendix [ the hubbard cluster ] ) .",
    "this splitting can best be shown , if , as in figure [ fg : j - dep1 ] , the @xmath58-dependence of the energy poles is studied .",
    "the picture suggests a symmetry with respect to the sign of @xmath58 , but this is not completely given .",
    "coming back to figure [ fg : t - dep1 ] another striking fact needs to be mentioned .",
    "it concerns the limit @xmath106 , which is identically to the situation of the _ atomic limit_. as noted in ( [ eq : energies_al ] ) we expect in this limit a reduction to four energy poles .",
    "in contrast to that we obtain twice as many energy lines for @xmath107 in figure [ fg : t - dep1 ] . obviously , the energies alone are insufficient to describe excitation processes .",
    "remarks on the corresponding spectral weights are necessary .",
    "the routine we suggested for the solution of the equations of motion inevitably gives for each green s function these spectral weights , too .",
    "the fact that we do nt give the complete analytical solution here , has two main reasons .",
    "first of all , the routine consists of quite a lot of complicated summations : the combined green s function for instance are just sums .",
    "at least one summation is necessary to get the inverse of a single matrix as given by equation ( [ eq : inverse ] ) .",
    "their multiplication with a column of correlation functions as well as the matrix multiplications in each of the lines of ( [ eq : steps ] ) imply further sums . at the end partial fraction expansions have to be performed and the combinations of green s functions needs to be undone .",
    "even so , all this is simple arithmetics it leads to really lengthy expressions for the spectral weights .",
    "secondly , the spectral weights of each green s function depend in principle on all correlation functions that appear in inhomogeneities of the same or higher density classes . for @xmath108",
    "this means a dependence on 1040 correlation functions ( 1/3 is zero by definition ) .",
    "all of them need to be specified . only afterwards",
    "the result for the spectral weights is really meaningful .",
    "already when dealing with the limiting case of an empty conduction band @xcite one has to develop concepts for the determination of the emerging spin correlation functions . on the one hand , a simpler hamiltonian , that describes the spin system and includes lattice effects like anisotropy or molecular fields , can be investigated .",
    "alternatively , the spectral theorem provides information on these correlation functions .",
    "the latter concept implies that all calculations are based on the cluster hamiltonian only and no connection to the lattice is made . in this paper",
    "we are going to use a combination of these two concepts .    as mentioned before",
    ", it is a crucial advantage of our methods that besides @xmath103 a complete set of all green s functions participating in the equations of motion is obtained . for an arbitrary green s function , by construction given in the form ( [ eq : standardform ] ) ,",
    "the spectral theorem allows the calculation of a corresponding correlation function @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , we obtain expressions for 1040 correlation functions ( again 1/3 is zero by definition ) .",
    "their principle structure is equal for green s functions of the same density class .",
    "table [ tab : korrel ] allows a comparison with the structure of the corresponding inhomogeneities .",

    "the spectral theorem provides an equation that is linear in the correlation functions , because this linearity is given for the spectral weights @xmath113 in ( [ eq : spectraltheorem ] ) . in principle",

    "this seems to offer the possibility to use additionally the other concept for the correlation functions , that is to make assumptions for certain expectation values or to specify them on the basis of a hamiltonian that includes lattice effects . to achieve a non - vanishing magnetic order of the system of localized spins",
    "it is necessary to specify the spin correlation functions , @xmath116 .",
    "lattice effects can be included if these expectation values are based on the hamiltonian @xmath117 with @xmath118 as discussed in the forgoing article @xcite .",

    "however , the freedom for the specification of certain correlation functions is drastically reduced because of additional information available .",
    "we have already mentioned that 1/3 of the @xmath114 s is zero by definition , which reduces the number of unknown variables in ( [ eq : lgs1 ] ) .",
    "even so , in 1/3 of the cases the application of the spectral theorem ( [ eq : spectraltheorem ] ) does also give zero at the left hand side , this does not lead to a reduction of the number of equations since the right hand side is still a linear relation of the variables .",
    "furthermore , we know that certain pairs of correlation functions have to be identical due to symmetrical reasons .    hence , we actually do not have an under - determined problem , but rather more equations than variables .",
    "the indicator for a proper choice of equations is a nonzero result for the determinant of the matrix in ( [ eq : lgs2 ] ) .",
    "rules can again best been studied , if the limiting case @xmath122 , the hubbard cluster , is considered .    for an overdetermined problem",
    "the introduction of additional specifications for correlation functions is of course problematic .",
    "they are likely to contradict some other information we have about the system . for the sake of a connection between cluster and lattice we want to accept that .",
    "the consequences shall be demonstrated with an example : if the atomic limit ( @xmath107 ) is considered , 7 nontrivial correlation functions appear in the spectral weights of the one - particle green s function .",
    "since the spectral theorem provides only 6 equations , @xmath123 can be specified on the basis of a brillouin function for the lattice .",
    "however , if a non - vanishing value for @xmath123 is chosen one has to be aware of the fact that the equality @xmath124 will be broken .",
    "the equality itself follows from the assumption that expectation values are real , but can also be derived from particle - hole symmetry .",
    "if an equation like ( [ eq : lgs2 ] ) needs to be solved exactly for the correlation functions @xmath121 standard algebraic techniques like gauss elimination method can be used . in our work",
    "we implemented all these tedious manipulations in a computer program .",
    "its input values are the model parameters and assumed specifications for the correlation functions . by setting successively one and only one correlation function to @xmath125 , calculating the set of green s functions ( here",
    "the analytical exact expressions are used ) and applying the spectral theorem , the matrix ( [ eq : lgs1 ] ) is determined .",
    "afterwards the matrix equation ( [ eq : lgs2 ] ) is solved numerically exact .",
    "the last step contains a specific numerical problem . even if a proper set of equations is selected , for large ranges for the chemical potential @xmath126 the determinant of the matrix in ( [ eq : lgs2 ] ) might be rather small .",
    "this is connected to the fact that the fermi distribution function in ( [ eq : spectraltheorem ] ) is almost a step function for low temperatures .",
    "the effect can already be studied when looking at the _ atomic limit _ for the hubbard model @xmath127 after the application of ( [ eq : spectraltheorem ] ) the two equations ( @xmath128 ) @xmath129 define the correlation functions .",
    "whenever @xmath126 is located well between @xmath91 and @xmath130 and additionally @xmath131 , it is @xmath132 .",
    "then ( [ eq : numexcf ] ) becomes @xmath133 with a vanishing determinant of the matrix .",
    "analytically , one can strictly show that @xmath134^{-1 }   $ ] .",
    "the numerical problem can be avoided if the chemical potential is close to an energy pole or if the temperature is high enough .",
    "for the two - site hubbard cluster @xmath135 the mathematical systems are much smaller .",
    "hence , already temperatures around @xmath136 are sufficient to get meaningful results ( see figure [ fg : cp - dep ] ) over the whole range of the chemical potential ( c.p . )",
    ".    in regions for @xmath126 which are not close to the energy poles all spectral weights remain constant .",
    "figure [ fg : cp - dep ] also nicely illustrates a further consequence of the particle - hole symmetry . as already mentioned above , the energy poles of the one - particle green s function occur in pairs @xmath137 .",
    "we can now see that for the corresponding spectral weights the implication @xmath138 that can be proven analytically , is fulfilled .",
    "the signs of @xmath43 and @xmath139 are not essential because of site and mirror symmetry , respectively . instead , the @xmath126-dependence is the most important feature .",
    "coming back to the complete cklm we are again especially interested in the dependence of the cluster properties on @xmath43 . for @xmath107",
    "we are able to reproduce the _ atomic limit _",
    "results @xcite completely .",
    "this includes statements on the spectral weights and the fact that it vanishes for the four additionally emerged energy poles in figure [ fg : t - dep1 ] .",
    "the distribution of the spectral weight for higher values of @xmath43 is shown in figure [ fg : t - dep3 ] .",
    "especially for @xmath43 values higher than @xmath140 the dominance of the energy poles of the hubbard cluster can clearly be seen .",
    "the splitting of theses poles and a greater width of the bundles in figure [ fg : t - dep2 ] is connected to an increase of @xmath58 . nevertheless , a redistribution of spectral weight happens just gradually , as can be seen in figure [ fg : j - dep2 ] .",
    "it is remarkable that up to @xmath141 the spectral weight is restricted to a few energy poles .",
    "one can also see that some of the energy poles get small negative spectral weights .",
    "this is caused by the two problems mentioned above .",
    "on the one hand we have specified the values of the spin - correlation functions in figure [ fg : j - dep2 ] .",
    "the choice does certainly not match with calculations based on the two - site hamiltonian ( [ eq : cluster - ham ] ) .",
    "we have stressed above that this might lead to a breakdown of certain symmetries of the cluster .",
    "the fact that every spectral weight must be positive , as can be shown with the help of lehmann s representation , is a property that follows from such symmetries . on the other hand we also mentioned that an unfavourable choice for the chemical potential @xmath126 implies large numerical errors , due to very small determinants of matrices that need to be inverted",
    "this can also cause negative values for spectral weights .",
    "our program allows the presentation of the excitation spectrum for various situations .",
    "the main intension for the improvement of the _ atomic limit _",
    "calculations was the ability to treat also an antiferromagnet order of the system of localized spins .",
    "an example for typical results is given in figure [ fg : afm ] .",
    "as in most of the other figures one can see , that even though the green s function possesses more then 100 energy poles , only a few of them have a non - vanishing spectral weight .",
    "the expectation of quasi - continuous energy bands , provoked by pictures for the energy poles as figure [ fg : t - dep1 ] , is not met by the result obtained from the calculation of the spectral weights . like in the _ atomic limit _ we end up with a limited number of delta peaks in the spectrum .",
    "we considered the analytical solution for a two - site cluster described by the cklm .",
    "in contrast to a foregoing publication @xcite we did not restrict the occupation of the single conduction band .",
    "moreover , a correlation effect in the form of a hubbard interaction in this band is taken into account .",
    "the only remaining constraint is @xmath28 for the localized spins .",
    "the mathematical effort to achieve the analytical exact result for the green s function @xmath103 is immense .",
    "it was the goal of the paper to show that it is still manageable and to explain the necessary techniques .",
    "major points were the separation of the 1040 green s functions in four density classes , the use of intrinsical symmetries and the study of limiting cases as the empty conduction band and the hubbard cluster .",
    "as a consequence we found the `` correct '' combinations of green s functions ( appendix [ combinations of green s functions ] ) to obtain system sizes of order @xmath62 .",
    "the suggested routine for an analytical calculation consists of two main parts .",
    "first of all the set of equations of motion needs to be solved by : combining their inhomogeneities correctly , including the results for higher density classes as in equation ( [ eq : steps ] ) , inverting the @xmath62 matrices , performing partial fraction expansions and undoing the combinations of the green s functions .",
    "secondly , the correlation functions in the spectral weights need to be determined .",
    "this happens by : specifying a desired subset of the correlation functions , applying the spectral theorem to every determined green s function , selecting a representative set of these linear equations , using an lu - decomposition to solve the linear system of equations for the unspecified correlation functions .",
    "the first part has been done by hand and the analytical expressions for the obtained @xmath142 energy poles as well as a graphical presentation of the excitation spectrum has been given in this paper .",
    "the correlation effect , which leads to a formation of two hubbard bands , and the characteristic dependence on the important model parameters can clearly be seen in figure [ fg : t - dep1 ] , [ fg : t - dep2 ] and [ fg : j - dep1 ] . for the second part",
    "a computer program has been used , since there exist reliable routines for the numerically exact decomposition of large systems .",
    "the resulting vector for the correlation functions was used to discuss the distribution of the spectral weight among the excitation energies . a major conclusion from the provided figures",
    "is the concentration of the spectral on a few energy poles .",
    "the notion of almost `` continuous '' bands formed by @xmath142 energies is not confirmed if the numerators of the green s functions are considered .",
    "we propose to use a subset of the correlation functions in the numerators of the green s functions to construct a connection of the cluster to the lattice .",
    "this freedom in the specification of expectation values strongly influences the results for the spectral weights .",
    "we have pointed out , that as a possible side effect of this procedure symmetries of the cluster might be destroyed , leading to certain unphysical features .",
    "we intend to use the results of this work as a limiting case to test various approximations for the complete cklm .",
    "furthermore , the cluster result itself can serve as a starting point for an approximation of the lattice",
    ". we are convinced that techniques similar to what has been proposed here can be used to treat slightly more complex systems , like a cluster with a higher value for the localized spin @xmath12 or another number of lattice sites .",
    "one of us ( t.  h. ) gratefully acknowledges the financial support of the _ studienstiftung des deutschen volkes_. this work also benefitted from the financial support of the _ sonderforschungsbereich sfb 290 _ of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft .",
    "an analytical solution of a two - site hubbard cluster has already been given by several authors @xcite .",
    "we present here a direct solution , that is compatible to the language of equations of motion used in the rest of the paper .",
    "we study the hamiltonian @xmath143 using abbreviation ( [ eq : comb1 ] ) we need to consider a set of green s functions which is almost identical to the list given in section [ solution for the equations of motion ] .",
    "however , in contrast to the cklm cluster we have @xmath144 what decreases the number of functions drastically . we are left with the following set of equations of motion , written again in a matrix representation : @xmath145    it is now essential to introduce the combinations @xmath146          x_{\\rm k}^{({\\epsilon } ) } & = & x_{\\rm k}^{({\\epsilon } ) } + x_{\\rm h}^{({\\epsilon } ) } , &          x_{\\rm h}^{({\\epsilon } ) } & = & x_{\\rm k}^{({\\epsilon } ) } - x_{\\rm h}^{({\\epsilon } ) } , \\\\          x_{\\rm l}^{({\\epsilon } ) } & = & x_{\\rm l}^{({\\epsilon } ) } + x_{\\rm j}^{({\\epsilon } ) } , &          x_{\\rm j}^{({\\epsilon } ) } & = & x_{\\rm l}^{({\\epsilon } ) } - x_{\\rm j}^{({\\epsilon } ) } ,       \\end{array}\\ ] ] where `` @xmath147 '' stands for `` @xmath148 '' or `` @xmath149 '' .",
    "as one can see the matrix representation of the original equations of motion contains blocks of the size @xmath150 .",
    "after the proposed combination the remaining maximum block size is @xmath151 , which can easily be inverted : @xmath152 the form of the energy constant @xmath153 demonstrates , that quadratic system sizes are inevitable . we get the following matrix for the equations of motion : @xmath154    what remains",
    "is a straightforward solution of ( [ eq : hub_matrix2 ] ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath155 can immediately be written down . to get @xmath156 and @xmath157 in a form with linear energy poles ,",
    "a single partial fraction expansion is necessary . for @xmath158 and @xmath159 one",
    "has to apply ( [ eq : hub_22inverse ] ) .",
    "and with a few more steps one gets + @xmath160 we have defined the sum of correlation functions @xmath161 as a last step on the way to the desired single - particle green s function one has to undo the combination ( [ eq : comb1 ] ) by considering the sum @xmath162 . then we obtain the result + @xmath163",
    "first of all the notation for the green s functions needs to be clarified .",
    "each of them gets to subindex that consists of a number and a letter .",
    "the latter part has already been introduced above when the list of green s functions with different possibilities for the fermionic operators is given .",
    "the former part enumerates the possibilities for spin operators @xmath45 .",
    "the numbers @xmath164 are used for @xmath165 .",
    "additionally , the green s functions @xmath166 and @xmath167 with @xmath168 for @xmath169 appear in the necessary equations of motion .",
    "each green s function taken @xmath170 times for the different possibilities for @xmath171 and @xmath172 gives the number @xmath173 .                                                    c. zener , phys .",
