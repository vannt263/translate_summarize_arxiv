    ", applications involving both dms and manganites very much depend on our understanding of their transport properties at various doping levels and temperatures ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in addition , dms also has several interesting physical properties namely , anomalous hall - effect  @xcite , large magnetoresistance in low dimensional geometries  @xcite , the changes of electron - phase - coherence time in the presence of magnetic impurities  @xcite and negative bend resistance  @xcite . as for the transport properties ,",
    "there are several models developed to characterize the resistivity of dms .",
    "in particular , the impurity band model coupled with the multiple exchange interactions for @xmath4 for ga@xmath5mn@xmath6as was proposed  @xcite .",
    "the electronic states of the impurity band can be either localized or delocalized , depending on doping concentration or the fermi - level ( @xmath7 ) . if @xmath7 is in the localized - state , then the conduction is due to carrier hopping .",

    "the spin disorder scattering resistivity as a function of magnetic susceptibility can be used to estimate the magnitude of @xmath9 ( the ferromagnetic ( fm ) exchange interaction energy )  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are also theories that qualitatively explain the conductivity for @xmath10 , namely , the kohn - luttinger kinetic exchange model  @xcite and the semiclassical boltzmann model  @xcite .    apart from that , for manganites , the one- and two - orbital models  @xcite and the phase separated resistivity model  @xcite have been used to qualitatively describe the resistivity curves for @xmath10 . however , in all these approaches , we are faced with two crucial problems , the need ( i ) to explain how the resistivity evolve with different doping elements , without any _ a priori _ assumption on carrier density and ( ii ) to understand how defects and clustering affect the evolution of @xmath0 curves . here",
    ", we show unequivocally , a new method to analyse the evolution of @xmath0 curves for different doping elements using the concept of the @xmath1 invoked in the hamiltonian and fermi - dirac statistics . in doing so",
    ", we can also understand the evolution of @xmath0 curves in the presence of defects and clustering , which is important for characterization of spintronics devices .",
    "the @xmath1 concept has broad applications , where it has been applied successfully for the normal state ( above critical temperature ) of high temperature superconductors  @xcite and ferroelectrics  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 model is for compounds obtained via substitutional doping , not necessarily homogeneous or defect - free .",
    "a typical solid contains 10@xmath11 strongly interacting particles . therefore , their universal collective behavior is of paramount interest as compared to the microscopic details of each particular particle and the potential that surrounds it .",

( [ eq:100 ] ) ) .",

    ". we can prove by means of constructive ( existence ) and/or direct proofs , by choosing a particular form of wavefunction with known solution ( harmonic oscillator , dirac - delta and coulomb potentials ) and then calculate the total energy by comparison .",
    "in doing so , we will find that the total energy is always given by @xmath21 , as it should be ( see appendix and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for an isolated atom",
    ", the concept of ionization energy implies that ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq:100 ] ) )    @xmath22    where @xmath1 is the ionization energy of an isolated atom .",
    "the corresponding total energy is @xmath23 .",

    "( [ eq:360 ] ) , one can surmise that large @xmath1 corresponds to the difficulty of the electron to conduct due to a large coulomb attraction between the electron and the ionic core",
    ". this effect will give rise to low conductivity .",
    "the variation of @xmath1 with doping in our model somewhat resembles the variation produced from the impurity band model with doping  @xcite .",
    "the difference is that our model fixes the fermi level as a constant and we let @xmath1 capture all the changes due to doping , consistent with ionization energy based fermi - dirac statistics ( @xmath38fds ) . whereas",

    "the carrier density can be calculated from    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the density of states and @xmath7 is defined from now on as the fermi level at @xmath3 = 0 so as to comply with eq .",
    "( [ eq:100 ] ) .      here , we will show the relationship of the ionization energy to the energy level splitting and the spin - orbit coupling , as well as their association with resistivity .",
    "the latter association is crucial because spin - orbit coupling is found to be an an important phenomenon that influences the electronic properties of the magnetic semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that the energy associated with both the relativistic correction and the spin - orbit coupling for hydrogen - like atoms is given by the fine structure formula , @xmath41 ( ref .",

    "( [ eq:100 ] ) and  ( [ eq:999 ] ) , we can show the extreme magnitude of the energy level splitting ( i.e. , between @xmath44 = 1 and @xmath44 = @xmath49 ) is    @xmath50    thus , the magnitude of the energy level splitting ( @xmath51 ) is proportional to the ionization energy ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath52 , while it is inversely proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "that is , @xmath51 also decreases with decreasing ionization energy ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can surmise that a system with large ionization energy gives rise to large spin - orbit coupling , which is important for spin - injection  @xcite in @xmath53-type dms . as discussed earlier however",
    ", a large ionization energy also leads to a small carrier density ( from eq .",
