    "since their introduction in the seminal papers of @xcite and @xcite , there has been a remarkable amount of interest in heteroscedastic models coming from researchers in econometrics and statistics and from financial market practitioners . since then , many other similar models have been introduced to more accurately reflect different qualities of real data .",
    "for example , various authors have proposed a vast number of volatility expressions with asymmetries or thresholds , non - stationarities such as unit roots or time - varying parameters , or have considered multidimensional extensions and non - regular time intervals .",
    "we refer to two of more recent reviews @xcite and @xcite which discuss these and other examples and provide the necessary references .",
    "heteroscedastic models are used to analyze and forecast the unobserved volatility of different financial time series .",
    "it is common to construct predictions for current and future volatility values using a natural recursive volatility approximation .",
    "let us recall its definition for a general conditional heteroscedastic model .",
    "we define such model as a solution of @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the return process , @xmath4 is the volatility process , @xmath5 is a known function , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the parameter vector taken from a set @xmath8 and @xmath9 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables on a probability space @xmath10 .",
    "more general versions of ( [ equ_garch_general ] ) are of course possible .",
    "assume that @xmath11 are observed , fix @xmath12 and define the recursive volatility approximation by @xmath13 for any @xmath14 .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 is often used as an estimate of the volatility value at @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is any consistent estimator of @xmath7 .",
    "there are other possible definitions of @xmath18 .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest using the sample mean of @xmath19 as a starting point instead of @xmath20 .    in order for approximations ( [ equ_vol_forecast ] ) to be consistent ,",
    "it is natural to at least expect that the approximation @xmath21 ( using the _ true _ parameter vector ) converges to the unobserved value @xmath22 : @xmath23 ) , we ll re - use the following definition from @xcite :    [ def_invertibility ] assume for all @xmath24 the model ( [ equ_garch_general ] ) has a strictly stationary solution and ( [ equ_vol_converges ] ) is true for any initial point @xmath20 .",
    "then we say the model has the property of _",
    "note that many estimator types and tests are very commonly considered under the assumption of invertibility .",
    "indeed , such estimators as the popular quasi - maximum likelihood estimator ( qmle ) of @xcite and more recent gmm - type robust estimators of @xcite or minimum distance estimators as in @xcite as well as many others are based on residuals @xmath25 .",
    "their asymptotic properties are commonly established assuming convergence of residuals , therefore under invertibility .",
    "the same assumption is used for popular tests types such as goodness - of - fit and dimensionality tests ( see @xcite ) and structural break tests ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the issue of non - invertibility is key for such procedures .",
    "the notable exception are estimators based on autocovariance function such as whittle estimator applied in @xcite and @xcite .    for linear time",
    "series models such as arma the notion of invertibility is classic , see e.g. @xcite . for non - linear models ,",
    "however , there seem to be more than one possible definition .",
    "the definition [ def_invertibility ] is based on that of @xcite .",
    "for detailed discussion and some further references , see @xcite , subsection 3.2 . a related definition of invertibility , in particular for bilinear models ,",
    "was considered previously in @xcite . according to tong s definition ,",
    "the model ( [ equ_garch_general ] ) is called invertible if @xmath26 is a.s . a measurable function of @xmath27 for any @xmath28 .",
    "we ll refer to this notion as global invertibility ( this is in contrast to local invertibility , see the next paragraph ) .",
    "recently , there have been some further results on invertibility of non - linear models .",
    "the threshold ma models were investigated in @xcite and @xcite , and non - linear arma ( nlarma ) models were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that some heteroscedastic models ( for example , egarch of @xcite and vgarch of @xcite ) may in general be non - invertible , even if the model has a strictly stationary solution .",
    "moreover , we will provide necessary and sufficient conditions for invertibility for such models .",
    "we will demonstrate that if a model is locally invertible ( see definition [ def_proper_unidentifiability ] below , also @xcite for the similar definition ) , it is also invertible . on the other hand , we ll prove that under a slightly more restricting condition than a lack of local invertibility the model is also non - invertible .",
    "moreover , we will show that on an extended probability space there exists a random variable @xmath29 , independent with @xmath30 , such that for @xmath31 the process @xmath32 is stationary but @xmath33 to the best of our knowledge , this is the first use of the notion of local invertibility in the literature on heteroscedastic models .",
    "its usefulnes is that it s much easier to check that invertibility itself , this will be discussed below .",
    "the used method is general and may be applied to many other heteroscedastic models .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in the subsection [ sec_stat_inv ] we provide necessary definitions and discuss non - invertibility in more detail .",
    "the main results of the paper are given in the section [ sec_main_results ] .",
    "as a fact of independent interest and an illustration of non - invertibility , we provide the results of numerical simulations showing that it is possible to have deterministic chaos ( in the sense of @xcite ) in egarch in subsection [ sec_egarch_chaos ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec_proofs ] contains proofs .",
    "let us recall the definition of the garch(@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) model of @xcite .",
    "it is defined as a solution of particular case of ( [ equ_garch_general ] ) with @xmath34 and @xmath35 where @xmath36 we ll be interested in the strictly stationary solution of ( [ equ_garch ] ) .",
    "the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and uniqueness of such a solution was found in @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "let s consider a case @xmath37 .",
    "then the condition reads    [ cond_stat_garch ] @xmath38    here and in the rest of the paper we denote the natural logarithm @xmath39 .",
    "it is easy to see that in garch(@xmath40 , @xmath40 ) model strict stationarity implies invertibility . indeed ,",
    "condition [ cond_stat_garch ] implies that @xmath41 .",
    "then @xmath42 therefore @xmath43 implying invertibility . using the multidimensional version of condition [ cond_stat_garch ]",
    ", one can check that the same implication is also true for the general garch(@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "however , the stationarity does not imply invertibility for other heteroscedastic models .",
    "notably , it turns out this relation fails for the egarch model of @xcite and the vgarch model of @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we ll consider only 1-dimensional models of those types .",
    "the general model ( [ equ_garch_general ] ) for the 1-dimensional case may be written as @xmath44    [ def_egarch ] egarch is defined as a solution of @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the parameter vector and @xmath9 are i.i.d .",
    "[ def_vgarch ] vgarch is defined as a solution of @xmath47 where @xmath46 is the parameter vector and @xmath9 are i.i.d .    in order to make the models meaningful",
    ", we need to enforce certain restriction on parameter values . for egarch , we assume that @xmath48 ( see @xcite , p. 20",
    "for discussion of why this is reasonable , note somewhat different notation ) and that @xmath49 .",
    "for vgarch , we demand that @xmath50 .",
    "it follows from the theorem 2.5 from @xcite that a necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a strictly stationary solution to ( [ equ_egarch ] ) and ( [ equ_vgarch ] ) are given by    [ cond_stat_egarch ] @xmath51    [ cond_stat_vgarch ] @xmath52    respectively .",
    "we will assume these conditions to hold throughout the rest of the paper , and denote the stationary solution of either ( [ equ_egarch ] ) or ( [ equ_vgarch ] ) by @xmath53 .",
    "the issue of invertibility is , however , more complicated .",
    "first , let s consider the explicit expressions for @xmath54 .",
    "since the sequence of random variables @xmath9 is unobservable , it needs to be approximated .",
    "commonly this is done using the residuals @xmath55 for egarch , we define @xmath56 recursively as a solution of @xmath57 for vgarch @xmath56 are given by @xmath58 in both cases , we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a sequence of random transformations @xmath61 , defined for the general model ( [ equ_garch_general_1dim ] ) by @xmath62 crucially , the random transformations defining @xmath63 ( cf .",

    "( [ equ_egarch_sigmahat ] ) , ( [ equ_vgarch_sigmahat ] ) ) are different . indeed ,",
    "for the general model ( [ equ_garch_general_1dim ] ) we have @xmath65 note that the right - hand side of the second equation in ( [ equ_sigma_sigmahat_system ] ) depends not only on @xmath66 , but also on @xmath67 .    for a general heteroscedastic model invertibility holds if the top lyapunov exponent of the corresponding sequence @xmath60 is negative ( proposition 3.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall the definition of lyapunov exponent of a family of transformations :    [ def_lyapunov_exp ] assume @xmath68 is a stationary ergodic family of @xmath69 functions , such that @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the lipchitz norm , @xmath72 then the quantity @xmath73 is called the top lyapunov exponent .",
    "however , estimating top lyapunov exponent for nonlinear systems is not straightforward ( and therefore checking whether the sufficient condition for invertibility holds is hard , p. 21 of @xcite ) .",
    "note that the second equation of ( [ equ_sigma_sigmahat_system ] ) could be nonlinear in @xmath66 even if the first one is linear !",
    "therefore , the results of @xcite are not applicable . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for invertibility of such nonlinear models are not known .",
    "we will consider a simple lower bound for the lyapunov exponent which will be useful for the construction of a criteria for invertibility .",
    "from now on , we will write @xmath18 instead of @xmath74 for brevity .    [ def_stability_coeff ] assume that the equation ( [ equ_garch_general_1dim ] ) has a unique stationary solution @xmath75 .",
    "assume also that for any fixed @xmath24 the function @xmath76 is continuously differentiable .",
    "denote @xmath77 @xmath78 we will refer to @xmath79 as _ stability coefficient _ and call a heteroscedastic model locally invertible if @xmath80 and locally non - invertible otherwise .",
    "a similar definition for non - linear arma models was considered in @xcite .",

    "<S> if this approximation ( based on true parameter vector ) converges to the real volatility . </S>",
    "<S> our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for invertibility . </S>",
    "<S> we will show that the stationary garch(@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) model is always invertible , but certain types of models , such as egarch of @xcite and vgarch of @xcite may indeed be non - invertible . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we will demonstrate it s possible for the pair ( true volatility , approximation ) to have a non - degenerate stationary distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in such cases , the volatility estimate given by the recursive approximation with the true parameter vector is inconsistent .    _ key words : _ conditionally heteroscedastic time series , egarch , vgarch , invertibility , lyapunov exponent .    _ journal of economic literature clasification : _ c14 , c58 . </S>"
