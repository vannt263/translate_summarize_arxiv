    "when einstein gave birth to general relativity with the presentation of his field equations in 1915 , new phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves were soon predicted as consequences of this theory . in the last couple of years , gravitational waves have attracted ever more attention . with the aim to finally receive signals of such waves , much experimental effort has been put upon mounting land - based detectors .",
    "_ virgo _ in france and italy , _",
    "geo 600 _ in germany and the uk , and _ ligo _ in the usa are only to name a few .",
    "they are soon to be joined by the space - based _",
    "elisa_. in order to track any signal of gravitational waves , templates are required that give a hint on which needle to look for in the haystack of data delivered by all the working detectors .",
    "such templates , in turn , can only be obtained by singling out the most promising sources of gravitational waves and calculating their motion in phase space .",
    "the main source of waves have been identified to be binary systems consisting of inspiraling compact objects , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "their mass proportions can be anything between equal masses and extreme ratios .",
    "binaries with very unequal masses are called extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) . one common example of an emri is a neutron star that orbits a super massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "emris allow for a simple description as a free particle ( the lighter one ) moving in a curved spacetime given by the metric corresponding to the mass of the heavier particle .",
    "many possible shapes of the background metric have been proposed in this field , e.g. , @xcite .    binaries with not so extreme a mass ratio are suitably described by the post - newtonian formalism .",
    "this approach was possible after arnowitt , deser and misner discovered that einstein s theory can be formulated as a hamiltonian system , @xcite .",
    "the idea is then to expand the elements of the metric tensor and the equations of motion of the matter in powers of the small parameter @xmath0 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "this gives the hamiltonian as a power series in the small parameter , the first term of the series being the hamiltonian for newton s law of gravitation .",
    "the determination of the individual terms in this expansion is subject to current research in theoretical physics and contributions up to @xmath1pn order have been given in @xcite .",
    "the post - newtonian approach has even been extended to a binary which is perturbed by a much lighter third body , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a property of relativistic test - particles which is not known from classical mechanics is their spin . after the foundation for the treatment of this spin",
    "had been laid down in the 1950s , e.g. , @xcite , the post - newtonian formalism could be expanded to include the corresponding contributions .",
    "these comprise spin - orbit as well as spin - spin interactions , see , e.g. , @xcite . with this extension ,",
    "the hamiltonian system becomes a so called poisson system .",
    "one important property of the post - newtonian is that they are generally non - integrable . as a consequence",
    ", the motion described by them can exhibit chaotic traits .",
    "if the motion of a particular binary is chaotic , the gravitational waves emitted during its inspiral will be unpredictable , thus leaving the researchers at the various wave detectors without any useful template .",
    "hence , the investigation for chaos of a given binary system is an important task .",
    "consequently , many works have been published concerning this topic both in the geodesic and the post - newtonian field , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the analysis of chaos requires reliable indicators and , above all , numerical simulations over very long time spans .",
    "numerical long - term analysis , in turn , relies on there being efficient and highly accurate integration schemes which behave well even during long - time simulations . to this aim",
    "one can make use of the post - newtonian equations special structure .    over the last few decades , the numerical analysis community came up with tools for the long - term integration of equations of motion .",
    "in the course of this , structure preserving algorithms such as symplectic schemes for hamiltonian systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) or symmetric integrators for time - reversible systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) have been proposed .",
    "regarding long - time behaviour and conservation properties , these schemes are superior to ordinary numerical integrators such as explicit runge - kutta schemes in many applications of classical mechanics and astronomy .",
    "whereas for standard integration schemes the overall error is normally proportional to the square of the length of the integration interval @xmath2 , it only increases linearly with @xmath2 for structure preserving integrators . and whereas there is a drift in constants of motions for standard methods , these constants are conserved up to a small error over extremely long times for symplectic algorithms .",
    "these algorithms have been successfully applied even in quantum mechanics .",
    "a comprehensive presentation of such methods is given by @xcite .",
    "in the last years , attempts have been made to construct structure preserving integrators for relativistic systems of compact binaries .",
    "most recently , such a scheme has been proposed for the geodesic approximation , see @xcite . in the realm of post - newtonian equations ,",
    "two different approaches have been considered so far .",
    "first , a non - canonically symplectic integrator has been constructed which preserves the system s poisson structure , see @xcite .",
    "then , a transformation to canonical form has been proposed , see @xcite , after which symplectic methods have been applied , @xcite .",
    "all the previous approaches have in common that they are based on a splitting of the hamiltonian into a newtonian part and other relativistic contributions . in this work",
    ", we will first argue and then demonstrate via numerous experiments that a more efficient and accurate method for the solution of post - newtonian equations consists of a transformation to symplectic form followed by the application of gauss runge - kutta schemes .",
    "this will drastically reduce the numerical effort when simulating post - newtonian systems .",
    "our work is organized as follows : we first explain our notation in section  [ sec - not ] .",
    "afterwards we will discuss the post - newtonian equations of motion and their numerical properties in section  [ sec - ii ] .",
    "in section  [ sec - iii ] we briefly summarize the main aspects of the poisson integrator of @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec - iv ] deals with the transformation to canonical form .",
    "the subsequent section  [ sec - v ] presents common splitting methods .",
    "then , in section  [ sec - vi ] we present gauss runge - kutta schemes and argue why they are a good choice in post - newtonian simulations .",
    "finally , we subject the individual methods to extensive tests and compare them to standard explicit schemes in section  [ sec - vii ] before we summarize our main results in section  [ sec - viii ] .",
    "in this work we use canonically conjugate position and momentum variables and restrict ourselves to the center - of - mass frame so that we have the relevant variables ( with @xmath3 denoting the individual compact objects ) @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for the sake of shorter notation",
    "we will combine the relevant variables of the phase space into one variable @xmath8 . with this abbreviation",
    "we can write the equations of motion as @xmath9 with an appropriate function @xmath10 .",
    "an exact solution of a differential equation of the form   which starts at a given point @xmath11 and propagates the system over a time @xmath12 will be denoted by @xmath13 whereas a numerical approximated flow over a time step @xmath14 is written as @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , for a given point of the phase space @xmath16 , the next point on the numerical trajectory is calculated as @xmath17 finally , @xmath18 is a unit matrix of appropriate dimension and @xmath19 is the symplecticity matrix @xmath20",
    "we consider orbital contributions up to order @xmath1pn as given in @xcite and the leading term of the spin - orbit ( so ) and the spin - spin ( ss ) contribution of @xcite , respectively .",
    "with all these terms , our hamiltonian reads @xmath21 as the motion does not depend on the absolute value of the masses but on their ratio , one can without loss of generality assume the total mass @xmath22 to be equal to @xmath23 . using the reduced mass @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and the unit vector @xmath27 and choosing units such that @xmath28 , the relevant terms of the orbital hamiltonian @xmath29 are @xmath30+\\frac\\mu{2q^2},\\\\      h_{2\\text{pn , orb}}(\\mathbf p,\\mathbf x)&=\\frac1{16\\mu^5}(1 - 5\\nu5\\nu^2)(\\mathbf p^2)^3\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac1{8\\mu^3q}\\left[(5 - 20\\nu-3\\nu^2)(\\mathbf p^2)^2-\\nonumber\\right.\\\\   & \\left.2-\\nu^2(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^2\\mathbf p^2 + 3\\nu^2(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^4\\right]\\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac1{2\\mu q^2}[3\\nu(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^2+(5 + 8\\nu)\\mathbf p^2]\\nonumber\\\\   & -\\frac{(1 + 3\\nu)\\mu}{4q^3},\\\\   h_{3\\text{pn , orb}}(\\mathbf p,\\mathbf x)&=\\frac1{128\\mu^7}(-5 + 35\\nu-70\\nu^2 + 35\\nu^3)(\\mathbf p^2)^4\\nonumber\\\\   & + \\frac1{16\\mu^5q}\\left[(-7 + 42\\nu-53\\nu^2 - 5\\nu^3)(\\mathbf p^2)^3\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   & + ( 2 - 3\\nu)\\nu^2(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^2(\\mathbf p^2)^2\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left.+3(1-\\nu)\\nu^2(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^4\\mathbf p^2 - 5\\nu^3(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^6\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac1{16\\mu^3q^2}\\left[\\vphantom{\\frac12}(-27 + 136\\nu+109\\nu^2)(\\mathbf p^2)^2\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + ( 17 + 30\\nu)\\nu(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^2\\mathbf p^2\\nonumber\\\\ & \\left.+\\frac34(5 + 43\\nu)\\nu(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^4\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac1{\\mu q^3}\\left\\{\\left[-\\frac{25}8+\\left(\\frac{\\pi^2}{64}-\\frac{335}{48}\\right)\\nu-\\frac{23}8\\nu^2\\right]\\mathbf p^2\\right.\\nonumber\\\\   & \\left.+\\left(-\\frac{85}{16}-\\frac{3\\pi^2}{64}-\\frac{7\\nu}4\\right)\\nu(\\mathbf n\\cdot\\mathbf p)^2\\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac\\mu{q^4}\\left[\\frac18+\\left(\\frac{109}{12}-\\frac{21\\pi^2}{32}\\right)\\nu\\right ] .",

    ".    furthermore , the post - newtonian equations are in fact a perturbed kepler problem , the corrections to the classical motion scaling with @xmath0 . in the units @xmath28",
    "this scaling is encoded in the higher orders of @xmath38 or @xmath39 in the post - newtonian terms . as @xmath40 and @xmath41 in most circumstances",
    ", one has a hamiltonian of the form @xmath42 where the  larger  part can be solved analytically . keeping in mind the just mentioned properties of the post - newtonian equations we now present the already known integration methods .",
    "the poisson integrator suggested by @xcite is designed to exactly preserve the structure . starting with the hamiltonian ,",
    "the relativistic contribution @xmath43 is first split into an orbital part @xmath44 and a spin term @xmath45 .",
    "the main idea is now to further decompose the spin - orbit and spin - spin parts as @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 the major achievement of @xcite was to find analytical solutions @xmath50 , @xmath51 for the flow of each spin related part .",
    "this said , a structure preserving integrator @xmath52 for the spinning terms is obtained by setting @xmath53 thus , if one solves the flow @xmath54 of the newtonian part analytically and uses a symplectic scheme to calculate the orbital relativistic contributions @xmath55 , one can finally combine the three flows @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath52 to obtain a structure preserving flow . in section  [ sec - v ]",
    "we will discuss how to best arrange the individual flows .",
    "instead of directly preserving the poisson structure   we can choose another way : the _ darboux - lie theorem _ states that for every poisson system @xmath56 one can find a transformation @xmath57 such that the system in the coordinates @xmath58 is locally canonical .",
    "there are two properties of the post - newtonian equations which enable us to find such a transformation in this case .",
    "firstly , the positions and momenta are already in canonical form .",
    "therefore , a transformation @xmath59 only has to focus on the spin coordinates .",
    "secondly , by multiplying the equations of motions of the spins @xmath60 with the respective spin @xmath61 , we see that @xmath62 i.e. , the length of the individual spins is a first integral .",
    "these two observations make it surprisingly easy to achieve the transformation to symplectic form .    from the constancy of the spin - length",
    "we see that two spin variables are redundant .",
    "the post - newtonian system can therefore be described by @xmath63 variables . because of this , @xcite proposed the use of cylindrical coordinates for the spins .",
    "accordingly , we set @xmath64 where @xmath65 relates the length of an object s spin to the square of its mass .",
    "the conservation of the spin - length allows for the elimination of one of the variables @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we can express @xmath67 in terms of @xmath68 as @xmath69 whereby the spin and thus the hamiltonian only depend on @xmath70 and @xmath68 .    in order to deduce the equations of motion for the two independent variables , we observe that the following equalities hold true : @xmath71 for the sake of shorter notation",
    ", we assume w.l.o.g . that @xmath72 until the end of this section .",
    "due to relation @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 where the second equality is simply the equation of motion for the @xmath75-component of the spin . substituting @xmath76 and @xmath77 with the help of equations @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and then applying @xmath80 we get @xmath81 we now consider the time - derivatives of the @xmath82- and @xmath83- components . taking into account the equations of motion for these components , the derivatives with regard to time are @xmath84",
    "we can multiply the first equation with @xmath85 and the second with @xmath86 and substract the two equations .",
    "this leads to @xmath87 calculating the partial derivatives of the spin components with regard to the new variables on the left hand side and some of the partial derivatives on the right hand side , equation  @xmath88 becomes @xmath89 keeping in mind that @xmath90 and then taking use of relation @xmath91 , we arrive at @xmath92 all in all , the post - newtonian equations for the ten independent variables @xmath93 read @xmath94 which is to say that the system in the new variables is symplectic .",
    "what is more , the transformation is defined globally as it is nothing other than expressing the spins with constant length via cylindrical coordinates . as a consequence",
    ", a structure preserving algorithm for the post - newtonian equations can be obtained by carrying out the global transformation to canonical form and then applying a symplectic integrator .",
    "it is well known , e.g. , @xcite , that , given a hamiltonian of the form  , an integrator which is split in this natural way has a smaller local error than a comparable scheme .",
    "more precisely , suppose we were given some second order method .",
    "we could apply it with a given step size @xmath14 to the whole system  , thus constructing the flow @xmath95 .",
    "but we could also apply the numerical scheme only to the  small  part @xmath43 and combine this symmetrically with the flow @xmath96 of the first term in  .",
    "this would yield the second order integrators @xmath97 and @xmath98 now , if we compared the local errors , we would get @xmath99 for the numerical scheme applied to the whole system , but @xmath100 for the splitting schemes . from this",
    "we observe that splitting can reduce a scheme s local error .    to see which of the two splitting methods is the better option",
    ", we first notice that for post - newtonian equations , the relativistic parts are non - separable , i.e. the hamiltonian can not be splitted in the form @xmath101 unfortunately , when a system is non - separable , symplectic schemes have to be implicit , see e.g. , @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "a splitting integrator of the form   has to solve a system of implicit equations twice per time step whereas a scheme of the form   leads to only one implicit system per step .",
    "thus , the splitting @xmath102 can be expected to be more efficient than @xmath103 .",
    "numerical experiments by @xcite have confirmed this so that we will only consider splittings of the form   in the following .",
    "the drawback of a splitting scheme is that no matter if we choose or  it is of second order even if the numerical scheme for the @xmath43 part is of ( much ) higher order .",
    "this can be overcome by clever composition : if we divide the step size @xmath14 into smaller intervals @xmath104 and set for some second order method @xmath105 @xmath106 the thus obtained scheme @xmath107 will be of higher order , provided that the @xmath108 satisfy specific conditions , see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter ii . if the underlying second order scheme @xmath105 is symplectic , @xmath107 , as a composition of many symplectic operations , will be so , too .",
    "let us briefly state another useful fact about the implementation of composition schemes : if we choose the second order basic method as @xmath109 , we have @xmath110 in the last step we could  merge  terms thanks to the group property @xmath111 which is valid for every exact flow , thus reducing the numerical effort .",
    "this would not be possible if we chose @xmath112 instead and , consequently , we found another advantage of splitting   over splitting  .",
    "one of the most popular composition methods is the state - of - the - art suzuki composition , @xcite , @xmath113 with @xmath114",
    "this yields a @xmath115th order method which is symmetric , i.e. @xmath116 whenever the underlying scheme is .",
    "after all the background information on splitting and composition methods , we are now in the position to present structure preserving integration schemes for the post - newtonian equations which have been considered so far",
    ".      we will present a poisson integrator in accordance with @xcite as well as a symplectic splitting scheme . in both cases",
    "we will use the implicit midpoint rule , already proposed in @xcite , which for any differential equation   has the form @xmath117 it is of second order and preserves symmetry and symplecticity , see , e.g. , @xcite .    * with the work of the previous two subsections and section  [ sec - iv ] , we construct a poisson integrator as follows : we use the midpoint rule to calculate the flow @xmath55 corresponding to the orbital relativistic contributions .",
    "then , we use the flow corresponding to the spin related parts as given in   and its adjoint @xmath118 and symmetrically combine them with @xmath55 in the form @xmath119 to obtain a numerical flow for all the relativistic parts @xmath43 in  .",
    "this numerical flow is symmetric and of second order as is any flow constructed in this way , see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter v. therefore , we can combine it with the exact flow of the newtonian part as in   to obtain the second order scheme @xmath120 this said , we can apply suzuki s composition   which yields the @xmath115th order symmetric poisson integrator @xmath121 * in order to construct a symplectic scheme , we first apply the transformation to canonical form of section  [ sec - iv ] .",
    "the hamiltonian in the new variables @xmath58 is still of the form  . as a consequence",
    ", we can proceed along the lines of the two subsections above .",
    "therefore , we apply the implicit midpoint rule to the whole relativistic contribution @xmath43 .",
    "this second order method can then be combined with the analytical solution of the kepler problem , leading to the symplectic second order splitting scheme @xmath122 again , we take use of suzuki s composition and arrive at the integrator @xmath123 which is symplectic and of order @xmath115 .    the nice ideas behind them and their mathematical bounty notwithstanding , the just presented structure preserving algorithms based on splitting methods are not very efficient : even in the case we use the group property   to  merge  terms as illustrated in   whenever it is possible , the symplectic integrator @xmath124 is still a composition of @xmath125 flows , five of which can only be computed via the solution of ten - dimensional implicit systems . using the poisson integrator   instead",
    ", we also have to calculate the midpoint rule five times .",
    "as it is only applied to the orbital motion , the implicit systems are reduced to @xmath126 dimensions .",
    "but for this we have to pay heavily because , taking everything together , we have to calculate @xmath127 flows during one time step , most of which are related to the spin contributions and require the calculations of numerous rotations , see @xcite .",
    "all these facts , which will be confirmed in the numerical experiments section below , make us look for a more efficient alternative to solve the post - newtonian equations of motion .",
    "this is where gauss collocation methods come into play .",
    "gauss - runge - kutta methods are in fact collocation methods . therefore , we give some background concerning these schemes .      given an interval @xmath128 $ ] , stages @xmath129 , and an initial - value problem of the form  , the polynomial @xmath130 of degree @xmath131 , satisfying @xmath132 is called a _ collocation polynomial_. in order to solve an initial - value problem by _ collocation _ , one has to find the polynomial @xmath130 which satisfies the collocation conditions @xmath133 , @xmath134 .",
    "this gives an approximate solution of the initial value problem after a time step @xmath14 by setting @xmath135 a detailed introduction to collocation methods can be found in @xcite .",
    "it can now readily be shown , e.g. , @xcite , that a collocation method is equivalent to an implicit @xmath131-stage runge - kutta scheme @xmath136 with coefficients chosen as @xmath137 here , @xmath138 denote the _ lagrange - polynomials _ of degree @xmath131 , @xmath139 depending on which set of stages @xmath129 is chosen , different collocation methods can be constructed . by setting @xmath140 with @xmath141 being the roots of the _ legendre - polynomial _ of degree @xmath131 , one obtains a _ gauss collocation method_. the order of this methods is @xmath142 , cf .",
    "@xcite , which is optimal in the sense that there are no other @xmath131-stage one - step methods that achieve a similar high order without further numerical ruse .",
    "in addition , gauss collocation methods are symplectic and time - reversible , as is proven in @xcite . due to all these properties ,",
    "gauss - runge - kutta methods are quite natural candidates for the solution of non - separable hamiltonian systems .      in order to employ gauss runge - kutta methods in post - newtonian simulations",
    ", we just have to conduct the transformation   of section  [ sec - iv ] and then apply a gauss collocation scheme to the whole system in the new coordinates @xmath58 .",
    "doing so , we will have to solve the system of implicit equations   for the inner stage values @xmath143 during each time step .",
    "this system has @xmath144 dimensions .",
    "contrary to the splitting schemes , we have to solve the system only once when calculating the step @xmath145 .",
    "besides , we can drastically reduce the effort for the solution of the implicit system if we take account of the following .",
    "an implicit system has to be solved iteratively .",
    "of course , the number of iterations necessary to obtain the solution depends on the distance between the starting guesses @xmath146 and the final values @xmath143 .",
    "all the better then , if there were a fast method to obtain guesses that are very close to the final values .",
    "this is possible for the gauss collocations implicit systems : given the inner stage values of the last step @xmath147 , @xmath148 , we set @xmath149 note that this requires no additional function evaluation as @xmath150 has had to be calculated in the previous step anyway .",
