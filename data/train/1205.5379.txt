    "theories breaking explicitly the particle number , like bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) are the simplest efficient ways to describe pairing correlations in physical systems .",
    "however , these theories suffer from some limitations especially when the number of particles becomes rather small as it is the case in mesoscopic systems like in nuclear physics @xcite or condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty is the sharp transition from normal to superfluid phases as the pairing strength increases .",
    "the second difficulty is a systematic underestimation of pairing correlations that increases when the particle number decreases .    in the last decades",
    ", several approaches have been used to overcome these difficulties . when the number of particle is small enough",
    ", the exact solution of the pairing problem is accessible by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xcite and/or using the secular equation originally proposed by richardson @xcite .",
    "accurate description of the ground state energy of superfluid systems with larger particle number can be obtained using either quantum monte - carlo technique ( see for instance @xcite ) or extending quasi - particle theories using variation after projection approaches @xcite ( for recent applications see @xcite ) .",
    "all of these methods are however rather involved and demanding in terms of computational power .",
    "the aim of the present work is to show that a perturbative approach can eventually provide a simpler and yet accurate alternative to treat the pairing problem .    in the following",
    ", standard perturbation theory is first recalled .",
    "it is then explained how to take advantage of both perturbative approaches and bcs / hfb theory .",
    "the importance of particle number restoration is finally highlighted .",
    "our starting point here is similar to the one used in refs .",
    "we assume a two - body pairing hamiltonian given by : @xmath0 here , @xmath1 denotes time - reversed pair .",
    "such an hamiltonian can be for instance constructed starting from a realistic self - consistent mean - field calculation providing single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements @xcite .",
    "here @xmath2 denotes the maximal number of accessible levels for the pairs of particles . in the following",
    ", we will consider the specific case of equidistant levels with @xmath3 with @xmath4 mev and a number of particles @xmath5 .",
    "as already noted some times ago @xcite and recently rediscussed @xcite , the two - body part @xmath6 can be treated perturbatively to provide an accurate description of the pairing problem in the weak pairing interaction regime .",
    "starting from the ground state @xmath7 of @xmath8 , that corresponds to the slater determinant obtained by occupying the lowest single - particle states while other excited states @xmath9 of @xmath8 can be obtained by considering particle - hole ( p - h ) , 2p-2h , ... excitations built on top of the @xmath7 . using second - order perturbation theory ,",
    "the ground state energy of @xmath10 reads : @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( with @xmath13 ) is the ground state energy of @xmath8 while @xmath14 is the standard second - order correction , that can be found in textbook : @xmath15 in the specific case considered here , i.e. eq . ( [ eq : tb ] ) , only 2p-2h states contribute to the second order correction .",
    "more precisely , the states @xmath16 could only differ from the ground state by one occupied pair above the fermi sea ( denoted by @xmath17 ) and one unoccupied pair below ( denoted by @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 and are eigenstates of @xmath8 with energy @xmath20 .",
    "this leads to @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "this expression has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite using a different approach based on the richardson - gaudin equation .",
    "it is known @xcite that standard perturbation theory provides an appropriate description in the weak coupling regime .    .",
    "the exact result solution ( red solid curve ) , bcs ( black dashed line ) , standard perturbation theory ( green open squares ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : standardpt ] ) and qp@xmath24 t theory with second order correction eq .",
    "( [ eq : qppt ] ) ( blue filled circles ) , are displayed . ]    in figure [ fig1:pert ] , an example of standard perturbation theory ( spt ) is presented for the @xmath25 particles and constant coupling case , i.e. @xmath26 . the correlation energy defined as the difference between the hartree - fock energy @xmath27 and the ground state energy @xmath28 obtained with stp are compared to the exact solution and bcs result . in the latter case , pairing correlation is non - zero only above the threshold value @xmath29 . as illustrated from fig .",
    "[ fig1:pert ] , standard perturbation theory matches with the exact result below the threshold but significantly underestimates the correlation for larger @xmath30 value .",
    "this aspect underlines the highly non - perturbative nature of the pairing quantum phase - transition . on the opposite , one of the advantage a theory like bcs is the possibility to incorporate non - perturbative physics even in the strong interaction case by breaking the u(1 ) symmetry associated to particle number conservation .",
    "to provide a proper description of both the weak and strong pairing strength regime , it seems quite natural to try to combine theories based on quasi - particles and perturbative approaches .",
    "this possibility has been explored long time ago in refs . @xcite mainly to discuss the removal of `` dangerous diagram '' occuring in normal perturbation theory .",
    "note that recently , it has also been revisited as a possible tool to perform ab - initio calculation in nuclei @xcite based on gorkov - green function formalism @xcite . in the following , it is assumed that the bcs / hfb approach has been applied in a preliminary study and that the hamiltonian ( [ eq : tb ] ) is written in the canonical basis of the quasi - particle ground state .",
    "then , the ground state takes the form @xmath31 in the hfb / bcs theory , the original hamiltonian is replaced by an effective hamiltonian that is conveniently written as : is replaced by @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath27 is the bcs / hfb ground state energy , while @xmath34 corresponds to the quasi - particle energy given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lagrange multiplier used to impose the average particle number while @xmath37 is the pairing gap ( for a detailed discussion see @xcite ) .    for even systems ,",
    "excited states of @xmath8 are 2 quasi - particle ( 2qp ) , 4 quasi - particle ( 4qp ) , ... excitations with respect to the ground state .",
    "the original hamiltonian @xmath10 contains many terms that are neglected in @xmath8 @xcite and that are responsible from the deviation between the quasi - particle and the exact solution .",
    "however , noting that : @xmath38 it can be anticipated that the main source of discrepancy is due to the coupling of @xmath39 with the 4qp states . some arguments showing that 4qp states should improved the description of pairing especially in the weak coupling regime have been given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "below , perturbation theory is applied assuming that @xmath8 ( eq . [ eq : hqp ] ) is the unperturbed hamiltonian while the perturbation @xmath6 is given by : @xmath40 @xmath6 couples the ground state with the 4qp states , defined as ( for @xmath41 ) : @xmath42 the present approach , that is a direct extension of standard perturbation theory , is called hereafter quasi - particle perturbation theory ( qp@xmath24 t ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : standardpt ] ) , the second order correction to the ground state energy is equal to : @xmath43 this correction properly extends eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr2 ] ) from the normal to the superfluid phase .",
    "indeed at the threshold value of @xmath30 , i.e. when @xmath44 , the 4qp states identify with 2p-2h excitations while : @xmath45 and the standard perturbation theory case is recovered .",
    "the result obtained with the qp@xmath24 t approach at second order in perturbation ( [ eq : qppt ] ) are displayed in figure [ fig1:pert ] with filled circles .",
    "note that below the bcs threshold , standard perturbation theory is used .",
    "the present approach can be regarded as a rather academic exercise but it turns out to provide a very simple way to extend mean - field theory based on quasi - particle states . in particular , it avoids the threshold problem of the latter and improves the description of correlation in the intermediate and strong coupling case .",
    "similarly to the original quasi - particle theory , the energy deduced from the qp@xmath24 t contains spurious contribution coming from the fact that the perturbed state does not preserves particle number . indeed , using standard formulas , to second order in perturbation",
    ", the ground state expresses as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , ... denotes the contribution to the state at @xmath50 order in perturbation and where @xmath51 above the bcs threshold , neither @xmath7 nor @xmath52 are eigenstates of the particle number operator .",
    "the most direct way to remove spurious contributions due to the mixing of different particle number is to introduce the operator @xmath53 @xmath54 that projects onto particle number @xmath55 .    .",
    "the exact result solution ( blue solid line ) , pav result ( green short - dashed line ) and the combination of projection and perturbation theories ( red filled circles ) are shown .",
    "the original bcs ( black long dashed line ) is also shown as a reference . ]     for the @xmath56 case . ]     for the @xmath57 case . ]",
    "the most straightforward way to combine projection with quasi - particle perturbation theory is to directly take the expectation value @xmath58 with @xmath59 and where @xmath60 is truncated at a given order in perturbation .",
    "this approach will be referred as the projected quasi - particle perturbation theory ( qp@xmath61 t ) in the following .",
    "when only the zero order in perturbation is retained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : statepert ] ) , the qp@xmath61 t identifies with the projection after variation ( pav ) that is commonly used , especially in the nuclear energy density functional approach ( edf ) @xcite .",
    "formulas useful to compute the expectation values of one- and two - body operators with projection are given in appendix [ app : proj ] .",
    "the projection is performed numerically using these expressions and the fomenko discretization procedure of the gauge - space integrals @xcite . here , @xmath62 discretization points have been used . note that the number of points can be reduced down to @xmath63 without changing the result .",
    "the correlation energies obtained for @xmath64 , @xmath25 and @xmath65 ( each time with @xmath66 ) using the second order qp@xmath61 t are shown in figures [ fig : projn2 ] , [ fig : projn8 ] and [ fig : projn12 ] respectively . in each case , the original bcs , the pav and the exact solution are also shown .",
    "the result of qp@xmath61 t almost superimposed with the exact solution .",
    "only a slight difference can be seen around the bcs threshold .    besides the energy , other observables can also be estimated . as an example , the quantity @xmath67 is shown in figure [ fig : occn8 ] as a function of single - particle energies , where @xmath68 are the occupation numbers of single - particle states .",
    "this quantity is a measure of the deviation from the independent particle picture where it is strictly zero for all states . the use of perturbation and projection considerably improves the description of one - body observables especially at intermediate coupling where the original bcs deviates significantly from the exact solution .",
    "in addition , even if the pav differs significantly from the exact case as it was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the extra mixing with the 4qp states compensates this drawback of pav .",
    "obtained with qp@xmath61 t ( filled blue circles ) as a function of single - particle energy for the @xmath56 case with @xmath69 ( a ) and @xmath70 ( b ) . in both case , the exact result ( red solid line ) the bcs result ( black dashed line ) and the pav result ( green open squares ) are shown . ]    in view of this agreement , it seems that the qp@xmath61 t does automatically select important many - body states , namely projected ground state and projected 4qp states , on which the true eigenstate decomposes .",
    "these states are highly non - trivial multi - particle multi - hole mixing that can also be describe by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian but that is much more demanding numerically . indeed ,",
    "the size of the 4qp hilbert space is @xmath71 while the size of the matrix to diagonalize the hamiltonian is ( @xmath72 $ ] ) .",
    "it is important to recall that here no diagonalization is required since the mixing coefficients are directly given by the quasi - particle perturbation theory , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mix ] ) .",
    "these features make the approach rather simple to implement on existing hfb / bcs codes to provide a much better approximation than the pav that is often currently used .",
    "in addition , by contrast to the variation after projection that is rather involved @xcite , no extra minimization is required .",
    "contrary to the exact diagonalization , the qp@xmath24 t and qp@xmath61 t can be performed even for large particle number . as an illustration , in figure [ fig : systn ] ,",
    "a systematic study of the correlation energy evolution obtained with some of the approaches presented above as the number of particle increases up to @xmath73 for the case @xmath74 . with standard diagonalization techniques ,",
    "the exact solution can hardly be obtained for @xmath75 .",
    "other approaches based on quasi - particle theories can be applied without difficulties .",
    "note however , that the qp@xmath61 t requires to perform more and more gauge angles integrations ( see appendix [ app : proj ] ) as @xmath55 increases making the calculations more time consuming with respect to the non - projected theories like bcs or qp@xmath24 t .    from this figure",
    ", we also note that differences between theories are seen only for rather small particle number @xmath76 , while above bcs and qp@xmath61 t can not be distinguished .",
    "however , as it has been discussed previously , for @xmath76 , the qp@xmath61 t is the only theory that can provide an excellent reproduction of the exact result when available .     for the bcs ( black dashed line ) , qp@xmath24 t ( green open squares ) and qp@xmath61 t ( blue filled circles ) .",
    "the exact case ( solid red line ) is also shown up to @xmath77 particles . ]",
    "in this work an extension of the standard many - body theory to treat the pairing problem is introduced . including the effect of 4qp pertubatively to extend usual bcs / hfb removes the problem of sharp transition from normal to superfluid phase and significantly improves the description of pairing .",
    "last , when restoration of particle number is performed within the perturbative approach , a perfect agreement with the exact results is found .",
    "this finding provide a direct proof of the importance of 4qp state to extend mean - field theories .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the quasi - particle perturbation theory can be implemented even for large particle number without special difficulties , making the technique rather attractive and much simpler than other approaches , like full diagonalization , variation after projection or quantum monte - carlo techniques .",
    "last , it is worth mentioning that the present technique can be directly and rather easily implemented on existing bcs / hfb codes @xcite to improve the description of pairing correlations .    recently , the use of gorkov - green function theory has been proposed @xcite as a possible tool to perform ab - initio calculation for nuclei .",
    "this theory provides a general formalism based on quasi - particle states . the result obtained in the present study",
    "are rather encouraging to pursue in that direction and that projection might be needed .",
    "we thank g. bertsch for helpful discussion and for providing the code to perform the exact diagonalization of the pairing problem .",
