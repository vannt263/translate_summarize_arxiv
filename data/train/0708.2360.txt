    "the concept of a black hole as a gravitationally collapsed object has effectively been with us since 1916 when schwarzschild first presented a solution to the einstein field equations for the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass . to date",
    ", the physics of these end - products has evolved both in breadth and depth , both theoretically and observationally , so much so that black holes are currently considered virtually discovered .",
    "while the horizon of a black hole ( a 2-sphere coordinate singularity ) provides the classical observational limit with regard to the dynamical evolution of the hole , it is widely believed that during spacetime collapse to form a black hole , the matter itself continues to implode unimpeded beyond the horizon towards a physical singularity .",
    "such perception has been motivated , from a theoretical view point , by the apparent absence of any known force that would otherwise counteract the action of gravity under the circumstances .    lately , the issue of whether or not spacetime singularities do exist is being revisited [ 1 ] .",
    "there are two main reasons for this .",
    "first there is the need to deal with the information loss paradox in black holes [ 2 ] .",
    "further , modern frameworks ( like string theory ) attempting to formulate a quantum theory of gravity assume the existence of fundamental length scale and thus seek singularity free spacetimes .",
    "there have been suggestions and speculations that singularity free spacetimes may actually be generic in nature [ 3 ] . indeed the concept of non - singular spacetimes actually dates back quite a while .",
    "for example , einstein [ 4 ] invoked a cosmological constant in his field equations in order keep the universe in equilibrium from collapse against its own matter - generated gravity .",
    "later , [ 5 ] sakharov considered the equation of state for a superdense fluid of the form @xmath6 and gliner suggested [ 6 ] that such a fluid could constitute the final state of gravitational collapse .",
    "currently , researchers  continue  to investigate the possibility of non - singular gravitational collapse .. for example , dymnikova ( see [ 7 ] and refs .",
    "therein ) has constructed a solution of the einstein field equations for a non - singular black hole containing at the core a fluid @xmath7 with anisotropic pressure @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "another line of investigation in this area initiated by markov [ 8 ] , suggests a limiting curvature approach .",
    "this idea has been explored further  by several authors , see for example [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] .",
    "the notion of non - singular collapse does lead ( among other things ) to some interesting speculations such as universes generated from interior of black holes [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] .",
    "non - singular collapse has also been extended to considerations of other modified forms of gravitational collapse such as boson stars [ 18 ] and gravitational vacuum stars ( gravastars ) [ 19 ] .",
    "a common feature in all these treatments is that the geometry of the spacetime in question is schwarschild at large @xmath11 and de sitter - like at small @xmath11  values .",
    "issues to do with direct matching of an external schwarzschild vacuum to an interior de sitter one have previously been discussed [ 20 ] from the point of view of the junction conditions [ 21 ] .",
    "in fact this approach has been employed to suggest modifications in some treatments [ 22 ] .",
    "if gravitational collapse is to result into a non - singular object with a de sitter - like core then junction constraints imply the matter field profile between or across the schwarzschild / de sitter boundary should have a radial dependent equation of state of the form @xmath12  that smoothly changes the matter - energy from a stiff fluid  to a de sitter - like fluid .",
    "in particular , inside the black hole where the radial coordinate becomes timelike such a field could take on a quintessential time dependant character , probably evolving as @xmath13 .    according to general relativity",
    "the 2-spheres inside of and concentric to the event horizon form a family of trapped surfaces @xmath14 , in that the null geodesics of both ingoing and outgoing families , orthogonal to each such a 2-surface , are converging .",
    "this means that the tangent vector field @xmath15 of any hypersurface - orthogonal null geodesic defined on any such 2-surfaces have a negative expansion ,  @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "thus spacetimes with horizons should contain trapped surfaces . in the 1960s , inquiries in the nature of spacetime singularities by penrose and hawking",
    "led to a quantitative theoretical description of gravitational collapse through the enunciation and proof of the famous singularity theorems [ 23 ] [ 24 ] .",
    "these studies were also extended by hawking and ellis [ 25 ] towards the concept of an initial singularity in cosmology .",
    "what the singularity theorems proved was that , subject to certain energy conditions , ( see also section 2.2 ) a closed trapped surface will contain a singularity .",
    "the question then is whether the geometry resulting from gravitational collapse can sustain trapped surfaces without a singularity .",
    "this is a reasonable question especially in view of the recent findings by ellis about a related phenomenon in cosmology [ 26 ] , namely that cosmic dynamics can allow closed trapped surfaces without leading to an initial singularity . in this paper",
    "we investigate whether it is in any way possible to have a family of trapped surfaces @xmath19 , resulting , say , from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse , that contain no future - directed singularity .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the ideas of convergence of null geodesics and how they lead to the concept of trapped surfaces .",
    "section 3 introduces the general class of spacetimes under consideration and discusses suitable coordinates . in section 4",
    "we compute the expansion of both the out - going and in - going null geodesics in a well known non - singular spacetime that is an exact solution of einstein equations .",
    "we use the results to demonstrate an unusual character that inside such a black hole there is a region  @xmath20 for which @xmath21 .",
    "the result violates conditions for the existence of a physical singularity . in section 5",
    "we provide a summary and conclude the paper .",
    "in this section we briefly review two concepts to be used in the forthcoming discussion , namely the concept of geodesic convergence and the concept of trapped surfaces .",
    "the propagation of timelike or null rays in a given geometry is governed by the raychaudhuri equation , @xmath22where @xmath23 is the expansion rate , @xmath24 is the shear rate and @xmath25 is the twist .",
    "@xmath26 is the ricii tensor .",
    "further , @xmath27 is the trace of the projection tensor for null geodesics while @xmath28 is identified with the surface gravity . for simplicity of treatment",
    ", we shall consider a twistless @xmath29 , shearless , @xmath30 spacetime that is type d in the petrov classification [ 27 ] .",
    "then the geodesic tangent vector can be chosen to be in the principal null direction .",
    "use of the einstein equations implies @xmath31where @xmath32 .",
    "2 shows that the expansion / convergence @xmath23 of a geodesic congruence will , among other things , depend on energy conditions . in particular , for convergence of  a null geodesic congruence , it is necessary ( and sufficient ) that fields influencing the geometry satisfy the weak energy condition , i.e. @xmath33 which leads to @xmath34 .",
    "the expansion @xmath23 of the congruence ( or the evolution of the principal null vector @xmath35 ) in a given geometry @xmath36 is defined by @xmath37thus with the knowledge of the metric , one can construct @xmath23 .      consider a spacelike 3-hyperface @xmath14 on which one has defined a metric @xmath38 and an extrinsic curvature tensor @xmath39 .",
    "the space @xmath40 can be foliated with a family of 2-surfaces , @xmath41 on which one can define hyperface - othorgonal null vectors @xmath42 .",
    "there are two such families of vectors defined on a surface @xmath41 , namely in - going and out - going rays .",
    "the expansion of the in - going congruence is always converging , while that of the out - going one can either diverge or converge depending on the circumstances . in the case that the expansion of both families of these tangent vectors are negative , @xmath43 , then the surface @xmath41 is said to be a trapped surface @xmath44 .",
    "there will be a marginally trapped surface(s ) @xmath45 in @xmath14 for which the expansion of the outgoing null geodesics defined on each point on @xmath45 are vanishing , @xmath46 .",
    "for black holes in the process of formation , this surface is the apparent horizon .",
    "it defines the outer boundary of the family of closed trapped surfaces @xmath47 in this geometry .",
    "the existence of trapped surfaces in black holes ( along with other conditions ) was used by penrose and hawking to predict that such spacetimes should have singularities .",
    "briefly , the main argument goes something like this [ 26 ] [ 28 ] .",
    "a given spacetime will contain at least one incomplete geodesic , provided :    \\(1 ) the fields satisfy the wec , @xmath48 ;    \\(2 ) there are no closed timelike loops and    \\(3 ) there exists at least one trapped surface @xmath47 ,    geodetic incompleteness then leads to the existence of a singularity .    in our treatment",
    "we show that for the spacetime in consideration the trapped region is also bounded from inside so that for @xmath49 @xmath50 one finds @xmath51 .",
    "this makes such a  spacetime geodetically complete ( no cusping of the in - going and out - going geodesics ) which violates some of the above conditions for the existence of singularity .",
    "this is a key result of the paper .",
    "in this work we investigate whether the spacetime geometry consequent to gravitational collapse can support trapped surfaces without creating singularities .",
    "we assume that the final collapse has resulted in the formation of an event horizon that envelopes the matter fields .",
    "then the real and apparent horizons coincide to locate the _ outer _ marginally trapped surface .",
    "further , for simplicity , we assume the end - product to admit static , spherically symmetric solutions . in schwarzschild coordinates the line element for the spacetime can then take the form @xmath52where @xmath53 and here the mass @xmath54 is a function of the radial coordinate and is distributed in some region @xmath55 .",
    "such a line element is general enough to contain our spacetimes of interest .",
    "there are two boundary requirements for the spacetime of our interest :    \\(i )",
    "the first is that for large radial distance @xmath56 the spacetime be asymptotically schwarzschild @xmath57here @xmath58 is the total mass and @xmath59 gives the surface of the matter fields , with @xmath60 .",
    "\\(ii ) the second requirement is that the spacetime be asymptotically de sitter @xmath61for @xmath62 .",
    "here @xmath63signals the onset of de sitter behavior and is given by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the upper - bound on the density of the fields and @xmath32 .    the two boundary requirements in eqs .",
    "( [ metrics ] ) and ( [ metricdes ] ) imply that there is an interior region given by @xmath66 for which @xmath67 .",
    "the entire spacetime must therefore satisfy regularity conditions at the two interfaces @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these conditions guarantee ( i ) continuity of the mass function and ( ii ) continuity of the pressure across the interfacing hyperfaces .",
    "thus at each interface we must have for @xmath70 that @xmath71 _ { \\mid r = r_{i}}=0,\\]]and @xmath72 _ { \\mid r = r_{i}}=0,\\]]where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 refer to the exterior and interior values respectively",
    ".    it will be convenient to transform ( eq . [ metricgen ] ) into coordinates suitable for discussing null geodesics and which cover all the regions of interest .",
    "note that in this a spacetime , null fields propagate along geodesics given by @xmath76where @xmath77 is an affine parameter .",
    "the radial geodesics of a massless particle are therefore given by @xmath78is the a regge - wheeler - like tortoise coordinate in this spacetime and @xmath79 .",
    "one can set up an eddington - finkelstein - like double null coordinate system @xmath80 given by @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "note that towards the future , the radial coordinate increases along constant @xmath83  and decreases along @xmath84 so that @xmath83 and @xmath84 are out - going and in - going null coordinates , respectively .",

    "one can compare this situation with that for the spacetime under consideration .",
    "one notices that in the region @xmath172 of the dymnikova spacetime ( see fig .",
    "1 ) the expansion of the outgoing mode @xmath0 starts off decreasing as in the schwarzschild case .",
    "however , near @xmath176 it reaches a minimum and and thereafter , for smaller radii , @xmath0 begins increasing as the metric begins deviating significantly from that of schwarzschild .",
    "eventually , at @xmath69 ( in reality at @xmath177 ) , @xmath0 vanishes , to signify the presence an inner marginally trapped surface ( and hence horizon ) at this point . in figure 2",

    "thereafter , @xmath180 grows without bound in the negative direction .",
    "it is notable that @xmath181 remains bounded in the trapped region @xmath167 and does not tend to @xmath191 .",

    "in this work we have investigated the question of whether in gravitational collapse spacetime can sustain trapped surfaces without a singularity . as a concrete example we have considered the dymnikova spacetime , which is  a static spherically symmetric solution of the einstein field equations with a de sitter - like fluid at the core .",

    "null congruences do not converge without bound and both @xmath0 and @xmath181 have a minimum .",
    "further , there is a region @xmath5 including the black hole center @xmath3 , in which the spacetime is regular , with converging in - going congruences @xmath170 and diverging out - going congruences , @xmath169 so that @xmath171 .",
    "these results suggest that the trapped region @xmath19 : ( a ) does not enclose a singularity and , ( b ) may not necessarily include the origin .    in @xcite",

    "generally , these arguments suggest that if gravitational collapse were to proceed with some phase transition that leads to the creation of some de sitter - like fluid @xmath204 at the collapse core deep inside the schwarzschild surface then it is plausible that a trapped region with no singularity would result inside the black hole ."
