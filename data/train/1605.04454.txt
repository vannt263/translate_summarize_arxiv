    "<S> a detailed calculation is presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ; here we outline the main steps . </S>",
    "<S> we first write down the action @xmath51 $ ] of the odd - frequency superconductor in terms of the nambu fermion fields @xmath52 minimally coupled to the vector potential @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> we then integrate out the fermion fields , which yields an effective action @xmath53 $ ] for the vector potential alone . </S>",
    "<S> in linear response theory , the current @xmath47 is given by the derivative of the effective action with respect to the vector potential , @xmath54 and contains two parts , the diamagnetic current @xmath55 and the paramagnetic current @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the effective action to second order in the vector potential , which yields the london equation ( [ london ] ) . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we consider the limits @xmath24 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> in the zero - temperature limit , the diamagnetic current is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the electron density of the decoupled spin - polarized wire . </S>",
    "<S> in the presence of the coupling @xmath8 between the spin - polarized wire and the mzm , the diamagnetic response is simply that of the decoupled wire  @xcite plus a small correction of order @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this is to be expected since the total number of electrons in the wire is not conserved in the presence of the coupling ( [ nanowiremajoranacoupling2 ] ) to the mzm . for the paramagnetic current , </S>",
    "<S> results differ depending on whether one is in the @xmath61 limit or the @xmath62 limit . in the @xmath61 limit </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath63\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while in the @xmath62 limit , we have @xmath64 apart from the logarithmic term in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ jparatlldelta ] ) , the two small energy scales @xmath36 and @xmath14 act as an infrared cutoff for each other .    adding the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions </S>",
    "<S> , we see that when the spin - polarized wire and the mzm are decoupled ( @xmath65 ) both contributions exactly cancel each other and the superfluid density of the wire is zero , as expected . for @xmath66 , the paramagnetic contribution to the superfluid density is proportional to either @xmath67 or @xmath68 , which is much greater than unity in the limit considered , while the diamagnetic contribution is proportional to @xmath69 , which is much less than unity . as a result , the paramagnetic response overwhelms the diamagnetic response , and the superfluid density is @xmath70 , & t\\ll\\delta , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\displaystyle 1 , & \\delta\\ll t , \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected the small diamagnetic contribution proportional to @xmath69 . the superfluid density of the spin - polarized wire is thus negative , which is a hallmark of odd - frequency superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the dominance of the paramagnetic contribution can be traced back to the presence of gapless bogoliubov quasiparticles at the fermi points in the odd - frequency superconducting state . in the limit @xmath31 , </S>",
    "<S> the density of states at the fermi level diverges [ see fig .  [ bandstructuredos](b ) ] and the paramagnetic response dominates . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the superfluid density diverges at low temperatures , in stark contrast with its smooth behavior as @xmath71 in conventional superconductors  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> a negative superfluid density implies a paramagnetic meissner effect  @xcite , whereby an applied magnetic flux is enhanced rather than screened by the induced supercurrent . in the setup of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ meissner2 ] , the paramagnetic supercurrent leads to an attractive force between the odd - frequency superconducting ring and a magnet [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ meissner2](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast with the repulsive force between a conventional superconductor and a magnet [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ meissner2](a ) ] , which leads to the phenomenon of superconducting levitation  @xcite . to see this </S>",
    "<S> , we treat the magnet in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ meissner2 ] as a magnetic dipole with dipole moment @xmath72 pointing towards the superconducting ring . </S>",
    "<S> the field created by this magnet induces a supercurrent in the superconducting ring . </S>",
    "<S> we treat the superconducting ring as a magnetic dipole also , where the magnitude of the corresponding dipole moment @xmath73 is given by the induced supercurrent times the area of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> because the supercurrent is paramagnetic , @xmath73 points in the same direction as @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> besides inducing the supercurrent , the magnet exerts a force on the superconducting ring that can be approximated as the force between two magnetic dipoles . assuming that the ring is directly above the magnet , the force on the ring is given by @xmath75 , where the distance @xmath76 between the ring and the magnet is assumed to be much greater than the radius of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the superconducting ring feels an attractive force towards the magnet , a phenomenon one could call superconducting anti - levitation .    </S>",
    "<S> we now give a rough estimate of the magnitude of the paramagnetic meissner current ( [ london ] ) . for an al - coated inas nanowire  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the induced topological superconducting gap is @xmath77  k. for a wire length of 1  @xmath78 m , this yields a mzm splitting @xmath79  k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spin - polarized nanowire can be made of ferromagnetic metals such as co , fe , or ni . the coupling @xmath8 between the mzm and the ferromagnetic nanowire depends on the details of the sample . since mzms are localized at the ends of the wire , the broadening due to normal lead coupling @xmath8 is given by @xmath80  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath81 is the dimensionless normal - state conductance of the contact . </S>",
    "<S> assuming @xmath82 , we estimate an upper bound for majorana coupling as @xmath83  k. the fermi velocity in a co ferromagnetic nanowire is @xmath84  m / s  @xcite , which we can use to extract the ratio of electron density @xmath85 to mass @xmath86 as @xmath87 . threading one flux quantum @xmath88 into a ring of circumference @xmath89  @xmath78 m gives the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath90 on the ring . using these values </S>",
    "<S> , we find approximate upper bounds for the paramagnetic meissner current as @xmath91  na at temperature @xmath92  mk in the @xmath61 regime and @xmath93  na at temperature @xmath94  k in the @xmath62 regime . </S>",
    "<S> we believe such currents are within experimental measurement capabilities .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a platform to engineer a uniform , pure odd - frequency superconductor by coupling majorana zero modes to a spin - polarized nanowire . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal requires neither disorder nor strong interactions , ensures thermodynamic stability , and does not require fine tuning of parameters since the presence of majorana zero modes is protected by the topological gap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be generalized to higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we show by explicit computation that the static superconducting order parameter vanishes and the superfluid density is negative . </S>",
    "<S> the latter implies that our system exhibits the paramagnetic meissner effect , which leads to an attractive force between an odd - frequency superconducting ring and an external magnet .    </S>",
