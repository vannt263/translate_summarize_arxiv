    "recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in entanglement related quantities ( and quantum information concepts in general ) as new tools to understand the behavior of quantum many body systems  @xcite . very recently",
    "the entanglement spectrum  @xcite ( es ) has established itself as a new prominent research topic .",
    "considering the bipartition of a system into parts @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the es , @xmath5 , is constructed from the schmidt decomposition @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the ground state , and the states @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) provide an orthonormal basis for subsystem @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the es @xmath5 can also be interpreted as the spectrum of the so called entanglement hamiltonian @xmath10 , where the reduced density matrix @xmath11 is obtained by tracing out part @xmath4 in the full system density matrix @xmath12 .    while in one dimensional ( 1d ) systems the structure of es",
    "is related to integrability  @xcite and ( for gapless systems ) to conformal invariance  @xcite , higher dimensions are by far less explored . in particular , most of the recent literature on two dimensional ( 2d ) systems focused on es properties in topological phases  @xcite .    in more standard ( i.e. non topological ) 2d systems ,",
    "although some results are available  @xcite , much less is known .",
    "nevertheless , it has been established recently that in systems displaying ordered ground states ( in the thermodynamic limit ) , with breaking of a _ continuous _ symmetry , the lower part of the es is in correspondence with the so called `` tower of states '' ( tos ) spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this describes the low energy structure of _ finite size _",
    "spectra in systems that spontaneously break a continuous symmetry . in combination with exact diagonalization techniques , tower of states",
    "spectroscopy is routinely used to detect symmetry broken phases  @xcite .",
    "so far tower of states structures in es have only been observed numerically in the superfluid phase of the 2d bose - hubbard model  @xcite , where the formation of a bose condensate is associated with the breaking of a @xmath13 gauge symmetry ( reflecting conservation of the total number of particles in finite systems ) . the resulting tos spectrum , however , ( and the lower part of the es thereof ) is `` trivial '' with one level ( excitation ) per particle number sector  @xcite .",
    "richer behavior is expected in @xmath0-broken phases , where different @xmath0 breaking patterns ( i.e. nel states ) give rise to different structures in the energy tos .",
    "for instance , for nel order with more than two ferromagnetic sublattices ( associated with full breaking of @xmath0 ) the spin resolved tos spectrum exhibits a family of levels ( i.e. more than one level ) in each spin sector  @xcite .    in this article",
    "we demonstrate that this richer structure is reflected in the lower part of the es , providing a more stringent check of the correspondence between tower of states and entanglement spectrum . to be specific",
    ", we focus on the 2d heisenberg model with nearest and next - nearest neighbor interaction ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively ) .",
    "we consider both the kagom ( kha ) and the triangular lattice ( tha ) , restricting ourselves to ferromagnetic @xmath2 ( @xmath14 ) , to ensure a magnetically ordered ground state on both lattices . in order to take advantage of the @xmath0 invariance of the model",
    "we employ non - abelian ( @xmath0-symmetric ) dmrg simulations .",
    "our results are summarized as follows . in both the @xmath1-@xmath2 kha and tha , in the symmetry",
    "broken phase , the lower part of the es ( resolved with respect to the block spin @xmath15 ) sharply reflects the same tos structure as the physical bulk hamiltonian .",
    "low - lying es levels are organized into families , each corresponding to a different @xmath15 and containing more than one level ( in contrast to the bose - hubbard model where the tos structure is `` trivial '' ) .",
    "the counting of tos levels in each @xmath15 sector reflects the corresponding counting in the energy tos .",
    "the tos - like structure is divided from higher levels by an entanglement gap , which remains finite ( or vanishes logarithmically ) in the thermodynamic limit ( as found in the bose - hubbard es  @xcite ) .",
    "all es levels below the gap are degenerate in the thermodynamic limit , and their finite size behavior is fully understood within the framework of the tos - es correspondence .",
    "oppositely , for finite systems , es levels within each tos family are not exactly degenerate ( similarly to energy tos  @xcite ) giving rise to intriguing entanglement ( tos ) substructures .",
    "the main features of tos levels ( tos substructures , finite size behaviors ) are quantitatively characterized by an approximate mapping between the entanglement hamiltonian and the physical bulk hamiltonian .",
    "finally , as an additional point , we investigate the effect of boundary conditions on the tos structure . to this purpose",
    "we consider the es of the @xmath1-@xmath2 kha ( @xmath16 ) on the torus geometry , which has the net effect of introducing two boundaries ( edges ) between subsystem @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we find that in @xmath0 broken phases the structure of the es is weakly affected by boundaries , reflecting the bulk origin of tos excitations .",
    "this is dramatically different in gapped phases  @xcite or in fqh systems  @xcite where the es obtained from bipartitions with multiple edges can be constructed combining single - edge es .    on the methodological side",
    ", our analysis suggests that entanglement tos spectroscopy , combined with @xmath0 symmetric dmrg , could provide a potentially powerful tool to detect and characterize magnetically ordered ground states .",
    "also , while conventional energy tos spectroscopy requires the calculation of several excited states ( which is computationally expensive in dmrg ) , es are readily obtained from _ ground state _",
