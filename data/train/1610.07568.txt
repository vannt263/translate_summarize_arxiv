    "understanding nuclei and dense baryonic matter at the interface with the underlying theory of the strong interaction , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is one of the pending challenges in nuclear many - body theory .",
    "the present review focuses on this issue , by combining basic symmetry principles and the symmetry breaking pattern of low - energy qcd with a functional renormalization group ( frg ) approach . in this context",
    ", the frg offers an efficient non - perturbative method for investigating important fluctuations beyond mean - field approximation .",
    "but before entering this main theme , it is useful for general guidance to start with a brief survey of the role that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking plays in defining scales , identifying relevant degrees of freedom , designing instructive models and introducing chiral effective field theory for applications to nuclear systems .",
    "qcd starts out with quarks and gluons as fundamental fermion and gauge boson degrees of freedom . at momentum",
    "scales exceeding several gev ( corresponding to short distance scales , @xmath0 fm ) , qcd is indeed a theory of weakly - coupled quarks and gluons for which perturbative methods are applicable . on the other hand ,",
    "in the low - energy limit and at momentum scales well below 1 gev ( corresponding to distances relevant for nuclear physics , @xmath1 fm ) , qcd is governed by color confinement and dynamical ( spontaneous ) breaking of chiral symmetry , a global symmetry of qcd that is exact in the limit of massless quarks and explicitly broken by the non - zero quark masses generated at the higgs scale .",
    "investigations of lattice qcd thermodynamics at zero quark chemical potential have arrived at the following conclusions .",
    "a transition from color confinement in hadrons to a deconfined quark - gluon phase is signalled by the behaviour of the polyakov loop , accompanied by rapid changes of the energy density and of related quantities @xcite .",
    "furthermore the temperature dependence of the chiral ( quark ) condensate , @xmath2 , displays a transition from the unbroken ( wigner - weyl ) realisation of chiral symmetry to the nambu - goldstone realisation with spontaneously broken symmetry @xcite .",
    "these two transitions ( not phase transitions but continuous crossovers ) take place in the same narrow temperature range , @xmath3 gev .",
    "mev @xcite . ]",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking implies the existence of pseudoscalar nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons . in the limit of exact chiral symmetry with zero - mass quarks",
    "these ng bosons are massless . for two quark flavors ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) with nearly zero masses ,",
    "the goldstone bosons of chiral symmetry are identified with the isospin triplet of pions .",
    "explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the non - zero but small @xmath4 and @xmath5 quark masses ( @xmath6 mev at a renormalization scale of 2 gev @xcite ) moves the pion mass to its physical value , @xmath7 mev , with @xmath8 proportional to @xmath9 in leading order .",
    "low - energy qcd in the matter - free vacuum is thus realized as a ( chiral ) effective field theory of the active , light degrees of freedom : the pions as pseudo - goldstone bosons . in the low - energy , long - wavelength limit",
    ", nambu - goldstone bosons have the property that their interactions with one another and with any massive hadron are weak , governed by couplings proportional to space - time derivatives of the ng boson fields plus small symmetry - breaking mass terms . in this limit",
    "perturbative methods can be applied ( chiral perturbation theory - chpt ) , based on a systematic expansion in powers of momentum , energy and quark masses as `` small '' parameters @xcite .    in the low - energy and low - density domain",
    "accessed by currently available experimental probes , chiral effective field theory as outlined above in terms of goldstone boson fields _ alone _ provides a sufficiently powerful framework also for a highly successful description of nuclear interactions @xcite .",
    "this is the starting point for a systematic approach to nuclear many - body dynamics and thermodynamics at densities and temperatures well within the hadronic , `` confined '' phase of qcd @xcite .      within this introductory survey ,",
    "let us now briefly recall how the special role of the pion emerges through the nambu - goldstone mechanism of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd . historically , our understanding of the pion as an ng boson emerged @xcite in the pre - qcd era of the 1960 s and culminated in the current algebra approach @xcite ( combined with the pcac relation for the pion ) .",
    "inspired by the bcs theory of superconductivity , nambu and jona - lasinio ( njl ) @xcite developed a model that helped clarify the dynamics behind spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the formation of pions as nambu - goldstone bosons . following the logic of the njl model",
    "gives a hint at the link to the underlying qcd degrees of freedom .",
    "we start from the color current of quarks , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the quark fields with @xmath12 components representing their spin , color and flavor degrees freedom @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are the generators of the @xmath16 color gauge group .",
    "one can make the additional ansatz that the distance over which color propagates is restricted to a short correlation length @xmath17 .",
    "then the interaction between low - momentum quarks , mediated by the coupling of the quark color current to the gluon fields , can be schematically viewed as a local coupling between their color currents : @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents an effective coupling strength proportional to the square of the dimensionless qcd coupling , @xmath20 , averaged over the relevant distance scale , in combination with the squared correlation length .    given the local interaction in eq.([eq : lint1 ] ) , a model lagrangian for the quark fields , @xmath21 arises by integrating out the gluon degrees of freedom and absorbing them in the local four - fermion interaction @xmath22 . in this way",
    "the local @xmath16 gauge symmetry of qcd is replaced by a global one .",
    "confinement is lost but all other symmetries of qcd are maintained . in eq.([eq : njl ] ) the mass matrix @xmath9 incorporates the small `` bare '' quark masses . in the limit @xmath23 the lagrangian ( [ eq : njl ] ) has a chiral symmetry of left- and right - handed quarks , @xmath24 , just like the original qcd lagrangian for @xmath25 massless quark flavors .",

    "( [ gapeq ] ) requires a momentum - space cutoff @xmath39 beyond which the interaction is `` turned off '' .",
    "the strong non - perturbative interactions polarize the vacuum and generate a condensate of quark - antiquark pairs , thereby turning an initially point - like quark with its small bare mass @xmath9 into a dressed quasi - particle with a size on the order of @xmath40 @xcite .    solving bethe - salpeter equations in the color - singlet quark - antiquark channels ,",
    "the lightest mesons are generated as quark - antiquark excitations of the correlated qcd ground state with its condensate structure .",
    "many instructive calculations have been performed previously in the three - flavor njl model @xcite .",
    "this model has an undesired @xmath41 symmetry .",
    "the axial @xmath42 anomaly of qcd reduces this symmetry to @xmath43 , i.e. , chiral symmetry in conjunction with baryon number conservation .",

    "fig.[fig:1 ] shows the symmetry breaking pattern resulting from such a calculation of the pseudoscalar meson spectrum .",
    "assuming massless @xmath46 and @xmath47 quarks , the pseudoscalar octet emerges as a set of massless nambu - goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral @xmath48 symmetry , while the anomalously broken @xmath42 symmetry drives the flavor - singlet @xmath49 away from the ng boson sector . the inclusion of finite quark masses that explicitly break chiral symmetry shifts the pseudoscalar ( @xmath50 ) nonet mesons into their empirically observed positions , including @xmath49-@xmath51 mixing .",
    "the pion mass is related to the scalar quark condensate and bare quark masses through the famous gell - mann  oakes  renner relation @xcite : @xmath52 derived from current algebra and pcac .",

    "the non - zero pion mass , @xmath59 , is a reflection of the explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the small quark masses , with @xmath60 . unlike the pion mass and decay constant , the quark masses @xmath61 as well as the quark condensate @xmath62 are scale - dependent quantities and therefore not separately observable .",
    "only their product is renormalization group invariant . at a renormalization scale of 2 gev , a typical average quark mass @xmath63 mev goes together with a condensate @xmath64    the quark masses set primary scales in qcd , and their classification into `` light '' and `` heavy '' quarks determines very different physics phenomena .",
    "the heavy quarks ( the @xmath65 , @xmath66 and  within limits ",
    "the @xmath67 quarks ) , whose reciprocal masses offer a natural small parameter , can be treated in non - relativistic approximations ( that is , expansions of observables in powers of @xmath68 ) .",
    "the sector of the light quarks ( the @xmath4 , @xmath5 quarks and  to some extent  the @xmath47 quark ) , on the other hand , is governed by quite different principles and rules . evidently , the light quark masses themselves are now small parameters to be compared with a `` large '' scale of dynamical origin . in the hadronic sector",
    "this large scale is characterized by a mass gap of about 1 gev separating the qcd vacuum from nearly all of its excitations , with the exception of the pseudoscalar meson octet shown in fig.[fig:1 ] .",

    "its temperature dependence , @xmath71 , reflects a second - order chiral phase transition for @xmath26 massless quarks , with @xmath72 at a critical temperature @xmath73 gev .",
    "this transition becomes a crossover when chiral symmetry is explicitly broken by non - zero quark masses @xmath9 .",
    "while njl type models ( and their bosonized analogues , chiral quark - meson models ) provide an instructive picture of the dynamics behind spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , they have the principal deficiency of missing confinement .",
    "introducing the polyakov loop in pnjl models improves the situation by suppressing color - non - singlet degrees of freedom in the `` hadronic '' phase at temperatures below @xmath74 .",
    "but confinement also implies clustering in space , such as the localization of three valence quarks in a small volume to form a baryon , for which there is no primary mechanism in standard pnjl models .",
    "this is obviously of some significance when studying the phase diagram of strong - interaction matter at finite baryon densities .",
    "many ( p)njl and related mean - field calculations of isospin - symmetric matter predict the existence of a first - order chiral phase transition . in a @xmath75 phase diagram ( temperature @xmath76 vs. baryon chemical potential @xmath77 ) , this 1st order transition has a critical end point from where it extends downward to low temperatures and meets the @xmath78 axis around @xmath79 gev .",

    "the only empirically founded phase transition discussed in this region is the one from a nuclear fermi liquid to an interacting gas of nucleons @xcite .",
    "motivated by such considerations , the focus of the present report will be on nuclear thermodynamics as it sets important constraints for exploring the qcd phase diagram in the region of baryon densities around and well above the density of equilibrium nuclear matter , and at temperatures @xmath81 mev within the hadronic phase .",
    "apart from the lightest mesons , the relevant fermionic degrees of freedom in this domain are obviously nucleons ( rather than quarks ) which act as `` heavy '' sources of the pion field .",
    "upon bosonization , the njl model with @xmath26 flavors is demonstrated to be equivalent to a linear sigma model @xcite .",

    "the mass shift is repulsive for @xmath648 and attractive for @xmath658 .      at zero chemical potential chiral symmetry",
    "is restored in its wigner - weyl realisation at high temperatures @xmath662 gev @xcite .",
    "it is presumably also restored at large baryon chemical potential and low temperature , although the critical value of @xmath306 at which this transition takes place is unknown and may be extremely large .",
    "calculations using nambu  jona - lasinio or chiral quark - meson models commonly predict a first - order chiral phase transition at vanishing temperature for quark chemical potentials , @xmath663 , around 300mev ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "translated into baryonic chemical potentials , @xmath664 , chiral symmetry would be restored close to the equilibrium point of normal nuclear matter , @xmath665 mev .",
    "nuclear physics with its well - established empirical phenomenology teaches us that this can obviously not be the case .",
    "however , these calculations  apart from the fact that they operate with ( quark ) degrees of freedom that are not appropriate for dealing with the hadronic phase of qcd  work mostly on the basis of the mean - field approximation .",
    "it is therefore of great importance to examine how fluctuations beyond mean - field can change this scenario . using the frg - chnm approach",
    ", we shall indeed point out that the mean - field approximation can not be trusted : it is likely that fluctuations shift the chiral phase transition to extremely high baryon densities .",
    "consider the chiral condensate , @xmath2 , as a function of temperature and baryon density .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem in combination with the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation gives the in - medium chiral condensate in the form @xmath666 where @xmath667 is the free - energy density .",

    ", cheft calculations of the in - medium chiral condensate have been performed to three - loop order by directly computing the dependence of @xmath670 on the pion mass @xcite , while @xmath671 as function of baryon density and temperature has been calculated in refs.@xcite using the chnm model .",
    "fig23a    fig23b    in mean - field approximation @xcite , chiral symmetry gets restored in a first - order transition at a density as low as @xmath672 .",
    "once fluctuations are taken into account @xcite , the chiral restoration transition is shifted to chemical potentials well beyond @xmath673 gev or densities exceeding @xmath674 .",
    "similar trends are found in cheft calculations of the in - medium chiral condensate .",
    "results of both cheft and chnm calculations are displayed in fig.[fig : sigmamu ] .",
    "note that the first - order liquid - gas transition leaves its trace also in the chiral order parameter , featuring a discontinuity at @xmath516 mev .",

    "we show for comparison the chiral condensate as computed in cheft .",
    "one observes that both the chiral condensate in cheft and the chiral order parameter @xmath98 in the frg - chnm model are in close correspondence and run almost in parallel .",
    "it is instructive to examine the order parameter @xmath98 in the @xmath76@xmath306 phase diagram in the neighbourhood of the liquid - gas transition .",
    "figure[fig : sigmacontour ] shows contours for given values of @xmath671 calculated in the frg - chnm model including fluctuations .",
    "it is evident that within the region of temperatures @xmath81 mev and baryon chemical potentials @xmath677 gev , the order parameter stays non - zero and there is no tendency towards a chiral phase transition .     calculated in the frg - chnm model @xcite.,width=264 ]    for pure neutron matter at @xmath303 ,",
    "the chiral condensate has been calculated previously within ( perturbative ) chiral effective field theory @xcite .",
    "chiral nuclear forces treated up to four - body interactions at n@xmath221lo @xcite were shown to work moderately against the leading linearly decreasing condensate with increasing density around @xmath678 , with a rate of stabilization less pronounced than in symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "it is instructive at this point to investigate the density dependence of the chiral order parameter @xmath98 in neutron matter within the frg - chnm model .",
    "the non - perturbative frg approach permits extrapolating to higher densities .",
    "results are presented in fig.[fig : chiral_restoration_nm ] . in mean - field approximation",
    ", the order parameter @xmath671 shows a first - order chiral phase transition at a density of about @xmath674 .",
    "however , the situation changes qualitatively when fluctuations are included using the frg framework .",
    "the chiral order parameter now turns into a continuous function of density , with no indication of a phase transition .",
    "even at five to six times nuclear saturation density the order parameter still remains at about forty percent of its vacuum value . only at densities as large",
    "as @xmath679 does the expectation value of @xmath98 show a more rapid tendency towards a crossover to restoration of chiral symmetry in its wigner  weyl mode .",
    "but this is even beyond the range of densities that may be reached in the cores of neutron stars .",
    "we thus observe a huge influence of higher order fluctuations involving pauli blocking effects in multiple pion - exchange processes and multi - nucleon correlations at high densities . with neutron matter remaining in a phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry even up to very high densities",
    ", this encourages further - reaching applications and tests of the frg - chnm approach in constructing an equation of state for the interior of neutron stars .        both the present approach and the chiral effective field theory treatment rely on the assumption that , even in compressed baryonic matter , the proper baryonic degrees of freedom are nucleons rather than liberated quarks .",
    "this may in fact not be altogether unrealistic .",
    "models based on chiral symmetry describe the nucleon as a compact valence quark core ( typically with a radius of about 1/2 fm ) surrounded by a mesonic cloud @xcite .",
    "the meson cloud determines most of the proton r.m.s .",
    "charge radius of 0.87 fm .",
    "for the neutron the description in terms of core and cloud is analogous except that the electric charges of quark core and meson cloud now add up to form an overall neutral object .",
    "a similar picture emerges in chiral soliton models of the nucleon @xcite which feature a compact baryonic core with a radius @xmath680 fm .",
    "this half - fermi scale figures also in the repulsive core observed in lattice qcd calculations of the nucleon - nucleon force @xcite .",
    "now , even at densities of neutron matter as high as @xmath681 , the average distance between two neutrons is still about 1 fm , hence the baryonic cores do not yet overlap appreciably at densities characteristic of neutron star interiors . of course , the pionic fields surrounding the baryonic sources are highly inhomogeneous and polarized in compressed matter , but this effect is properly dealt with in the frg treatment of pionic fluctuations .",
    "important aspects of nucleon structure beyond the `` pointlike '' limit and respective changes in the strongly interacting medium enter in terms of nucleon polarizabilities involving low - lying @xmath202 and @xmath682 excitations of the nucleon .",
    "it is therefore perhaps not so surprising that an equation of state based entirely on nucleons and pionic degrees of freedom works well for neutron stars , once repulsive correlations and many - body forces jointly contribute to producing a sufficiently stiff eos .",
    "in this report , a chiral model of pions interacting with nucleons ( chnm ) has been combined with the functional renormalization group ( frg ) as an efficient approach to the thermodynamics of nuclear and neutron matter .",
    "the effective potential of this model , non - linear in the chiral fields , has altogether five parameters that are constrained by known ground state properties of nuclear matter .",
    "solving the frg flow equations , a non - perturbative treatment of fluctuations beyond mean mean - field approximation is possible .",
    "fluctuations of primary importance involve pionic degrees of freedom and nucleonic particle - hole excitations around the filled fermi sea .",
    "these fluctuations incorporate one- and two - pion exchange mechanisms plus emergent three - body forces as they also appear in perturbative treatments using chiral effective field theory .",
    "the non - linear structure of the effective potential is even richer in content as it generates iterations to all order of such mechanisms , together with multi - nucleon interactions , when solving the frg equations .",
    "the following is a list of key results :    * the behaviour of the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition has been studied in detail , including the systematic evolution of the phase diagram from symmetric to asymmetric nuclear matter and to neutron matter .",
    "the chnm model produces a nuclear phase diagram that is remarkably close to the one found in perturbative calculations of the free - energy density using in - medium chiral effective field theory ( cheft ) . * a test case for",
    "the role of pionic and nuclear particle - hole fluctuations is the density dependence of the pion mass .",
    "in symmetric nuclear matter , the shift of the pion mass through s - wave pion - nuclear interactions is dominated by a charge - exchange double - scattering process whereas the leading ( mean - field ) term is suppressed .",
    "the frg - driven chnm calculation shows a close correspondence with an advanced calculation based on chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) in reproducing the emprical mass shift deduced from pionic atom data . *",
    "a further point of interest is the behavior of the chiral condensate , or equivalently , the expectation value of the @xmath98 field ( the in - medium pion decay constant ) as a function of baryon density or chemical potential .",
    "chiral models treated in mean - field approximation often display a first - order chiral phase transition not too far from the density of equilibrium nuclear matter .",
    "fluctuations shift this transition upward to very high densities . for symmetric nuclear matter up to about three times the equilibrium density ,",
    "the results of the non - perturbative frg approach are to in - medium chpt : fluctuations involving pauli principle effects and many - body forces stabilize the chiral order parameter against restoration of chiral symmetry at too low densities .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced in compressed neutron matter .",
    "whereas a mean - field calculation would suggest the appearance of a first - order chiral phase transition at about @xmath683 , the full frg treatment , with inclusion of fluctuations , stabilizes the nambu - goldstone phase of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry up to densities exceeding @xmath646 , indicating that hadronic degrees of freedom may persist even in the deep interior of neutron stars .",
    "altogether , the present study underlines the crucial importance of respecting well - established nuclear physics constraints in the investigation of the qcd phase diagram in regions of compressed baryonic matter .",
    "here we briefly examine different methods for solving wetterich s equation numerically .",
    "we focus on the leading order in the derivative expansion in the local potential approximation . even in this case , infinitely many operators are allowed in principle and therefore an infinite system of coupled differential equations would have to be solved .",
    "a truncation is necessary .",
    "one possible truncation is to perform a taylor expansion of the potential up to a certain order around the renormalization - scale dependent minimum .",
    "consider as a generic example the @xmath371 model from eq .",
    "( with @xmath376 and @xmath377 ) .",
    "the ansatz for the effective potential is @xmath684 with @xmath685 @xmath686 the @xmath371-invariant square of the fields @xmath372 and @xmath687 its value at the @xmath333-dependent minimum of the potential .",
    "the right - hand side of the flow equation   can also be expanded in a power series around @xmath687 .",
    "comparing the coefficients of both sides leads to flow equations for the couplings @xmath688 and for @xmath687 .",
    "the convergence of this expansion can be checked by going to higher orders , i.e. , by increasing @xmath689 .",
    "the taylor - expansion method is numerically fast .",
    "however , this method relies on the existence of a unique minimum .",
    "it breaks down at a first - order phase transition , such as the liquid - gas transition in nuclear matter .",
    "an alternative approach that also works for first - order transitions is the _ grid method _ @xcite .",
    "this method has been used for producing the results reported in section [ sec : nuclfrg ] . on the @xmath561-axis , a set of @xmath690 grid points , @xmath691 ,",
    "is chosen .",
    "the grid points are distributed with constant spacing , @xmath692 . around each of these grid points ,",
    "a local effective potential @xmath693 is defined on the interval @xmath694 .",
    "each potential is expanded up to the third power in @xmath561 ( i.e. , sixth powers in the fields ) around its respective grid point , @xmath695 the full effective potential @xmath696 is then obtained by gluing together these piecewise defined potentials . the flow equations for @xmath697",
    "are given by wetterich s equation evaluated at @xmath691 .",
    "wetterich s equation involves the second derivative of the potential with respect to the fields , so the flow equation will be a function @xmath698 that involves first and second @xmath561-derivatives of the potential . the flow equation for @xmath699",
    "is obtained by differentiating the flow equation for @xmath697 with respect to @xmath561 .",
    "the emerging system of differential equations is @xmath700 and so forth .",
    "this is so far a system of @xmath701 uncoupled differential equations , because the equation at grid point @xmath308 contains no information about the neighboring grid points .",
    "however , there are @xmath702 unknowns and the system is underdetermined .",
    "additional constraints are introduced by matching the potentials at different grid points .",
    "the continuity condition for the grand canonical potential and its derivative imply that the potential @xmath696 and its derivative @xmath703 must be continuous as well , following the gibbs - duhem relation .",
    "therefore the functions @xmath704 and @xmath705 must be matched between any two grid points . in total , there are @xmath706 matching conditions . in order to get a closed system of equations , two more equations are needed .",
    "these additional constraints are provided by matching the second derivative @xmath707 for the outmost grid points , between @xmath708 and @xmath709 and between @xmath710 and @xmath711 . in total , the complete matching conditions are : @xmath712 the set of constraint equations can be written as a system of linear equations , @xmath713 where @xmath714 and @xmath715 are @xmath716-matrices .",
    "the matrices @xmath714 and @xmath715 are complicated for larger values of @xmath717 and we do not write them down explicitly . however , the matrix @xmath715 can easily be inverted using computer algebra .",
    "the second and third derivatives of the potential , @xmath718 and @xmath719 , can then be expressed as functions of zeroth and first derivatives , @xmath720 and @xmath721 , respectively .",
    "we call these functions @xmath722 and @xmath723 for each @xmath724 : @xmath725 the functions @xmath722 and @xmath723 depend only linearly on their arguments .",
    "the coefficients take their maximal values at grid points @xmath726 and adjacent points , whereas the influence of more distant grid points decreases drastically .",
    "the @xmath701 functions @xmath722 and @xmath723 allow us to eliminate @xmath727 and @xmath728 from the flow equations  .",
    "the resulting set of coupled differential equations for @xmath697 and @xmath699 can be solved using efficient numerical routines such as runge - kutta algorithms . as an initial condition one must provide the potential and its first derivative at the uv scale , i.e. , @xmath729 , for @xmath730 and @xmath731 .",
    "the equations are to be integrated from @xmath341 down to @xmath560 . in practice",
    "it is not possible to integrate exactly down to @xmath560 because of numerical instabilities .",
    "an infrared cutoff @xmath732 needs to be introduced . if @xmath732 is chosen sufficiently small , the location of the minimum does not change any more and the physical predictions are left unaltered .",
    "the grid method has the advantage that it determines the potential not only around its minimum as in the taylor - expansion method , but globally as a function of @xmath561 . as a downside",
    "the numerical evaluation is considerably more costly compared to the taylor - expansion approach .",
