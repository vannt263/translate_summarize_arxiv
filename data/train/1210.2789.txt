    "recently , the bottomonium ground state @xmath3 was discovered in the processes @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "more data are expected to be accumulated in the forthcoming superb and lhc - b .",
    "therefore , investigation of the spectroscopy and decay processes related to this state becomes rather instructive .",
    "since it is still difficult to study strong interaction phenomena at non - perturbative regime , the study of quarkonium decay is generally performed in the framework of effective lagrangian with meson exchange .",
    "thus , the reliable determination of various characteristics , such as form factors and coupling constants are needed . in the decay process @xmath5 ,",
    "rescattering effects are important for understanding the anomalous largeness of the branching ratios  @xcite .",
    "as suggested in their work , this decay proceeds in two steps .",
    "first the @xmath6 decays into a @xmath7 intermediate state , and then these two particles produce the final states @xmath3 and @xmath8 by exchanging a @xmath1 meson . in order to compute the effect of these interactions in the final decay rate , the coupling constant of the @xmath0 vertex is an necessary input parameter . to describe strong interactions of @xmath0 at the hadronic level , the following effective lagrangian is employed  @xcite : @xmath9 the @xmath0 interactions are characterized by strong coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "however , such low - energy hadron interaction lie in a region which is very far away from the perturbative regime , precluding us to use the perturbative approach with the fundamental qcd lagrangian .",
    "therefore , we need some non - perturbative approaches , such as qcd sum rules @xcite , to calculate the form factors .    in this article",
    ", we calculate the form factor @xmath11 in the framework of three - point qcd sum rules ( qcdsr ) .",
    "more specifically , we evaluate two form factors : one when @xmath1 is the off - shell particle and another when @xmath2 is off - shell .",
    "the two results are parametrized by analytical forms and then extrapolated to obtain the coupling constant @xmath10 .",
    "herein , we use the same technique for the study of the couplings in the vertices @xmath12  @xcite , @xmath13  @xcite , @xmath14  @xcite , @xmath15  @xcite , @xmath16  @xcite , @xmath17  @xcite , @xmath18  @xcite and @xmath19  @xcite .",

    "the correlation function for an off - shell @xmath2 meson is @xmath24 and @xmath25 is transferred momentum .",
    "the general expression for the vertices ( [ correboff ] ) and ( [ correroff ] ) can be written in terms of the invariant amplitudes associated with two independent lorentz structures : @xmath26    in compliance with the qcdsr , the above correlation functions need to be calculated in two different ways : in the theoretical side , they are evaluated by the help of the operator product expansion ( ope ) , where the short and large distance effects are separated ; in the phenomenological side , they are calculated in terms of hadronic parameters such as masses , leptonic decay constants and form factors .",
    "the sum rules for the form factors are obtained with both representations being matched , invoking the quark - hadron duality and equating the coefficient of a sufficient structure from both sides of the correlation functions . to improve the matching between the two representations , double borel transformation with respect to the variables , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
