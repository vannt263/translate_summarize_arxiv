    "the angular momentum distribution of matter in haloes and galaxies plays an important role in their formation ( see * ? ? ?",

    "especially , the distribution of angular momenta inside a halo is directly related to the density profile of the galactic disc ( see  11.4 of * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "dark matter haloes in equilibrium are expected to share some universal properties .",
    "for example , it was shown in cosmological n - body simulations that virialized haloes follow a universal density profile @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the radial distance from center , which can be fitted as a simple function with two free parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( the nfw profile , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a natural and interesting question is whether haloes angular momenta follow any universal profile .",
    "we will address this question in this article .",

    "@xcite present a universal _ mass profile _ that is related to the angular momenta of galactic haloes , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass with specific angular momenta smaller than @xmath20 , @xmath5 is the halo virial mass , @xmath21 is the maximum specific angular momentum inside the halo , and @xmath22 is a free parameter ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for further discussions .",
    "the differential and cumulative specific angular momentum profiles mentioned above were obtained assuming spherical symmetry .",
    "however , the angular momentum of a halo defines a special direction , and deviations from spherical symmetry should be taken into account . @xcite",
    "discuss the cylindrically symmetric spatial profile of angular momenta for individual haloes , and notice that haloes tend to have larger @xmath20 in the equatorial plane and smaller @xmath20 along the polar direction .",
    "however , the noises in their profiles of individual haloes , which are caused by substructures and complicated formation histories , are fairly large .    in this article , we reduce such noises by stacking high - resolution haloes with similar masses .",
    "the stacking method significantly increases the signal - to - noise ratio and is widely used in astronomical image processing and studying haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the mass and force resolutions are @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xmath30 respectively .",
    "a detailed description of the simulation can be found in @xcite .",
    "we use distinct haloes with masses @xmath31\\times 10^{12}h^{-1}m_\\odot$ ] in the bolshoi bdmv halo catalogue , which are identified using the bound density maximum method ( bdm , * ? ? ?",

    "here @xmath33 is the background matter density .",
    "this definition is equivalent to an overdensity parameter @xmath34 with respect to the critical density @xmath35 .",
    "note that the bolshoi database does not provide lists of particles for haloes , and we have to query particles directly from simulation snapshots . from each halo centre",
    ", we select all particles inside the halo virial radius @xmath36 and regard them as primary halo particles . then the unbound particles in the primary set",
    "are removed using an iteration method ( see appendix [ appendix_unbound ] for details ) .",
    "the remaining particles are processed to study the angular momentum profile .",
    "we only consider haloes at @xmath37 ( snapshot 416 in the bolshoi simulation ) in this article .",
    "there are totally 13606 haloes in our sample .",
    "the smallest halo in the sample contains @xmath38 particles , which has high enough resolution for us to probe the angular momentum profile .",
    "the haloes are divided into 6 mass bins for stacking .",
    "the details are summarised in the first three columns of table [ bolshoi_amp ] .",
    "we define the direction of the specific angular momentum of a halo , @xmath39 , as the @xmath40axis and assume that the spatial distribution of @xmath20 is cylindrically symmetric around it , where @xmath20 is the @xmath40component of the specific angular momentum @xmath41 at different locations .",
    "under such an assumption , the specific angular momentum profile does not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath42 , and it is a function of @xmath43 and @xmath44 only , @xmath44 being the zenith angle .",

    "to calculate @xmath0 for a halo , we divide @xmath46 and @xmath44 into several bins requiring that in each bin , the number of particles reaches a threshold of @xmath47 .",

    "we use the same spatial bin dividing scheme for @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    ". then we stack @xmath59 from different haloes in the same mass bin to obtain an average profile , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of haloes in the mass bin .",
    "to estimate the errors of @xmath62 in the @xmath63-th spatial bin , @xmath64 , we use @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the statistical and systematic errors respectively .",
    "the statistical error accounts for the dispersion of the stacking sample , and is computed as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the standard deviation of @xmath50 .",
    "the systematic error , @xmath67 , originates from the numerical discreteness of particles in each spatial bin . to estimate @xmath67 , we pick the most massive halo from our catalogue , and randomly select a fraction of particles from it to create a low - resolution counterpart . by generating @xmath70 such low - resolution realizations",
    ", we can compute the mean @xmath71 and standard deviation @xmath72 in each spatial bin .",
    "we find that @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the particle number in the spatial bin . here , the physical unit of @xmath71 is @xmath26 @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "it implies that a spatial bin with a larger particle number and specific angular momentum tends to estimate @xmath77 more precisely , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "this is quite similar to the error estimation proposed by @xcite based on physical arguments ( see their eq .",
    "4 ) . in this article",
    ", we adopt @xmath79 .",
    "the profile is fitted using non - linear least squares by minimizing the residuals with the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite : @xmath80 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{\\bar{j},i}^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the total number of spatial bins in @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and @xmath82 is the model profile .",
    "the fitting method we used assumes the distribution of @xmath50 in each mass bin to be gaussian .",
    "this can be verified from the data , as shown in figure [ bin_gaussian ] .",
    "the angular momentum of each spatial bin is a consequence of a series of complicated `` random '' processes ( e.g. tidal torquing , collapsing , merging , etc . ) , and @xmath83 approximate to a normal distribution according to the central limit theorem .     for the spatial bin of @xmath84",

    "we use the jackknife resampling to estimate the standard errors of the fitted parameters . for a mass bin with @xmath61 haloes , we create @xmath61 resamples by leaving out one halo each time . for each resample with @xmath87 haloes , we perform a non - linear least square fit outlined above to the stacked profile .",
    "finally , the standard errors are computed from the @xmath61 estimations of the fitted parameters .",

    "the parameter @xmath4 scales with the halo mass as @xmath95 which is consistent with the angular momentum - mass relation for virialized dark matter haloes , @xmath96 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there is a weak trend for @xmath7 to increase for more massive haloes .",
    "the @xmath97 relation can be approximately described by @xmath98 . for @xmath3",
    ", there is no obvious trends for it to depend on halo masses .",
    "it fluctuates around a mean value of @xmath99 , and agrees with this mean value in @xmath100 level .",
    "it is possible to eliminate the mass dependence of @xmath4 by introducing @xmath101 , and rewriting equation ( [ eq_fitted_amp ] ) as @xmath102 in this case , all of the three parameters , @xmath103 , @xmath7 and @xmath3 , can be approximately regarded as universal for haloes with different masses .",
    "this is useful for roughly modelling the angular momentum distribution in a halo .",
    "but in the following discussions , we still use the model of equation ( [ eq_fitted_amp ] ) .",
    "the fitted profile tells us that the outer parts close to the equatorial plane of a halo tend to have larger specific angular momentum , while the inner parts near the polar direction usually have smaller @xmath20 .",
    "our results confirm the conclusion from 4 haloes in @xcite .",
    "similar to the scale radius in the nfw density profile , the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath3 in @xmath0 measure the `` concentration '' of the specific angular momentum along @xmath104 and @xmath105 directions .",
    "the smaller @xmath7 @xmath106 is , the more @xmath20 concentrates to the halo centre ( @xmath40axis ) along the radial ( @xmath107 ) direction .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 measures the magnitude of @xmath20 , which strongly correlates with the halo mass .",
    "the universal specific angular momentum profile for simulated haloes is clearly different from that of a rigid body ( rb ) . rotating with a constant angular velocity @xmath108 , a rigid body , which was usually adopted in early disk galaxy formation models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
