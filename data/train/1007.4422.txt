    "with the experimental realizations of atomic bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) , molecular bec and fermionic condensate , considerable attention has been given to degenerate boson - fermion mixtures ( dbfms ) where particles obeying different quantum statistics are intermingled @xcite .",
    "the dbfms , such as @xmath0li-@xmath1li @xcite , @xmath2na-@xmath1li @xcite , @xmath3rb-@xmath4k modugno , roati , goldwin , ospelkaus , best , and @xmath5yb-@xmath6yb fukuhara , have been successfully observed by different experimental groups via interspecies sympathetic cooling .",
    "in addition , such mixtures can also be realized from an imbalanced two - component fermi gas where all minority fermions pair up with majority fermions and form a bec partridge , zwierlein .",
    "the collisional interactions between bosons and fermions strongly affect the properties of dbfms , even though the ultracold mixed gases are very dilute molmer , roth1,adhikari1,akdeniz , minguzzi , capuzzi , nygaard , viverit , roth2,jezek , adhikari2,ma , hu , santhanam , salasnich1,fang , maruyama , marchetti .",
    "a noticeable example is the structure and stability of a trapped dbfm which has been investigated extensively by several authors . in the case of repulsive boson - fermion ( bf ) interaction ,",
    "the system is expected to undergo a mixing - demixing transition with the increase of the repulsion , while in the case of attractive bf interaction the mixture collapses above a critical strength modugno , ospelkaus , molmer , roth1,adhikari1,akdeniz , minguzzi , capuzzi , modugnom , chui , takeuchi , linder . in particular , the effect of a bosonic vortex on the stability and the mixing - demixing transition of a dbfm is recently addressed jezek , adhikari3 .",
    "it is shown that when the bec sustains a vortex state the dbfm becomes more stable .    in this paper",

    "the theoretical predictions on fermionic collapse in a dbfm agree well with the experimental results @xcite , and those on bright solitons are in agreement with a relevant microscopic investigation @xcite .",
    "we show that , for interspecies repulsion , the bosonic component may form a petal - shaped coreinside the honeycomb - like fermionic one , or a ring - shaped joint shell  around the onion - like fermionic cloud , or even segregated islandsembedded in the disc - shaped fermi gas . for interspecies attraction below the critical value for collapse , there is an enhanced mixing ( even an almost complete mixing ) between bosons and fermions , where the fermionic cloud tends to simulate a bosonic vavss .",

    "furthermore , the dbfm with a bosonic vavss ( @xmath95 ) is more stable than the conventional one without vortex ( @xmath171 ) in the wide range of @xmath172 because for the bosonic vavss there is an additional repulsive centrifugal term @xmath173 in the stationary gp equation @xcite . when @xmath174 all the four different cases of dbfm become instable for @xmath7 above the order of unit . for the dbfms with a bosonic vortex ( vavss ) of higher @xmath73",

    "we have investigated the structure and stability of a quasi-2d dbfm with a bosonic vavss , where the bb interaction is taken to be repulsive and the bf interaction to be both repulsive and attractive .",
    "it is shown that the bosonic and fermionic density distributions for a dbfm with a bosonic vavss in a harmonic plus quartic potential are more tightly confined than those in a harmonic potential .",
    "the additional quartic distortion due to experimental uncertainties or artificial quartic confinement does not influence the stationary structure of the mixture , and may favor the sympathetic cooling between the interspecies and makes the system more stable .    depending on the choice of parameters ,",
    "the dbfm with a bosonic vavss can show rich phase structures . for repulsive bf interaction , the bosonic component can form a petal - shaped coreinside the honeycomb - like fermionic one , or a ring - shaped joint shell  around the onion - like fermionic cloud , or multiple segregated islandsembedded in the disc - shaped fermi gas .",
    "note that the different separated phases in the dbfm with a bosonic vavss are formed under different parameter conditions and can not be achieved by just changing the bf coupling continuously , which is different from the case of a conventional dbfm molmer .",
    "in addition , there is a mixing - demixing transition which is controlled by the strength of the bf repulsion . for attractive bf interaction below the threshold for collapse , an almost complete mixing between the bosonic and fermionic components",
    "can be formed , where the fermionic component tends to simulate a bosonic vavss .",
    "furthermore , we give the stability region for four different cases of dbfm with specific parameters , where the two stability curves of the dbfm with a bosonic vavss and the one with a bosonic vortex display an intermittent configuration .",
    "these new findings can be verified in the future experiments on dbfms , and thus the present work provides a new way to test further the validity and prediction of the quantum - hydrodynamic model .",
