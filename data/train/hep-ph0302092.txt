    "@xmath0 violating interactions of the heavy majorana neutrinos can give rise to a lepton asymmetry and , via the @xmath9 and @xmath10 sphaleron processes , to a related baryon asymmetry .",
    "this is the simple and elegant leptogenesis mechanism @xcite .",
    "leptogenesis is a non - equilibrium process which takes place at temperatures @xmath20 . for a decay width small compared to the hubble parameter ,",

    "this is equivalent to the condition that the effective neutrino mass @xmath23 equals the ` equilibrium neutrino mass ' @xmath24 where we have used @xmath25  gev and @xmath26 as effective number of degrees of freedom . for @xmath27 ( @xmath28 )",
    "the heavy neutrinos of type @xmath29 are in ( out of ) thermal equilibrium at @xmath30 .",
    "it is very remarkable that the equilibrium neutrino mass @xmath31 is close to the neutrino masses suggested by neutrino oscillations , @xmath4  ev and @xmath5  ev .",
    "this suggests that it may be possible to understand the cosmological baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis as a process close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "ideally , @xmath32 and @xmath33 processes would be strong enough at temperatures above @xmath34 to keep the heavy neutrinos in thermal equilibrium and weak enough to allow the generation of an asymmetry at temperatures below @xmath34 .",
    "an analysis of solutions of the boltzmann equations shows that this is indeed the case if light and heavy neutrino masses lie in an appropriate mass range .",
    "in general , the final baryon asymmetry is the result of a competition between production processes and washout processes which tend to erase any generated asymmetry . unless the heavy majorana neutrinos are partially degenerate , @xmath35 , the dominant processes are decays and inverse decays of @xmath29 and the usual off - shell @xmath32 and @xmath33 scatterings .",
    "the final baryon asymmetry then depends on just four parameters @xcite : the mass @xmath34 of @xmath29 , the @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath36 in @xmath29 decays , the effective neutrino mass @xmath2 and , finally , the sum of all neutrino masses squared , @xmath37 , which controls an important class of washout processes .",

    "we extend the previous analysis in two directions .",
    "we derive an improved upper bound on the @xmath0 asymmetry which leads to a more stringent upper bound on light neutrino masses .",
    "in addition , we study in detail the washout of a pre - existing @xmath12 asymmetry , which yields a lower bound on the effective neutrino mass @xmath2 . in this way",
    "we obtain a window of neutrino masses for which leptogenesis can explain the observed cosmological baryon asymmetry , independent of initial conditions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we derive an improved upper bound on the @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath36 and illustrate how it can be saturated for specific neutrino mass matrices .",
    "theoretical expectations for the range of neutrino masses are discussed in section  3 . in section",
    "4 we then derive upper bounds on the light neutrino masses in the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy , and we discuss the stability of these bounds . section  5 deals with the washout of a large initial @xmath12 asymmetry , and a summary of our results is given in section  6 .",
    "given the masses of heavy and light majorana neutrinos the @xmath0 asymmetry @xmath36 in the decays of @xmath29 , the lightest of the heavy neutrinos , satisfies an upper bound @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall study under which conditions this upper bound is saturated and how it depends on the effective neutrino mass @xmath2 which plays an important role in the thermodynamic process of leptogenesis .    the standard model with right - handed neutrinos",
    "is described by the lagrangian , @xmath41 where @xmath15 is the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos , and the yukawa couplings @xmath42 yield the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath43 after spontaneous symmetry breaking , @xmath44 .",
    "we work in the mass eigenstate basis of the right - handed neutrinos where @xmath15 is diagonal with real and positive eigenvalues @xmath45 . the seesaw mechanism @xcite then yields the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath46 which can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix @xmath47 , @xmath48 with real and positive eigenvalues satisfying @xmath49 .",
    "it is convenient to work in a basis where also the light neutrino mass matrix is diagonal . in this basis",
    "the yukawa couplings are @xmath50 as a consequence of the seesaw formula the matrix @xmath51 , @xmath52 is orthogonal , @xmath53 @xcite .",

    "consider the normalized yukawa couplings @xmath60 with @xmath61 the orthogonality condition @xmath62 yields the additional constraint @xmath63 in the new variables the @xmath0 asymmetry reads @xmath64 since @xmath65 , one also has @xmath66 .",

    "these conditions are satisfied for maximal @xmath67 , if @xmath76 and @xmath77 @xmath78 note that in the limit @xmath72 , @xmath29 couples only to @xmath79 . for @xmath80",

    "( [ iemax ] ) the only model independent restriction on the effective neutrino mass is @xmath108 .",
    "the improved upper bound on the @xmath0 asymmetry implies also a bound on the light neutrino masses which is more stringent than the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "this will be discussed in section  4 .",
    "at present we know two mass squared differences for the light neutrinos , which are deduced from the measurements of solar and atmospheric neutrino fluxes .",
    "in addition we have information about elements of the mixing matrix @xmath109 in the leptonic charged current . since @xmath109 could be entirely due to mixings of the charged leptons , this does not constrain the light neutrino mass matrix in a model independent way .",
    "the light neutrino masses @xmath110 can be either quasi - degenerate or hierarchical , with @xmath111 ( ` normal hierarchy ' ) or @xmath112 ( ` inverted hierarchy ' ) .",
    "the best information on the absolute neutrino mass scale comes from neutrinoless double @xmath113-decay , which yields an upper bound on the light majorana neutrino masses of about 1  ev @xcite .",
    "a crucial quantity for thermal leptogenesis is the effective neutrino mass @xmath2 which is always larger than @xmath101 @xcite , as one easily sees from the orthogonality of @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "( [ ortho ] ) ) , @xmath114 as we saw in the previous section , the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry is reached for @xmath115 , such that @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "there is no model independent upper bound on @xmath2 .",
    "however , if there are no strong cancelations due to phase relations between different matrix elements , one has @xmath118 hence , the natural range for the effective neutrino mass is @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , we are not aware of any neutrino mass model where this is not the case .",
    "it is instructive to examine the range of @xmath2 also in the special case @xmath120 . as we saw in the previous section this case",
    "is realized for @xmath121 , corresponding to @xmath122 .",
    "the orthogonality condition then implies @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "hence , for maximal @xmath0 asymmetry one has @xmath125 showing that the value of @xmath126 is tuned by just one quantity .",
    "for @xmath127 , one has @xmath107 , while the case @xmath128 corresponds to a fine tuned situation in which @xmath129 .",
    "if the observed large mixing angles in the leptonic charged current originate from the neutrino mass matrix , which appears natural since their majorana nature distinguishes neutrinos from quarks , the masses @xmath101 and @xmath2 are related to @xmath58 and @xmath102 .",
    "the seesaw mechanism together with leptogenesis then also constrains the heavy majorana neutrino masses .",
    "large mixing angles are naturally explained if neutrino masses are quasi - degenerate @xcite .",
    "one then has @xmath130  ev .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite and further strengthened in the following section , quasi - degenerate neutrinos are strongly disfavored by thermal leptogenesis .",
    "a possible exception is the case where also the heavy majorana neutrinos are partially degenerate .",
    "one then gets an enhancement of the @xmath0 asymmetry which allows one to increase the neutrino masses and still have successful leptogenesis .",
    "models with @xmath131 and @xmath132 have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "note , however , that in these examples the light neutrino masses are not quasi - degenerate .",
    "we shall pursue this case further in section  4.3 .",
    "the neutrino mass pattern with inverted hierarchy has also received much attention in the literature .",
    "there is , however , the well known difficulty of this scenario to fit the large angle msw solution @xcite .",
    "we also do not know any model with inverted hierarchy which incorporates successfully leptogenesis , and we shall therefore not pursue this case further .",
    "we are then left with the case of neutrino masses with normal hierarchy .",
    "there are many neutrino mass models of this type with successful leptogenesis .",
    "the mass hierarchy is usually controlled by a parameter @xmath133 . for the effective neutrino mass one can then have , for instance , @xmath134 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . a simple and attractive form of the light neutrino mass matrix , which can account for all data , is given by @xcite , @xmath135 where coefficients @xmath136 have been omitted .",
    "this form could follow from a u(1 ) family symmetry @xcite or a relation between the hierarchies of dirac and majorana neutrino masses @xcite . in the second case one",
    "has @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which is compatible with leptogenesis .",
    "the structure of the mass matrix ( [ mnu ] ) as well as predictions for the coefficients @xmath136 can be obtained in seesaw models where the exchange of two heavy majorana neutrinos dominates @xcite . in all these examples",
    "the range of the effective neutrino mass is @xmath139 .",
    "thermal leptogenesis also leads to a lower bound on @xmath34 , the smallest of the heavy neutrino masses @xcite . in the minimal scenario , where the heavy neutrinos are not degenerate ,",
    "one obtains the lower bound @xmath94  gev @xcite .",
    "it is reached for maximal @xmath0 asymmetry ( @xmath104 ) , minimal washout ( @xmath93 ) , and assuming thermal initial @xmath29 abundance .",
    "the bound becomes more stringent for restricted patterns of mass matrices @xcite .",
    "it can be relaxed if the heavy neutrinos are partially degenerate @xcite .",
    "it is useful to recast the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry ( [ iemax ] ) in the following way , @xmath140 where @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 the maximal value , @xmath144 , is obtained for @xmath104 .",
    "note , that @xmath145 for the best fit values extracted from the kamland data @xcite , @xmath146 , and the superkamiokande data @xcite , @xmath147 .",
    "we will calculate particle numbers and asymmetries normalized to the number of photons per comoving volume before the onset of leptogenesis at @xmath148 @xcite . for zero initial @xmath12 asymmetry , i.e. @xmath149",
    ", the final @xmath12 asymmetry produced by leptogenesis is given by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the ` efficiency factor ' .",
    "in the minimal version of thermal leptogenesis one considers initial temperatures @xmath152 , where @xmath34 is the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino @xmath29 . in this case @xmath153 , and the maximal value , @xmath154 , is obtained for thermal initial @xmath29 abundance in the limit @xmath155 .",
    "the heavy neutrinos @xmath29 then decay fully out of equilibrium at temperatures well below @xmath34 , producing a @xmath12 asymmetry which survives until today since all washout processes are frozen at temperatures @xmath156 .",
    "in the case of general initial conditions and arbitrary values of @xmath2 , the efficiency factor @xmath151 has to be calculated by solving the boltzmann equations @xcite , @xmath157 where @xmath158 .",
    "there are four classes of processes which contribute to the different terms in the equations : decays , inverse decays , @xmath32 scatterings and processes mediated by heavy neutrinos .",
    "the first three all modify the @xmath29 abundance . denoting by @xmath159 the hubble parameter , @xmath160 accounts for decays and inverse decays , while @xmath161 represents the @xmath32 scatterings .",
    "the decays are also the source term for the generation of the @xmath12 asymmetry , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ lg2 ] ) , while all the other processes contribute to the total washout term @xmath162 which competes with the decay source term .",
    "we take into account only decays of @xmath29 , neglecting the decays of the heavier neutrinos @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "these decays produce a @xmath12 asymmetry at temperatures higher than @xmath34 .",
    "as we shall see in section  5 , the washout processes at @xmath165 very efficiently erase any previously generated asymmetry . even in the case of very small mass differences",
    "the decays of @xmath163 and @xmath164 do not change significantly the bound on the light neutrino masses , which is our main interest .",
    "this will be discussed in section  4.3 .",
    "the baryon to photon number ratio at recombination , @xmath166 , is simply related to @xmath167 by @xmath168 , where @xmath169 @xcite is the fraction of @xmath12 asymmetry which is converted into a baryon asymmetry by sphaleron processes , and @xmath170 accounts for the dilution of the asymmetry due to standard photon production from the onset of leptogenesis till recombination .",
    "@xmath171 , the final baryon asymmetry produced by leptogenesis with maximal @xmath0 asymmetry , i.e. @xmath172 ) , is given by @xmath173 this quantity has to be compared with measurements of the cmb experiments boomerang @xcite and dasi @xcite , @xmath174 the cmb constraint then requires @xmath175 , and we will adopt for @xmath176 the @xmath177 lower limit , @xmath178 .    in @xcite we showed that @xmath179 depends just on the three parameters @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath181 , the cmb constraint determines an allowed region in the @xmath182-plane .",
    "it was also shown that there is an upper bound for @xmath181 above which no allowed region exists . in @xcite ,",
    "based on the bound ( [ emax ] ) for the @xmath0 asymmetry , @xmath183 was derived as upper bound on the neutrino mass scale . in the following",
    "we shall study the allowed regions in the @xmath182-plane for different parameters @xmath181 using the improved bound on the @xmath0 asymmetry ( [ iemax ] ) and in this way determine a new improved bound on @xmath181 .",
    "the neutrino masses @xmath101 and @xmath102 depend in a different way on @xmath181 in the cases of normal and inverted hierarchy , respectively .",
    "hence , also the dependence of the function @xmath113 on @xmath181 is different for these two mass patterns .",
    "this leads to different maximal baryon asymmetries @xmath179 , and therefore to different upper bounds on @xmath181 , in the two cases which we now study in turn .    for neutrino masses with normal hierarchy one",
    "has @xmath184 and the dependence on @xmath181 is given by @xmath185 these relations are plotted in fig .  1 .",
    "note that there is a minimal value of @xmath181 , corresponding to @xmath104 , which is given by @xmath186 .",
    "2 shows the lines of constant maximal baryon asymmetry @xmath187 ( thick lines ) and @xmath188 ( thin lines ) in the @xmath189-plane for different choices of @xmath181 and assuming zero initial @xmath29 abundance .",
    "the allowed regions ( the filled ones ) correspond to the constraint @xmath190 .",
    "the largest allowed region is obtained for @xmath191 , since in this case the @xmath0 asymmetry is maximal , i.e. @xmath144 for any value of @xmath2 , and the washout is minimal .",
    "note that a different choice for the initial @xmath29 abundance would have affected the final baryon asymmetry only for @xmath28 .",
    "the case of an initial thermal abundance has been studied in @xcite .",
    "when @xmath181 increases different effects combine to shrink the allowed region until it completely disappears at some value @xmath192 .",
    "we have determined this value with a numerical uncertainly of @xmath193 . from fig .  2",
    "one can see that there is a small allowed region for @xmath194 , whereas we found no allowed region for @xmath195 .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath192 is somewhere in between and we can conclude that in the case of normal hierarchy , @xmath196 using the relations ( [ numanor1])-([numanor3 ] ) , one can easily translate this bound into upper limits on the individual neutrino masses ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 )",
    ", @xmath197    the case of an inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses corresponds to @xmath198 and the relations between the neutrino masses and @xmath181 are @xmath199 we have plotted these relations in fig .",
    "the minimal value of @xmath181 , corresponding to @xmath104 , is now @xmath200 .",
    "the curves of constant @xmath179 are shown in fig .  4 for different values of @xmath181 .",
    "the largest allowed region is again obtained for @xmath191 .",
    "one can see that this time there is a tiny allowed region for @xmath195 and no allowed region for @xmath201 .",
    "therefore , in the case of inverted hierarchy the upper bound is slightly relaxed , @xmath202 using the relations ( [ numainv1])-([numainv3 ] ) one can again translate the bound on @xmath181 into bounds on the individual neutrino masses , @xmath203    let us now discuss the different effects which combine to shrink the allowed region when the absolute neutrino mass scale @xmath181 increases , thus yielding the upper bound .",
    "the first effect is that away from the hierarchical neutrino case , for @xmath204 and @xmath205 , the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry reduces considerably .",
    "this can be seen in terms of the function @xmath113 ( cf .",
    "( [ beta ] ) ) which is conveniently expressed in the form @xmath206 the first factor , @xmath207 , is the maximal value of @xmath113 for fixed @xmath181 ; @xmath208 decreases @xmath209 for @xmath210 ( cf .",
    "fig .  5 ) .",
    "this implies that for increasing @xmath181 there is an overall suppression of the maximal baryon asymmetry in the whole @xmath182-plane @xcite .",
    "in particular the lower limit on @xmath34 becomes more stringent .",
    "the factor @xmath211 , for any value of @xmath2 , if @xmath191 ( @xmath104 ) . in the case",
    "@xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) it vanishes for @xmath212 and grows monotonically to @xmath213 with increasing @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "fig .  6 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath214 the function @xmath215 gives a further suppression of the @xmath0 asymmetry , in addition to the one from @xmath216 .",
    "this suppression is strong for @xmath217 and disappears for @xmath218 .",
    "hence the decrease of the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry for @xmath204 shrinks the allowed region most at small @xmath217 and at small @xmath34 .",
    "note that the difference between the allowed regions for normal and inverted hierarchy is accounted for by the different values of @xmath113 for a given value of @xmath181 . in the case of inverted hierarchy",
    "@xmath113 is larger for any value of @xmath2 and @xmath219 ( cf",
    ".  figs .",
    "the effect is maximal for @xmath220 where @xmath221 while @xmath222 . for larger values of @xmath223 , and also @xmath224 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath225 becomes very close to @xmath213 .",
    "this situation is realized when @xmath181 approaches its upper bound .",
    "this explains why the upper bound on @xmath181 is only slightly relaxed in the case of inverted hierarchy .",
    "the second effect , which shrinks the allowed region when @xmath181 increases , is the enhancement of washout processes . in @xcite",
    "we showed how the total washout rate can be written as the sum of two terms , @xmath226 and @xmath227 .",
    "the first term is responsible for the reduction of the allowed region at large @xmath2 .",
    "the second term leads to the boundary at large @xmath34 .",
    "the combined effect shrinks the allowed region with increasing @xmath181 at large @xmath34 and at large @xmath2 .",
    "one can see how this second effect reduces the allowed region , independent of the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry decrease , by comparing the two largest allowed regions for normal and inverted hierarchy ; they correspond to the two different values of @xmath228 ( cf .",
    "fig .  2 and fig .  4 ) .",
    "since @xmath144 in both cases , the entire difference is due to the different washout effects .",
    "they are larger in the case of inverted hierarchy because @xmath228 is about @xmath229 higher than in the normal hierarchy case .",
    "one can see how , for a fixed value of @xmath2 , the maximal value of @xmath34 is approximately halved in the inverted hierarchy case .",
    "correspondingly , the maximal allowed value of @xmath2 is lower for inverted hierarchy than for normal hierarchy .    in summary , within the theoretical uncertainties",
    ", leptogenesis can not distinguish between normal and inverted hierarchical neutrino mass patterns .",
    "however , our new analysis confirms and strengthens the results of @xcite that quasi - degenerate neutrino masses are strongly disfavored by leptogenesis , by putting the stringent upper bound of 0.12  ev on all neutrino masses .",
    "the numerical results can be very well reproduced analytically @xcite .",
    "this procedure is not only able to yield the correct value of @xmath192 but also reveals some general features which in the numerical analysis may appear accidental .    for @xmath230 , at the peak value of maximal asymmetry , such that @xmath231 , one has @xmath232 the value of @xmath192 is slightly different for normal and inverted hierarchy , respectively , @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the zero - th order approximation .",
    "this implies @xmath235    besides gaining more insight into the numerical results , the analytic procedure also allows to find the dependence of the bound on the involved physical parameters and to study in this way its stability .",
    "consider first the dependence on the experimental quantities @xmath176 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath236 , the dependence on @xmath39 is so small that it can be neglected , yielding @xmath237 .",
    "the analytic procedure shows that @xmath238 . from the numerical result , found for @xmath239 and @xmath240 , and",
    "one then obtains in general @xmath241    using eq .",
    "( [ gen ] ) one immediately gets the central value of @xmath192 . note also that for @xmath242 and @xmath145 , one has @xmath243 .",
    "this is confirmed by the numerical results .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath252 , which corresponds to the absolute error @xmath253 . in the coming years",
    "the errors on @xmath249 and @xmath254 will be greatly reduced by the satellite experiments map @xcite and planck @xcite , and by the long baseline experiments minos @xcite and cngs @xcite , respectively , and consequently the error on @xmath192 will be considerably reduced",
    ".    another important question concerns the enhancement of the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry when @xmath255 , where @xmath34 and @xmath256 are the masses of the heavy neutrinos @xmath29 and @xmath163 , becomes comparable to or smaller than @xmath34 itself . as long as the mass splitting is larger than the decay widths , the enhancement is given by @xcite , @xmath257\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath258 .",
    "note , that @xmath259 approaches 1 for @xmath260 .",
    "the value of @xmath192 increases like @xmath261 @xcite , and it is therefore easy to see how the bound on @xmath181 gets relaxed for small values of the mass difference @xmath262 .    in fig .",
    "7 we have plotted the enhancement @xmath263 and the central value of @xmath192 , together with its @xmath264 limits , as function of @xmath265 .    for @xmath266 the bounds ( [ boundn]),([boundi ] ) are recovered . only for values @xmath267 the bound",
    "gets relaxed in an appreciable way .",
    "an increase of @xmath192 by a factor @xmath268 , allowing quasi - degenerate neutrino masses of 0.4  ev , which could be detected with the katrin experiment @xcite , requires degeneracies @xmath269 .    in the regime",
    "@xmath270 also decays of @xmath163 have to be taken into account . as we shall see in the next section , for larger mass splittings",
    "an asymmetry generated in @xmath163 decays would be washed out before @xmath165 , and it is then sufficient to consider only @xmath29 decays .",
    "however , even for @xmath267 , it is easy to see that the effect of such an additional asymmetry on the bound is small compared to the effect of the @xmath0 asymmetry enhancement described above .",
    "the largest effect would be obtained for @xmath271 and @xmath272 , corresponding to a doubled heavy neutrino abundance without any washout enhancement . in this extreme case",
    "the bound is relaxed at most by a factor @xmath273 . even for three degenerate neutrinos , with both @xmath274 and @xmath275 ,",
    "the effect could relax the bound not more than by a factor @xmath276 .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 enhancement represents the dominant effect and we can conclude that the bound on @xmath181 can only be evaded in case of an extreme degeneracy among the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "a further important issue is the effect of supersymmetry on the bound . in this case",
    "the maximal @xmath0 asymmetry is about twice as large which could relax the bound by a factor @xmath277 .",
    "however , washout processes are also considerably enhanced @xcite .",
    "this effect goes into the opposite direction and is actually stronger , so that one can expect a slightly more stringent bound on @xmath181 .",
    "a detailed calculation will be presented in @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the leptogenesis upper bound on neutrino masses is very stable .",
    "the essential reason is that , at @xmath230 , the peak value @xmath278 .",
    "hence , any variation of the final asymmetry results into change of @xmath192 which is almost one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the same argument applies also to the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "although the various corrections to the boltzmann equations still remain to be calculated , we do not expect a relaxation of @xmath192 by more than @xmath279 .",
    "in fact , we expect that the corrections will go in the direction of lowering the prediction on the final asymmetry , which will make the bound on @xmath181 more stringent .    for particular patterns of neutrino mass matrices stronger bounds on the light neutrino masses can be obtained .",
    "for instance , one can study how the upper bound changes if @xmath34 is required to be smaller than some cut - off value @xmath280 . for @xmath281 ( cf .",
    "( [ m1max ] ) ) the bound does not change . for smaller values of @xmath34",
    "the bound becomes more stringent .",
    "for example , from figs .  2 and",
    "4 one can see that the cut - off @xmath282 leads to the bound @xmath283 , which corresponds to @xmath284 .",
    "for a restricted mass pattern , and neglecting @xmath285 washout terms , less stringent bounds have been found in @xcite for the same cut - off value of @xmath34 .",
    "a very important question for leptogenesis , and baryogenesis in general , is the dependence on initial conditions .",
    "this includes the dependence on the initial abundance of heavy majorana neutrinos , which has been studied in detail in @xcite , and also the effect of an initial asymmetry which may have been generated by some other mechanism . in the following",
    "we shall study the efficiency of the washout of a large initial asymmetry by heavy majorana neutrinos .    for simplicity , we neglect the small asymmetry generated through the @xmath0 violating interactions of the heavy neutrinos , i.e. we set @xmath286 . the kinetic equation ( [ lg2 ] ) for the asymmetry then becomes @xmath287 where @xmath288 is the number of lepton doublets per comoving volume . the final @xmath12 asymmetry is then given by @xmath289 with the washout factor @xmath290    in eq .",
