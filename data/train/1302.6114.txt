    ". as these configurations have the same magnetization component parallel to , they are indistinguishable for this particular field direction .",
    "the thermal conductivity , however , seems to be sensitive to the actually realized ground - state configuration .",
    "above , the spin ice is fully polarized , and the thermal conductivity does not depend on the actual field - sweep direction . when entering the kagom - ice phase from higher field , the spins of the triangular planes which separate the kagomplanes stay polarized , whereas the spins of the kagomplanes arrange in such a way that the tetrahedra obey the ice rule .",
    "as this configuration can easily be achieved by flipping only one spin per tetrahedron , it can be assumed that this configuration is close to thermal equilibrium . as a consequence , stays almost constant on the kagom - ice plateau .",
    "the situation is more complicated when approaching the kagom - ice phase from below , _ i.e._from the highly entropic ground state after zero - field cooling .",
    "the magnetic field initially polarizes the spins of the triangular planes . flipping such a spin",
    ", however , produces a monopole / anti - monopole pair in two neighboring kagomplanes . to reach thermal equilibrium ,",
    "these monopoles ( and anti - monopoles ) have to be annihilated .",
    "this out - of - equilibrium state results in a reduced , and time - dependent measurements of ( not shown ) reveal that it very slowly converges towards the larger equilibrium value . when approaching the transition at , the energy gap to the fully polarized state vanishes and , as a consequence , the kagomplanes can easily reach thermal equilibrium .",
    "this results in an increase of @xmath7 towards .",
    "an interesting finding is the fact that in the field - decreasing run , _ i.e._in ( or at least close to ) thermal equilibrium , remains constant on the kagom - ice plateau although the energy gap to the ( anti-)monopole excitations increases with decreasing field .    in sum , our data for the different magnetic - field directions reveal that there is a magnetic contribution , whose magnitude directly correlates with the degree of the ground - state degeneracy of the magnetic spin ice  @xcite .",
    "at least qualitatively , we have evidence that arises from the monopole excitations and that its magnitude mainly depends on the monopole mobility which is related to the degree of the ground - state degeneracy .",
    "however , on a more quantitative level there are many open questions .",
    "hence , a more fundamental theory is required .",
    "in conclusion , we find that the low - temperature thermal conductivity of the spin - ice compound @xmath1has a pronounced magnetic contribution in zero magnetic field .",
    "this has a strong magnetic - field dependence , which is highly anisotropic with respect to the magnetic - field direction .",
    "the magnitude of directly correlates with the degree of the ground - state degeneracy .",
    "it is maximum in zero field , where the ground - state degeneracy is maximum ( 6-fold ) . applying finite magnetic fields along different directions",
    "stabilize other ( spin - ice ) ground states with reduced degrees of degeneracy depending on the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field .",
    "a 3-fold degenerate kagom - ice phase occurs for below , where is reduced compared to the zero - field value , but remains larger than in the 2-fold degenerate ground state which is realized for .",
    "non - degenerate ground states are reached either for or for above and in both cases , vanishes completely . for",
    ", we observe an additional anisotropy of with respect to the direction of the heat current @xmath14 . for a heat current directed along the @xmath21  chains , whose spins are easily polarized because of their finite components along the field direction , is suppressed more strongly as compared to a heat current @xmath14 directed along the perpendicular oriented @xmath22  chains , whose spins are @xmath30 and are thus unaffected by the magnetic field .",
    "the anisotropy of with respect to the direction of @xmath14 is , however , too weak to be explained within a single spin - flip formalism that only accounts for nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "independent of the direction of the magnetic field , there are pronounced hysteresis effects when the magnetic field is reduced from larger values towards zero field in the low - temperature region . in all these cases , @xmath31 approaches a reduced value compared to @xmath32 obtained in the zero - field cooling process , and as a function of time , the reduced @xmath31 value slowly relaxes towards @xmath32 .",
    "this low - field hysteresis of @xmath31 correlates with the occurrence of a small , but finite remnant magnetization observed for all studied field directions at low temperature . for",
    ", however , we also observe a hysteresis of that has no analogue in the magnetization data . within the kagom - ice phase ,",
    "strongly depends on whether this phase is entered from zero or from high magnetic fields . increasing the magnetic field from the degenerate zero - field ground state results in a of the kagom - ice phase that is strongly reduced compared to the value of which",
    "is obtained when the kagom - ice phase is entered from above , _",
    "i.e._from the fully polarized state starting from higher fields .",
    "this larger is practically field - independent within the kagom - ice phase and it neither depends on time , whereas the lower slowly relaxes towards the larger plateau value .",
    "furthermore , we also identify a considerable field dependence of the phononic contribution which emerges at higher field , _ i.e. _  above the ( almost ) saturation of the magnetization .",
    "essentially , the same field - dependent is observed in the half - doped reference compound , where the spin - ice features are almost completely suppressed and all the above - described low - field features of are essentially absent .",
    "the field dependence of can be explained by lattice distortions due to torques on the non - collinear dy  momenta induced by the external magnetic field , and the resulting small tilts of the dy  momenta can also explain the continuous increase of the high - field magnetization .",

    "the 3-fold degeneracy of the kagom - ice phase can also be lifted by a weak misorientation of the magnetic field , but for small angles the resulting energy splitting of the different 2in-2out states is small .",
