    "many fundamental and practical scientific problems involve a wide range of length scales .",
    "typical examples may include subsurface flows and geophysical domains with microscopic structures . because there exist both natural randomness and lack of knowledge about the physical properties , it is often necessary to incorporate uncertainties into the model inputs .",
    "one way to address the uncertainties is to model the random inputs as a random field / process , and in turn , such problems are often modeled as stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) . then the model s output can be accurately predicted by efficiently solving the associated spdes .",
    "it is challenging to solve the spdes when the random inputs vary over multiple scales in space and contain inherent uncertainties .",
    "the interest in developing stochastic multiscale methods for the spdes has steadily grown in recent years ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of outcomes and @xmath1 be a bounded domain in @xmath2 with a lipschitz boundary .",
    "we consider the stochastic elliptic boundary value problem : seek a random field @xmath3 such that @xmath4 almost surely ( a.s ) satisfies the following equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a scalar random field . in particular , we assume that @xmath7 exhibits heterogeneity in multiple scales over space . since @xmath6 varies over different spatial scales , resolving the finest scale is not computationally feasible .",
    "thus , we use multiscale methods . in practice",
    ", a high dimensional random field can be used to approximate the stochastic field @xmath7 , yet computing the statistical output quantities of interest remains a difficult task .    during the last decade several multiscale methods have been developed , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the idea of multiscale methods is to divide the fine scale field into many local sub - problems and solve these in order to form a global coarse scale equation .",
    "this leads to a coarse scale equation in which the fine scale effects are taken into account .",
    "one such multiscale method is the multiscale finite element method ( msfem ) @xcite .",
    "the main idea of msfem is to incorporate the small - scale information into the finite element basis functions and capture their effects on the large scale through the discrete variational formulation . in many cases ,",
    "the multiscale basis functions can be pre - computed and used repeatedly in subsequent computations with different source terms , boundary conditions and even modified coefficients .",
    "the goal in this paper is to quantify the uncertainty through computing the statistical moments ( e.g. , expectation and variance ) of the stochastic solution .",
    "we note that the variance of the solution gives a measure for confidence of the solution expectation .",
    "numerical solution strategies for stochastic pdes generally follow three main steps .",
    "first , the random inputs are approximately parameterized by a finite number of random variables .",
    "this can be achieved by a truncated karhunen - love expansion and/or truncated polynomial chaos expansion @xcite .",
    "second , a numerical approximation for the resulting high - dimensional deterministic pde is used to approximate the solution with the respective input parameters . finally , the solution is reconstructed as a random field and the statistical quantities of interest are computed .",
    "the second step is most difficult because the pdes involve high - dimensional random parameter inputs .",
    "there exist many methods for the second step .",
    "a broad survey of these methods can be found in @xcite . among these methods ,",
    "monte carlo and stochastic collocation methods have been extensively studied and widely used .",
    "monte carlo methods and stochastic collocation methods generate completely decoupled systems , each of which is the same size as the deterministic system .",
    "this is suitable for parallel computing and amendable for relatively high - dimensional random inputs . in a monte carlo context",
    ", a large number of samples are randomly chosen and separate solves for each of the samples are used to determine the statistical behavior of solutions . however , a limitation is that convergence of monte carlo methods is usually slow .",
    "unlike monte carlo methods , stochastic collocation requires independent solves at fixed collocation points which are specifically chosen . in turn",
    ", this type of method has the capability to provide better accuracy than monte carlo with a fewer number of realizations . moreover , to overcome the _ curse of dimensionality _ imposed by high - dimensional input parameters , we can use smolyak sparse grids ( see e.g. , @xcite ) to reduce the number of collocation points . in this paper",
    ", we consider the monte carlo method and the smolyak sparse grid collocation method for stochastic approximation .    in the paper ,",
    "we consider both multiscale features and uncertainties simultaneously .",
    "a main focus is the use of a resourceful splitting technique to compute msfem basis functions . for the problem ( [ model - spde ] ) , we assume that the coefficient @xmath8 can be split into two parts , @xmath9 .",
    "we then construct green s functions using the differential operator associated with @xmath10 .",
    "the green s functions are used to construct a sequence of multiscale `` bubble functions , '' which are employed to build the multiscale basis functions for msfem in an iterative manner .",
    "the green s function technique provides an modified framework to compute the bubble functions , and is suitable for parallel computing due to the independent construction .",
    "the splitting of @xmath8 is flexible and can be easily controlled to lead to fast convergence of the bubble function sequence .",
    "compared to standard msfem @xcite , the proposed msfem approach can accurately approximate multiscale solutions .",
    "the new multiscale approach is applied to spdes and may result in new stochastic multiscale methods . since the green s functions essentially generate the msfem basis functions , this will reduce the dimension of random parameter space if the dimension of the random field for @xmath10 is smaller than that of the random field for @xmath8 .",
    "we note that using karhunen - love expansion or polynomial chaos expansion usually yields an inherent splitting .",
    "the new msfem can efficiently solve spdes with high - dimensional input parameters , and combining the approach with sparse grid collocation methods alleviates the need for a prohibitive number of deterministic solves .",
    "we present convergence analysis of the proposed msfem approach for deterministic elliptic equations and stochastic elliptic equations .",
    "complexity analysis is also presented for deterministic msfem basis functions and stochastic msfem basis functions .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath11 we present the splitting technique which is used to compute the new msfem basis functions for deterministic elliptic pdes , and provide the associated computational algorithm . in section",
    "@xmath12 , convergence analysis is rigorously derived for deterministic elliptic pdes .",

    "( [ model - eq ] ) was introduced in @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient of msfem is the construction of an appropriate multiscale finite dimensional space in which the solution is sought .",

    "we use the same kle configurations as in subsection  [ stochresults ] .    to motivate further disussion , we first offer table  [ error ] which compares the monte carlo sampling approach with the new parameter reduction sampling approach . the values in the table result from keeping @xmath409 terms for construction of @xmath10 combined with interpolation levels @xmath429 , @xmath307 , and @xmath430 .",
    "in particular , we tabulate the values @xmath431 for @xmath14 fixed @xmath219 ( random parameter ) values , where @xmath162 denotes the standard msfem solution with monte carlo sampling , and @xmath432 denotes the proposed msfem solution with the parameter reduction approach . as we can see from table  [ error ] , the parameter reduction approach closely recovers each individual sample of the elliptic solution , and a higher interpolation level leads to smaller errors . in all cases we note that the relative errors do not exceed @xmath433 .",

    "[ collstatplot ] we offer analogous results to those found in the previous subsection .",
    "namely , we plot @xmath231 vs. the mean and variance quantities of the relative errors , @xmath434 and @xmath435 , where we recall that @xmath163 denotes the standard msfem solution technique combined with monte carlo sampling .",
    "in essence , we use these expected errors as benchmarks for comparison with the proposed method . more specifically ,",
    "we are interested in comparing standard msfem with monte carlo sampling against the proposed msfem approach with parameter reduction collocation .",
    "we first note that an increase in interpolation level clearly yields a decrease in the relative error values .",
    "the level 2 interpolation errors nearly match the monte carlo results , and this slight discrepancy may be viewed as a trade of the increased efficiency of the proposed method . in other words , for a moderate collocation level",
    "it is natural to expect some minimal error contributions from collocation .",
    "however , the level 3 interpolation yields errors that are nearly identical to the monte carlo results .",
    "this is due to the fact that the collocation error is essentially dimished , and the only remaining error is due to the splitting .",
    "this will be discussed in further detail below . in fig .",
    "[ meanvarl3 ] we single out the @xmath430 results and plot them with the monte carlo results .",

    ", we emphasize that _ all _ plots from fig .",
    "[ collstatplot ] illustrate relative errors that do not exceed @xmath433 .",
    "even though the level 1 results do not closely match the monte carlo results , a neglible error of @xmath438 may be completely acceptable for many applications . in particular , the small vertical scale should be duely noted . from the @xmath429 results we conclude that the proposed sampling method is not sensitive with respect to @xmath228 , and fewer terms",
    "may be kept in the kl expansion without a significant loss in accuracy .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath322 is dominant for the basic collocation level .",
    "these results can be viewed as a potential limitation and advantage of the approach if a level 1 interpolant is used .",
    "it may be a potential limitation because the addition of terms does not decrease the expected error significantly .",
    "however , these results may also be viewed as an advantage since 14 terms in a 20 term kl expansion ( for example ) yields similar errors as 18 terms in a 20 terms kl expansion .",
    "thus , fewer terms may be used in the decomposition with a neglible loss in accuracy . however , as the results show , no sacrifice in accuracy is necessary if a higher interpolation level is used .",
    "this would simply amount to more precomputation steps in which additional sparse grid points are considered for the smolyak interpolant .",
    "we also test the sensitivity of the approach with respect to the number of terms @xmath350 which are kept in eq .  .",
    "all previous results in this subsection were obtained from a value of @xmath436 in the expansions ; however , it is fitting to offer a comparison between solutions obtained by keeping more terms in the expansion .",
    "for the following comparisons we use the same level 1 interpolation results as seen in fig .",
    "[ collstatplot ] and test the results corresponding to @xmath436 and @xmath371 . in fig .",
    "[ jcompare ] we note that the method does not exhibit sensitivity with respect to @xmath350 .",
    "this is again due to the fact that the collocation error is dominant for a level @xmath429 interpolation .",
    "we see that the mean errors may be slightly decreased by keeping more terms in the series expansion , yet this increase in accuracy is subtle .",
    "this may be attributed to the fact that the @xmath429 green s function interpolant @xmath439 in eq .",
    "does not guarantee faster convergence depending on the number of terms kept in the series expansion .",
    "more specifically , the dominant collocation error is inhereted through the iterative procedure . as more terms",
    "do not yield a significant gain in accuracy , keeping less terms is preferable in this low interpolation level setting .",
    "however , as the splitting error becomes dominant ( i.e. , a higher interpolation level is considered ) using more @xmath350 terms would , in fact , result in more pronounced accuracy .",
    "we next elaborate on some additional effects of a higher interpolation level .",
    ", @xmath440 , scaledwidth=90.0% ]    to finish this section we offer detailed relative error comparisons for @xmath441 ( total error ) , @xmath442 ( splitting error ) , and @xmath443 ( collocation error ) . in doing so ,",
    "the aim is to solidify the contention that a higher interpolation level indeed diminishes the the collocation error . in turn , if the neglible total error ( @xmath438 ) which results from a lower level interpolation ( e.g. , @xmath429 ) is not suitable , a higher level interpolation ( e.g. , @xmath430 ) may be used to negate the collocation error . to reiterate , @xmath220 denotes a solution obtained from the proposed msfem approach with monte carlo sampling , and @xmath313 denotes a solution obtained from the proposed msfem approach with parameter reduction .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ methodcompare ] for an illustration of the various errors .",
    "we introduce a slight abuse of the original notation from subsection  [ paramreduc ] , and use @xmath444 to denote the total _ relative _ error , @xmath321 to denote the _ relative _ splitting error , and @xmath322 to denote the _ relative _ collocation error in fig .",
    "[ methodcompare ] . in the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ methodcompare ] we note that the smallest errors result from the proposed msfem combined with monte carlo sampling ( i.e. , the splitting error is small ) .",
    "in addition , the total error and collocation error are comparable .",
    "thus , we conclude that the collocation approach yields the dominant soure of error for a low level interpolant . however , we note the significant difference in the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ methodcompare ] . in this case",
    "we note two important factors .",
    "first , the total error from a @xmath430 interpolant is smaller than its @xmath429 counterpart ( as expected ) .",
    "furthermore , we see that the splitting error is now the dominant source of error , and the collocation error is much smaller . in other words ,",
    "an increase in the interpolation level accomplishes the task of significantly reducing the collocation error .",

    "in this paper we present a new msfem approach for solving elliptic equations with coefficients that vary on many length scales and contain uncertainties . through considering a coefficient decomposition combined with a green s function approach ,",
    "we are able to construct new msfem solutions which closely recover traditional msfem solutions . in a deterministic setting ,",
    "rigorous error estimates and bounds are first presented for a representative basis function within the msfem approximation space . using the initial basis function results ,",
    "we offer a rigorous error analysis describing the behavior of the elliptic solutions that are sought in the space that is spanned by the new multiscale basis functions . under appropriate assumptions on the coefficient splitting configuration , we are ultimately able to construct approximate solutions which nicely converge to a benchmark solution . the basis function and elliptic solution analysis are thoroughly verified through a number of representative numerical examples . in a stochastic",
    "setting , the proposed solution method is shown to reduce the number of sample solutions that must be constructed for assessing the statistical behavior of the system .",
    "in particular , the splitting gives rise to a situation where the random parameter dimension can be reduced , and where stochastic collocation becomes an efficient alternative to direct monte carlo sampling . as the parameter reduction sampling approach involves a number of pre - computation steps that are completely independent , this approach is especially desirable in a parallel setting .",
