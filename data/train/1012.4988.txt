    "holographic models of late acceleration have become of fashion , among other things , because they link the dark energy density to the cosmic horizon , a global property of the universe , and have a close relationship to the spacetime foam @xcite , @xcite . for a summary motivation of holographic dark energy ,",
    "see section 3 in @xcite .",
    "the cosmological model we present here assumes a spatially flat homogeneous and isotropic universe dominated by dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) ( subscripts @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively ) , the latter obeying the holographic relationship @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a dimensionless parameter that we will take as constant -though strictly speaking it may slowly vary with time @xcite- , and @xmath4 denotes the ricci s lenght .",
    "we adopt the latter because it corresponds to the size of the maximal perturbation leading to the formation of a black hole @xcite . for models that identify @xmath5 with hubble s length , @xmath6 , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "the other main assumption is that de and dm interact non - gravitationally with each other according to @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 stand for the fractional densities of the components , and the interaction term @xmath10 is such that ratio @xmath11 evolves from a constant value at early times to a final , finite , value -denoted as @xmath12- at late times ( see @xcite for details and fig . [",
    "fig : r ] ) .",
    "this clearly alleviates the coincidence problem ( namely ,  why are the densities of matter and dark energy of the same order precisely today ? \"",
    "@xcite ) , something beyond the reach of the @xmath13cdm model .",
    "a consequence of the model is that the equation of state of dark energy @xmath14 varies with expansion as shown in fig .",

    "the model has four free parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath24 ) which we constrained with observational data from supernovae ( 557 data points @xcite ) , cosmic background radiation @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations ( at @xmath25 @xcite and @xmath26 @xcite ) , gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters ( 42 data points from x - ray measurements @xcite ) , the hubble function history ( 15 data points @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) , and the growth function ( 5 data points from table 2 in @xcite ) . ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "data from the growth function -which correspond to matter perturbations within the horizon- are particularly relevant because they can more easily discriminate between cosmological models with a similar history of the hubble function . for the model under consideration",
    "the growth function of matter , @xmath27 , is governed by @xmath28 in the non - interacting limit , @xmath29 , this expression reduces to the corresponding one of the einstein - de sitter cosmology , namely : @xmath30 f = 3\\omega_{m}/2 $ ] .",

    "this together table [ table : chi2 ] and figures [ fig:3elipses ] and [ fig:2elipses ] summarizes our findings .",
    "it is worthy of note that the non - interacting case , @xmath35 ( which implies @xmath36 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : qchim ] ) ) , lies over @xmath22 away from the best fit value .",
    "this seems to be a generic feature of holographic models .",
    "table [ table : chi2 ] shows the partial , total , and total @xmath37 over the number of degrees of freedom of the holographic model along with the corresponding values for the @xmath13cdm model .",
    "the latter has just two free parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath24 .",
