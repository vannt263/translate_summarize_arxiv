    "the parton evolution at small values of @xmath2 is believed to be best described by the ccfm evolution equation , which for @xmath3 is equivalent to the bfkl evolution equation and for large @xmath2 reproduce the standard dglap equations .",
    "the ccfm evolution equation takes coherence effects of the radiated gluons into account via angular ordering . on the basis of this evolution equation",
    ", the monte carlo program smallx has been developed already in 1992 . in 1997",
    "the linked dipole chain was developed as a reformulation of the original ccfm equation .",
    "predictions of the ccfm equation for hadronic final state properties were studied in  @xcite paying special attention to non - leading effects .",
    "all approaches   found a good description of @xmath0 but failed completely to describe the forward jet data of hera experiments , which are believed to be a signature for new small @xmath2 parton dynamics .    in the following",
    "i discuss the treatment of the non - sudakov form factor @xmath1 as well as the effects of the so - called  consistency constraint \" , which was found to be necessary to include non - leading contributions to the bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "i show that a good description of @xmath0 and the forward jet data can be achieved .",
    "the implementation of the ccfm   parton evolution in the forward evolution monte carlo program smallx is described in detail in  .",
    "here i only concentrate on the basic ideas and discuss the treatment of the non - sudakov form factor .",
    "the initial state gluon cascade is generated in a forward evolution approach from a starting distribution of the @xmath4 unintegrated gluon distribution according to : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a normalization constant and @xmath7  gev@xmath8 .",
    "gluons then can branch into a virtual ( @xmath9-channel ) gluon @xmath10 and a final gluon @xmath11 according to the ccfm splitting function : @xmath12 with @xmath13 being the rescaled transverse momentum , @xmath14 , @xmath15 being a collinear cutoff to avoid the @xmath16 singularity and @xmath17 being the sudakov form factor : @xmath18 which at an inclusive level cancels against the @xmath16 collinear singularity and is used to generate @xmath19 .",
    "the gluon splitting function @xmath20 is given by : @xmath21 with the non - sudakov form factor @xmath1 being defined as : @xmath22 which gives for the region @xmath23 : @xmath24 the constraint @xmath23 is often referred to as the  consistency constraint \"  @xcite .",
    "however the upper limit of the @xmath25 integral is constraint by the @xmath26 functions in eq.([ns ] ) by : @xmath27 , which results in the following form of the non - sudakov form factor @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 giving no supression in the region @xmath30 we have @xmath31 .",
    "the monte carlo program smallx   has been modified to include the non - sudakov form factor according to eq.([ns_new ] ) and the scale in @xmath32 was changed to @xmath33 in the cascade and in the matrix element . to avoid problems at small @xmath34 , @xmath35",
    "is restricted to @xmath36 .",
    "the  consistency constraint \" was introduced to account for next - to - leading effects in the bfkl equation , and which was found @xcite to simulate about 70% of the full next - to - leading corrections to the bfkl equation . since in lo bfkl the true kinematics of the branchings are neglected , they can be interpreted as next - to - leading effects , and this constraint is often also called  kinematic constraint \" . in the ccfm equation energy and momentum conservation is already included at lo , and it is not clear , whether the arguments coming from bfkl also apply to ccfm . in the following the effects of the @xmath16 terms and the  consistency constraint \" are studied in more detail .",
    "with the modifications on the treatment of the non - sudakov form factors described above , the predictions of the ccfm evolution equation , as implemented in the program smallx  , for the structure function @xmath37 are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2_1 ] without applying any additional  consistency constraint \" .",
    "-15 mm -10 mm    here the following parameters were used : @xmath38  gev , @xmath39  gev , @xmath40 and the masses for light ( charm ) quarks were set to @xmath41  gev .",
    "the scale of @xmath32 in the off - shell matrix element was set to @xmath34 . with this parameter settings",
    "are very good description of @xmath0 over the range @xmath42 and @xmath43  gev@xmath8 is obtained . in fig .",
    "[ fwd_jets_1 ] the prediction for the forward jets using the same parameter setting is shown .",
    "the data are nicely described .",
    "-12 mm -8 mm    the effect of the @xmath16 term in the splitting function is shown in figs .",
    "[ f2_1 ] and [ fwd_jets_1 ] separately with the dashed line .",
    "it is obvious that these terms are important for a reasonable description of @xmath0 and the forward jet data .",
    "including the  consistency constraint \" the @xmath2 dependence of the cross section changes , but a similarly good description of @xmath0 is obtained by changing @xmath44 to @xmath45 gev .",

    "[ f2_1 ] and [ fwd_jets_1 ] .",
