    "in this paper we are going to study the dynamical evolution of a class of anisotropic universes in quadratic theories of gravity . these extensions of general relativity ( gr )",
    "provide guidance as to the possible effects of quantum corrections to the einstein equations .",
    "they permit us to investigate the possible effects on singularity formation , inflation , and the expansion dynamics of the early universe .",
    "past studies of these extensions have focused on the isotropic friedmann metrics , where it is sufficient to consider only the effects of an @xmath0 term in the gravitational lagrangian to the field equations @xcite . however , the @xmath0 contribution has fairly predictable cosmological consequences because the resulting quadratic vacuum theory is conformally equivalent to gr with a scalar field moving in a potential with a single asymmetric minimum @xcite .",
    "this type of solution has been well studied in connection with inflation @xcite and in the situation of pure power - law lagrangians of the form @xmath1 , schmidt , bc , bc1 , bc2 .",
    "the addition of the @xmath2 ricci term to the lagrangian in the case of an anisotropic universe creates a much richer diversity of cosmological behaviours that are harder to summarise in terms of simple modifications of the general - relativistic situation .",
    "the effective stresses that are contributed to the field equations by the quadratic ricci terms in the lagrangian can mimic a wide range of fluids which violate the strong and weak energy conditions .",
    "this allows completely different behaviour to occur than is found in gr or its quadratic extension with pure @xmath0 contributions .",
    "in particular , we have shown elsewhere that the cosmic no - hair theorems no longer hold : vacuum universes with positive cosmological constant do not necessarily approach de sitter , but can inflate anisotropically @xcite . moreover",
    ", the addition of quadratic ricci terms to the lagrangian can create cosmological models which have no counterpart in the gr limit of the theory .    in what follows , we are going to widen this investigation by considering the global dynamics of the bianchi type i and ii universes in the presence of quadratic ricci and scalar curvature contributions to the lagrangian .",
    "whilst these anisotropic universes contain some mathematical simplifications , they include spatially homogeneous expanding universes with isotropic ( type i ) and anisotropic ( type ii ) spatial 3-curvatures as well as expansion shear anisotropy . to this end",
    ", we consider the gravitational action @xmath3variation of this action leads to the following generalised einstein equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath4where @xmath5 is the energy - momentum tensor of the ordinary matter sources , which in this paper we will assume to be zero , for simplicity , @xmath6with @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the metric tensor and @xmath9  the cosmological constant .",
    "the effective stress tensor @xmath10 incorporates the deviation from regular einstein gravity introduced by the quadratic terms in the action , and we see that @xmath11 implies @xmath12although the converse need not be true .    similarly , by rescaling @xmath13 we can consider the limit @xmath14 .",
    "this limit , whenever it exists , corresponds to the case where the action only contains quadratic terms , hence eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) reduces to ( for vacuum , @xmath15 ) @xmath16it is important to consider the vacuum solutions to the pure quadratic theories ; that is , solutions to eq.([phi=0 ] ) .",
    "first , we note that any einstein metric with @xmath17 , necessarily obeys @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , this implies that _ any gr vacuum solution ( @xmath19 ) will also be a vacuum solution to the quadratic theory ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "_ this means that there will be chaotic dynamics in the quadratic theory because it is present in a number of general - relativistic vacuum bianchi models ( types vi@xmath21 , viii , and ix ) near an initial curvature singularity ; however it might not be stable in solutions to the quadratic theories in the way that it appears to be for these solutions in gr .",
    "second , there are some specific solutions to @xmath18 , which are not solutions to @xmath22 and so have no counterparts in the @xmath23 general - relativity limit of the quadratic theory .",
    "this feature plays an important role in the evolution of universes that arise in these theories .",
    "for example , one such intrinsically quadratic solution is a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe which has expansion dynamics similar to those of a radiation - dominated universe in gr .",
    "this means that if we take a frw universe with spatial curvature parameter @xmath24 , there is a simple solution to @xmath18 given by the metric that solves the field equations of gr @xmath25 in the presence of black - body radiation : @xmath26 .",
    "\\label{quadrad}\\]]note that despite the fact that @xmath15 this quadratic universe behaves as if it is radiation - dominated .",
    "this radiation - like universe seems to play a special role in the theory as it will be found to act as a past attractor for the anisotropic universes we study .",
    "other interesting conclusions can also be deduced from this simple solution .",
    "we see , for example , that unlike for the gr case , in the quadratic theory there is a closed ( @xmath27 ) frw _ vacuum _ solution which recollapses after a finite time @xmath28 and a flat @xmath29 vacuum solution .    there are some further geometrical observations regarding solutions to these quadratic theories that will be useful . in 4d spacetimes",
    "we can use the weyl curvature invariant and the euler density , @xmath30 , defined by , @xmath31to replace the quadratic ricci invariant in the action , since @xmath32since integration over the euler density is a topological invariant , the variation of @xmath30 will not contribute to the equations of motion . from this",
    "we see that there are two special cases    * @xmath33 : the conformally invariant bach - weyl gravity theory @xcite .",
    "* @xmath34 : a special case of @xmath35 gravity .",
    "since the equations of motion change their structure in these two special cases , a separate analysis is required for each .",
    "so , in what follows we will assume that @xmath36on the other hand , our formulation of the equations of motion is well defined in the @xmath14 limit ( as explained above ) .    in our analysis",
    ", we will adopt the dynamical systems approach by introducing expansion - normalised variables .",
    "this approach has proven to be extremely successful in the analysis of spatially homogeneous bianchi universes in gr @xcite . however , by considering quadratic theories of gravity there are some extra complications added to the formalism , as the universe can bounce or recollapse at expansion minima and maxima , which leads to infinities in the expansion - normalised variables . here",
    ", we will discuss these infinities and explain how a sequence of expanding and contracting phases can be considered .",
    "on the other hand , initial singularities and future asymptotes are all finite in these variables , and the dynamical systems approach is ideal for studying such regimes .    in a recent paper by leach _",
    "et al _ @xcite , a dynamical systems approach to the local rotational symmetric bianchi type i universes was considered within a class of @xmath35 theories . in particular , they were interested in the shear dynamics of such universes , and , interestingly , they found that there is a possibility for an isotropic singularity .",
    "the introduction of a @xmath2 term introduces extra shear degrees of freedom and their higher time derivatives , which considerately complicate the equations of motion .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that the case we study is is a quite separate , and we consider more general bianchi models , we also find the possibility for an isotropic singularity , as did cotsakis et al cotsakis in their study of bianchi type ix universes in quadratic theories .",
    "indeed , we will argue that this isotropic singularity is past stable for _ all bianchi models_.",
    "our starting point is the generalised vacuum field equations : @xmath37we note that the gr - limit can be obtained by letting @xmath38 . now consider the spatially homogeneous bianchi metrics .",
    "we can always write their metric line - elements as @xmath39where @xmath40 is a triad of one - forms obeying @xmath41the @xmath42 depend only on time and at any moment of constant time are the structure constants of the bianchi group - type under consideration , and @xmath43 means projection onto the spatially - homogeneous hypersurfaces .",

    "the @xmath75 case corresponds to a purely quadratic lagrangian theory whose equations of motion reduce to @xmath18 .",
    "the equations of motion define a dynamical flow in a large phase volume , and the behaviour can be analysed qualitatively by standard techniques from the theory of ordinary differential equations .",
    "of particular interest are the exact solutions which define the critical points of the system and their stability at small and large times .",
    "the de sitter solution is characterised by the critical points where @xmath77its stability is determined by the eigenvalues : @xmath78,~-\\frac{3}{2}\\left ( 1\\pm \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4[b+2(4-\\chi ) ] } { 9\\chi } } \\right ) [ \\times 2]\\]]the zero eigenvalue corresponds to the variable @xmath72 and appears because these solutions are a one - parameter family .",
    "the last three eigenvalues arise from the shear equations and come therefore in pairs .",

    "therefore the case @xmath80 has 4 fewer variables , which correspond to the last two pairs of eigenvalues given above . ] .",
    "we note that @xmath83 in particular , this means that whenever @xmath84 , @xmath85 the de sitter solution has two unstable modes .",
    "these modes stem from the shear equations and are therefore not present for the frw models studied earlier . on the other hand , if @xmath86 and @xmath87 then the de sitter solution is stable .",
    "a related set of equilibrium points is @xmath88the eigenvalues for this line bifurcation is the same as for the de sitter solution restricted to @xmath75 .",
    "consequently , there exist two zero eigenvalues for this set of solutions .",

    "due to the zero - eigenvalue the decay of the solutions as they asymptote to the equilibrium point will be power - law ( compared to exponential ) in the dynamical time , @xmath63 .",
    "hence , at sufficiently early ( or late ) time , the decay rates will be dominated by the power - law behaviour . in the phase space",

    "note that , after requiring analyticity , we have the transition @xmath223 at @xmath194 .",
    "for @xmath75 on the approach to @xmath30 we have @xmath224 at late times unlike the general case ( @xmath139 ) for which the evolution gives @xmath225 at late times .",
    "the behaviour of general frw universes ( @xmath139 ) can be split into 5 different possibilities .",
    "the evolution can be as follows ( see fig.fig:frw ) :    1 .",
    "@xmath203 : @xmath226 .",
    "@xmath125 : @xmath227 .",
    "@xmath125 : @xmath228 .",
    "@xmath125 : @xmath229 .",
    "@xmath125 : @xmath230 .",
    "the last possibility suggests that it might even be possible for a universe to experience a sequence of expanding and collapsing phases ( recall that a collapsing phase can be described by the same equations by running the dynamical time , @xmath63 , backwards ) .",
    "in the analysis above we have seen that there are ( at least ) three possibilities for past behaviour of bianchi models .",
    "let us discuss each of these in turn .",
    "again , we should emphasise that the list of equilibrium points for the bianchi type ii case is not exhaustive , and therefore behaviours other than these might occur in the general type ii solution .",
    "we have already seen that the radiation - like frw universe denoted @xmath231 , is an attractor for the models studied here .",
    "this creates the possibility for an isotropic past singularity in these theories .",
    "hence , the quadratic theories of gravity studied here seem to have an isotropisation mechanism into the past provided by the quadratic curvature contributions .",
    "let us give an argument that this isotropic singularity is indeed an attractor _ for all bianchi models_.      as explained earlier , the various bianchi models can be described in terms of the structure coefficients via the symmetric tensor @xmath232 and the vector @xmath44 .",
    "the evolution of these curvature variables are determined by the jacobi identity ; hence , the evolution of @xmath232 and @xmath44 are therefore theory - independent . introducing expansion - normalised variables in the standard manner",
    ", we obtain the equations of motion close to the isotropic singularity : @xmath233since @xmath234 for the attractor @xmath107 , we have @xmath235and hence each quantity decays to the past @xmath92 .",
    "we do expect extra shear modes to appear ; however , if we introduce the corresponding expansion - normalised variables for these modes , the evolution equations are , to linear order , the same as for @xmath236 .",
    "consequently , this would give eigenvalues @xmath237 for each of the additional shear modes .",
    "therefore , we expect the shear to decay as @xmath238at early times  as @xmath92 . this is consistent with the situation found for the bianchi type ix model by cotsakis et al cotsakis .      with regards to the influence of matter on the evolution ,",
    "let us assume the presence of a comoving perfect fluid with a barotropic equation of state : @xmath239    introducing an expansion - normalised energy - density , @xmath240 , the conservation of energy yields the equation of motion : @xmath241\\omega .\\]]hence , we have for the evolution of the fluid density with volume expansion , @xmath242 and there is a change of behaviour of @xmath243 at @xmath244 .",
    "however , in the evolution equations @xmath243 only appears as part of the product @xmath245 .",
    "this means that for all regular matter with @xmath246 the matter term is subdominant and the isotropic singularity is stable to the past . in gr the situation is very different , and stability is only possible when @xmath247 @xcite .",
    "these conclusions have been drawn for the case of irrotational matter only .",
    "the situation with rotation or non - comoving 4-velocities , where @xmath248 is not hypersurface orthogonal remains to be investigated .",
    "we know from experience with bianchi - type universes in general relativity that the introduction of all the possible non - comoving velocity components can produce a situation that is delicately sensitive to the equation of state because of the role played by the pressure and density in the conservation of angular momenta around the three orthogonal expansion axes , see refs vort , tilt .",
    "the evolution of fluids possessing anisotropic pressures is also interesting and is likely to play a very important role in the late - time evolution of these universes , notably in the case where the anisotropic fluid has vanishing trace and is accompanied by an isotropic black - body radiation fluid .",
    "however , the way in which the quadratic ricci terms have been found to mimic the effect of an isotropic radiation stress implies that the presence of a pure trace - free stress ( for example a pure magnetic field ) may evolve in an influential way in these theories , just as was found in the case of general relativity @xcite .",
    "the kasner circle is an attractor for some orbits of type i and ii and in these models this behaviour is therefore typical .",
    "the type ii modes cause transitions between different points on the kasner circle and since this is an exact solution for ordinary gr we expect chaos as we go to the more general vacuum type viii , ix and vi@xmath21 models .",
    "however , even though chaotic solutions exist , we do not know whether this chaotic set is an attractor for typical orbits .",
    "we have seen that there are bouncing solutions for the type i and ii universes .",
    "however , even though this behaviour seems to be typical for these models it is unclear whether they are typical for more general bianchi models .",
    "the bouncing solutions correspond to solutions coming from infinity of the state space and are therefore particularly challenging to analyse . apart from for the frw case , rigorous results regarding the generality of these bouncing solutions are not known .",
    "the stability of the frw behaviour in the type ix case @xcite indicates that the closed frw bounce behaviour will occur there but there may be other behaviours that are stable far from isotropy which have not yet been identified . the possibility for bounce",
    "is closely related to the possibility of recollapsing solutions in these theories .",
    "however , the analysis of this kind of behaviour using expansion - normalised variables is plagued by the fact that the state variables diverge .",
    "it does seem that recollapsing solutions are typical but a more rigorous analysis is lacking at the present time .",
    "the future behaviour of these cosmologies shows a dependence of the parameters of the theory . unlike in general relativity",
    ", there does not exist a simple no - hair theorem when @xmath143 for the vacuum case , or where matter obeys the strong - energy condition . as discussed in our earlier paper , ref @xcite ,",
    "this situation arises because the contribution of the @xmath249 stresses to the field equations ( [ field ] ) can mimic the form of a fluid with negative density and or pressures and so the energy - conditions assumed to hold in the general - relativistic no - hair theorems are effectively violated by the non - linear curvature terms .",
    "we showed that there exist vacuum solutions with @xmath143 which do not approach de sitter at late times : they inflate anisotropically .",
    "a similar effect can be seen in the study of kaloper into the effects of the chern - simons terms on the behaviour of a class of bianchi type universes @xcite .",
    "however , conditions can be identified for which de sitter is an attractor at late times .      for de sitter to be an attractor we need @xmath203 and @xmath250/\\beta < 0 $ ] . however , even in this case , numerical simulations indicate that this behaviour is typical but not generic .",
    "but in the cases where @xmath125 , another late - time behaviour is possible :      for @xmath125 and @xmath251 or @xmath252 the equilibrium point @xmath30 is a future attractor . due to the presence of a non - trivial centre manifold",
    ", the universe generically approaches this point with a power - law evolution .",
    "as the solutions approach @xmath30 , the universe eventually has @xmath253 and @xmath131 $ ] .    lately , there has been an interest for so - called `` phantom cosmologies '' with @xmath254 which can end in a singularity within finite time ( a so - called big rip ) .",
    "the evolution described above has eventually @xmath254 but approaches @xmath255 sufficiently fast to avoid the big rip@xcite .",
    "the deceleration parameter approaches @xmath256 from below , while the hubble scalar diverges linearly in cosmological time .",
    "other types of finite - time singularity are possible in which @xmath49 and @xmath257 remain finite but there is an infinity of the pressure and the acceleration @xcite .",
    "these sudden singularities occur without any violation of the strong - energy condition .",
    "it appears likely that they will occur in these quadratic theories also .",
    "the situation in the presence of lagrangians that involved only @xmath258 was discussed in ref .",
    "in this paper we have provided a study of a range of anisotropic universes in a quadratic theory of gravity involving all allowed quadratic curvature invariants to appear in the lagrangian .",
    "we have seen that there is a possibility for a stable ( or even generic ) isotropic singularity in quadratic theories of gravity .",
    "there is a isotropic equilibrium point , representing a frw universe with scale factor @xmath259 that is a solution of the _ vacuum _ field equations of the quadratic theory , which is stable into the past . here , for simplicity ,",
    "we have only considered bianchi type i and type ii models , but these incorporate both shear and 3-curvature anisotropies , and an argument was given that this is also a past attractor for more general bianchi models .",
    "therefore , it appears that including quadratic terms provides us with a new mechanism for constraining the initial singularity to be isotropic .",
    "this is reminiscent of the situation proposed by weyl * *  * * curvature hypothesis , which envisages some measure of the weyl curvature playing the role of a gravitational entropy , so it must initially be small ( or zero , up to quantum corrections ) in order to provide a subsequent gravitational arrow of time @xcite .",
    "however , it must not be the case that the quadratic stresses drive the expansion towards isotropy on approach to any future singularity if the universe is closed and recollapses .",
    "this study raises many questions for further investigation of anisotropic and inhomogeneous cosmologies that are more general than those considered here , which we will report elsewhere .",
    "we have also found that the presence of quadratic curvature terms leads to a range of new possibilities in situations which would be expected to yield simple de sitter inflation in gr .",
    "the presence of a stress with @xmath260 need not produce future evolution towards the isotropic de sitter metric locally .",
    "there is a possibility for inflationary behaviour which is anisotropic because of the effective stresses being contributed to the field equations by the quadratic terms .    in ordinary gr ,",
    "the general bianchi types have been shown to possess a chaotic behaviour as we approach the initial singularity .",
    "this chaotic behaviour consists of a sequence of kasner regimes connected via vacuum type ii transitions and possibly frame rotations . on a dynamical time scale , the transitions are fairly short compared to the kasner epochs @xcite .",
    "therefore , since we noticed that the kasner circle does indeed act as a past attractor for some type i orbits , we could expect chaos to be present for typical orbits in the more general bianchi models .",
    "certainly , the chaotic vacuum type ix mixmaster universe is a particular exact solution of the quadratic theory and its chaotic behaviour has been discussed in the presence of the quadratic terms @xcite and it remains to be seen whether another form of chaotic evolution might arise , and be stable , far from the isotropic closed frw radiation - like model .",
